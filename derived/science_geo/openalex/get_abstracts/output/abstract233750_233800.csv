https://openalex.org/W2100817247,"Amyloid fibrillization is multistep process involving soluble oligomeric intermediates, including spherical oligomers and protofibrils. Amyloid oligomers have a common, generic structure, and they are intrinsically toxic to cells, even when formed from non-disease related proteins, which implies they also share a common mechanism of pathogenesis and toxicity. Here we report that soluble oligomers from several types of amyloids specifically increase lipid bilayer conductance regardless of the sequence, while fibrils and soluble low molecular weight species have no effect. The increase in membrane conductance occurs without any evidence of discrete channel or pore formation or ion selectivity. The conductance is dependent on the concentration of oligomers and can be reversed by anti-oligomer antibody. These results indicate that soluble oligomers from many types of amyloidogenic proteins and peptides increase membrane conductance in a conformation-specific fashion and suggest that this may represent the common primary mechanism of pathogenesis in amyloid-related degenerative diseases.

Soluble amyloid oligomers are a common intermediate in the pathway for amyloid fibril formation and have been implicated as the primary toxic species of amyloids related to neurodegenerative disease (1Lambert M.P.

Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). More recent reports indicate that soluble amyloid oligomers are intrinsically toxic even when they are formed from proteins that are not normally related to degenerative disease (3Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar), and the toxic activity of soluble oligomers may be related to a common generic structure that they share (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Although the primary mechanism of amyloid toxicity is not clear, the fact that different amyloids reside in either the cytosolic or extracellular compartments and the observation that cytosolic amyloid aggregates are toxic when applied externally to cells (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar, 7Bodles A.M. Guthrie D.J. Harriott P. Campbell P. Irvine G.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2186-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) points to the cell plasma membrane as a potential primary target of amyloid pathogenesis. Indeed, there are many reports of membrane perturbations caused by amyloids like Aβ (8Kagan B.L. Hirakura Y. Azimov R. Azimova R. Lin M.C. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but it isn't clear whether these effects are specific to soluble oligomers nor whether they are common to other types of amyloids. Here we report that homogeneous populations of spherical amyloid oligomers and protofibrils increase the conductivity of membranes by a non-channel mechanism. This effect is observed for all soluble oligomers tested regardless of protein sequence and is not observed for amyloid fibrils or soluble low molecular weight species, suggesting that the increase in membrane conductivity may be a primary common mechanism of amyloid oligomer pathogenesis. Peptide Synthesis—Peptide synthesis: Aβ peptides, prion 106–126, and IAPP 1The abbreviations used are: IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide; EM, electron microscopy; SEC, size exclusion chromatography. were synthesized by fluoren-9-ylmethoxy carbonyl chemistry using a continuous flow semiautomatic instrument as described previously (9Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity was checked by analytical reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography and by electrospray mass spectrometry. Polyglutamine KKQ40KK was a gift from Dr. Ronald Wetzel, and α-synuclein was a gift from Dr. Ralf Langen. Preparation of Oligomers and Fibrils—Lyophilized peptides and proteins were resuspended in 50% acetonitrile in water and re-lyophilized. Soluble oligomers were prepared by dissolving 1.0 mg of peptide or protein in 400 μl of hexafluoroisopropanol for 10–20 min at room temperature. 100 μl of the resulting seedless solution was added to 900 μl of double distilled H2O in a siliconized Eppendorf tube. After 10–20-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant fraction (pH 2.8–3.5) was transferred to a new siliconized tube and subjected to a gentle stream of N2 for 5–10 min to evaporate the hexafluoroisopropanol. The samples were then stirred at 500 r.p.m. using a Teflon-coated micro stir bar for 24–48 h at 22 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were taken at 6–12-h intervals for observation by atomic force microscopy, electron microscopy (EM), and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The time at which the oligomers are most populated depends on several factors, such as speed of stirring and the concentration, so it is important to check their size and homogeneity with SEC. The maximum occurs between 6 h to 4 days. For prion 106–126 the samples were heated at 65 °C for 30 min, and poly(Q) was heated for 2 h at 37 °C before stirring. These conditions were empirically determined to provide homogeneous populations of oligomers. In the case of IAPP, oligomer formation should be monitored as early as possible. The purity of IAPP is important, because the presence of reduced IAPP promotes fibril formation leading to short-lived oligomers. Fibrils were prepared under three different conditions, water (pH 3.8–4.2), 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), each containing 0.02% sodium azide. The final peptide or protein concentration was 0.3–0.5 mg/ml. The samples were prepared as described above for oligomers but stirred at room temperature for 6–9 days. Fibril formation was monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence and UV light scattering. Once fibril formation was complete, the solutions were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 20 min, the fibril pellet was washed three times with the doubly distilled water and then resuspended in the desired buffer. The morphology was verified by negative stain EM. Bilayers—Bilayers were formed at room temperature by the union of two monolayers formed from a mixture (1:1 by weight) of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol as described elsewhere (10Ehring G.R. Lagos N. Zampighi G.A. Hall J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Sokolov Y. Mailliard W.S. Tranngo N. Isas M. Luecke H. Haigler H.T. Hall J.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The lipid acyl chains are all oleoyl. Briefly lipid monolayers were opposed over a hole ∼200 μm in diameter in a 15-micron-thick Teflon partition dividing the two aqueous phases. The hole, punched by electric spark, was precoated with a 2.5% solution of squalane in n-pentane. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL. Salt solutions contained various concentrations NaCl buffered by 10 mm HEPES-Tris to pH 7.4. Solutions were stirred continuously with magnetic stirring bars, except that stirring was occasionally interrupted to record an I-V curve if stirring-induced noise was too objectionable. Bilayer formation was monitored by measuring capacitance. Silver/silver chloride wires were used as electrodes to apply voltages and record currents across the bilayer. The rear-chamber potential was taken as ground, and the additions were made to the front chamber. For measurements of membrane conductance a ramp protocol (–150 to +150 mV, 60 mV/s) was used. Voltages were generated and currents digitized at resolution of 12 bits by an AD Laboratory ADC/DAC board running software written in the laboratory. Currents were transduced by an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA.) connected to the AD Laboratory board as described above. The ion selectivity was determined by measuring the reversal potential in asymmetrical ionic conditions. Electron Microscopy—For electron microscopy, 2 μl of the sample were adsorbed onto 200-mesh carbon and formvar-coated grids, airdried, and washed for 1 min in distilled water. The samples were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) for 2 min and viewed with a Zeiss 10CR microscope (80 kV). Thioflavin T Fluorescence—Thioflavin T fluorescence was determined as described (12Levine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission spectrum was measured using a Spex Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorometer Size Exclusion Chromatography—SEC was performed using a Hewlett Packard 1050 liquid chromatograph and a 0.78 × 30 cm Toso Haas G3000SWxl column in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at a flow of 0.4 ml/min. The eluate was monitored by UV absorbance at 230 nm. Investigating the conformational basis of soluble amyloid oligomer toxicity requires the preparation homogenous and relatively stable populations of conformationally distinct soluble monomers, oligomeric intermediates and fibrils. Homogeneous samples of low molecular weight species (monomer or dimer), spherical oligomers, and fibrils were prepared from Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Alzheimer disease) α-synuclein (Parkinson disease), IAPP (Type II diabetes), polyglutamine (KKQ40KK) (Huntington disease), and prion (106–126) H1 (Prion diseases), using the procedures we have described previously (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Although the conditions that promote the formation of spherical oligomers are remarkably similar for the different proteins and peptides, the conditions were optimized for each peptide or protein to obtain the most homogenous samples possible (see “Materials and Methods”). All preparations were visualized by electron microscopy (Fig. 1A). The soluble oligomer samples contain a homogeneous population of spherical particles with an average diameter of 3–5 nm and are free of detectable mature amyloid fibrils. The fibrillar samples contain predominately long mature amyloid fibrils with very few, if any, spherical oligomers. The homogeneity was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1B). Oligomeric Aβ42 elutes as a symmetrical peak of ∼90–110 kDa and contains less than 10% low molecular weight monomer or dimeric species. The soluble low molecular weight samples contain a peak that elutes at the position expected for monomer or dimer and contains less than 1% of high molecular weight species (13Garzon-Rodriguez W. Sepulveda-Becerra M. Milton S. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21037-21044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of these relatively homogeneous samples on membrane conductivity using planar lipid bilayers (10Ehring G.R. Lagos N. Zampighi G.A. Hall J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Spherical Aβ42 oligomers specifically increase the conductance of the bilayer (Fig. 2A). The increase in conductivity is approximately proportional to the concentration of oligomers. No increase in conductance was observed for low molecular weight Aβ species (monomer or dimer) (Fig. 2B) or fibrils (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the prior addition of soluble low molecular weight Aβ or Aβ fibrils does not prevent the conductivity increase caused by the subsequent addition of spherical Aβ oligomers (Fig. 2, B and C). Aβ40 spherical oligomers also exhibited the same conductivity increase when added to lipid bilayers (supplementary Fig. 1). The increase in membrane conductance in response to oligomer addition occurs in the absence of any evidence of discrete ion channel or pore formation (Fig. 3A). The high sensitivity recording indicates that there is little change in the noise level in the current trace as the current increases from 0 to ∼100 pA after oligomer addition. Previous studies of the interaction of Aβ with membranes suggested that Aβ forms pores or channels in membranes (8Kagan B.L. Hirakura Y. Azimov R. Azimova R. Lin M.C. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10573-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 15Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The increase in conductivity reported here is unique and distinct from previous reports of pore or channel formation by Aβ. In particular, we do not find discrete unitary conductance changes or evidence of open and closed states that are characteristic of ion channels. The conductance induced by soluble oligomers is not inhibited by Tris ions or Congo red that have been reported to inhibit Aβ channels (15Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 16Hirakura Y. Lin M.C. Kagan B.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We examined the ion selectivity by measuring the bionic reversal potential. The observed reversal potentials are zero, indicating that the conductance is not ion selective (Fig. 3B). The conductance we observe for soluble Aβ oligomers is ∼100-fold greater than previously reported for similar concentrations of Aβ that were not conformationally characterized (14Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10573-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 15Arispe N. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Rather than forming pores or channels, soluble oligomers appear to enhance the ability of ions to move through the lipid bilayer on their own. Although the explanation for these differences is not entirely clear, the conditions used in the previous reports of amyloid Aβ ion channels seem unlikely to include significant amounts of soluble amyloid oligomers. Since preincubation of soluble oligomers with oligomer-specific antibody inhibits the toxicity of all types of soluble oligomers in cell culture (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of this anti-oligomer antibody on membrane conductance. The increase in conductivity caused by Aβ spherical oligmers is rapidly reversed (Fig. 3C) upon the addition of a conformation-dependent antibody that is specific for amyloid oligomers (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar) but is not reversed by nonspecific control antibodies (data not shown). The fact that anti-oligomer antibody can reverse the conductivity increase suggests the oligomeric Aβ does not undergo a conformation change to a form that is not recognized by the antibody upon membrane interaction and that the oligomers are only peripherally associated with the bilayer rather than stably inserted into the hydrocarbon core. Anti-oligomer antibody appears to remove Aβ from its association with the membrane, because the infrared amide I signal at 1627 cm–1 that is specific for membrane-associated Aβ drops precipitously after anti-oligomer antibody addition. 2P. Axelsen, personal communication. Since other amyloidogenic proteins also form spherical oligomers that have a common conformation-dependent structure and are also cytotoxic (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar), we tested whether they have similar effects on membrane conductivity. Spherical oligomers from α-synuclein, IAPP, poly(Q), and prion 106–126 also specifically increase bilayer conductivity in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 4, A–D). As observed for Aβ, low molecular weight species and fibrils from these amyloid-forming proteins and peptides have no effect on membrane conductivity when tested at concentrations up to 8 μm (supplementary Fig. 2). The increase in conductivity caused by α-synuclein, IAPP, poly(Q), and prion 106–126 oligomers was also reversed by addition of anti-oligomer antibody (supplementary Fig. 3). Preincubation of soluble oligomers with anti-oligomer antibody also prevents the increase in membrane conductance when they are applied to lipid bilayers (data not shown). Using homogeneous populations of low molecular weight species, spherical oligomers, and fibrils, we found that all types of spherical oligomers examined specifically induce dramatic increases in the conductivity of membranes. Since the monomeric or low molecular weight species and amyloid fibrils do not induce a conductivity change, this effect is specific for the particular conformation associated with spherical oligomers. We have recently shown that the soluble oligomers share a common structure that is associated with cellular toxicity, suggesting that soluble oligomers share a common primary mechanism of pathogenesis (6Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). This predicts that oligomers would also share a common target, and since some types of amyloid oligomers are cytosolic, while others are extracellular, the common target must be accessible to both the cytosolic and extracellular compartments. The plasma membrane of the cell is one of the few targets that is accessible to both compartments. We demonstrate that the increase in membrane conductivity induced by spherical oligomers is also a common property shared by all oligomers tested. This suggests that the increase in membrane permeability caused by spherical oligomers may represent the common primary mechanism of pathogenesis. The different effects of low molecular weight Aβ and oligomeric Aβ in increasing membrane conductance is correlated with the different effects on membrane structure that have been reported as determined by small angle x-ray diffraction (17Mason R.P. Jacob R.F. Walter M.F. Mason P.E. Avdulov N.A. Chochina S.V. Igbavboa U. Wood W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18801-18807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Monomeric or low molecular weight Aβ produced a broad increase in electron density in the center of the bilayer accompanied by a reduction in the width of the bilayer from 51 to 46 Å. In contrast, oligomeric, aggregated Aβ induces a marked decrease in electron density throughout the membrane due to an increased molecular volume of the lipid acyl chains. The decreased density of the hydrocarbon core could explain the increased conductivity of the membrane that we observed upon oligomer addition. The increase in membrane conductivity could lead to depolarization of the plasma membrane, which would be detrimental to the function of cells and especially so for neuronal function. The membrane conductance increase we report here can also account for a wide range of effects that have been reported for Aβ, such as defects of cytosolic ion homeostasis and signaling as a direct consequence of the membrane conductance increase (18Mattson M.P. Barger S.W. Cheng B. Lieberburg I. Smith-Swintosky V.L. Rydel R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that spherical amyloid oligomers or protofibrils are responsible for a generalized increase in membrane conductance, and this may represent the common mechanism of pathogenesis for amyloid-related degenerative diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1988492454,"Acetylation of histones and non-histone proteins is an important post-translational modification involved in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes and all viral DNA that integrates into the human genome (e.g. the human immunodeficiency virus). Dysfunction of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) is often associated with the manifestation of several diseases. In this respect, HATs are the new potential targets for the design of therapeutics. In this study, we report that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a major curcumanoid in the spice turmeric, is a specific inhibitor of the p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) HAT activity but not of p300/CBP-associated factor, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, curcumin could also inhibit the p300-mediated acetylation of p53 in vivo. It specifically represses the p300/CBP HAT activity-dependent transcriptional activation from chromatin but not a DNA template. It is significant that curcumin could inhibit the acetylation of HIV-Tat protein in vitro by p300 as well as proliferation of the virus, as revealed by the repression in syncytia formation upon curcumin treatment in SupT1 cells.

The eukaryotic genome is packaged into a highly complex nucleoprotein structure, chromatin. Although apparently repressive, a precise organization of chromatin is essential for replication, repair, recombination, and chromosomal segregation. Alteration in chromatin organization modulates the expression of underlying genes, which also includes the genes of integrated viral genomes (1Quivy V. Van Lint C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These dynamic changes in the chromatin structure are brought about by post-translational modifications of the amino-terminal tails of the histones and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling (2Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 76: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Specific amino acids within the histone tail are the sites of a variety of modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation. Among these, acetylation of histones and nonhistone proteins plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression. A balance between acetylation and deacetylation states of these proteins forms the basis of the regulation of transcription. Dysfunction of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases is often associated with the manifestation of several diseases, including cancer, cardiac hypertrophy, and asthma (3McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 206-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Yang X.J.

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; HDAC, histone deacetylase; CTPB, N-(4-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-2-ethoxy-6-pentadecyl-benzamide; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus. modulate gene expression by catalyzing targeted acetylation of the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues on histones and nonhistone proteins. HATs can be classified into several families based on the number of highly conserved structural motifs. These include the GNAT family (Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase; e.g. Gcn5, PCAF), the MYST (MOZ, YBF2/SAS3, and TIP60) group, and the p300/CBP family (4Yang X.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 959-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 6Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). The p300 and CBP are ubiquitously expressed global transcriptional coactivators that have critical roles in a wide variety of cellular phenomena including cell cycle control, differentiation, and apoptosis (7Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 8Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The transcriptional coactivator function of these two proteins is partially facilitated by their intrinsic HAT activity (9Kundu T.K. Palhan V.B. Wang Z. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Significantly, p300/CBP also acetylates several nonhistone proteins with functional consequences. The most notable example is the acetylation of p53. p300/CBP directly interacts with p53 and acetylates the tumor suppressor in vivo and in vitro to enhance its transcriptional activation ability (4Yang X.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 959-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 10Brooks C.L. Gu W Curr. Opin.

Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). Analysis of colorectal, gastric, and epithelial cancer samples show that in several instances, there is a mis-sense mutation as well as deletion mutations in the p300 gene (12Muraoka M. Konishi M. Kikuchi-Yanoshita R. Tanaka K. Shitara N. Chong J.M. Iwama T. Miyaki M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1565-1569PubMed Google Scholar). 80% of glioblastoma cases have been associated with the loss of heterozygosity of the p300 gene (13Phillips A. Vousden K.H. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In acute myeloid leukemia, the gene for CBP is translocated and fused to either the monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ) gene or to MLL (a homeotic regulator, mixed lineage leukemia). In both cases, the HAT activity of CBP remains intact. However, the fusion proteins cause aberrant gene expression through improper targeting of the genes. Retention of partial HAT function by the fusion protein may result in the altered regulation of the target gene, whereas a loss of function of the fusion protein may result in the normal gene not being transcribed at all. In either case, this results in aberrant cell cycle regulation, leading to cancer (4Yang X.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 959-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Mutations in HATs cause several other disorders apart from cancer. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome has been found to be a result of mutations in CBP. A single mutation at the PHD-type zinc finger in the HAT domain of CBP, resulting in an alteration of a conserved amino acid (E1278K), causes this syndrome. It is interesting that this mutation in CBP also abolishes its HAT activity (14Murata T. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Tatsumi K. Ishii M. Taki T. Masuno M. Ohashi H. Yanagisawa M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K.

The degradation of p300/CBP is also found to be associated with certain neurodegenerative diseases (16Rouaux C. Lokic N. Mbedi Boutiller S. Leoffler J.P. Boutiller A.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6537-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Though the role of HAT activity in cardiac hypertrophy is still speculative, overexpression of p300 is sufficient to induce hypertrophy. The HAT domain of p300 was found to be essential for the stimulation of hypertrophy (17Gusterson R.J. Jazrawi E. Adcock I.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6838-6847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Hyperacetylation of histones was also observed in the lung cells under asthmatic conditions (17Gusterson R.J. Jazrawi E. Adcock I.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6838-6847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Chromatin analysis of the HIV genome shows that a single nucleosome (nuc-1) located at the transcription start site is specifically disrupted during transcriptional activation. Treatment of the cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 with histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g. trichostatin A/trapoxin/valproic acid) causes a global acetylation of the cellular histones. Therefore, this treatment also results in the transcriptional activation of the HIV promoter and a robust increase in virus production (18Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 19Quivy V. Adam E. Collette Y. Demonte D. Chariot A. Vanhulle C. Berkhout B. Castellano R. de Launoit Y. Burny A. Piette J.

Furthermore, recruitment of HDAC1 near nuc-1 by host factors YY1 and LSF to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat have been shown to inhibit transcription by maintaining nuc-1 in the hypoacetylated state (20Coull J.J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2965-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data establish the fact that histone acetylation of nuc-1 is at least partly essential for the multiplication of HIV-1. Acetylation of the HIV-1 transactivator Tat by p300, PCAF, and human GCN5 has also been demonstrated to be important for HIV transcriptional activity (22Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E.

Significant progress has been made in the field of histone deacetylase inhibitors as antineoplastic drugs and also against cardiac hypertrophy. However, very few inhibitors of histone acetyltransferases are known so far. Availability of recombinant HATs made it possible to synthesize and test more target-specific inhibitors, Lys-CoA for p300 and H3-CoA-20 for PCAF (26Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Ait-Si-Ali S.

Although it has been extensively employed for in vitro transcription studies, cells are not permeable to Lys-CoA (27Cebrat M. Kim C.M. Thompson P.R. Daugherty M. Cole P.A. Bioorg Med. Chem. 2003; 11: 3307-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, we have isolated the first naturally occurring HAT inhibitor, anacardic acid, from cashew nut shell liquid and garcinol from Garcinia indica, which are nonspecific inhibitors of p300/CBP and PCAF but are capable of easily permeating the cells in culture (28Balasubramanyam K.

Different chemical modifications of these inhibitors were attempted to identify enzyme-specific inhibitors, but it serendipitously led to the synthesis of the only known p300-specific activator, N-(4-chloro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2-ethoxy-6-pentadecyl-benzamide. Herein, we describe the discovery of curcumin as the first p300/CBP-specific cell permeable HAT inhibitor. We have shown that it does not affect the HAT activity of PCAF or histone deacetylase and methyltransferase activities. However, p300 HAT activity-dependent chromatin transcription was efficiently repressed by curcumin but not transcription from DNA template. It could also inhibit the acetylation of histones in vivo. Significantly, curcumin repressed the multiplication of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1) and also inhibited the acetylation of HIV-Tat protein. Purification and Structural Analysis of Curcumin—Curcumin was purified from Curcuma longa rhizome extract as described previously (29Balasubramanyam K. Altaf M. Varier R.A. Swaminathan V. Ravindran A. Sadhale P.P. Kundu T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33716-33726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The purity and identity of the compound was determined by mass spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy. The purified compound was stored at room temperature and dissolved freshly in Me2SO for each use. Histone Acetyltransferase Assay—HAT assays were performed as described previously (30Kundu T.K. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1605-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 2.4 μg of highly purified HeLa core histones were incubated in HAT assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 10 mm sodium butyrate at 30 °C for 10 min with or without baculovirus-expressed recombinant p300/CBP or PCAF in the presence and absence of curcumin followed by addition of 1 μl of 4.7 Ci/mmol [3H]acetyl CoA and were further incubated for another 10 min in a 30-μl reaction. The reaction mixture was then blotted onto P-81 (Whatman) filter paper, and radioactive counts were recorded on a PerkinElmer Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter. The radiolabeled acetylated histones were visualized by resolving on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to fluorography followed by autoradiography. Histone Methyltransferase and Deacetylase Assays—Histone methyltransferase assays were performed in a 30-μl reaction. The reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris, 4 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 μl (∼8 μg of protein/μl) HeLa nuclear extract or 2 μg of bacterially expressed HMTase domain of G9a fused to GST (31Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) were incubated in the presence or absence of curcumin for 10 min at 30 °C. After the initial incubation, 1 μl of 8.3 Ci/mmol [3H](S)-adenosyl methionine was added to the reaction mixtures, and the incubation continued for 1 h (in the case of nuclear extract) or for 15 min (in the case of G9a). The reaction products were TCA-precipitated, resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to fluorography followed by autoradiography. For the deacetylation assays, histones were acetylated by the recombinant p300 (20 ng) using 2.4 μg of core histones and 1 μl of 4.7 Ci/mmol [3H]acetyl CoA in HAT assay buffer without sodium butyrate for 30 min at 30 °C (29Balasubramanyam K.

The activity of p300 was inhibited by incubating the reaction mixture with a 5 μm concentration of the p300-specific inhibitor lysyl-CoA (20Coull J.J. He G. Melander C. Rucker V.C. Dervan P.B. Margolis D.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12349-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) for 15 min at 30 °C, after which 50 ng of baculovirus-expressed recombinant HDAC1 was added in the presence or absence of curcumin and incubated further for 45 min at 30 °C. The samples were processed as described above. In Vitro Chromatin Assembly—Chromatin template for in vitro transcription experiments was assembled and characterized as described earlier (9Kundu T.K. Palhan V.B. Wang Z. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription Assay—Transcription assays were carried out as described elsewhere (9Kundu T.K. Palhan V.B. Wang Z. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with the necessary modifications. The schematic representation of the in vitro transcription protocol is given in Fig. 4A. The reconstituted chromatin template (containing 30 ng of DNA) or an equimolar amount of histone-free DNA was incubated with 50 ng of activator (Gal4-VP16) in a buffer containing 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2% glycerol. Baculovirus-expressed recombinant full-length p300 was preincubated with indicated amounts of curcumin at 20 °C for 20 min, after which it was added to the transcription reaction, and the acetylation reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. HeLa nuclear extract (5 μl, which contains 8 mg/ml protein) was added then to initiate the preinitiation complex formation. Transcription reaction was started by the addition of NTP-mix and [α-32P]UTP after the preinitiation complex formation and incubated for 40 min further at 30 °C. For loading control, a separate reaction was set up with ∼25 ng of supercoiled ML200 DNA, and the transcription assay was carried out as described above, without the addition of the activator (Gal4-VP16), and 2 μl of this reaction was added to each of the transcription reactions. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 250 μl of stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 0.025 ng/μl tRNA). Transcripts were analyzed by 5% Urea-PAGE, and quantification of transcription was done with the use of the Fujix Bioimaging Analyzer. To visualize the transcripts, the gels were exposed on x-ray film. Acetic Acid/Urea/Triton X-100 (AUT) Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting for in Vivo-Acetylated Histones—HeLa cells (3 × 106 cells per 90-mm dish) were seeded overnight, and histones were extracted from 24 h of compound treated cells as reported previously (29Balasubramanyam K.

In brief, cells were harvested, washed in ice-cold buffer A (150 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm MgCl2) and lysed in buffer A containing 250 mm sucrose and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation and washed, and proteins were extracted for 1 h using 0.25 m HCl. The proteins were precipitated with 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and sequentially washed with ice-cold acidified acetone (20 μl of 12 n HCl in 100 ml of acetone) and acetone, air-dried, and dissolved in the sample buffer (5.8 m urea, 0.9 m glacial acetic acid, 16% glycerol, and 4.8% 2-mercaptoethanol). The histones (equal amounts in all lanes) were resolved on AUT gel as described elsewhere (33Ryan C.A. Annunziato A.T. Canada V. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

For Western blotting, the quantitated protein samples were run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; after electrophoresis, proteins on the gel were electrotransferred onto an Immobilon membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk solution in 1× PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then immunoblotted with anti-acetyl H3 (Calbiochem), anti-acetyl H4 (a kind gift from Dr. Alaine Verrault), or anti-H3. Detection was performed using goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bangalore Genei), and bands were visualized with the use of the ECL detection system (Pierce). Apoptosis Assay—Curcumin-induced apoptosis was monitored by the extent of nuclear fragmentation. Nuclear fragmentation was visualized by Hoechst staining of apoptotic nuclei. The apoptotic cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the cells were washed and resuspended in 20 μl of PBS before deposition on polylysine-coated coverslips and were left to adhere on cover slips for 30 min at room temperature, after which the cover slips were washed twice with PBS. The adhered cells were then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature and rinsed three times with PBS. The coverslips were treated with Hoechst 33258 for 30 min at 37 °C, rinsed with PBS, mounted on slides with glycerol-PBS, and processed as described previously (29Balasubramanyam K. Altaf M.

Transient Transfection and Immunoprecipitation—293 T cells were transfected with CMV-p53 and CMV-p300 using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was replaced, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h with curcumin (100 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO). The cells were harvested using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin), and the p53 protein was immunoprecipitated from the lysates using mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody, DO1 (oncogene). The immunocomplexes were bound on protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h at 4 °C, washed three times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel followed by Western blotting using mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody, pAb421, or mouse monoclonal anti-acetylated lysine antibody. Syncytium Inhibition Assay—The cell lines SupT1 and H9/HTLV-IIIb NIH 1983 were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. H9/HTLV-IIIb NIH 1983 cells carrying a stably integrated provirus were cocultured with excess numbers of SupT1 cells at a ratio of 1:200 or 1:400. A total of 1 × 106 cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate and cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Curcumin in Me2SO was added to the cells to the final concentration as shown, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C. All the wells received the same amount of Me2SO, including the control wells. Formation of syncytia was visible under light microscope within 12 h. The total number of syncytia in 10 representative wells was counted at different time points (12, 24, and 48 h); data for the 12-h time point are presented. Identical results were obtained at other time points. All the assays were performed in triplicate wells, and the experiment was performed two times. Screening of plant extracts known to possess anticancer properties led us to a polyphenolic compound from Curcuma longa rhizome, which is a potent and specific inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP but not of PCAF. By employing mass spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy, it was identified as curcumin. As can be seen from both the filter binding (Fig. 1A) and gel (Fig. 1, B–D) HAT assays, the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 by p300/CBP was strongly inhibited by curcumin (Fig. 1, A–C, lanes 5–7), with an IC50 of ∼25 μm, whereas the PCAF HAT activity showed no change even in the presence of 100 μm curcumin (Fig. 1, A and D). These data establish curcumin as the first known p300/CBP-specific natural HAT inhibitor. To ensure absolute enzyme specificity, we went on to check the effect of curcumin on HDAC1 and histone methyltransferase activities. Deacetylation of acetylated core histones by recombinant baculovirus-expressed histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) was not effected by the presence of curcumin (Fig. 2,A, lane 3 versus lanes 7 and 8, and B, lane 2 versus lanes 4 and 5). We have also investigated the effect of curcumin on histone methyltransferase activity. HeLa core histones were methylated with [3H](S)-adenosyl methionine by recombinant lysine methyltransferase G9a, which specifically methylates lysine residues 9 and 27 of histone H3 (31Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of curcumin. As depicted in Fig. 2C, histone methylation by G9a remains the same in the presence or absence of curcumin (Fig. 2C, lane 3 versus lanes 4–6). Furthermore, to find out whether curcumin had any effect on other histone methyltransferases, we have performed HMTase assay using HeLa nuclear extract as a source of other histone methyltransferase enzymes. Similar to G9a-mediated methylation of core histones, methylation by nuclear extract showed no difference whatsoever in the presence or absence of curcumin (Fig. 2D, lane 3 versus lanes 4–6). Taken together these results suggest that curcumin is absolutely specific for the histone acetyltransferase activity (of p300/CBP) but not other enzymes for which histones are the substrate. It also indicates that curcumin presumably binds to the enzyme rather than the substrate histones. We went on to characterize the nature of inhibition of curcumin on the p300 HAT activity. Enzyme kinetics was studied to understand the mechanism of curcumin-mediated inhibition of p300 HAT activity by changing both acetyl CoA (Fig. 3A) and histone concentrations (Fig 3B) keeping the other constant at a time. In both cases, Km, Vmax, and Kcat decreased, indicating that curcumin binds not to the active sites of either histone or acetyl CoA but to some other site on the enzyme. Presumably, this binding site on p300/CBP is specific for curcumin, and binding leads to a conformational change, resulting in a decrease in the binding efficiency of both histones and acetyl CoA to p300. In this connection, curcumin behaves in a unique manner compared with another polyphenolic cell-permeable HAT inhibitor, garcinol, in which case, upon changing the concentration of acetyl CoA, the inhibitor acts as an uncompetitive type but as a competitive inhibitor for core histones (29Balasubramanyam K. Altaf M. Varier R.A. Swaminathan V. Ravindran A. Sadhale P.P. Kundu T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33716-33726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of curcumin on transcription, in vitro transcription experiments were performed using DNA and reconstituted chromatin template. Transcription from the DNA template was not affected by curcumin even at 300 μm (Fig. 4B, lane 3 versus lanes 4-7). Significantly, increasing concentrations of curcumin repressed p300 HAT activity-dependent chromatin transcription up to 3-fold at 100 μm and up to 8-fold at 300 μm. (Fig. 4C, lane 4 versus lanes 7 and 9). Taken together, these data suggest that curcumin is a potent and specific inhibitor of p300 HAT activity in the transcriptional context. Curcumin permeates the cell, and it is known to have a role in cancer chemoprevention and also in tumor growth suppression (35Lin J.K. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Proc. Natl. Sci. Counc. ROC (B). 2001; 25: 59-66PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of tumor cells to curcumin in vitro results in the inhibition of cell proliferation and also induction of apoptosis (36Pan M.H. Chang W.L. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Ho C.T. Lin J.K. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 1464-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous reports on other cell lines, treatment of HeLa cells with curcumin induces apoptosis (Fig. 5A, after a 24-h exposure to 75–100 μm of the compound).

Oligonucleotide arrays hybridized with RNA made from livers of transgenic SREBP-1a, transgenic SREBP-2, and SREBP cleavage-activating protein knockout mice recently identified 33 genes regulated by SREBPs in liver, four of which had no known connection to lipid metabolism. One of the four genes was PCSK9, which encodes proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9a, a protein that belongs to the proteinase K subfamily of subtilases. Mutations in PCSK9 are associated with an autosomal dominant form of hypercholesterolemia. Here, we demonstrate that hepatic overexpression of either wild-type or mutant PCSK9 in mice results in hypercholesterolemia. The hypercholesterolemia is due to a post-transcriptional event causing a reduction in low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor protein prior to the internalization and recycling of the receptor. Overexpression of PCSK9 in primary hepatocytes and in mice lacking the LDL receptor does not alter apolipoprotein B secretion. These data are consistent with PCSK9 affecting plasma LDL cholesterol levels by altering LDL receptor protein levels via a post-transcriptional mechanism.

Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 5Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). SREBPs also are the principal transcriptional regulators of the LDL receptor gene, which clears apoB-containing lipoproteins, such as VLDL and LDL, from the plasma (5Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar).To identify genes regulated by SREBPs, we used oligonucleotide arrays hybridized with RNA from livers of mice that overexpressed SREBPs (transgenic for SREBP-1a or transgenic for SREBP-2) and that lacked all SREBPs as a result of deleting SCAP, an escort protein required for SREBP activation (5Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). With this physiologic filter, 33 genes were identified that were increased in the transgenic livers and decreased in the SCAP-deficient livers. Four of these 33 genes had no known function. One of these four genes was Pcsk9, which encodes the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9a, also designated NARC-1 (neural apoptosis-regulated convertase 1). Seidah et al. (6Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Marcinkiewicz J. Jasmin S.B. Stifani S. Basak A. Prat A. Chretien M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) showed that PCSK9 belongs to the proteinase K subfamily of subtilases. PCSK9 is synthesized first as a soluble zymogen that undergoes autocatalytic intramolecular processing in the ER to produce a prosegment that remains associated with the secreted enzyme.A link between PCSK9 and cholesterol metabolism was established by Abifadel et al. (7Abifadel M. Varret M. Rabès J.-P. Ouguerram K. Devillers M. Cruaud C. Benjannet S. Wickham L. Erlich D. Villéger L. Farnier M. Beucler I. Bruckert E. Chambaz J. Chanu B. Lecerf J.-M. Luc G.

Genet. 2003; 34: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar), who showed that two missense mutations in PCSK9 were associated with an autosomal dominant form of hypercholesterolemia. The first mutation results in the substitution of an arginine for serine (S127R) in a conserved residue located between the primary and secondary zymogen processing sites. The second missense mutation (F216L), also in a conserved amino acid, is in the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Subsequently, two additional missense mutations in the catalytic domain of PCSK9 (D374Y and N157K) were shown to segregate in families with elevated plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations (8Leren T.P. Clin. Genet. 2004; 65: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Timms K.M. Wagner S. Samuels M.E. Forbey K. Goldfine H. Jammulapati S. Skolnick M.H. Hopkins P.N. Hunt S.C. Shattuck D.M. Hum. Genet. 2004; 114: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).The clinical phenotype of subjects with these missense mutations in PCSK9 is indistinguishable from two other autosomal dominant forms of hypercholesterolemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, which is caused by mutations in the LDLR and familial defective apoB, due to mutations that interfere with LDL binding to the LDLR and clearance from the plasma (10Rader D.J. Cohen J. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that mutations in PCSK9 cause hypercholesterolemia by altering SREBP expression, apoB synthesis/secretion, and/or LDLR expression. To distinguish between these mechanisms, a series of in vitro and in vivo studies with wild-type and mutant PCSK9 was performed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral Methods and Supplies—DNA manipulations were performed using standard molecular biology techniques (11Sambrook J.

Immunoblot analyses were performed using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate System from Pierce.Construction of Wild-type and Mutant PCSK9 Expression Vectors—An expression vector that encodes amino acids 1–692 of human PCSK9 followed by a FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) under the control of the CMV promoter-enhancer (pCMV-PCSK9-FLAG) was constructed as follows. The human PCSK9 cDNA was amplified using nested PCR. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA prepared from cultured HepG2 cells (ATCC number HB-8065) using methods described previously (24Moon Y.-A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7335-7343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The following primers were then used for the amplification of the PCSK9 cDNA: 5′ primer (5′-GCAACCTCTCCCCTGGCCCTCATG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-GCTTCCTGGCACCTCCACCTGGGG-3′) for the primary amplification and 5′ primer (5′-CCAGTGTGCTGGAATTCGCCACCATGGGCACCGTCAGCTCCAGG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CCCCTCGAGTCACTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCTGGAG CTCCTGGGAGGCCTGCGCCAG-3′) for the secondary amplification. The 5′ primer sequence for the secondary amplification contained an EcoRI restriction site, a Kozak sequence, and the sequence encoding amino acids 1–7 of human PCSK9. The sequence of 3′ primer used for the secondary amplification consisted of nucleotides that encode amino acids 684–692 of human PCSK9, a FLAG epitope tag, two copies of a stop codon with an intervening G nucleotide, and an XhoI restriction site. The PCR-amplified cDNA for human PCSK9 was digested with EcoRI and XhoI prior to ligation into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).To generate plasmids expressing mutant forms of human PCSK9, the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to change the nucleotide sequences of pCMV-PCSK9-FLAG using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CTTCCTGGTGAAGATGAGAGGCGACCTGCTGGAGCTG-3′ for the S127R plasmid (pCMV-S127R), 5′-GAGGAGGACGGGACCCGCCTCCACAGACAGGCCAGCA-3′ for the F216L plasmid (pCMV-F216L), and 5′-ACAGAGTGGGACAGCCCAGGCTGCTGCCC-3′ for the S386A plasmid (pCMV-S386A). The integrity of expression plasmid sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Cultured Cell Experiments—Cells were cultured in one of the following media. Medium A contained a 1:1 mixture (v/v) of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Medium B contained medium A supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 5 μg/ml cholesterol, 1 mm sodium mevalonate, and 20 μm sodium oleate. Medium C contained medium A supplemented with 5% (v/v) NCLPDS, 50 μm sodium compactin, and 50 μm sodium mevalonate.SRD-12B cells that harbor a genetic deletion of S1P (25Rawson R.B. Cheng D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28261-28269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were set up at 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in medium B on day 0. On day 1, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids (2 μg of DNA/dish) using 6 μlof Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) as described (26Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). On day 2, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for 1 h in medium C containing 1% (w/v) hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in medium C in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 μg/ml cholesterol added in a final concentration of 0.2% ethanol. After a 4-h incubation, N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal (25 μg/ml) was added for 1 h, after which the cells were harvested and processed as described (27DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).HepG2 cells (ATCC number HB-8065) were set up at 5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in DMEM containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (medium D) supplemented with 10% FCS on day 0. On day 1, cells were infected with the indicated adenovirus described below in 1 ml of medium D. After a 2-h incubation, 1 ml of medium D supplemented with 20% NCLPDS was added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After an overnight incubation, the cells were harvested and processed as described above.Stable Transfection of Chinese Hamster Ovarian (CHO-K1) Cells— On day 0, CHO-K1 cells (ATCC number CCL-61) were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/100-mm dish in medium A supplemented with 5% (v/v) FCS. On day 1, cells were transfected with 5 μg of pCMV-PCSK9-FLAG, pCMV-S127R, or pCMV-F216L per dish using the Fugene 6 reagent in a final volume of 0.2 ml. To generate control stable cell lines, 1 μg of pcDNA3 was used to transfect CHO-K1 cells. On day 2, the medium was changed to medium A containing 700 μg/ml G418 supplemented with 5% FCS. The medium was changed daily for 12 days until individual colonies were visible. Single-cell clones that stably expressed wild-type or mutant PCSK9 protein were isolated by limiting dilution and screened for PCSK9 expression by immunoblotting using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Cell lines expressing equivalent levels of wild-type and mutant forms of PCSK9 were selected for further studies and maintained in medium A containing 500 μg of G418 supplemented with 5% FCS.Construction of Adenoviral Vectors Expressing Wild-type or Mutant PCSK9 Proteins—Adenoviruses that express wild-type, S127R, F216L, or S386A forms of human PCSK9 were constructed using AdEasy system (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HindIII-XbaI fragments of pCMV-PCSK91-FLAG, pCMV-S127R, pCMV-F216L, and pCMV-S386A were ligated to a HindIII-XbaI-digested pShuttle-CMV vector. The resulting pShuttle constructs were co-transformed with the pAdEasy-1 vector into BJ5183 cells to produce recombinant adenoviral genomic constructs for wild-type and mutant PCSK9 proteins. The recombinant adenoviral genomic constructs were linearized with PacI and transfected into QBI-293A cells (Qbiogene) cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS. Cells were overlaid with 1.25% agarose/DMEM 20 h after transfection and further cultured for 14 days until discrete plaques were identified. The resulting viral plaques were assayed for PCSK9 expression by immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma).Viruses expressing wild-type or mutant human PCSK9 proteins were subjected to four rounds of amplification before purification by CsCl-ultracentrifugation (28Green M. Wold W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All viruses were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 4% sucrose buffer (29Nyberg-Hoffman C. Aguilar-Cordova E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C. Virus titers were determined using a plaque-forming unit (PFU) assay in QBI-293A cells (28Green M. Wold W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For administration to mice, the indicated amounts of each recombinant adenovirus were injected as a single dose into tail veins of nonfasted mice. Three days after injection, mice were killed, and plasma and livers were harvested. Membrane fraction and nuclear extract from liver were prepared as described (30Engelking L.J. Kuriyama H. Hammer R.E. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Liang G. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using an RNA STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). DNase I treatment of total RNA was performed using a DNA-free kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of DNase-treated total RNA using a TaqMan reverse transcription reagent kit and random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Specific primers for each gene were designed using PRIMER EXPRESS software (Applied Biosystems) and previously published (31Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The real time reverse transcription-PCR contained 20 ng of reverse-transcribed total RNA, a 167 nm concentration of the forward and reverse primers, and 10 μlof2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix in a final volume of 20 μl. The PCRs were carried out using the Applied Biosystems Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System. All reactions were done in triplicate, and the relative amounts of all mRNAs were calculated by using the comparative CT method (46, Applied Biosystems (2001) User Bulletin 2, Foster City, CAGoogle Scholar). Cyclophilin mRNA was used as the invariant control.Mice and Diets—Studies using wild-type mice were performed in 10–12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice with the genetic deletion of ARH (Arh-/-) (21Jones C. Hammer R.E. Li W.-P. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29024-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Drs. Joachim Herz and Helen Hobbs (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Knockout mice that lack the LDLR were previously described (32Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). All mice were maintained on 12-h dark/12-h light cycles and fed a chow diet that contained 4% (w/w) animal fat and <0.04% (w/w) cholesterol (Teklad 4% mouse/rat diet 7001 from Harlan Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets, Madison, WI).ApoB Synthesis and Secretion in Mouse Primary Hepatocytes— C57BL/6J male mice (8–10 weeks of age) were injected with the indicated adenovirus, and 3 days later primary hepatocytes were isolated as described previously (33Shimomura I.

The hepatocytes were allowed to attach on type I collagen-coated six-well plates for 2 h in Met/Cys-free DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 5% NCLPDS, 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (medium E). The cells were then incubated with 200 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys (Easy Tag EXPRESS-[35S] PROTEIN LABELING MIX; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 1 ml of medium E for 2 h.After incubation, the medium was collected, and protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0) were added. The cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 62.5 mm sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml ALLN, and 1 mm benzamidine.To immunoprecipitate apoB, 500 μg of cell extract or 0.5 ml of medium was incubated with 10 μg/ml of purified rabbit anti-mouse apoB antibody (provided by Dr. Helen Hobbs) in 0.5× NET (0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS). To immunoprecipitate albumin, 50 μg of cell extract protein or 50 μl of medium was incubated with 10 μg/ml of rabbit anti-mouse albumin antibody (Biodesign International, Saco, ME). After a 6-h incubation with the antibodies, 30 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. The protein-antibody-protein A/G-agarose complexes were washed five times with 500 μl of NET. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in the loading buffer (0.125 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) by boiling for 5 min and then separated on 4% SDS-PAGE gels (for apoB) or 8% gels (for albumin). The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate. The resulting signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager® Molecular Dynamics Storm 820 system (Amersham Biosciences). ApoB values were corrected for the amounts of labeled albumin synthesized and secreted from the hepatocytes. Values are reported in arbitrary units of relative counts for apoB/albumin.RESULTSTo study the mechanism by which mutations in PCSK9 cause elevated plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations, we first determined whether wild-type or mutant PSCK9 could proteolytically activate SREBPs in an aberrant fashion. SREBPs are synthesized as inactive precursors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To be active, the NH2-terminal segment of SREBP must be released from the membrane to enter the nucleus (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). SREBP activation requires SCAP, an escort protein that functions as a sterol sensor and transports SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, and two proteases, designated site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P), located in the Golgi (35Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). When ER membranes become depleted of cholesterol, SCAP escorts SREBP to the Golgi, where it undergoes two sequential proteolytic cleavage events mediated by S1P, a membrane-bound subtilase-like serine proteinase, and S2P, a membrane-bound zinc metalloproteinase. S1P belongs to the same family of subtilase-like serine proteinase as does PCSK9; therefore, mutations in PCSK9 could result in a gain of function that results in unregulated or aberrant cleavage of SREBPs, which in turn would increase lipid biosynthesis and VLDL production.To test this hypothesis, SRD-12B cells that harbor a genetic deletion of S1P and are thus incapable of cleaving SREBPs were transiently transfected with full-length SREBP-1a (Fig. 1A) or SREBP-2 (Fig. 1B) and either an empty vector, human S1P, wild-type PSCK9, or mutant PCSK9 (S127R). Cells were cultured either in the presence of sterols, conditions that normally suppress SREBP cleavage, or in the absence of sterols, conditions that induce SREBP cleavage. Cellular membranes and nuclear proteins were isolated, aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analyses were performed to determine whether wild-type or mutant PCSK9 proteolytically cleaved the membrane-bound SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 precursor proteins.As shown in Fig. 1, S1P restores normal sterol-regulated cleavage of SREBP-1a (A) and SREBP-2 (B). The transfection of wild-type PCSK9 results in equal expression of the proprotein (P) and cleaved (C) PCSK9 (compare P and C in Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 6 and 7). Transfection of the S127R mutant PCSK9 resulted in significantly less cleaved PCSK9. However, neither wild-type PCSK9 nor mutant PCSK9 restored cleavage of SREBP-1a (Fig. 1A) or SREBP-2 (Fig. 1B) in the presence or absence of sterols. These results demonstrate that mutations in PCSK9 do not increase plasma LDL cholesterol levels by bypassing the role of S1P in processing SREBPs.To determine whether wild-type and mutant PCSK9 proteins alter LDLR expression or function, wild-type CHO-K1 cell lines were stably transfected with CMV-driven wild-type PCSK9 or mutant PCSK9 cDNAs encoding either the S127R mutation or the F216L mutation. The PCSK9 proteins contained a FLAG epitope tag at the COOH terminus. Three clones with equivalent levels of PCSK9 expression were identified, and the expression and function of the LDLR were assessed. As shown in Fig. 2A, the amount of wild-type and mutant PCSK9 proteins expressed was similar in the three cell lines, although the S127R mutation resulted in a reduction in the relative proportion of cleaved PCSK9 (A, lower band). The amounts of secreted wild-type and F216L mutant were also equivalent, whereas the amount of secreted S127R appeared to be slightly lower in amount. The LDLR protein immunoblots showed two bands. The lower band represents the precursor form that is present in the ER. The upper band represents the mature receptor that has undergone O-linked glycosylation in the Golgi (36Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The amount of mature LDLR protein was unaffected by wild-type or mutant PCSK9 overexpression. The slight reduction in the amount of the precursor form of the LDLR observed in the transfected cells was not a consistent finding. In addition, assays of LDLR function that measured LDL binding and uptake were also not consistently different among the four immortalized hamster ovarian cell lines (data not shown).Fig. 2LDLR expression in CHO-K1 and HepG2 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant forms of PCSK9.A, CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3 (CHO-K1), pCMV-PCSK9 (WT-PCSK9), pCMV-S127R (S127R), or pCMV-F216L (F216L) were grown in monolayer cultures as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For immunoblot analysis, 30 μg of cell lysate protein was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, transf"
https://openalex.org/W2012792811,"Vertebrate collagen fibrils are heterotypically composed of a quantitatively major and minor fibril collagen. In non-cartilaginous tissues, type I collagen accounts for the majority of the collagen mass, and collagen type V, the functions of which are poorly understood, is a minor component. Type V collagen has been implicated in the regulation of fibril diameter, and we reported recently preliminary evidence that type V collagen is required for collagen fibril nucleation (Wenstrup, R. J., Florer, J. B., Cole, W. G., Willing, M. C., and Birk, D. E. (2004) J. Cell. Biochem. 92, 113–124). The purpose of this study was to define the roles of type V collagen in the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis and matrix assembly. Mouse embryos completely deficient in pro-α1(V) chains were created by homologous recombination. The col5a1–/– animals die in early embryogenesis, at approximately embryonic day 10. The type V collagen-deficient mice demonstrate a virtual lack of collagen fibril formation. In contrast, the col5a1+/– animals are viable. The reduced type V collagen content is associated with a 50% reduction in fibril number and dermal collagen content. In addition, relatively normal, cylindrical fibrils are assembled with a second population of large, structurally abnormal collagen fibrils. The structural properties of the abnormal matrix are decreased relative to the wild type control animals. These data indicate a central role for the evolutionary, ancient type V collagen in the regulation of fibrillogenesis. The complete dependence of fibril formation on type V collagen is indicative of the critical role of the latter in early fibril initiation. In addition, this fibril collagen is important in the determination of fibril structure and matrix organization. Vertebrate collagen fibrils are heterotypically composed of a quantitatively major and minor fibril collagen. In non-cartilaginous tissues, type I collagen accounts for the majority of the collagen mass, and collagen type V, the functions of which are poorly understood, is a minor component. Type V collagen has been implicated in the regulation of fibril diameter, and we reported recently preliminary evidence that type V collagen is required for collagen fibril nucleation (Wenstrup, R.

The complete dependence of fibril formation on type V collagen is indicative of the critical role of the latter in early fibril initiation. In addition, this fibril collagen is important in the determination of fibril structure and matrix organization. Type V collagen is a member of the fibril subclass of collagens, which have in common a triple helical domain composed of an uninterrupted series of Gly-X-Y triplets. Type V collagen is a quantitatively minor component of predominantly type I collagen fibrils in most non-cartilaginous tissues. Several isoforms of type V collagen exist, which differ in the type and ratio of constituent chains, including heterotypic molecules containing type XI collagen chains. The most abundant and widely distributed isoform is α1(V)2α2(V), which forms heterotypic fibrils with type I collagen (1Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The role of type V collagen in the organization and biological properties of collagenous extracellular matrix is poorly understood. Observations of an inverse correlation between type V collagen:type I collagen ratios and collagen fibril diameter in in vitro fibril assembly experiments (2Birk D.E. Fitch M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cell cultures (3Marchant J.K. Hahn R.A. Linsenmayer T.F. Birk D.E. J.

Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) have led to the hypothesis that type V collagen serves as a negative regulator of collagen fibril diameter (3Marchant J.K.

That function may be mediated by retention of the non-collagenous amino-terminal propeptide after type V collagen molecules are incorporated into fibrils (2Birk D.E. Fitch M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J.

This non-collagenous domain projects outward through the gap between adjacent type I collagen molecules, leaving major portions present on the fibril surface (1Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 3Marchant J.K. Hahn R.A. Linsenmayer T.F. Birk D.E. J.

Ruggiero F. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 11Adachi E. Hayashi T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1986; 14: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A novel role for type V collagen was suggested recently by the results of studies (4Wenstrup R.J. Florer J.B. Cole W.G. Willing M.C. Birk D.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) of cultured dermal fibroblasts from patients with the heritable connective tissue disorder, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The fibroblasts had mutations that caused haploinsufficiency of COL5A1, which encodes pro-α1(V) chains. In those cultures, the total incorporation of collagen into collagen fibrils of the cell layer was reduced by half and was associated with a proportional decrease in fibril number. Because type V collagen comprises less than 5% of dermal collagen, the observed decrease in total collagen fibril formation was more than 1 order of magnitude greater than the expected reduction in collagen mass caused by the loss of contribution from one COL5A1 allele. The corresponding decrease in fibril number indicated that type V collagen may control the utilization of type I collagen during collagen fibril initiation in some tissues. To further investigate the function of type V collagen in collagen fibril formation, in vivo studies were performed on mice in which col5a1 was inactivated by homologous recombination. The complete absence of a functioning col5a1 gene resulted in lethality at embryonic day 10 (E10), 1The abbreviations used are: E, embryonic day (e.g. E10); ES, embryonic stem (cell); CI, confidence interval. with evidence of cardiovascular failure at the time of fetal demise. Animals that are haploinsufficient for col5a1 manifest many of the clinical, biomechanical, morphologic, and biochemical features of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic type. Generation of col5a1-deficient Mice—A col5a1 targeting vector was generated using PCR to amplify gene-specific 5′- and 3′-targeting arms from KG-1 ES cell DNA using Herculase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR products were verified by sequence analysis. A 5′-targeting arm from a region that included part of exon 3 was designed utilizing the primers 5′-GATGAATTC AAGCTTCACGGTGGGCACAGAGACTGGATA-3′ and 5′-CAGCCGAAGCTTGGATCCTGGATGCCCTGCTCATTGTAAATG-3′. These primers include HindIII restriction sites to facilitate cloning and a BamHI restriction site that introduces a unique restriction polymorphism. A 1.8-kb targeting arm was amplified by PCR, digested with HindIII, and cloned into the HindIII site of pNTKV-KO (Stratagene). A 3′-targeting arm from a region that included part of exon 4 was designed utilizing the primers 5′-TAGCCCGAATTCTGGATGATGAAATATTTGAGGTAG-3′ and 5′-GAGTCAGAATTCGCTTGGACGGTCATTAGCCGTCAG-3′. These primers include EcoRI restriction sites (underlined). A 4.4-kb targeting arm was amplified by PCR, digested with EcoRI, and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pNTKV-KO. The col5a1 targeting vector was linearized with NotI, and 20 μg was electroporated into KG-1 ES cells using standard conditions (42Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual,3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Woodbury, NY2003Google Scholar). Positive ES cell clones were identified by Southern blot analysis using gene-specific 5′ and 3′ probes. ES cells targeted correctly were expanded and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Germ line transmission was obtained by breeding chimeric animals to either C57BL/6 or 129SVE. Wild type and recombined alleles in mouse genomic DNA were detected by PCR using the primers 5′-CTGTAGAGGTTTGATCTTAGGGCG-3′, 5′-CATCATAAACCATCTACTATCGGG-3′, and 5′-CTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGACGAGTT-3′. Measurement of Total Collagen Deposited in the Skin—Skin was harvested from 12-week-old animals. Two 4-mm punch biopsies were taken, from the right and left of midline on the lower back of each animal. Samples were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then suspended in 6 n HCl at 100 °C for 18 h for hydrolysis. Colorimetric analysis of the hydroxyproline content of each skin sample was performed after acid hydrolysis (12Berg R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 372-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The conversion ratio of 0.12:1.0 was used to convert micrograms of hydroxyproline to total collagen (12Berg R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 372-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridizations were performed as described previously (13Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Scott W.J. Mech. Dev. 1998; 74: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The sense and antisense probes extended from exon 51 to part of exon 65 of col5a1. This was accomplished either by using a PCR strategy in which the bacterial T7 promoter sequence was added to the 5′ end of the antisense sequence for the transcription of an antisense RNA probe or by subcloning into a vector with the T7 promoter for the sense probe. The primer pairs for the probes were as follows: col5a1 antisense, 5′-GGTTTCCTGGAGATCCTGGC-3′ and 5′-GATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGGCCTTCAGCATCCAC-3′; col5a1 sense, 5′-GGTTTCCTGGAGATCCTGGC-3′ and 5′-GAGGGCCTTCAGCATCCAC-3′. Analysis of Cell Culture Proteins—Embryos dissected at day 11, 12, or 14 were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, disaggregated physically into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's complete medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and cultured at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2. For analysis of procollagens and collagens, 12,000–25,000 cells/cm2 were plated in complete medium plus 0.2 m ascorbate-2-P. For Western blot analysis, pro-collagens were collected from the tissue culture medium and separated in a 5% SDS-PAGE procedure as described previously (14Wenstrup R.J. Fowlkes J.L. Witte D.P.

Polyclonal antiserum to a unique decapeptide from the NC3 domain encoded by exon 6 of col5a1 (15Takahara K. Hoffman G.G. Greenspan D.S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24727-24733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Invitrogen. The antiserum was tested against a recombinant COL5A1 expression construct (generously provided by D. S. Greenspan, University of Wisconsin) and showed no cross-reactivity to COL11A1 (data not shown). The membrane used was Zetabind™ (Cuno, Inc., Meriden, CT). After incubation with the primary antibody, the blots were treated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) and developed using reagents from Bio-Rad. To measure short term synthesis and secretion of types I and V collagen, media from cells incubated with 50 μCi of [2,3,4,5-3H]proline (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 16 h was harvested and digested with pepsin as described previously (4Wenstrup R.J. Florer J.B. Cole W.G. Willing M.C. Birk D.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Collagen chains were separated by SDS-PAGE in 5% bisacrylamide gels under non-reducing conditions as described previously (4Wenstrup R.J. Florer J.B. Cole W.G. Willing M.C. Birk D.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Bonadio J. Holbrook K.A. Gelinas R.E. Jacob J. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1734-1742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive proteins were detected by autoradiofluorography using EnHance™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as the fluorescing agent. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Mouse embryos at day 10 of development and subscapular skin from 12-week-old male mice were used in these experiments. The ectoderm and subjacent mesenchyme lateral to the neural tube were analyzed for col5a1 wild type and col5a1-deficient embryos. The subscapular dermis was analyzed for wild type and haploinsufficient postnatal animals. Tissues were prepared for transmission electron microscopy as described previously (18Birk D.E. Trelstad R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2024-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Wenstrup R.J. Florer J.B. Willing M.C. Giunta C. Steinmann B. Young F. Susic M. Cole W.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 1766-1776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thick sections (1 μm) were cut and stained with methylene blue-azure blue for light microscopy and for selecting specific regions for further analysis. Tissue samples were stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate followed by 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 3.2. Sections were examined and photographed at 75 kV using a Hitachi 7000 transmission electron microscope. The microscope was calibrated using a line grating. For measurement of collagen fibril density, the dermis was divided into four equal regions. Analysis was performed for both the superficial and deep dermis. The superficial dermis was defined as the region subjacent to the epidermis, and the deep dermis was the lower fourth. Both regions were photographed in the central portion. Micrographs were taken at a magnification of ×31,680. Calibrated micrographs from each region were chosen randomly in a masked manner from the different regions. The micrographs were digitized, and all diameters were measured within a 2.0-μm mask. The mask was placed based on fibril orientation, that is, by cross-section and absence of cells. Diameters were measured along the minor axis of cross-sections using a RM Biometrics-Bioquant Image Analysis (Memphis, TN) system. Statistical Methods—In the statistical analyses, it was assumed that the dermal fibril diameters in each measured field in a negative have a mixed distribution consisting of a dominant symmetric component contaminated with a relatively small percentage of outliers. To identify potential outliers in each measured field, a well established resistant outlier detection rule was applied (20Hoaglin, D. C., Iglewicz, B., and Tukey, J. W. (1086) J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 81, 991–999Google Scholar). For the outlier-trimmed dermal fibril diameters, it was adequate to assume a symmetric but not Gaussian dominant component. Therefore, the median was used as a measure of central location for each field. The negative-specific medians of outlier-trimmed data were modeled in a linear mixed effects model (21Vonesh E.F. Chinchilli V.M. Linear and Nonlinear Models for the Analysis of Repeated Measures. Marcel Dekker, New York1997Google Scholar) incorporating animal-to-animal and negative-to-negative variability. Analyses of the number of fibrils/unit area (including the identified outliers) also were modeled in a linear mixed effects model because the normal distribution assumptions were reasonable. Targeted Disruption of col5a1 and Survivability of Offspring—The region of col5a1 to be targeted was identified in the Celera data base of mouse genomic sequences. Two sequences flanking exons 3 and 4 were amplified from KG-1 ES cell DNA and cloned into a targeting vector containing a neomycin cassette (Fig. 1A). The construct was confirmed by sequence analysis. KG-1 ES cells were transfected with linearized target vector by electroporation. Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B) of G418-resistant ES cell clones identified one of 300 clones containing the homologously recombined gene that replaced most of exons 3 and 4 with the neomycin cassette. Chimeric males that were generated using this clone were mated to C57BL/6 or 129SVe females to obtain germ line transmission. Genetic analysis (Fig. 1C) of offspring of heterozygous matings was consistent with preterm lethality of col5a1–/– offspring, but embryos harvested between embryonic days 8.5 and 11 showed expected Mendelian ratios (Table I). col5a1–/– embryos were found dead at day 11 and were resorbed completely by day 12 (data not shown).Table IGenotype analysis of offspring from col5a1+/– intercrossesGenotypeE10Birthcol5a1 +/+3567col5a1 +/-53103col5a1 -/-320Total120170 Open table in a new tab Targeted Recombination of col5a1 Prevents Gene Expression—Total RNA isolated from the tails of col5a1+/+ and col5a1+/– animals showed a 50% reduction of col5a1-derived mRNA compared with col5a2 and col1a1, as found by ribonuclease protection assay (data not shown). The ribonuclease protection assay probe was complementary to nucleotides encoding a portion of the C-propeptide, including exon 64, thus excluding the possibility that a transcript encoding a truncated peptide would have a dominant negative effect by co-assembling with wild type pro-α1(V) or pro-α2(V) chains. Type V collagen was not secreted by fibroblasts derived from col5a1–/– embryos. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that pro-collagens precipitated from the medium of cultured fibroblasts lacked pro-α1(V) chains that were detected on Western blots from wild type fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). Detection using antibody to COL1A1 (LF41) showed similar amounts of type I collagen from both +/+ and –/– animals (data not shown). Type V collagen was absent from the medium of fibroblasts that was labeled biosynthetically with [3H]proline. Electrophoretic analysis of the labeled collagens from the medium of the col5a1–/– cells compared with the col5a1+/+ cells also demonstrated that the α1(V) chains were absent (Fig. 2B). Phenotype of col5a1–/– Embryos—Before embryonic day 10.5, col5a1–/– embryos were indistinguishable from +/+ and +/– littermates. At the time of dissection, E10 embryos were approximately the same size; however, more blood was apparent in col5a1+/+ and +/– embryos (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, blood-filled vessels were evident in col5a1+/+ and +/– but not in col5a1–/– yolk sacs (Fig. 3, C and D). Pooled blood was observed frequently in the col5a1–/– embryos even before cessation of the rhythmic contractions of the heart, indicating that cardiovascular insufficiency was a factor in embryonic demise. Whole mount in situ hybridization experiments in wild type embryos demonstrated that col5a1 is expressed throughout the ectoderm, with higher levels of expression within the somites, condensing limb mesenchyme, and umbilical vessels at E11 (Fig. 4). In the yolk sac, the expression is intense in the umbilical vessels and in some smaller vessels as well (Fig. 4E). col5a1 gene expression appears to be a normal part of early connective tissue formation in vascular tissue and dermis, tissues that are associated with phenotypic abnormalities in humans with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and COL5A1 haploinsufficiency (19Wenstrup R.J.

To examine the effects of type V collagen deficiency on the development of connective tissues, ultrastructural analysis of predermal mesenchyme of col5a1–/– and wild type embryos was performed.Fig. 4Whole mount in situ col5a1 expression in wild type embryos.

In wild type embryos, there were numerous small diameter fibrils located subectodermally (Fig. 5A) that were localized throughout the mesenchyme (Fig. 5C). In contrast, collagen fibrils were completely absent in the mesenchyme of col5a1–/– mice (Fig. 5D). A small number of very large diameter fibrils were observed in the embryos; however, the distribution of these abnormal fibrils was limited to the ectodermal basement membrane zone at the stromal interface (Fig. 5B). Analysis of the very limited number of fibrils that were observed in the region adjacent to the ectodermal basement membrane demonstrated that the fibrils were much larger than fibrils found in the same region in +/+ animals (Fig. 6). In contradistinction to what was observed in the normal embryos, all fibrils found in the ectodermal basement membrane region in the –/– animals were misshapen and had irregular borders (Fig. 6, compare A and B insets).Fig. 6Electron micrographs of collagen fibril architecture in col5a1+/+ and col5a1–/– embryos. The collagen fibrils assembled by the –/– embryos are structurally abnormal. A, the wild type embryos assemble large numbers of small diameter collagen fibrils with circular profiles in the space subjacent to the ectodermal basement membrane. In contrast, the –/– embryos assemble far fewer fibrils. These fibrils have abnormally large diameters (B). The few fibrils assembled by the col5a1-deficient embryos have very irregular crosssectional profiles (B, inset) compared with the small, cylindrical profile seen in the wild type embryos (A, inset). Bar = 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These data indicate a lack of normal fibril assembly in the mesenchyme of mice lacking type V collagen. These roles are implied by the observed lack of type V collagen in the initiation of fibril assembly and regulation of the initial assembly. These roles are associated with a lack of normal collagen fibrils, a severe reduction in number and distribution, and resulting embryonic lethality. To further address the role of type V collagen in the regulation of fibrillogenesis, the effects of reduced copy number were studied in the postnatal dermis. The Dermis of Mature col5a1+/– Mice Contains Abnormal Collagen Fibrils—The dermis of mature col5a1 haploinsufficient mice is characterized by large numbers of structurally aberrant collagen fibrils (Fig. 7). The mature wild type dermis is composed of a relatively homogeneous population of cylindrical fibrils at 12 weeks (Fig. 7, A and B). In contrast, the 12-week-old col5a1+/– dermis contained cylindrical fibrils and a population of larger, abnormal fibrils with very irregular contours (Fig. 7, C and D). In addition to the structurally abnormal fibrils, the haploinsufficient animals were characterized by a decreased number of collagen fibrils present in the dermis. This decrease in fibril density observed in col5a1+/– versus wild type animals was found at all postnatal stages examined (postnatal day 10, 45, and 90) (data not shown). At postnatal week 12, col5a1+/– animals had ∼46% of the dermal collagen fibrils present in the wild type littermates (Fig. 8A). This difference was significant (p = 0.004) as found by comparing the mean number of dermal fibrils in haploinsufficient (104, 95% CI, 68 to 140) and wild type (194, 95% CI, 158 to 230) animals. The reduced fibril number correlated with a decrease in skin collagen as measured by the amount of hydroxyproline in 8-week-old animals (Fig. 8B). Quantitation of collagen as the amount of hydroxyproline deposited in cultured embryonic fibroblasts from +/– animals showed a similar reduction in total collagen deposition after 14 days in culture compared with cells from +/+ animals; cells from –/– embryos had >95% reduction in hydroxyproline deposition compared with +/+ animals (data not shown).Fig. 8Fibril number and collagen content in the skin of wild type (+/+) and col5a1 (+/–). A, col5a1+/– animals had ∼54% of the dermal collagen fibrils seen in comparable areas from wild type littermates. At 12 weeks, the haploinsufficient animals had significantly fewer dermal collagen fibrils/unit area than the wild type animals, an average of 104 fibrils/2 μm2 (95% CI, 68 to 140) versus 114 fibrils/2 μm2 (95% CI, 158 to 230), respectively (p = 0.004). B, a reduced fibril number correlated with a reduction in skin collagen measured as the amount of hydroxyproline/mm2 (p = 0.0002). Error bars represent means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dermal Fibril Diameter Distributions—The diameter of fibrils from the dermis of mature, 12-week-old wild type and col5a1+/– mice was analyzed. The wild type dermis contained a roughly symmetric distribution of fibril diameters, whereas the col5a1+/– dermis was composed of a population of fibrils comparable with the wild type and a second population of fibrils with much larger diameters (Fig. 9). These two populations of fibrils, one with circular contours comparable with the wild type controls and one with large fibrils with irregular contours, were found at ages from embryonic day 10 (Fig. 6B) to postnatal week 20 (data not shown). The finding of irregular fibrils at the earliest stages indicates that this structural phenotype reflects deficiencies in initial fibril assembly and not merely secondary effects related to fibril growth, stability, or turnover. Statistical Analyses of Fibril Populations—The main symmetric population of cylindrical fibrils and the frequency of large diameter, structurally abnormal fibrils and outliers in the col5a1 haploinsufficient dermis were compared with the wild type controls. Fibril diameters from five wild type animals (34 negatives, 3–8 diameters/animal) and from five mutant animals (30 negatives, 3–8 diameters/animal) were analyzed. In the wild type group, a total of 221 (3.2%) outliers was observed among 6815 observations, including 129 (1.9%) abnormally large diameters and 7 (0.1%) extremely large ones. In the mutant group, there was a total of 143 (4.3%) outliers among 3340 observations, including 121 (3.6%) abnormally large diameters and 28 (0.8%) extremely large ones.

They interact with several other telomere regulators including TIN2, PTOP, POT1, and RAP1 to ensure proper maintenance of telomeres. TRF1 and TRF2 are believed to exert distinct functions. TRF1 forms a complex with TIN2, PTOP, and POT1 and regulates telomere length, whereas TRF2 mediates t-loop formation and end protection. However, whether cross-talk occurs between the TRF1 and TRF2 complexes and how the signals from these complexes are integrated for telomere maintenance remain to be elucidated. Through gel filtration and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that TRF1 and TRF2 are in fact subunits of a telomere-associated high molecular weight complex (telosome) that also contains POT1, PTOP, RAP1, and TIN2. We demonstrated that the TRF1-interacting protein TIN2 binds TRF2 directly and in vivo, thereby bridging TRF2 to TRF1. Consistent with this multi-protein telosome model, stripping TRF1 off the telomeres by expressing tankyrase reduced telomere recruitment of not only TIN2 but also TRF2. These results help to unify previous observations and suggest that telomere maintenance depends on the multi-subunit telosome.

These results help to unify previous observations and suggest that telomere maintenance depends on the multi-subunit telosome. The homeostasis of mammalian telomeres is regulated by a number of telomere-associated proteins. Among these proteins, TRF1 and TRF2 directly bind double-stranded telomere DNA and interact with a number of proteins to maintain telomere length and structure (1de Lange T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kim Sh S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 503-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the amount of telomere-bound TRF1 correlates with telomere length. Overexpression of TRF1 shortened telomeres in human cells, whereas dominant negative TRF1 led to elongated telomeres (3van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 4Smith S. de Lange T. Curr.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). TRF1 may control the length of telomere repeats through multiple mechanisms. For example, TRF1 can control telomerase access through its interaction with TIN2, PTOP/PIP1, and the single-stranded telomere DNA-binding protein POT1 (6Loayza D. De Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 7Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat.

Cell. 2001; 107: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In comparison, TRF2 has an essential role in telomere end protection and t-loop formation (1de Lange T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T.

Interference of endogenous TRF2 activity by expressing dominant negative forms of TRF2 markedly increased the rate of telomere end-to-end fusions (12van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Consistent with this role of TRF2, TRF2 forms a complex with RAP1 and associates with several proteins involved in DNA damage and repair responses, notably RAD50/MER11/NBS1, Ku86, and ERCC1/XPF (13Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 14Zhu X.D. Niedernhofer L. Kuster B. Mann M. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Lange T. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 28585-28591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These findings have pointed to distinct biological functions of TRF1 and TRF2. Some recent findings, however, suggest a more complex picture. For instance, overexpression of TRF2 caused telomere shortening in primary cells (16Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In mouse embryonic stem cells, the conditional knockout of TRF1 led to significantly reduced levels of TRF2 at the telomeres, suggesting that TRF2 telomere localization may be partially regulated by TRF1 (17Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, chromosome end-to-end fusion was detected in TRF1 knock-out cells, indicating that telomere end protection was compromised. Despite the wealth of information, the functional relationship between TRF1 and TRF2 in telomere maintenance remains unclear. Notably, a recent report demonstrated a direct interaction between TRF2 and the TRF1-interacting protein, TIN2 (18Kim S.H. Beausejour C. Davalos A.R. Kaminker P. Heo S.J. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43799-43804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Such findings further suggest that cross-talk probably occurs between the TRF1 and TRF2 complexes. However, whether TIN2 can simultaneously associate with both TRF1 and TRF2 in the same complex remains to be demonstrated. In addition to TRF1, several other telomeric proteins have been shown to be regulators of telomere length (1de Lange T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kim Sh S.H.

These observations suggest that RAP1, TIN2, POT1, and PTOP may function in the same pathway. All four proteins, RAP1, TIN2, POT1, and PTOP, directly or indirectly associate with TRF1 or TRF2 (7Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 8Ye J.Z. Hockemeyer D. Krutchinsky A.N. Loayza D.

Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), pointing to a possible functional connection among these six telomeric proteins. In this report, we present evidence demonstrating that the TRF1 and TRF2 complexes do indeed interact with each other, as TRF1, TRF2, RAP1, TIN2, POT1, and PTOP can form a protein complex in vivo to regulate telomeres. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—HeLa S3 cells grown in suspension to 1 × 106 cells/ml were collected and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The cells were then allowed to swell for 15 min in hypotonic buffer, homogenized until cell membrane lysis was ∼80%. The lysates were resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA) and homogenized briefly to break the nuclear membrane. An equal volume of high salt buffer (1.2 m KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA) was added followed by agitation for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed in BC0 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 3 h and centrifuged again. The cleared supernatant was then aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Salt extraction and fractionation of HT1080 cells were performed as previously described previously (23Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The cells were extracted in a low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 25% glycerol, protease inhibitors, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 150 mm KCl). The resulting supernatant was the 150 mm fraction. The pellet was further extracted with a similar buffer but containing 420 mm KCl. Chromatin-bound proteins were in the 420 mm KCl fraction. Immunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometry—For large-scale affinity purification, ∼70 mg of nuclear protein extracts were incubated with 100 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 4 times with NETN (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA), and the bound protein was eluted twice with 100 μlof200 μg/ml FLAG peptide-(DYKDDDDK) (Sigma) in NETN. The eluent was resolved on a 8–12% SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Specific bands were then excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to ion-trap mass spectrometry as previously described (24Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Peptides were identified using PROWL (prowl.rockefeller.edu/). For small-scale immunoprecipitation experiments, 1 mg of nuclear extracts was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-hRap1 (Bethyl Laboratories), anti-TRF2 (Oncogene), anti-POT1N, anti-TIN2C, or anti-PTOP 466 antibodies (7Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and 15 μl of protein A or protein G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were then washed four times with 0.5 ml of NETN, boiled in 2× SDS loading buffer, and resolved on 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Fractionation of the Telomere-associated Complex, Telosome—Chromatographic experiments were performed as described previously (7Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were fractionated on ΔKTA Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration columns (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with various antibodies. Generation of Constructs and Cell Lines of hRap1 and Its Deletion Mutants—FLAG-tagged full-length hRap1 and various hRap1 mutants were cloned in the pBabe-puro retroviral vector as previously described (15O'Connor M.S. Safari A. Liu D. Qin J. Songyang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28585-28591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The retroviral wild type and mutant FLAG-tankyrase (TANK) vectors were a generous gift from Dr. Titia de Lange (23Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The retroviral vectors were used to transfect BOSC23 cells to produce retroviruses for the subsequent infection of HeLa or HT1080 cells. These cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 3 days after infection to obtain cells stably expressing hRap1 and its mutants or TANK. Antibodies and Western Blotting Analysis—For Western analysis, immunoprecipitates and nuclear extract controls were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The primary antibodies included anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and anti-TRF2 (Oncogene). The rabbit polyclonal anti-POT1N antibody was generated against GST-tagged human POT1 protein (amino acids 1–253). Anti-RAP1, anti-TIN2C, and anti-PTOP 466 antibodies were previously described (7Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). These antibodies were generated by the Bethyl Laboratories. Anti-TRF1 antibody was a generous gift from the de Lange laboratory (3van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies included anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Binding Assays—Bacterially expressed GST full-length POT1, RAP1, and TIN2 were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Molecular Probes). Approximately 1 μg of GST fusion proteins on beads was used for each binding reaction. In vitro translation and [35S]Met labeling of human TRF1 and TRF2 were carried out using the In Vitro TnT kit (Promega). The mixtures were washed three times with NETN, eluted with 2× SDS buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes followed by analysis using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Indirect Immunofluorescence—The localization of telomere-associated proteins were visualized through indirect immunofluorescence as previously described (20Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Cells were grown overnight on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips, permeabilized in the Triton X-100 solution (0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline), fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized again in the Triton X-100 solution containing 300 mm sucrose. The cells were subsequently blocked for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% goat serum, stained with various primary and fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h each at 37 °C, and then visualized under a Nikon TE200 fluorescence microscope. The primary antibodies used were: polyclonal anti-TRF1; anti-TIN2C antibody; and monoclonal anti-TRF2 antibody (Oncogene). Secondary antibodies were AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) and Texas Red goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes). Identification of a Telomere-associated Protein Complex, Telosome—Individual proteins can be epitope-tagged, which allows for easy isolation and identification of their associated proteins by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. We undertook such a proteomic approach to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate human telomeres. In our analysis of the purified RAP1 protein complex, we identified several proteins that are known to interact with RAP1, including RAD50, Mre11, Ku86/70, and TRF2 (Fig. 1A) (13Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 15O'Connor M.S. Safari A. Liu D. Qin J. Songyang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28585-28591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the sequencing of the 40-kDa band revealed TIN2 as a component of the RAP1 complex as well. The same RAP1 complex was able to form even in the presence of ethidium bromide, suggesting that the interactions between the various components were not mediated through DNA (data not shown). The presence of TIN2 in the RAP1·TRF2 complex was surprising, because TIN2 is a TRF1-interacting protein (19Kim S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Our purification and characterization of TIN2-associated proteins further confirmed the existence of a RAP1·TIN2 protein complex, as we found TRF2 and RAP1 to co-purify with TRF1, TIN2, PTOP, and POT1 (7Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mass spectrometry sequencing revealed the six proteins to be the major components of the isolated complex (7Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Because TIN2, PTOP, and POT1 have been shown to complex with TRF1 (6Loayza D. De Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 7Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 8Ye J.Z. Hockemeyer D. Krutchinsky A.N. Loayza D. Hooper S.M. Chait B.T. de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), it suggests that TRF2 and RAP1 may interact with the TRF1 complex, resulting in the formation of a six-protein complex at the telomeres. To determine the interaction between the six telomeric proteins, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells and antibodies against endogenous POT1, PTOP, TIN2, RAP1, or TRF2. Consistent with our previous observations (7Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S. Chan D.W. Laegeler A. Qin J. Songyang Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), endogenous POT1 and PTOP co-immunoprecipitated with TIN2, whereas immunoprecipitation with anti-PTOP and anti-TIN2 antibodies brought down POT1 (Fig. 1B). Notably, TRF2 was also able to co-immunoprecipitate with POT1, PTOP, and TIN2. In the reciprocal experiment, antibodies against TRF2 or RAP1 brought down POT1 and TIN2 as well. These data strongly support our findings that TRF2 and RAP1 associate with the TRF1 complex and suggest a cross-talk between the TRF1 and TRF2 complexes. We performed gel filtration experiments next using HeLa nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 2, endogenous TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, RAP1, PTOP, and POT1 co-eluted in a large molecular complex (∼1 MDa), indicating that the six-telomeric proteins could indeed form a physical complex that contains the major telomeric proteins identified to date in mammalian cells. Based on the above data, we named this large complex, containing the six telomeric proteins, the telosome. It should be noted that some of the telomeric proteins (e.g. RAP1 and TRF2) were also co-eluted at lower molecular weight fractions. Therefore, there may be other telomere complexes in addition to the telosome. TIN2 Directly Binds TRF2 Both in Vitro and in Vivo and Tethers TRF2 to the TRF1 Complex—We next examined how the TRF2·RAP1 subcomplex was connected to the TRF1 subcomplex in the telosome. RAP1 contains an N-terminal BRCA1 C-terminal domain, a Myb domain, and a C-terminal TRF2-binding RAP1 C-terminal domain (RCT) (20Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We first set out to determine which of the domains of RAP1 were necessary for its association with TIN2. As shown in Fig. 1A, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation of full-length RAP1 brought down endogenous TRF2 and TIN2. An analysis of a series of RAP1 deletion mutants available in the laboratory (15O'Connor M.S. Safari A. Liu D. Qin J. Songyang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28585-28591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) revealed that the BRCA1 C-terminal and Myb domains were dispensable in mediating RAP1 interaction with TRF2 and TIN2 (Fig. 3A). However, the RAP1 C-terminal domain deletion mutant (ΔRCT) failed to co-immunoprecipitate with not only endogenous TRF2 but also TIN2, indicating that RAP1 may associate with TIN2 through TRF2. Furthermore, these data suggest a direct interaction between TRF2 and TIN2 (or other components of the TRF1 complex). To test this hypothesis, TRF2 was in vitro translated and incubated with GST fusion telomeric proteins. As shown in Fig. 3B, in vitro translated TRF2 specifically bound GST-TIN2 (at a level comparable to GST-RAP1) but not GST-POT1. GST-TIN2 but not GST-RAP1 specifically pulled down in vitro translated TRF1 (Fig. 3B, right panel). Therefore, both TRF1 and TRF2 can directly interact with TIN2. Moreover, specific interactions between V5-tagged TRF2 and FLAG-tagged TIN2 were detected in 293T cells (data not shown). Consistent with a recent report on TIN2 interaction with TRF2 (18Kim S.H. Beausejour C. Davalos A.R. Kaminker P. Heo S.J. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43799-43804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), our results indicate that TIN2 provides the link between the TRF1 and TRF2 complexes. Telomeric Localization of Telosome Subunits Is Regulated by TRF1—To further address the functional relevance of telosome as well as the interaction between TRF1 and TRF2, we investigated whether telomere localization of telosome subunits, in particular TRF2, was regulated by TRF1 using HT1080 cells expressing FLAG-tagged wild type TANK or catalytically inactive TANK (TANK-PD). TANK is a TRF1-associated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (25Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). TANK can ADP-ribosylate TRF1, resulting in TRF1 ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome pathway, effectively stripping TRF1 off the telomeres (25Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 26Chang W. Dynek J.N. Smith S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In these cells, FLAG-TANK and TANK-PD were expressed at comparable levels, whereas total TIN2 and TRF2 levels were not reduced (data not shown). We then compared the levels of telomere-localized TRF1, TRF2, and TIN2 in these cells using indirect immunofluorescence. Endogenous TRF1, TRF2, and TIN2 exhibited punctate staining patterns, characteristic of telomeric proteins (Fig. 4). As previously reported (17Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), telomere-bound TRF1 was greatly reduced in cells expressing wild type TANK compared with TANK-PD-expressing cells (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the number and intensity of TIN2 foci decreased significantly in wild type TANK-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). The direct interaction between TIN2 and TRF2 suggests that TRF2 telomere localization may be affected in TANK-expressing cells as well. Indeed, in cells in which TRF1 levels were reduced because of TANK expression, anti-TRF2 staining also decreased (Fig. 4A). Consistent with this observation, the amounts of chromatin-bound TIN2 and TRF2 in TANK-expressing cells were also reduced, as analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). These results are not only consistent with the finding that TRF2 telomere localization was altered in TRF1 knock-out cells (17Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) but also provide further support for the six-protein core telosome model. In this case, eliminating TRF1 could prevent telosome formation, thereby preventing telomere localization of TIN2 and TRF2. Therefore, telomere localization of TRF2 may depend upon the formation of telosome. All six proteins, TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, RAP1, POT1, and PTOP, have been shown to specifically localize to the telomeres in mammalian cells. Functional interference with any of the six proteins by RNAi or dominant negative expression has been known to affect telomere length or end capping (3van Steensel B. de Lange T.

Therefore, these proteins probably are the major players of telomere maintenance. In a recent study by Kim et al. (18Kim S.H. Beausejour C. Davalos A.R. Kaminker P. Heo S.J. Campisi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43799-43804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the authors showed a direct interaction between TIN2 and TRF2. In this report, we demonstrated that TIN2/TRF2 interaction provides only one piece of the puzzle, because all six telomeric proteins are able to assemble into a high molecular weight complex, the telosome. While this paper was in review, Ye et al. (27Ye J.Z. Donigian J.R. Van Overbeek M. Loayza D. Luo Y. Krutchinsky A.N. Chait B.T. De Lange T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47264-47271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) also reported the discovery of the six-protein telomeric complex, which is consistent with our findings. The telosome model helps to explain why similar telomere extension phenotypes in human cells were obtained when RAP1, POT1, PTOP, or TIN2 was inhibited through RNAi or dominant negative expression (3van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 6Loayza D. De Lange T. Nature. 2003; 424: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 7Liu D. Safari A. O'Connor M.S.

Incorporation of the dominant negative forms of a subunit into the telosome may prevent its normal function, and knock-down of one of the six proteins by RNAi will probably hinder telosome formation. Additionally, the stoichiometry of telosome subunits may be crucial to its proper assembly. For example, the knock-down of TIN2 through RNAi led to reduced TRF1 localization at the telomeres (23Ye J.Z. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 618-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In further support of a critical role of the telosome in maintaining telomere integrity, inactivation of TIN2 or TRF1 in mice resulted in embryonic lethality (14Zhu X.D. Niedernhofer L. Kuster B. Mann M. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 30Chiang Y.J. Kim S. Tessarollo L. Campisi J. Hodes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6631-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the TRF1 knock-out mouse, telomeric localization of TRF2 and TIN2 was also disrupted (17Iwano T. Tachibana M. Reth M. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 1442-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both TRF1 and TRF2 can bind telomeric double-stranded DNA. The functional difference between these two proteins is probably due to their abilities to recruit different signaling complexes. TRF1 plays a primary role in telomere length control and cell cycle, whereas TRF2 protects telomere ends from being recognized as DNA breaks. It was unclear whether communication could occur between the TRF1 and TRF2 complexes. Our results suggested that TRF1 and TRF2 interact with each other through TIN2 and highlight the functional connection between TRF1 and TRF2. The identification of the telosome unites two essential pathways in telomere maintenance, telomere length, and end protection and suggests coordinated action and functional cross-talk between its subcomplexes. Functionally similar to the budding yeast telosome (28Wright J.H. Gottschling D.E. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 29Dubrana K. Perrod S. Gasser S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the mammalian telosome may represent the core telomere-associated complex mediating telomere maintenance in mammalian cells. Each of the six telomeric proteins may interact with many other different proteins to form unique subcomplexes, allowing for the dynamic integration and processing of signals from diverse pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2002514583,"Three members of the ghrelin receptor family were characterized in parallel: the ghrelin receptor, the neurotensin receptor 2 and the orphan receptor GPR39. In transiently transfected COS-7 and human embryonic kidney 293 cells, all three receptors displayed a high degree of ligand-independent signaling activity. The structurally homologous motilin receptor served as a constitutively silent control; upon agonist stimulation, however, it signaled with a similar efficacy to the three related receptors. The constitutive activity of the ghrelin receptor and of neurotensin receptor 2 through the Gq, phospholipase C pathway was ∼50% of their maximal capacity as determined through inositol phosphate accumulation. These two receptors also showed very high constitutive activity in activation of cAMP response element-driven transcription. GPR39 displayed a clear but lower degree of constitutive activity through the inositol phosphate and cAMP response element pathways. In contrast, GPR39 signaled with the highest constitutive activity in respect of activation of serum response element-dependent transcription, in part, possibly, through G12/13 and Rho kinase. Antibody feeding experiments demonstrated that the epitope-tagged ghrelin receptor was constitutively internalized but could be trapped at the cell surface by an inverse agonist, whereas GPR39 remained at the cell surface. Mutational analysis showed that the constitutive activity of both the ghrelin receptor and GPR39 could systematically be tuned up and down depending on the size and hydrophobicity of the side chain in position VI:16 in the context of an aromatic residue at VII:09 and a large hydrophobic residue at VII:06. It is concluded that the three ghrelin-like receptors display an unusually high degree of constitutive activity, the structural basis for which is determined by an aromatic cluster on the inner face of the extracellular ends of TMs VI and VII.

G protein-coupled receptors are to some degree constitutively active, in that they are able to change into an active conformation without the presence of the agonist ligand (1Schwartz T.W. Holst B. Forman J.C. Johansen T. Textobok of Receptor Pharmacology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2002: 81-110Google Scholar). For the majority of receptors, the constitutive activity is so low that it is not picked up by the various signaling assays employed. Some receptors, however, such as the β2-adrenergic receptors show a low but significant degree of constitutive activity of perhaps 3-10% of the maximal signaling capacity depending on the system in which it is studied (2Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). A few endogenous receptors have been described to display very high constitutive activity (for example, the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (3Savinainen J.R. Saario S.M. Niemi R. Jarvinen T. Laitinen J.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and certain sphingolipid receptors (4Uhlenbrock K. Gassenhuber H. Kostenis E. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)). However, it is still debated whether these receptors are in fact truly constitutively active, because it is difficult to rule out the possible presence of lipid ligands in the cellular system in which they are studied. Nevertheless, high constitutive activity is indisputably a hallmark of many virally encoded 7TM receptors such as ORF74 from human herpes virus 8 and US28 from human cytomegalovirus (5Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Bradshaw R. Dennis M. Handbook of Cell Signaling. Academic Press, Amsterdam2004Google Scholar). The virus has optimized, for example, ORF74 to signal constitutively with ∼50% efficacy and to be modulated positively by endogenous angiogenic chemokines and negatively by endogenous angiostatic or modulatory chemokines (6Holst P.J. Rosenkilde M.M. Manfra D. Chen S.C. Wiekowski M.T. Holst B. Cifire F. Lipp M. Schwartz T.W. Lira S.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Holst P.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26309-26315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Recently, we discovered that the receptor for the hormone ghrelin also signals with ∼50% of maximal activity in the absence of its peptide ligand (8Holst B. Cygankiewicz A. Halkjar J.T. Ankersen M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2201-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This receptor property remained unnoticed for many years because mobilization of intracellular calcium had been used almost exclusively to monitor the signal transduction activity of this receptor (9Smith R.G. Leonard R. Bailey A.R. Palyha O. Feighner S. Tan C. McKee K.K. Pong S.S. Griffin P. Howard A. Endocrine. 2001; 14: 9-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP) turnover was measured instead, it became clear that the ghrelin receptor in fact was highly constitutively active (8Holst B. Cygankiewicz A. Halkjar J.T. Ankersen M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2201-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Ghrelin is an acylated 28-amino acid peptide hormone that is released from endocrine cells of the stomach in the premeal situation and functions as an important orexigenic from the periphery that stimulates especially acute food intake. Neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide neurons of the arcuate nucleus are a major target of ghrelin in the hypothalamus. Ghrelin increases the firing rate and induces an increased expression and release of neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide (10Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Seeley R.J. Baskin D.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar, 11Schwartz M.W. Morton G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ghrelin also seems to exert important actions on energy expenditure, both through receptors on adipocytes and through modulation of thermogenesis (12Tschop M. Smiley D.L. Heiman M.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar, 13Choi K. Roh S.G. Hong Y.H. Shrestha Y.B. Hishikawa D. Chen C. Kojima M. Kangawa K. Sasaki S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that the high constitutive signaling activity of the ghrelin receptor could serve as a signaling set-point, for example, in the control of appetite and energy expenditure, where it would counterbalance a large number of inhibitory hormones and neurotransmitters, such as leptin, insulin, and PYY3-36 (14Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 113-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).The ghrelin receptor belongs to a small family of receptors for peptide hormones and neuropeptides; besides ghrelin, the family includes motilin, neurotensin, and neuromedin U (NMU) (Fig. 1A). Like ghrelin, motilin is expressed in neuroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract but acts mainly locally on neurons in the gut, where it stimulates meal-related secretions and motility of the intestine (15Inui A. Asakawa A. Bowers C.Y. Mantovani G. Laviano A. Meguid M.M. Fujimiya M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 439-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The motilin receptor is completely silent with respect to constitutive signaling and consequently serves as a good control receptor in this study, as in previous studies (8Holst B. Cygankiewicz A. Halkjar J.T. Ankersen M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2201-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Neurotensin is both a gut hormone and a neuropeptide located in various parts of the central nervous system (16Dobner P.R. Deutch A.Y. Fadel J. Life Sci. 2003; 73: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The receptor that mediates most of the functions of neurotensin is neurotensin receptor 1. However, a structurally related receptor NT-R2 was recently cloned and was shown to bind neurotensin with lower affinity; it is interesting that neurotensin apparently has only minimal effects on the signaling of this receptor (17Richard F. Barroso S. Martinez J. Labbe-Jullie C. Kitabgi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that in the context of the present study, NT-R2, like the ghrelin receptor, signals constitutively with ∼50% of its maximal efficacy as determined by measurements of IP accumulation (17Richard F. Barroso S. Martinez J. Labbe-Jullie C. Kitabgi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). NMU is a neuropeptide that acts through two structurally related receptors, NMU receptors 1 and 2 (18Brighton P.J. Szekeres P.G. Willars G.B. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). There are no indications in the literature or in our preliminary studies that these receptors are constitutively active. 2B. Holst and T. W. Schwartz, unpublished observations.2B. Holst and T. W. Schwartz, unpublished observations.Among the members of the ghrelin receptor family is an orphan receptor, GPR39, that, together with GPR38 (later deorphanized as the motilin receptor), were initially cloned as structural homologues to the ghrelin receptor (19McKee K.K. Tan C.P. Palyha O.C. Liu J. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Genomics. 1997; 46: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Very little information is available concerning GPR39 except that Northern blot analysis indicates that its peripheral expression is restricted to the stomach and the small intestine, whereas it is much more widely expressed in the central nervous system (19McKee K.K. Tan C.P. Palyha O.C. Liu J. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Genomics. 1997; 46: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Inspired by the knowledge of the high constitutive signaling of the ghrelin receptor and the NT-R2 receptor, we cloned the human GPR39 and discovered that it is also was highly constitutively active. In the present study, the signaling properties of the three constitutively active members of the ghrelin receptor family are characterized in parallel, and the internalization property of GPR39 is compared with that of the ghrelin receptor. Furthermore, through a mutational analysis of the opposing faces of TMs III, VI, and VII of the ghrelin receptor in particular, an aromatic cluster is identified that seems to be structurally important for the constitutive activity of this family of receptors. This was verified through a series of corresponding substitutions in both the ghrelin receptor and GPR39 at position VI:16 with residues of variable aromaticity and size through which the constitutive activity could systematically be tuned up and down.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Ghrelin, [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]-substance P, motilin, and neurotensin were purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). LY294002 and Y27632 were from Calbiochem. Pertussis toxin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.Molecular Biology—The cDNA for the motilin receptor was provided by Bruce Conklin (The Gladstone Institute, San Francisco, CA) and the cDNA for the human herpes virus 8 encoded ORF74 receptor by Mette Rosenkilde (University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark). The human ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor cDNA and the GPR39 were cloned by PCR from a human brain cDNA library. The cDNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Mutations were constructed by PCR using the overlap expression method (20Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases, purified, and cloned into pcDNA3. All PCR experiments were performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. All mutations were verified by restriction endonuclease mapping and subsequent DNA sequence analysis using an ABI 310 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).Transfections and Tissue Culture—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1885 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin. Cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation method with chloroquine addition as described previously (21Holst B. Zoffmann S. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For gene dose experiments, variable amounts of DNA were used. The amount of cDNA (20 μg/75 cm2) resulting in maximal signaling was that used for dose response curves. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin. Cells were transfected with Lipofect-AMINE 2000 (Invitrogen).Phosphatidylinositol Turnover—One day after transfection, COS-7 cells were incubated for 24 h with 5 μCi of [myo-3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) in 1 ml of medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin per well. Cells were washed twice in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum) and were incubated in 0.5 ml of buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 30 min. After stimulation with various concentrations of peptide for 45 min at 37 °C, cells were extracted with 10% ice-cold perchloric acid followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The resulting supernatants were neutralized with KOH in HEPES buffer, and the generated [3H]inositol phosphate was purified on Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 anion-exchange resin as described. Determinations were made in duplicate.CRE and SRE Reporter Assay—HEK293 cells (30,000 cells/well) seeded in 96-well plates were transiently transfected. In the case of the CRE reporter assay, the cells were transfected with a mixture of pFA2-CRE binding protein and pFR-Luc reporter plasmid or serum response element (SRE)-Luc (PathDetect; Stratagene) and the indicated amounts of receptor DNA. After transfection, cells were maintained in low serum (2.5%) throughout the experiments and were treated with the respective inhibitor of intracellular signaling pathways. One day after transfection, cells were treated with the respective ligands in an assay volume of 100 μl of medium for 5 h. The assay was terminated by washing the cells twice with PBS and addition of 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (LucLite; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). Luminescence was measured in a TopCounter (Top Count NXT; PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) for 5 s. Luminescence values are given as relative light units.Microscopy—The trafficking of cell surface receptors was observed by a live antibody labeling method. Stable HEK293 transfectants (selected in 0.8 mg/ml G418 sulfate) were grown to 50-70% confluence on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, transferred to humidified 35-mm Petri dishes, and treated for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C. Cells were labeled with M2 anti-FLAG antibody (15 μg/ml; Sigma Chemical Co.) and transferrin-Texas Red (1:200; Molecular Probes, Paisley, UK) for 30 min at 4° or 37 °C in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/1% bovine serum albumin (final volume, 25 μl). Subsequent treatments (15 min, 37 °C) with vehicle (5 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), ghrelin (final concentration, 100 nm), and [d-Arg1,d-Phe5,d-Trp7,9,Leu11]-substance P (100 nm) were terminated by two washes with ice-cold PBS. Processing for immunofluorescence microscopy was performed at room temperature. Cells were fixed (2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 15 min; quenched by PBS and 25 mm glycine; 2 × 5 min) and permeabilized (0.075% Triton X-100 in PBS, 5 min), and the primary antibody was then detected with goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 488 (1:200 in PBS/1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min; Molecular Probes). After removal of non-specifically bound secondary antibody (six washes), cells were postfixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, nuclear DNA stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma), and coverslips mounted in Mowiol 40-88 (Calbiochem). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as previously described in detail (22Sunyach C. Jen A. Deng J. Fitzgerald K.T. Frobert Y. Grassi J. McCaffrey M.W. Morris R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In brief, a vertical stack of 25-30 fluorescent images was acquired digitally on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope (63× oil objective; Omega Optical excitation and emission filter sets), using Openlab 2.0 (Improvision, Coventry, UK) to direct a piezo z-axis drive in 0.2-μm steps. The central 15 images for each fluorophore were then deconvolved to remove out-of-focus light (Openlab) and reconstructed in three dimensions (3.0 μm z-section) in Volocity (Improvision).MAP Kinase Assay—COS-7 cells (seeding density, 150,000 cells/well) were transfected in the assay plates. Two days after transfection, the indicated concentrations of ligand were added to assay medium without any serum and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by removal of the medium and two washing steps with ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed in sample buffer and separated on SDS/10% PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and Western blot analysis was carried out using 1:5000 dilution of mouse monoclonal antiphopho-ERK1/2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total ERK protein was determined using a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were probed anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometric analysis. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was normalized according to the loading of protein by expressing the data as a ratio of phospho-ERK1/2 over total ERK1/2. Results were expressed as percentage of the value obtained in nonstimulated, mock-transfected cells.Cell Surface Expression Measurement (ELISA)—Cells were transfected and seeded out in parallel with those used for IP accumulation assay. The cells were washed twice, fixed, and incubated in blocking solution (PBS/0.2% dry milk) for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were kept at room temperature for all subsequent steps. Cells were incubated 2 h with anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Sigma Chemical Co) in 1:300 dilution. After three washes, cells were incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:4000 dilution. After extensive washing, the immunoreactivity was revealed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase substrate according to manufacture's instruction.RESULTSSignaling through the Phospholipase C Pathway—Determination of IP accumulation was used as a measure of signaling through the Gαq, phospholipase C pathway in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. As described previously (8Holst B. Cygankiewicz A. Halkjar J.T. Ankersen M. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2201-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), the ghrelin receptor displays a high degree of constitutive signaling activity through the phospholipase C pathway, demonstrated by the gene dose-dependent but ligand-independent increase in IP production (Fig. 2A). Gene-dosing experiments with GPR39 also demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in IP accumulation in cells expressing the GPR 39 receptor as opposed to cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 2B). Surface ELISA of the FLAG-tagged GPR39 receptor confirmed that the gene-dosing experiments in fact did result in a dose-dependent surface expression of the orphan receptor (Fig. 2B, inset). The lack of an endogenous ligand for GPR39 prevented us from evaluating the degree of constitutive activity compared with the maximal stimulation achieved by the agonist. However, as a result of our general probing of receptors with meal-ions (24Elling C.E. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) we discovered that Zn(II) administered as ZnCl2 acted as a low potency agonist with an EC50 value of 34 μm in GPR39-transfected cells as opposed to non-transfected cells (Fig. 2C). The zinc ion increased the receptor-mediated signaling from 22 fmol/105 cells to 46 fmol/105 cells at the highest expression level (Fig. 2C). In parallel transfections of COS-7 cells, it was found that the ghrelin receptor displayed a higher level of constitutive activity compared with GPR39, although a slightly lower degree of surface expression was observed by ELISA. The highest achievable level of constitutive signaling activity observed for the ghrelin receptor was 45 fmol/105 cells (Fig. 2, A and C). Higher receptor gene doses resulted in lower responses in IP accumulation, and a similar phenomenon was observed in the in the downstream signaling pathways described below (data not shown). Addition of ghrelin further increased the IP signaling by ∼2-fold, to 80 fmol/105 cells.Fig. 2Constitutive signaling of the ghrelin receptor as determined by analysis of inositol phosphate turnover. A, gene-dosing experiments with the ghrelin receptor in transiently transfected COS-7 cells: basal constitutive activity (black bars) compared with ghrelin (100 nm) agonism (white bars). A and B, left, basal and agonist-induced activity in mock-transfected cells (empty vector pcDNA3-transfected cells) are shown for the highest amount of cDNA (20 μg). Gene dosing experiments with mock transfection have also been performed; the results showed the same low signaling level for all the DNA concentrations as observed for 20 μg of pcDNA3. B, gene-dosing experiments with GPR39 in transiently transfected COS-7 cells: basal constitutive activity (black bars) compared with Zn(II) (100 μm; white bars), which was identified as an agonist for GPR39. The inset shows the expression of GPR39 at the cell surface as measured by ELISA performed in parallel with the inositol phosphate turnover. C, dose-response curve for ghrelin on the ghrelin receptor (circle), neurotensin on NT-R2 (triangle), and Zn(II) as ZnCl2 on GPR39 (square). Data are mean ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The NT-R2 receptor has previously been described to signal through the phospholipase C pathway with ∼50% constitutive activity (17Richard F. Barroso S. Martinez J. Labbe-Jullie C. Kitabgi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which was in accordance with the observation that ligand-independent IP accumulation in COS-7 cells transfected with this receptor was similar to the levels observed in cells transfected with the ghrelin receptor (Fig. 2C). It is interesting that neurotensin did not act as an agonist, in that it did not further increase the signaling of the receptor above the basal level (Fig. 2C). In the study in which this phenomenon was initially described, the non-peptide ligand SR48.692 was used as a high potency agonist, which further increased the IP accumulation by ∼2-fold (17Richard F. Barroso S. Martinez J. Labbe-Jullie C. Kitabgi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The SR48.692 ligand was unfortunately not available for the present study Thus, the ghrelin receptor and NT-R2 signaled with a similar high constitutive activity corresponding to ∼50% of their maximal efficacy through the phospholipase C pathway. GPR39 also displayed constitutive activity through this pathway but only approximately half of that observed with the ghrelin and NT-R2 receptors.Signaling through the ERK MAP Kinase Pathway—7TM receptors can activate ERK signaling through several different pathways (26Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In the present study, we use the virally encoded receptor ORF74, which couples constitutively to ERK1/2 in COS-7 cells as a positive control (27Sodhi A. Montaner S. Patel V. Zohar M. Bais C. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4873-4880PubMed Google Scholar). ORF74 has been shown to signal constitutively through MAP kinase in COS-7 cells but not in HEK293 cells, which we could confirm. We also found that the ghrelin receptor did not signal constitutively through MAP kinase in HEK293 cells (27Sodhi A. Montaner S. Patel V. Zohar M. Bais C. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4873-4880PubMed Google Scholar).Transfection with ORF74 increased the basal MAP kinase signaling by ∼2-fold, and this could be further increased by the agonist GROα (Fig. 3). It was surprising, however, that none of the ghrelin-like receptors, which all display clear constitutive signaling through the phospholipase C pathway and through several other downstream pathways (see below), showed any clear sign of constitutive signaling through ERK1/2 (Fig. 3). Transfection with the ghrelin receptor did increase the basal ERK activity marginally by around 15% (n = 6). However, stimulation with the agonist ghrelin increased ERK phosphorylation by almost 3-fold, which is in accordance with previously published results (28Baldanzi G. Filigheddu N. Cutrupi S. Catapano F. Bonissoni S. Fubini A. Malan D. Baj G. Granata R. Broglio F. Papotti M. Surico N. Bussolino F. Isgaard J. Deghenghi R. Sinigaglia F. Prat M. Muccioli G. Ghigo E. Graziani A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Stimulation of GRP39-transfected COS-7 cells with ZnCl2 increased the ERK1/2 phosphorylation by ∼70%. Transfection with NT-R2 seemed to decrease the basal ERK phosphorylation slightly (i.e. ∼20% (n = 6)) compared with mock-transfected cells, and this effect was reversed by addition of neurotensin. Thus, none of the otherwise constitutively active members of the ghrelin receptor family showed clear ligand-independent signaling through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.Fig. 3Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling. A, representative example of basal signaling and maximal agonist-induced response of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in COS-7"
https://openalex.org/W1968010393,"Neuropeptides regulate a wide range of animal behavior including food consumption, circadian rhythms, and anxiety. Recently, Drosophila neuropeptide F, which is the homolog of the vertebrate neuropeptide Y, was cloned, and the function of Drosophila neuropeptide F in feeding behaviors was well characterized. However, the function of the structurally related short neuropeptide F (sNPF) was unknown. Here, we report the cloning, RNA, and peptide localizations, and functional characterizations of the Drosophila sNPF gene. The sNPF gene encodes the preprotein containing putative RLRF amide peptides and was expressed in the nervous system of late stage embryos and larvae. The embryonic and larval localization of the sNPF peptide in the nervous systems revealed the larval central nervous system neural circuit from the neurons in the brain to thoracic axons and to connective axons in the ventral ganglion. In the adult brain, the sNPF peptide was localized in the medulla and the mushroom body. However, the sNPF peptide was not detected in the gut. The sNPF mRNA and the peptide were expressed during all developmental stages from embryo to adult. From the feeding assay, the gain-of-function sNPF mutants expressed in nervous systems promoted food intake, whereas the loss-of-function mutants suppressed food intake. Also, sNPF overexpression in nervous systems produced bigger and heavier flies. These findings indicate that the sNPF is expressed in the nervous systems to control food intake and regulate body size in Drosophila melanogaster."
https://openalex.org/W2004442859,"Increased replicative longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae because of calorie restriction has been linked to enhanced mitochondrial respiratory activity. Here we have further investigated how mitochondrial respiration affects yeast life span. We found that calorie restriction by growth in low glucose increased respiration but decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production relative to oxygen consumption. Calorie restriction also enhanced chronological life span. The beneficial effects of calorie restriction on mitochondrial respiration, reactive oxygen species release, and replicative and chronological life span could be mimicked by uncoupling agents such as dinitrophenol. Conversely, chronological life span decreased in cells treated with antimycin (which strongly increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation) or in yeast mutants null for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (which removes superoxide radicals) and for RTG2 (which participates in retrograde feedback signaling between mitochondria and the nucleus). These results suggest that yeast aging is linked to changes in mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress and that mild mitochondrial uncoupling can increase both chronological and replicative life span.

These results suggest that yeast aging is linked to changes in mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress and that mild mitochondrial uncoupling can increase both chronological and replicative life span. The only intervention known to increase average and maximum life span in mammals is caloric restriction (CR), 1The abbreviations used are: CR, caloric restriction; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol; ERC, extrachromosomal rDNA circle; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium.1The abbreviations used are: CR, caloric restriction; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol; ERC, extrachromosomal rDNA circle; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; YPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium. a reduction of 25–60% in calorie intake without essential nutrient deficiency. This diet not only extends life span but also delays many unwanted effects of aging and age-related pathologies. CR is highly effective in a wide range of organisms, increasing life span by up to 50% in some species (reviewed in Refs. 1Weindruch R. Walford R.L. Fligiel S. Guthrie D. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 641-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 2Masoro E.J. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 3Barger J.L. Walford R.L. Weindruch R. Exp. Gerontol. 2003; 38: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the mechanisms through which it results in increased life span are still controversial (see Ref. 4Koubova J. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar for a critical review). A leading hypothesis on the mechanism through which CR prevents aging is that this process decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and, hence, the oxidation of cellular components (5Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar, 6Merry B.J. Aging Cell. 2004; 3: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7Sohal R.S. Free Radic. Biol.

Indeed, aging is usually accompanied by oxidative damage of DNA, proteins, and lipids (9Fraga C.G. Shigenaga M.K. Park J.W. Degan P. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4533-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 10Reverter-Branchat G. Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31983-31989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). CR promotes a metabolic shift resulting in more efficient electron transport in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (1Weindruch R. Walford R.L. Fligiel S. Guthrie D. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 641-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 5Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar). Faster and more efficient electron transport may lead to lower production of ROS by mitochondria, one of the major intracellular ROS sources. This occurs because of reduced leakage of electrons from the respiratory chain and/or lower oxygen concentrations in the mitochondrial microenvironment (11Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 12Starkov A.A. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Indeed, artificially increasing mitochondrial respiration using uncouplers such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) strongly prevents mitochondrial ROS release (11Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CR decreases ROS release/O2 consumed in isolated mammalian mitochondria (13Gredilla R. Barja G. Lopez-Torres M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), possibly because of enhanced expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (14Merry B.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1340-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15Bevilacqua L. Ramsey J.J. Hagopian K. Weindruch R. Harper M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E852-E861Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Despite this evidence supporting a correlation between ROS-induced damage and aging, a clear cause-effect relationship has been hard to establish, and conflicting results are often presented in the literature (see Ref. 4Koubova J. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar for a critical review). Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model system to study mechanisms of life span modulation. Two types of life span may be measured in S. cerevisiae: chronological and replicative (10Reverter-Branchat G. Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31983-31989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 16Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 26: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 17Harris N. Costa V. MacLean M. Mollapour M. Moradas-Ferreira P. Piper P.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Fabrizio P. Longo V.D. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Chronological life span is measured in the stationary growth phase, in which reproduction rates are low. Under these conditions, cells gradually senesce in a manner that may be related to ROS removal capacity (19Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 20Longo V.D. Liou L.L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, factors influencing chronological longevity (or aging in non-dividing cells) are expected to be different from those influencing replicative life span, which is defined by the number of generations a yeast cell produces when in logarithmic growth phase (16Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 26: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Possible shared pathways and differences in these forms of aging have not been thoroughly explored to date, and it is unclear which form of life span relates best to longevity in multicellular organisms. Replicative life span has been more extensively studied in yeast, and a hypothesis relating CR and changes in life span to altered gene expression has been developed using this model. Guarente and co-workers (21Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar) have shown that replicative life span extension in S. cerevisiae can be achieved by decreasing the culture media substrate content, a condition mimicking CR. Yeast replicative life span extension promoted by CR depends on the activity of the SIR2 gene. SIR2 codes for a histone deacetylase and prevents the formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs), which accumulate during replicative aging (16Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 26: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 22Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). Because Sir2p activity depends on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as a substrate, the effect of CR in yeast may be related to an increase in the NAD+/NADH ratios in restricted cells due to higher respiratory rates (23Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 24Lin S.J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Lower glucose levels increase respiration, shifting the preferred fermentation pathway toward oxidative phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 4Koubova J. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Guarente and co-workers (23Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) found that CR in yeast did not enhance the resistance of these cells to exogenous oxidants, such as paraquat or H2O2, or alter the expression of antioxidant enzymes, a finding presented as an indication for the lack of a ROS effect in replicative aging. However, oxidative stress is the result of an imbalance between ROS removal and ROS formation, which was not measured under their conditions. Furthermore, these authors detected increased respiratory rates in CR yeast (23Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), which may alter mitochondrial ROS release rates, as discussed above. It is thus important to reconsider a possible participation of changes in mitochondrial ROS release levels in the replicative life span effects of CR. Other aspects that warrant investigation are the comparison of replicative and chronological aging and the effects of factors known to influence replicative life span on chronological life span. CR and SIR2 have been extensively shown to enhance replicative life span by decreasing ERCs, but their effects on chronological life span have not, to our knowledge, been determined to date. Retrograde feedback between nucleus and mitochondria also plays a role in replicative life span by decreasing ERCs, as indicated by the fact that deletion of RTG2, a gene that plays a central role in relaying retrograde response signals, decreases replicative life span (25Borghouts C. Benguria A. Wawryn J. Jazwinski S.M. Genetics. 2004; 166: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the effect of RTG2 on chronological life span is also unknown. To analyze further the role of mitochondrial activity in yeast longevity, we measured the effects of CR on mitochondrial respiration and ROS release. We also tested the effects of well established regulators of mitochondrial ROS release and genes involved in the regulation of replicative aging on chronological life span, using a recently developed fluorescence technique. Finally, we uncovered links between respiration, ROS release, and aging in yeast by demonstrating that CR and mitochondrial uncoupling can affect both chronological and replicative life span. Yeast Strains and Media—S. cerevisiae W303–1A cells (R. Rothstein, Columbia University, New York, NY) were used in most experiments. EUROFAN BTY4741 wild type strain and strains harboring null mutations of SIR2, SOD2, and RTG2, named here ΔSIR2, ΔSOD2, and ΔRTG2, respectively, were used in Fig. 2, C and D. Cells were cultured at 30 °C with continuous shaking in standard YPD medium (26Myers A.M. Pape L.K. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) containing 0.5 or 2% glucose. Mitochondrial Isolation—Mitochondria were prepared from yeast strain W303–1A cultures grown in YPD to early stationary phase by the method of Faye et al. (27Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), except for the use of zymolyase 20,000 units/g (ICN) instead of glusulase to convert cells to spheroplasts. Mitochondria isolated in this manner present intact inner membranes and respiratory complexes (28Barros M.H. Netto L.E.S. Kowaltowski A.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Oxygen Consumption—O2 consumption was followed at 30 °C in isolated mitochondrial suspensions incubated in 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.5 mm EDTA in the presence of 2% ethanol, 0.5 mm malate, and 0.5 mm glutamate, using a computer-interfaced Clark electrode operating in an air-tight chamber with continuous stirring. Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) Release—H2O2 production was measured as described elsewhere (28Barros M.H. Netto L.E.S. Kowaltowski A.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by measuring the oxidation of 50 μm Amplex™ Red (Molecular Probes®) in the presence of 1.0 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). The incubation media contained 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.5 mm EDTA, using 2% ethanol, 0.5 mm malate, and 0.5 mm glutamate as substrates. The rate of Amplex™ oxidation was recorded at 30 °C using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with continuous stirring, operating at excitation and emission wavelengths of 563 and 587 nm, respectively. Yeast Chronological Life Span—Yeast were cultured with continuous shaking for 4 days at 30 °C. Viability was assessed in the stationary phase using the fluorescent FUN® 1 (Molecular Probes) probe. This method provides faster and more reliable results than colony counts (29Millard P.J. Roth B.L. Thi H.P. Yue S.T. Haugland R.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Culture quantities were determined by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm. ∼2 × 108 cells were added to 1 ml of reaction buffer consisting of 5 μm FUN® 1, 2% glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. FUN® 1 determines yeast metabolic activity through fluorimetric analysis. Only metabolically active cells can convert the bright green fluorescent probe into an intravacuolar orange-red compound in a manner independent of fermentation or respiratory metabolism (29Millard P.J. Roth B.L. Thi H.P. Yue S.T. Haugland R.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescent conversion was detected using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer with 470 nm excitation and 535 and 580 nm emission wavelengths. Data are expressed as the difference in 580 and 535 nm emissions over time, in arbitrary fluorescence units. Yeast Replicative Life Span—Replicative life span measures the number of generations a yeast cell is capable of generating by budding (30Sinclair D. Mills K. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 533-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and was determined as described previously (31Kennedy B.K. Austriaco Jr., N.R. Guarente L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1985-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of cells grown logarithmically overnight in liquid YPD or YPD supplemented with 10 nm DNP was plated on YPD and YPD + 10 nm DNP plates. A group of unbudded cells was separated from the rest by micromanipulation (TDM400™ micromanipulator and Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope) and allowed to produce buds. Fifty of these buds were removed and used as the starting mother cell population. The number of daughter cells (generations) for each mother cell was counted by following cell division and separating daughter cells. Cells were grown at 30 °C during the day and at 8 °C overnight. Each experiment involved ∼50 mother cells and was carried out three times independently. There was no significant variability among the independent repetitions. Statistical significance of life span differences was determined using a Mann-Whitney Rank sum test. ROS Release and O2 Consumption in CR and Control S. cerevisiae Mitochondria—Because CR increases mitochondrial respiratory rates (23Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that CR alters ROS production in isolated yeast mitochondria. To do so, we measured the release of H2O2, a membrane-permeable ROS, in suspensions of mitochondria isolated from S. cerevisiae grown in YPD containing 2 or 0.5% glucose, a condition previously shown to extend replicative life span (21Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although oxygen consumption rates tended to be larger in CR mitochondria (Fig. 1A), the release of H2O2 was not directly proportional to the oxygen consumption rates measured (panel B). In fact, H2O2 release/O2 consumption ratios in yeasts grown in 2% glucose were significantly higher than those of CR mitochondria (panel C), indicating that CR alters the quantity of H2O2 generated per O2 consumed. As a result, despite the fact that yeasts grown in 0.5% glucose display O2 consumption rates larger than those observed in 2% glucose (23Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), their total mitochondrial ROS release may be lower. Indeed, the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone, which artificially enhances respiration, decreased H2O2 production in S. cerevisiae mitochondria by 27% (panel D), as observed previously in animal tissues (11Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 12Starkov A.A. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). DNP (5 μm), a structurally unrelated uncoupler, also lowered H2O2 release by 25–30% (results not shown), whereas antimycin A, a respiratory inhibitor, strongly enhanced H2O2 release (panel D). Respiration and ROS in Yeast Chronological Life Span— Yeast CR has been shown to increase replicative life span (21Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar), but its effects on chronological life span have not been determined to date. To measure chronological life span, we grew cells in stationary phase and marked them with the fluorescent FUN® 1 probe, which is gradually metabolized in aerobic or anaerobic live cells, leading to a fluorescence peak at 580 nm when excited at 470 nm. Metabolically inactive cells do not process the probe and fluoresce at 535 nm. Thus, the difference in 580 and 535 nm fluorescence is proportional to the live/dead cell contents (29Millard P.J. Roth B.L. Thi H.P. Yue S.T. Haugland R.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that cells cultured under CR conditions (0.5% glucose) in stationary phase present a larger proportion of live cells than yeast grown in 2% glucose (Fig. 2A), indicating that CR also increases chronological life span. To verify the effects of respiration and ROS release on chronological life span, we used DNP as a mild uncoupler (to avoid cell death due to excessive H+ transport) and antimycin A to block respiration (Fig. 2B). We found that low doses of DNP (1–10 nm) significantly increase 2% glucose live cell contents, a result indicative of enhanced survival. This effect was not observed in cells grown in 0.5% glucose (results not shown). Higher DNP doses (100 nm, not shown, to 1 mm, Fig. 2B) did not affect or slightly decreased stationary phase viability relative to control cells, probably because of perturbed energy metabolism. On the other hand, the respiratory inhibitor antimycin A consistently and strongly increased dead cell contents at every concentration tested (Fig. 2B and results not shown). These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that ROS affect yeast viability during the stationary phase (20Longo V.D. Liou L.L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Confirming the idea that mitochondrial ROS determine chronological life span, the null mutant of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (ΔSOD2), which is incapable of dismutating intramitochondrial superoxide radicals to H2O2, showed decreased chronological life span relative to its wild type strain BTY4741 (Fig. 2C). A rtg2 mutant, which has been previously shown to present decreased replicative life span (25Borghouts C. Benguria A. Wawryn J. Jazwinski S.M. Genetics. 2004; 166: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) due to defective retrograde (mitochondria-nuclear) signaling, also presented decreased chronological life span (Fig. 2C). This result indicates more parallels between chronological and replicative life span in yeast. However, aspects affecting chronological and replicative life span were not identical. Although the BTY4741 strain also presented increased chronological life span in response to CR, deletion of SIR2, which is essential for the beneficial effects of CR in replicative life span (22Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar, 23Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), did not strongly decrease the effects of CR on chronological life span (Fig. 2D). Mild Uncoupling and Replicative Life Span—Because we found that mild uncoupling reproduces the effects of CR on mitochondrial respiration, H2O2 release, and chronological life span, we tested its effect on replicative life span. In three independent experiments involving 50 yeast mother cells each, we found that 10 nm DNP led to a small but reproducible and statistically significant increase of ∼15% in replicative life span (see Fig. 3 for a representative experiment). Thus, mild uncoupling mimics CR and increases both chronological and replicative life span. The role of mitochondrial metabolism, respiration, and ROS in life span and the beneficial effects of CR have been the focus of many studies. Although most research using animals has found an inverse correlation between levels of mitochondrial ROS and life span (reviewed in Refs. 5Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar, 6Merry B.J. Aging Cell. 2004; 3: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7Sohal R.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 8Barja G. Ageing Res. Rev. 2002; 1: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), a causative effect of ROS-promoted oxidation in limiting life span has been hard to establish because of the inconsistent and/or nonexistent effects of antioxidants (4Koubova J. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 32Barja G. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2004; 79: 235-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Further questions involving the role of ROS in life span have been uncovered by studies using S. cerevisiae as a model for aging and longevity (30Sinclair D. Mills K. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 533-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These studies, which focused on replicative life span, show that CR does not enhance the expression of redox-related genes or resistance against oxidative stress (23Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Although the authors suggest this evidence excludes a role for ROS in the replicative life span-extending effects of CR, they demonstrate that mitochondrial metabolism and respiration play a role in this process. By intensifying respiration, CR increases intracellular NAD+/NADH ratios and the activity of Sir2p, which prevents the accumulation of ERCs and loss of replicative ability in the logarithmic growth stage (24Lin S.J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4). Recently, the mammalian SIR2 orthologue, Sirt1, has been shown to be up-regulated as a result of CR (33Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Machado De Oliveira R. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). In this study, we have attempted to establish a more integrative link between mitochondrial metabolism, ROS, and both chronological and replicative life span. We began by measuring ROS release levels in mitochondria from yeasts grown under control and CR conditions and found that CR significantly decreases ROS release/O2 consumed (Fig. 1). This finding suggests that even though CR yeast do not present more antioxidant defenses or increased resistance against exogenous oxidants (23Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), their redox balance is improved by lower levels of mitochondrial ROS release. The effects of CR on ROS release could be mimicked by artificially increasing respiration with uncouplers, whereas respiratory inhibition strongly enhanced ROS release, indicating the CR effect occurs as a result of respiratory stimulation. Yeast growth in 2% glucose represses the synthesis of electron transport chain components (23Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 34Schuller H.J. Curr. Genet. 2003; 43: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). As a result, electrons may accumulate at intermediate levels of the respiratory chain, favoring electron leakage and ROS formation. In CR yeast, glucose repression of mitochondrial respiration is reduced, stimulating electron transport and preventing ROS formation. In this manner, the effects of CR are similar to those of mild uncoupling that decreases mitochondrial ROS by enhancing respiration and preventing the accumulation of electrons at early steps of the transport chain where they can reduce oxygen monoelectronically, generating superoxide radical anions (11Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 12Starkov A.A. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To verify whether mild uncoupling was the cause of the beneficial effects of CR, we measured the effects of low concentrations of the uncoupler DNP on life span in S. cerevisiae. We initially studied chronological life span, which has been the focus of fewer studies in the area. We found that CR increases chronological life span in two yeast strains (W303–1A and BTY4741), indicating that chronological and replicative life spans share some common pathways (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the effects of CR could be mimicked by low doses of DNP, whereas respiratory inhibition decreased cell viability under these conditions, suggesting the CR effect is related to changes in respiration and ROS release promoted by this treatment. Because the deletion of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase also decreased cell viability, it seems chronological life span is limited by mitochondrial ROS production, as suggested previously (17Harris N. Costa V. MacLean M. Mollapour M. Moradas-Ferreira P. Piper P.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Longo V.D. Liou L.L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Further support for a role of mitochondrial metabolism in the determination of chronological life span was obtained by the finding that ΔRTG2, a mutant strain deficient in retrograde signaling, also displays reduced chronological life span. The deletion of this gene has previously been shown to affect replicative life span (25Borghouts C. Benguria A. Wawryn J. Jazwinski S.M. Genetics. 2004; 166: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), bringing further support for the existence of some common pathways in these processes (see Fig. 4). However, there are clear differences between the two mechanisms of aging in yeast. The null sir2 mutant, which still responds to the effects of CR on chronological life span (Fig. 3), represses the effect of CR on replicative life span (23Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). This result indicates chronological life span is not limited by ERC accumulation, as expected in a non-dividing cell. Further support for this notion was provided by the finding that a null mutant of PNC1, which affects NAD+/NADH levels and ERC accumulation (35Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J. Wood J.G. Medvedik O. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), displayed an increase in chronological life span similar to that observed in wild type cells when incubated under CR conditions (results not shown). Because mild uncoupling with DNP promoted the same respiratory, ROS, and chronological life span effects as CR, we tested its effects on replicative life span. The finding that DNP leads to an ∼15% increase in replicative life span indicates that mild uncoupling efficiently mimics CR (which increases replicative life span by ∼24% (21Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar)) and improves life span in both dividing cells and those in stationary phase. Based on our results, we propose a model which relates the effects of mitochondrial respiration and ROS release with chronological and replicative life span (Fig. 4). The finding that mild uncoupling, like CR, enhances both forms of life span suggests this may be a viable intervention to prevent aging in more complex organisms. Indeed, CR has been shown to promote a decrease in protonmotive force and ROS release in rats (36Lambert A.J. Merry B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: R71-R79Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, individual mice with longer life spans have larger respiratory rates and proton leaks (37Speakman J.R. Talbot D.A. Selman C. Snart S. McLaren J.S. Redman P. Krol E. Jackson D.M. Johnson M.S. Brand M.D. Aging Cell. 2004; 3: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that CR causes mild uncoupling that is responsible for the prevention of aging. Although the use of DNP as an uncoupler has many unwanted toxic effects, mammals contain naturally occurring pathways that lead to mild uncoupling, such as mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channels (38Ferranti R. da Silva M.M. Kowaltowski A.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and uncoupling proteins (39Negre-Salvayre A. Hirtz C. Carrera G. Cazenave R. Troly M. Salvayre R. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 40Talbot D.A. Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These pathways, when activated, decrease H2O2 release/O2 consumption ratios and could prove useful in further studies designed to establish a link between mild uncoupling and longevity.

Its expression is stimulated by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 treatment, the activation of BMP receptors and R-Smads, and the expression of Dlx5 and Runx2. However, how BMP-2 induces ALP expression is not clearly understood. We dissected the murine ALP promoter and found within it a Dlx5-binding cis-acting element by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and site-directed mutagenesis of the element. Dlx5 and the product of its target gene, Runx2, stimulated ALP promoter activity in an additive manner. However, because Dlx5 continued to stimulate ALP expression in Runx2–/– cells, the ALP stimulatory activity of Dlx5 is independent of Runx2. We also found that overexpression of Msx2 suppressed the mRNA level and enzyme activity of ALP that were induced by BMP-2 stimulation, and suppressed the Dlx5-stimulated ALP promoter activity by competing with Dlx5 for the cis-acting element in the ALP promoter. Moreover, Msx2 levels are constitutively high in C2C12 myogenic cells but decrease over time after BMP-2 treatment. This may explain why BMP-2 treatment of these cells results in immediate Dlx5 expression yet ALP expression commences only 1–2 days later. In other words, Msx2 in high levels counteracts initially the transcriptional activity of Dlx5 in low levels until a threshold Dlx5:Msx2 ratio is reached to the levels that allow the ALP stimulatory activity of Dlx5 to prevail. Thus, Dlx5 transactivates ALP expression, directly by binding to its cognate response element and/or indirectly by stimulating Runx2 expression, and Msx2 counteracts the direct transactivation of Dlx5.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP 1The abbreviations used are: ALP, alkaline phosphatase; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; HDRE, homeodomain-response element; Osx, osterix; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.; EC 3.1.3.1: orthophosphoricmonoester phosphohydrolase, alkaline optimum) was first suggested to be important in biomineralization by Robison in 1923 (1Robison R. Biochem. J. 1923; 17: 286-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this discovery, the role that it plays in osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization has been the subject of considerable research. Its function in ossification remains controversial but it is now known that the primary biological function of ALP in bone formation is associated with the calcification of the skeleton. This function is exerted either by its ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of organic phosphate esters, thereby providing inorganic phosphate, or by removing the inorganic pyrophosphate that inhibits calcification at the site of active mineralization. The ALP family is constituted by several isoenzymes that are encoded by four genes and named after the tissues in which they are predominantly expressed, namely, the intestinal (IntALP), placental (PALP), germ cell (GALP), and tissue nonspecific or kidney/bone/liver (TNSALP) isoenzymes. Of these, TNSALP is the major isoform that is expressed in osteoblasts (2Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan Q.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar) and it is widely accepted as a marker of differentiating osteoblasts both in vivo and in vitro. The ALP protein described in the text from this point onwards refers to this isoform. Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is one of the most potent bone-inducing agents in osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, it induces the osteogenic transdifferentiation of fibrogenic, myogenic, and adipogenic cells both in vitro and in vivo (3Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that BMP-2 treatment increases ALP mRNA expression and ALP activity (6Sakano S. Murata Y. Miura T. Iwata H. Sato K. Matsui N. Seo H. Clin. Orthop. 1993; 292: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Takuwa Y. Ohse C. Wang E.A. Wozney J.M. Yamashita K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, the osteogenic differentiation of various cells that is induced by BMP-2 treatment could be determined by measuring ALP activity or its mRNA expression. We have previously reported that Runx2 also plays an important role in the BMP-2-induced transdifferentiation of myogenic C2C12 cells into osteogenic cells (8Lee M.H. Javed A. Kim H.J. Shin H.I. Gutierrez S. Choi J.Y. Rosen V. Stein J.L. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Ryoo H.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 9Lee K.S. Kim H.J. Li Q.L.

Moreover, it was found that BMP-2 stimulates Runx2 mRNA expression in C2C12 cells and that the forced expression of Runx2 in C3H10T1/2 cells stimulates ALP promoter activity (10Harada H. Tagashira S.

Thus, it is speculated that ALP transcription is directly regulated by Runx2. However, the observation that ALP activity is still stimulated by BMP-2 in Runx2-deficient cells (11Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1997; 89: 755-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that there must be other upstream mediators that regulate the BMP-2-induced expression of ALP. We recently found that the homeobox gene Dlx5 is an indispensable upstream regulator of the expression of Runx2 that is generated by BMP signaling because of the following observations (12Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.J. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34387-34394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). First, the forced expression of Dlx5 stimulated Runx2 and ALP expression even in the absence of BMP-2 stimulation. Second, antisense blocking of Dlx5 completely abrogated BMP-2-induced stimulation of Runx2 and ALP expression. These observations suggest that Dlx5 enhances ALP expression by up-regulating Runx2 expression. In addition, we speculated a possibility that BMP-2-stimulated ALP expression may also be directly regulated by Dlx5 and this may even be the primary regulatory mechanism. In this paper, we dissected the 1.9-kb murine ALP promoter and found that it contains a Dlx5-response element, which indicates that ALP can indeed be directly targeted by Dlx5. We also found that the binding of Dlx5 to this element is important for BMP-2-induced ALP expression. Moreover, we examined the role of Msx2, another homeobox protein, in regulating Dlx5-induced ALP expression. Msx2 is thought to reverse the Dlx5-induced expression of osteoblast marker genes like osteocalcin by binding to Dlx5 rather than by competing with it for the same element on the target gene promoter (13Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16360-16368Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Shirakabe K. Terasawa K. Miyama K. Shibuya H. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, we found here that BMP-2-induced and Dlx5-mediated ALP expression is counteracted by Msx2 through its ability to compete with Dlx5 for the same cis-acting element on the ALP promoter. Materials—Bioactive recombinant human BMP-2 protein was from Wyeth, Inc. (Cambridge, MA) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, α-minimal essential medium, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. The Superscript™ first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription and LipofectAMINE Plus were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and Taq polymerase, the dNTP mixture, and G418 were from Promega (Madison, WI). The Megaprime DNA labeling system kit was from Amersham Biosciences and the Express hybridization solution was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The Zeta probe membrane was from Bio-Rad, whereas the cytochemical ALP staining kit was from Sigma. DNA Construction—The construction of the Dlx5 expression vector and Dlx5 antisense expression vector have been described previously (12Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M.

The mouse TNSALP promoter (–1838 bp) in the pGL3 basic vector was kindly provided by Dr. Hideyuki Harada (10Harada H. Tagashira S. Fujiwara M. Ogawa S. Katsumata T. Yamaguchi A. Komori T. Nakatsuka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6972-6978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). ALP promoter deletion constructs were generated by serial deletion from the 5′ end of the promoter by using restriction sites. Thus, the ALP-1838 promoter in the pGL3 basic vector was digested with NheI, SacI, SmaI, or PvuII, and HindIII to produce ALP-1488 (–1488 to +81 bp), ALP-1050 (–1050 to +81 bp), ALP-553 (–553 to +81 bp), or ALP-229 (–229 to +81 bp), respectively. Each deletion construct was then ligated into the corresponding restriction sites in the multiple cloning sites of the vector. To produce a construct that bears a mutation in the putative homeodomain-binding site, a site-directed mutagenic PCR was performed with the Mt1 forward oligonucleotides (see Fig. 3A for the sequence) and universal primer. The PCR product with the mutant binding site was digested with PstI and PvuII and substituted with the counterpart of wild type ALP-553. The construct was denoted Mt ALP (Mt). The FLAG-tagged Msx2 expression vector was constructed by subcloning the BamHI-XhoI fragment from pDS56-Msx2 (15Catron K.M. Wang H. Hu G. Shen M.M. Abate-Shen C. Mech. Dev. 1996; 55: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1-Flag. To produce the Msx2 antisense expression vector, antisense Msx2 DNA was subcloned into HindIII and BamHI of pcDNA3.1. Cell Culture and Determination of mRNA Levels and ALP Activity— Myogenic murine C2C12 cells and fibroblastic murine C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Runx2–/– cells from the primordium of calvarial tissue of Runx2-deficient mice (9Lee K.S. Kim H.J. Li Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. Bae S.C. Mol. Cell.

The cell maintenance protocol and the culture conditions used were as previously described (12Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.J. Ryoo H.M. J.

Total cellular RNA was extracted from the cells and its concentration was measured by spectrophotometry. RNA integrity was assessed by the ratio of 28/18 S ribosomal RNA after electrophoresis on 1% agarose, 5.5% formaldehyde gels. To determine the Dlx5, Msx2, and ALP mRNA levels, Northern blot analysis or reverse transcriptase-PCR were performed as previously described (12Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R.

Dlx5 and mouse GAPDH-specific primers were previously described (12Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.J. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol.

ALP activity was cytochemically determined by using an ALP staining kit. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The sequences of the wild type and mutant oligonucleotides used are listed in Fig. 3A. These double-stranded DNA probes were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. The Dlx5 and Msx2 proteins were produced by in vitro transcription and translation using TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate (Promega, Madison, WI). The Dlx5 and/or Msx2 proteins were incubated with the labeled, double-stranded DNA probes in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled competitor for 20 min at room temperature. For the supershift assay, the Dlx5 protein was preincubated with an anti-Dlx5 rabbit polyclonal antibody (12Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.J.

The protein-DNA complexes were then separated at 4 °C on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE buffer. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. After overnight culture, the cells were transfected with the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent. Each transfection assay was performed with 0.5 μg of the Dlx5,Msx2 expression vector or pcDNA3 and 0.5 μgofthe ALP-luciferase reporter vector. Three hours after transfection, the medium was changed and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. The cells were then harvested and luciferase activity was determined by using a Luciferase Assay kit (Promega). To establish Dlx5 overexpressing Runx2–/– cells that are stably transfected with Dlx5, Runx2–/– cells were transfected with the Dlx5 expression vector that had been cloned into the pcDNA3.1/Zeo expression vector. Stably transfected cell clones were selected with 800 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Dlx5 Overexpression Stimulates ALP Expression in a Runx2-independent Manner—It has been shown previously that the activation of the BMP signaling pathway by BMP-2 treatment or by overexpressing constitutively active BMP receptors or BMP-stimulated R-Smads strongly stimulates ALP activity (12Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.J. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34387-34394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We found here that BMP-2 treatment of C2C12 cells induced them to express both the ALP and Dlx5 mRNA (Fig. 1A). However, treating these cells with cycloheximide before introducing BMP-2 indicated that the expression of ALP requires de novo protein synthesis, whereas the Dlx5 gene is directly targeted by BMP signaling (Fig. 1A). Moreover, when Dlx5 was overexpressed by transfecting C2C12 cells with the Dlx5 expression vector, ALP expression was stimulated even in the absence of BMP-2 treatment (Fig. 1B). In addition, when C2C12 cells stably expressed Dlx5 antisense, BMP-2 treatment no longer stimulated ALP activity or stimulated it only very weakly (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, when Runx2–/– cells overexpressed Dlx5 because of their transfection with the Dlx5 expression vector, ALP activity was stimulated despite the lack of Runx2 (Fig. 1D). However, when Dlx5 and/or Runx2 were overexpressed in C2C12 cells along with the ALP promoter reporter construct, both transcription factors stimulated ALP promoter activity and the coexpression of both of the transcription factors had an additive effect (Fig. 1E). These observations together strongly suggest that (i) ALP is a downstream target of Dlx5, (ii) Dlx5 and Runx2 can both regulate ALP expression, and (iii) the stimulation of ALP expression by BMP-2 involves the positive regulation of these two transcription factors. Characterization of the Murine ALP Promoter and Identification of its Dlx5-response Element—To identify the Dlx5-response element(s) in the murine ALP promoter, we compared the murine and rat ALP promoters. The nucleotide sequences of the two promoters are highly conserved and both contain several transcription factor-response elements in the region between the –900 nucleotide and the putative transcription start site. A series of ALP promoter deletion constructs were constructed and introduction of these into various types of murine and rat non-osteogenic (Fig. 2, A and B) and osteogenic (Fig. 2, C and D) cells indicates that the smallest deletion construct, ALP-229, still bears minimal basal promoter activity. Moreover, the segment between nucleotides –1838 and –1050 of the ALP promoter seems to bear common enhancer elements for both the non-osteogenic and osteogenic cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, the region of the promoter between nucleotides –553 and –229 contains an element(s) that stimulates ALP promoter activity in osteoblast-like cells only (Fig. 2, C and D). Significantly, cotransfection of a non-osteogenic and an osteogenic cell line with the ALP-553 or ALP-229 promoter reporter construct along with the Dlx5 expression vector showed that Dlx5 overexpression significantly stimulated ALP-553 but could not stimulate ALP-229 (Fig. 2, E and F). These results suggest that there is a Dlx5-response element in the ALP promoter between nucleotides –553 and –229. Supporting this is that data base analysis indicates that there is a putative homeodomain-response element (HDRE) between nucleotides –486 and –483 that has the sequence ATTA. As ALP expression is stimulated by Dlx5, and an ALP promoter that contains the putative HDRE responded to Dlx5 overexpression, we checked whether Dlx5 can bind to the putative HDRE. To do this, an oligonucleotide bearing the ATTA sequence plus surrounding nucleotides (Fig. 3A) was synthesized, labeled, and used in an EMSA experiment with in vitro-translated Dlx5 protein. The labeled probe clearly bound to the Dlx5 protein, and this binding was diminished by a ×100 molar excess of the unlabeled probe (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Mutant probes were also constructed in which the ATTA sequence was wholly or partly mutated (Mt1, Mt2, and Mt3, Fig. 3A). However, these probes could not compete with the wild type probe for binding to Dlx5 (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–7). To confirm that the binding complex includes Dlx5, an EMSA supershift assay was performed by preincubating the Dlx5 protein with an anti-Dlx5 rabbit polyclonal antibody before adding it to the wild type oligonucleotide probe. The protein-DNA probe complex was supershifted by Dlx5 antibody (Fig. 3B, lane 8). We also found that mutation of the ATTA homeodomain-binding sequence in the ALP-553 promoter construct to CGAC (which generated Mt ALP) completely abrogated the ability of Dlx5 overexpression in C2C12 and Runx2–/– cells to stimulate the ALP promoter (Fig. 3, C and D). These observations indicate that the HDRE is indeed recognized and bound by Dlx5. Notably, mutation of the HDRE in the ALP-553 promoter construct strongly stimulated the basal ALP promoter activity. This suggests that there may be a strong negative regulator that can also bind to the Dlx5 response element and basally down-regulates ALP expression. Msx2 Antagonizes the Stimulatory Effect of Dlx5 on ALP Expression—We have noted repeatedly in previous reports that while BMP-2 strongly stimulates ALP mRNA expression, the expression of Dlx5 is immediate, whereas ALP expression takes place only 1–2 days later (5Skillington J. Choy L. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Lee K.S. Kim H.J. Li Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. Bae S.C.

Here we found that when we transfected C2C12 cells with the ALP-1838 or ALP-553 promoter constructs, treated them with BMP-2, and then analyzed their luciferase activities 24 h later, the ALP promoter was not activated at that time point (Fig. 4A). These observations strongly support the notion that there is a strong negative regulator that inhibits Dlx5 activity early after BMP2 treatment. We speculated that it may be Msx2, because Msx2 is widely known to be a Dlx5 antagonist (13Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16360-16368Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Shirakabe K. Terasawa K. Miyama K. Shibuya H. Nishida E.

Stein G.S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2631-2637PubMed Google Scholar) whose expression is stimulated by BMP-2. To assess this, we determined Msx2, Dlx5, and ALP expression over time after BMP-2 treatment (Fig. 4B). We found that Msx2 mRNA levels were very high even before BMP-2 treatment and that these levels were maintained up to 1 day later. However, after 3 days of culture, the Msx2 mRNA disappeared almost completely. With regard to Dlx5, however, it was not expressed before BMP-2 treatment but was first expressed 3 h later (Fig. 4B). These mRNA levels gradually increased over time and were still high 3 days after BMP-2 stimulation. ALP was not stimulated in the 3 h after BMP-2 treatment (at which point the Msx2 levels were high and the Dlx5 levels were low). Rather, ALP expression was stimulated only when the Msx2 levels were decreasing and Dlx5 levels were increasing (Fig. 4B). To confirm the negative action of Msx2 in the regulation of ALP expression, we stably transfected Msx2 sense or antisense expression vectors in C2C12 cells and established cell clones. Each cell clone was treated with BMP-2 and ALP activity was determined with cytochemical staining. Overexpression of Msx2 significantly suppressed BMP-2 stimulated ALP activity. On the contrary, antisense blocking of Msx2 slightly stimulated BMP-2-stimulated ALP activity (Fig. 4C). Consistent with these results, the stable transfection of Msx2 suppressed the BMP-2-induced ALP mRNA level and antisense increased the BMP-2-induced ALP mRNA level (Fig. 4D). In addition, when C2C12 cells were cotransfected with the ALP-1838, -1488, -553, or -229 promoter reporters together with the Msx2 expression vector, Msx2 could significantly suppress the baseline activity of ALP-1838, -1488, and -553 but it could not suppress ALP-229 activity (Fig. 4E). This suggests that Msx2, like Dlx5, may also recognize an element lying between nucleotides –229 and –553 of the ALP promoter. Supporting this repressive effect of Msx2 on ALP expression is that when C2C12 cells were transfected with the ALP-1838 promoter reporter together with the Dlx5 and/or Msx2 expression vectors, the stimulatory effect of Dlx5 was suppressed by Msx2 overexpression (Fig. 4F). To rule out the possibility that Runx2, which is secondarily induced by Dlx5 overexpression, may have an indirect effect, we examined the effect of overexpressing Dlx5 and/or Msx2 together with the ALP-1838 promoter reporter in Runx2–/– cells. Dlx5 and/or Msx2 overexpression had the same effect on the reporter that was observed in C2C12 cells (Fig. 4, F and G). We also found that mutating the HDRE in the ALP-553 promoter reporter abrogated the ability of Dlx5 and Msx2 to regulate its activity (Fig. 4H). Thus, Msx2 levels are constitutively high and decrease only 1 day after BMP-2 stimulation, at which point the increasing Dlx5 protein levels can stimulate ALP expression. Moreover, it appears that Msx2 may also recognize the same element in the ALP promoter that is bound by Dlx5. Msx2 Competes with Dlx5 for Binding to the HDRE in the ALP Promoter—Because our observations to date indicate that Msx2 inhibits the ability of Dlx5 to activate ALP transcription, the next question to be addressed was, what is the molecular mechanism by which Msx2 antagonizes Dlx5 activity? We examined this by performing EMSA in which the HDRE-containing labeled probe was incubated with a constant amount of Dlx5 or Msx2 and increasing levels of the counterpart protein (Fig. 5A). The binding of Dlx5 to the HDRE probe resulted in a single band (indicated by an arrowhead), whereas the binding of Msx2 to the HDRE probe resulted in two bands (indicated by two arrows), the upper of which was located at the same level as the Dlx5-probe complex. All bands were eliminated by competition from the cold competitor (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3 and 7 and 8). When more Msx2 protein was present, the formation of the Msx2-HDRE complexes was increased (Fig. 5A, lanes 4–6). In contrast, formation of the Msx2-HDRE binding complexes was decreased when increasing amounts of Dlx5 protein were added (Fig. 5A, lanes 9-11). Moreover, the levels of the supershifted Dlx5-HDRE-anti-Dlx5 antibody complex (asterisk) gradually decreased as the amount of the Msx2 protein that was added to the mixture were increased (Fig. 5B, lanes 3–6). Thus, Msx2 and Dlx5 can compete with each other for the HDRE in the ALP promoter. ALP has been widely accepted to be a faithful marker of osteoblast differentiation and BMP-2-induced osteogenic transdifferentiation of myogenic cells (2Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan Q.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar, 12Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.J. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34387-34394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which BMP-2 induces ALP transcription is still not clearly understood, although it is known that various BMP-2-induced transcription factors such as Runx2 and Dlx5 can regulate the ALP promoter. Here, we analyzed the murine ALP promoter and found that it contains a Dlx5-response element that is used to regulate BMP-2-induced ALP expression. Dlx5 Regulates ALP Expression by Binding Directly to the ALP Promoter—We showed previously that Dlx5 mediates BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation by stimulating two key master genes, namely, Runx2 and Osx (12Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.J. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol.

Commun. 2003; 309: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated that Dlx5 overexpression in Runx2–/– cells is sufficient to stimulate ALP mRNA expression. These observations together led us to propose that Dlx5 may directly regulate ALP expression. In this paper, we present evidence that strongly supports this notion because we located a Dlx5-response element in the ALP promoter and found that the binding of Dlx5 to this element is responsible for activating the ALP promoter. We also showed that blocking of Dlx5 expression abrogated BMP-2-induced ALP expression. These observations indicate that Dlx5 is a critical mediator of ALP expression. Dlx5 Stimulates ALP Expression in the Absence of Runx2— Whereas our previously published observations indicated that Dlx5 plays a critical role in BMP-2-induced ALP expression, it was not clear at that point whether Dlx5 directly up-regulates ALP expression or whether it does so through its ability to stimulate the expression of Runx2 (12Lee M.H.

https://openalex.org/W2098382903,"We report here that apelin (65-77) activates p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), not only in CHO cells that have been stably transfected with the apelin receptor, but also in umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC), which express it endogenously. Apelin (65-77) induces a time-dependent phosphorylation of p70S6K at residues T421/S424 and T389. This dual phosphorylation is associated with two transduction cascades, involving a PI3K pathway and an ERK pathway, respectively. The PI3K pathway, which can be blocked by wortmannin, leads to phosphorylation of Akt at residues T308 or S473, which then promotes the phosphorylation of p70S6K at T421/S424 and T389. The ERK pathway is blocked by PD 098059, a MEK inhibitor, and results in the phosphorylation of p70S6K at T421/S424. Phosphorylation both of Akt and p70S6K is abrogated by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) and an inhibitor of atypical PKCs. In addition, we demonstrate that apelin (65-77) also increases the enzymatic activity of p70S6K and that the effects of the previously mentioned inhibitors on the level of T389 phosphorylation correlate with their action on enzyme activity. Interestingly, the main findings were reproduced in umbilical endothelial cells and apelin (65-77) promoted thymidine incorporation into DNA of these cells, revealing that apelin is a new mitogenic peptide for the endothelial cell."

Previous overexpression and electrophoresis mobility shift analysis showed the involvement of the transcription factors ATF4, C/EBPβ, and ATF3-FL through the nutrient-sensing response element-1 (NSRE-1) within the ASNS promoter. Amino acid deprivation caused an elevated mRNA level for ATF4, C/EBPβ, and ATF3-FL, and the present study established that the nuclear protein content for ATF4 and ATF3-FL were increased during amino acid limitation, whereas C/EBPβ-LIP declined slightly. The total amount of C/EBPβ-LAP protein was unchanged, but changes in the distribution among multiple C/EBPβ-LAP forms were observed. Overexpression studies established that ATF4, ATF3-FL, and C/EBPβ-LAP could coordinately modulate the transcription from the human ASNS promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that amino acid deprivation increased ATF3-FL, ATF4, and C/EBPβ binding to the ASNS promoter and enhanced promoter association of RNA polymerase II, TATA-binding protein, and TFIIB of the general transcription machinery. A time course revealed a markedly different temporal order of interaction between these transcription factors and the ASNS promoter. During the initial 2 h, there was a 20-fold increase in ATF4 binding and a rapid increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation, which closely paralleled the increased transcription rate of the ASNS gene, whereas the increase in ATF3-FL and C/EBPβ binding was considerably slower and more closely correlated with the decline in transcription rate between 2 and 6 h. The data suggest that ATF3-FL and C/EBPβ act as transcriptional suppressors for the ASNS gene to counterbalance the transcription rate activated by ATF4 following amino acid deprivation.

Mammalian cells have evolved complex cellular responses to changes in environment, including nutrient availability.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38402-38412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Jiang et al. (17Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Lu D. Hai T. Harding H.P. Wang X. Ron D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the expression of ATF3 is induced in response to amino acid deprivation or to ER stress, by mechanisms requiring the eIF-2α kinases GCN2 and PERK, respectively. Pan et al. (4Pan Y.-X. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38402-38412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) also documented that histidine deprivation leads to alternative splicing of ATF3 such that an mRNA encoding a truncated ATF3 protein is favored. C/EBPβ is a member of a transcription factor family, including C/EBPα, β, γ, δ, ϵ, and CHOP. C/EBPβ is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, such as cellular proliferation, carbohydrate metabolism, adipocyte differentiation, and inflammation (18Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Marten et al. (19Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Marten N.W. Sladek F.M. Straus D.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that the mRNA content of C/EBPβ is increased by amino acid deprivation. Subsequently, Siu et al. (5Siu F.Y. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that not only is C/EBPβ mRNA increased by histidine deprivation of HepG2 hepatoma cells, but there is also increased DNA binding activity for C/EBPβ in the nuclear extract. The present study was designed to further investigate the expression levels of ATF4, ATF3, and C/EBPβ protein following amino acid limitation and to establish the temporal interactions of ATF4, ATF3, and C/EBPβ with the ASNS promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. Furthermore, we have observed that a change of histone acetylation status occurs within the ASNS promoter region when the gene is activated following amino acid deprivation. Reversible acetylation of nucleosomal core histones is correlated with changes in chromatin during transcription. Specifically, actively transcribed genes are commonly featured by hyperacetylation of histones H3 and/or H4 tails located within their promoter regions (21Schubeler D. MacAlpine D.M. Scalzo D. Wirbelauer C. Kooperberg C. van Leeuwen F. Gottschling D.E. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Delrow J. Bell S.P. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1263-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Using ChIP analysis, a time course of following amino acid limitation revealed a rapid increase, within 45 min, in ATF4 binding and acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Together with the association of the general transcription initiation complex, these changes closely paralleled the increase in transcription rate from the ASNS gene. Subsequently, there was increased binding of ATF3-FL and C/EBPβ to the ASNS promoter, which occurred between 2 and 4 h and was more closely associated with the decline in transcription rate. The results demonstrate that following amino acid limitation there is a sequential order of association for a number of important bZIP transcription factors that bind to the ASNS promoter NSRE-1 site and that this factor binding is accompanied by modification of chromatin. Antibodies—The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA): ATF1, sc-270; ATF2, sc-187; ATF3, sc-188; ATF4, sc-200; C/EBPα, sc-61; C/EBPβ, sc-150; C/EBPδ, sc-636; C/EBPϵ, sc-158; Sp1, sc-59; Sp3, sc-644; TFIIB, sc-274; TBP, sc-273; RNA polymerase II, sc-899; TAFII250, sc-17134; CBP, sc-369; GCN5, sc-6302; p300, 584; and PCAF, sc-8999. Acetylated histone H3, 06–599 (specific for acetylated Lys-9 and Lys-14) and acetylated histone H4, 06-866 (recognizes acetylated H4 at Lys4, -7, -11, and -15) antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Cell Culture—Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM, pH 7.4, Mediatech, Herndon, VA), supplemented to contain 1× non-essential amino acids, 4 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air incubator. Given that ASNS promoter activity is induced by nutrient depletion, cell cultures were replenished with fresh MEM medium and serum for 12 h prior to initiating all treatments to ensure that the cells were in the basal (“fed”) state. Amino acid deprivation was performed by incubating the cells for 12 h in complete MEM or MEM lacking histidine, each containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. RNA Isolation and Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen). For each sample, 2 μg of RNA was dried and resuspended in RNase-free H2O to make a final concentration of 200 ng/μl. To measure the relative amount of ASNS mRNA, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed using a DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (MJ Research, Reno, NV) and detection with SYBR Green I. The primers for amplification were: sense primer, 5′-GCAGCTGAAAGAAGCCCAAGT-3′ and antisense primer, 5′-TGTCTTCCATGCCAATTGCA-3′. The reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 15 min to activate the Taq polymerase and amplification of 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 60 s. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increase of the temperature from 55 °C to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. L7a mRNA level was also measured at the same time as the internal control. The primers for amplification were: sense primer, 5′-TTTGGCATTGGACAGGACATCC-3′; and antisense primer, 5′-AGCGGGGCCATTTCACAAAG-3′. PCR was done in duplicates with samples from at least three independent experiments, and the means ± the standard error of the means between conditions were compared by Students t test. Transcription Rate Determination—Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen), including DNase I treatment before final elution to eliminate any DNA contamination. To measure the transcription rate from the ASNS gene, oligonucleotides derived from ASNS intron 12 and exon 13 were used to measure unspliced transcript (pre-mRNA). This procedure for measuring transcription rate is based on that described by Lipson and Baserga (22Lipson K.E. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9774-9777Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), except that pre-mRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Reactions without reverse transcriptase were performed as a negative control to rule out any amplification from any residual genomic DNA. These tests were always negative. The primers for amplification were: sense primer, 5′-CCTGCCATTTTAAGCCATTTTGC-3′; and antisense primer, 5′-TGGGCTGCATTTGCCATCATT-3′. The reactions were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 15 min to activate the Taq polymerase and amplification of 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 58 °C for 60 s. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increase of the temperature from 55 to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. Immunoblotting—Total cell extracts or nuclear extracts were prepared at the time points indicated, and 30 μg/sample was separated on a 4–20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) or a standard 20-cm 10% gel (for C/EBPβ) and then electrotransferred to a Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was stained with Fast Green to check for equal loading and then incubated with 10% blocking solution (10% (w/v) Carnation nonfat dry milk, 30 mm Tris-Base, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 200 mm NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature with mixing. Immunoblotting was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ATF3-FL, ATF4, or C/EBPβ (all isoforms) at an antibody concentration of 0.2–0.4 μg/ml in 10% dry milk blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature (∼21 °C). The blots were washed 5 × 5 min in 5% blocking solution on a shaker and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a 1:20,000 dilution for 45 min at room temperature. The blots were then washed for 5 × 5 min in 5% dry milk blocking solution and 2 × 5 min in freshly made TBS/Tween (30 mm Tris-base, 0.1% Tween 20, and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The bound secondary antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposing the blot to BioMax MR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). Transient Transfection and Expression—The reporter plasmid (ASNS–173/+51/luc) was made by inserting the ASNS promoter region (nt –173/+51) upstream of the Firefly luciferase reporter gene using the HindIII site of the pGL3 plasmid (Promega, Madison WI). The expression of the rat ATF4 cDNA (provided by Dr. Jawed Alam, Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, New Orleans, LA), ATF3-FL cDNA (provided by Dr. Tsonwin Hai at The Ohio State University), and C/EBPβ-LAP cDNA (provided by Dr. U. Schibler via Dr. Harry S. Nick, University of Florida) was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. HepG2 cells (0.2 × 106 cells/well) were seeded on 24-well plates 18–24 h before transfection with Superfect reagent (Qiagen) at a ratio of 6 μl of Superfect to 1 μg of DNA. For each transfection, 0.5 μg of the ASNS–173/+51/luc plasmid was used along with the indicated amounts of the transcription factor expression plasmids. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant among experimental groups by the addition of empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid. Eighteen hours following transfection, the cells were transferred to fresh complete MEM for 12 h before preparing cellular extracts for analysis of luciferase activity. To prepare the extract, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 100 μl of Passive Lysis buffer supplied by Promega. The lysates were collected and stored at –80 °C until use. Twenty microliters of cell extract was used for Firefly luciferase assays using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), and the luminescence was measured with a luminometer. The luciferase values are normalized to microgram protein content for each sample. For each experimental condition, four to six assays were performed for each transfection and at least three independent transfections were done. ChIP Analysis—ChIP analysis was performed according to a modified protocol of Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Charlottesville, VA). Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 107/150-mm dish with complete MEM and grown for 24 h. Cells were transferred to fresh MEM 12 h before transfer to either complete MEM or MEM lacking histidine (MEM-His) for the time period indicated in each figure. Protein-DNA was cross-linked by adding formaldehyde directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1% and then stopped 10 min later by adding 2 m glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cross-linked chromatin was solubilized by sonication using a Sonic Dismembrator (Model 60, Fisher Scientific Co.) for five bursts of 40 s at power 10 with 2-min cooling on ice between each burst. Extract from 1 × 107 HepG2 cells was incubated with 2 μg of antibody. A rabbit anti-chicken IgG was used as the nonspecific antibody control. The antibody-bound complex was precipitated by protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA fragments in the immunoprecipitated complex were released by reversing the cross-linking at 65 °C for 5 h and purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified, immunoprecipitated DNA was first analyzed by PCR and visualized by ethidium bromide staining after gel electrophoresis. Primers used for the regular PCR were: forward primer (human ASNS–173), 5′-CAAAAGAGCTCCTCCTTG; and reverse primer (human ASNS +51), 5′-TAAGCAGGTCAGGGTGAT. The results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) with primers (5′-TGGTTGGTCCTCGCAGGCAT-3′ and 5′-CGCTTATACCGACCTGGCTCCT-3′) designed using Vector NTI version 7.1 software (InforMax Inc., Frederick, MD) to amplify the ASNS proximal promoter sequence nt –87 to –22 (5′-TGGTTGGTCCTCGCAGGCATGATGAAACTTCCCGCACGCGTTACAGGAGCCAGGTCGGTATAAGCG-3′, NSRE-1 and NSRE-2 are underlined). The qPCR analysis was performed using the DNA Engine Opticon 2 system and detected with SYBR Green I. Serial dilutions of input chromatin were used to generate a standard curve for determining the relative amount of product. Duplicates for both the standards and the samples were simultaneously amplified using the same reaction master mixture. The reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 15 min to activate the polymerase, followed by amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and 61.4 °C for 60 s for 35 cycles. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increases in the temperature from 55 to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. The results are expressed as the ratio to input DNA. Samples from at least three independent immunoprecipitations were analyzed, and the means ± S.E. of the means between conditions were compared by the Students t test. Effect of Amino Acid Deprivation on ASNS mRNA Synthesis and Turnover—Although it is known that the ASNS mRNA content of cells is increased after 12 h of amino acid limitation, a longer period of study is necessary to determine if this increase is transient. Consequently, HepG2 human hepatoma cells were incubated in histidine-free MEM for 0–24 h and the mRNA level for ASNS was measured for three independent experiments by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1A). An initial increase in ASNS mRNA content was observed after 2 h of histidine deprivation and then reached a maximum of about 15-times the control value at 12 h. Although there was a trend of decline from 12 to 24 h, the level was still elevated by 10-times the control. Although it has been documented that increased transcription contributes to the increase in ASNS mRNA (2Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Gong et al. (23Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that amino acid limitation also caused the increased stability of ASNS mRNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells. To evaluate whether mRNA stabilization contributes to the increase in ASNS mRNA in HepG2 cells, they were incubated in MEM without histidine for 12 h to elevate ASNS mRNA content and then transferred to either fresh histidine-free MEM or complete MEM, both containing 5 μm actinomycin D (Fig. 1B). ASNS RNA content was assayed by qRT-PCR, and the rate of decay was analyzed graphically. It was clear that the rate of mRNA turnover was not different in the presence or absence of histidine, and in both conditions, the estimated mRNA half-life was ∼20 h. These results indicate that amino acid deprivation of HepG2 cells does not elevate the ASNS mRNA content by increasing mRNA stability. To investigate the change in the transcription rate of the ASNS gene, the levels of unspliced ASNS pre-mRNA were measured. Given that introns are rapidly removed from hnRNA during splicing, this procedure is a measure of transcription, similar to the data obtained by nuclear run-on analysis (22Lipson K.E. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9774-9777Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were incubated in histidine-free MEM for 0–24 h for a long time course and for 0–2 h for a shorter time course. qRT-PCR analysis of ASNS pre-mRNA with specific primers spanning an intron-exon junction was used to amplify a transient intermediate. In the long time course (Fig. 1C), an increase in ASNS transcription rate was observed after 2 h of histidine deprivation, which reached a maximum of about 20-times the control value. There was a gradual decline from 2 to 24 h, although even after 24 h the level was still elevated compared with the control. When the first 2 h were examined (Fig. 1D), it was determined that the ASNS transcription rate started to increase after 45 min of histidine limitation and escalated to a maximum of 20-times the control value at 2 h. ATF3-FL, ATF4, and C/EBPβ Protein Content Responds to Amino Acid Limitation—To establish the kinetics of ATF4, ATF3-FL, or C/EBPβ protein content after amino acid limitation, whole cell extracts from control (MEM-incubated) or histidine-deprived HepG2 cells were subjected to immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Amino acid deprivation caused an elevation of both ATF4 and ATF3-FL proteins (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with the recognized translational control of ATF4 by amino acid availability (7Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar, 8Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), ATF4 protein content was significantly increased by 2 h (Fig. 2, A and B), peaked at 4 h, and then declined gradually over the next 20 h to the control level. In contrast, the peak of ATF3-FL protein expression was later and occurred at 8 h, but stayed relatively high for the remainder of the 24-h period investigated (Fig. 2, A and B). The changes in C/EBPβ protein composition were complex. The C/EBPβ mRNA encodes three possible proteins, LAP*, LAP, and LIP depending on translational initiation at one of three methionine codons that exist within the sequence. LAP* and LAP are two different forms of “liver activating protein,” whereas LIP, “liver inhibitory protein,” is a truncated isoform that serves as a naturally occurring dominant negative (24Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The predicted molecular masses are 36, 33.5, and 16.5 kDa for the human proteins, respectively, although they are known to run anomalously on SDS-PAGE and are subject to post-translational modification (18Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Buck M. Chojkier M. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To provide a standard reference, a human cDNA beginning with the second methionine codon was expressed in HepG2 cells, and thus, should yield only the LAP and LIP isoforms. Upon immunoblotting with an antibody that will recognize all C/EBPβ isoforms, the LAP protein was detected as a series of at least three bands at ∼40–45 kDa (data not shown). An immunoreactive band corresponding to LIP (∼17 kDa) was observed only when the blot was developed for a longer period, consistent with a reported lower rate of initiation at the last methionine codon (26Sears R.C. Sealy L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 14: 4855-4871Crossref Google Scholar). The endogenous C/EBPβ-LAP migrated as a series of bands that corresponded to those obtained with the overexpressed standard (Fig. 2C, bands A–C). The most intensive band detected in the control cells (MEM) actually decreased slightly during the course of histidine deprivation (Fig. 2C, LAP-B band). However, the band above (A Band) and the band below (C Band) the band B were increased in abundance following amino acid limitation. Although the absolute amount of these protein forms was less than band B, the relative increase was significant (Fig. 2D). The molecular basis for this heterogeneity remains to be established, but C/EBPβ is known to be the target of post-translational modification (18Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Buck M. Chojkier M. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To det"

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species regulate NRG/erbB signaling. We used isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) or cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) in monoculture, or together in coculture. H2O2 induced NRG-1β release from CMECs in a concentration-dependent manner, and conditioned medium from H2O2-treated CMEC activated ARVM erbB4. NRG-1β release occurred via proteolytic cleavage of 115-kDa transmembrane NRG-1β and was inhibited by the metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. In myocyte monoculture, H2O2 induced erbB4-dependent, but NRG-independent, activation of Akt. To elucidate the bioactivity of CMEC-derived NRG-1β on ARVMs, we examined H2O2-induced myocyte apoptosis in co-culture using an antibody to NRG-1β. The percentages of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells were significantly higher in the anti-NRG-1β group than in the control group. The change in apoptosis induced by anti-NRG-1β in co-culture was similar in magnitude to the protection of myocytes by addition of recombinant NRG-1β to ARVM monocultures. Activation of NRG/erbB paracrine signaling was also seen in the intact heart subjected to oxidative stress by ischemia-reperfusion injury. Isolated perfused mouse hearts subjected to 15 min of ischemia, followed by 30 min of reperfusion, showed complete proteolytic cleavage of 115-kDa NRG-1β, with concomitant erbB4 phosphorylation.

This prosurvival effect of NRG-1β occurs through the activation of erbB2 and erbB4 receptor tyrosine kinases in myocytes with downstream signaling in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt pathway.

These observations suggest that the NRG/erbB pathway acts as a stress-responsive signal between CMECs and myocytes to maintain cell survival and cardiac function. We have cloned eight isoforms of NRG-1β from CMECs isolated from adult rat heart and found that the majority of NRG-1β expressed is transmembrane protein (13Cote G.M. Miller T.A. Sawyer D.B. FASEB J. 2001; 15: A762Google Scholar). In cultured cell lines, proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane NRG occurs via one or more members of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family (14Falls D.L. Exp.

In skeletal muscle, physiological stress, such as exercise, is a potent activator of NRG shedding and erbB signaling (17Lebrasseur N.K. Cote G.M. Miller T.A. Fielding R.A. Sawyer D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1149-C1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the conditions that regulate proteolysis and activation of NRG in the heart remain unknown. Because myocyte injury is often a result of oxidative stress (18Zhou S.Y. Palmeira C.M. Wallace K.B. Toxicol. Lett. 2001; 121: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 19Remondino A.

Hypertension. 2002; 40: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that NRG/erbB signaling in the heart is redox sensitive and may in part protect the heart under such condition. To test this hypothesis, we used adult rat ventricular myocyte (ARVMs) in monoculture, as well as ARVMs co-cultured with CMECs as the source of NRG. Interestingly, we found that H2O2 was able to activate ARVM erbB4/Akt signaling via induction of NRG-1β paracrine signaling, as well as NRG-independent direct activation via erbB4. Furthermore, using a NRG-1β antibody, we demonstrated that CMEC-derived NRG-1β is protective against H2O2-stimulated ARVM apoptosis. We further observed that ischemia-reperfusion in the intact heart, in which ROS are generated, induced NRG-1β/erbB4 activation, thereby implicating NRG-1β/erbB4 signaling in the modulation of myocardial injury in the setting of oxidative stress. Chemicals—The recombinant neuregulin-1β (glial growth factor 2) was courtesy of Mark Machionni (Cambridge Neuroscience, Inc, Arlington, MA). Human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem. Cell Preparation and Culture—ARVMs and CMECs were isolated as reported previously (21Communal C. Singh K. Pimentel D.R. Colucci W.S.

ARVMs were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with ACCT (albulmin (2 g/l), l-carnitine (0.4 g/l), creatine (0.66 g/l), and taurine (0.62 g/l)) (9Kuramochi Y. Lim C.C.

In all experiments, confluent CMECs were used. Two forms of co-culture were studied. For direct co-culture, ARVMs were plated on monolayer CMECs (previously plated and grown to confluence) at the densities of 50–100 myocytes/mm2 and were maintained in ACCT medium. For terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, ARVMs and CMECs were separated by using cell culture inserts. CMECs were plated on the cell culture inserts incorporating polyethylene terephthalate tracketched membrane (Becton Dickinson), grown to confluence in 20% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and placed in 6-well plates with ARVMs. Ischemia-Reperfusion of Isolated Mouse Heart—Hearts were isolated from mice and perfused in the Langendorff mode. After 15 min of stabilization, hearts were subjected to 15 min of zero-flow ischemia, followed by 10 or 30 min of reperfusion as described previously (23Jain M. Cui L. Brenner D.A. Wang B. Handy D.E.

Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Antibodies targeting the common extracellular domain (Ab-1) and carboxy terminus (C-20) of NRG were purchased from NeoMarkers and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Anti-NRG-1β was raised against the sequence NH2-DRC-QNYVMASFY-COOH (polyclonal chicken IgY, contracted to Lampire Biological Laboratories, Inc). Equal volumes of CMEC culture medium and mouse heart perfusion buffer were condensed using Centriplus (Millipore) for immunoprecipitation of NRG. For subcellular fractionation, CMECs were homogenized in 4 °C HES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 250 mm sucrose, and 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors. Homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 25 min. The resulting supernatant was sonicated and again centrifuged at 700 × g. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in modified RIPA buffer and designated as the membrane fraction, whereas the supernatant was designated as the cytosol fraction. Activation of erbB4, erbB2, Akt, Erk1/2, JNK, and p38 were determined using total cell lysate of ARVMs by immunoprecipitation or immunoblot as described previously (7Zhao Y.Y. Sawyer D.R. Baliga R.R.

One-way analysis of variance was used for multiple comparisons, with Bonferroni post-test analysis. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. H2O2 Activates erbB4 via Direct and Paracrine Mechanisms—We examined myocyte erbB4 phosphorylation in response to H2O2 stimulation using ARVMs in monoculture and in co-culture with CMECs. ErbB4 was activated by H2O2 in both culture systems. Because erbB4 is not expressed in CMECs (7Zhao Y.Y. Sawyer D.R. Baliga R.R. Opel D.J. Han X.Q. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10261-10269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 24Fukazawa R. Ogawa S.I. Frantz S. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. Sawyer D.B. Circulation. 2000; 102 (abstr.): 138Google Scholar), this is indicative of ARVM erbB4 activation. In co-culture, erbB4 was phosphorylated at [H2O2]100μM (Fig. 1A), whereas in ARVM monoculture, this was not detectable below [H2O2]300μM (Fig. 1B). To examine whether CMEC augmentation of H2O2-induced erbB4 phosphorylation requires cell contact between ARVMs and CMECs, or occurs via release of erbB4 ligand, ARVM monoculture was treated with the culture medium from H2O2-exposed ARVMs, CMEC monoculture, or ARVM/CMEC co-culture, respectively. Cells were treated with H2O2 for 15 min. Medium was removed, and H2O2 was quenched with manganese dioxide before addition of the medium into ARVM plate (25Koppenol W.H. Kissner R. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 296-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ARVMs were lysed 15 min after treatment, and erbB4 activation was examined. ErbB4 was markedly phosphorylated when ARVMs were incubated with H2O2-treated CMEC medium (Fig. 1C). In contrast, erbB4 activation was not detected after treatment with ARVM-conditioned medium nor CMEC control medium. These results suggest that H2O2 stimulation triggers CMEC-ARVM communication through paracrine signaling mechanism. H2O2 Exposure Regulates NRG Release from CMECs— Among erbB4 ligands (26Holbro T. Hynes N.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 195-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), NRG-1β is known to be expressed in CMECs (7Zhao Y.Y. Sawyer D.R. Baliga R.R. Opel D.J. Han X.Q. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10261-10269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether NRG-1β is released from CMECs by H2O2 stimulation. We examined the effect of H2O2 on CMEC NRG-1 protein processing using three distinct NRG antibodies. The effect of H2O2 on full-length NRG-1 in CMECs and shed NRG in medium were studied. All antibodies showed immunoreactivity mainly to 60- and 115-kDa proteins in CMEC lysate. We have confirmed, using RNA interference, that this 115-kDa protein is a NRG-1 gene product 2G. M. Cote, submitted for publication. and is immunoreactive with antibodies to both extra- and intracellular NRG-1. To minimize nonspecific protein detection, we performed immunoprecipitation with Ab-1, followed by the immunoblot with other NRG antibodies. Immunodetectable low molecular weight (∼30-kDa) NRG-1β in culture medium increased in proportion to H2O2 concentration (Fig. 2A), whereas high molecular weight (115-kDa) NRG (both total NRG-1 and NRG-1β) band, which was detected in the membrane fraction, disappeared from CMEC lysates in response to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2, B and C). To show that this was not attributable to protein degradation by H2O2, total actin and erbB2 were blotted with using the same CMEC lysates. ADAM17 and 19 are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) reported to mediate NRG shedding in 293 and L929 cells (15Shirakabe K. Wakatsuki S. Kurisaki T. Fujisawa-Sehara A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9352-9358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Montero J.C. Yuste L. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Esparis-Ogando A. Pandiella A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 631-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To test the role of MMPs in H2O2-induced NRG-1β processing, we preincubated CMECs with the nonspecific MMP inhibitor GM6001 or 1,10-phenanthroline, followed by H2O2 treatment. NRG-1β processing was partially inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline at [H2O2]100μM, whereas the effect of GM6001 was not statistically significant. At 300 μm, neither treatment inhibited NRG processing (Fig. 2, B and C). H2O2-triggered NRG-1β Release from CMECs Suppresses ARVM Apoptosis—The survival effect of NRG-1β derived from CMECs was studied using affinity-purified polyclonal anti-NRG-1β as a tool to block the action of endogenous NRG-1β. This was compared with the effect of recombinant NRG-1β on ARVM survival. In ARVM monoculture, pretreatment of ARVMs with recombinant NRG-1β suppressed H2O2-induced apoptosis. This prosurvival effect of recombinant NRG-1β was partial at [H2O2]50μM and not seen at 100 μm (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase by LY294002 reversed this cytoprotective effect. In co-cultured ARVMs, anti-NRG-1β preincubation, followed by H2O2 treatment, increased the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells, and this effect was seen at both [H2O2]50μM and [H2O2]100μM (Fig. 3, B and C). At these concentrations, H2O2 did not induce cell necrosis, as assessed by trypan blue uptake, in either culture system (data not shown). H2O2-activated erbB4-Akt Signaling Independent of NRG— H2O2 induced erbB4 phosphorylation at 300 μm in ARVM monoculture (Fig. 1B). Because NRG is not expressed in myocytes (7Zhao Y.Y. Sawyer D.R. Baliga R.R. Opel D.J. Han X.Q. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10261-10269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and ARVM conditioned medium did not induce ARVM erbB4 activation (Fig. 1C), this result suggests that ROS can activate erbB4 via a NRG-independent pathway. H2O2 (10–1000 μm) activates multiple intracellular stress response kinase cascades, including members of the erbB family receptor tyrosine kinases (27Wei S. Rothstein E.C. Fliegel L. Dell'Italia L.J. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1542-C1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kwon S.H. Pimentel D.R. Remondino A. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. J. Mol. Cell.

Res. 2002; 53: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, myocyte apoptosis and the prosurvival effect of NRG-1β in co-culture were observed from [H2O2]50μM, whereas erbB4 phosphorylation was detectable only at [H2O2] ≥ 100 μm. We considered that these results might be attributable to the relatively insensitive method for the detection of erbB4 receptor kinase activity at low [H2O2]μM and hypothesized that this NRG-independent pathway was also activated even at low H2O2 concentrations. To test this, we used pharmacological erbB inhibitor and examined the erbB4-induced stress kinase signaling at [H2O2]50μM. The tyrphostin AG1478 was developed as an EGFR (erbB1) inhibitor but also blocks other erbB receptors including erbB4 (8Fukazawa R. Miller T.A. Kuramochi Y. Frantz S. Kim Y.D. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. Sawyer D.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We found that H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Akt was blocked by AG1478 at 5 μm without affecting the Erk1/2, JNK, or p38 pathway (Fig. 4A). To discern whether the effect of AG1478 on H2O2-induced Akt activation was occurring through inhibition of erbB4 versus EGFR, we examined the concentration dependence of AG1478 on NRG-1β/erbB2/4 and EGF/EGFR signaling. The NRG-1β/erbB2/4-Akt pathway was inhibited by 5 μm AG1478 (Fig. 4, B and C). Consistent with previous reports (8Fukazawa R. Miller T.A. Kuramochi Y. Frantz S. Kim Y.D. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. Sawyer D.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), 0.5 μm AG1478 was sufficient to suppress EGF-induced Akt (Fig. 4D) as well as EGFR phosphorylation (data not shown). In marked contrast to NRG-1β signaling, EGF induced little Akt activation, except at very high concentrations (200 ng/ml). Collectively, these results suggest that H2O2-induced Akt activation occurs via erbB4 receptor kinase activity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that H2O2-induced Akt phosphorylation occurred via some other AG1478-inhibitable kinase. NRG-1β Processing and erbB4 Activation in the Intact Heart in Response to Ischemia-Reperfusion—Ischemia-reperfusion is well-known to induce tissue oxidative stress injury. We therefore examined whether ischemia-reperfusion activates NRG-1β processing and erbB4 phosphorylation. Buffer-perfused mouse hearts were subjected to global ischemia (15 min) and reperfusion (10 and 30 min). Lysates from hearts subjected to ischemia plus 30 min of reperfusion showed marked reduction of the 115-kDa NRG-1β (Fig. 5), similar to CMECs treated with H2O2 (Fig. 2B). In the hearts reperfused for 30 min, there was evidence for increased phosphorylation of erbB4 (Fig. 5), consistent with NRG-1β processing to an active ligand. Thus, ischemia-reperfusion is able to activate NRG-1β/erbB4 signaling in the intact heart. Moreover, NRG-1β was present in the perfusion coronary effluent, even at baseline, and increased after ischemia-reperfusion. NRG-1β is expressed in CMECs, and recombinant neuregulin-1β can regulate growth, survival, and contractility of cardiomyocytes in vitro (7Zhao Y.Y. Sawyer D.R. Baliga R.R. Opel D.J. Han X.Q.

Circulation. 2004; 109: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our present work extends previous observations to demonstrate that NRG-1β is released from CMECs under conditions of oxidative stress and regulates the survival of cardiac myocytes in a co-culture system. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence that NRG-1β functions via a paracrine mechanism triggered by ROS in the heart. Furthermore, our analysis of NRG-1β and erbB4 phosphorylation in the intact heart shows the possibility that this system is also activated by in vivo oxidative stress. Collectively, NRG-1β/erbB4 signaling is one form of CMEC/myocyte paracrine signaling that appears to be an adaptive response to myocardial stress. Proteolytic processing of NRG-1β and release from CMECs appears to be the proximal step for activation of NRG/erbB signaling in the heart. This phenomenon occurred with an [H2O2] of 50 μm. We observed NRG shedding within 15 min, before any alteration in actin protein expression. Moreover, processed NRG showed bioactivity as a prosurvival factor. Because 50 μm H2O2 can induce endothelial cell death (31De Bono D.P. Yang W.D. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 114: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), endothelial cell injury may be the proximal trigger for NRG/erbB paracrine signaling. Conceptually, this result is different from what we have observed in skeletal muscle, where physiologic stress (e.g. exercise) is a potent activator of NRG/erbB signaling (17Lebrasseur N.K. Cote G.M. Miller T.A. Fielding R.A. Sawyer D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1149-C1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similar to what we have reported previously for β-adrenergic receptor and daunorubicin-induced apoptosis (8Fukazawa R. Miller T.A. Kuramochi Y. Frantz S. Kim Y.D. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. Sawyer D.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1473-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 9Kuramochi Y. Lim C.C. Guo X.X. Colucci W.S. Liao R.L. Sawyer D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C222-C229Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), recombinant NRG-1β inhibited H2O2-induced myocyte apoptosis in a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-dependent manner. When comparing the effect of recombinant NRG-1β in monoculture (Fig. 3A) to the effect of anti-NRG-1β in co-culture (Fig. 3C), it appears that CMEC-derived NRG-1β has equal potency to recombinant NRG-1β at [H2O2]50μM and that the antibody used in these studies is able to completely block NRG-1β bioactivity. Interestingly, both NRG release from CMECs and ARVM apoptosis occurred from H2O2 exposure at 50 μm. Thus, cytoprotective NRG-1β/erbB4 signaling is activated at a cytotoxic concentration of ROS, suggesting that this system has evolved to respond to and modulate myocardial stress. Our data indicate that CMECs have both an ROS-sensing mechanism as well as the protease necessary to respond to ROS with NRG activation. The NRG-1β processing in CMECs appears to occur via activation of a member of the MMP family, because it is partially inhibited by the nonspecific MMP inhibitor, 1,10-phenanthroline. The ADAM family of MMPs has been implicated in NRG processing in other systems (15Shirakabe K. Wakatsuki S. Kurisaki T. Fujisawa-Sehara A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9352-9358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Montero J.C. Yuste L. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Esparis-Ogando A. Pandiella A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 631-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ADAM17 and ADAM19 knock-out animals, such as NRG, erbB2 and erbB4 knock-outs, have defective cardiac development, although there are differences in the timing and character of these defects. Given the overall beneficial effects of active NRG-1β on myocyte survival, these results suggest the potential for detrimental effects of nonspecific strategies to inhibit MMPs in the injured or failing heart (32Creemers E.E.J.M. Cleutjens J.P.M. Smits J.F.M. Daemen M.J.A.P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Further investigation is required to fully elucidate the role of ADAMs or other MMPs in NRG processing in CMECs. The activation of erbB4 and erbB2/4-dependent phosphorylation of Akt induced by H2O2 in ARVMs in the absence of CMECs is equally interesting and warrants further investigation. We have shown previously that ARVMs do not express NRG (7Zhao Y.Y. Sawyer D.R. Baliga R.R. Opel D.J. Han X.Q. Marchionni M.A. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10261-10269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Moreover, conditioned medium from H2O2-treated ARVMs did not activate erbB4. Thus, activation of erbB4 by H2O2 in ARVM monoculture does not involve paracrine/autocrine signaling, and non-NRG erbB4 ligands that may be expressed in ARVMs are apparently not involved (33Fujino T. Hasebe N. Fujita M. Takeuchi K. Kawabe J. Tobise K. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Kikuchi K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 38: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although the EGFR is also expressed in myocytes and is known to respond to ROS in other cell systems (34Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 35Zhougang S.G. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F858-F865Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), our data indicate that it plays little role in H2O2 signaling in ARVMs. The inhibitory action of tyrphostin AG1478 on H2O2 signaling occurred at concentrations >5 μm and was specific for Akt phosphorylation. AG1478 inhibits both EGFR as well as erbB2/4 signaling. However lower (0.5 μm) concentrations of AG1478 are sufficient to inhibit EGFR signaling, and EGF had little effect on Akt activation in ARVMs. We demonstrate that AG1478 at 5 μm significantly inhibits NRG-1β-induced receptor activation and downstream signaling. Collectively, these results lead to the conclusion that H2O2-induced activation of Akt (but not Erk1/2, JNK, or p38) may occur via activation of erbB2/4. This NRG-independent pathway for erbB4/Akt activation may also be important for regulation of myocyte survival, because H2O2-induced apoptosis at [H2O2]100μM in ARVM monoculture is significantly increased by the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 3A) or Akt inhibitor (28Kwon S.H.

These results establish the neuregulin-1β/erbB4 signaling system as a paracrine mechanism by which CMECs modulate cardiomyocyte survival. These observations complement a growing literature showing that disruption of erbB expression or function accelerates the development of heart failure (11Crone S.A. Zhao Y.Y. Fan L. Gu Y.S.

https://openalex.org/W2013748560,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two forms of superoxide dismutase (SOD): MnSOD, encoded by SOD2, which is located within the mitochondrial matrix, and CuZnSOD, encoded by SOD1, which is located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Because two different SOD enzymes are located in the mitochondrion, we examined the relative roles of each in protecting mitochondria against oxidative stress. Using protein carbonylation as a measure of oxidative stress, we have found no correlation between overall levels of respiration and the level of oxidative mitochondrial protein damage in either wild type or sod mutant strains. Moreover, mitochondrial protein carbonylation levels in sod1, sod2, and sod1sod2 mutants are not elevated in cells harvested from mid-logarithmic and early stationary phases, suggesting that neither MnSOD nor CuZnSOD is required for protecting the majority of mitochondrial proteins from oxidative damage during these early phases of growth. During late stationary phase, mitochondrial protein carbonylation increases in all strains, particularly in sod1 and sod1sod2 mutants. By using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we have found that specific proteins become carbonylated in sod1 and sod2 mutants. We identified six mitochondrial protein spots representing five unique proteins that become carbonylated in a sod1 mutant and 19 mitochondrial protein spots representing 11 unique proteins that become carbonylated in a sod2 mutant. Although some of the same proteins are carbonylated in both mutants, other proteins are not. These findings indicate that MnSOD and CuZnSOD have both unique and overlapping functions in the mitochondrion.

These findings indicate that MnSOD and CuZnSOD have both unique and overlapping functions in the mitochondrion. Some of the oxygen that is consumed by the mitochondrial respiratory chain is not completely reduced to H2O (1Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem.

Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. In the presence of certain transition metals (e.g. iron or copper), hydrogen peroxide can be converted to the hydroxyl radical. These one-, two-, and three-electron-reduced forms of oxygen, respectively, are the reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; MnSOD, manganese-containing SOD; CuZn-SOD, copper- and zinc-containing SOD; SC, synthetic complete; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol; DNPH, 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine.1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; MnSOD, manganese-containing SOD; CuZn-SOD, copper- and zinc-containing SOD; SC, synthetic complete; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol; DNPH, 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine. that are primarily responsible for cellular oxidative stress (4Costa V. Moradas-Ferreira P. Mol. Aspects Med. 2001; 22: 217-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is thought to produce the majority of superoxide, particularly under conditions that increase the reduction state of the electron transport chain, electron leakage at NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) may also be responsible for some superoxide production (5Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). In addition, cytochrome c oxidase, which generates one-, two-, and three-electron-reduced forms of oxygen as part of its catalytic redox chemistry, may be responsible for the generation of ROS, under some conditions (6Poyton R.O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 316-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) constitutes a primary cellular defense against oxidative stress in most organisms. There are two forms of SOD in eukaryotic cells. A manganese-containing enzyme, MnSOD, is located in the mitochondrial matrix. A copper- and zinc-containing enzyme, CuZnSOD, is more widely distributed; it has been localized in different species to the cytosol, peroxisomes, lysosomes, the nucleus, and the mitochondrial intermembrane space (7Geller B.L.

Several diseases are associated with defects in CuZnSOD (14Macmillan-Crow L.A. Cruthirds D.L. Free Radical Res. 2001; 34: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 15Julien J.P. Cell. 2001; 104: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The best understood of these is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons and death as a result of respiratory failure. The damaging effects of CuZnSOD on motor neurons may be caused either by the production of peroxide by a toxic gain of function mutant enzyme (16Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B.

Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have abnormally shaped mitochondria and a reduced rate of respiration because of damage of electron transport chain proteins (19Menzies F.M. Cookson M.R. Taylor R.W. Turnbull D.M. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M.A. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. Shaw P.J. Brain. 2002; 125: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 20Jung C. Higgins C.M. Xu Z. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29626-29633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). To better understand the relationship(s) between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and superoxide dismutase, it would be helpful to know exactly which mitochondrial proteins are targets of oxidative damage in patients with defects in MnSOD or CuZnSOD. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CuZnSOD and MnSOD are encoded by the nuclear genes SOD1 and SOD2, respectively. As in other eukaryotes, yeast MnSOD is located in the mitochondrial matrix. Yeast CuZnSOD was initially thought to reside solely in the cytosol (10Gralla E.B. Scandauos J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 495-525Google Scholar) but more recently has also been found to reside in the mitochondrial intermembrane space as well (11Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CuZnSOD accounts for 90–95% of the total superoxide dismutase activity in S. cerevisiae. As a result, yeast strains carrying deletion mutations in SOD1 are more highly compromised than yeast strains carrying deletion mutations in SOD2. For example, sod1 mutants are more sensitive to redox-cycling drugs than sod2 mutants, have auxotrophies for lysine and methionine or cysteine, grow poorly in air and not at all under hyperoxic conditions, and have higher mutation rates compared with wild type cells (10Gralla E.B. Scandauos J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 495-525Google Scholar). The viability of a sod1 or sod2 mutant is enhanced by reducing oxygen tension or by abolishing respiration in these strains (22Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 23Guidot D.M. McCord J.M. Wright R.M. Repine J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26699-26703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CuZn-SOD and/or MnSOD function to protect yeast cells from ROS generated by mitochondrial respiration. This role for these enzymes is also suggested by the finding that superoxide dismutase activity is necessary for the survival of S. cerevisiae during the stationary phase, because cells switch from fermentation-based growth to growth fueled by respiration (22Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 24Longo V.D. Liou L.-L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have examined the role of yeast MnSOD or CuZnSOD in protecting stationary phase yeast cells from oxidative stress, little is known about the roles of these two enzymes in protecting cells from oxidative damage during earlier times in their growth cycle (e.g. mid-logarithmic and early stationary phase), and it is not known whether CuZnSOD and MnSOD have different or overlapping roles in protecting specific cellular components from oxidative stress. Also unclear are the relationships between the level of respiration and oxidative stress in cells in any phase of the growth cycle. In view of the importance of MnSOD and CuZnSOD in cellular defense against oxidative stress, their location within mitochondria, and the involvement of a CuZnSOD defect in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we sought to characterize the relative roles of both MnSOD and CuZnSOD in protecting mitochondria from protein oxidative damage. First, we assessed whether each superoxide dismutase is critical for protecting mitochondrial proteins from oxidative damage during mid-logarithmic, early, and late stationary growth and examined the relationship(s) between cellular respiration and oxidative stress during these phases of the growth cycle. Second, we identified specific mitochondrial proteins that are protected by each superoxide dismutase. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The yeast strains used were: EG103 (MATα, leu2–3, his3Δ1, trp1-289, ura3-52), EG110 (EG103 with sod2Δ::TRP1), EG118 (EG103 with sod1Δ::URA3), and EG133 (EG103 with sod1Δ::URA3, sod2Δ::TRP1) (22Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The cells were grown to the appropriate growth phase at 200 rpm and 28 °C in YPD media (1% bacto-yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, and 2% dextrose) or synthetic complete (SC) medium with 4-fold excess of Trp, Leu, Ura, and His and 2% dextrose, as described (22Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 25Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 62Google Scholar). The culture filled no more than 20% of the total flask volume to ensure adequate aeration. Paraquat Experiments—The cultures were grown to the early midlogarithmic phase. Paraquat was then added to a final concentration of 1mm, and the cultures were grown for an additional2hinthe presence of paraquat. Untreated cultures, which served as controls, were grown simultaneously. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation (4,000 × g), washed twice with ice-cold sterile, distilled water, and frozen at –20 °C. Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts—The cultures were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 × g) and washed twice with ice-cold sterile distilled water. The cell pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer (0.22 m NaCl, 12.5 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 1.25% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 0.125% SDS (w/v), 30 mm sodium deoxycholate) at a concentration of 1 ml/g cells. The cell suspension was then vortexed with1gof glass beads (0.25–0.5 mm) twice, for 1 min each time, with 1 min of cooling on ice in between each vortexing step. The supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and RIPA buffer (0.3 ml) was added to the glass beads and vortexed briefly. The resulting supernatant was added to the previous aliquot, and together they were centrifuged for 5 min at 1900 × g. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was frozen at –20 °C or used immediately. Isolation of Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Cell Fractions—All of the steps were performed on ice, unless otherwise noted. The cells were harvested at the appropriate growth phase, washed twice in ice-cold distilled water, and incubated in a shaking water bath at 28 °C, 100 rpm for 20 min in prespheroplast buffer (0.1 m Tris-SO4, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 9.3). The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold distilled water and resuspended in 0.5 g/ml spheroplast buffer (10 mm NaPO4, 1.35 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) with Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corp.) added to a final concentration of 3 mg/g cells. They were then incubated at 30 °C with gentle shaking (100 rpm). Spheroplasting was monitored by phase contrast microscopy and by determining the turbidity of an aliquot of cells after dilution 1:10 in 2% sodium sarcosyl. When 90% of the cells had formed spheroplasts, they were washed gently twice in post-spheroplast buffer (1.5 m sorbitol, 1mm EDTA, pH 7.0) with a homogenizing rod and then resuspended in lysis buffer (0.6 m mannitol, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0). Protease inhibitors (0.25 mm tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 0.25 mmNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the lysis buffer immediately prior to cell lysis. The spheroplasts were lysed for 3 s. on low speed followed by 25 s at maximum speed with a Sorvall Omnimixer (Newton, CT). This step was repeated for cells harvested in the late stationary phase. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (1,900 × g for 5 min). The supernatant containing both the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was then centrifuged (12,100 × g, 10 min.) to pellet the mitochondria. The resulting supernatant, designated as the cytosolic fraction, was frozen at –80 °C. The mitochondrial pellet was washed once in 0.6 m mannitol, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and centrifuged at 1,651 × g for 5 min to pellet any remaining debris. The supernatant containing the mitochondria was then pelleted by centrifugation (23,000 × g, for 10 min), resuspended in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of ∼5–10 μg/μl, and frozen at –80 °C. Measurements of Respiration Rates—Oxygen consumption rates in whole cells were measured using a Strathkelvin Oxygen Meter equipped with a Clark-type oxygen electrode fitted with a polypropylene membrane. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 × g), washed twice with ice-cold sterile, distilled water, and resuspended in 40 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, at a final concentration of 0.5 g/ml. The respiration rates were measured at 30 °C in a water-jacketed chamber in 40 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, with 1% dextrose added as a carbon source. Cyanide-insensitive respiration was measured after the addition of 1 mm KCN. The cyanide-sensitive respiration rate was calculated as μmol oxygen consumed per min in the absence of cyanide minus μmol oxygen consumed per min in the presence of cyanide, divided by the wet mass of cells. Oxygen saturation was calculated to be 200 μmol/liter in Boulder, CO (26Dirmeier R. O'Brien K. Engle M. Dodd A. Spears E. Poyton R.O. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 381: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Carbonyl Content in Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Fractions—The protein carbonyl content was measured as described (26Dirmeier R. O'Brien K. Engle M. Dodd A. Spears E. Poyton R.O. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 381: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 27Dirmeier R. O'Brien K.M. Engle M. Dodd A. Spears E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34773-34784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The nucleic acids were removed from the cytosolic fraction with streptomycin sulfate (28Levine R.L. Garland D. Oliver C.N. Amici A. Climent I. Lenz A.-G. Ahn B.-W. Shaltiel S. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (4844) Google Scholar), and the cytosolic proteins were precipitated with 80% acetone and then resuspended in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.5 m KPO4, pH 2.5. The cytosolic fractions from cells in late stationary phase were concentrated by dialysis in a bed of sucrose before removing nucleic acids and precipitating protein as described above. The mitochondrial fractions did not require treatment with streptomycin sulfate. SDS-PAGE of Mitochondrial Proteins—Mitochondrial proteins were diluted in an SDS loading buffer containing a final concentration of 10 mm NaPO4, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 4% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The proteins were separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel (10% (w/v) 32:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 0.1% SDS, 0.4 m Tris, pH 8.8) with a stacking gel composed of 3.5% (w/v) 32:1 acrylamide: bisacrylamide, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis of Carbonylated Proteins—The samples were prepared and separated by gel electrophoresis as described (27Dirmeier R. O'Brien K.M. Engle M. Dodd A. Spears E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34773-34784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), except that 100 μg of mitochondrial protein was loaded on each 13 cm Immobiline Drystrip (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, mitochondrial proteins were first separated using isoelectric focusing and then derivatized with DNP and separated in the second dimension on an 8–18% SDS-PAGE gradient gel. One set of gels was subjected to Western blotting with a primary anti-DNP antibody, as described below. A second set of replicate gels was silver-stained for protein quantitation and identification with MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Derivatization with DNP is done after isoelectric focusing because it prevents an alteration in spot migration that may result from changes in protein charge if derivatization were done prior to isoelectric focusing (29Reinheckel T. Korn S. Mohring S. Augustin W. Halangk W. Schild L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Western Immunoblotting—The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a Semi-Phor electroblotting apparatus (Hoefer). Protein carbonyl groups were derivatized with DNPH as described earlier (26Dirmeier R. O'Brien K. Engle M. Dodd A. Spears E. Poyton R.O. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 381: 589-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 27Dirmeier R. O'Brien K.M. Engle M. Dodd A. Spears E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34773-34784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The resulting hydrazone was then detected with anti-DNP antibodies (Dako) at a dilution of 1:4000 and a secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a dilution of 1:25,000. Antibody binding was visualized with a chemiluminescent detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The Western blots of gels from different strains were exposed to film for the exact same length of time. SOD proteins were detected with antibodies directed against Sod1p and Sod2p, which were kindly provided by Dr. Valeria Culotta. Protein Identification by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Protein spots from two-dimensional gels were prepared for MALDI-TOF as described (27Dirmeier R. O'Brien K.M. Engle M. Dodd A. Spears E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34773-34784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) with the following changes. For low abundance proteins, as many as 16 spots were pooled together from individual gels for analysis. In addition, the proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C with sequencing grade, modified porcine trypsin (Promega) diluted in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate to a final concentration of 0.015 μg/ml. Slices of gels from the background were excised and prepared for MALDI-TOF at the same time as protein spots. Any contaminating peaks detected in the background were deleted from the protein data base searches. Peptide Sequencing—Amino acid sequences were determined using an Applied Biosystems Pulsar MALDI-Q-TOF. The proteins were prepared as described above for MALDI-TOF, except that proteins were co-crystallized with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (Agilent Technologies) on a stainless steel sample plate. The mass spectrometer was first calibrated with a standard of Glu-fibrinogen peptide, and then a spectra of peptide fragments was obtained for each protein. Peptides were selected for fragmentation, and the resulting spectra was searched in the NCBI nonredundant data base using Mascot (Matrix Science). A protein was considered positively identified if it was identified from at least two separate protein preparations using MALDI-TOF or from at least one preparation with MALDI-TOF and sequencing of at least one peptide. Data Analysis and Quantification of Protein Carbonylation on Two-dimensional Gels—Two-dimensional gels and Western blots were scanned, and the resulting images were analyzed using the software Melanie 3.07 (Geneva Bioinformatics). A minimum of two replicate gels from three independent cultures (six total) were analyzed for each strain. Changes in protein level for each protein of interest were determined by quantitating spot intensity after silver staining, and changes in carbonylation level were quantitated after staining with anti-DNP antisera. Spot intensity was measured as the volume of the spot, which is a measurement of the pixel intensities integrated over the area of the spot. The percentage change in protein carbonylation was then determined in the mutant strains, relative to the wild type. The change in carbonylation of specific proteins in the mutant strains was normalized to the amount of that protein in that strain. An increase in carbonylation was considered significant if it showed a greater than 2-fold increase relative to the wild type, and this level of increase occurred in at least two of the replicate cultures (four gels total). Miscellaneous—Protein concentration was measured as described (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of Strains—Previous studies have shown that Sod1p is located in both the mitochondria and cytosol (11Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that this was also true of our strains by examining the levels of Sod1p and Sod2p in mitochondrial and cytosolic cell fractions (Fig. 1). As expected, Sod1p is not present in either the sod1 mutant (lanes 5 and 6) or in the sod1sod2 mutant (lanes 7 and 8), and Sod2p is absent from the sod2 mutant (lanes 3 and 4) and the sod1sod2 mutant (lanes 7 and 8). In wild type and sod1 mutant cells, Sod2p is found only in the mitochondrion (lanes 1 and 5), and in wild type and sod2 mutant cells, Sod1p is found in both mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions (lanes 1–4). Previous studies with sod mutants have used cells grown on either a defined SC growth medium (22Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 31Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or on the nutrientrich YPD medium (11Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

As the glucose is consumed it is converted to ethanol, which does not repress the expression of respiratory proteins and which, in turn, can be respired. So, early in the growth cycle of a yeast culture grown on glucose, cells obtain their energy primarily by fermenting glucose, whereas late in the growth cycle they obtain their metabolic energy by respiring ethanol. The growth of cells on two different carbon sources at different times in their growth cycle has been referred to as “diauxic growth.” As observed previously, sod1 and sod1sod2 mutants grow more slowly and reach a lower cell density on SC medium than sod2 or wild type cells (Fig. 2A). The difference in growth is accentuated after 10 h of growth when cells switch from using glucose to using ethanol carbon source as their main carbon source. Growth differences between strains are less obvious on YPD medium (Fig. 2B), although, as in SC medium, there is a slowing of growth rates for the sod1 and sod1sod2 mutants, compared with wild type and sod2 mutant cells, when cells switch from using glucose to using ethanol carbon source as their main carbon source after 8 h of growth. For the experiments presented here we have chosen to grow cells on YPD medium to compare our measurements of protein oxidation with the results of a recent study that examined the level of protein carbonylation in sod1 mutants that were also grown on YPD (11Sturtz L.A.

Role of MnSOD and CuZnSOD in Protecting Proteins from Oxidative Stress in Different Phases of the Growth Cycle of a Yeast Culture—Early studies with sod mutant cells grown on glucose-containing medium have provided evidence that superoxide dismutase activity is required to protect yeast cells from ROS produced by mitochondrial respiration (22Longo V.D.

Because the level of mitochondrial respiration varies during the diauxic growth cycle of yeast culture grown on glucose-containing medium (see below), it was of interest to ask about the relative contributions of MnSOD and CuZnSOD to protecting cells from oxidative stress at different times during the growth cycle. For this study sod1, sod2, and sod1sod2 mutant cells were grown on YPD and harvested in the mid-logarithmic phase after5hof growth and prior to the diauxic transition, in the early stationary phase after 24 h of growth, and in the late stationary phase after 5 days of growth.

We showed previously that S. aureus adheres to desquamated epithelial cells and that clumping factor B (ClfB), a surface-located MSCRAMM (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) known for its ability to bind to the α-chain of fibrinogen, is partly responsible (O'Brien, L. M., Walsh, E. J., Massey, R. C., Peacock, S. J., and Foster, T. J. (2002) Cell. Microbiol. 4, 759–770). We identified cytokeratin 10 (K10) as the ligand recognized by ClfB. Here we have shown that purified recombinant human and murine K10 immobilized on a plastic surface supports adherence of S. aureus in a ClfB-dependent manner. Furthermore, the recombinant A domain of ClfB (rClfB 45–542) bound to immobilized K10 dose-dependently and saturably. Subdomains of human and murine K10 were expressed and purified. The N-terminal head domain (residues 1–145) did not support the binding of rClfB or adherence of S. aureus ClfB+. In contrast, the C-terminal tail domains (human rHK10 452–593, mouse rMK10 454–570) promoted avid binding and adherence. Isothermal titration microcalorimetry and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence experiments gave dissociation constants for rClfB 45–542 binding to rMK10 454–570 of 1.4 and 1.7 μm, respectively. The tail region of K10 is composed largely of quasi-repeats of Tyr-(Gly/Ser)n. A synthetic peptide corresponding to a typical glycine loop (YGGGSSGGGSSGGY; Y-Y loop peptide) inhibited the adherence of S. aureus ClfB+ to immobilized MK10 to a level of 80%, whereas control peptides had no effect. The KD of rClfB 45–542 for the Y-Y loop peptide was 5.3 μm by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Thus ClfB binds to the glycine loop region of the tail domain of keratin 10 where there are probably multiple binding sites. Binding is discussed in the context of the dock-lock-latch model for MSCRAMM-ligand interactions. We provide an explanation for the molecular basis for S. aureus adherence to the squamous epithelium and suggest that nasal colonization might be prevented by reagents that inhibit this interaction.

We provide an explanation for the molecular basis for S. aureus adherence to the squamous epithelium and suggest that nasal colonization might be prevented by reagents that inhibit this interaction. Staphylococcus aureus often colonizes the dermis of apparently healthy individuals and is an important opportunistic human pathogen, causing both community-acquired and nosocomial infections associated with indwelling medical devices or surgical wounds. It can cause superficial infections or more serious invasive diseases such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and septicaemia. The success of S. aureus as a pathogen is due in part to its ability to adhere to a wide range of host tissues. An important risk factor for disease is carriage of the bacterium (1von Eiff C. Becker K. Machka K. Stammer H. Peters G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar) in the moist squamous epithelium adjacent to the nasal ostium in the anterior nares (2Peacock S.J. DeSilva I Lowy F.D.

Immunol. 2001; 8: 1064-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). S. aureus also colonizes the axillae and the perineum (4Williams R.E.O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1963; 27: 56-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but nasal carriage appears to be a prerequisite for colonization of these sites (1von Eiff C. Becker K. Machka K. Stammer H. Peters G. N. Engl. J.

Adherence of S. aureus to host extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and collagen is important for initiating infection. Adhesion is mediated by bacterial cell wall-associated proteins called MSCRAMMs 1The abbreviations used are: MSCRAMM, microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules; ClfB, clumping factor B; IF, intermediate filaments; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.1The abbreviations used are: MSCRAMM, microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules; ClfB, clumping factor B; IF, intermediate filaments; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules). S. aureus can express up to 20 different potential MSCRAMMs that are covalently anchored to peptidoglycan through the action of a transpeptidase called sortase (6Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 7Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Science. 1999; 285: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Clumping factor B (ClfB) is an MSCRAMM that is expressed in vitro only during the exponential phase of bacterial growth. It mediates adherence of S. aureus to immobilized fibrinogen and promotes bacterial clumping in soluble fibrinogen (8Ní Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol.

Ligand binding is specified by the A region, which is divided into three independently folded subdomains N1, N2, and N3 (see Fig. 1A) (10Perkins S. Walsh E.J. Deivanayagam C.C. Narayana S.V.

The S. aureus metalloprotease aureolysin cleaves ClfB at the SLAVA motif, which separates domain N1 from N2, resulting in the loss of fibrinogen binding activity (9McAleese F.M. Walsh E.J.

Recently, we reported on the molecular basis for the adhesion of S. aureus to desquamated nasal epithelial cells, a phenomenon that is likely to be crucial in successful nasal colonization. We demonstrated that adhesion to squamous cells was in part mediated by ClfB and that the ligand on squamous cells was most likely cytokeratin 10, elements of which are exposed on the cell surface (12O'Brien L.M. Walsh E.J. Massey R.C. Peacock S.J. Foster T.J. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 759-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The cytokeratins represent a multigene family of polypeptides that form intermediate filaments (IF). Along with actin microfilaments and microtubules, the IF constitute the cytoskeleton of vertebrate epithelial cells (13Kirfel J. Magin T.M. Reichelt J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Their primary function is to provide mechanical strength to cells (13Kirfel J. Magin T.M. Reichelt J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Zhou X.M. Idler W.W. Steven A.C. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15584-15589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of differences in molecular weight and pI, cytokeratins can be divided into two types: type II keratins that include K1, K5, and K6 and are generally more basic and larger (53–67 kDa) than the type I molecules, and K10 and K14–K17 (40–63 kDa). Keratin filaments are composed of multimers of obligate heterodimers of a type I and a type II keratin. In the human epidermis, three different pairs of keratins are expressed; K5 and K14 are characteristic of basal or proliferating cells, K1 and K10 are present in the more differentiated suprabasal layer, whereas K6 and K16 or K17 are found in cells induced to hyperproliferate by disease or injury and in epithelial cells grown in cell culture (14Zhou X.M. Idler W.W. Steven A.C. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15584-15589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokeratin 10 has a basic molecular structure (Fig. 1B) similar to all cytoplasmic IF proteins consisting of a central rod with a highly conserved secondary structure. The rod domain can be further divided into four α-helical subdomains called 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B that form coiled-coils with a neighboring subunit and that are separated by short non-α-helical linkers (L1, L12, and L2). The central rod is flanked by non-α-helical end domains, called the head and tail regions, which vary in size and amino acid sequence (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal head region of K10 contains three subdomains, E1, V1, and H1. The very basic E1 domain is rich in serine and glycine residues. The V1 domain contains quasi-repeats of the form phenylanine, tyrosine, or leucine–(glycine/serine)n (where n = 2–6). The short H1 domain is conserved in other type I keratins (Fig. 1B). The carboxyl tail region consists of a V2 domain of quasi-repeats of tyrosine-(glycine/serine)n and a conserved E2 domain (14Zhou X.M. Idler W.W. Steven A.C. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15584-15589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive size polymorphisms of the K10 chain occur in the V2 domain of the tail region (14Zhou X.M. Idler W.W. Steven A.C.

In this study, we examined the binding of ClfB to recombinant human and mouse K10 at the molecular level. Recombinant proteins corresponding to the full-length K10 proteins and the head and tail regions of K10 were tested for their ability to support adherence of S. aureus cells and binding to recombinant ClfB protein. The ClfB-binding site in K10 was localized to a peptide loop in the tail region by measuring binding to recombinant K10 truncates and synthetic peptides. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli was routinely grown on L-broth or agar, and S. aureus was grown on trypticase soy broth (Oxoid) or agar. S. aureus was grown to an A600 of 0.6 (exponential phase, for optimum expression of ClfB) or 8–12 (stationary phase) in brain-heart infusion broth, 50 ml in a 250-ml conical flask shaken at 200 rpm at 37 °C (8Ní Eidhin D.

Reactions were carried out with a 1-min denaturation step at 94 °C, a 1-min annealing step (the temperature of which depended on the individual primers), and elongation at 72 °C for 2–4 min depending on the length of the PCR product. This standard cycle was repeated 30 times followed by incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were purified using the High Pure™ PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science), cleaved with the appropriate restriction enzyme, and cloned into plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen).

Synthetic Peptides—K10 peptides (15-mer peptides) were synthesized at the Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin. K10 peptide 1, termed the Y-Y loop peptide, had the sequence YGGGSSGGGSSGGGY. Peptide 2 had the sequence GGGSSGGGYGGGSSS and was called the GS-peptide. Peptide 3 had the sequence GGSGSGSGSGYGSGG and was a scrambled version of peptide 2. SDS-PAGE and Western Immunoblotting—Recombinant K10 proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE by standard procedures (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) on gels containing 10–15% acrylamide. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride Western blotting membranes (Roche Applied Science) by the wet system (Bio-Rad) in Tris-HCl (0.02 m), glycine (0.15 m), and methanol (20%). Membranes were incubated for 15 h at 4 °C in 10% blocking reagent (Marvel milk powder). Monoclonal antibodies to K10 and to the His tag at 1:2,000 were incubated with the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (DakoCytomation, 1:2,000) was used to detect bound antibody in a 1-h incubation at room temperature. Membranes were developed using LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to x-ray film. Adherence of Bacterial Cells to Immobilized rK10 —Adherence of S. aureus to immobilized rK10 was performed as follows. Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorb microtiter plates were coated with rK10 in carbonate buffer (15 mm Na2HCO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) was added, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed three times with PBS. A bacterial cell suspension (A600 = 1.0 in PBS) was added (100 μl/well), and the plates were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS, and bound cells were fixed with formaldehyde (25% v/v) for 30 min and stained with crystal violet (0.5% v/v, 100 μl/well) for 1min. Following three washes with PBS, acetic acid (5% v/v) was added (100 μl/well) for 10 min at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Labsystems Multiskan Plus). Binding of Recombinant ClfB to Immobilized K10 —ELISA plates were coated with rK10 in carbonate buffer overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed twice with PBS and incubated at 37 °C with bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed with PBS, and varying concentrations of rClfB 45–542 in PBS with Tween 20 (0.01% v/v) were added. The plates were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Any unbound protein was removed by washing with PBS, and plates were incubated with rabbit anti-ClfB 45–452 antibodies (9McAleese F.M. Walsh E.J. Sieprawska M. Potempa J. Foster T.J. J. Biol.

Wells were washed, and HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (DakoCytomation; 1:2,000) was added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, 100 μl of a chromogenic substrate solution (1 mg/ml tetramethylbenzidine and 0.006% H202 in 0.05 m phosphate citrate buffer pH 5.0) was added, and plates were developed for 10 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 m H2S04 (50 μl/well), and plates were read at 450 nm. Inhibition of S. aureus and rClfB Binding to Immobilized rK10 by Synthetic Peptides—S. aureus cells (1 × 108 colony-forming units) were preincubated with increasing concentrations of each peptide in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. The cell-peptide mixture was added to rK10-coated microtiter wells for 90 min at room temperature. Wells were washed with PBS, and cells were fixed with formaldehyde. Adherent cells were stained with crystal violet, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm as described above. Recombinant ClfB in PBS-Tween was preincubated with varying amounts of selected peptides for 1 h at room temperature. The protein-peptide mixture was added to microtiter wells coated with 0.2 μm rHK10 or rMK10 for 1 h at room temperature. Bound rClfB was detected as described above. Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry—Experiments to measure the binding of rClfB 45–542 to rMK10 454–570 or the Y-Y loop peptide were performed with a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) using a 250-μl syringe and stirring at 300 rpm 15 °C. In a typical experiment, the cell contained 17 μm rClfB 45–542, and the syringe contained 117 μm rMK10 454–570. Both solutions were dialyzed into PBS from the same batch to minimize artifacts due to any differences in buffer composition and were degassed at 4 °C for 30 min immediately before use. The titration was performed with one preliminary injection of 5 μl and 29 injections of 10 μl with an injection speed of 0.5 μl/s. The stirring speed was 300 rpm, and the time between the injections was 260 s. To take into account the heat of dilution, two blank titrations were performed, one by injecting rMK10 into buffer and the other by injecting buffer into the rClfB solution. The averaged heats of dilution were subtracted. Data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin software (version 5.0), fitting them to a single site model. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence—The amino acid sequence of ClfB 45–542 contains 2 Trp residues at positions 405 and 522, respectively. Initial experiments suggested that the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of rClfB 45–542 was quenched by the presence of saturating concentrations of rMK10 454–570 or the Y-Y loop peptide. Neither of the ligand peptides contained a Trp residue, and we could therefore use intrinsic fluorescence to quantitate the formation of MSCRAMM-ligand complexes and calculate a KD for the interaction. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of 2 μm rClfB 45–542 in PBS was examined with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrofluorimeter LS 50B at room temperature. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm (5-nm slit width) while monitoring emission from 310 to 390 nm (5-nm slit width). Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence after the addition of rMK10 (from 1 to 15 μm) or peptides (from 1 to 40 μm) was analyzed according to the modified plot of Stern-Volmer (22Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar) as follows. The F0/(F0 – F) ratio (where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities at 345 nm in the absence and presence of ligand, respectively) plotted against the reciprocal of ligand concentration yields a straight line, the intercept of which on the x axis equals the value of the association constant for the ligand. Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Human Keratin 10 —To generate recombinant keratin 10 proteins, the full-length human krt10 gene was amplified by PCR from a commercially available cDNA prepared from mRNA extracted from human skin. We reasoned that mRNA coding for K10 would be present in this tissue. K10 DNA was amplified by PCR using primers designed to recognize the extreme 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding sequence. The primers had 5′ extensions to facilitate directional cloning into the E. coli expression vector pQE30. A PCR product of ∼1,500 bp was obtained that was about 180 bp smaller than the smallest of the K10 gene sequences lodged in the NCBI data base (data not shown). Extensive allelic variation occurs in K10 DNA due to polymorphisms in DNA encoding the V2 domain of the tail region. Additional PCR reactions were performed to generate K10 truncates corresponding to the N-terminal head and C-terminal tail regions of the human protein (Fig. 1B). PCR amplification of the head region of human K10 DNA generated a product of 435 bp, which corresponded to that predicted for the known K10 DNA sequences. In contrast, PCR amplification of the tail region of the K10 gene generated a PCR product of ∼240 bp, 100 bp smaller than that which would correspond to the smallest known variant (data not shown). DNA sequencing revealed an extensive deletion of the distal part of the V2 domain leaving only one Y-(G/S) unit as compared with six units in the NCBI sequence KRHUO (Fig. 2A). We named this variant K10-Invitrogen. The deletion most likely occurred during amplification and probably does not represent a novel human krt10 allele. An amino acid alignment of the tail regions of human K10 sequences from the NCBI data base with the sequence of Invitrogen-K10 from this study is shown in Fig. 2A. Plasmid pMK10 containing the mouse K10 gene was used as a template to PCR-amplify K10 DNA corresponding to full-length K10 and to the tail region. Both PCR products obtained were the expected size. After cloning into pQE30, DNA sequencing showed that no deletions had occurred. Fig. 2B shows the amino acid sequence comparison of the tail regions of human K10-Invitrogen with mouse K10. The extreme C-terminal 7 residues of both human and murine K10 are identical. The N-terminal part of the tail is also highly conserved, whereas the central region of the tail is variable. GS-rich quasi-repeat sequences are present in both human and mouse rK10. Clumping Factor B Promotes S. aureus and L. lactis Adherence to Immobilized Recombinant Human and Mouse K10 — Previously, we showed that ClfB-promoted adherence of S. aureus to immobilized mixed epidermal keratins occurred most likely through a specific interaction with K10. To demonstrate this unambiguously, recombinant human and mouse K10 were purified and coated onto microtiter wells. ClfB is only expressed on the surface of S. aureus cells from the exponential phase of growth, whereas cells from the stationary phase are devoid of functional ClfB (9McAleese F.M. Walsh E.J. Sieprawska M. Potempa J. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29969-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Accordingly, strains 8325-4 and Newman as well as their isogenic clfB mutants were grown to exponential phase and stationary phase and tested for their ability to adhere to immobilized recombinant human K10. The wild type strains grown to exponential phase adhered avidly to human K10, whereas the clfB mutants of 8325-4 and Newman attached weakly (Fig. 3A). Experiments performed with mouse K10 gave very similar results (data not shown). In addition, wild type cells from stationary phase cultures bound less strongly than the same strain grown to exponential phase (Fig. 3A). This showed that S. aureus strains adhere to rK10 and that adherence is predominately mediated by ClfB. The data also suggest that a second keratin adhesin is expressed by strain Newman in the stationary phase but not by 8325-4. Further evidence for ClfB as a keratin 10 adhesin was generated by exploring the adherence properties of L. lactis transformed with a plasmid expressing the ClfB protein. L. lactis expressing ClfB on its surface adhered strongly, in a dose-dependent and saturable manner, to immobilized rMK10 and rHK10 (Fig. 3B), whereas the wild type strain carrying the empty expression plasmid pKS80 did not adhere to the recombinant keratins. Recombinant ClfB Binds to Immobilized rHK10 and rMK10 —The ability of ClfB to bind to human and mouse rK10 was further investigated by performing ELISA-type binding assays with recombinant ClfB A domain (rClfB 45–542). Wells of microtiter plates were coated with rK10, and increasing concentrations of rClfB 45–542 were added. Bound ClfB was detected with anti-ClfB polyclonal antibodies followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies. ClfB bound to both human and mouse rK10 in a concentration-dependent and saturable fashion (Fig. 4). The concentrat"

Caspase-11 plays a crucial role in LPS-induced septic shock in mice. We examined the mechanism of LPS neurotoxicity on SN dopaminergic neurons in C57BL/6 mice and caspase-11 knockout mice. Mice were stereotaxically injected with LPS into the SN on one side and vehicle into the SN of the other side. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse transcriptase-PCR were performed to evaluate damage of SN dopaminergic neurons and activation of microglial cells. Intranigral injection of LPS at 1 or 3 microg/microl/site decreased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and increased microglial cells in the SN compared with the contralateral side injected with vehicle at days 7 and 14 post-injection in C57BL/6 mice. Intranigral injection of LPS at 3 microg/microl/site induced the expression of caspase-11 mRNA in the ventral midbrain at 6, 8, and 12 h post-injection, and the expression of caspase-11-positive cells in the SN at 8 and 12 h post-injection. Moreover, LPS at 3 microg/microl/site increased interleukin-1beta content in the ventral midbrain at 12 and 24 h post-injection. LPS failed to elicit these responses in caspase-11 knockout mice. Our results indicate that the neurotoxic effects of LPS on nigral dopaminergic neurons are mediated by microglial activation, interleukin-1beta, and caspase-11 expression in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1964862882,"Members of the copper uptake transporter (CTR) family from yeast, plants, and mammals including human are required for cellular uptake of the essential metal copper. Based on biochemical data, CTRs have three transmembrane domains and have been shown to oligomerize in the membrane. Among individual members of the family, there is little amino acid sequence identity, raising questions as to how these proteins adopt a common fold, oligomerize, and participate in copper transport. Using site-directed mutagenesis, tryptophan scanning, genetic complementation, subcellular localization, chemical cross-linking, and the yeast unfolded protein response, we demonstrated that at least half of the third transmembrane domain (TM3) plays a vital role in CTR structure and function. The results of our analysis showed that TM3 contains two functionally distinct faces. One face bears a highly conserved Gly-X-X-X-Gly (GG4) motif, which we showed to be essential for CTR oligomerization. Moreover, we showed that steric constraints reach past the GG4-motif itself including amino acid residues that are not conserved throughout the CTR family. A second face of TM3 contains three amino acid positions that, when mutated to tryptophan, cause predominantly abnormal localization but are still partially functional in growth complementation experiments. These mutations cluster on the face opposite to the GG4-bearing face of TM3 where they may mediate interactions with the remaining two transmembrane domains. Taken together, our data support TM3 as being buried within trimeric CTR where it plays an essential role in CTR assembly.

This ability of numerous CTR proteins to functionally replace endogenous S. cerevisiae Ctr1p and Ctr3p has led to a model in which CTRs themselves act as transporters for copper ions across the plasma membrane.Recent work (18Ishida S.

This finding creates a puzzle, because the cisplatin molecule and copper ions are structurally unrelated and, hence, the mechanism of transport is probably different for the two substrates. Unfortunately, the structure-function relationships remain poorly understood within the CTR family of membrane proteins. However, based on their amino acid sequences, CTR proteins lack nucleotidebinding domains and are predicted to have three transmembrane α-helices. Initial biochemical characterization of CTR proteins showed that they form oligomers in the membrane (10Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Yet, the role of the membrane-spanning domains in copper transport is largely unknown and their study is hampered by the fact that sequence identities between CTR proteins from different evolutionary branches are low. In fact, only two sequence motifs, Met-X-X-X-Met and Gly-X-X-X-Gly (GG4) in the second and third transmembrane domains (TM2 and TM3), respectively, are invariantly conserved within the membrane embedded domain of all of the CTRs. Recent studies revealed that the Met-X-X-X-Met in TM2 plays a vital role in the chemistry of copper sensing and uptake (22Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Russ and Engelman (34Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) have shown that the GG4 motif plays a vital role in stabilizing transmembrane helix-helix interactions and the resulting dimerization of the single transmembrane protein glycophorin A. Similarly, a GG4 motif is involved in helix packing at the interface between subunits in the mechanosensitive channels MscS from Escherichia coli and MscL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (26Bass R.B.

Yet, GG4 motifs do not exclusively mediate membrane protein oligomerization as shown by the crystal structure of the tetrameric E. coli GlpF, a member of the multi-membranespanning glycero-aquaporin family where GG4-mediated helix-helix interactions stabilize the fold of a monomer (28Fu D.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5990-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The presence of an invariantly conserved GG4 motif in TM3 of all of the known members of the CTR family suggests an important role of TM3 in the structure-function of CTR transporters. In this work, we demonstrated that the GG4 motif is essential for the formation of fully functional copper uptake proteins in the case of two distantly related members of the CTR family, human CTR1 and yeast CTR3. Our results identified two faces of TM3 that point to a central role of this transmembrane helix for the structural organization of CTR proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Constructs and Yeast Transformation—The Δctr1,3 yeast strain (MATa ura3 lys2 ade2 trp1 his3 leu2 Δctr1::LEU2), also containing a transposon interfering with Ctr3p expression, and the yeast expression plasmid, pDB20-hCTR1-URA3, were obtained from Dr. Jane Gitschier. The pDB20 multiple cloning site was modified by excision of the insert with HindIII and ligation of two overlapping oligonucleotides containing NheI and MluI restriction sites into the HindIII-linearized vector. To allow immunodetection of human CTR1 (hCTR1), the hemagglutinin (HA) tag (MEYPYDVPDYA) was inserted at the N terminus using an oligonucleotide that encodes the HA epitope and anneals to 18 nucleotides of the hCTR1 open reading frame after the first methionine. A reverse oligonucleotide was synthesized that anneals to 21 nucleotides up to and including the stop codon of hCTR1. The forward and reverse oligonucleotides contained NheI and MluI sites, respectively, and were used to perform high fidelity PCR on the original pDB20-hCTR1 plasmid. PCR products were gel-purified, digested with NheI and MluI, and ligated into the modified pDB20 vector. All of the experiments of human CTR1 and mutants in this investigation were performed using the N-terminally tagged HA-hCTR1 construct. The pRS316-yCTR3-GFP-URA3 plasmid, obtained from Dr. Dennis Thiele, was used as a template to produce mutants for complementation and fluorescence localization. This plasmid was also used for subcloning the insert into the p423GPD vector to produce mutants for tryptophanscanning experiments. The position of the third transmembrane domain was identified using standard hydropathy analysis to generate mutants for tryptophan-scanning experiments. Plasmid mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and all of the constructs used in this study were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Yeast were transformed using lithium acetate, and plasmids were selected for uracil complementation by plating on minimal dextrose (MD) plates containing dextrose (2%), adenine, histidine, lysine, and tryptophan (all 20 mg/liter) but lacking uracil.Functional Complementation—The Δctr1,3 yeast strain transformed with plasmids expressing HA-hCTR1, HA-hCTR1G167L, HA-hCTR1G171L, yCTR3-GFP, yCTR3G202L-GFP, or yCTR3G206L-GFP were grown in MD medium lacking uracil to an A600 = 1.2-1.5. Assays were set up essentially as described (11Kampfenkel K. Kushnir S. Babiychuk E. Inze D. Van Montagu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28479-28486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 12Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Yeast were washed once with sterile distilled water and adjusted to an A600 of 1.0 in water. Five serial dilutions (1:10 in succession) were spotted onto YPG (yeast peptone glycerol) plates containing glycerol as the only carbon source (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 3% (v/v) glycerol) supplemented with 80 μm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS; Sigma) for copper depletion, 50 μm copper sulfate for copper excess, or a third condition having no chelator or additional metal to achieve trace copper levels. Plates containing excess copper (50 μm) were incubated at 30 °C for 3-5 days. Copper-depleted plates were incubated at 30 °C for at least 10 days. Plates were illuminated on a fluorescent light box, and images were taken using digital photography. Human CTR1 and GG4 mutants expressed from both pDB20 and p423GPD (for the unfolded protein response) plasmids were verified by functional complementation and yielded identical results (data not shown).Fluorescence Microscopy—Wild type yCTR3-GFP fusion protein, yCTR3G202L-GFP, yCTR3G206L-GFP, or TM3 tryptophan-scanning mutants expressed from either pRS316 or p423GPD vectors were grown in minimal dextrose medium. Wild type yCTR3-GFP, yCTR3G202L-GFP, and yCTR3G206L-GFP cultures were incubated in 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Sigma) for 5 min before visualization on a Nikon TE2000 fluorescence microscope using epi-illumination. GFP and DAPI images were captured with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera and then colorized and merged with Adobe Photoshop. Tryptophan scanning was performed with wild type yCTR3-GFP fusion and mutants all expressed from the p423GPD vector.Cross-linking Analysis—Yeast expressing HA-tagged wild type hCTR1 and HA-hCTR1G167L mutants from Δctr1,3 yeast strain were grown in MD medium to an A600 of 1.0-1.2. Crude membranes were prepared from yeast using glass bead lysis or a Z Plus Series cell disrupter (Constant Systems, Ltd). Membranes were first deglycosylated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs) for HA-hCTR1 for 1 h at 37 °C before solubilization with either 1% Triton X-100 or 1 mm dodecyl-β-d-maltoside in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 15 min using a TLA-120 rotor and a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge. To partially purify the HA-hCTR1G167L mutant, dodecyl-β-d-maltoside-solubilized material was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, eluted with 60 mm imidazole, and concentrated using Centricon® YM-100 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). The homobifunctional cross-linkers, ethylene glycol succinimidylsuccinimate and dithiobis succinimidylpropionate (both from Sigma), were added to detergent-solubilized protein at a final concentration of 0.25-3 mm and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were halted by the addition of a primary amine (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and incubated for an additional 15 min. Western blotting was performed using mouse monoclonal antiserum anti-HA antibody (Covance Research Products, Inc.), which recognizes the HA tag inserted at the N terminus of human CTR1.Degradation Assay—Δctr1,3 yeast strain transformed with pDB20 HA-tagged hCTR1 wild type, HA-hCTR1G167L, and HA-hCTR1G171L mutants were grown to A600 = 1.0. Cycloheximide (100 μg/ml final) dissolved in Me2SO was added to halt protein synthesis, and 1-ml samples were removed from the culture at 0, 1, and 3 h. Total protein was extracted essentially as described (30Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L. McCracken A.A. Watkins S.C. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Samples were spun in a tabletop centrifuge, and the resulting cell pellet was washed once with distilled water. To disrupt the membranes, cells were resuspended in 2 m NaOH, 1.12 m β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 15 min on ice with occasional vortexing. To precipitate protein, 75 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid was added and incubated for an additional 20 min on ice. Samples were spun at 16,000 × g in a tabletop centrifuge for 5 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample-loading buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol for Western blotting.Yeast-unfolded Protein Response Assay—The pSZ1 plasmid containing the 22-base pair unfolded protein response element (UPRE) upstream of the coding segment for β-galactosidase was provided by Dr. Mark Hochstrasser. pSZ1 was transformed into S. cerevisiae Δctr1,3 yeast strain using selection on minimal dextrose plates lacking uracil. A single clone was used for all of the subsequent transformations of the p423GPD expression vector containing HA-tagged wild type and mutant human CTR1 on MD plates lacking histidine and uracil. Random clones (n = 3) of each construct were selected and grown in minimal dextrose to a mid-log growth phase. Secondary cultures for each mutant were grown from equivalent amounts of cells inoculated from the primary culture and subjected to the UPR assay when A600 ≤ 0.6. The UPR assay was performed as previously described for bacteria (31Schneider D. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3105-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics.

Within TM3, all of the members of the family have a conserved GG4 motif (Fig. 1B). Because this sequence motif is intimately involved in stabilizing helix-helix interactions in other membrane proteins (33MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 34Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 35Senes A. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9056-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the GG4 motif plays a crucial role in the structure and, consequently, the function of the CTR copper uptake transporters. To test this hypothesis, we first disrupted the GG4 motif of tagged hCTR1 and yCTR3 by individually replacing each glycine (hCTR1, Gly167 and Gly171; yCTR3, Gly202 and Gly206) with leucine and then determined whether the mutant proteins were still able to rescue a growth defect of a yeast strain incapable of high affinity copper uptake (Δctr1,3). Fig. 2 demonstrates that the tagged wild type proteins HA-hCTR1 and yCTR3-GFP were able to support the growth of the Δctr1,3 strain, even under copper-depleted conditions using the copper chelator BCS. In contrast, the HA-hCTR1G167L and yCTR3G202L-GFP mutants in which the first glycine in the GG4 motif had been replaced by leucine were not able to complement the growth defect (Fig. 2, panels A and D, respectively). Interestingly, the replacement of the second glycine residue affected the function of the human and yeast proteins in different ways. The yCTR3G206L-GFP mutant was completely non-functional by complementation, whereas a partially functional phenotype was observed in the case for the corresponding HA-hCTR1G171L mutant. The latter mutant grew on trace amounts of copper (neither excess copper nor chelator added, Fig. 2, panel B) but exhibited very poor growth in the presence of BCS. The apparent differences in growth were not attributed to a lack of protein expression, because Western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy confirmed that each clone expressed its respective CTR mutant (Figs. 3 and 5A). Moreover, the fact that all of the yeast clones grew well in the presence of excessive copper indicated that none of the CTR constructs tested was toxic to the cell (Fig. 2, panels C and F) and that growth of the Δctr1,3 strain on trace amounts of copper or in the presence of BCS was solely dependent on the expression of functional copper transporter at the plasma membrane.Fig. 2Effect of GG4 mutations on human CTR1 and yeast CTR3 function. Yeast deficient in high affinity copper uptake (Δctr1,3) were transformed with vector only, HA-tagged wild type human CTR1 (wt), and GG4 mutants HA-hCTR1G167L (G167L) and HA-hCTR1G171L (G171L), wild type yeast CTR3-GFP fusion wt, and the corresponding yeast CTR3 GG4 mutants G202L and G206L. Yeast transformants were grown in minimal dextrose medium before two washes with double distilled water. All of the cultures were then adjusted to A600 = 1.0 and plated in serial 1:10 dilutions on plates containing glycerol as the sole non-fermentable carbon source. A, copper depletion for HA-hCTR1 was acheived with 80 μm copper chelator BCS. B, neither copper nor BCS was added to the plates. C, excess copper (50 μm).

GG4 mutants G202L (panel B) and G206L (panel C) are trapped in a perinuclear intracellular compartment as revealed by DAPI staining of nuclear DNA and a ring at the periphery of the cell. Accumulation of GFP-tagged mutant proteins in both regions is indicative of ER localization in yeast. Smaller DAPI-stained points represent mitochondrial DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Processing of GG4 mutants and induction of the unfolded protein response. A, yeast cultures expressing the indicated constructs were grown to mid-log phase before protein synthesis was halted with cycloheximide. Samples were removed from the culture at the indicated time points, and total protein extracts were subjected to Western blot using an anti-HA primary antibody. Note that a nearly overexposed blot demonstrates the lack of any higher order glycosylation for the G167L mutant compared with wild type and G171L. The doublet of bands observed for the G167L mutant corresponds to unglycosylated and core-glycosylated species, respectively. Recall in Fig. 4 that complex glycosylation (seen as high molecular mass smearing) as well as core glycosylation (as a distinct band that migrated at ∼28 kDa), could be reduced to a single band (∼23 kDa) upon exposure to PNGase F. B, yeast transformed with both pSZ1-UPRE-LacZ and an expression plasmid carrying either wild type G167L or G171L were subjected to β-galactosidase assay to determine the extent of induction of the unfolded protein response (n = 3-4 randomly selected colonies/condition).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The GG4 Motif Is Required for CTR Processing and Oligomerization—Because mutation of the first position of the GG4 motif completely blocked growth complementation for both hCTR1 and yCTR3 but did not interfere with their expression, we reasoned that these mutations result in a bona fide structural defect that prevents the proteins from functioning in copper uptake. To test this hypothesis, we exploited that yCTR3-GFP is functional in high affinity copper uptake in yeast (20Pena M.M. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This fusion protein was used to determine the localization of both the unmutated copper transporter and G202L and G206L mutants in living yeast cells. Fig. 3 demonstrates that yCTR3-GFP (panel A) but not yCTR3G202L-GFP or yCTR3G206L-GFP (panels B and C, respectively) was localized to the plasma membrane in the Δctr1,3 yeast strain. The yCTR3G202L-GFP and yCTR3G206L-GFP exhibited mislocalization to an intracellular compartment likely to be the endoplasmic reticulum based on the characteristic staining of both a perinuclear ring, revealed by DNA staining with DAPI, as well as a ring at the periphery of the cell. Thus, the failure of yCTR3G202L and yCTR3G206L-GFP to complement growth of a yeast strain deficient in high affinity copper uptake was attribut"

These are the two presenilins that activate signaling molecules and are implicated in Alzheimer's disease, signal peptide peptidase (SPP), required for immune surveillance, and four SPP-like candidate proteases (SPPLs), of unknown function. Here we describe a comparative analysis of the topologies of SPP and its human homologues, SPPL2a, -2b, -2c, and -3. We demonstrate that their N-terminal extensions are located in the extracellular space and, except for SPPL3, are modified with N-glycans. Whereas SPPL2a, -2b, and -2c contain a signal sequence, SPP and SPPL3 contain a type I signal anchor sequence for initiation of protein translocation and membrane insertion. The hydrophilic loops joining the transmembrane regions, which contain the catalytic residues, are facing the exoplasm. The C termini of all these proteins are exposed toward the cytosol. Taken together, our study demonstrates that SPP and its homologues are all of the same principal structure with a catalytic domain embedded in the membrane in opposite orientation to that of presenilins. Other than presenilins, SPPL2a, -2b, -2c, and -3 are therefore predicted to cleave type II-oriented substrate peptides like the prototypic protease SPP.

Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) as prototypic members. PSs and SPP belong to the family of GXGD aspartic proteases (12Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Martoglio B. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R201-R206Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although the sequence homology is limited, sequences of PSs and SPP can be aligned almost throughout the entire length (14Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). They are membrane proteins with multiple predicted transmembrane regions, two of which contain the active site motifs YD and GXGD, a unique trait specific for this protease family. These structural similarities make a case for a common catalytic mechanism. Indeed, a number of protease inhibitors, including aspartic protease transition state analogues, targeted PSs and SPP and inhibited both activities (15Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A. Paganetti P. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16528-16533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Despite common features, there are major differences between PSs and SPP. PSs undergo endoproteolysis for activation and appear to act as proteolytic subunits of a multiprotein complex called γ-secretase (16Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 17De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 18Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). For SPP activity, in contrast, there is no indication for a requirement neither for endoproteolytic activation nor for additional components (11Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). One of the most striking differences, however, is the apparent opposite orientation of the catalytic domains within the plane of the membrane (11Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Transmembrane regions containing the catalytic aspartates have opposite orientation in PSs when compared with corresponding transmembrane regions in SPP. Because PSs are known to catalyze intramembrane cleavage of several type I anchored membrane proteins (e.g. β-amyloid precursor protein and Notch-1) (19Kopan R. Ilagan M.X.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), whereas SPP cuts type II-oriented transmembrane peptides (e.g. signal sequences, hepatitis C virus core protein precursor), the orientation of the respective catalytic site seems predictive for the orientation of the relevant substrates. Besides the two PSs and SPP, the human genome contains four additional candidate GXGD proteases, which have been recognized by data base searching (11Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 14Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol.

Biochemistry (Moscow). 2002; 67: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These proteins, referred to as PSH (for PS homologues) (14Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), IMPAS (for intramembrane proteases) (20Grigorenko A.P. Moliaka Y.K. Korovaitseva G.I. Rogaev E.I. Biochemistry (Moscow). 2002; 67: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), or SPPLs (for SPP-like proteases) (11Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), have no identified function. Like the PSs and SPP, they are proteins with multiple predicted transmembrane regions. SPP and SPPLs share high homology particularly in the C-terminal half of the molecules, which contain the catalytic motifs and the conserved sequence QPALLY (11Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 14Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because of this structural homology, it is likely that these proteins have the same enzymatic activity, namely that of an intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease. The divergence observed in the N-terminal portions may be a determinant of their individual function. In the present study we have investigated the topologies of SPP and the homologous human SPPLs. After cloning the respective cDNAs, we expressed the proteins in a cell-free in vitro system and in living cells, and we determined the topological function of the most N-terminal hydrophobic region and the localization of the N- and C-terminal portions. Furthermore, we determined the localization of the hydrophilic loops that connect the two transmembrane regions containing the catalytic aspartate residues. The topology of the latter is crucial for the future search for substrates of the SPPLs, because experimental data on PSs and SPP suggest that the topology of the catalytic domain correlates with the membrane orientation of the respective substrates. Cloning SPPLs and Plasmid Constructs—Total RNA was isolated from SH-SY5Y and HEK293 cells using GlassMax kit (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen). On the bases of available sequence information (for accession numbers see Fig. 1A), SPPL2a and SPPL3 cDNAs were amplified using primer pairs, 5′-TTAACTAGCTAGCCAGTCCGATGGGGCCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGCTCCCGATTCCTGGAAGTATAATCTAGAGC-3′ (reverse), and 5′-GGCTCGAGATGGCGGAGCAGACCTACTCGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGCTCCCGATTCCTGGAAGTATAATCTAGAGC-3′ (reverse), respectively. SPPL2b cDNA was amplified from a human dorsal root ganglion cDNA library (Invitrogen) and SPPL2c cDNA from a brain cDNA library (K. Kaupmann, Novartis) using the primer sets, 5′-GAATTCATGGCGGCAGCGGTGGCGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGCCTGGCGCCTCGGCCTAATCTAGAC-3′ (reverse), and 5′-GGCTCGAGATGGCGTGCCTGGGCTTCCTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGCTCCCGATTCCTGGAAGTATAATCTAGAGC-3′ (reverse), respectively. The amplified products were cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pSV-Sport1 (Invitrogen). Mutations and HA tags were introduced by overlap extension PCR. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Microarray Analysis—Human tissues, total RNA samples, and mRNA samples were obtained from Clinomics Biosciences, Inc., Clontech, AllCells, LLC, Clonetics/BioWhittaker, AMS Biotechnology, and the University of California, San Diego. The quality of all samples was determined with an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Microarray analysis was performed as described (21Su A.I. Cooke M.P. Ching K.A. Hakak Y. Walker J.R. Wiltshire T. Orth A.P. Vega R.G. Sapinoso L.M. Moqrich A. Patapoutian A. Hampton G.M. Schultz P.G. Hogenesch J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA that was then used as a template to generate biotinylated cRNA. cRNA was fragmented and added to Affymetrix HGU133A chips and the custom human chip GNF1b from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, according to the standard protocol outlined in the Gene Chip Expression Analysis Technical Manual of Affymetrix. After sample hybridization, microarrays were washed and scanned with an Agilent laser scanner. Affymetrix Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS5) was used to generate .CHP files. Expression values provided are the average from duplicate measures generated by taking two male and two female samples. In Vitro Transcription, Translation, and Translocation—To prepare mRNA coding for “x+100” constructs, the respective coding region was amplified with PCR using pSV-Sport1 plasmids as templates, DyNAzyme Polymerase (Finnzymes), SP6 primer, and a reverse primer, starting with 5′-N6CTAN20-3′ to introduce a TAG stop codon at the desired position (22Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To prepare template for SPPL3Ng x+100, a forward primer containing the SP6 promotor and Kozak sequence 5′-CGTATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATACCATG... followed by 9 bases coding for a consensus site for N-glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser) and 20 bases overlapping the template was used. PCR products were transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase at 42 °C in the presence of 500 μm m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G RNA CAP structure analogue (New England Biolabs). mRNAs were translated in 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Promix; Amersham Biosciences) and, where indicated, 2 eq of nuclease-treated rough microsomes prepared from dog pancreas and 30 μmN-benzoyl-Asn-Leu-Thr-methylamide to prevent N-glycosylation (23Martoglio B. Hauser S. Dobberstein B. Celis J.E. 2nd Ed. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 265-274Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Microsomes were extracted with 500 mm KOAc and subjected to SDS-PAGE (22Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Expression in Tissue Culture Cells and Deglycosylation—HeLa cells were plated at 50% confluence in 6-well plates in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected the following day using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). In brief, 1 μg of plasmid and 3 μl of the reagent were used for each transfection, and cells were incubated for 9 h with medium containing DNA complexes. Thereafter, the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in PBS containing 0.5% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). For deglycosylation, lysates were treated with N-glycosidase F (PNGase F, New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 3 h according to the manufacturer's protocol but without denaturing. Selective Permeabilization and Indirect Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were plated on 12-mm coverslips in 6-well plates the day before transfection. 9 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, treated for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, and washed with PBS. Cells were next selectively permeabilized by incubating for 15 min at 4 °C in 5 μg/ml digitonin, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.8. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with PBS and thereafter incubated with blocking solution (4% fetal calf serum in PBS) at room temperature for 30 min. Control cells were treated the same way, but 0.2% saponin was added to the blocking solution. For immunofluorescence, coverslips were washed three times with PBS and incubated with primary mouse monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA; Covance) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against ERP57 or the cytosolic tail of calnexin (A. Helenius, ETHZ) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor488 and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor594, Molecular Probes) in blocking solution. After washing three times with PBS, coverslips were rinsed with water and mounted with IMMU-MOUNT (Thermo-Shandon). Samples were visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M fluorescence microscope. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Tris-glycine acrylamide gels (12% T, 2.7% C for Figs. 2B, 3, and 4, SPP and SPPL3; 10% T, 2.7% C for Fig. 4B, SPPL2a, -2b) and a Tris-Bicine urea acrylamide gel (6% T, 3–6% linear gradient C for Fig. 4B, SPPL2c) (22Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled proteins were visualized by a PhosphorImager (STORM 860, Amersham Biosciences). For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were blocked with 5% milk powder in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were probed with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Covance), and bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Fig. 3Localization of N-terminal extensions investigated in vitro. A, schematic illustration of constructs used for the in vitro experiments. For each protein, the N-terminal portion comprising the hydrophilic N-terminal extension, the first hydrophobic region (see Table I) plus the downstream 100 residues (“+100”) were synthesized by cell-free in vitro translation.

Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Martoglio B. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R201-R206Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Searching the data bank revealed a number of additional candidate GXGD proteases present in the genome of organisms of all kingdoms; many are hypothetical proteins with unassigned function. Phylogenetic tree analysis clusters these sequences into different subfamilies (Fig. 1A). SPP and its human homologues appear to be members of three different subfamilies, one containing SPP, one containing SPPL3, and a third family containing three closely related members, SPPL2a, -2b, and -2c. These proteins seem only distantly related to the PSs and TFPPs, suggesting that SPP and its homologues may have structural features and substrate specificities that distinguish them from the PSs. In order to experimentally analyze the relationships of SPP and SPPLs, we cloned the SPPL cDNAs from human cell lines and confirmed the sequences already deposited in the data base (see accession numbers Fig. 1A). By using microarray analysis, we then determined the appearance of SPP and SPPL mRNAs in different human tissues. The resulting profiles indicated the presence of mRNAs coding for SPP, SPPL2a, -2c, and SPPL3 in all major human adult tissues implying a wide distribution of the respective proteins (Fig. 1B). For SPPL2b mRNA, the resulting profile was more restrictive suggesting that SPPL2b is more selectively expressed. We next investigated the sequences of the human proteins SPP, SPPL2a, -2b, and -2c, and SPPL3 by the sequence analysis programs SignalP version 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-2.0/), TMHMM version 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/), HMMTOP version 2.0 (www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/index.html), PSORT II (psort.nibb.ac.jp/form2.html), and TMpred (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html) (Table I). The resulting consensus of membrane protein topology (24Nilsson J. Persson B. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) of SPP and SPPLs predicted a common arrangement of hydrophobic stretches, nine predicted transmembrane regions two of which contain the conserved catalytic motifs, YD and GXGD (Table I and Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the sequences of SPPL2a, -2b, -2c, and 3 contain close to their N terminus an additional hydrophobic region for which prediction programs propose the function of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting signal (25Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In all three proteins, an extended hydrophilic region containing consensus sites for N-glycosylation follows the putative signal sequence (Fig. 2A). In contrast, neither an N-terminal signal sequence nor an extended hydrophilic stretch in the N-terminal part of the protein is predicted for SPP and SPPL3 (Table I and Fig. 2A).Table IConsensus alignment of predicted transmembrane regions Open table in a new tab Expression of SPP and SPPLs in Tissue Culture Cells—To experimentally address the topology of SPP and SPPLs, we first tested expression of cloned proteins in tissue culture cells. We transiently transfected HeLa cells with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged proteins under the control of the SV40 promoter. From the SPPL2a, -2b, and -2c, we expressed proteins containing a C-terminal HA tag, and from the SPP we expressed a construct containing an HA tag directly ahead of the C-terminal KKXX ER retrieval signal (26Townsley F.M. Pelham H.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of proteins was analyzed by Western blotting. Because all investigated proteins contain multiple consensus sites for N-glycosylation (Fig. 2A), we also included treatment with N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). Sensitivity toward PNGase F is indicative of the acquisition of N-glycans and hence exposure of the respective region toward the exoplasm. Expression of SPP resulted in two products, one of ∼45 kDa corresponding to monomeric SPP (Fig. 2B, left panel, asterisk) and one of ∼90 kDa. The latter product most likely represents the dimeric form of SPP which, according to a recent report by Nyborg et al. (27Nyborg A.C. Kornilova A.Y. Jansen K. Ladd T.B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15153-15160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), shows up on SDS-PAGE upon mild solubilization in sample buffer. Both products were sensitive to treatment with PNGase F, which reduced the apparent size of the products to ∼38 and ∼80 kDa, respectively. This shift is consistent with the removal of two N-glycan moieties from the N-terminal domain. Similar results were obtained for SPPL2a, -2b, and -2c. For these three proteins we obtained products of about 75 kDa (Fig. 2B, right panel, asterisks), which were all sensitive to treatment with PNGase F (for the analysis of SPPL2c samples, see also the optimized gel system shown in Fig. 4B). The observed reductions in size are in agreement with the removal of the expected number of oligosaccharides from the N-terminal domain, up to 8 for SPPL2a, 3 for SPPL2b, and 1 or 2 for SPPL2c (the most N-terminal one is very close to the N terminus where glycosylation is typically inefficient; see e.g.Fig. 3B, SPPL3Ng, x+100). Expression of SPPL3 did not yield a glycoprotein as revealed by the lack of sensitivity toward PNGase F (Fig. 2B, left panel). The product showed unexpected high electrophoretic mobility (∼30 kDa) but nevertheless corresponded to the full-length protein as demonstrated by comparison with in vitro translated SPPL3 (Fig. 2B, left panel, IVT). Also for SPPL3 a potentially dimeric form migrating at ∼60 kDa was observed, particularly when cells were lysed under mild conditions (Triton X-100; no heating; Fig. 2B, left panel, TX100). Taken together, these results indicate that the N-terminal hydrophilic domains of SPP and SPPLs are exposed toward the exoplasm and, with the exception of the one of SPPL3, modified with N-glycans. Topological Function of Most N-terminal Hydrophobic Regions—We next analyzed the localization of the mature N termini and the topology of the first hydrophobic regions in more detail by using a cell-free in vitro translation/translocation system. The most N-terminal hydrophobic region of a multi-spanning membrane protein usually mediates targeting to the ER membrane and induces integration into the lipid bilayer. Such a “first” hydrophobic region may function as sole signal sequence that is cleaved off from the pre-protein once integration of the polypeptide chain into the membrane has been initiated (25Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the mature protein then becomes located outside the cell in the exoplasm. Alternatively, the first hydrophobic region may function as a signal anchor sequence that also promotes targeting and membrane insertion, but is not removed, and eventually functions as a membrane anchor. Signal anchor sequences can integrate into the lipid bilayer either in a type I orientation, i.e. the N-terminal portion is translocated through the bilayer and becomes exposed toward the exoplasm, whereas the C-terminal portion remains in the cytoplasm or in a type II orientation, i.e. the N terminus remains in the cytosol whereas the C-terminal portion becomes translocated (25Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). For SPP, we have previously reported that its first hydrophobic region functions as a type I signal anchor sequence (11Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Translocation of the N-terminal hydrophilic extension of the SPP is indicated by the acquisition of N-glycans at the two consensus sites for N-glycosylation present in this region (Fig. 3, A and B, asterisks versus arrow). To test whether the first N-terminal regions of the SPPLs are similarly integrated into membranes as the one of SPP, we made use of the classic cell-free in vitro translation/translocation system comprising reticulocyte lysate for protein synthesis and ER-derived rough microsomes for membrane insertion (28Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In the presence of [35S]methionine, we translated mRNA of each SPPL coding for the N-terminal hydrophilic extension, the first hydrophobic region, plus the downstream 100 residues (Fig. 3A, x+100 constructs). Sequence analysis programs predict the function of a signal sequence for the first hydrophobic region of SPPL2a, -2b, and -2c, and consensus sites for N-glycosylation within the downstream 100 residues. Indeed, when the respective “x+100” constructs were translated in the in vitro assay, products of higher molecular weight appeared in the presence of microsomes when compared with samples where microsomes were not added (Fig. 3B, asterisks versus arrows). These higher molecular weight products were not produced when the acceptor tripeptide glycosylation inhibitor N-benzoyl-Asn-Leu-Thr-methylamide (29Lau J.T. Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Naider F.

Caspases are an evolutionarily conserved family of aspartate-specific cysteine-dependent proteases that are synthesized as pro-enzymes with a p20 and a p10 domain. Upon binding to the appropriate platform, these domains undergo a conformational change resulting in the formation of the active enzyme (1Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H.

Although caspase-1 is mainly known for the maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, the marked resistance of caspase-1-deficient animals to endotoxin shock induced by high doses of LPS (4Kuida K.

Mice deficient in IL-1β display no resistance to LPS-induced endotoxin shock (6Shornick L.P. De Togni P. Mariathasan S. Goellner J. Strauss-Schoenberger J. Karr R.W. Ferguson T.A. Chaplin D.D. J.

Additional caspase-1-mediated functions, such as the recently described caspase-1 CARD-dependent activation of NF-κB (9Lamkanfi M. Kalai M. Saelens X. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24785-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), may therefore help explaining the phenotype of caspase-1 knockout mice. Nevertheless, pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 play major roles in a wide variety of inflammatory conditions in vivo (10Dinarello C.A. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2002; 20: S1-S13PubMed Google Scholar). The protein complexes in which procaspase-1 is activated and lead to the proteolytic maturation of these cytokines have recently been identified as “inflammasomes” (11Agostini L. Martinon F. Burns K. McDermott M.F. Hawkins P.N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 2004; 20: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 12Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). The molecular composition of the inflammasome complex depends on the identity of the members of the NALP protein family serving as scaffold proteins in the complex. For example, the NALP1 inflammasome uses the adaptor protein ASC/PYCARD to recruit procaspases-1 and -5 (12Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). In contrast to the NALP1 inflammasome, procaspase-5 is not part of the NALP2 and NALP3 inflammasomes (11Agostini L. Martinon F. Burns K. McDermott M.F. Hawkins P.N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 2004; 20: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Except for NALP2 and -3, all components of the inflammasomes possess an oligomerization domain called “caspase recruitment domain” or CARD (13Martinon F. Tschopp J. Cell. 2004; 117: 561-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). This oligomerization domain is also found in several procaspases and in multiple proteins involved in the assembly of large protein platforms that promote the recruitment and proteolytic activation of caspases in the context of apoptosis and inflammation (14Lamkanfi M. Declercq W. Kalai M. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 15Bouchier-Hayes L. Martin S.J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ICEBERG and COP/Pseudo-ICE are two human CARD-only proteins that share a high degree of sequence homology with the prodomain of procaspase-1, reaching 93 and 73%, respectively (16Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34495-34500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Both ICEBERG and COP/Pseudo-ICE are encoded by caspase-like genes that have acquired premature nonsense mutations leading to the production of essentially CARD-only molecules. These genes map to chromosome 11q22, adjacent to the caspase-1 gene and have probably arisen by recent gene duplication events. Both ICEBERG and COP/Pseudo-ICE bind to and prevent procaspase-1 activation and the subsequent generation of IL-1β (16Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34495-34500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to ICEBERG, COP/Pseudo-ICE also interacts with RIP2 in a CARD-CARD-dependent manner and activates the transcription factor NF-κB (9Lamkanfi M. Kalai M. Saelens X. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24785-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Using bioinformatics approaches, we have identified a novel human gene that encodes a CARD-containing protein, which we termed INCA (INhibitory CARD). Similar to ICEBERG and COP/Pseudo-ICE, the INCA protein is relatively short (110 amino acids), composed essentially of only a CARD domain that shares 81% sequence identity with the prodomain of procaspase-1. We demonstrate that INCA binds to procaspase-1 and inhibits LPS-induced release of IL-1β from macrophages. In contrast to COP/Pseudo-ICE and procaspase-1, INCA does not bind to RIP2 and does not induce NF-κB activation. Moreover, INCA does not prevent NF-κB activation by either COP/Pseudo-ICE or the prodomain of procaspase-1. All together, INCA is a newly identified intracellular regulator of procaspase-1 activation implicated in the regulation of the proteolytic maturation of pro-IL-1β and its release during inflammation. Isolation of INCA cDNA—The INCA gene was found by searching the GenBank™ High Throughput Genomic Sequence data base for sequences similar to the prodomain of procaspase-1, using the BLASTn program. The hypothetical cDNA sequence coding for INCA was assembled using several bioinformatics programs. The cDNA coding for INCA was amplified by RT-PCR from different human tissues and cell lines using the forward primer 5′-CGAGGAGGGATCCTAGCCATGGCCGACAAGGTCCTGAAGGAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGAACTCTCGAGAACCTAGGAAGGAAGTACTATTTGAG-3′. The obtained cDNAs were cloned into pCAGGS and sequenced, confirming the in silico prediction. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—HeLa cells and the human monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1 were cultured according to the supplier's instructions. THP-1 cells were seeded at 4 × 105 cells/ml medium and U937 cells at 2 × 105 cells/ml medium in a six-well plate. After 36 h, the cells were either left untreated or stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml), human TNF-α (1000 IU/ml), human IFN-γ (1000 IU/ml), or combinations of these stimuli for an additional 12 h. Total RNA was isolated from cells with the RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA libraries were made according to the instructions for the SuperScript PreAmplification system (Invitrogen). Levels of RNA were normalized using UV-spectrophotometry at 260-nm wavelength and β-actin-specific control primers. For RT-PCR analysis of INCA mRNA, cDNA samples derived from multiple human adult tissues (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD) were amplified using INCA-specific primers 5′-GGATCCTAGCCATGGCCGACAAGGTCCTGAAGGAG-3′ (INCA-forward) and 5′-TGAACTCTCGAGAACCTAGGAAGGAAGTACTATTTGAG-3′ (INCA-reverse). The resultant PCR products were size-fractionated by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels, and then stained with ethidium bromide for UV photography. To verify the identity of the amplified product, the amplified band was excised from gels, purified, and sequenced. Expression Plasmids—pNF-conLuc, encoding the luciferase reporter gene driven by a minimal NF-κB responsive promoter, was a gift from Dr. A. Israël (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The plasmid pUT651, encoding β-galactosidase, was from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). The plasmid encoding a dominant negative IKK-β was a gift from Dr. J. Schmid (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria). Plasmids encoding T7-epitope-tagged COP/Pseudo-ICE and ICEBERG have been described previously (16Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. E. S. Alnemri (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The cDNAs for FLAG-epitope-tagged COP/Pseudo-ICE and INCA were generated by PCR and cloned into the pFBneo retroviral vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCR-generated cDNAs encoding human RIP2, COP/Pseudo-ICE, ICEBERG, human caspase-2 CARD, and the enzymatically inactive human procaspase-1 C285A mutant were all cloned in-frame with the E-epitope tag of the pCAGGS-E vector. All the PCR products described above were checked by sequencing to ensure that no errors had been introduced by PCR. Transfection, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting Assay— 293T is a human embryonal kidney carcinoma cell line. 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (19O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded the day before transfection at 2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected for 4 h, washed, and incubated for another 24 h, before lysates were prepared by harvesting the cells and lysing them in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates (0.5 ml) were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) in combination with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads, prewashed with lysis buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Immune-complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were subsequently incubated with anti-E-epitope tag antibody (Amersham Biosciences), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and detection by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method. Alternatively, after normalization for total protein content, lysates were analyzed directly by immunoblotting using various antibodies, including anti-caspase-1 CARD antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-T7 epitope tag antibodies (Novagen, Madison, WI). Retroviral Infection of THP-1 Cells—Retroviral particles were produced by transfecting the amphotropic packaging cell line Phoenix (kindly provided by Dr. G. P. Nolan, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA) with pFBneo, pFBneo-FLAG-INCA, or pFBneo-FLAG-COP/Pseudo-ICE vectors using the calcium phosphate/chloroquine method. The next day cultures were refreshed. Culture supernatants containing retroviral particles were collected 24 h later and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane. 1 ml of viral supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of DOTAP (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min on ice. The monocytic cell line THP1 was cultured at 37 °C under 6% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 μm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (10–5m). For infection, THP1 cells (106 cells/well) were centrifuged in the presence of 1 ml of retrovirus enriched with DOTAP in a 6-well plate for 45 min at 1,200 rpm at 24 °C. Plates were placed back in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C, 6 h later fresh medium was added, and the cells were kept in culture for 18 h. THP1 cells were subjected to a total of three cycles of infection followed by 1 week of culture. Cells were then selected using 1.5 mg/ml neomycin (Invitrogen). After 4 weeks of selection, the cultures were expanded, and expression of FLAG-INCA and FLAG-COP/Pseudo-ICE was verified by Western blot analysis. IL-1β Bio-assay—Control THP-1 cells, or those expressing FLAG-INCA or FLAG-COP/Pseudo-ICE, were stimulated with the indicated amounts of LPS for 48 h. Release of biologically active IL-1β was determined using growth factor-dependent D10(N4)M cells as described previously (9Lamkanfi M. Kalai M. Saelens X. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol.

Quantification of NF-κB Activity—293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors in combination with 100 ng of NF-κB-luciferase and pUT651-β-galactosidase reporter plasmids. In some experiments, cells were treated for 6 h with 500 IU/ml of TNF-α prior to harvesting. Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in Tris phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 7.8) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. After addition of 50 μl of substrate buffer (658 μm luciferin, 378 mm co-enzyme A, and 742 μm ATP) to 20 μl of cell lysate, NF-κB activity was assayed in a TopCount NXT microplate scintillation reader (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). To normalize transfection efficiency, cell lysates were also subjected to β-galactosidase colorimetric assay. In brief, cell lysate (20 μl) was incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 200 μl of a solution containing 0.9 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 1 mm MgCl2, 45 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The optical density was read at a wavelength of 595 nm. Results are expressed as relative luciferase units per second/optical density for β-galactosidase activity. The data represent the average ± S.E. of triplicates and are representative of at least three independent experiments. Identification of INCA—To identify new CARD-containing proteins, we searched the GenBank™ High Throughput Genomic Sequence data base for sequences that share significant homology with the prodomain of human caspase-1 (residues 1–100). Using this approach, four different genomic clones (GenBank™ accession numbers AP002787, AC027011, AP001024, and AC021452) containing a new CARD-containing gene were found. The identified gene, which we named INCA (Inhibitory CARD), maps to human chromosome 11q22. Interestingly, the genes coding for caspase-1, the related CARD-proteins ICEBERG and COP/Pseudo-ICE and caspases-4, -5 and -12 all reside on this locus. According to the public data base of Human Genome Browser (genome.ucsc.edu/), the order of these genes from centromere to telomere is caspase-12, caspase-4, caspase-5, caspase-1, COP/Pseudo-ICE, INCA, and ICEBERG (Fig. 1A). Because INCA shares high sequence homology with the genes encoding caspase-1, COP/Pseudo-ICE, and ICEBERG, it is likely that INCA arose from a duplication of one of these homologous genes. To deduce the putative cDNA sequence of INCA, we aligned its genomic sequence with the cDNA sequences of procaspase-1, COP/Pseudo-ICE, and ICEBERG to predict potential exons and intron/exon boundaries. The results of this approach largely matched those obtained using de novo gene prediction methods such as GenScan and GeneMark.hmm. The predicted INCA cDNA sequence is composed of four exons (Fig. 1B) with all intron/exon boundaries conforming to the consensus GT/AG rule (Fig. 1C). The open reading frame spans from the first to the third exon, the latter of which encodes an in-frame stop codon (Fig. 1B). Only the first two amino acids are encoded in the first exon, and the last 18 amino acids are encoded by exon 3. Therefore, exon 2 encodes most of the open reading frame, including the CARD domain. Exon 4 does not code for amino acids, because it resides downstream of the in-frame stop codon at the end of exon 3, and thus functions as a 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1B). The deduced amino acid sequence of INCA shares 81% sequence identity with the CARD-domain of procaspase-1. These data show that the INCA gene probably encodes a protein of 110 amino acids (Fig. 1D), which essentially consists of a CARD domain (residues 1–91). INCA is therefore comparable to the related CARD-only proteins COP/Pseudo-ICE, ICEBERG, and human caspase-12 (Fig. 1E) (22Fischer H. Koenig U. Eckhart L. Tschachler E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 722-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 23Lamkanfi M. Kalai M. Vandenabeele P.

Nature. 2004; 429: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), all of which are encoded by genes residing on the same chromosomal locus. Tissue Expression of INCA—Using the nucleotide or amino acid sequences of INCA as a query for BLAST searches of the GenBank™ data base, no expressed sequence tag sequences corresponding to INCA could be identified (data not shown). To experimentally confirm the existence of the predicted INCA mRNA and to study its tissue distribution, we performed RT-PCR analysis using INCA-specific primers on a cDNA panel derived from several normal human tissues and from the human cervix carcinoma cell line HeLa. Parallel PCR analysis of procaspase-1 and β-actin mRNA served as a reference (Fig. 2). INCA-specific primers amplified a PCR product of about 470 bp from several tissues, with the highest expression levels detected in brain, heart, spleen, lung, and salivary gland (Fig. 2). Subsequent DNA sequencing of this PCR product confirmed the predicted INCA cDNA sequence (data not shown). INCA was absent or expressed at low levels in various other tissues, including stomach, thyroid, pancreas, prostate and skin, as well as in HeLa cells (Fig. 2). In general, INCA is expressed in most tissues where procaspase-1 is present. However, in a number of tissues, such as salivary gland, INCA is expressed in the absence of procaspase-1 (Fig. 2). This suggests that differential regulation mechanisms at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level control these homologous genes. INCA Is Up-regulated by IFN-γ—To investigate the possible existence of regulation mechanisms shared between procaspase-1 and INCA, we compared the modulation of INCA and procaspase-1 mRNA levels in response to various pro-inflammatory stimuli. Caspase-1 mRNA levels are known to be up-regulated when cells are stimulated with IFN-γ but remain unchanged following LPS or TNF stimulation (25Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y.

Following stimulation of the monocytic cell lines U937 and THP-1, we analyzed the induction profiles of INCA and caspase-1 by RT-PCR using INCA- and procaspase-1-specific primers, respectively (Fig. 3). Procaspase-1 mRNA levels were indeed strongly induced by IFN-γ in both cell lines while remaining largely unchanged in LPS- and TNF-α-stimulated cells (Fig. 3). These results confirm and extend published data on the induction profile of caspase-1 (25Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 26Tamura T. Ueda S. Yoshida M. Matsuzaki M. Mohri H. Okubo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Comparable to procaspase-1, treatment of U937 or THP-1 cells with IFN-γ leads to a significant up-regulation of INCA levels, which remain unchanged in LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 3). These results indicate that procaspase-1 and INCA mRNA levels are both specifically up-regulated by IFN-γ. Interestingly, we noticed that TNF-α is capable of down-regulating the IFN-γ-induced up-regulation of procaspase-1 and INCA in both THP-1 and U937 cells (Fig. 3). In both cell lines, we observed that this IFN-γ-modulating effect of TNF-α is more pronounced for INCA than for procaspase-1 (Fig. 3). All together, these results suggest that INCA and procaspase-1 mRNA levels are modulated in similar ways. Identification of INCA-interacting Proteins—The prodomain of procaspase-1 is required for dimerization and activation of the zymogen (29Van Criekinge W. Beyaert R. Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P.

Because INCA shares a high degree of amino acid sequence identity with the prodomain of procaspase-1 (Fig. 1), we tested the possibility that INCA interacts with procaspase-1 in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Interactions with several CARD-containing proteins were also tested, including INCA itself, and the related CARD-only proteins ICEBERG and COP/Pseudo-ICE. The unrelated CARD domain of procaspase-2 was used as a negative control for the co-immunoprecipitation assays. For these experiments, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged INCA in combination with various other expression plasmids producing E-tagged CARD-containing proteins. Immunoprecipitations were then performed with anti-FLAG antibody, and the resulting immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-E antibody. Aliquots of the lysates were also analyzed directly by immunoblotting to verify the production of each protein. E-INCA co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-INCA, indicating that this protein can self-associate (Fig. 4A). In addition, E-procaspase-1 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-INCA (Fig. 4B), suggesting that INCA can bind to the prodomain of procaspase-1. Note that the active site cysteine of procaspase-1 was mutated to alanine for these co-immunoprecipitation experiments to avoid induction of apoptosis. Finally, the CARD-only proteins COP/Pseudo-ICE and ICEBERG also co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-INCA (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that these highly related CARD domains that bind to the prodomain of procaspase-1 can also cross-associate with the similar CARD domain present in INCA. E-procaspase-2 CARD also did not co-immunoprecipitate with FLAG-INCA (Fig. 4E), thus demonstrating the specificity of these results. Because it has been demonstrated that procaspase-1 and COP/Pseudo-ICE interact with the CARD-containing kinase RIP2 to induce NF-κB activation (9Lamkanfi M. Kalai M. Saelens X. Declercq W.

We screened a rat skeletal muscle cDNA library using yeast two-hybrid system and found that TCTP interacts with the third large cytoplasmic domain of α1 as well as α2 isoforms of Na,K-ATPase, believed involved in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity. Interaction between TCTP and Na,K-ATPase was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in yeast and mammalian cells. We also showed, using 86Rb+ uptake assay, that overexpression of TCTP inhibited Na,K-ATPase activity in HeLa cells. Northern and Western blotting studies of HeLa cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged TCTP showed that overexpression of TCTP did not change mRNA and protein levels of Na,K-ATPase. Recombinant TCTP protein purified from an Escherichia coli expression system inhibited purified HeLa cell plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase in a dose-dependent manner. Using deletion analysis, we also found that the C-terminal 102–172-amino-acid region of rat TCTP that contains the TCTP homology region 2 is essential for its association with, and inhibition of, Na,K-ATPase.

Na,K-ATPase, a multimembrane-spanning enzyme, is essential for maintaining transmembrane gradients of Na+ and K+ ions and thus for cell homeostasis (1Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These ionic gradients serve to control essential cellular processes such as cell volume, membrane potential, and nutrient transport (2Ullrich K.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1979; 41: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, Na,K-ATPase is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, heart and vascular muscle contraction, and neurotransmitter and hormone secretion (3Bertorello A.M. Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F743-F755PubMed Google Scholar). Thus dysfunction of this enzyme can profoundly affect cell function. Na,K-ATPase is composed of a catalytic 110-kDa α subunit and a glycosylated 40–60-kDa β subunit. The α subunit contains binding sites for cations, ATP, and cardiac glycosides. It has been suggested that there might exist a diffusible cytoplasmic regulator of Na,K-ATPase activity, possibly modulated by protein kinases and hormones (4Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr.

We looked for other cytoplasmic agents that might interact with the CD3 of Na,K-ATPase α subunit and regulate its activity and found that translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) acts as a cytoplasmic repressor of Na,K-ATPase. TCTP is a growth-related protein, under tight transcriptional as well as translational control (13Bommer U.A. Lazaris-Karastzas A. De Benedetii A. Nurnberg P. Benndorf R. Bielka H. Sonenberg N. Cell.

It occurs as a 23-kDa protein in humans and has a 21-kDa homologue in mice but shows no significant homology with any other family of proteins. Based on structural studies of TCTP from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, it has been recently proposed that TCTP belongs to the MSS4/DSS4 superfamily of proteins, which bind to the GDP/GTP-free form of Rab proteins, described as guanine nucleotide-free chaperones (15Thaw P. Baxter N.J. Hounslow A.M. Price C. Waltho J.P. Craven C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). TCTP has no known primary function, but the high degree of homology of TCTP from various sources, including plants and humans, and its expression in many tissues, suggest that it may have a basic housekeeping function (16Sanchez J.C.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screen Assay—The cDNA library was constructed as described previously (10Lee K. Jung J. Kim M. Guidotti G. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). cDNAs of rat Na,K-ATPase α1 and α2 subunits were obtained from Dr. Jerry Lingrel (University of Cincinnati College of Medicine). The CD3 region (Lys-352–Val-l756) of the α2 subunit of Na,K-ATPase was fused into the LexA DNA-binding domain and used as a bait to screen the cDNA library from rat skeletal muscle. Potential positive clones activating the reporter genes were analyzed by restriction mapping and sequencing. One of these clones had DNA sequences that correspond to the gene for rat TCTP, based on a nucleotide BLAST search in NCBI homepage. The sequences coding for the CD3 region (Lys-354–Val-l759) of the α1 subunit were cloned into the pEG202 vector of the LexA fusion plasmid. The PCR fragments of the following were amplified and cloned into the pEG202 vector: the N-terminal portions of α1 (Met-1–Cys-93) and α2 (Met-1–Cys-91); α1CD2 (Glu-151–Ile-292) and α2CD2 (Glu-149–Ile-290) encoding the H2–H3 loop; α1CD4 (Glu-825–Arg-848) and α2CD4 (Glu-822–Arg-845) encoding the H6–H7 loop; the C-terminal portions of α1 (Ile-935–Tyr–1023) and α2 (Ile-932–Tyr-1020); and the N-terminal portion of β subunit (Ala-1–Lys-33). Yeast cells, EGY48/pSH18–34, containing LexAop-LEU2 and Lex-Aop-LacZ reporters were transformed simultaneously with both one of the resulting LexA fusions and a rat TCTP clone using the high efficiency transformation method. Protein-protein interaction results in trans-activation of the LexAop-LEU2 and LexAop-LacZ reporter genes (10Lee K. Jung J. Kim M. Guidotti G. Biochem.

Therefore, individual transformants of the yeast cells were tested on glucose Ura–His–Trp–Leu–, galactose Ura–His–Trp–Leu–, glucose Ura–His–Trp– X-Gal and galactose Ura–His–Trp– X-Gal plates. β-galactosidase activity was determined as reported previously (18Himmelfarb H.J.

Briefly, yeast cells cultured in glucose Ura–His–Trp– and galactose Ura–His–Trp– media were collected at 3,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended by vortexing with yeast lysis buffer (YLB) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm ZnCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture) and glass beads. After adding radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), the mixtures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Affinity-purified anti-hemagglutinin (HA) 12CA5 antibody was added to the supernatants, and the mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Fifty percent protein A-agarose solution (Roche Applied Science) was then added, and incubation continued overnight at 4 °C. After a 5-s centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the pellets were washed twice with the radioimmune precipitation buffer and then with a wash buffer (1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The pellets were then resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The blots obtained were incubated with the anti-LexA antibody. Immunoprecipitations from extracts of HeLa cells were performed according to Jung et al. (19Jung J. Yoon T. Choi E.C. Lee K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48931-48937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The deletion mutants, TCTP-(1–101) and TCTP-(102–172), were constructed with Exsite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The deletion cDNA constructs were PCR-amplified from GFP-TCTP using the following 5′-phosphorylated primers: for TCTP-(1–101), 5′-GCCCTTGAGTGATTTCATGTAGTCTTT-3′ (antisense) and phospho-5′-CAGTCGACGGTACCGCGGGCCCGGGAT-3′ (sense), and for TCTP-(102–171), phospho-5′-CATGGTGACGGAATTCGAAGCTTGAG-3′ (antisense) and 5′-AAACTTGAAGAACAGAAACCAGAAAGG-3′ (sense). After transient transfections with HA-tagged TCTP, GFP, GFPTCTP, and GFP-TCTP-(1–101) and GFP-TCTP-(102–172) constructs in the LipofectAMINE PLUS™ reagent (Invitrogen), HeLa cells were incubated with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice and homogenized with a Pyrex glass homogenizer. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants (1 mg/ml) were preabsorbed with protein G-agarose or protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h at 4 °C. Anti-HA antibody or anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h and incubated with protein G-agarose or protein A-agarose overnight on a rocking platform at 4 °C. The bound immune complexes so obtained were pelleted and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer, and separated on SDS-PAGE. The blots obtained were incubated with anti-Na,K-ATPase α1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and anti-GFP antibody. Measurement of 86Rb+Uptake—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with GFP, GFP-TCTP, and GFP-TCTP-(1–101) and GFP-TCTP-(102–172) constructs and plated in 24-well dishes at 4 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, the cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 2 h at 37 °Cin serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were subsequently washed three times with Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRP, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1.4 mm CaCl2, and 2.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated with or without 1 mm ouabain and/or 0.1 mm furosemide in the Krebs-Ringer buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. 86Rb+ was added to a final concentration of 2 μCi/ml, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C. 86Rb+ uptake was terminated by washing thrice with ice-chilled Krebs-Ringer buffer. The cells were then lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm NaOH, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The radioactivity of the cell lysates was determined after adding scintillation mixture solution. Protein concentration per well was determined according to Peterson's modification of the Lowry assay (20Fehlmann M. Freychet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7449-7453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and averaged. For this, cells contained in three wells were taken through the procedure without the addition of label. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from TCTP-transfected HeLa cells using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and ultraviolet cross-linked. Hybridization was performed using ExpressHyb™ hybridization solution (Clontech). To determine Na,K-ATPase α1 transcription, a 641-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 271–911 of human Na,K-ATPase α1 cDNA was cloned after reverse transcription-PCR, using the RNA obtained as above as template, and labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After hybridization and washing, the membranes were analyzed by Imaging plate autoradiography system (Fuji) and normalized with β-actin mRNA. Measurement of Na,K-ATPase Activity in Vitro—The plasma membrane fraction was obtained as described in a previous report (21Coppi M.V. Guidotti G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 0.2 mg/ml of plasma membrane fraction at 30% sucrose was incubated with various concentrations of ouabain (10–9–10–3m), recombinant TCTP (0.1–100 μg/ml), or recombinant TCTP alone in assay buffer containing 18 mm histidine, 18 mm imidazole, 80 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCI2, and 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, for 20 min at 37 °C. The assay was then started with the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 5 mm in 100 μl/well of a 96-well plate. Following incubation for 40 min at 37 °C, the release of inorganic phosphate from ATP was quantified using the colorimetric method of Fiske and Subbarow (22Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The reactions were read on the Bio-tek FL-600 plate reader at 630 nm. The absorbance values obtained were converted to activity values by linear regression using a standard curve of sodium monobasic phosphate that was included in the assay procedure. Total Na,K-ATPase activity was determined by subtracting the amount of inorganic phosphate resulting from incubation with TCTP alone from that with Na,K-ATPase plus TCTP. Specific activity of Na,K-ATPase was 27.9 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/h. Deletion Analysis of TCTP—N-terminal deletion constructs of TCTP, namely 23–172 (ΔA), 64–172 (ΔB), 102–172 (ΔC), 126–172 (ΔD), and 102–125 (ΔE), were made by removing the relevant sequences from the N terminus of full strength rat TCTP (amino acid residues 1–172). Constructs ΔA and ΔB corresponded to clones 734 and 734B described previously (23Yoon T. Jung J. Kim M. Lee K.M. Choi E.C. Lee K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Construct ΔC was clone 292, isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening conducted in the present study. Two derivatives, ΔD and ΔE, were constructed by PCR and subcloned into the pJG4–5 library vector to generate the deletion constructs of TCTP. The N-terminal regions of different constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the expression of fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with the 12CA5 antibody against the HA epitope. The binding activity of the deletion mutants was determined by β-galactosidase assay. TCTP Interacts with the Third Cytoplasmic Domain of Na,K-ATPase α Subunit—Using the LexA DNA-binding domain CD3 of the Na,K-ATPase α2 subunit fusion in a yeast two-hybrid screening, several cDNA clones were isolated from the rat skeletal muscle library. One of these clones encoded a polypeptide of 172 amino acids with a molecular mass of 21 kDa, originally identified as TCTP. The cytoplasmic domains of Na,K-ATPase were amplified by PCR and cloned into the LexA fusion plasmid, pEG202. To identify the cytoplasmic regions of Na,K-ATPase that interact with the expressed TCTP, individual Ura+His+Trp+ transformants were streaked onto glucose Ura–His–Trp–Leu– and galactose Ura–His–Trp–Leu– plates and assayed for β-galactosidase activity (Table I). Transformants of pEG202/α1CD3 and pEG202/α2CD3 with pJG4–5/TCTP activated the transcription of the respective reporter genes (Table I). It is not clear whether the N-terminal portion of Na,K-ATPase interacts with TCTP because the yeast cells transformed with pEG202/α1NT or pEG202/α2NT activated reporter genes in the presence of glucose or galactose. When yeast cells were transformed with pEG202/α1CD2, pEG202/α2CD2, pEG202/α1CD4, pEG202/α2CD4, pEGα202/α1CT, pEGα202/α2CT, and pEG202/β, there was no activation of the LacZ reporter gene in a galactose-dependent colony on Ura–His–Trp–Leu– plates (Table I), suggesting that CD2, CD4, and the C-terminal portion of the α subunit and the cytoplasmic region of the β subunit do not interact with TCTP. These results suggest that TCTP binds to the CD3 region of the α1 and α2 subunit of Na,K-ATPase, and the binding is not α isoform-specific.Table IInteraction of TCTP with the CD3 of Na,K-ATPase α1 and α2 subunits in yeast two-hybrid systemNa,K-ATPase subunitConstructSelective media plateβ-galactosidase activity (unit)aThe β-galactosidase unit = A420 × 1,000/t (min) × volume of extract (ml) × protein (μg/ml).pEG202 (DNA-binding)pJG4-5 (Transcription activation)Glc U-H-T-L-Gal U-H-T-L-Glc U-H-T-Gal U-H-T-ControlPositive-+++0328Negative--01α1NT (Met-1—Cys-93)TCTP++212CD2 (Glu-151-Ile-292)--01CD3 (Lys-354—Val-759)-+++0113CD4 (Glu-825—Arg-848)--01CT (Ile-935—Tyr-1023)--01α2NT (Met-1—Cys-91)TCTP++514CD2 (Glu-149—Ile-290)--01CD3 (Lys-352—Val-756)-+++0143CD4 (Glu-822—Arg-845)--01CT (Ile-932—Tyr-1020)--01βCD (Ala-1—Lys-33)TCTP--01a The β-galactosidase unit = A420 × 1,000/t (min) × volume of extract (ml) × protein (μg/ml). Open table in a new tab TCTP Interacts with Na,K-ATPase from Both Yeast and Mammalian Cells—Using the 12CA5 antibody against HA epitope-tagged TCTP, we next examined whether TCTP associates with the α2 subunit and co-precipitates the α2CD3 region of Na,K-ATPase in yeast. Fig. 1A shows SDS-PAGE results obtained by examining immunoprecipitates with anti-LexA antibody to the LexA-fused CD3 region of Na,K-ATPase. The 12CA5 antibody precipitated HA-TCTP, which co-precipitated the LexA-α2CD3 hybrid in Gal media but not in Glc media. The mobilities of the precipitated proteins were identical to those of immunoreactive bands in the yeast extracts that contained LexA-α2CD3 fusion proteins, which were expressed constitutively by alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. These results indicate that TCTP associates with a 68-kDa protein, consistent with the predicted size of α2CD3. To determine whether TCTP and Na,K-ATPase interact in vivo, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with HA epitope-tagged TCTP (Fig. 1B). Western blotting using anti-HA antibody confirmed that the cells expressed 22.3-kDa HA epitope-tagged TCTP (data not shown). Immunoprecipitates were prepared from HeLa cell extracts with anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and blotted with anti-Na,K-ATPase α subunit antibody. HA-tagged TCTP co-precipitated the 100-kDa α subunit of Na,K-ATPase from HA-TCTP-transfected cells but not from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). This confirms that the interaction between the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase and TCTP occurs in vivo also. Overexpression of TCTP in HeLa Cells Inhibits Na,K-ATPase Activity—To understand the role of TCTP in the regulation of the Na,K-ATPase activity, we transiently overexpressed exogenous TCTP in HeLa cells and measured Na,K-ATPase activity using 86Rb+ uptake assay. Because 90% of 86Rb+ uptake in HeLa cells is accounted for by Na,K-ATPase (∼60%) and the Na+,K+,2Cl– cotransport system (∼30%) (24Kort J.J. Koch G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we employed 1 mm ouabain (a specific inhibitor of the Na,K-ATPase) and 0.1 mm furosemide (an inhibitor of the Na+,K+,2Cl– cotransporter). As can be seen in Fig. 2, the activity of Na,K-ATPase of the GFP-TCTP-transfected cells was 22.3 ± 3.3% lower than that of GFP-transfected cells. However, cells overexpressing either GFP or GFP-TCTP showed a similar Na+,K+,2Cl– cotransporter and residual transporter activity. These results suggest that the increased level of TCTP in HeLa cells inhibits 86Rb+ uptake and that this inhibition is due to its effect on the Na,K-ATPase but not on the Na+,K+,2Cl– cotransport system. Overexpression of TCTP in HeLa Cells Does Not Affect Na,K-ATPase at Either mRNA or Protein Levels—Northern blotting using human Na,K-ATPase α1-specific probe demonstrated that the mRNA level of Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit was the same in both GFP and GFP-TCTP-transfected cells, whereas that of TCTP remarkably increased in GFP-TCTP-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). We also determined the level of expression of Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit using α1-specific monoclonal antibodies. The expression level of α1 subunits was the same in GFP as well as GFP-TCTP-transfected cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that an increase in TCTP protein does not affect the expression of Na,K-ATPase α1 subunits. TCTP Reduces in Vitro Na,K-ATP Activity in HeLa Cell Plasma Membrane in a Dose-dependent Manner—The effect of TCTP on membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase was studied using HeLa cell plasma membrane enriched with ouabain-sensitive Na,K-ATPase by removal of extraneous protein. The purified HeLa cell plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase activity decreased with increased concentration of ouabain (IC50 = 2.20 ± 0.37 × 10–8m) (Fig. 4A). The addition of recombinant GST-TCTP to the purified plasma membrane resulted in a significant decrease in Na,K-ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 48 nm) (Fig. 4B), whereas the addition of GST and bovine serum albumin did not (data not shown). It appears that recombinant TCTP protein specifically inhibits HeLa cell plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase activity. C-terminal Homology Region 2 of TCTP (Residues 102–172) Is Essential for Its Association with, and Inhibition of, Na,K-ATPase—To identify the regions of TCTP that interact with the CD3 regions of α1 and α2 subunits of Na,K-ATPase, we introduced full-length TCTP and its deleted constructs (23–172 (ΔA), 64–172 (ΔB), 102–172 (ΔC), 126–172 (ΔD), and 102–125 (ΔE) (Fig. 5A) into yeast cells harboring reporter genes and examined the behavior of these strains in glucose Ura–His–Trp–Leu– and galactose Ura–His–Trp–Leu– media. The proteins expressed by these constructs were first confirmed by Western blotting in yeast extracts transformed with each construct (data not shown). We measured, employing liquid culture β-galactosidase assay, the activity of the LacZ reporter gene in cells grown in glucose- or galactose-containing media. As shown in Fig. 5B, constructs of full-length TCTP, ΔA, ΔB, and ΔC showed similar β-galactosidase activities, suggesting that residues 1–101 are not involved in the interaction with CD3 of Na,K-ATPase. However, β-galactosidase activity of the construct ΔD-(126–172) was reduced 6-fold when compared with that of full-length TCTP, suggesting that residues 102–125 (ΔE) are necessary for the association between TCTP and the CD3 of Na,K-ATPase and for the full expression of the enzyme activity. When we constructed ΔE containing residues 102–125 and determined its effect on β-galactosidase activity, there was an almost complete loss of β-galactosidase activity. It appears that residues 102–172 of TCTP are required for the interaction between TCTP and the CD3 region of the α1 as well as the α2 subunit of Na,K-ATPase. To obtain direct evidence that the C-terminal region of TCTP interacts with Na,K-ATPase in mammalian cells, we subcloned deletion mutants that encode residues 1–101 (N-terminal region) and 102–172 (C-terminal region) and overexpressed them in HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitates with anti-GFP antibody were prepared from HeLa cell extracts expressing the deletion mutants and blotted with anti-Na,K-ATPase α subunit and anti-GFP. As shown in Fig. 6A, full-length TCTP and C-terminal GFP-TCTP formed complexes with the 100-kDa fragment of the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase but not the GFP and N-terminal regions. These results confirm that the C-terminal region of TCTP is essential for its interaction with α subunit of Na,K-ATPase in vivo. We also compared the 86Rb+ uptake of HeLa cells transfected with full-length TCTP with that of HeLa cells transfected with deletion constructs. The 86Rb+ uptake in cells transfected with the full-length and C-terminal regions (102–172) was about 20.6 ± 2.6 and 29.6 ± 3.5%, respectively, lower than in GFP-transfected cells, suggesting that the C-terminal region (102–172) of TCTP is sufficient to reduce the activity of Na,K-ATPase in HeLa cells (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, the Na+,K+,2Cl– cotransporter and residual transporter activities in GFP, GFP-TCTP, GFP-TCTP-(1–101), and GFP-TCTP-(102–172) overexpressing cells were similar (Fig. 6B). These data also suggest that the C-terminal region (102–172) of TCTP is essential for interaction with Na,K-ATPase α subunit and is sufficient to reduce the Na,K-ATPase activity. TCTP has been identified in the proliferative stage of breast tumor (25Gross B. Gaestel M. Bohm H. Bielka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and has been initially reported to be present in all normal cell types, with the exception of kidney cells (16Sanchez J.C. Schaller D. Ravier F. Golaz O. Jaccoud S. Belet M. Wilkins M.R. James R. Deshusses J. Hochstrasser D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, we detected endogenous TCTP in COS-7 cells and rat kidney tissue by Western blotting, 2J. Jung, M. Kim, M.-J. Kim, J. Kim, J. Moon, J.-S. Lim, M. Kim, and K. Lee, unpublished results. and it now appears that TCTP exists in all normal cell types. Also, TCTP is widely distributed and exhibits a high degree of homology among various species. This suggests that this protein must have some essential cellular function. In the present study, we identified TCTP as a Na,K-ATPase-binding protein and as a cytoplasmic repressor of Na,K-ATPase activity. One might speculate that the basic function of TCTP may be to sustain all normal cell types by regulating the Na,K-ATPase activity. Modulation of intracellular ion balance by Na,K-ATPase is an important mechanism by which cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis are regulated in diverse tissues. Recently, evidence has been obtained that moderate inhibition of Na,K-ATPase provides a prosurvival signal in addition to its mitogenic effect, whereas complete inhibition of the enzyme sharply decreases cell survival (26Murata Y. Matsuda T. Tamada K. Hosoi R. Asano S. Takuma K. Tanaka K. Baba A. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 72: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Kaplowitz P.B. Moscona A.A. Cell Differ. 1976; 5: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). TCTP has been shown to bind to the proapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia protein-1, a BCl-2 homologue (28Zhang D. Li F. Weidner D. Mnjoyan Z.H. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Li et al. (29Li F. Zhang D. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47542-47549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) showed that transient overexpression of TCTP in HeLa cells prevented etoposide-induced apoptosis, suggesting that TCTP influences cell survival through its novel anti-apoptotic effect and regulation of apoptosis. Therefore, it seems that reduction of Na,K-ATPase activity resulting from the overexpression of TCTP in HeLa cells is unlikely due to decreased cell viability. Xie and Askari (30Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Na,K-ATPase is a signal transducer, with two distinct but coupled signal transducing pathways. One pathway involves the classical energy transducing ion pump enzymes, whose partial inhibition by ouabain initiates the increase in intracellular Ca2+, whereas the second involves signal transducing enzymes that activate a host of signaling intermediates and increase intracellular reactive oxygen species in cardiac myocytes. It is possible that inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity by TCTP causes an increase in intracellular Na+, which in turn affects the Na+,Ca2+ exchanger, leading to an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Since HeLa cells do not have Na+,Ca2+ exchanger, we are currently studying cardiac myocytes to determine how TCTP raises intracellular Ca2+. ATPase is subject to both short and long term regulation by a variety of phenomena. Long term regulatory mechanisms generally involve de novo Na,K-ATPase synthesis or degradation, whereas short term regulation involves either direct effect on the kinetic behavior of the enzyme or translocation of Na,K-ATPase to the plasma membrane. The reduction of Na,K-ATPase activity described in the present studies is due to binding of Na,K-ATPase to TCTP and not due to changes in Na,K-ATPase synthesis. Because of the possible central role that Na,K-ATPase plays in physiological and pathological phenomena, it is important to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by TCTP. Lingham and Sen (31Lingham R.B. Sen A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were the first to suggest that cAMP-dependent protein kinase requires an intermediate protein to mediate its effect on the Na,K-ATPase in rat brain. It has also been reported that a protein kinase C-mediated decrease in plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase activity is not associated with direct phosphorylation (32Nestor N.B. Lane L.K. Aperia A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). TCTP is a Ca2+-binding protein with four potential phosphorylation sites, one site for protein kinase C and three sites for casein kinase II, according to a ScanProsite search. In addition, it was reported that TCTP is phosphorylated at serine residues 46 and 64 by a polo-like protein kinase that regulates spindle function (33Yarm F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6209-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that TCTP might be regulated by unknown kinases to modulate the Na,K-ATPase activity. McGill and Guidotti (6McGill D.L. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15824-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that both α1 and α2 isoforms of Na,K-ATPase in adipocytes were stimulated by insulin and that this stimulatory effect was lost during the isolation of the membrane, suggesting the presence of a diffusible repressor of Na,K-ATPase, regulated by insulin. It will be of interest to examine whether insulin also plays a role in the regulation of TCTP binding to Na,K-ATPase in adipocytes. It has been reported that TCTP has a tubulin-binding region (residues 80–120) and that TCTP associates transiently with microtubules during the cell cycle (34Gachet Y. Tournier S. Lee M. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Poulton T. Bommer U.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1257-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reported previously that the C-terminal region (126–172) of TCTP is involved in interaction with itself (23Yoon T. Jung J. Kim M. Lee K.M. Choi E.C. Lee K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the C-terminal region of TCTP-(102–172) is essential for its interaction with Na,K-ATPase α subunit and is sufficient to inhibit Na,K-ATPase activity. Thus it seems that TCTP plays multiple roles by interacting with different kinds of proteins through diverse domains. In summary, this is the first demonstration that TCTP is a Na,K-ATPase-binding protein serving as an intracellular inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase activity. TCTP acts on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane, in contrast to ouabain, which inhibits the enzyme by binding to the outer side of the cell membrane. This demonstration of negative regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by TCTP suggests a possible new mechanism for the regulation of the machinery of the cell and for the maintenance of ion homeostasis. Further work is under way to elucidate the precise regulatory role of TCTP. We thank Jihyun Oh for help with yeast two-hybrid screening assay and deletion analysis experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2147443360,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic fungus surrounded by an elaborate polysaccharide capsule that is strictly required for its virulence in humans and other mammals. Nearly half of the sugar residues in the capsule are derived from UDP-glucuronic acid or its metabolites. To examine the role of these nucleotide sugars in C. neoformans, the gene encoding UDP-glucose dehydrogenase was disrupted. Mass spectrometry analysis of nucleotide sugar pools showed that the resulting mutant lacked both UDP-glucuronic acid and its downstream product, UDP-xylose, thus confirming the effect of the knockout and indicating that an alternate pathway for UDP-glucuronic acid production was not used. The mutant was dramatically affected by the lack of specific sugar donors, demonstrating altered cell integrity, temperature sensitivity, lack of growth in an animal model of cryptococcosis, and morphological defects. Additionally, the polysaccharide capsule could not be detected on the mutant cells, although the possibility remains that abbreviated forms of capsule components are made, possibly without proper surface display. The capsule defect is largely independent of the other observed changes, as cells that are acapsular because of mutations in other genes show lack of virulence but do not exhibit alterations in cell integrity, temperature sensitivity, or cellular morphology. All of the observed alterations were reversed by correction of the gene disruption.

To fully understand the biosynthesis of polysaccharides, it is necessary to investigate the upstream sources of their component sugars. In many cases the immediate donors are nucleotide sugars, the activated forms of monosaccharides that are the substrates of glycosyl transfer reactions. These compounds may be formed from appropriate monosaccharides or sugar phosphates or generated through interconversion of existing nucleotide sugars. An example of the latter case is the pathway centered on UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA). 1The abbreviations used are: GlcUA, glucuronic acid; Ugd1p, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase; DIC, differential interference contrast; GalXM, galactoxylomannan; GXM, glucuronoxylomannan; Uxs1p, UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; GC, gas chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: GlcUA, glucuronic acid; Ugd1p, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase; DIC, differential interference contrast; GalXM, galactoxylomannan; GXM, glucuronoxylomannan; Uxs1p, UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; GC, gas chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type. This compound is generated from UDP-glucose via the action of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Ugd1p) and depending on the cell type may be further converted to UDP-xylose, UDP-arabinose, UDP-galacturonic acid, or other compounds (reviewed in Ref. 1Seifert G.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The broad importance of UDP-GlcUA is readily apparent upon consideration of the downstream polymers that utilize this compound or its immediate descendents. For example, bacterial cells require the formation of UDP-aminoarabinose from UDP-GlcUA for lipid A modifications that occur in the setting of resistance to antimicrobial peptides (2Nummila K. Kilpelainen I. Zahringer U. Vaara M. Helander I.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Matrix polysaccharides in plants, which are constitutively synthesized to maintain cell wall integrity, may derive half of their mass from monosaccharides donated from UDP-GlcUA derivatives (3Zablackis E. Huang J. Muller B. Darvill A.G. Albersheim P. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In animals, synthesis of glycoproteins and proteoglycans is dependent on UDP-xylose and other compounds generated from UDP-GlcUA. Our interest in UDP-glucuronic acid arises from its importance in capsule synthesis in the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. This opportunistic pathogen causes severe disease in immunocompromised individuals, which is generally fatal if not treated. For virulence, this organism depends on an extensive polysaccharide capsule that surrounds its cell wall. One capsule component is termed galactoxylomannan (GalXM), a polymer in which about 20 mol % of the sugar residues are xylose (4Vaishnav V.V. Bacon B.E. O'Neill M.O. Cherniak R. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 306: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The majority of the capsule is composed of a second polymer termed glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), which consists of an α-1,3-linked mannose backbone modified with monomeric side chains of xylose and glucuronic acid. The xylose and glucuronic acid of GXM account for 40-60% of the total sugars in this polymer, depending on the serotype (5Cherniak R. Valafar H. Morris L.C. Valafar F. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 146-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heavy modification with glucuronic acid contributes to the highly acidic nature of GXM, and thus of the fungal cell surface. The xylose residues of GXM have been shown to be required for normal virulence of the cells (6Moyrand F. Klaproth B. Himmelreich U. Dromer F. Janbon G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Motivated by the requirement for capsule in cryptococcal pathogenesis, and by the importance of UDP-glucuronic acid in capsule synthesis, we wished to investigate the effects on cryptococcal biology and virulence of reducing the levels of this nucleotide sugar. To do this we deleted the fungal gene encoding UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. This protein has been the subject of intensive study, including its purification and cloning from multiple prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (reviewed in Ref. 7Campbell R.E. Mosimann S.C. van De Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Strynadka N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7012-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and analysis of its three-dimensional structure (7Campbell R.E. Mosimann S.C. van De Rijn I. Tanner M.E. Strynadka N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7012-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We previously examined the characteristics of the cryptococcal enzyme, establishing kinetic parameters for the wild type and several mutant forms (8Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Ory J.J. Doering T.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We also noted that the cryptococcal protein occurs as a dimer, similar to the case in bacteria (9Schiller J.G. Lamy F. Frazier R. Feingold D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 453: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) but unlike other eukaryotes that have been investigated (10Gainey P.A. Pestell T.C. Phelps C.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Franzen J.S. Ashcom J. Marchetti P. Cardamone J.J. Feingold D.S. Biochim. Biophys.

In this study we examine the effects of deleting the gene encoding Ugd1p on nucleotide sugar pools, capsule synthesis, cell growth, and fungal virulence. Strains and Cell Growth—The cas2 mutant strain NE146 and the uxs1 mutant strain NE178 were provided by Guilhem Janbon (Institute Pasteur); the cap59 mutant strain TYCC33 was from June Kwon-Chung (National Institutes of Health), and the wild type C. neoformans strain JEC21 (serotype D MAT α) was provided by Joe Heitman (Duke University). Cells in liquid culture were grown at 30 °C with continuous shaking in YP medium (1% BactoYeast Extract, 2% BactoPeptone) containing 2% dextrose or 2% myo-inositol as noted. For phenotypic analysis, cells were grown overnight, diluted to an A600 of 1, and allowed to grow for another hour. Cells were then further diluted to an A600 of 0.1, and 5-μl aliquots of this suspension and three 5-fold serial dilutions in deionized H2O were plated. Growth conditions tested included YPD, minimal medium, and YPD supplemented with 1 m sorbitol, 0.005% SDS, 1 m NaCl, 50 mm MES, pH 5.5, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, or 30 μg/ml Congo Red (Sigma). Growth was assessed at 25, 30, or 37 °C as noted in the text. UGD1 Disruption and Complementation—Gene disruption was carried out essentially as described previously (14Davidson R.C. Blankenship J.R. Kraus P.R. De Jesus Berrios M. Hull C.M. D'Souza C.A. Wang P. Heitman J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2607-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The disruption construct contained the entire UDP-glucose dehydrogenase gene (UGD1; GenBank™ accession number AF405548) with bp 840-1080 (including the region encoding a conserved cysteine that is required for activity (8Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Ory J.J. Doering T.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) replaced by the nourseothricin acetyltransferase coding sequence from Streptomyces noursei (nat1) to confer nourseothricin resistance (15McDade H.C. Cox G.M. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39: 151-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To make this construct, UGD1 was PCR-amplified from serotype D strain JEC43α genomic DNA using sense primer DH-21 (5′-TCGCTCGTTCTTCGGTCGCAGCTG-3′) and antisense primer DH-1 (5′-CAGAAAACTAGCACGAATGTTGGG-3′). The 2649-bp product was gel-purified and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The C-terminal 1424 bp of UGD1 were removed by digestion with EcoRV and cloned into plasmid GMC-200-MCS to form plasmid Nat/DH. (GMC-200-MCS is a modification of GMC-200 (provided by Gary Cox, Duke University Medical Center), which contains nat1 driven by a cryptococcal actin promoter that is preceded by a PmeI site. The nat1 is followed by a Trp terminator which ends in an EcoRV restriction site, and the PmeI and EcoRV sites are flanked by PvuII sites.) The N-terminal 898-bp fragment of UGD1 was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and modified with terminal PmeI restriction sites using sense primer DH-PmeI (5′-GGGTTTAAACCCCACCAAACGCTTACATCC-3′) and antisense primer DH-PmeI (5′-GGGTTTAAACCCCAAGTCGGCAGCGTAGCC-3′). The product was column purified (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) and cloned into the GMC Nat/DH plasmid at PmeI. The final construct (DH/Nat/DH) contained the UGD1 gene fragments in the same orientation as the nat1 gene. This was digested with PvuII to release the DH/Nat/DH fragment, which was gel-purified and used to biolistically transform JEC21 cells as in Refs. 16Toffaletti D.L. Rude T.H. Johnston S.A. Durack D.T. Perfect J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 17Davidson R.C. Cruz M.C. Sia R.A.L. Allen B. Alspaugh J.A. Heitman J. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2000; 29: 38-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar. The cells were allowed to recover on YPD medium for 24 h, replated onto YPD plates containing 100 μg/ml nourseothricin, and incubated at 30 °C for 7-10 days to allow colony growth. To assess gene replacement, genomic DNA prepared from individual transformants was screened by PCR, using standard conditions with the addition of 5% Me2SO (15McDade H.C. Cox G.M. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39: 151-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used, diagrammed in Fig. 1, panel A, are as follows: primer 1, 5′-CATGTCTCGTTTCTTCGTTCC-3′; primer 2, 5′-CCTTCTTGAAGGCCCAACCAAGAATCG-3′; primer 3, 5′-CCTATCCGATAAGGAAACCG-3′; primer 4, 5′-CAGTTCTGCAGGGCACGGTGG-3′; and primer 5, 5′-CCGCCGGTACGCGTGGATCGCCGG-3′. Several transformants were additionally tested by DNA blotting (below) to confirm gene replacement. To complement the disruption strain we used a DNA fragment containing a hygromycin resistance gene (HYG (18Cox G.M. Toffaletti D.L. Perfect J.R. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1996; 34: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) and the entire coding sequence of UGD1 along with 600 bp upstream as a putative promoter region. To make this fragment, UGD1 plus the upstream region was PCR-amplified from JEC21 genomic DNA such that NotI and AvrII sites were added to the 5′ end and a NotI site was added to the 3′ end, using sense primer DH CB-1 (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCCTAGGAACATTGCTCGTTGTTACTC-3′) and antisense primer DH CB-2 (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCGACTATCGCCTTAAATACG-3′). The product was gel-purified and cloned into the pTEL-HYG plasmid (from Gary Cox (18Cox G.M. Toffaletti D.L. Perfect J.R. J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 1996; 34: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) at the NotI site. The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI and AvrII to release a fragment containing both genes. This fragment was gel-purified and biolistically delivered into the ugd1 disruption strain. The cells were allowed to recover on YPD medium for 24 h, replated onto YPD plates containing 30 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Diagnostics), and incubated at 30 °C for 7-10 days to allow colony growth. Colonies were screened by PCR and blotting as above. DNA Blotting—Genomic DNA was isolated from wild type (JEC21), disruption strains, and corrected strains, digested overnight with XbaI, and probed with a 600-bp portion of UGD1 (downstream of the nat1 insertion site, hatched bar in Fig. 1, panel A) using standard methods (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2004: 2.9.1-2.9.11Google Scholar). The probe was generated by PCR amplification using primers DH-2 (5′-TCCTTGCCGAGGGTACCGCTATC-3′) and DH-3 (5′-CCTTCTTGAAGGCCCAACCAAGAATCG-3′), column-purified, and labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen). Isolation of Nucleotide Sugars—Nucleotide sugar pools from the various cryptococcal strains were isolated by ion-pair solid-phase extraction (20Rabina J. Maki M. Savilahti E.M. Jarvinen N. Penttila L. Renkonen R. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) of soluble fractions generated as described below under “Localization and Immunoblotting.” Aliquots of these fractions corresponding to 1 mg of protein were brought to 1 ml with 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate and applied to 3-ml Envi-Carb carbon columns (Supelco; Bellefonte, PA) that had been pre-washed with 3 ml of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid followed by 2 ml of water. To remove salts, detergents, and other unwanted solutes, the columns were sequentially washed with 2 ml of water, 2 ml of 25%(v/v) acetonitrile, and 2 ml of 50 mm TEAA buffer, pH 7 (Sigma). The nucleotide sugars were then eluted with 3 ml of 25%(v/v) acetonitrile in 50 mm TEAA buffer, pH 7. To remove the acetonitrile, samples were dried for 30 min under a stream of nitrogen, after which the aqueous remainder was lyophilized. The dried material was then sequentially redissolved in 1 ml of methanol, 0.5 ml of water, and 0.5 ml of methanol, with drying under nitrogen in between. The final dry samples were dissolved in 20 μl of water, and 0.2 μl of each was subjected to capillary HPLC-coupled mass spectrometry analysis. Capillary HPLC—Capillary HPLC coupled to mass analysis was performed as described previously (21Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14218-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with slight modifications, using an Agilent 1100 series capillary HPLC work station (Agilent) with Chemistation software for data acquisition, analysis, and management. HPLC separations were performed on a 0.3 × 250-mm C18 column (Zorbax 300 SB, 5 μm, Agilent) using a binary solvent system composed of 5% methanol (eluent A) and 90% methanol in water (eluent B), both containing 3.5 mm dibutylamine, with pH adjusted to 5.5 with 2 m acetic acid. After injection of 0.2 μl of sample, the elution profile was 0% eluent B for 7 min, 15% eluent B for 9 min, 40% eluent B for 11 min, and 100% eluent B for 23 min. The flow rate was 5 μl/min, and absorbances at 232, 260, and 280 nm were monitored during each run. After each run the column was washed with 90% eluent B for 15 min, and equilibrated with 100% eluent A for 40 min. The capillary HPLC was directly coupled to the mass spectrometer described below. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were acquired on a Mariner Bio-Spectrometry work station electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the negative ion mode as described previously (21Hwang H.Y. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14218-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Zhang L. Beeler D.L. Lawrence R. Lech M. Liu J. Davis J.C. Shriver Z. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42311-42321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nitrogen was used as a desolvation gas as well as a nebulizer. Conditions for electrospray ionization-MS were as follows: nebulizer flow 1 liter/min, nozzle temperature 140 °C, drying gas (N2) flow 0.1 liters/min, spray tip potential 2.8 kV, nozzle potential 70 V, and skimmer potential 9 V. Negative ion spectra were generated by scanning the range of m/z 150-1000. During analyses, the indicated vacuum was 2.1 × 10-6 torr. Total ion chromatograms and mass spectra were processed with the Data Explorer software version 3.0. Immunofluorescence—To image capsule, cells were labeled for 60 min at room temperature as described previously (23Pierini L.M. Doering T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with either anticapsular monoclonal antibody 2H1 (from Arturo Casadevall), which was tagged with Cy3, or with unlabeled monoclonal antibodies to GXM (from Tom Kozel, listed in Table II), followed by washing and a second incubation with Cy3 tagged anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were obtained using a LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany).Table IIMonoclonal antibody binding to wild type and mutant Cryptococcus strainsAntibodyRequires O-acetylationRequires xyloseWild typecas2uxs1ugd1cap591255NoNo+aUnless otherwise indicated (see notes below), + indicates uniform ring staining of the cell surface with the indicated antibody and − indicates no detectable staining.+bThe bright surface staining seen with antibody 1255 on cas2 cells had a consistently punctate character, unlike the smoother appearance of this antibody on wild type or uxs1 cells.+−cugd1 cells showed extremely faint staining of their surfaces with antibody 1255 in most experiments, a subtle but consistent difference from the acapsular strain cap59 (see “Discussion”).−339YesNo+−+−−1326YesNo+−+−−3C2NoYes++−−−F12D2NoYes++−−−a Unless otherwise indicated (see notes below), + indicates uniform ring staining of the cell surface with the indicated antibody and − indicates no detectable staining.b The bright surface staining seen with antibody 1255 on cas2 cells had a consistently punctate character, unlike the smoother appearance of this antibody on wild type or uxs1 cells.c ugd1 cells showed extremely faint staining of their surfaces with antibody 1255 in most experiments, a subtle but consistent difference from the acapsular strain cap59 (see “Discussion”). Open table in a new tab Transmission Electron Microscopy—For ultrastructural analysis, yeast cells were fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 2% glutaraldehyde (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Cells were washed in phosphate buffer and postfixed for 1 h in 1% osmium tetroxide (Polysciences Inc.) and then rinsed in phosphate buffer and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and propylene oxide prior to embedding in Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA). Sections of 70-90 nm were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed with a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL Inc., Peabody, MA). Compositional Analysis—Glycosyl residue composition was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of the per-O-trimethylsilyl methyl glycosides obtained by methanolysis of polysaccharide samples, essentially as described by Merkle and Poppe (24Merkle R.K. Poppe I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, methanolysis was performed by treatment of dried aliquots of polysaccharide with 1 n HCl in anhydrous methanol (1.0 ml, 80 °C, 16-22 h). Per-O-trimethylsilylation of the resultant monosaccharide methyl glycosides was carried out using Tri-Sil (Pierce; 200 ml, 80 °C, 30 min). Following careful evaporation of the Tri-Sil, the trimethylsilyl methyl glycosides were extracted into n-hexane for GC/MS analysis using a 30-m DB-5-bonded phase fused silica capillary column or equivalent (splitless injection; temperature program 140-260 °C at 4 °C/min). GC/MS analysis was performed using a Finnigan GCQ GC/IT-MS operating in electron ionization mode. Glycoside derivatives were identified by characteristic retention times and mass spectra compared, where necessary, to those of authentic standards; quantitation was based on total ion current traces. GXM Preparation—Isolation of GXM was essentially as described by Cherniak et al. (25Cherniak R. Morris L.C. Anderson B.C. Meyer S.A. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 59-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 30 °C with constant shaking for 5 days in capsule induction medium (35 mm MOPS, pH 7.1; 12 mm NaHCO3; 2% (w/v) dextrose; 1.5 g/liter asparagine; 1.7 g/liter Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco)). Cells were sedimented at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and any remaining cells were cleared from the supernatant fraction by filtration over a 0.22-μm membrane. The polysaccharide was precipitated overnight with 3 volumes of 95% ethanol, subjected to centrifugation as before, and washed sequentially with 95% ethanol, acetone, and ether. The pellet was air-dried at room temperature, weighed, and then dissolved in 0.2 m NaCl (10 mg/ml) at 4 °C overnight with constant stirring. For every mg of polysaccharide, 3 mg of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide was added. Additional hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide from a 0.05% solution was then slowly added until a precipitate appeared. The precipitate was spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature, dried, weighed, and dissolved in 25 ml of 1 m NaCl as before. GXM was then precipitated with 95% ethanol as above, dissolved in 1 m NaCl, and finally dialyzed against tap water for 2 days and distilled water for 3 days. The sample was filtered over a 0.22-μm membrane and lyophilized overnight. The typical yield from a 500-ml culture of wild type cells was 75 mg for wild type. Localization and Immunoblotting—For membrane preparations, JEC21 cells were grown in 50 ml of YPD at 30 °C overnight and then harvested by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed in 5 ml of cold lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA). The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 5 μg/ml antipain, trypsin inhibitor, and leupeptin; 1 μg/ml o-phenanthroline; 0.1 mm aminocaproic acid, and 1.6 μg/ml benzamidine). An equal volume of 0.5-mm glass beads (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) was then added to the suspension, which was vigorously vortex mixed for 2 min alternating with 1 min on ice until >80% breakage was observed under a light microscope. The lysate was removed, and the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Washes were pooled with the remainder of the lysate, and the pool was subjected to a clearing spin (1,100 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). 0.5 ml of the supernatant was removed (“total protein fraction”), and the remainder was subjected to high speed centrifugation (60,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C). The supernatant fraction was reserved (“soluble fraction”), and the membrane pellet was resuspended thoroughly in 1 ml of lysis buffer and spun again as before. The resulting crude washed membrane fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer. The soluble fraction was concentrated 8-fold using an Amicon Ultrafiltration device (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and all fractions were stored at 4 °C. Equal proportions of each fraction were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Standard methods were used for transfer and immunoblotting, using dilutions of 1:5,000 for both primary antiserum (anti-Ugd1p (8Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Ory J.J. Doering T.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or anti-PGK (from Randy Shekman)) and secondary antiserum (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase; Amersham Biosciences), and detection with Western Lighting Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Animal Studies—2.5 × 104 cells in 50 μl of deionized H2O were delivered intranasally into 4-6-week-old C57Bl/6 mice (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Groups of three and five mice were humanely sacrificed at 1 h and 7 days after inoculation, respectively. The lungs were harvested, homogenized in water, and plated for colony-forming units as described in Ref. 26Sommer U. Liu H. Doering T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47724-47730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar. To begin investigating the role of UDP-glucuronic acid in C. neoformans biology, we deleted the UGD1 gene that encodes UDP-glucose dehydrogenase. To do this, we generated a construct in which a 240-bp segment of the gene (including the sequence encoding a conserved cysteine required for activity (8Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Ory J.J. Doering T.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) was replaced by a drug resistance marker (nat1), but 0.9 kb of 5′ genomic sequence and 1.4 kb of 3′ genomic sequence flanking the deletion were maintained (Fig. 1, panel A). After biolistic transformation of this construct into serotype D strain JEC21, we screened drug-resistant transformants by PCR (Fig. 1, panel B). Two of 100 transformants tested had undergone the desired gene replacement. As shown for one of these, the disrupted strain no longer contains the deleted region of UGD1 but has gained nat1 sequence. We confirmed the gene disruption by DNA blotting (Fig. 1, panel C, and data not shown). We further subjected one disruptant to biolistic transformation with a DNA fragment containing the wild type gene adjacent to a second drug resistance marker (see “Experimental Procedures”); this resulted in correction of the deleted gene back to wild type (Fig. 1, panels B and C). To examine protein expression in the disruption and corrected strains, we used an antibody generated against bacterially expressed C. neoformans Ugd1p (8Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Ory J.J. Doering T.L. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, no protein was detected in the disruption strain, although it was present in the corrected version of that strain. This shows that, as expected, disruption of UGD1 resulted in absence of its protein product. To confirm that disruption of UGD1 indeed altered the levels of UDP-GlcUA, we analyzed the nucleotide sugars present in the wild type, ugd1 disruption, and corrected strains by mass spectrometry. We additionally tested a strain in which the gene encoding UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (UXS1 (27Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Doering T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12003-12008Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)) had been deleted (6Moyrand F. Klaproth B. Himmelreich U. Dromer F. Janbon G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These uxs1 mutant cells should produce UDP-GlcUA but will be unable to convert it to UDP-xylose. As shown in Fig. 3, panel A, and in Table I, both UDP-GlcUA (579.0611) and UDP-Xyl (535.0706) are detected in wild type cells. Cells lacking Uxs1p, as expected, produce UDP-GlcUA but no UDP-xylose (Fig. 3"
https://openalex.org/W2025573887,"The influence of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I structure on ABCA1-mediated efflux of cellular unesterified (free) cholesterol (FC) and phospholipid (PL) is not well understood. To address this issue, we used a series of apoA-I mutants to examine the contributions of various domains in the molecule to ABCA1-mediated FC and PL efflux from mouse J774 macrophages and human skin fibroblasts. Irrespective of the cell type, deletion or disruption of the C-terminal lipid-binding domain of apoA-I drastically reduced the FC and PL efflux (∼90%), indicating that the C-terminal amphipathic α-helix is required for high affinity microsolubilization of FC and PL. Deletion in the N-terminal region of apoA-I also reduced the lipid efflux (∼30%) and increased the Km about 2-fold compared with wild type apoA-I, whereas deletion of the central domain (Δ123–166) had no effect on either Km or Vmax. These results indicate that ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux is relatively insensitive to the organization of the apoA-I N-terminal helix-bundle domain. Alterations in apoA-I structure caused parallel changes in its ability to bind to a PL bilayer and to induce efflux of FC and PL. Overall, these results are consistent with a two-step model for ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux. In the first step, apoA-I binds to ABCA1 and hydrophobic α-helices in the C-terminal domain of apoA-I insert into the region of the perturbed PL bilayer created by the PL transport activity of ABCA1, thereby allowing the second step of lipidation of apoA-I and formation of nascent high density lipoprotein particles to occur.

Atherosclerosis. 1996; 121: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and studies in transgenic mice and rabbits have demonstrated that the expression of human apoA-I inhibits the development of atherosclerosis (2Schultz J.R. Rubin E.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Rader D.J. Am. J. Cardiol. 2003; 92: 42J-49JAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The protective action of apoA-I is due primarily to its role in reverse cholesterol transport (4Oram J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Yancey P.G. Bortnick A.E. Kellner-Weibel G. Llera-Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Reverse cholesterol transport comprises the following processes: 1) cholesterol efflux from cells in peripheral tissues including macrophages in the arterial wall, 2) lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase-mediated esterification of HDL-associated cholesterol, and 3) receptor-mediated delivery of this cholesterol ester to the liver for excretion from the body (6Marcel Y.L. Kiss R.S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Sviridov D. Nestel P. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 161: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The function of apoA-I in each of these steps is dependent upon its physical state at each stage. Regarding step 1, lipid-free (poor) apoA-I (8Rye K.A. Barter P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) appears to be the initial acceptor for cellular free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipids (PL) released by the activity of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (9Brewer Jr., H.B.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1322-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Mutations in the ABCA1 gene lead to Tangier disease and Familial HDL deficiency and these patients are characterized by sterol deposition in macrophages and increased atherosclerosis (4Oram J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5Yancey P.G. Bortnick A.E. Kellner-Weibel G. Llera-Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). A direct correlation between the expression of ABCA1 and apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux has been revealed, emphasizing the importance of this transporter in the formation of HDL (9Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. Am. J. Cardiol. 2003; 91: 3E-11EAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10Singaraja R.R. Brunham L.R. Visscher H. Kastelein J.J. Hayden M.R.

Biol. 2003; 23: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, the role of the structure of apoA-I in facilitating the export of cellular FC and PL via ABCA1 is not well established. The human apoA-I molecule is a single polypeptide chain with 243 amino acid residues consisting of a series of homologous 11- and 22-mer amino acid repeats that are often interposed with proline-containing segments. The 22-mer repeats form amphipathic α-helices (6Marcel Y.L. Kiss R.S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Lund-Katz S. Liu L. Thuahnai S.T.

Acta. 2001; 1531: 4-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and investigations of the secondary structure of apoA-I identified helical segments 44–65 and 220–241 in the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively, as being particularly hydrophobic and having the highest lipid binding affinities (14Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of apoA-I consists of two domains: a helix bundle domain comprising the N-terminal and central α-helices (residues 1–186) and a strongly lipid-binding C-terminal domain (residues 187–243) (15Saito H.

An apoA-I molecule is thought to associate initially with the surface of a membrane via the latter domain, after which the helical bundle opens enhancing lipid-protein interaction (15Saito H.

When apoA-I molecules interact with a cell expressing ABCA1, low levels of cellular FC and PL are removed and used to create various HDL particles (16Liu L. Bortnick A.E. Nickel M. Dhanasekaran P.

The fact that peptides corresponding to the hydrophobic α-helical regions of the apoA-I molecule can also mediate membrane microsolubilization (20Mendez A.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P.

Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implies that apoA-I/lipid interactions play a critical role. The ability of apoA-I to bind lipids is likely to be important in both the acquisition of PL and FC via ABCA1 and in the retention of these lipids to form stable HDL particles. Importantly, hydrophobic interactions between apoA-I and ABCA1 are also likely to be significant in the overall process of PL and FC efflux (24Chroni A. Liu T. Fitzgerald M.L. Freeman M.W. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2126-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Chroni A. Mendez A.J. Zannis V.I. Freeman M.W. J.

Several laboratories have used engineered apoA-I variants to examine the contributions of different regions of the apoA-I molecule to membrane microsolubilization (17Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14524-14533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the C-terminal region of apoA-I is essential for optimal ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux although there may be cell-specific effects because C-terminal truncation of apoA-I has been reported to significantly reduce lipid efflux from macrophages, but not from fibroblasts (27Burgess J.W. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Liang P. McManus D.C. Desforges M. Rassart E. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14524-14533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to this uncertainty about the quantitative contribution of the apoA-I C-terminal domain, there is disagreement about the role of the helix bundle domain. Thus, on the one hand, deletion of central α-helices has been reported to have no effect on lipid efflux from macrophages (28McManus D.C. Scott B.R. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Schultz J.R. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5043-5051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) but, on the other hand, it has been claimed that central α-helices are essential for ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux in the same cell type (26Chroni A.

Despite the presence of a strongly lipid-binding α-helix in the N-terminal region of the apoA-I molecule, deletion of the N-terminal domain has been asserted to have a minimal effect on ABCA1-mediated FC and PL efflux from macrophages (26Chroni A.

It is apparent that the use of apoA-I variants has not yet explained how the apoA-I domain structure influences ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux from cells. An important limitation of prior studies using engineered apoA-I molecules in assays of ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux is that they were conducted with saturating concentrations of apoA-I in the extracellular medium. Under this condition, the effects of alterations in apoA-I structure tend to be minimized so that the contributions of the various apoA-I domains to lipid efflux become difficult to detect and quantitate. In the current study, we have addressed some of these limitations by exploring the roles of the apoA-I helix bundle and C-terminal domains in ABCA1-mediated FC and PL efflux using more than one cell type and engineered apoA-I molecules at a range of concentrations. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of apoA-I play a significant role in eliciting lipid efflux from either macrophages or fibroblasts. Analysis of the efflux kinetics provides insights into the likely contributions of apoA-I/ABCA1 and apoA-I/PL interactions to the overall microsolubilization process. Fetal bovine serum, gentamicin, 8-(4-chlorophenythio)-cAMP, 9-cis-retinoic acid, and 22-hydroxycholesterol were purchased from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin was obtained from Intergen (Purchase, NY). [1,2-3H]Cholesterol (51 Ci/mmol), and [methyl-3H]choline chloride (86 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Minimum essential medium (MEM) buffered with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (MEM-Hepes), was obtained from BioWhitaker (Walkersville, MD). RPMI 1640, Eagle's modified MEM, and phosphate-buffered saline were purchased from CellGro (Herndon, VA). The acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor, Pfizer CP-113,818, was a gift from Pfizer Inc. (Groton, CT). Preparation of ApoA-I—HDL was isolated from fresh plasma of normolipidemic donors by sequential ultracentrifugation as described earlier (30Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1562-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Human HDL was delipidated in ethanol/diethyl ether (31Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and apoA-I was isolated by anion exchange chromatography (32Weisweiler P. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1987; 169: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Prior to use, the purified protein stored in lyophilized form at –20 °C was resolubilized in guanidine hydrochloride (6 m) and dialyzed extensively against Tris buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). The protein concentration was determined by measuring its absorbance at 280 nm; the mass extinction coefficient (ml/(mg·cm)) of apoA-I was 1.13. Expression and Purification of ApoA-1 Mutants—The construction of plasmids for expressing wild type (WT) apoA-I and its mutants, and the isolation and purification of these proteins have been described previously (15Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23227-23232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The following deletion mutants were used in this study: Δ1–43, Δ44–65, Δ44–126, Δ123–166, Δ190–243, and Δ223–243. The point mutants, L230P and L230P,L233P,Y236P were constructed, expressed, and purified similarly. Briefly, the cDNA for either WT or apoA-I mutant was ligated into a thioredoxin (Trx) fusion expression vector pET32a(+) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). These transformed cells were cultured in LB medium at 37 °C and expression of the fusion protein Trx-apoA-I was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. After sonicating the bacterial pellet, the lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-chelating, histidine-binding resin column (Novagen). The Trx-apoA-I fusion protein bound to the column was eluted, pooled, and dialyzed against 20 mm NH4HCO3. Subsequently, the fusion protein was complexed with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (to prevent nonspecific cleavage), and then cleaved with thrombin to release the Trx. The mixture was then lyophilized, delipidated, and dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride solution. Trx was separated from apoA-I by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column. Further purification (>95%) of the proteins was done by gel filtration with Superdex 75 and/or anion exchange chromatography with Q-Sepharose. Preparation of ApoA-I Peptides—Peptides representing different segments of apoA-I were synthesized as described in detail previously (33Anantharamaiah G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 627-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and their solutions were prepared by dissolving known amounts of peptides in Tris buffer. Preparation of Cell Monolayers—J774 murine macrophages were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% gentamycin, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber (95% air, 5% CO2). For efflux experiments, these cells were then seeded in 12-well plates and grown to 80–90% confluence. They were then labeled with either 3 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol or 5 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride as described previously (16Liu L. Bortnick A.E. Nickel M. Dhanasekaran P. Subbaiah P.V. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42976-42984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cholesterol-enriched monolayers were prepared by incubating the cells for 24 h in RPMI medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, 2 μg/ml CP-113,818 ACAT inhibitor, 3 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol or 5 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride, and 25 μg/ml acetyl-low density lipoprotein. For double labeling, the cells were incubated with 20 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride and 3 μCi/ml [14C]cholesterol for 48 h. After labeling, the cells were washed with MEM-Hepes and incubated with RPMI medium containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml CP-113,818 ACAT inhibitor, and 0.3 mm 8-(4-chlorophenythio)-cAMP for 12 h, to up-regulate the expression of ABCA1 (34Bortnick A.E.

Human skin fibroblasts (GM 3468A) were maintained in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% gentamycin and incubated at 37 °C. For the efflux experiments, the fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates and grown to confluence and then labeled with 3 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol or 5 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride as described before (17Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Weisgraber K.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2021-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cholesterol-enriched cells were prepared by incubating the radiolabeled fibroblasts with an FC loading medium containing cholesterol/phospholipid liposomes for an additional 24 h (17Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Weisgraber K.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2021-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). After labeling the cells for either 24 (cholesterol efflux) or 48 h (phospholipid efflux), the cells were washed with MEM-Hepes and incubated for 12 h in Eagle's MEM containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml CP-113,818 ACAT inhibitor and 22-hydroxycholesterol (5 μg/ml), and 9-cis-retinoic acid (10 μm) to up-regulate ABCA1 (35Favari E. Bernini F. Tarugi P. Franceschini G. Calabresi L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The concentration of the protein in each well was determined by a modification of the Lowry method (36Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5332) Google Scholar). To determine the degree of radiolabeling of the cells at time zero (t = 0), appropriate wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dried, and the lipids were extracted with isopropyl alcohol. The radioactivity of the extracted lipids was measured by liquid scintillation counting (16Liu L. Bortnick A.E. Nickel M. Dhanasekaran P. Subbaiah P.V. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42976-42984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These extracted lipids were analyzed for FC by gas-liquid chromatography and for choline-containing PL by an enzymatic assay (Wako Bioproducts, Richmond, VA). The total FC and choline-PL contents of the fibroblasts at t = 0 were 20–30 and 50–70 μg/mg cell protein, respectively. The equivalent values for FC-enriched fibroblasts were 40–60 μg of FC/mg of protein and 120–140 μg of choline-PL/mg of protein (19Gillotte-Taylor K. Nickel M. Johnson W.J. Francone O.L. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11811-11820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Typical values for J774 cells were 5–15 μg of FC/mg of protein and 40–60 μgof choline-PL/mg of protein. For FC-enriched J774 macrophages, the equivalent values were 30–40 and 90–110 μg/mg of protein, respectively. Efflux of Cellular Cholesterol and Phospholipid—Cells prepared as described above were washed with MEM-Hepes and incubated with or without WT or mutant apoA-I under the indicated conditions of concentration and time. To determine the FC efflux, aliquots were removed from the incubation medium at specific time points, filtered, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For PL efflux, radioactivity was measured after extraction of the lipids from aliquots of the filtered incubation medium by the procedure of Bligh and Dyer (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The percent of FC and PL efflux were calculated after subtracting the background FC/PL efflux (without apoA-I) as follows: (counts/min in medium at 4 h/cpm in cells at t = 0) × 100. Km and Vmax values were calculated by fitting the curves obtained by plotting the fractional lipid efflux values obtained at 4 h and different concentrations of apoA-I to the Michaelis-Menten equation. mRNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from unlabeled fibroblasts and J774 macrophages treated as described above using the TRIzol reagent. The extracted RNA was precipitated by isopropyl alcohol and its integrity was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. 20 μg of RNA was separated in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes and cross-linked by UV irradiation. 324-bp probes extending from residues 711 to 1034 for human ABCA1 and 971 to 1294 for mouse ABCA1 were used to measure expression. The probes were 32P-radiolabeled using the random priming kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), hybridized overnight, and the bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Storm, Amersham Biosciences). The blot was stripped and quantified with an actin probe so that the level of ABCA1 mRNA could be normalized to that of actin. ABCA1-mediated Cholesterol and Phospholipid Efflux from J774 Cells—In the current study, J774 macrophages and human fibroblasts have been used as models to examine the role of apoA-I in ABCA1-mediated efflux studies. J774 cells and fibroblasts were treated with cAMP and 9-cis-retinoic acid plus 22-hydroxycholesterol, respectively, for ABCA1 induction. An ∼6-fold increase in ABCA1 expression was obtained with this induction (data not shown). All efflux experiments were performed with cells where ABCA1 was up-regulated in this fashion: induction of ABCA1 increased cholesterol efflux ∼7-fold in both J774 cells (from 1.9 ± 0.4 to 14.3 ± 0.2%/6 h) and fibroblasts (from 1.7 ± 0.1 to 12.4 ± 0.6%/6 h) with 20 μg/ml apoA-I in the extracellular medium. To better understand the influence of the different domains in the apoA-I molecule on the efficacy of the lipid efflux process, deletion mutants lacking domains along the apoA-I molecule were incubated with the cells. We have shown previously that the rate of FC and PL release from J774 cells and fibroblasts is maximal at concentrations of apoA-I ≥10 μg/ml (16Liu L. Bortnick A.E. Nickel M. Dhanasekaran P.

Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Weisgraber K.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2021-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, initially WT apoA-I and the various deletion mutants were incubated with J774 macrophages at a saturating concentration of 20 μg/ml and the efflux of PL and FC was monitored. Efflux to recombinant (WT) and human plasma apoA-I was similar (data not shown) and hence, WT apoA-I was used for all the comparisons in the study. The relative FC and PL efflux (normalized to the values for WT apoA-I) from ABCA1-stimulated J774 cells exposed to 20 μg/ml of either WT or mutant apoA-I are depicted in Fig. 1, A and B. In the case of WT apoA-I, approximately equal masses of cellular PL and FC were released in a 4-h incubation; this corresponds to a 2:1 FC/PL molar ratio. It is apparent that deletion of the central domains (residues 44–126 and 123–166) did not influence FC or PL efflux. These results agree with an earlier investigation in which it was shown that the elimination of the central domain of apoA-I had a minimal effect on ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux from THP-1 macrophages (27Burgess J.W. Frank P.G. Franklin V. Liang P. McManus D.C. Desforges M. Rassart E. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14524-14533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal hydrophobic α-helix (residues 44–65) and the N-terminal region (residues 1–43) led to a slight reduction in FC efflux relative to WT apoA-I (Fig. 1A). In contrast, removal of the C-terminal domain reduced FC efflux by ∼50% under the same experimental conditions where excess apolipoprotein was present in the extracelluar medium (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, the effects of removing either residues 190–243 or 223–243 had either no or an insignificant effect on PL efflux (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the results shown in Fig. 1 for 20 μg/ml apoA-I, exposure of the cells to 2 μg/ml apoA-I (approximately the Km value) revealed dramatic differences between lipid efflux to WT apoA-I and the deletion mutants (Fig. 2, A and B). Under this condition, truncation of the C-terminal domain clearly affected the ability of apoA-I to stimulate FC efflux. Deletion of this region (Δ190–243 and Δ223–243) resulted in an 80–90% reduction in both FC and PL efflux from these cells. Furthermore, at this low concentration of apoA-I, significant reduction in FC and PL efflux (20–30%) occurred with N-terminal (Δ1–43) deletion or removal of residues 44–65. However, removal of the central domain of apoA-I (Δ44–126 and Δ123–166) did not affect the lipid efflux at this low concentration of apoA-I. The ability of apoA-I variants lacking the central domain to stimulate FC and PL efflux similarly to WT at both concentrations (2 and 20 μg/ml) indicates that this domain is not critical for lipid efflux.Fig. 2Relative cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from J774 macrophages to 2 μg/ml of WT and deletion mutants of apo-AI.

https://openalex.org/W2124127967,"The effects of four natural tocopherols on the proliferation and signaling pathways were examined in the human mastocytoma cell line (HMC-1). The four tocopherols inhibited HMC-1 cell proliferation with different potency (δ > α = γ > β). Growth inhibition correlated with the reduction of PKB (protein kinase B) phosphorylation by the different tocopherols. The reduction of PKB phosphorylation led to a decrease of its activity, as judged from a parallel reduction of GSKα/β phosphorylation. The translocation of PKB to the membrane, as a response to receptor stimulation by NGFβ, is also prevented by treatment with tocopherols. In the presence of PKC or PP2A inhibitors, the reduction of PKB phosphorylation by tocopherols was still observed, thus excluding the direct involvement of these enzymes. Other pathways, such as the Ras-stimulated ERK1/2 (extracellular signal responsive kinase) pathway, were not affected by tocopherol treatment. The tocopherols did not significantly change oxidative stress in HMC-1 cells, suggesting that the observed effects are not the result of a general reduction of oxidative stress. Thus, the tocopherols interfere with PKB phosphorylation and reduce proliferation of HMC-1 cells, possibly by modulating either phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, a kinase phosphorylating PKB (PDK1/2), or a phosphatase that dephosphorylates it. Inhibition of proliferation and PKB signaling in HMC-1 cells by vitamin E suggests a role in preventing diseases with mast cell involvement, such as allergies, atherosclerosis, and tumorigenesis.

Inhibition of proliferation and PKB signaling in HMC-1 cells by vitamin E suggests a role in preventing diseases with mast cell involvement, such as allergies, atherosclerosis, and tumorigenesis. The term vitamin E covers a group of eight lipid-soluble compounds, the four tocopherols and the four tocotrienols. α-Tocopherol is considered to be the most biologically active form, because it is specifically retained in the body by the liver through a specific transfer protein, the α-tocopherol transfer protein (α-TTP) (1Arita M. Sato Y. Miyata A. Tanabe T. Takahashi E. Kayden H.J. Arai H. Inoue K. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Tocopherols are considered as the main cellular, lipid-soluble, antioxidants with potential beneficial effects, such as protection against atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Tocopherols influence the activity of several enzymes and modulate the transcription of certain genes (2Zingg J.M. Azzi A. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1113-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Whereas some of the cellular effects may be the result of free radical scavenging, many effects of tocopherol are unrelated to its antioxidant properties. Protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; DPI, diphenylene iodonium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GSK, glycogen synthase kinase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NGFβ, nerve growth factor β; OA, okadaic acid; PKB, protein kinase B; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SCF, stem cell factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. has been recognized as the main cellular target of α-tocopherol (3Boscoboinik D. Chatelain E. Bartoli G.M. Azzi A. Exs. 1992; 62: 164-177PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation correlated with inhibition of PKC (4Tasinato A. Boscoboinik D. Bartoli G.M. Maroni P. Azzi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12190-12194Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The activity of PKC was not influenced directly, but through modulation of its phosphorylation status by activation of PP2A (5Ricciarelli R. Tasinato A. Clement S. Ozer N.K. Boscoboinik D. Azzi A. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recently, the activation of diacylglycerol kinase by tocopherol was also shown to influence PKC activity (6McNally A.K. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, certain cellular effects of the tocopherols were described that seemed to be PKC independent, such as the modulation of expression of certain genes (2Zingg J.M. Azzi A. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1113-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 7Azzi A. Aratri E. Boscoboinik D. Clement S. Ozer N.K. Ricciarelli R. Spycher S. Biofactors. 1998; 7: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). HMC-1 is a mastocytoma cell line with a gain of function mutation in the c-kit receptor (stem cell factor (SCF) receptor), which leads to constitutive tyrosine kinase activity independent of the c-kit ligand, SCF (8Furitsu T. Tsujimura T. Tono T. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Koshimizu U. Sugahara H. Butterfield J.H. Ashman L.K. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kitamura Y. Kanakura Y. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 1736-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The c-kit receptor is present in the majority of hematopoietic cells, playing indispensable functions in their proliferation and differentiation (9Galli S.J. Hammel I. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1994; 1: 33-39PubMed Google Scholar, 10Huizinga J.D. Thuneberg L. Kluppel M. Malysz J. Mikkelsen H.B. Bernstein A. Nature. 1995; 373: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Mutations of c-kit are found not only in mastocytoma and leukemia, but also in other cancers, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors or small cell lung carcinoma (11Rossi G. Cavazza A. Marchioni A. Migaldi M. Bavieri M. Facciolongo N. Petruzzelli S. Longo L. Tamberi S. Crino L. Mod. Pathol. 2003; 16: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Sattler M. Salgia R. Leuk. Res. 2004; 28: S11-S20Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The activity of the c-kit receptor can be completely inhibited by STI571/Gleevec®, an inhibitor designed against constitutively active Abelson kinase used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (13Heinrich M.C. Griffith D.J. Druker B.J. Wait C.L. Ott K.A. Zigler A.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 925-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As for most of the receptors with tyrosine kinase activity, stimulation of c-kit leads to the activation of several signaling pathways, including the Ras-MAPK-ERK and the PI3K-PKB pathways (8Furitsu T. Tsujimura T. Tono T. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Koshimizu U. Sugahara H. Butterfield J.H. Ashman L.K. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kitamura Y. Kanakura Y. J. Clin.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6850-6853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A growing amount of data supports the importance of PI3K-PKB signaling in many processes, including proliferation of cancer cells, cellular migration, apoptosis, and secretion (15Hill M.M. Hemmings B.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). PKB or Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, is a key enzyme in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-activated pathways. PKB has a wide range of cellular targets, and its increased activity can be found in many tumors. Activation of PKB involves a membrane translocation step, followed by phosphorylation of two key regulatory sites, Ser473 and Thr308. The pleckstrin homology domain (PH), present in the PKB molecule, binds phosphatidylinositol triphosphate, produced by activated PI3K at the plasma membrane. By the same mechanisms PDK-1, a kinase phosphorylating Thr308 in PKB, becomes active. Phosphorylation of Thr308 leads, however, only to partial activation of PKB. Only after phosphorylation at the second site (Ser473) by a yet unidentified kinase, does the enzyme become fully active (16Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 17Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Birnbaum M.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 444-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Once active, PKB can be inactivated by protein phosphatase PP2A or by PTEN, a lipid phosphatase, which hydrolyzes the products of PI3K (18Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Because of the correlation between enhanced activity of PI3K, PKB, and tumor progression, these enzymes became attractive targets for pharmacological intervention by specific inhibitors. Interestingly, several natural compounds, such as certain flavonoids, caffeine, and theophylline, were shown to be potent inhibitors of PI3K activity (19Spencer J.P. Rice-Evans C. Williams R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34783-34793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 20Foukas L.C. Daniele N. Ktori C. Anderson K.E. Jensen J. Shepherd P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37124-37130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The effects of tocopherols on these enzymes are as yet unclear. Mast cells have been implicated in two contrasting types of immune responses, the immediate hypersensitivity reactions associated with allergic phenomena and their acute activation by bacterial products during infection (21Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). Besides their well known central involvement in anaphylaxis, they contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial cystitis, scleroderma, and Crohn's disease. Increased numbers of mast cells were found also in atherosclerotic lesions, in particular in fatty streaks and the shoulder regions of atheromas (22Kaartinen M. Penttila A. Kovanen P.T. Circulation. 1994; 90: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Activated mast cells contribute to foam cell and fatty streak formation by stimulating low-density lipoprotein modification and uptake by macrophages (23Kovanen P.T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In some of these diseases it can be assumed that mast cell signaling and proliferation are deregulated, and normalization could play a beneficial role. In a model for canine atopic dermatitis, vitamin E inhibited histamine, prostaglandin D2, and chymase release both in unstimulated and mastoparan-stimulated canine mastocytoma cells (C2), but the signaling pathways involved have not been resolved in detail (24Gueck T. Aschenbach J.R. Fuhrmann H. Vet. Dermatol. 2002; 13: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We chose HMC-1 cells for the study of the effects of different tocopherols on mast cell proliferation and signaling. HMC-1 tumorigenicity is the result of an activated c-kit receptor, which is located at the beginning of a signaling cascade. Specific inhibition of c-kit by STI571 allows assessing and excluding the effect of tocopherols on other signaling cascades involved in mast cell proliferation. Materials—The antibodies (PKB, phospho-PKB/Ser473, phospho-PKB/Thr308, phospho-GSK3-α/β, phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The inhibitors wortmannin and okadaic acid (OA) were purchased from Sigma, and stored as stock solutions in ethanol, for OA at 50 mm, for wortmannin at 2 mm. For cell treatment, OA was used at a concentration of 50 nm and wortmannin at 0.5 or 1 μm. PKC412 was kindly obtained from B. Willi (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland), diluted in Me2SO (stock solution 10 mm) and used at concentrations between 250 and 1000 nm. STI571 (Gleevec®) was provided by E. Buchdunger (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland), diluted in Me2SO (stock solution 10 μm) and used at concentrations between 50 nm and 1 μm. Tocopherols were provided by Cognis (LaGrange, IL) and prepared as 50 mm stocks in ethanol. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), probucol, NGFβ, and LPA were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Treatment—HMC-1 cells (a human mastocytoma cell line) were grown in Iscove's media supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mm glutamine. U937 (myeloid leukemia cells) and A549 (lung carcinoma) cells (both from ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. MCF-7 cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and Saos-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% FCS. Before the treatment with the indicated tocopherol concentrations, cells were split, grown overnight in medium with 10% FCS, and then either starved in medium without FCS or grown further in medium with 10% FCS for the following 24 h. Cell Growth and Proliferation—Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density 1 × 105 cell/ml and grown for 24 h. Next day the medium was changed as indicated (with 10% FCS or without FCS) and treatment with different tocopherols was performed. Tocopherols were used at final concentration of 50 μm. The final concentration of the ethanol solvent in medium was 0.1%. Cells were counted using the hemocytometer with trypan blue exclusion. Statistical analyses were done using the Student's t test (unpaired 2-tailed). Apoptosis Assay—2 × 106 HMC-1 cells were treated with 0.1% ethanol (control) or the tocopherols (50 μm) for 48 h, harvested by trypsinization, and washed with PBS. Apoptotic DNA laddering was assayed using the apoptotic DNA laddering kit as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Measurements of Oxidative Stress—To detect oxidative stress in living cells 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes) was diluted in Me2SO prior to cell treatment. HMC-1 cells were treated with the tocopherols (50 μm) for 24 h, with or without co-treatment with H2O2, and then incubated with 4 μm CM-H2DCFDA (0.43 mm stock solution) for 90 min. Cells were washed with cold PBS, trypsinized, washed with PBS once again, fixed with 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, and then examined by fluorescent-activated cell sorting. Protein Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts and Western blots for PKB were done according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling Technology). Proteins were visualized using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylation of GSK-3α/β and ERK1/2 were analyzed the same way. Results were scanned by a Lumiimager (Roche Applied Science), and the intensity of the bands was quantified. β-Actin was stained to ensure equal loading. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). Isolation of Membrane Fractions—Isolation of membranes and supernatants was performed according to Ludowyke et al. (25Ludowyke R.I. Holst J. Mudge L.M. Sim A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6144-6152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown and treated in 10-cm dishes. After washing with cold PBS, cells were scraped in 0.6 ml of isolation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, TABS protease inhibitors mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated three times for 20 s using a Branson sonicator (power 2, 20% duty cycle), directly in ultracentrifugation tubes. Suspensions were centrifuged 25 min at 120,000 × g at 4 °C, supernatants were saved, pellets washed with 1 ml of isolation buffer, and centrifuged again. Membrane fractions were resuspended in isolation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, centrifuged, and soluble parts were used for protein concentration measurement and Western blot analysis. For treatment with growth factors, cells were pretreated either with solvent control (0.1% ethanol), α- or δ-tocopherol in 0% FCS medium for 24 h, washed twice with serum-free medium, and stimulated with human recombinant NGFβ (Sigma) (50 ng/ml) or LPA (20 μm) for the indicated time. Inhibitory Effects of Tocopherols on the Proliferation of HMC-1 Cells—Tocopherols and tocotrienols are able to inhibit proliferation or induce apoptotic cell death in various cell lines; mast cells have so far not been tested (26Ricciarelli R. Zingg J.M. Azzi A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2314-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To this end the inhibitory effect of tocopherols on proliferation of the human mastocytoma cell line HMC-1 was analyzed. Proliferation of mast cells is critically dependent on SCF acting through the receptor SCFR/c-kit; however, the cell line HMC-1 contains point mutations in the c-kit receptor (Val560 → Gly, Asp816 → Val), that keeps the receptor permanently active, independent of its ligand (8Furitsu T. Tsujimura T. Tono T. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Koshimizu U. Sugahara H. Butterfield J.H. Ashman L.K. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kitamura Y. Kanakura Y. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 1736-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 27Kanakura Y. Furitsu T. Tsujimura T. Butterfield J.H. Ashman L.K. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kitamura Y. Leukemia. 1994; 8: S18-S22PubMed Google Scholar). Two conditions were used for the growth inhibition assay: the presence of 10% FCS, thus providing growth factors, and in the absence of FCS, without any external growth factors. Cells were treated with different tocopherols for 24 or 48 h, and cell proliferation was quantified using a hemocytometer with trypan blue exclusion. Tocopherols were used at a concentration of 50 μm, which at least for α-tocopherol represents a physiological plasma concentration that can be reached by supplementation. After 24 h of incubation, α-tocopherol significantly inhibited growth of HMC-1 cells in the presence of serum. Under conditions without serum only slight growth of untreated cells was observed, and α-tocopherol could inhibit growth completely after the first 24 h (Fig. 1, A and B). β-Tocopherol was less potent in inhibition of cell proliferation, whereas γ-tocopherol displayed a similar effect to α-tocopherol (data not shown). For treatments with δ-tocopherol, maximal inhibition did not occur within the first 24 h of treatment; however cells stopped growing and detached at the later time points (48 or 72 h). At these times, δ-tocopherol was more potent than α-tocopherol, either with or without serum. This inhibitory effect of δ-tocopherol occurred also at lower (10-25 μm) concentrations (not shown), but was not observed in other cell lines such as liver hepatoma HepG2 or lung carcinoma A549 (not shown). The stronger growth inhibition by δ-tocopherol at later time points was at least in part the result of the induction of cell death in HMC-1 cells (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results suggest that the maximal growth inhibition by δ-tocopherol occurs only at later time points, but then more efficiently than other tocopherols (Fig. 1). Effect of α-Tocopherol Treatment on PKB Phosphorylation—A generally accepted model for the non-antioxidant molecular mechanism of α-tocopherol action is through inhibition of PKCα activity that can be directly connected with the inhibition of cell growth. However, the PI3K pathway also plays an important role in cell proliferation in many cell types through activation of the PDK1/2-PKB-GSKα/β pathway. In the case of mast cells that are critically dependent on the c-kit receptor, PI3K activity, especially its catalytic isoform p110α and regulatory subunit p85, was shown to be necessary for cell growth and survival (8Furitsu T. Tsujimura T. Tono T. Ikeda H. Kitayama H. Koshimizu U. Sugahara H. Butterfield J.H. Ashman L.K. Kanayama Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kitamura Y. Kanakura Y. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 1736-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 28Fukao T. Yamada T. Tanabe M. Terauchi Y. Ota T. Takayama T. Asano T. Takeuchi T. Kadowaki T. Hata Ji J. Koyasu S. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Experiments shown in the following were designed to verify whether this pathway is involved in growth inhibition by tocopherols in the HMC-1 cell line. We chose to analyze phosphorylation of PKB as marker for PI3K activation. PKB is phosphorylated at Ser473 by a yet unidentified kinase and at Thr307 by PDK1 (29Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1251-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cells were grown and treated with 50 μm α-tocopherol either in medium containing 10% FCS or in medium without FCS for the indicated times and phosphorylation of PKB was analyzed by Western blotting. In both cases, a clear decrease in the phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 after treatment with tocopherols was found (Fig. 2, A and B). In the presence of FCS, ethanol (at a final concentration of 0.1%), as a solvent for tocopherol, caused partial inhibition of PKB phosphorylation, although the effect of α-tocopherol, especially at the later time points, was stronger (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation at Thr307 was also inhibited, but to a lesser extent than Ser473 (data not shown). It was of interest to determine whether the inhibition of PKB by α-tocopherol was sufficient to decrease its in vivo activity. GSK-3 is one of the direct targets of PKB; the activity of PKB can thus be measured by assaying GSK-3 phosphorylation (31van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment with α-tocopherol leads to a decrease in phosphorylation of both GSK-3 isoforms (GSK-3α is phosphorylated at Ser9, GSK-3β at Ser21), in parallel with the decrease in PKB phosphorylation. It appears that GSK-3β (lower band, Fig. 2, A and B) is more sensitive to α-tocopherol treatment than the GSK-3α isoform (upper band). To assess whether the four tocopherols affect PKB phosphorylation with different potency, HMC-1 cells were incubated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of tocopherols in the presence of 10% FCS. All four tocopherols reduced PKB phosphorylation in HMC-1 cells, albeit with different efficiency (Fig. 2C). The antioxidant probucol (70 μm) was less efficient in reducing PKB phosphorylation (–27% ± 22) when compared with the tocopherols (50 μm) (Fig. 2C). At low concentrations, δ-tocopherol showed weaker inhibition of PKB phosphorylation, which correlated with less potent growth inhibition for early time points (Fig. 1, A and B). Inhibition of PKB Ser473 phosphorylation by the four tocopherols (50 μm) was also observed in other cell lines. MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Fig. 2D) showed a generally stronger reduction when compared with U937 myeloid leukemia cells (Fig. 2E) and Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 2F). The low response of Saos-2 cells correlates with the previously described absence of inhibition by tocopherols in this cell line (32Gysin R. Azzi A. Visarius T. Faseb J. 2002; 16: 1952-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 33Boscoboinik D. Szewczyk A. Hensey C. Azzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6188-6194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of PKB phosphorylation by tocopherols appears to be a general phenomenon, although the amount of reduction is dependent on the cell type and tocopherol analogue. Inhibition of PKB Phosphorylation by α-Tocopherol Leads to Inhibition of GSK-3 Phosphorylation—We decided to assess the detailed mechanisms involved in inhibition of PKB phosphorylation mainly with α-tocopherol, since it is the only one which can reach plasma levels of 50 μm after supplementation and therefore reflects the most physiological situation. To assess whether other signaling pathways are involved, we examined the Ras-MAPK-ERK pathway that is also activated by c-kit. Analysis of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 showed no significant inhibition by α-tocopherol, confirming that this pathway was not affected (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of PKB Phosphorylation by α-Tocopherol Involves the c-kit-PI3K Pathway—To better characterize the mechanism by which α-tocopherol acts on the phosphorylation of PKB, different inhibitors of the enzymes involved in the c-kit-PI3-kinase pathway were used. STI571, a known inhibitor of c-kit and similar tyrosine kinases such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and Abelson kinase completely inhibited PKB phosphorylation within a few minutes, at very low concentrations (50–1000 nm) in medium without serum (Fig. 3, A and B). This shows that the main pathway leading to PKB phosphorylation under these conditions is initiated by the c-kit receptor. In the presence of serum, STI571 inhibits PKB phosphorylation and serum-activated cell proliferation as well (data not shown), in agreement with results described by Heinrich et al. (13Heinrich M.C. Griffith D.J. Druker B.J. Wait C.L. Ott K.A. Zigler A.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 925-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with STI571 also reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. On the other hand, treatment with 1 μm wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3Ks, leads to inhibition of PKB phosphorylation, but does not influence phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A). Increase of PKB Phosphorylation by Specific PKC Inhibitors, but Not in the Presence of α-Tocopherol—PKB can be phosphorylated at two sites, Ser473 and Thr307. PDK-1 is responsible for the phosphorylation at Thr307, whereas the kinase for Ser473 is still unknown. Since it is known that α-tocopherol is able to inhibit PKC activity by stimulation of PP2A activity, leading to dephosphorylation and consequently to deactivation of PKC, it was possible that PKB is somehow regulated by PKC or PP2A. To assess the influence of PKC on PKB phosphorylation, two PKC inhibitors, PKC412 and Gö6976, were used. PKC412, a novel inhibitor of the classical PKCs, affected PKB phosphorylation in cells grown without growth factors, depending on the concentration. Lower concentrations (0.25–0.5 μm) caused an increase in phosphorylation; higher concentrations (0.75–1 μm) had an opposite effect leading to a decrease in phosphorylation of PKB (Fig. 3C). When used in combination with α-tocopherol pretreatment, the “stimulatory” effect of PKC412 at the lower concentration was abolished (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained using inactivation of PKC by Gö6976 in the presence or absence of α-tocopherol (Fig. 3C). To investigate the possible involvement of PP2A in the above effects on PKB phosphorylation, cells were pretreated with ethanol or α-tocopherol for 24 h in the absence of FCS followed by treatment with 50 nm okadaic acid, a concentration that leads to at least 70% inactivation of PP2A. In the control cells pretreated with ethanol an increase in PKB and GSK phosphorylation after treatment with OA for 2 h was visible, when compared with OA-untreated control, whereas in α-tocopherol-treated cells the phosphorylation was still decreased (Fig. 3D). In summary, the effect of α-tocopherol was also preserved when PKC was either inhibited by PKC inhibitors (PKC412; Gö6976) or stimulated by PP2A inhibitor (OA), suggesting that the affected pathway did not directly include PKC. δ-Tocopherol Inhibits Phosphorylation of PKB Stronger than α-Tocopherol—We decided to compare the effects of the tocopherols in more detail: α-tocopherol as the most physiological vitamin E form with equal growth inhibitory activity as γ-tocopherol; β-tocopherol as having the lowest growth inhibitory effect; and δ-tocopherol as the most potent. Interestingly, when comparing the effects of δ-tocopherol and α-tocopherol, δ-tocopherol showed a stronger inhibition of PKB phosphorylation but at a later time point after treatment. After 6 h of treatment with δ-tocopherol, no effect was observed. 24 h of treatment led to strong inhibition of phosphorylation of PKB, without any effect on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A, last two lanes). Treatment with δ-tocopherol for 24 or 48 h resulted also in partial cell detachment indicative of cell death (Fig. 1C), similar to the effects of STI571 and wortmannin, whereas with α-tocopherol only a few cells detached. Analysis of ERK1/2 and PKB phosphorylation status in the detached cells showed that wortmannin and δ-tocopherol gave similar results. Both inhibitors did not change phosphorylation of ERK1/2 despite complete inhibition of PKB phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, detached cells). The c"

Studies of Werner syndrome cells and biochemical studies of WRN suggest that WRN plays a role in several DNA metabolic pathways. WRN interacts with DNA polymerase β (pol β) and stimulates pol β strand displacement synthesis on a base excision repair (BER) intermediate in a helicase-dependent manner. In this report, we examined the effect of the major human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) and of pol β on WRN helicase activity. The results show that WRN alone is able to unwind several single strand break BER intermediates. However, APE1 inhibits WRN helicase activity on these intermediates. This inhibition is likely due to the binding of APE1 to nicked apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, suggesting that APE1 prevents the promiscuous unwinding of BER intermediates. This inhibitory effect was relieved by the presence of pol β. A model involving the pol β-mediated hand-off of WRN protein is proposed based on these results.

Since phenotypic changes with aging have been hypothesized to be attributed to the accumulation of oxidative products, the involvement of WRN in BER may contribute to the premature aging seen in WS patients.BER contains two subpathways, short patch and long patch BER (10Dianov G.

Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The first steps of BER are common to both subpathways. A DNA lesion is recognized by a damage-specific DNA N-glycosylase, which releases the damaged base moiety, and the DNA backbone is then typically cleaved by AP endonuclease 1 (APE1). In short patch BER, DNA polymerase β (pol β) subsequently adds a single nucleotide at the resulting gap followed by termini processing and the broken DNA strand is ligated to complete repair. In long patch BER, pol β carries out strand displacement synthesis starting from the APE1-induced strand break, displacing 2–10 nucleotides before the 5′-protruding flap is cleaved by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) and before the DNA strand is resealed by DNA ligase. This pathway involves other replicative proteins as well such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, replication protein A (RPA), and DNA polymerase δ (pol δ). Some evidence suggests that BER is a coordinated process in which BER intermediates are passed from one enzyme to the next in the pathway (17Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 18Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 19Bennett R.A.

Recently, a NEILs (Nei-like)/polynucleotide kinase-dependent BER pathway was reported (20Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Karimi-Busheri F. Rasouli-Nia A. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Izumi T. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). NEILs acts as the initial glycosylase on certain base damages, generating a 3′-phosphate terminus, and then polynucleotide kinase removes this 3′-blocking group prior to repair synthesis and ligation.Extracts from WS cells efficiently repaired a plasmid containing a hydrolytic (natural) abasic (AP) site in vitro and are thought to be proficient in short patch BER (21Bohr V.A.

In contrast, biochemical studies demonstrate that WRN interacts physically and/or functionally with long patch BER proteins including pol δ, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, RPA, and FEN-1 (3Opresko P.L. Cheng W.H. von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). WRN interacts physically with FEN-1 and stimulates its DNA flap cleavage activity (22Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12204-12216Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As deficiencies in the removal of the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP)-containing flap could potentially lead to genome instability (24Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), the stimulation of FEN-1 activity by WRN suggests that WRN may participate in long patch BER. In addition, we recently demonstrated that wild-type WRN stimulates pol β strand displacement DNA synthesis on a nicked BER intermediate in vitro (25Harrigan J.A. Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C. Kedar P.S. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22686-22695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This reaction requires an active WRN helicase domain and involves unwinding of the nicked BER intermediate by WRN, suggesting that displacement of the downstream strand may be important for long patch BER. These findings are consistent with the possible role of WRN in long patch BER.This study examines WRN helicase activity on BER intermediates in the absence or presence of BER proteins. The results show that WRN unwinds BER intermediates in the absence of other BER factors. We also demonstrate that WRN physically interacts with APE1 and that APE1 inhibits WRN unwinding of BER intermediates. This inhibition is alleviated by the presence of pol β. The implication of these results for the regulation of BER is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase was purchased from New England Biolabs.

Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C. Kedar P.S. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22686-22695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that WRN may interact specifically with BER intermediates and/or BER protein complexes and that these interactions may regulate WRN helicase activity. This idea was investigated by carrying out WRN helicase assays with BER intermediates in the absence or presence of BER proteins.A 3′ end-labeled 34-bp duplex oligonucleotide containing a uracil at position 16 was treated with human UDG to generate a DNA substrate with an AP site (see Fig. 1A for substrates). The AP site-containing DNA was incubated with human APE1 to generate an incised AP site substrate (dRP-nick) with a 5′-dRP and a 3′-hydroxyl terminus. To verify the nature of the DNA substrates, they were reduced with NaBH4 or treated with human pol β and analyzed on a 20% sequencing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1B). The NaBH4-treated DNA is a 5′-dRP 18-mer, which migrates slightly faster than a 5′-phosphate 19-mer (p19), but slower than p18. The pol β-treated DNA (Fig. 1B, lane 2) co-migrates with p18 as this enzyme excises the 5′-dRP group (35Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 36Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This analysis confirms that the APE1-treated DNA has a 5′-dRP terminus and that 5′-dRP is removed by the dRP lyase activity of pol β. An F-nick substrate is a nicked DNA containing a tetrahydrofuran (termed F) at the 5′ end of the labeled 19-mer oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B, lane 5).To address whether WRN alone could unwind BER intermediates following the removal of all of the BER proteins by phenol/chloroform extraction, the above substrates were incubated with various concentrations of WRN under helicase reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, WRN efficiently unwound duplex DNA containing a 1-nucleotide gap, an F-nick, a dRP-nick, or a 3′-overhang. At 4 nm WRN, ∼70% labeled downstream primer of the four substrates was displaced. In contrast, blunt-ended duplex DNA containing an intact AP site was not a substrate for the WRN helicase (Fig. 2B). These findings demonstrated that BER strand break intermediates are substrates for WRN and suggested a potential role for WRN helicase activity in BER. We note that WRN unwinds nicked DNA with a 5′-dRP terminus or with a 5′-phosphate terminus produced following pol β dRP lyase activity on a 5′-dRP-nicked DNA substrate (data not shown). WRN helicase also unwinds dRP-nicked DNA in the presence of a dRP lyase-defective pol β (data not shown).Fig. 2WRN unwinds BER intermediates. A, 3′-radiolabeled DNA substrates (1 nm) were incubated with 1, 2, and 4 nm WRN as indicated for 15 min at 37 °C.

Thus, APE1 is present in large excess over DNA glycosylases and pol β (37Sokhansanj B.A. Rodrigue G.R. Fitch J.P. Wilson D.M. II I Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Chen D.S. Herman T. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The high level of APE1 may be required to efficiently repair the estimated 10,000 AP sites that accumulate in the mammalian genome per day (39Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4273) Google Scholar).The effect of APE1 on WRN helicase activity was examined by carrying out WRN helicase assays with dRP-nick and F-nick DNA substrates in the presence of APE1. The results show that WRN-catalyzed unwinding of all of the BER substrates decreased in the presence of increasing amounts of APE1 (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas WRN was able to effectively unwind the 19-mer downstream primers of the dRP-nick and F-nick substrates in the absence of APE1. The inhibition was severe on the F-nick substrate compared with the dRP-nicked substrate, even at lower concentrations of APE1 (4 nm) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, APE1 (up to 8 nm) did not affect WRN helicase activity on forked or 5′-recessed duplex DNA (Fig. 3C). APE1 is not expected to bind to forked or 5′-recessed duplex DNA with high affinity (40Erzberger J.P. Wilson D.M. II I J. Mol.

It is likely that a stable protein/DNA complex between APE1 and a BER intermediate protects DNA termini from undesired processing by other proteins. This finding suggests that the mechanism by which APE1 inhibits WRN is based on steric hindrance at AP-nick termini.Fig. 3APE1 inhibits WRN unwinding of BER intermediates.

Therefore, we explored whether APE1 and WRN directly interact. Initial studies using a pull-down assay with a C-terminal WRN fragment (GST-WRN949–1432) and a HeLa NE found that WRN co-precipitates with APE1 from HeLa NE (Fig. 4A, lane 3). The association of APE1 is specific with GST-WRN949–1432, as GST alone did not precipitate APE1 (Fig. 4A, lane 2). This finding suggests that WRN and APE1 may interact physically in vivo.Fig. 4WRN physically interacts with APE1. A, GST-WRN949–1432 pulls down APE1.

https://openalex.org/W2133695108,"Clinical studies of enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease have indicated that relatively high doses of recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (rhGAA) may be required to reduce the abnormal glycogen storage in cardiac and skeletal muscles. This may be because of inefficient cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR)-mediated endocytosis of the enzyme by the affected target cells. To address this possibility, we examined whether the addition of a high affinity ligand to rhGAA would improve its delivery to these cells. Chemical conjugation of high mannose oligosaccharides harboring mono- and bisphosphorylated mannose 6-phosphates onto rhGAA (neo-rhGAA) significantly improved its uptake characteristics by muscle cells in vitro. Infusion of neo-rhGAA into Pompe mice also resulted in greater delivery of the enzyme to muscle tissues when compared with the unmodified enzyme. Importantly, this increase in enzyme levels was associated with significantly improved clearance of glycogen (∼5-fold) from the affected tissues. These results suggest that CI-MPR-mediated endocytosis of rhGAA is an important pathway by which the enzyme is delivered to the affected lysosomes of Pompe muscle cells. Hence, the generation of rhGAA containing high affinity ligands for the CI-MPR represents a strategy by which the potency of rhGAA and therefore the clinical efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease may be improved.

Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II), is an inherited disorder of glycogen metabolism caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA) 1The abbreviations used are: GAA, acid α-glucosidase; ERT, enzyme replacement therapy; rhGAA, recombinant human acid α-glucosidase; CI-MPR, cation-independent M6P receptor; M6P, mannose 6-phosphate.1The abbreviations used are: GAA, acid α-glucosidase; ERT, enzyme replacement therapy; rhGAA, recombinant human acid α-glucosidase; CI-MPR, cation-independent M6P receptor; M6P, mannose 6-phosphate.

Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The deficiency of GAA results in the lysosomal accumulation of glycogen in multiple tissues, with the cardiac and skeletal muscles being most severely affected. Pompe disease manifests as a broad spectrum of clinical severity and course that correlates with the extent of enzyme deficiency (3Haley S.M. Fragala M.A. Skrinar A.M. Dev. Med.

This disorder has been arbitrarily classified with designations based on the age of onset of symptoms, extent of organ involvement, and rate of progression to death. The infantile form of the disease is uniformly lethal and is characterized by a near total lack of GAA activity and early onset of disease manifestations such as hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness, and profound hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with the infantile form of the disease invariably die around 1 year of age from cardiac failure (5van den Hout H.M. Hop W. van Diggelen O.P. Smeitink J.A. Smit G.P. Poll-The B.T. Bakker H.D.

However, progressive deterioration of the respiratory and skeletal muscles with age can lead to significant morbidity and in many instances early mortality, generally from respiratory failure. The disease is panethnic and has a combined incidence of ∼1:40,000 live births (11Martiniuk F. Chen A. Mack A. Arvanitopoulos E. Chen Y. Rom W.N. Codd W.J. Hanna B. Alcabes P. Raben N. Plotz P. Am.

Subsequent clinical studies in infantile Pompe subjects also showed that ERT was effective in clearing glycogen storage from the heart but to a lesser degree from the skeletal muscles. Associated with this reduction in lysosomal storage was an improvement in muscle function, reversal of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and an increase in the longevity of a proportion of the patients (21Van den Hout H.

However, the doses of rhGAA used in these clinical studies were relatively high, requiring 10–40 mg/kg/week, with partial clearance from skeletal muscle realized in some patients only at the 40 mg/kg/week dose (24Winkel L.P.F. Van den Hout J.M.P. Kamphoven J.H.J. Disseldorp J.A.M. Remmerswaal M. Arts W.F.M. Loonen M.C.B. Vulto A.G. Van Doorn P.A. de Jong G. Hop W. Smit G.P. Shapira S.K. Boer M.A. Van Diggelen O.P. Reuser A.J. Van der Ploeg A.T. Ann Neurol. 2004; 55: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the lower amounts of the respective lysosomal enzymes used in ERT of Gaucher, Fabry, and mucopolysaccharidosis type I patients, which typically range between 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, given biweekly (25Grabowski G.A. Barton N.W. Pastores G. Dambrosia J.M. Banerjee T.K. McKee M.A. Parker C. Schiffmann R. Hill S.C. Brady R.O. Ann. Intern.

The basis for the requirement of higher levels of rhGAA, particularly to treat the skeletal muscle, is unclear but may be related to the low density of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) that is present in this muscle (20Raben N. Danon M. Gilbert A.L. Dwivedi S. Collins B. Thurberg B.L. Mattaliano R.J. Nagaraju K. Plotz P.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Wenk J.

Metab. 1992; 75: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The CI-MPR-mediated pathway has been implicated as a major route for the internalization of rhGAA by cells in vitro and in vivo (1Hirschhorn R. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, NY2001: 3389-3420Google Scholar, 29Van der Ploeg A.T. Kroos M.A. Willemsen R. Brons N.H. Reuser A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Uptake by Pompe cells in vitro is significantly inhibited by the addition of excess mannose 6-phosphate (M6P), indicating that the majority of the enzyme is internalized via this pathway (30Yang H.W. Kikuchi T. Hagiwara Y. Mizutani M. Chen Y.T. Van Hove J.L. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 43: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This receptor likely also has an important role for internalizing rhGAA and other lysosomal enzymes in vivo. For example, a recent study with another lysosomal enzyme (β-glucuronidase) indicated that greater efficacy at reducing the storage in the affected tissues of the mucopolysaccharidosis VII knock-out mice could be realized with a mannose 6-phosphorylated enzyme than with a non-phosphorylated enzyme (31Sands M.S. Vogler C.A. Ohlemiller K.K. Roberts M.S. Grubb J.H. Levy B. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43160-43165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Another possible reason for the requirement of higher doses of rhGAA may be related to the relatively low affinity of the enzyme for the CI-MPR. The possibility that the affinity of rhGAA for the receptor may be less than optimal has been suggested from experiments showing that efficient uptake of the enzyme by Pompe cells, at least in vitro, requires the presence of high concentrations of the enzyme in the growth media. To address this potential limitation, high affinity ligands (phosphorylated oligomannose-containing oligosaccharides) were prepared and chemically conjugated onto the oligosaccharide side chains of rhGAA. We showed that the modified rhGAA (neo-rhGAA) containing a higher content of M6P residues displayed improved uptake characteristics into myoblasts in vitro and facilitated greater clearance of glycogen from the muscles of Pompe mice. These observations are consistent with the importance of the CI-MPR in lysosomal enzyme trafficking and support the continued evaluation of similar approaches to improve the targeting of the enzyme to Pompe-affected tissues.

Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10847-10858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The dialyzed oligosaccharides were adjusted to 2 mm Tris and then loaded onto a 20-ml QAE-Sephadex A column that had been equilibrated with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The column was washed sequentially with 2 mm Tris containing 20 mm and 70 mm NaCl, and the M6P-containing oligosaccharides were then eluted with 2 mm Tris containing 200 mm NaCl. The purified M6P-containing oligosaccharides and the phosphopentamannose were derivatized to glycosylhydrazines using the method of Tolvanen and Gahmberg (36Tolvanen M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol.

Chemical Conjugation of Derivatized M6P-containing Oligosaccharides onto rhGAA—Recombinant human α-glucosidase was dialyzed twice against 2 liters of 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.6) for 18 h at 4 °C. The dialyzed rhGAA (5 mg/ml) was oxidized with 2 mm sodium metaperiodate for 30 min on ice. Excess sodium metaperiodate was consumed by the addition of 0.5 ml of 50% glycerol and by incubating on ice for 15 min. The oxidized enzyme was then dialyzed against 2 liters of 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.6). Fifty-milligram aliquots of the oxidized rhGAA were conjugated to the hydrazine-derivatized M6P-containing oligosaccharides and phosphopentamannose (10 mg) by mixing and incubating at 37 °C for 2 h. After conjugation, both the M6P- and phosphopentamannose-conjugated rhGAA samples were dialyzed against 4 liters of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.75) containing 1% mannitol and 0.005% Tween 80 for 18 h at 4 °C and then filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Whatman). The samples were aliquoted, snapfrozen on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C until used.

Oligosaccharide profiling of the purified M6P-containing oligosaccharides following endoglycosidase Hf digestion of α-galactosidase A was performed according to the method of Townsend and Hardy (40Townsend R.R. Hardy M.R. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In Vitro Cell Uptake Studies—L6 myoblast cells (ATCC) were plated onto 12-well culture dishes and allowed to settle for 24 h. Prior to the addition of enzyme, the cells were washed once with 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Various forms of rhGAAs in 1 ml of uptake medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 25 mm Hepes (pH 6.8), 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and antibiotics) were then added and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. In some of the wells, 5 mm M6P was added to inhibit CI-MPR-mediated uptake. After 18 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm M6P and then twice more with phosphate-buffered saline alone. The cells were lysed in GAA assay buffer (0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.4 m potassium chloride, pH 4.3) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 by scraping followed by sonication. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the GAA activity in the cleared supernatants was assayed using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (17Van Hove J.L. Yang H.W. Wu J.Y. Brady R.O. Chen Y.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 9: 65-70Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The protein content in the cell lysates was determined using the microBCA kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. GAA activity in Pompe mice tissues was assayed using the same method except that the assay buffer contained 0.5% Triton X-100. Animal Studies—Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication 86-23). Four- to five-month-old Pompe mice (41Raben N. Nagaraju K. Lee E. Kessler P. Byrne B. Lee L. LaMarca M. King C. Ward J. Sauer B. Plotz P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19086-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) were used to evaluate the relative ability of various rhGAAs to reduce the glycogen storage in the affected tissues. Groups of Pompe mice (seven animals/group) were injected via the tail vein with vehicle and varying doses of rhGAA or neo-rhGAA. The mice were administered three weekly doses and were then sacrificed 2 weeks after the last treatment. Various tissues including the heart, diaphragm, and skeletal muscle were collected and stored at -80 °C until assayed. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by a Newman-Keuls test. A probability value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Measurement of Glycogen Levels—The glycogen content in the various muscles of the Pompe mice was assayed by measuring the difference in the amount of glucose released from a boiled tissue homogenate following digestion with or without Aspergillus niger amyloglucosidase as described previously (42Amalfitano A. McVie-Wylie A.J. Hu H. Dawson T.L. Raben N. Plotz P. Chen Y.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8861-8866Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The glucose levels were assayed using the Amplex Red glucose assay kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bovine liver glycogen was used as a standard. In some studies, glycogen content was measured using periodic acid-Schiff staining followed by computer-assisted histomorphometric analysis (MetaMorph) as described previously (20Raben N. Danon M. Gilbert A.L. Dwivedi S. Collins B. Thurberg B.L. Mattaliano R.J. Nagaraju K. Plotz P.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). All photography and MetaMorph analyses were performed in a blinded manner. Process for Chemically Conjugating M6P-containing Oligosaccharides onto rhGAA Did Not Affect Its Enzymatic Activity—Direct chemical conjugations of oligosaccharides onto a protein backbone via reductive amination or maleimide chemistries frequently require prolonged incubations at neutral to alkaline pH. These reaction conditions are destabilizing to lysosomal enzymes such as GAA that have optimal activities at acidic pH. To minimize the inactivation of these enzymes, a conjugation scheme was used that employed a condensation reaction between an aldehyde group and a hydrazine to form a hydrazone bond. In this scheme, M6P-containing oligosaccharides were derivatized to glycosylhydrazines and then conjugated (at acidic pH) to rhGAA, the sialic acids of which had been oxidized with periodate to aldehydes. Conjugating the M6P-containing moieties directly onto the existing oligosaccharide side chains of rhGAA also confers spacer length that could minimize the effect of steric hindrance during receptor binding. Using phosphopentamannose-hydrazine as a model ligand, we demonstrated that its conjugation onto rhGAA did not affect the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme (data not shown). Conjugation efficiency was determined to be high and to have occurred on nearly all rhGAA as evidenced by an increase in the binding of the phosphopentamannose-conjugated rhGAA to a CI-MPR column (Fig. 1). Although only ∼40% of the original rhGAA bound the CI-MPR column, the column retained more than 90% of the phosphopentamannose-conjugated rhGAA. Hence, the conjugation process used to modify the oligosaccharides on rhGAA was efficient and did not measurably alter its activity. However, conjugation with phosphopentamannose did not enhance its uptake into L6 myoblasts in vitro when compared with the unmodified enzyme (data not shown). This may be expected because phosphopentamannose is a relatively low affinity ligand for the CI-MPR (34Distler J.J. Guo J.F. Jourdian G.W. Srivastava O.P. Hindsgaul O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21687-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conjugation of Mono- and Bisphosphorylated Oligomannose Residues onto rhGAA Improved Its Binding to CI-MPR and Uptake into Cells in Vitro—To generate a modified rhGAA with a higher affinity ligand for the CI-MPR, M6P-containing oligosaccharides were isolated from recombinant human α-galactosidase A and conjugated onto rhGAA using the same scheme. Recombinant α-galactosidase A was used as a source of the oligosaccharides because analysis of its carbohydrate (Fig. 2a) indicated that 30–40% of the high mannose oligosaccharides are bisphosphorylated, a high affinity ligand for the CI-MPR. Phosphorylated high mannose oligosaccharides (both mono- and bisphosphorylated) were released from α-galactosidase A by endoglycosidase H treatment and purified over a QAE column. Conjugation of the purified mono- and bisphosphorylated oligosaccharides onto rhGAA (neo-rhGAA) resulted in an increase in the fraction of enzyme that bound to the CI-MPR column (Fig. 2b). Approximately 63% of the neo-rhGAA bound the CI-MPR column compared with ∼40% for the unmodified enzyme. The lower than expected fraction of neo-rhGAA (63% as opposed to ≥90% for phosphopentamannose-conjugated rhGAA) that bound the CI-MPR column was because smaller amounts of the phosphorylated oligosaccharides were used in the conjugation reaction. The increased binding of neo-rhGAA was not because of nonspecific interactions between the oxidized sialic acids on rhGAA and the CI-MPR column because periodate-treated but non-conjugated rhGAA displayed binding characteristics that were similar to those for untreated rhGAA (Fig. 2b). Monosaccharide analysis of the neo-rhGAA confirmed that the modified enzyme contained higher levels of phosphorylated oligomannose residues. The M6P content was increased from 0.9 mol M6P/mol for the unmodified rhGAA to 2.9 mol M6P/mol for the neo-rhGAA. Importantly, this increase in M6P-containing oligosaccharides on neo-rhGAA resulted in a significant enhancement in its uptake by L6 myoblasts (Fig. 3). Uptake of neo-rhGAA approached saturation at 100 nm compared with ∼500 nm for the unmodified rhGAA. This is consistent with an increase in the affinity of neo-rhGAA for the CI-MPR, presumably because of the conjugation of additional M6P-containing ligands. Uptake was completely blocked by the addition of excess M6P, confirming that the uptake of the enzyme by the L6 cells was primarily mediated via the CI-MPR (data not shown). Clearance of Glycogen from Pompe Mouse Tissues Was Improved with Neo-rhGAA—To determine whether the improved uptake characteristics of neo-rhGAA in vitro would lead to a greater reduction in glycogen storage in vivo, 4–5-month old Pompe mice were treated with either neo-rhGAA or unmodified rhGAA. Mice were administered three weekly doses and were killed 2 weeks after the last treatment. Approximately 24 and 46% higher enzyme levels were detected in the skeletal muscle and heart, respectively, of animals administered neo-rhGAA when compared with those treated with unmodified rhGAA. Treatment with either form of the enzyme resulted in a dosedependent reduction in the glycogen levels (Fig. 4). At equivalent doses, mice treated with neo-rhGAA uniformly displayed a greater extent of glycogen reduction in all the muscles analyzed (Fig. 4). In the heart, a ∼4–6-fold greater reduction in glycogen levels was attained with neo-rhGAA than with rhGAA at both the 10 and 20 mg/kg doses. Significantly higher reductions in glycogen levels were also observed in the other muscle tissues of animals that had been treated with the modified enzyme (Fig. 4). An ∼50% reduction in glycogen was attained with neo-rhGAA in the quadriceps muscles and to lesser extents in the triceps and diaphragm. In the quadriceps, treatment with unmodified rhGAA had no effect. In nearly all cases, the efficacy attained with only 20 mg/kg neo-rhGAA was similar to that achieved with 50 mg/kg unmodified rhGAA (Fig. 4). Consistent with previous data (20Raben N. Danon M. Gilbert A.L. Dwivedi S. Collins B. Thurberg B.L. Mattaliano R.J. Nagaraju K. Plotz P.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 43Raben N. Jatkar T. Lee A. Lu N. Dwivedi S. Nagaraju K. Plotz P.H. Mol. Ther. 2002; 6: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the skeletal muscles were more refractory to treatment than the heart even with neo-rhGAA, attaining a 50–60% reduction in glycogen at the 20 mg/kg dose compared with 95% for the heart (Fig. 4). The reduction in glycogen levels observed by biochemical analysis was confirmed by histomorphometric assessment of the quadriceps muscles obtained from the same animals (Fig. 5). Lysosomal glycogen following staining and analysis of the tissue samples by high resolution light microscopy appeared as discreet, purple-beaded structures scattered throughout each myocyte (Fig. 5a). With enzyme treatment, these glycogen-containing structures became smaller and fewer in number. The administration of 20 mg/kg neo-rhGAA resulted in a 54% reduction in the tissue area occupied by glycogen when compared with the vehicle-treated samples (Fig. 5b). This reduction was nearly as effective as the administration of 50 mg/kg unmodified rhGAA, which provided for a 60% reduction, suggesting that neo-rhGAA was 2–2.5 times more potent than rhGAA. Treatment with 10 mg/kg rhGAA resulted in a 17% reduction in glycogen (Fig. 5b). Because the extent of glycogen reduction at this dose was similar to that attained with 20 mg/kg rhGAA (Fig. 4), comparison of this result with that of 20 mg/kg neo-rhGAA (54% reduction) would indicate an ∼3-fold increase in potency with neo-rhGAA. The success of ERT for Pompe disease is dependent on the ability to deliver exogenously administered rhGAA to all of the affected tissues and to a level that is sufficient to effect a net reduction in lysosomal storage of glycogen. Because Chinese hamster ovary-derived rhGAA contains a mixture of high mannose and complex-type oligosaccharide side chains, uptake of the enzyme from the circulation is likely mediated by a number of cell surface receptors including the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate, asialoglycoprotein, and mannose receptors. Although the relative contributions of the different receptors remains unclear, there is evidence that the CI-MPR plays a significant role in the uptake of rhGAA and, indeed, the majority of the different lysosomal enzymes. For example, greater uptake of GAA by the heart and skeletal muscles was realized with an enzyme preparation that contained mannose 6-phosphorylated residues than one lacking this moiety (29Van der Ploeg A.T. Kroos M.A. Willemsen R. Brons N.H. Reuser A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Improved efficacy in treating another lysosomal storage disease animal model (mucopolysaccharidosis VII) was also observed when a highly mannose 6-phosphorylated β-glucuronidase was used in lieu of a non-phosphorylated preparation (31Sands M.S. Vogler C.A. Ohlemiller K.K. Roberts M.S. Grubb J.H. Levy B. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43160-43165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the abundance of the CI-MPR is relatively low in skeletal muscles, which may explain the low level of enzyme uptake by this tissue (20Raben N. Danon M. Gilbert A.L. Dwivedi S. Collins B. Thurberg B.L. Mattaliano R.J. Nagaraju K. Plotz P.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Wenk J. Hille A. von Figura K. Biochem.

Metab. 1992; 75: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This problem may also be exacerbated by the fact that delivery to the muscle fibers requires that the enzyme traverse not only the endothelial barrier but also the endomysium. The combined poor accessibility of the skeletal muscle fibers to systemically delivered rhGAA and the low abundance of the CI-MPR could account for the reported requirement of high doses of enzyme to treat this tissue (20Raben N. Danon M. Gilbert A.L. Dwivedi S. Collins B. Thurberg B.L. Mattaliano R.J. Nagaraju K. Plotz P.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 24Winkel L.P.F.

Reuser A.J. Van der Ploeg A.T. Ann Neurol. 2004; 55: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Given these considerations, several strategies could be envisaged to improve the treatment of Pompe-affected tissues. For example, increasing the potency of the enzyme by generating a modified GAA with higher specific activity or longer half-life may allow for delivery of smaller amounts of the enzyme for therapeutic efficacy. Another strategy is to improve the targeting of the enzyme to the affected tissues. This could be realized either by increasing the abundance of the CI-MPR at the cell surface or the affinity of the recombinant enzyme for the receptor(s). Characterization of the Chinese hamster ovary-derived rhGAA used in this study indicated that it had a relatively low affinity for the CI-MPR, at least when tested in vitro. Uptake of the enzyme by L6 myoblasts showed saturation at around 500 nm rhGAA. This approximates the dissociation constant (Kd) reported for a monophosphorylated oligosaccharide for the CI-MPR (34Distler J.J. Guo J.F. Jourdian G.W. Srivastava O.P. Hindsgaul O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21687-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the rhGAA was composed predominantly of this low affinity ligand. The addition of more M6P moieties onto rhGAA to generate neo-rhGAA increased its uptake into myoblasts in vitro. Uptake of neo-rhGAA was saturated at 50–100 nm. The higher than predicted Kd value observed with neo-rhGAA likely reflected the fact that both mono- and bisphosphorylated oligosaccharides were conjugated onto the enzyme. Additionally, it is also likely that not all of the rhGAA were successfully conjugated with the phosphorylated oligosaccharides. Based on the fraction of enzyme that bound the CI-MPR column prior to and following conjugation (Fig. 2b), it was estimated that only ∼38% of the neo-rhGAA was successfully conjugated with bisphosphorylated mannose 6-phosphates. Incomplete conjugation would also contribute to the higher than expected apparent Kd of neo-rhGAA for the CI-MPR (50–100 nm), which if mediated solely by bisphosphorylated mannose 6-phosphates should be ∼2 nm (44Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This modification of rhGAA to contain a higher affinity ligand for the CI-MPR was most likely responsible for the observed improved delivery of neo-rhGAA to the Pompe mouse muscles. Increased delivery of neo-rhGAA to the muscles was associated with greater clearance of glycogen from the tissues. After adjusting for the conjugation efficiency (38%), it was estimated that an improvement of ∼5-fold in skeletal muscle and 10-fold in heart was realized with neo-rhGAA. However, it is anticipated that further improvements in efficacy should be attainable through the judicious use of synthetic glycans containing the optimal configuration of M6P residues (34Distler J.J. Guo J.F. Jourdian G.W. Srivastava O.P. Hindsgaul O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21687-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Srivastava O.P. Hindsgaul O. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 161: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Use of synthetic glycans in lieu of the oligosaccharides released from α-galactosidase A should eliminate the addition of the low affinity monophosphorylated oligosaccharides and also minimize the number of free terminal mannose and galactose residues present on the oligosaccharides used for conjugation. The latter could have the effect of reducing the uptake of the modified enzyme by mannose and asialoglycoprotein receptors and thereby improve the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug. The improved efficacy associated with the use of such modified rhGAAs should in turn allow for a significant reduction in the dose required to clear the accumulated glycogen from the affected tissues. This is not a trivial benefit considering that significant clearance of glycogen from the skeletal muscle of Pompe mice treated with unmodified rhGAA was only observed at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Yet higher doses of rhGAA (100 mg/kg) were reportedly necessary if older Pompe animals (>6 months old) were used at the start of the study (20Raben N. Danon M. Gilbert A.L. Dwivedi S. Collins B. Thurberg B.L. Mattaliano R.J. Nagaraju K. Plotz P.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 80: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The basis for the requirement of higher doses to treat older animals is unclear but may be related to the extent of muscle damage and the declining abundance of the CI-MPR in the muscle with age (28Funk B. Kessler U. Eisenmenger W. Hansmann A. Kolb H.J. Kiess W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 75: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The data generated here supports the premise that the CI-MPR is involved in the uptake of a proportion of systemically delivered rhGAA, particularly by skeletal muscles. This is perhaps a not too surprising finding given the body of data reported in the literature thus far (29Van der Ploeg A.T. Kroos M.A. Willemsen R. Brons N.H. Reuser A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Yang H.W. Kikuchi T. Hagiwara Y. Mizutani M. Chen Y.T. Van Hove J.L. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 43: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that other receptors may also have a role in uptake of the enzyme, the extent of which remains to be determined. If that is correct, other ligands could be similarly exploited to augment the delivery of rhGAA to various Pompe-affected organs. A recent report using an insulin-like growth factor II-derived peptide to deliver β-glucuronidase is an example (47LeBowitz J.H. Grubb J.H. Maga J.A. Schmiel D.H. Vogler C. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3083-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The strategy of modifying the carbohydrate composition of an enzyme to improve its therapeutic effect is not without precedent. During the development of recombinant glucocerebrosidase for ERT of Gaucher disease, significantly improved efficacy was also realized after remodeling the carbohydrate on the enzyme to expose core mannose residues (25Grabowski G.A. Barton N.W. Pastores G. Dambrosia J.M. Banerjee T.K. McKee M.A. Parker C. Schiffmann R. Hill S.C. Brady R.O. Ann. Intern.

Acta. 1981; 673: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This modification facilitated greater binding of the enzyme to the mannose receptors present on affected Gaucher macrophages. The results here are consistent with these observations and argue that remodeling the carbohydrate of rhGAA, such that it becomes a higher affinity ligand for the CI-MPR or indeed for other receptors that may be present on the affected cells, represents a viable strategy to enhance the efficacy of ERT for Pompe disease.

https://openalex.org/W2096949377,"Strong exogenous electrical stimulation (ES) can induce changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i). It remains to be elucidated, however, whether physiologically relevant ES (e.g., 1-2 V/cm) could alter [Ca2+]i. We have used fluorescence microscopy to quantify [Ca2+]i changes in response to direct current (dc) ES in human fetal osteoblasts. Increases in [Ca2+]i in response to 2 V/cm ES show a noticeable (20-min) time delay, followed by a 45-fold rise from the baseline of 40 nM to 1.8 microM. Treatment of cells with verapamil does not affect ES-induced [Ca2+]i increases, but inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) does prevent such increases, which suggests that receptor-regulated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is likely to be involved. Treatment of cells with the stretch-activated cation channel (SACC) blocker Gd3+ partially inhibits ES-induced [Ca2+]i increases, as does chelation of intracellular Ca2+. These results are consistent with a model in which physiologically relevant ES does not activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) directly, but rather stimulates PLC-coupled cell surface receptors that induce [Ca2+]i increases by activating IP3-dependent intracellular processes. The Ca2+ influx that follows PLC activation is likely mediated by activation of mechanically operated SACCs."

It is less evident to foresee how this can be accomplished by camelid heavy-chain antibodies lacking light chains. Although these antibodies are subjected to somatic hypermutation, their antigen-binding fragment consists of a single domain with restricted flexibility in favor of binding energy. An antigen-binding domain derived from a dromedary heavy-chain antibody, cAb-Lys3, accumulated five amino acid substitutions in CDR1 and CDR2 upon maturation against lysozyme.

However, transition state analysis of the binding kinetics of mature cAb-Lys3 and germ line variants show that the maturation of this antibody relies on events late in the reaction pathway. This is reflected by a limited perturbation of ka and a significantly decreased kd upon maturation. In addition, binding reactions and the maturation event are predominantly enthalpically driven. Therefore, maturation proceeds through the increase of favorable binding interactions, or by the reduction of the enthalpic penalty for desolvation, as opposed to large entropic penalties associated with conformational changes and structural plasticity. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the mutant with a restored germ line CDR2 sequence illustrates that the matured hydrophobic core of CDR1 in cAb-Lys3 might be compensated in the germ line precursor by burying solvent molecules engaged in a stable hydrogen-bonding network with CDR1 and CDR2.

Both domains display high sequence diversity, mainly concentrated in three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) in each V domain. Structurally, these regions form loops, clustered at the N-terminal side of the folded domain, and provide the antigen contacts. Upon antigenic challenge, somatic hypermutation or gene conversion mechanisms further diversify the V sequences as well as the affinities of reactive B-cell receptors. A clonal selection system then enriches for those B-lymphocytes that display receptors with a higher affinity for the antigen. This process of somatic hypermutation and clonal selection is known as antibody (or B-cell receptor) affinity maturation (2Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1996; 49: 451-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Neuberger M.S. Ehrenstein M.R. Klix N. Jolly C.J. Yelamos J. Rada C. Milstein C. Immunol.

It has been reported on several occasions that antibody paratopes for haptenic molecules or small peptides lose conformational plasticity upon maturation. Wedemayer et al. (5Wedemayer G.J. Patten P.A. Wang L.H. Schultz P.G. Stevens R.C. Science. 1997; 276: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) showed by x-ray crystallography that the anti-hapten antibody 48G7 acquired mutations that result in the pre-organization of the reactive conformation of a highly flexible germ line paratope, in the mature antibody. The observed conformational changes include large rigid body movements between VH and VL as well as backbone and side-chain rearrangements within the hypervariable CDR loops. Manivel et al. (6Manivel V. Sahoo N.C. Salunke D.M. Rao K.V. Immunity. 2000; 13: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) observed that large entropic penalties were associated with antibodies from primary responses binding to a synthetic peptide. These penalties were significantly reduced upon maturation. In sharp contrast, a detailed analysis of the effects of the adaptations introduced during the affinity maturation of paratopes against larger antigens remains elusive. However, by comparing HyHEL10 variants at different maturation stages, Li et al. (7Li Y. Li H. Yang F. Smith-Gill S.J. Mariuzza R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) indicated that the antigen maturation for this antibody results in an increased complementarity involving a fraction of the apolar buried surface area of the paratope but not by its pre-organization. Camelidae possess, in addition to classic IgG molecules, a large fraction of naturally occurring heavy-chain antibodies that are devoid of light chains (8Muyldermans S. Cambillau C. Wyns L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 230-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Nature. 1993; 363: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). The variable domain of camel heavy-chain antibodies (VHH) is assembled by V-D-J gene rearrangement but is distinct from the VH of classic antibodies. Different sets of germ line VH and VHH genes encode the V-germ line repertoire in the camelid genome, whereas the D and J genes are shared between both antibody classes. The affinity maturation process in camelid antibodies remains unexplored apart from the comparisons between cDNA and germ line V-gene segments that revealed the presence of a somatic hypermutation mechanism in camel heavy-chain antibodies (10Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Due to the absence of the VL domain in camelid heavy-chain antibodies, it is evident that inter-domain movements cannot contribute to the flexibility of the paratope. In addition, the frequent occurrence of interloop disulfide bridges and the high percentage of backbone atoms involved in antigen contacts (8Muyldermans S. Cambillau C. Wyns L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 230-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) may considerably reduce the paratope flexibility. Therefore, the occurrence of a rigidification process of the paratope in heavy-chain antibodies during affinity maturation, as observed for classic antibodies, remains an open question. In this report we constructed germ line revertants of the hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL)-specific VHH, cAb-Lys3 (11Decanniere K. Transue T.R. Desmyter A. Maes D. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Dao-Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The matured VHH and the germ line revertants were subsequently subjected to a transition state analysis using surface plasmon resonance technology. The enthalpic and entropic contributions in the cAb-Lys3-HEWL association were determined to evaluate the plasticity and interaction strengths of the interface residues during the course of affinity maturation. In addition, the crystal structure of the CDR2 loop germ line revertant was solved to provide a structural understanding of the biophysical parameters of the affinity maturation process. Reagents—All reagents were analytical grade. HEWL was purchased from Roche Applied Science. PDEA, EDC, NHS, ethanolamine, and 1,4-dithioerythritol were obtained from Biacore AB, and cystamine was obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen. Design and Construction of the Germ Line Revertants—We chose to evaluate the maturation event by restoring the complete or separate CDR1 and CDR2 germ line sequences of cAb-Lys3. This “cassette” reversion was chosen over the evaluation of individual mutations, because the sequential order of the mutations in the antigen maturation event cannot be traced, and some combinations of amino acid mutations might impose unacceptable loop foldings. The germ line revertants are referred to as cAb-Lys3gl2, cAb-Lys3gl1, and cAb-Lys3gl1&2, for the reversion of the CDR2, CDR1, and the complete germ line sequences, respectively. The antibody carrying the affinity matured sequence, is referred to as cAb-Lys3m. The cAb-Lys3gl2, cAb-Lys3gl1, and cAb-Lys3gl1&2 were all generated by PCR using mutagenic primers. The cAb-Lys3 gene cloned into a pHEN4 vector (13Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) was used as template for the PCR reactions. The cAb-Lys3gl2 mutant was generated by PCR using a mutagenic primer P1 (5′-GCA-GCA-ATT-AAT-AGT-GGT-GGT-GGT-AGC-ACA-TAC-3′, an AseI restriction site is underlined) annealing at the end of the framework 2 up to codon 58 of CDR2 in the cAb-Lys3 sequence and the primer AM006 (5′-CGT-TAG-TAA-ATG-AAT-TTT-CTG-TAT-GAG-G-3′) annealing in the vector sequence downstream of the cAb-Lys3 gene. An AseI generated fragment of cAb-Lys3m-pHEN4 that contained the 5′-end of cAb-lys3 and part of the pHEN4 vector sequence was annealed with the AseI-digested PCR product and further amplified with universal reverse primer and AM006. The amplification product was then digested with HindIII and BstEII, ligated into a HindIII/BstEII double digested cAb-Lys3-pHEN4 vector and transformed into Escherichia coli. The cAb-Lys3gl1 reversion mutant was constructed using splicing by overlap extension from two PCR fragments with a 15-nucleotide overlap in their CDR1 coding areas. One fragment resulted from a PCR with reverse primer annealing in the pHEN4 vector sequence and a mutagenic forward primer SV2 (5′-A-GCT-ACT-GTA-GGT-GTA-TCC-TGA-G-GC-TG-3′) annealing in the CDR1 area of cAb-Lys3m (the Bsu36I site, introduced for screening purposes is underlined). The second fragment resulted from amplification between a universal forward primer annealing in the pHEN4 vector and a mutagenic primer SV1 (5′-AC-ACC-TAC-AGT-AGC-TAC-TGT-ATG-GG-3′) annealing in the CDR1 codons of cAb-lys3m. The spliced fragments were amplified with reverse primer and forward primer, digested with HindIII and BstEII, and ligated in a HindIII/BstEII double digested cAb-Lys3m-pHEN4 vector (13Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and transformed into E. coli. The strategy to construct cAb-Lys3gl1&2 was similar to that of cAb-Lys3gl1 except that the cAb-Lys3gl2-pHEN4 was used as template. Finally, all mutants were recloned into a cAb-Lys3-pHEN6 vector (containing a C-terminal His6-encoded tag) (14Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) by digestion with HindIII and BstEII, gel purification and ligation in a HindIII/BstEII double digested cAb-Lys3-pHEN6 vector and transformation into E. coli. All mutant genes were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Expression and Purification—Periplasmic expression, extraction, and purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration of mutants and cAb-Lys3m were performed according to Lauwereys et al. (14Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The concentration of the mutants and wild type cAb-Lys3 was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the calculated sequence based extinction coefficient (15Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar), which is equal to 27,220 m-1 cm-1 for the cAb-Lys3 variants: cAb-Lys3m and cAb-Lys3gl2, or 25,730 m-1 cm-1 for the cAb-Lys3 variants: cAb-Lys3gl1 and cAb-Lys3gl1&2. Immobilization of PDEA-modified Lysozyme—Lysozyme was modified with PDEA (2-(2-pyrinidyldithio)ethaneamine) to introduce reactive disulfide groups before immobilization via surface thiol coupling, as described in the BIAapplications handbook. This immobilization method was chosen based on the closest approximation to a 1:1 binding model for the binding of mutants and cAb-Lys3m to the immobilized ligand (16De Genst E. Areskough D. Decanniere K. Muyldermans S. Andersson K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 29897-29907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PDEA-modified lysozyme dissolved in 10 mm NaAc buffer, pH 5.5, was coupled to CM5 chips at a rate of 5 μl/min. The first flow cell was incubated with 35 μl of EDC/NHS and subsequently with 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, and served as a reference surface for the kinetic measurements. The second flow cell (fc2) was used to immobilize PDEA-modified lysozyme at 200 resonance units. This was performed by treating fc2 with 10 μl of EDC/NHS and subsequently with 15 μl of cystamine dihydrochloride, followed by 15 μl of 1,4-dithioerythritol. Manual injection of the PDEA-modified lysozyme was then performed until the aimed immobilization level was obtained. Excess of reactive thiols on the chip were deactivated by 20 μl of 20 mMPDEA-1 m NaCl. Measurements/Fittings/Calculations—A Biacore® 3000 instrument was used to obtain binding of cAb-Lys3m and the germ line mutants at 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C, at 30 μl/min, with PBS supplemented with 3 mm EDTA and 0.005% surfactant P20 as running buffer. Replicate runs were performed on a different chip, which made the measurements independent. Each VHH was measured at four protein concentrations ranging from 12 μm to 31 nm, depending on the affinity of the mutant for HEWL. The mutants were injected for 2 min, and dissociation data were collected during 10 min. Regeneration after each cycle was performed using 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 1.0, for 2 min. Control injections using 1500 nm cAb-Lys3m in PBS was performed before and after five kinetic cycles to confirm that the activity of the immobilized HEWL did not change over time. Zero concentration data (injection of buffer alone) was always subtracted from the sensorgrams before fitting. Kinetic parameters were obtained by global fitting of the sensorgrams to a 1:1 model using BIAevaluation 3.1 software. The Rmax parameter, representing the binding capacity of the chip, was fixed to the average equilibrium response of the control injections. Calculation of the Transition State Enthalpy and Entropy—The enthalpy and entropy of equilibrium and activation for the interaction of each cAb-Lys3 variant was estimated using the equations: ΔG°=RT ln(KD)=ΔH°−TΔS°=RT ln(kdh/χT)−RT ln(kah/χT)=Δ‡Gdiss°−Δ‡Gass°, where R is the Rydberg gas constant; χ the Boltzmann constant; T the absolute temperature; ka (m-1 s-1) and kd (s-1), respectively, the association and dissociation rate constant of binding; KD (m) the dissociation constant; ΔG°, Δ‡Gass°, and Δ‡Gdiss° are the standard Gibbs free energies of binding, association, and dissociation, respectively. By plotting ln(kdh/χT) versus 1/T and ln(kah/χT) versus 1/T, better known as Eyring plots, we obtain from the slopes -Δ‡Hdiss°/R and -Δ‡Hass°/R and from the intercepts Δ‡Sdiss°/R and Δ‡Sass°/R, respectively (17Ito W. Yasui H. Kurosawa Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Structure Solution of the cAb-Lys3gl2 Revertant— Crystals of cAb-Lys3gl2 in complex with HEWL were grown at 4 mg/ml by hanging drop vapor diffusion with 2 m sodium formate and 100 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, as precipitant solution. The crystal used for data collection was frozen after transfer into the precipitant solution supplemented with 20% glycerol. Synchrotron data for the crystals were obtained at the BW7B beamline of EMBL synchrotron facility at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) (project number: PX-02-16), using a Marresearch image plate detector. Data were processed to 1.5-Å using DENZO and Scalepack (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The AMORE program (19Navaza J.

Ontogeny and Somatic Hypermutation of cAb-Lys3—A search in the VHH germ line data base (10Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) revealed that cAb-Lys3 originated most probably from the cvhhp11 germ line gene (AJ245159, 93.7% identity). From the known camelid J sequences 3V. K. Nguyen, personal communication for dromedary J genes and AF305952 for llama J genes.JH3 was identified as the most likely recombined J segment to arrive at the cAb-Lys3 gene. The original D gene used to generate the CDR3 of cAb-Lys3 remains elusive at this stage, because the D gene data base of camelids is not yet available. The generation of the cAb-Lys3 sequence required 18 nucleotide substitutions in the cvhhp11 germ line gene. Approximately two-thirds of these substitutions are located in the CDR areas (Fig. 1). In the coding strand, the purines are more frequently mutated than pyrimidines (Table II). Such purine/pyrimidine bias has also been reported for the somatic hypermutation in mouse and human VHs and reflects the strand preference for mutation (2Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1996; 49: 451-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, the transition versus transversion mutation bias, which equals 0.5 in mouse VHs is significantly different from the 0.33 value found for the cvhhp11 to cAb-Lys3 substitutions (2Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1996; 49: 451-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IINucleotide substitutions from the cvhhp11 germ line gene to cAb-Lys3cAb-Lys3AGCTTotalcvhhp11A2316G2226C0112T2114 Open table in a new tab The “mutation hotspot” (Pu-G-PY) sequences are very susceptible to substitution during the somatic maturation process (2Milstein C. Neuberger M.S. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1996; 49: 451-485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cvhhp11 germ line gene contains nine of these mutation hotspots in the CDR, and fourteen occur in the framework regions. Four mutation hotspots of the CDR area are actually modified in the cAb-Lys3 gene. Remarkably, only two hotspots residing within the area encoding the framework regions are altered. The alignment of the cvhhp11 and cAb-Lys3 amino acid sequences revealed seven amino acid replacements. Five of these replacements are located in the CDRs, of which three (Tyr-29 → Ile, Ser-30 → Gly, and Ser-31 → Pro) occur in the CDR1 and two (Ser-52a → Met and Ser-56 → Ile) are located in the CDR2 (Figs. 1 and 2A). Localization of Substituted Residues in the VHH Paratope Structure—All five CDR residues that were replaced during affinity maturation of cAb-Lys3, cluster in the folded domain and are located at the periphery of the VHH-HEWL interface (Fig. 2B). The change in solvent-accessible surface area (ΔASA) of the “matured amino” acids Ile-29, Gly-30, Pro-31, Met-52a, and Ile-56 upon antigen binding equals 122 Å2. This represents nearly 50% of the total ΔASA of the V-germ line encoded part of the paratope. Remarkably, out of these five amino acids only Ile-29 and Ile-56 have atoms within a distance of 4.0 Å of the antigen (Fig. 2C). Ile-29 contacts the HEWL side chains of Trp-62L and Leu-75L, and Ile-56 has atoms within 4 Å of Asp-48L and Thr-47L. In contrast to the Ile-29 and Ile-56, the remaining three matured amino acids do not participate in direct antigen recognition and seem to have rather a structural role. The φ and φ angles adopted by Gly-30 allow Pro-31 (in a cis-configuration) to pack against Tyr-27 and Met-34, thereby forming a stable hydrophobic core (Fig. 2C). Residue Met-52a of the CDR2 loop packs against Met-34 and Pro-31 (Fig. 2C), thereby extending the hydrophobic core of the CDR1 loop. Temperature Dependence of the VHH-HEWL Kinetics and Affinity—The kinetic rate constants ka and kd of the interactions between HEWL and the cAb-Lys3 variants were determined at four different temperatures (20, 25, 30, and 35 °C) by surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 3). All binding curves fitted well to a simple 1:1 “lock and key” binding model, consistent with recognition of two rigid molecules deprived from large conformational changes upon binding (22Karlsson R. Fält A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These data are graphically represented in a RaPID plot (Fig. 3), which is a convenient two-dimensional display of the ka and kd values of each interacting pair. The diagonal lines of the plot reflect the iso-affinity interactions. A glance at this plot immediately reveals that the largest gain during affinity maturation originates from the improvement of kd, whereas the ka constant was only moderately affected (at most by a factor 4) during maturation from germ line to cAb-Lys3m. Therefore, the observed ΔΔG° values for the reversion to the CDR2 (cAb-Lys3gl2), CDR1 (cAb-Lys3gl1), and to the complete V-germ line sequence (cAb-Lys3gl1&2), which is, respectively, equal to 1.1, 2.6, and 3.5 kcal/mol, are primarily determined by differences in off-rates. The ΔH and TΔS Contributions to Activation, Dissociation, and Equilibrium Free Energies—Eyring plots derived from the kinetic association and dissociation data are linearly decreasing (R2 of more than 0.95) for all cAb-Lys3 variants (Fig. 4, A and B). From the slopes and intercepts of these Eyring plots we retrieve the activation enthalpy and entropy contributions to the association free energy (Δ‡Gass°), dissociation free energy (Δ‡Gdiss°) and the free energy of binding (ΔG°) for each cAb-Lys3 variant (Fig. 4, C–E). The formation of the VHH-HEWL transition state for each cAb-Lys3 variant, has a large entropy and enthalpy penalty (Fig. 4F). The enthalpy barriers, however, are significantly higher than those of the entropy, except for the cAb-Lys3gl1-HEWL association, where both energies are equally unfavorable. The entropy barriers in the cAb-Lys3gl1&2-HEWL and cAb-Lys3m-HEWL associations are equal. The slight difference in transition state energy (Δ‡Gass°=Δ‡Hass°−TΔ‡Sass°) between both variants originates from a 0.6-kcal/mole difference in enthalpy penalty in favor of the cAb-Lys3m-HEWL transition state. Conversely, the HEWL interactions with the intermediate matured variants, cAb-Lys3gl1 and cAb-Lys3gl2, show significant differences in both Δ‡Hass° and TΔ‡Sass°. However, the overall transition state energy (Δ‡Gass°=Δ‡Hass°−TΔ‡Sass°) for these variants is almost equal to those of cAb-Lys3m and cAb-Lys3gl1&2. High enthalpy and entropy barriers (Δ‡Hdiss° and TΔ‡Sdiss°) (Fig. 4D) are also observed upon dissociation of the VHH-HEWL complexes for all variants. Here again, the enthalpy barriers are significantly higher than those of the entropy. These enthalpy barriers of dissociation increase slightly upon maturation (ΔΔ‡Hdiss°=1.4 kcal/mol for cAb-Lys3gl1&2→cAb-Lys3m). The entropy penalties (TΔ‡Sdiss°) in the dissociation event differ between cAb-Lys3gl1&2 and cAb-Lys3m by 1.0 kcal/mole. Enthalpy and entropy contributions to the ΔG° of the equilibrium binding reaction of each mutant to HEWL are shown in Fig. 4E. For all variants, except for the cAb-Lys3gl1-HEWL interaction, which"
https://openalex.org/W2119267064,"Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma. An excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and defective endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms may be present in asthma. Reduced glutathione (GSH) is one of the most important reducing agents against oxidant free radicals. A reducing agent, L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTC), a prodrug of cysteine, increases intracellular GSH. We have used a mouse model for asthma to determine effects of OTC on allergen-induced bronchial inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness. The administration of OTC reduced bronchial inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness. ROS generation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids was increased by ovalbumin (OVA) inhalation, but this increase was diminished by administration of OTC. The increased IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and eosinophil cationic protein levels in lungs after OVA inhalation were significantly reduced by the administration of OTC. In addition, the increased expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, RANTES, and eotaxin in lungs after OVA inhalation was significantly reduced by the administration of OTC. We also showed that the increased NF-kappaB levels in nuclear protein extracts of lung tissues at 72 h after OVA inhalation were decreased by the administration of OTC. These findings suggest that OTC may reduce airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness through regulation of NF-kappaB activity."

Nucleotide incorporation opposite G-AF is achieved in solution and in the crystal, revealing how the polymerase accommodates and replicates past G-AF, but not G-AAF. Like an unmodified guanine, G-AF adopts a conformation that allows it to form Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds with an opposing cytosine that results in protrusion of the bulky fluorene moiety into the major groove.

Gasser V. Fuchs R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Bypass of blocking lesions thus involves the concerted action of replicative and specialized DNA polymerases, a process described by the so-called “polymerase switch model” (3Pages V. Fuchs R.P.

The different effects of G-AAF and G-AF on replication have been postulated to depend upon the conformation these adducts can adopt (for a review, see Ref. 2Hoffmann G.R. Fuchs R.P.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In duplex DNA, G-AF induces subtle structural alterations to preferentially adopt a stable “outside binding” anti conformation, where the guanine retains cognate Watson-Crick bonds with an opposing cytosine as the fluorene ring projects into the major groove (15Eckel L.M. Krugh T.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13611-13624Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Mao B. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J.

G-AAF is restricted from adopting this anti conformation by its N-acetyl group. As a consequence, G-AAF adducts impose a major destabilization of the helix by adopting an “inserted” syn conformation where the fluorene ring intercalates into the DNA, displacing the bases to partially denature the helix (17Daune M.P.

Mechanisms of high-fidelity replication that are shared in large part by all polymerases, have been revealed by structural studies of DNA polymerase complexes (35Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. Curr.

Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 47Johnson S.J. Taylor J.S. Beese L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3895-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). During the replicative cycle, the high-fidelity polymerase subjects bases and base pairs to conformational and geometric scrutiny through a series of sites to achieve accurate replication (Fig. 1B). Prior to incorporation, a template base is sequestered at the preinsertion site, a pocket with steric restrictions imposed by the surrounding O and O1 helices. Upon a conformational change of these helices from an “open” to a “closed” conformation, the template base transitions to the insertion site where it must adopt a anti conformation to form a Watson-Crick base pair with the incoming dNTP. At the insertion site, base pairs that exhibit the shape and geometry of Watson-Crick base pairs are selected for, whereas base pairs that do not are selected against. Following formation of the new phosphodiester bond, the polymerase readopts the open conformation and the newly formed base pair translocates to the postinsertion site where polymerase side chains interact with the minor groove of correctly formed base pairs. The extensive interactions between the DNA minor groove and the polymerase surface suggest that DNA adducts at the major groove are better tolerated than adducts that protrude into the minor groove. Only by adopting an anti conformation could G-AF and G-AAF project the fluorene moiety into the major groove, thereby retaining protein-DNA interactions important to further DNA synthesis. We have determined structures of G-AF as it undergoes one round of accurate replication. At the preinsertion site, G-AF adopts a syn conformation compatible with dNTP incorporation, well positioned to maneuver a transition to an anti conformation at the insertion site where it can pair with an incoming dCTP. By contrast, G-AAF cannot maneuver this transition as it is restricted from adopting an anti conformation because of steric hindrance imposed by its N-acetyl group. Consistent with both structural and biochemical data, incorporation of dCTP opposite G-AF, but not G-AAF, was observed. Following incorporation of dCTP in the crystal, G-AF adopts an anti conformation at the postinsertion site, forming Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds with the opposing cytosine as the fluorene moiety projects into the solvent-exposed major groove. Structures of G-AF prior to and following dCTP incorporation reveal distortions to the polymerase active site that resemble distortions induced by DNA mismatches and lesions that reduce the efficiency of DNA replication. Preparation of AF-modified DNA Duplexes—Chemical modification of an oligonucleotide (5′-ACTGCACCATCCCTp) containing a single guanine residue with N-acetoxy-N-2-acetylaminofluorene to yield an oligonucleotide containing a single G-AAF adduct was performed as previously described (48Koehl P. Burnouf D. Fuchs R.P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The G-AAF-containing nucleotide was converted to G-AF by alkaline deacetylation in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol to prevent further oxidation (4Belguise-Valladier P. Fuchs R.P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 49Norman D. Abuaf P. Hingerty B.E. Live D. Grunberger D. Broyde S. Patel D.J.

Burnouf D. Fuchs R.P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), lyophilized, and then dissolved in a solution containing 10 mm cacodylate buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgSO4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. AF-modified oligonucleotide was annealed to complementary oligonucleotide, 11-mer (5′-AGGGATGGTGC) or 10-mer (5′-AGGGATGGTG), to generate a DNA duplex where the AF lesion was positioned at the template n-1 and n position, respectively. In Vitro Nucleotide Incorporation Opposite AF and AAF by BF—AF- or AAF-modified template oligonucleotides and an unmodified template identical in sequence were annealed to a 5′ 32P-labeled complementary 10-mer oligonucleotide positioning G-AF, G-AAF, or an unmodified guanine as the n template base. The primer was extended (standard reaction conditions 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, and 4% glycerol, 200 nm annealed duplex, 0.1 mm dNTP, 20 °C) with 0.5 and 1.0 nm BF for nucleotide incorporation opposite unmodified guanine and G-AF or G-AAF, respectively. At each time point, 10 μl of the reaction mix was withdrawn and quenched with 30 mm EDTA (final concentration). Primers and products were separated by electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide/8 M urea) and visualized (Amersham Biosciences 445SI Phosphorimager). Crystallization of BF with AF-modified DNA Duplexes and Catalysis in the Crystal—Purification of BF and crystallization with DNA substrates were performed as described previously (46Kiefer J.R.

A. 2003; 100: 3895-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) with AF-modified DNA duplexes used in place of unmodified DNA duplexes. Incorporation of dCTP opposite G-AF was performed by transferring BF-DNA co-crystals into solutions containing 30 mm dCTP as described previously for accurate DNA synthesis in the BF-DNA crystal (47Johnson S.J. Taylor J.S. Beese L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3895-3900Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Superposition—Crystals were transferred to cryoprotectant solution (60% saturated ammonium sulfate, 24% sucrose, 100 mm MES, pH 5.8) prior to being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 98 K using a RAXIS-II or RAXIS-IV detector (Molecular Structure) on a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator operated at 50 mA and 100 kV with λ (CuKα) = 1.542 Å and processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (51Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Diffraction resolution was limited by the edge of the detector. Data for the BF co-crystal structure with C:G-AF at the post-IS was 77% complete at 2.0 Å. The co-crystals belong to spacegroup P212121 and contain one molecule/asymmetric unit. Phases were calculated using molecular replacement (PDB accession code 2BDP as the probe) and models refined using crystallography NMR software (52Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Force field and topology parameters allowing multiple sugar pucker conformations were used for the DNA and were modified to include parameters for the G-AF residue generated using XPLO2D (53Kleywegt G.J.

Superpositions of the Cα atoms of BF residues 646–655, 823–838, and 863–869 were done using LSQMAN (57Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Replication of G-AF and G-AAF in Solution and in BF Crystals—AF- and AAF-modified DNA duplexes were used to determine the ability of BF to incorporate nucleotide opposite G-AF and G-AAF in solution and in the crystal. Incorporation of dCTP opposite G-AF is observed in solution but occurs less efficiently than dCTP incorporation opposite unmodified guanine (Fig. 2A). Replication fidelity is retained as extended primers were only observed with dCTP and not other dNTPs. By contrast, G-AAF blocks DNA replication by BF as incorporation of dCTP was not observed (Fig. 2B). The ability to observe DNA synthesis in BF polymerase crystals allowed us to determine structures of G-AF before (Fig. 3) and after (Fig. 4) dCTP incorporation. These structures, solved to 2.1 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively (Table I), show G-AF positioned at two sites: the template preinsertion site (n) and the postinsertion site (n-1). The latter structure was indistinguishable from a co-crystal structure of BF bound to a DNA duplex that contained a C:G-AF (primer:template) base pair at the postinsertion site (Table I).Fig. 4Structure of BF with G-AF at the postinsertion site.A, structure of BF bound to G-AF at the postinsertion site (blue) superimposed with a structure of BF bound to an unmodified base at the postinsertion site (gray).

The G-AF template base (n) adopts a syn conformation and is accommodated by the preinsertion site, but with a disordered O1 helix. The fluorene moiety makes extensive van der Waals contacts with the preinsertion site surface and is essentially buried from solvent exposure, whereas the base of the G-AF residue forms a stacking interaction with the sugar of the n+1 template base (Fig. 3B). Despite this interaction and the disorder of the O1 helix, the O helix remains ordered and in an open conformation well positioned for transfer of the n template base from the template preinsertion site to the insertion site. The remainder of the polymerase active site is unperturbed by the presence of G-AF at the template preinsertion site (Fig. 3A). Hydrogen bonds between protein residues that read the DNA minor groove (Gln-797 and Arg-615) and the n-1 base pair are retained. Both the primer and template bases adopt conformations identical to those of cognate bases at this site. Consequently, there is no distortion of the DNA duplex region, and positioning of the 3′-hydroxyl and assembly of the catalytic site remain intact. G-AF at the Postinsertion Site—A nucleotide was incorporated opposite G-AF in the BF crystal resulting in the formation of a C:G-AF base pair positioned at the postinsertion site (Fig. 4). The C:G-AF base pair results in significant distortions to all active site regions (postinsertion site, insertion site, template preinsertion site, DNA duplex region) except for the catalytic site (Fig. 4). These distortions are reminiscent of distortions induced when a G:T mismatch occupies the polymerase active site (58Johnson S.J. Beese L.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 803-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). By adopting an anti conformation, G-AF forms Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds with the opposing cytosine as the AF moiety projects into the major groove. This conformation resembles the “external” conformation described in structures of AF in duplex DNA determined by NMR (16Mao B. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). By protruding into the major groove, the AF moiety blocks the next template base, which is observed in a stacking interaction with the fluorene moiety, from occupying the template preinsertion site. A second block to the preinsertion site is presented by the loop between the O and O1 helices. The conformation of this loop is altered because of O and O1 helical distortion that causes Tyr-714 to shift by 2.8 Å from its cognate position. Disruption of interactions between the template and polymerase are also observed at the postinsertion site. Here, the interaction between Gln-797 and the template minor groove is lost. The G-AF is rotated away from the polymerase surface and is displaced by 1.6 Å from its cognate position. Although G-AF induces distortions to the template and its interactions with the polymerase active site, distortions to the primer strand and catalytic site are not observed. The newly incorporated primer base retains the minor groove interaction with Arg-615 and the 3′-OH is not displaced. Coordination of the 3′-OH by Asp-830 remains intact for the next 3′- to 5′-nucleotidyl transfer reaction. Structure Determination of BF Polymerase Complexes containing G-AAF-modified DNA Templates—To obtain structures of the G-AAF adduct placed at the preinsertion and postinsertion sites, experiments analogous to those done to capture G-AF at these sites were performed. The structure of a DNA duplex designed to position G-AAF at the preinsertion site was determined to 2.1 Å resolution. In this complex the protein adopts an open conformation and the DNA duplex region, catalytic site, and postinsertion site appear unperturbed. The preinsertion site, although well ordered, is empty. Instead of binding in the preinsertion site, the G-AAF n template base is positioned over the site and is partially disordered. Attempts to incorporate dCTP opposite G-AAF in the BF crystal resulted in structures that are indistinguishable from the initial complex, suggesting that incorporation did not take place. Anti Conformation of G-AF Promotes Accurate Replication— Structures of G-AF as it undergoes one round of replication reveal that G-AF transitions from a syn conformation at the preinsertion site to an anti conformation at the postinsertion site. In so doing, two important features are observed: 1) ability to form cognate Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds with an opposing cytosine, and 2) protrusion of the AF moiety into the solvent-exposed major groove. These features promote accurate incorporation of dCTP over mutagenic incorporation of other dNTPs opposite G-AF and account for the low frequency of mutations (∼10-3 G→T transversions) observed in vivo (59Lenne-Samuel N. Janel-Bintz R. Kolbanovskiy A. Geacintov N.E. Fuchs R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 60Bichara M. Fuchs R.P.P. J. Mol.

Its transition to anti is severely impaired but not completely prohibited. The conformation of AAF in a DNA duplex determined in the absence of protein by biophysical techniques and NMR reveals a highly disruptive inserted conformation in which the fluorene ring stacks with helix base pairs, thereby displacing the attached guanine and sugar into the minor groove (insertion-denaturation model) (17Daune M.P. Fuchs R.P.P. Leng M. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 1981; 58: 201-210Google Scholar, 20Fuchs R.P. Lefevre J.F. Pouyet J. Daune M.P.

It is unlikely that an inserted conformation of G-AAF would be accommodated by the BF active site in a manner amenable to replication. Correspondingly, the inability to incorporate any dCTP opposite G-AAF in solution and in the crystal reflects the blocking effect of G-AAF on replication by BF and other high-fidelity DNA polymerases. By contrast, bypass polymerases such as Pol V from Escherichia coli appear to be able to efficiently copy G-AAF-containing DNA templates (8Fujii S. Gasser V. Fuchs R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Bypass of G-AAF adducts by several specialized eukaryotic DNA polymerases has also been documented (see review Ref. 61Lehmann A.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Lesion Bypass of G-AF by BF—Despite the bulkiness of G-AF, nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion is observed in solution and in the crystal. Primer extension assays demonstrate that nucleotide incorporation opposite G-AF proceeds, albeit less efficiently than replication of undamaged DNA, and dCTP is strongly preferred over all other dNTPs (Fig. 2A). Structures of G-AF at the pre- and postinsertion sites illustrate how nucleotide incorporation occurs despite distortions induced by G-AF to the template strand and polymerase. Before incorporation of dCTP, G-AF occupies the preinsertion site in a manner similar to an unmodified template base. Although there are localized distortions of the protein in the vicinity of G-AF, the presence of G-AF at the preinsertion site does not affect the catalytic site, the postinsertion site, or the O helix. The presence of an active site that remains largely unperturbed permits nucleotide incorporation opposite G-AF. In pairing with cytosine, G-AF adopts an anti conformation to form cognate Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds as the AF moiety protrudes into the major groove. The AF moiety is accommodated by the polymerase because the major groove is predominantly solvent-exposed, whereas the minor groove interacts extensively with the polymerase. The ability of G-AF to adopt conformations at the preinsertion and insertion sites that do not disrupt assembly of the catalytic site promotes nucleotide incorporation opposite G-AF. Following dCTP incorporation opposite G-AF, the newly formed C:G-AF base pair induces distortions to the polymerase active site that affect subsequent DNA synthesis. The most significant of these distortions are to the preinsertion site that is blocked to the next template base by two structural features: the projection of the fluorene moiety over the preinsertion site and the distorted conformation of the O and O1 helices. Disruption of the preinsertion site is accompanied by disruptions to the minor groove interactions between the template and the polymerase. These interactions are disrupted as a consequence of template distortions that displace the n-1 template base. Similar distortions to the template and preinsertion site are observed when certain DNA mismatches or the non-bulky oxidative DNA lesion 8oxoguanine are bound at the polymerase active site (58Johnson S.J.

These distortions likely account for observed reductions in rates of DNA synthesis past mismatches, 8oxoguanine, and G-AF by BF (62Hsu G.W. Ober M. Carell T. Beese L.S.

Biological Significance of Stalled or Blocked Replication— Structures of G-AF determined during the course of one replication cycle show us that mechanisms of high-fidelity replication can accommodate non-cognate template bases and accurately synthesize DNA despite distortions that cause the polymerase to stall. Accommodation of lesion-induced template distortions by high-fidelity polymerases has also been observed for other types of DNA lesions that are less bulky than G-AF or G-AAF but also impede DNA replication. Structures of 8oxoguanine, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, or abasic lesions bound by T7 DNA polymerase (67Brieba L.G. Eichman B.F. Kokoska R.J. Doublie S. Kunkel T.A. Ellenberger T.

Ober M. Carell T. Beese L.S. Nature. 2004; 431: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) reveal that template distortions induced by these lesions do not necessarily result in distortions to the polymerase active site. However, interactions between the lesioned duplex and the polymerase are lost, thereby impairing lesion bypass and promoting partitioning of the DNA duplex to the exonuclease domain in the case of RB69 (69Freisinger E. Grollman A.P. Miller H. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 70Hogg M. Wallace S.S. Doublie S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Rather than bypass lesions using mechanisms of replication for unmodified DNA, high-fidelity polymerases employ non-templated incorporation of dATP (the “A” rule; Ref. 71Strauss B.S. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) to replicate cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (68Li Y. Dutta S. Doublie S. Bdour H.M. Taylor J.S. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Mol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and alternate modes of base pairing to replicate 8oxoguanine (62Hsu G.W. Ober M. Carell T. Beese L.S.

Although these mechanisms of translesion replication may not be as efficient as replication of undamaged DNA, they demonstrate the ability of high-fidelity polymerases to synthesize DNA despite lesion-induced distortions to the template or polymerase active site. Although bypass of G-AF and other types of DNA lesions is achieved by high-fidelity polymerases, G-AAF blocks DNA replication by these polymerases, induces the SOS response, and requires specialized DNA polymerases for in vivo bypass (72Fuchs R.P.P. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 73Koffel-Schwartz N. Coin F. Veaute X. Fuchs R.P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For replication to occur past G-AAF and other blocking lesions, the replicative polymerase is replaced by a specialized lesion bypass polymerase, most commonly a Y family polymerase (the polymerase switch model) (11Cordonnier A.M. Fuchs R.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Structures of Y family polymerases bound to DNA lesions reveal features that allow replication of lesion-modified DNA bases (77Ling H. Boudsocq F. Plosky B.S. Woodgate R. Yang W. Nature. 2003; 424: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 78Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Mol.

U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2265-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Unlike BF, Y family polymerases do not possess the necessary architecture to form a preinsertion site. Instead, these enzymes have modified O and O1 helices or lack them altogether. Consequently, the DNA template assumes a more linear conformation as it enters the active site rather than adopting the sharp turn observed in the context of BF. Replication of bulky adducts is further facilitated by the relative openness of the Y family polymerase active site, which can accommodate mismatched DNA base pairs and DNA lesions (80Yang W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Such a site is less likely to restrict the conformation of large adducts. The syn conformation, to which G-AAF adducts are restricted, may be accommodated by the active site of the Y family polymerase ι (81Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Taylor J.S. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 928-935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is unique among DNA polymerases in that it preferentially drives the templating base to the syn conformation during replication (82Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 2004; 430: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The structural features that differentiate polymerase ι and other Y polymerases from high-fidelity polymerases indicate how Y polymerases are suited for translesion replication of conformationally restricted bulky adducts in a way high-fidelity polymerases are not.

In human cartilage it covers collagen fibrils, but its putative cellular receptors have been unknown. The reverse transcription-PCR analysis of human fetal tissues suggested that based on their distribution all four collagen receptor integrins, namely α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1, are possible receptors for collagen IX. Furthermore primary chondrocytes and chondrosarcoma cells express the four integrins simultaneously. Chondrosarcoma cells, as well as Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected to express α1β1, α2β1, or α10β1 integrin as their only collagen receptor, showed fast attachment and spreading on human recombinant collagen IX indicating that it is an effective cell adhesion protein. To further study the recognition of collagen IX we produced recombinant αI domains in Escherichia coli. For each of the four αI domains, collagen IX was among the best collagenous ligands, making collagen IX exceptional compared with all other collagen subtypes tested so far. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy images of both α1I- and α2I-collagen IX complexes unveiled only one binding site located in the COL3 domain close to the kink between it and the COL2 domain. The recognition of collagen IX by α2I was considered to represent a novel mechanism for two reasons. First, collagen IX has no GFOGER motif, and the identified binding region lacks any similar sequences. Second, the α2I domain mutations D219R and H258V, which both decreased binding to collagen I and GFOGER, had very different effects on its binding to collagen IX. D219R had no effect, and H258V prevented type IX binding. Thus, our results indicate that collagen IX has unique cell adhesion properties when compared with other collagens, and it provides a novel mechanism for cell adhesion to cartilaginous matrix.

Collagen IX was the first member to be discovered of a subgroup of collagens, now known as the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helix (FACITs) 1The abbreviations used are: FACITs, fibril-associated collagen with interruptions in triple helix; RT, reverse transcription; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; s, sense; as, antisense; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin.1The abbreviations used are: FACITs, fibril-associated collagen with interruptions in triple helix; RT, reverse transcription; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; s, sense; as, antisense; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin.

Collagen IX is composed of three different α chains, termed α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX). Structurally the collagen IX molecule can be divided into three triple helical domains (COL1, COL2, and COL3) separated and flanked by non-triple helical (NC) domains. Collagen IX is expressed in cartilage and in a limited number of other locations, including developing eye. Collagen IX can be covalently cross-linked to collagen II, and typically it covers the large fibrils formed by collagens II and XI (2Eyre D.R. Apon S. Wu J.J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A.

In this report we demonstrate that based on their expression pattern all four collagen receptor integrins are putative receptors for type IX and that they, and their corresponding recombinant αI domains, each bind to human recombinant collagen IX. For every integrin collagen IX was among the best collagenous ligands. This makes collagen IX exceptional among all collagens tested so far and emphasizes the role of FACITs as cell adhesion proteins. Our results indicate that α1I and α2I domains recognize only one site in collagen IX that is in COL3 very close to the kink formed by NC3 domain. The binding mechanism does not resemble any of the previously described I domain-collagen interactions.

Cell cultures were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, ICN Biomedicals Inc., Irvine, CA) for 18 h in methionine-free minimum essential medium (Sigma). Cell monolayers were rinsed on ice with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and then detached by scraping. Cell pellets obtained by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min were solubilized in 200 μl of the same buffer containing 100 mmn-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) on ice with occasional vortexing. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.

Cells were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow for an additional 4-6 h typically at room temperature before harvesting by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) and then lysed by sonication followed by addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 2%.

Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the lysate, which was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation. The lysate was then centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B with bound fusion protein was transferred into disposable chromatography columns (Bio-Rad).

https://openalex.org/W1985561224,"The decision-making mechanisms that determine the choice of the appropriate effector immune response to a microbial challenge are poorly understood. The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), injected intradermally in mice together with a soluble protein and a T helper-2 (Th2) priming Toll-like receptors (TLRs) agonist during primary immunization, shifts the memory response to the Th1 type. This effect can be shown by the enhanced hypersensitivity response and by the Th1 pattern of cytokines production that was abolished by the specific cannabinoid receptor CB2 antagonist SR 144528. 2-AG seems to operate during the innate response by increasing the number of dendritic cells (DCs) migrating to the draining lymph nodes. Expression of CB2 mRNA but not of the protein was higher in immature vs. mature DCs. Consistently, in vitro, 2-AG exerted a potent chemotactic activity on both immature and mature DCs. In conclusion, we suggest that, in vivo, the endocannabinoid 2-AG may act as chemotactic substance capable of recruiting DCs and/or their precursors during the innate immune response that, in presence of a TLR agonist, consequently instruct a Th1-shifted adaptive response. As 2-AG may be induced in tissues by various stimuli at concentrations similar to that used in our study, this evidence might be of a wide-ranging pathophysiological relevance."
https://openalex.org/W1964722330,"Homeostasis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is regulated by the opposing actions between CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) and the group VIA Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2). We investigated this process during the cell cycle. PC mass doubles during late G1 and early S phase when its rate of catabolism is lowest. We show that iPLA2 activity is cell cycle-dependent with peak activity during G2/M and late S phase. iPLA2 activity declines during G1 and is lowest at the G1/S transition and early S phase. The accumulation of PC correlates with decreased iPLA2 activity, suggesting that regulation of this enzyme contributes to phospholipid accumulation. The levels of 80 kDa iPLA2 protein do not change and thus cannot account for changes in enzyme activity. Reverse transcriptase and real-time PCR experiments show that splice variant iPLA2 mRNAs are preferentially expressed during G2/M. Immunoblot analyses with an antibody directed against the N terminus of iPLA2 revealed a ∼50 kDa protein that is of appropriate size to be the truncated protein encoded by the ankyrin-iPLA2-1 splice variant mRNA. The levels of truncated iPLA2 protein were high in cells in late G1 and S phase cells that had low iPLA2 activity and low in G2/M cells that had high iPLA2 activity. The truncated protein co-immunoprecipitated with full-length iPLA2, indicating a physical interaction between the two proteins.

Eukaryotic cell membranes are composed of a complex collection of glycerophospholipids, sphingosylphospholipids, proteins, and cholesterol. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; iPLA2, group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2; cPLA2, group IVA phospholipase A2; PLD, phospholipase D; CT, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cell; asyn, asynchronous; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting.1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; iPLA2, group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2; cPLA2, group IVA phospholipase A2; PLD, phospholipase D; CT, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cell; asyn, asynchronous; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting. is the most abundant membrane glycerophospholipid in mammalian cells and thus serves as an important structural element of cell membranes. In addition to its importance with respect to membrane structure, it also serves as a precursor for the synthesis of sphingomyelin (1Voelker D.R. Kennedy E.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), phosphatidylethanolamine (2Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and a variety of bioactive lipid signaling molecules that regulate cell behavior (3Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Tightly coordinated regulatory mechanisms are necessary to maintain PC homeostasis. Several reports have suggested that in some cell types PC homeostasis is maintained through the opposing actions of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyl-transferase-α (CTα) and the group VIA Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2). CTα, the rate-limiting enzyme in the major pathway for PC synthesis in mammalian cells (4Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), catalyzes the formation of CDP-choline from CTP and phosphocholine. iPLA2 is an sn-2 directed acylhydrolase that catabolizes glycerophospholipid into free fatty acid and 2-lysophospholipid. Overexpression of CTα in COS, CHO-K1, and HeLa cells increased PC synthesis, yet PC mass remained relatively constant because of increased catabolism (5Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C.L. Biochim.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that this enzyme was responsible for maintaining membrane phospholipid mass by modulating the rate of PC catabolism. In addition to its role in maintaining glycerophospholipid homeostasis, iPLA2 is also involved in other cellular processes, including acyl chain remodeling, apoptosis, and eicosanoid production (8Balsinde J.

Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that the catalytic activity of the enzyme is modulated by catalytically inactive truncated iPLA2 proteins that are encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs (12Larsson P.K. Claesson H.E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These splice variants are referred to as ankyrin-iPLA2s because the alternative splicing is predicted to generate truncated proteins that retain the N-terminal ankyrin repeats but lack the C-terminal lipase site. These catalytically inactive proteins are thought to disrupt the oligomerization of full-length monomers and thereby down-regulate the activity of the enzyme.At some point during the cell cycle, the net rate of lipid synthesis must overcome the rate of catabolism to allow for the doubling of lipid mass for daughter cells. This accumulation of PC is essential for cell cycle progression. Decreased PC synthesis and mass occurs when C3H/10T1/2 fibroblasts, W1-38 fibroblasts, and L6 myoblasts are deprived of choline and results in growth arrest during G1 (13Terce F. Brun H. Vance D.E.

More recently, it has been shown that inhibition of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase-1 blocks PC synthesis and induces apoptosis in a variety of cell lines (15Fuentes L. Perez R. Nieto M.L. Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44683-44690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although PC accumulation occurs in G1/S, the rate of PC synthesis and activity of CTα are highest in early G1 (16Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20219-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that PC accumulation during S phase is not solely dependent on increased synthesis. Instead, several reports suggest that a decrease in phospholipid turnover contributes to the net accumulation of PC during late G1 and S phase (13Terce F. Brun H. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tones M.A. Sharif N.A.

J. 1970; 119: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that one or more of the phospholipase activities must be regulated during the cell cycle.Given its other roles in basal phospholipid metabolism, we were intrigued by the possibility that iPLA2 activity might be down-regulated to allow phospholipids to accumulate during S phase. To test this hypothesis, we compared iPLA2 activity and expression in cells at each phase of the cell cycle. We demonstrate that iPLA2 activity is regulated during the cell cycle and that the regulation of iPLA2 activity may account for glycero-phospholipid accumulation during late G1 and early S phase. Our studies also indicate that the mechanism of this regulation is dependent on alternative splicing of the iPLA2 gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—CHO-K1 and Jurkat T cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Hydroxyurea and choline chloride were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Thymidine, bovine pancreas ribonuclease A, nocodazole, and propidium iodide were all obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). 1-Palmitoyl-2-[14C]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, [3H]oleic acid, and [3H]choline chloride were purchased from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). Unlabeled lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). A rabbit polyclonal anti-iPLA2 antibody was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Another anti-iPLA2 antibody (P-19) that recognizes an undisclosed epitope within the first 100 amino acids and the corresponding blocking peptide were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-iPLA2 used for immunoprecipitation (T-14) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Silica plates and silica gel were obtained from Analtech (Newark, DE). The ankyrin-iPLA2-1 cDNA was a kind gift of Dr. Brian Kennedy (Merck Frosst Canada & Co.).Cell Culture and Synchronization—CHO-K1 and Jurkat T cells were cultured in Ham's F-12K and RPMI media, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cell viability was determined using Trypan blue and exceeded 90% in all experiments. For CHO-K1 synchronization, subconfluent cells were treated with 5 mm thymidine for 24 h. Cells were then released from this block and cultured with fresh medium for 8 h under normal culture conditions. Nocodazole was then added to a final concentration of 0.04 μg/ml for 6 h. A mitotic shake-off was then performed to isolate cells synchronized in G2/M (20Zieve G.W. Turnbull D. Mullins J.M. McIntosh J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 126: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These isolated cells were then plated in fresh medium and allowed to progress through the cell cycle. For Jurkat T cell synchronization, cell cycle arrest was achieved exactly as described by Marshall and co-workers (21Roshak A.K. Capper E.A. Stevenson C. Eichman C. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35692-35698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Flow Cytometric Cell Cycle Analysis—An equal number of cells from each sample were fixed with 70% ethanol. The samples were then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The 70% ethanol was removed, and the cells were then treated with 100 μl of RNase A (62 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cell samples were then stained with 100 μg/ml of propidium iodide. The samples were then analyzed on a BD Biosciences flow cytometer to obtain DNA content profiles. The histograms were analyzed using the ModFitLT cell cycle analysis software from Verity INC.Immunoblot Analysis—Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% Tris-glycine gels). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto supported nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and the blots were then incubated in primary antisera for 6 h (Cayman antibody) or overnight (Santa Cruz antibody) at 4 °C. The blots were washed three times with TBS and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 1 h. The blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and the chemiluminescent signals were captured on x-ray film.Immunoprecipitation of iPLA2—Jurkat T cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in assay homogenization buffer. The cells were then sonicated and centrifuged at 400 × g to remove unbroken cells and debris. Cell lysates were precleared with protein Gagarose (50% slurry from Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were then incubated with the T-14 goat-polyclonal anti-iPLA2 for 2 h at 4 °C with rocking. Protein G-agarose was then added to the solution for 2 h at 4 °C with rocking. The precipitates were washed twice in ice-cold assay homogenization buffer and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for iPLA2 proteins by immunoblot.Phospholipase A2 Activity Assays—PLA2 activity was assayed using well established methods (5Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell homogenates were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.34 m sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (assay homogenization buffer), and were lysed by sonication. For iPLA2, the substrate consisted of 100 micromolar dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 400 micromolar Triton X-100, with 0.02 μCi of l-α-dipalmitoyl[2-palmitoyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine added as a tracer. For cPLA2, the substrate consisted of 2 μm l-α-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl[arachidonyl-1-14C]phosphatidylcholine, 1 micromolar dioleoylglycerol. Assays were processed and the released [14C]palmitic acid or [14C]arachidonic acid was quantified according to the method of Dole (23Dole V.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1956; 35: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The assays were performed under conditions where substrate hydrolysis was linear with respect to protein and time.Phospholipase D Activity Assay—Phospholipase D activity was assayed by measuring phosphatidylethanol formation (transphosphatidylation). CHO-K1 cells were labeled for 24 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]oleic acid. During the last hour of incubation, 1% ethanol was added to the culture medium. After harvesting the cells, the phospholipids were extracted according to the Bligh and Dyer method (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and radiolabeled phospholipids were quantified following fractionation by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel G developed with ethyl acetate/isooctane/acetic acid/water (110:50:20:100 v/v, upper phase) (analysis of phosphatidylethanol) or chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (65: 25:5) (analysis of PC). Lipids were visualized using iodine vapors and subsequently scraped for analysis based on co-migration with known standards. The radiolabel associated with phosphatidylethanol and PC was quantified and % transphosphatidylation was calculated (ratio of dpm in phosphatidylethanol/dpm in PC).Quantification of PC Mass—Equal numbers of CHO-K1 cells were homogenized in assay homogenization buffer. Lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and the individual phospholipid species were fractionated by TLC as described above. The PC fraction was identified based on its comigration with known standards and was scraped from the silica plate. PC mass was determined based on lipid phosphorus which was measured with a standard method (25Kates M Techniques in Lipidology. Elsevier Science B. V., 1986: 114-115Google Scholar). The data are reported as micrograms lipid phosphorous per 2.5 million cells.Quantification of PC Synthesis—Synchronized CHO-K1 cells were pulsed with 2 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline chloride for 15 min during various phases of the cell cycle. After labeling, the cells were washed three times and lipids were extracted with the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). PC was separated by TLC on silica plates, the PC spot was identified by co-migration with a known standard, and the associated radiolabel was quantified by scintillation counting. The raw data were corrected for the extraction and counting efficiencies and were normalized for the total amount of [methyl-3H]choline incorporated during the 15 min labeling period. Thus the data are presented as dpm PC/dpm choline.CT Activity Assays—CT activity was measured in whole cell lysates prepared from synchronized CHO-K1 cells. Cell homogenates were prepared, and CT activity was quantified by measuring the conversion of [methyl-14C]phosphorylcholine to [14C]CDP choline, as we have described previously (5Barbour S.E. Kapur A. Deal C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The substrate and product were separated by TLC on silica plates with methanol, 0.5% sodium chloride, ammonium hydroxide (50:50:1) as the mobile phase. The phosphorylcholine and CDP-choline bands were identified based on co-migration with standards, and the radiolabel associated with each band was quantified by scintillation counting. The assays were performed under conditions where conversion of substrate to product was linear with respect to protein and time. This assay does not distinguish between the activities of CTα and CTβ.Quantification of PC Turnover—CHO-K1 cells were metabolically labeled with 1.5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline chloride for 60 h prior to a chase with 100 mm unlabeled choline. For G2/M and G1 PC turnover measurements, synchronization was initiated as described earlier 22 h after the addition of [3H]choline. The G2/M cells were maintained in nocodazole during the chase period in order to prevent cell division and the radiolabel associated with PC was measured at 0, 30, 60, and 90 min after the addition of excess choline. For G1 cells, the chase period began 2 h after release from nocodazole and the radiolabel associated with PC was measured at 0, 1, 2, and 3 h after the addition of excess choline. These time points are within G1 in our model system. For G1/S turnover measurements, CHO-K1 cells were synchronized using 5 mm hydroxyurea for 12 h prior to the chase period and the radiolabel associated with PC was measured at 0, 1.5, and 2.5 h after the addition of excess choline. The cells were maintained in hydroxyurea during the chase period in order to prevent cell cycle progression. At each time point, phospholipids were extracted, and PC was separated and identified. Associated radiolabel was quantified as described above. The raw data were corrected for the extraction and counting efficiencies and were normalized for cell protein. The half-life of the radiolabeled PC was estimated from the slopes of plots of the natural log of the fraction of PC remaining versus time.RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcriptase PCR, and Real-time PCR— Jurkat T cells at different stages of the cell cycle were collected and total mRNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 800 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and subjected to 30 cycles of PCR amplification (95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min). The iPLA2-specific primers used were 5′-cagggctctgcagcgccacatcat-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggccctctcgatggcgatgaggag-3′ (reverse) and they generated 237, 290, and 342 base pair products as expected based on Larsson et al. (12Larsson P.K. Claesson H.E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to determine the levels of iPLA2 and ankyrin-iPLA2 transcripts. The probe and primers used to detect full-length iPLA2 mRNA were 5′-acgagaagcggacccacgaccac-3′ (Taqman probe), 5′-cgttcatcctgggctccat-3′ (forward), 5′-tgaggagctggatgatgag-3′ (reverse). These reagents are designed to amplify a product that contains the border between exon 10 and exon 11. The probe and primers used for detection of the ankyrin-iPLA2 mRNA transcripts were 5′-catgcagaacctgagcccctgagag-3′ (Taqman probe), 5′-gctccatgagggacgagaag-3′ (forward), 5′-tccgtgtgaccttgagcaa-3′ (reverse). These reagents are designed to amplify a product that contains the border between exon 10 and exon 10a. The probes and primers were designed using the Primer Express™ 1.5version. The Taqman probe was labeled in the 5′-end with FAM (fluoresceine) and in the 3′-end with TAMRA. The experiments were performed with the ABI Prism®7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using the TaqMan® One Step PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit. All samples were tested in triplicate under the conditions recommended by the fabricant. The CT threshold was determined to provide the optimal standard curve values. The signal for iPLA2 mRNA expression was normalized to 18 S RNA expression (Pre-developed TaqMan®Assay Reagents).Cloning and Overexpression of Hamster iPLA2—Total RNA was extracted from CHO-K1 cells using TRIzol reagent. cDNAs were synthesized and amplified using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) and PfuUltra polymerase (Stratagene). The full-length hamster iPLA2 was amplified utilizing PCR primers that incorporated 5′-NheI and 3′-ClaI restriction sites (5′-actgctgctagcatgcagttcttcggacgcc-3′ and 5′-gatactatcgattcagggcgacagcagcatt-3′. Hamster iPLA2 was then cloned into the pTRE2Hyg inducible expression vector (BD Clontech) for mammalian expression studies and iPLA2 cDNA sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The iPLA2 vector was then transfected into CHO tet-on cells (BD Clontech) using Lipofectin, according to the manufacturer's instructions. iPLA2 expression was induced by culturing the transfected cells overnight in culture medium containing 500 ng/ml doxycycline.Statistical Analyses—For most experiments, the means ± S.E. of a minimum of three determinations are shown. Data were analyzed with Student's t test with p < 0.05 used as the cut-off for statistical significance.RESULTSTo understand the process of net phospholipid accumulation during the cell cycle and determine if iPLA2 contributes to this process, CHO-K1 fibroblasts were synchronized in G2/M using thymidine and nocodazole (20Zieve G.W. Turnbull D. Mullins J.M. McIntosh J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 126: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). A mitotic shake off was performed, and the synchronized cells were then re-plated and allowed to progress through the cell cycle under normal culture conditions. Propidium iodide staining and flow cytometric analyses were performed to monitor the progression of the cells through the cell cycle (Fig. 1). An asynchronous (asyn) population of cells was used as a comparative control (Fig. 1A). Immediately after release from the mitotic block, over 90% of the cells were in G2/M (Fig. 1B). Cell division was complete within ∼45 min after the nocodazole was washed from the cells. The cells were determined to be in G1 from 1 to 7 h after release from nocodazole (Fig. 1, C and D). The histograms in Fig. 1, E and F indicate that S phase begins at 8 h and lasts through 10 h after the release from nocodazole. Beyond 10 h of incubation, the cells were no longer highly synchronized (data not shown). Thus, this method allowed study of CHO-K1 cells in G2/M, throughout G1, and in S phase.CHO cells synchronized in G2/M contained 1.72 ± 0.12 μg of lipid phosphate per 2.5 million cells (Fig. 2A). Immediately after cell division PC mass was reduced by ∼50%, consistent with partitioning of lipid to the membranes of daughter cells. PC mass increased during G1 and reached G2/M levels by early S phase. These results demonstrate that PC mass accumulates before cell division and are consistent with previous reports (16Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Golfman L.S. Bakovic M. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

CHO-K1 cells were synchronized in G2/M using thymidine and nocodazole and then released from this block. A, PC mass during the cell cycle. PC was extracted from equal numbers of cells and purified by thin-layer chromatography and PC mass was quantified based on the lipid phosphorous present in the PC fraction. A representative experiment is shown (n = 3), and the data are presented as micrograms lipid phosphorous/2.5 million cells. B, PC half-life during the cell cycle. Synchronized CHO-K1 cells were labeled with [3H]choline for 60 h and then chased with excess unlabeled choline as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The half-life of PC was quantified for cells in G2/M, G1, and G1/S. Data represent the mean ± S.D. for three independent experiments. ** indicates p < 0.05 versus G2/M sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As several reports have attributed glycerophospholipid accumulation to decreased turnover (16Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tones M.A. Sharif N.A. Hawthorne J.N. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we measured the half-life of PC to determine if this was true in the CHO cell system as well. To achieve this, CHO cells were labeled to equilibrium with [3H]choline, arrested at various points in the cell cycle, and then subjected to a chase with excess unlabeled choline. The thymidine and nocodazole synchronization method described for PC mass analysis was used to generate cells in G2/M or mid-G1. However due to the complications associated with maintaining cells at the border of G1 and S phase during the long choline chase period, we used 5 mm hydroxyurea for 12 h to achieve synchronization in G1/S. This method successfully synchronized these cells in G1/S as determined by FACS analysis of DNA content (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, the half-life of PC was ∼3-fold longer during G1/S than it was during G2/M and the G1 half-life was between these two values but this difference was not statistically significant. Thus, the rate of PC turnover is highest during G2/M and lowest at the G1/S boundary. The decline in PC turnover at the G1/S boundary is consistent with previous reports and indicates that this allows for net PC accumulation before cell division.It is well established that PC accumulation during the cell cycle does not correlate with the kinetics of its synthesis (16Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Golfman L.S. Bakovic M. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 26: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We obtained similar results in the CHO cell system as the cells exhibited a burst of PC synthesis but this occurred in early G1 and not during late G1 and S phase when PC mass accumulated (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the catalytic activity of CT, the rate-limiting enzyme in PC synthesis, was relatively static throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results suggest that net accumulation of PC during the cell cycle is not strictly dependent on its rate of synthesis but is large"

We have located the binding site for a K+ ion in the P-domain by means of x-ray crystallography using crystals prepared in the presence of the K+ congener Rb+.

Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) that actively transports Ca2+ against a large concentration gradient, fuelled by energy derived from ATP. In addition to the primary substrates, Mg:ATP and Ca2+, monovalent alkali metal ions like K+ and Na+ (but with the exception of Li+) also influence the enzymatic cycle of the Ca2+-ATPase (2Shigekawa M. Pearl L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6947-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular functional importance is the K+-induced acceleration of dephosphorylation of the ADP-insensitive E2P phosphoenzyme intermediate (2Shigekawa M. Pearl L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6947-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Andersen J.P. Lassen K. Møller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, addition of K+ at the concentration found in the cytoplasm was found to increase the rate of dephosphorylation more than 10-fold relative to the situation without added monovalent cation (3Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that K+ modulates step(s) involved in Ca2+ binding to the dephosphoenzyme (5De Meis L. Hasselbach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4759-4763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Champeil P. Henao F. de Foresta B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12383-12393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Lee A.G.

Despite the fact that the dependence of Ca2+-ATPase function on alkali metal ions was discovered more than 25 years ago, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) and the binding site(s) involved have not been determined, but as far as dephosphorylation is concerned kinetic evidence suggests that K+ is bound with high affinity in a 1:1 complex and from the cytosolic side (8Shigekawa M.

Atomic structures of four different states of the Ca2+-ATPase, obtained by x-ray crystallography, are now available (10Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 11Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase consists of three distinct cytoplasmic domains named A (“actuator”), P (“phosphorylation”), and N (“nucleotide binding”), as well as a Ca2+-binding transmembrane sector comprised by ten mostly helical segments, M1 through M10. With the aim of identifying binding sites for K+ we have taken advantage of the fact that this cation can be exchanged by the congener Rb+, thereby allowing for the identification of K+/Rb+-binding sites by difference Fourier techniques. This approach was successfully used before to elucidate the potassium ion-binding sites of for example the potassium channel (12Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5767) Google Scholar) and the 50 S ribosomal subunit (13Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 920-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a K+/Rb+-binding site present at Glu732 in the crystal structure of the Ca2+-ATPase with bound Ca2+, ADP, and AlF–4 (11Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and we provide evidence by analysis of mutant enzyme that this site is functionally important in connection with K+ modulation of the dephosphorylation rate. For crystallization, Ca2+-ATPase isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle was purified by extraction with a low concentration of deoxycholate according to established procedures (4Andersen J.P. Lassen K. Møller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Large, single crystals grew over a few days and were mounted from mother liquor in nylon loops and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of cDNA encoding rabbit SERCA1a, expression in COS-1 cells, and functional analysis of the overall and partial reactions of expressed enzyme were carried out as described previously (15Sørensen T.L.

Structural Analysis—Crystals of the Ca2+-ATPase in the Ca2E1-ADP:AlF–4 form grown in the presence of either 80 mm KCl or 80 mm RbCl belong to the same crystal form. The structure of the Ca2E1-AMPPCP form refined at 2.6-Å resolution was used as the starting model for structure determination and refinement of the Ca2E1−ADP:AlF4−(KCL) form at 2.9-Å resolution as described previously (11Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Crystals grown in the presence of Rb+ diffracted to 3.3-Å resolution, and data were collected using synchrotron radiation with a wavelength of 0.81 Å where a significant anomalous signal of rubidium is present (f″ = 3.5 e) (Table I). CNS was used to generate an anomalous difference Fourier map (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

A single positive peak at 7.1 σ (background maximum of 4.5 σ) was identified at a site displaying the structure of a typical cation-binding site as defined by interactions with several carbonyl and carboxylate oxygens (Fig. 1A). Similarly, a Fo(RbCl) – Fo(KCl) difference Fourier map showed a positive peak at 7.2 σ in the same site (Fig. 1A). The site was therefore assigned as a K+ site in the native enzyme.Table ISummary of crystallographic parametersFormCa2E1-ADP:AlF4−(RbCl)Space GroupC2Cell dimensionsa = 162.1, b = 75.1, c = 150.0, β = 109.3°Wavelength (Å)0.8116Resolution40-3.3 (3.42-3.3)RsymaRsym = ΣhΣi|Ii(h) — 〈I(h)〉|/ΣhΣiIi(h), Ii(h) is the ith measurement.0.099 (0.42)I/σI11.1 (2.1)RisobRiso is calculated like Rsym upon scaling the data set to the Ca2E1-ADP:AlF4−(KCL) form.9.8%Redundancy2.8 (2.4)Completeness (%)cAnomalous data.91.4 (61.0)a Rsym = ΣhΣi|Ii(h) — 〈I(h)〉|/ΣhΣiIi(h), Ii(h) is the ith measurement.b Riso is calculated like Rsym upon scaling the data set to the Ca2E1-ADP:AlF4−(KCL) form.c Anomalous data. Open table in a new tab Description of the Identified Rb+/K+Site—Fig. 1B shows the overall structure of the Ca2+-ATPase in the E1-ADP:AlF–4 conformation with the K+ site located between the two C-terminal helices of the P-domain, over the M3 and M5 segments. This localization in the cytoplasmic domain is in agreement with biochemical data demonstrating that K+ exerts its effect on the function of the Ca2+-ATPase when present on the cytoplasmic side (8Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11679-11687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the electron density maps of the Ca2+-ATPase with bound AMPPCP or ADP:AlF–4 we had previously identified additional density at this position that could not originate from the atoms of the enzyme. Also, the density could not be accounted for by a water molecule since this led to unrealistic low B-factors compared with the B-factors of surrounding protein atoms and an impossible hydrogen bonding network. On the other hand, placing a potassium ion at the site provided a sensible chemical model which was substantiated by further refinement at 2.6-Å resolution of the Ca2E1-AMPPCP form, in agreement with the finding with rubidium. This leads to the conclusion that K+ is coordinated with carbonyl oxygens from residues 711, 712, and 714 together with one side chain oxygen of Glu732, thereby providing a total of four of the six ligands required for an octahedral coordination of the potassium ion. Moreover, the observed site is surface-located, resulting in the potassium ion being exposed (Fig. 1B), thereby allowing solvent molecules to fulfil the coordination. ANa+ to (Rb+ or K+) ratio of 2.5:1 was present at the given experimental conditions and a partial occupancy by Na+ in the crystals cannot be excluded, since Na+ also stimulates dephosphorylation, although with a somewhat lower affinity than K+ (2Shigekawa M. Pearl L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6947-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Toyoshima and co-workers (10Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 18Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) place a Na+ ion at the same site in their refined structures of the Ca2E1 and Ca2E1-AMPPCP forms obtained in the absence of K+. However, at typical physiological conditions with a very high K+ to Na+ ratio the site is most likely occupied by K+. We have also identified density corresponding to this K+ site in preliminary maps of the Ca2+-ATPase in the E2-thapsigary and Ca2E1 conformations. 2A.-M. L. Jensen, T. L.-M. Sørensen, J. V. Møller, and P. Nissen, unpublished data. This supports our finding based on the Ca2E1−ADP:AlF4− form and suggests that this is an integral potassium-binding site of SERCA that remains occupied throughout the enzyme cycle. Mutagenesis Analysis of the Importance of Glu732 in K+Modulation of Function—To test the functional importance of the K+ site described above, Glu732 was replaced by either alanine or glutamine, and the mutant and wild-type enzymes, expressed in COS-1 cell endoplasmic reticulum membranes, were compared with respect to K+ modulation of function. Table II, left part, shows the steady-state turnover rates for ATP hydrolysis determined at 37 °C in the presence of optimal concentrations of Ca2+ and ATP, with and without K+ added. It is seen that the addition of 100 mm K+ induced a ∼2-fold increase of the turnover rate for wild-type enzyme, whereas mutant Glu732 → Ala showed close to maximum activity already in the absence of K+ with little further activation occurring upon the addition of K+. Mutant Glu732 → Gln, on the other hand, behaved much like wild type, with K+ inducing a ∼2-fold activation.Table IISummary of the functional analysis of Glu732 mutantsMutantATPase turnover rateaThe maximum rate of Ca2+-activated ATP hydrolysis was determined at 37 °C in a medium containing 50 mm TES/Tris (pH 7.0), 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.9 mm CaCl2 (giving a free Ca2+ concentration of 3 μm), 5 mm ATP, 1 μm Ca2+ ionophore A23187, with or without 100 mm KCl as indicated.

The ATPase turnover rate was calculated as the amount of Pi liberated per Ca2+-ATPase molecule per second.b Rate of dephosphorylation of E2P corresponding to Fig. 2. Open table in a new tab The hydrolysis of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate, E2P, is one of the partial reaction steps contributing to rate limitation of the enzyme cycle under the experimental conditions used for measurement of ATPase activity described above, particularly in the absence of K+ (19Champeil P. le Maire M. Andersen J.P. Guillain F. Gingold M. Lund S. Møller J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16372-16384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This step was examined separately by determining the dephosphorylation rate following phosphorylation of the enzyme with 32Pi (Fig. 2 and Table II, right part). The addition of 100 mm K+ increased the dephosphorylation rate by a factor of 14 in wild type and by a factor of 11 in mutant Glu732 → Gln, whereas for Glu732 → Ala, the dephosphorylation rate was activated only 2.6-fold, thus indicating a very significant reduction of the sensitivity to K+. In the absence of K+, the dephosphorylation rate of Glu732 → Ala was 1.5-fold higher than that corresponding to wild type, in line with the finding of higher ATPase activity, relative to wild type, in the absence of K+. From these data it is clear that Glu732 is important for the modulation of E2P dephosphorylation by K+ and that this function is disrupted by removal of both side chain oxygen atoms of Glu732 (in Glu732 → Ala) but not by the selective removal of only one of them (in Glu732 → Gln), thus indicating that Glu732 donates one of its side chain oxygen atoms, but not necessarily both, to K+ binding. This notion correlates well with the crystal structure, as shown in Fig. 1A. It is also clear that the mutation to alanine relieves an inhibition existing when the side chain oxygen is not coordinated by K+. The Glu732 → Ala mutation will destabilize the K+ site substantially, yet a residual stimulatory effect of K+ was still observed in this mutant, which may be ascribed to low affinity binding in the identified site. Proposed Mechanism of K+Modulation of Dephosphorylation—Evidence has accumulated that dephosphorylation requires that domain A is rotated relative to its position in E1 and E1P forms. Upon dissociation of ADP the highly conserved TGES motif of domain A is inserted into the catalytic site of domain P, with the glutamate of TGES participating in the hydrolysis of the aspartyl phosphoryl bond as catalytic residue in the E2P form (10Toyoshima C. Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 269-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 20Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 43971-43981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of E2P has previously been found to be sensitive to amino acid substitutions or proteolytic cleavage in the linker segments connecting either domain A or domain P with the transmembrane segments M2, M3, and M5 (15Sørensen T.L. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28954-28961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Clausen J.D. Andersen J.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38647-38659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Hence, the linker segments appear to hold domain A and domain P in the optimal positions for catalysis of dephosphorylation. We believe that the importance of the identified K+ site should be seen in this context. Interestingly, the crystal structure of the thapsigargin-bound E2 dephosphoenzyme form (24Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) shows that the A-M3 linker is within a 5-Å distance of the K+-binding site identified here, and the models for the structure of the vanadate-bound E2 form suggested on the basis of analysis of two-dimensional membrane crystals (25Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar, 26Xu C. Rice W.J. He W. Stokes D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) also indicate that these sites come close together. Hence they might interact directly in the E2P state (23Møller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38647-38659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the K+ ion could, thus, play a role as a “cross-linker” that stabilizes the interaction between the lower part of domain P and the A-M3 linker. Indeed, it should be possible for the K+ ion with free, solvent-exposed ligand-binding sites to coordinate incoming oxygen atoms from residues of the A-M3 linker. Which advantages would the K+ ion offer as such an interdomain cross-linker, compared with, for example, a salt bridge? First of all, the interaction must conform to the coordination of the K+ ion, and it will therefore be sensitive to conformational changes. This may serve as a regulatory switch in the E2P to E2 transition, where a close yet transient interaction between the P-domain and the A-M3 linker may stimulate the dephosphorylation reaction. In support of this view, Na+ and Rb+ display coordination chemistries similar to K+ and are also observed to have a stimulatory effect on the dephophorylation rate, whereas the chemically far more distinct Li+ does not. Is the K+Site Conserved in the P-type ATPase Family?—The alignment in Fig. 1c shows that the Glu732 residue is highly conserved as either Glu or Asp. The residues making up the 710–715 loop are only partly conserved, but since only the backbone carbonyls are contributing to the binding site this is not surprising. More importantly Pro709 is highly conserved and is likely to be essential for the formation of the loop by discontinuing the preceding helix. Taken together, this suggests that the site may be a general feature of P-type ATPases. A stimulatory effect of K+ has also been found in the plant H+-ATPase (27Vara F. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12826-12830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the possible functional role of the site in this pump, as well. For Na+,K+- and H+,K+-ATPases, K+ is a direct substrate for intramembraneous cation-binding sites, which then either activates or inhibits the pump (when binding from the extracellular or cytoplasmic side, respectively). An additional, modulatory effect of the cytoplasmic K+ site described here may therefore be obscured in most functional studies of Na+,K+- and H+,K+-ATPases, and the importance of a possible, modulatory effect of K+ on these pumps may need to be addressed by renewed interpretation and acquisition of experimental data similar to those described here for the Ca2+-ATPase."

We have studied the modes of action of the macrolides josamycin, with a 16-membered lactone ring, and erythromycin, with a 14-membered lactone ring, in a cell-free mRNA translation system with pure components from Escherichia coli. We have found that the average lifetime on the ribosome is 3 h for josamycin and less than 2 min for erythromycin and that the dissociation constants for josamycin and erythromycin binding to the ribosome are 5.5 and 11 nm, respectively. Josamycin slows down formation of the first peptide bond of a nascent peptide in an amino acid-dependent way and completely inhibits formation of the second or third peptide bond, depending on peptide sequence. Erythromycin allows formation of longer peptide chains before the onset of inhibition. Both drugs stimulate the rate constants for drop-off of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome. In the josamycin case, drop-off is much faster than drug dissociation, whereas these rate constants are comparable in the erythromycin case. Therefore, at a saturating drug concentration, synthesis of full-length proteins is completely shut down by josamycin but not by erythromycin. It is likely that the bacterio-toxic effects of the drugs are caused by a combination of inhibition of protein elongation, on the one hand, and depletion of the intracellular pools of aminoacyl-tRNAs available for protein synthesis by drop-off and incomplete peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity, on the other hand.

Macrolides form a large group of antibiotics that target the protein synthesis machinery (1Vázquez D. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 30: 169-175Google Scholar, 2Walsh C. Antibiotics: Actions, Origins, Resistance. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2003: 57-63Google Scholar). All macrolides contain a 14-, 15-, or 16-membered lactone ring with sugar residues (2Walsh C. Antibiotics: Actions, Origins, Resistance. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2003: 57-63Google Scholar). This study concerns the action of two members of the macrolide family, erythromycin and josamycin. Erythromycin, a frequently used drug in the clinic (2Walsh C. Antibiotics: Actions, Origins, Resistance. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2003: 57-63Google Scholar), contains a 14-membered lactone ring, whereas josamycin contains a 16-membered lactone ring (Fig. 1A). The molecular mechanism of macrolide action has remained puzzling during decades of scientific studies. All macrolides bind competitively to a site in the vicinity of the peptidyltransferase center (3Di Giambattista M. Engelborghs Y. Nyssen E. Cocito C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8591-8597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but direct inhibition of the peptidyltransferase reaction has been observed only for macrolides with 16-membered lactone rings (4Poulsen S.M. Kofoed C. Vester B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Mao J.C. Robishaw E.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2054-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Erythromycin, in contrast, allows synthesis of short peptides before nascent protein elongation is inhibited (5Mao J.C. Robishaw E.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2054-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Macrolides also induce drop-off of peptidyl-tRNAs from translating ribosomes both in vitro (6Otaka T. Kaji A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2649-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Tenson T. Lovmar M. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol.

Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The macrolide induced drop-off events may be toxic for bacterial cells because accumulation of peptidyl-tRNA in the cell depletes pools of free tRNA isoacceptors (9Heurgue-Hamard V. Mora L.

Biol. 2003; 330 (and references therein): 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), these structures have clarified some aspects of macrolide action. The crystal structures show that all macrolides bind to the beginning of the nascent peptide exit tunnel, with their C-5 sugars extending toward the peptidyltransferase center (Fig. 1). The biochemical data suggest a common mechanism for macrolide action, based on the space that is available between the peptidyltransferase center and the ribosome bound macrolide (7Tenson T. Lovmar M. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330 (and references therein): 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). At the same time, several questions have remained unanswered. (i) Are the rate constants for peptidyl-tRNA drop-off enhanced by macrolides, or are these events an indirect consequence of the inhibition of the peptidyltransferase reaction by the drugs? (ii) At which step in the elongation cycle does peptidyl-tRNA drop-off occur? (iii) Do macrolides inhibit translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from the A to P site? (iv) Can protein synthesis be resumed by the dissociation of a macrolide that has caused ribosomal stalling? (v) Are the growth inhibitory effects of macrolides because of direct inhibition of protein elongation on the ribosome, or are they an indirect effect of depletion of tRNA pools because of frequent drop-off events and insufficient intracellular peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity? In this study we have clarified some of these issues for the macrolides erythromycin and josamycin by studying their kinetic properties in a cell-free system for protein synthesis with Escherichia coli components of high purity (7Tenson T.

All experiments were performed in polymix buffer at 37 °C using equal volumes of preinitiated ribosomes and pre-formed ternary complexes containing EF-Tu, 1The abbreviations used are: EF, elongation factor; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography; PT, peptidyltransferase. GTP, and aminoacyl-tRNA. The reactions were quenched by adding 10 volumes of 15% formic acid to 1 volume of reaction mixture, and the peptides were analyzed as described previously (7Tenson T. Lovmar M. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330 (and references therein): 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The initiation mixture, containing ribosomes (1.6 μm, ∼50% active in peptidyl transfer), [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet (2 μm), mRNA 3.2 μm, IF2 (0,3 μm), IF1 (0.6 μm) and IF3 (0.6 μm), was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C to allow for formation of initiated ribosome complexes. The elongation mixture, containing EF-G (1.6 μm), EF-Tu (24 μm), EF-Ts (0.24 μm), and tRNAbulk (∼0.18 mm), the relevant aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (0.1 units/μl) (defined in Ref. 21Ehrenberg M. Bilgin N. Kurland C.G. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 101-129Google Scholar), peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (1.12 μm), and amino acids (160 μm each), was preincubated for 8 min at 37 °C to allow for formation of ternary complexes. In addition, both mixtures contained ATP (1 mm), GTP (1 mm), phosphoenolpyruvate (10 mm), myokinase (3 μg/ml), and pyruvate kinase (50 μg/ml). Kinetic Experiments with Quench-flow Techniques—Preinitiated ribosomes, formed in the absence or presence of josamycin, were rapidly mixed with the elongation mixture in a quench-flow instrument (KinTek Corp.), and the reaction was quenched with formic acid after different incubation times. The composition of peptides was determined by RP-HPLC, as described in Ref. 7Tenson T. Lovmar M. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330 (and references therein): 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar. Association Rate Constant for Josamycin—Josamycin at different concentrations (2, 3, 4, and 6 μm) was added to preinitiated ribosomes to start the incubation. One volume of elongation mix was added to 1 volume of reaction mix at each incubation time, and after 10 s the reaction was quenched with formic acid. The association rates were estimated from the fraction of tri-peptide-forming ribosomes. Ratio between the Association Rate Constants for Erythromycin and Josamycin—An experiment, where josamycin and erythromycin competed for ribosome binding, was carried out by adding mixtures of josamycin and erythromycin to preinitiated ribosomal complexes. The josamycin concentration was 100 μm and the erythromycin concentration was varied between 0.5 and 16 μm. After 20 s of incubation, 1 volume of elongation mix was added to 1 volume of reaction mix, and the reaction was quenched by formic acid after 10 s. The extent of tri-peptide formation was analyzed as in the previous case. Macrolide Dissociation Rate Constants from Chase Experiments—To determine the dissociation rate constants for josamycin and erythromycin, in a first experiment initiated ribosome complexes were formed in the presence of 4 μm josamycin during 10 min. Then 300 μm erythromycin was added to start the chase. At varying incubation times, 1 volume of elongation mixture was added to 1 volume of reaction mixture. The reaction was quenched with formic acid after 10 s, and the amount of tri-peptide formed was analyzed by RP-HPLC as in the previous experiments. The fraction of ribosomes competent in tri-peptide formation increased with a rate determined by the first order compounded rate constant kobs1. In a second experiment, the initiated ribosome complexes were formed with 4 μm erythromycin by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C. Then 250 μm josamycin was added to start the chase. The reaction was stopped, and the extent of tri-peptide formation was analyzed as described above. The fraction of ribosomes competent in tri-peptide formation decayed with a rate determined by the compounded rate constant kobs2. Together with the association rate constants for josamycin (ka,J) and erythromycin (ka,E), the estimates of kobs1 and kobs2 were used to estimate the dissociation rate constants for josamycin (kd,J) and erythromycin (kd,E), as described below. Peptidyl-tRNA Drop-off—Preinitiated ribosome complexes were mixed with translation factors including peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. The reaction was quenched with formic acid after varying incubation times, and the amounts of peptides on the ribosome (pellet) and peptides originating from drop-off events (supernatant) were analyzed by RP-HPLC as described previously (7Tenson T. Lovmar M. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330 (and references therein): 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Translation and Drop-off Model—To estimate the compounded rate constants k1–k5 in Fig. 4 from the translation and drop-off experiments, we described the model with ordinary differential Equations 1–5, dc1(t)/dt=−k1⋅c1(t)dc2(t)/dt=k1⋅c1(t)−(k2+k4)⋅c2(t)c1(0)=1dc3(t)/dt=k2⋅c2(t)−(k3+k5)⋅c3(t)c2(0)=c3(0)=c4(0)=c5(0)=0dc4(t)/dt=k3⋅c3(t)dc5(t)/dt=k4⋅c2(t)+k5⋅c3(t)Equations 1–5 where c1 is the concentration of initiation complex normalized to the concentration of active ribosomes; c2 and c3 are the normalized concentrations of di-peptide complexes before and after translocation, respectively. c4 is the normalized concentration of tri-peptide complex, and c5 is the normalized concentration of peptidyl-tRNA that has dissociated from ribosomes in drop-off events. In the translation experiments (Fig. 2) we could not separate c2 from c3, and therefore rate constants k2 and k3 were combined to k23 when fitting the model parameters to the experimental data as shown in Equation 6, k23=k2k3k2+k3(Eq. 6) The equation system was solved analytically using Maple 7 (Waterloo Maple Inc.), and the solution was used to fit the parameters (k1 to k5) to the experimental data. The fitting was performed using the Marquardt algorithm (22Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) implemented in Origin 7 (OriginLab Corp.). Rate Constants for Macrolide Binding to and Dissociation from Active Ribosomes—It has been suggested (23Dinos G.P. Kalpaxis D.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11621-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Dinos G.P. Connell S.R. Nierhaus K.H. Kalpaxis D.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that macrolide antibiotics bind to the ribosome in two steps, according to Reaction 1, k1k12S+R⇄C1⇄C2k−1k21Reaction 1 where S is free antibiotic; R is free ribosome; C1 is an initial weak complex, and C2 is a strong complex formed between the ribosome and the drug. When the total drug concentration s0 is much larger than the total ribosome concentration r0, then the kinetics of drug binding is described by two coupled linear differential equations, and the solution is always the sum of two exponentially decaying terms and one constant term. When k-1 >> k12, the first binding step equilibrates much faster than the subsequent strong binding of the drug. Elimination of the fast variable (25Elf J. Ehrenberg M. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) can then be used to simplify the slow binding step according to Reaction 2 (26Dinos G. Synetos D. Coutsogeorgopoulos C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10638-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Kk12S+R⇄C1⇄C2k21Reaction 2 Formation of C2 can then be approximated by Equation 7, c2(t)=c¯(1−e−kobst)(Eq. 7) c2(t) and c̄ are the current and equilibrium concentrations of C2, respectively. The compounded rate constant kobs is given by Equation 8, kobs=k12⋅s0s0+K+k21(Eq. 8) The binding of josamycin at different concentrations to the ribosome (Fig. 3A) can be described as a single step reaction, and the equilibration rate constant kobs is perfectly linear in the josamycin concentration (Fig. 3A, inset). Thus in this concentration interval, s0 << K and s0k12 >> k21, meaning that Equation 8 approximates to Equation 9. kobs=kas0=(k12/K)s0(Eq. 9) A putative pre-equilibrium complex C1 for ribosome bound josamycin must have a dissociation constant K larger than 5 × 10-5m to be compatible with the observed linear dependence of kobs on s0 (Fig. 3A, inset). To enhance the precision of the evaluation by accounting for the decrease of concentration of free josamycin, the data points in Fig. 3A were not fitted directly to Equation 7 but instead to Equation 10, tripeptides(%)=100(1−j0(e(r0−j0)ka,Jt−1)−j0+r0e(r0−j0)ka,Jt)(Eq. 10) where j0 is the total josamycin concentration, and r0 is the total concentration of active ribosomes. When the two macrolide antibiotics, josamycin (J) and erythromycin (E), compete for the same binding site on the ribosome, their binding kinetics is described by Reaction 3, provided that the criteria for elimination of fast variables are fulfilled as in Reaction 2. Kd,JkJJ+R⇄CJI⇄CJ2Kd,JKd,EkEE+R⇄CE1⇄CE2Kd,EReaction 3 In experiments at high concentrations j0 and e0 of J and E, respectively, the probability PJ that a ribosome becomes strongly bound to J rather than to E is given by Equations 11 and 12, PJ=ka,J⋅j0ka,J⋅j0+ka,E⋅e0(Eq. 11) so that 1PJ=1+ka,Eka,J⋅e0J0(Eq. 12) The probability, PE, that the ribosome binds strongly to E instead, follows from conservation of probability as given in Equation 13. PE=ka,E⋅e0ka,J⋅j0+ka,E⋅e0(Eq. 13) The compounded rate constants ka,J and ka,E are defined in analogy with ka in Equation 9 as given in Equation 14, ka,J=kJKJ and ka,E=kEKE(Eq. 14) The effective association rate constant ka,J or ka,E approximates either one of the association rate constants for drug binding in the pre-equilibrium complex C1 multiplied with the probability that it continues to the strong complex C2 instead of dissociating. The approximation is valid in the limit of high dissociation probability (k-1 >> k12), which brings Reaction 1 to Reaction 2. The experiment in Fig. 3B was designed with josamycin and erythromycin concentrations in large excess over the ribosome concentration. The incubation time (20 s) was long enough to allow for formation of a strong binding complex with either one of the drugs, as verified in experiments where the extent of binding was monitored as a function of time. The incubation time was also short enough to make exchange of drugs between their strong binding sites negligible (see Table I and below). The slope of the straight line in Fig. 3B was used to obtain the ratio between ka,E and ka,J according to Equation 12.Table IJosamycin and erythromycin ribosome binding kineticsJosamycinErythromycinka (μm-1 s-1)0.0325 ± 0.00071.00 ± 0.04kd (s-1)0.18 × 10-3 ± 0.02 × 10-310.8 × 10-3 ± 0.7 × 10-3KD (nm)5.5 ± 0.510.8 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab When ribosomes have been equilibrated with one macrolide and then another macrolide is added, there will be an exchange of macrolides strongly bound to the ribosome, and this can be monitored experimentally. In addition, when both macrolides are present in large excess over ribosomes as well as over their respective dissociation constants and the affinity of each drug to its strong binding site is large compared with its affinity to the pre-equilibrium site, the exchange kinetics takes a particularly simple form. To see this, assume that all ribosomes are bound to a macrolide at all times. Assume further that kJ >> kd,J and kE >> kd,E so that the ribosomes are in one of their strong complexes CJ2 or CE2. Under those conditions, the full reaction dynamics can be accounted for as transitions between CJ2 and CE2 complexes (Reaction 5). kJECJ2⇄CE2kEJReaction 4 The compounded rate constant kJE is the dissociation rate constant kd,J for J, leaving complex CJ2 multiplied with the probability PE that J will be replaced by E. Similarly, the compounded rate constant kEJ is the dissociation rate constant kd,E for E, leaving complex CE2 multiplied by the probability PJ that E is replaced by J (Equation 15). kJE=kd,J⋅PE and kEJ=kd,E⋅P(Eq. 15) The time variation of the concentration cJ2 is determined by the differential Equation 16, dcJ2dt=−kJEcJ2+kEJcE2(Eq. 16) The concentration cE2 of complex CE2 can be eliminated by the conservation relation cJ2 + cE2 = r0. With the relaxation rate kobs = kJE + kEJ, this gives Equation 17. dcJ2dt=−kobs⋅cJ2+kEJ⋅r0(Eq. 17) Two chase experiments can be used to determine the dissociation rate constants kd,J and kd,E. In the first, ribosomes are pre-equilibrated with J and then E is added (relaxation rate kobs1, see Fig. 3C). In the second experiment, ribosomes are pre-equilibrated with E and then J is added (relaxation rate kobs2, see Fig. 3D). The dissociation rate constants follow from Equation 18, kobs1=kd,JPE1+kd,EPJ1kobs2=kd,JPE2+kd,EPJ2(Eq. 18) which has the solution shown in Equation 19, kd,J=kobs1PJ2−kobs2PJ1PJ2PE1−PJ1PE2 and kd,E=kobs2PE1−kobs1PE2PJ2PE1−PJ1PE2(Eq. 19) The approximations leading to Equation 19 require that the C2 complexes have much higher affinity than the C1 complexes and that the ribosomes are fully saturated with a macrolide at all times. We have estimated the pre-equilibriums for josamycin and erythromycin to be at least a factor of 10,000 or 100, respectively, weaker than their strong binding states, so that these criteria are fulfilled in the experiments in Fig 3, C and D. For the analysis in this section we have assumed for simplicity that the total drug concentrations are always much larger than the ribosome concentration. In some cases, the drug excess was only 3-fold, and here we have accounted for the disappearance of drugs from their free state by ribosome binding in our analysis. Josamycin and erythromycin belong to two different subclasses of the macrolide family and have been reported to inhibit protein synthesis in principally different ways (4Poulsen S.M. Kofoed C. Vester B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This study elucidates their modes of action with kinetic data from a cell-free translation system with pure E. coli components (7Tenson T. Lovmar M. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330 (and references therein): 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 19Pavlov M.Y. Ehrenberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Di- and Tripeptide Formation by Josamycin—It was proposed from the crystal structure of the 50 S ribosomal subunit in complex with carbomycin A, a macrolide very similar to josamycin (Fig. 1A), that the isobutyrate residue of the drug occupies the same site as the side chain of the amino acid on the aminoacyl-tRNA in the A site of the large subunit (Fig. 1C) (13Hansen J.L. Ippolito J.A. Ban N. Nissen P. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 117-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). This is in line with results from biochemical experiments, showing that carbomycin A inactivates peptidyl transfer in an artificial system with puromycin as the acceptor and N-acetyl-Phe-tRNAPhe as the donor (4Poulsen S.M. Kofoed C. Vester B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Mao J.C. Robishaw E.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2054-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, experiments in a more realistic system with heteropolymeric mRNAs show that both fMet-Val-tRNAVal and fMet-Gly-Ile-tRNAIle can be formed on ribosomes in complex with josamycin (7Tenson T. Lovmar M. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330 (and references therein): 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This suggests that the inhibitory action of josamycin can be affected by the identities of the amino acids on the tRNAs in the A and P sites as well as by the length of the amino acid chain on the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site. To study this phenomenon further, we prepared two different mRNAs: one encoding fMet-Phe-Ser and the other encoding fMet-Val-Ser. Ribosomes, initiated with either one of these mRNAs in the absence or presence of josamycin, were rapidly mixed in a quench-flow instrument with all components necessary for the formation fMet-Val-Ser or fMet-Phe-Ser tri-peptides. The amounts of di- and tri-peptides at different incubation times were quantified in an HPLC system with on-line radiometry, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The kinetics of the four reactions could in each case be approximated by a scheme containing only one rate constant for di-peptide formation (k1) and one combined rate constant for tri-peptide formation (k23), including both the rate constant for translocation (k2) and second peptidyl transfer rate constant (k3) (Fig. 4). In the absence of josamycin, k1 was 54 s-1 for fMet-Phe formation and 61 s-1 for fMet-Val formation. The rate constant k23 was 5.7 s-1 for fMet-Phe-Ser formation and 2.3 s-1 for fMet-Val-Ser formation in the absence of josamycin. In the presence of josamycin, k1 was about 0.06 s-1 for fMet-Phe formation and 14 s-1 for fMet-Val formation. The rate constant k23 was too slow to be detected both for fMet-Phe-Ser and fMet-Val-Ser formation in the presence of josamycin. We also studied the effects of erythromycin on the rate constants for di- and tri-peptide formation in the same two cases, and we found no inhibition of any rate constant for either of the two mRNAs (data not shown). In summary, the rate of di-peptide formation was inhibited about 1000-fold by josamycin in the formation of fMet-Phe, and only about 5-fold in the formation of fMet-Val. The rate of tri-peptide formation was reduced to virtually zero by josamycin, but the rates of both di- and tri-peptide formation were unaffected by erythromycin for both mRNAs. This means that ribosomes that contain josamycin can be separated from those that do not contain a macrolide or contain erythromycin by their ability to form the tri-peptide fMet-Phe-Ser. This kinetic difference between ribosomes containing josamycin and ribosomes that do not was used to obtain the complete binding kinetics of both josamycin and erythromycin, as will be described next. Kinetics of Josamycin and Erythromycin Binding to the Ribosome—Josamycin and erythromycin bind competitively to the ribosome, but they block protein synthesis at different lengths of the nascent peptide (7Tenson T. Lovmar M. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330 (and references therein): 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). A ribosome that contains josamycin cannot form an fMet-Phe-Ser pep"

This family of proteins was thought to consist of four members, xanthine oxidoreductase, aldehyde oxidase 1 (AOX1), and the aldehyde oxidase homologues 1 and 2 (AOH1 and AOH2, respectively). Whereas the first two enzymes are present in humans and various other mammalian species, the last two proteins have been described only in mice. Here, we report on the identification, in both mice and rats, of a novel molybdo-flavoenzyme, AOH3. In addition, we have cloned the cDNAs coding for rat AOH1 and AOH2, demonstrating that this animal species has the same complement of molybdo-flavoproteins as the mouse. The AOH3 cDNA is characterized by remarkable similarity to AOX1, AOH1, AOH2, and xanthine oxidoreductase cDNAs. Mouse AOH3 is selectively expressed in Bowman's glands of the olfactory mucosa, although small amounts of the corresponding mRNA are present also in the skin. In the former location, two alternatively spliced forms of the AOH3 transcript with different 3′-untranslated regions were identified. The general properties of AOH3 were determined by purification of mouse AOH3 from the olfactory mucosa. The enzyme possesses aldehyde oxidase activity and oxidizes, albeit with low efficiency, exogenous substrates that are recognized by AOH1 and AOX1. The Aoh3 gene maps to mouse chromosome 1 band c1 and rat chromosome 7 in close proximity to the Aox1, Aoh1, and Aoh2 loci and has an exon/intron structure almost identical to that of the other molybdo-flavoenzyme genes in the two species.

Mammalian molybdo-flavoenzymes are cytosolic proteins consisting of dimers of two identical subunits (1Garattini E. Mendel R. Romao M.J. Wright R. Terao M. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the ∼150-kDa subunit of all members of the family is highly conserved, suggesting a related evolutionary origin from a common ancestor protein (1Garattini E. Mendel R.

XOR, AOX1, AOH1, and AOH2 are the products of distinct genes that maintain an almost superimposing structural organization (15Terao M. Kurosaki M. Marini M. Vanoni M.A. Saltini G. Bonetto V.

This suggests that the extant members of the mammalian molybdo-flavoenzyme family arose from one or more gene duplication events (1Garattini E. Mendel R. Romao M.J. Wright R. Terao M. Biochem.

XOR is a relatively ubiquitous enzyme, being present in many tissues and cell types, although it is synthesized in high amounts in the intestinal tract, liver, and lactating mammary gland (22Harrison R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). XOR catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid (23Harrison R. Drug Metab.

However, the protein may have other tissue- or cell-specific functions, as suggested by the phenotype observed in the Xor knockout mouse (24Vorbach C. Scriven A. Capecchi M.R.

Thus, AOX1 and AOH1 may be of relevance to the development of vertebrates and may control the homeostasis of certain types of tissues in adults. Virtually nothing is known about the substrate specificity of AOH2. In fact, the enzyme is difficult to purify, as it is present in relatively low quantities only in keratinized epithelia (14Terao M.

In fact, this aldehyde oxidase metabolizes numerous xenobiotics, including drugs such as zaleplon (30Lake B.G. Ball S.E. Kao J. Renwick A.B. Price R.J. Scatina J.A. Xenobiotica. 2002; 32: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and 6-mercaptopurine (31Rooseboom M. Commandeur J.N. Vermeulen N.P. Pharmacol.

Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1089-1093PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme has also been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of ethanol in humans and other mammals, as AOX1 oxidizes the toxic metabolite acetaldehyde into acetic acid (33Shaw S. Jayatilleke E. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We proposed that AOH1 may play a similar role in the mouse; however, studies conducted on purified mouse AOX1 and AOH1 indicate that acetaldehyde is a relatively poor substrate for the two enzymes (34Vila R. Kurosaki M. Barzago M.M. Kolek M. Bastone A. Colombo L. Salmona M. Terao M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8668-8683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, results obtained in mouse strains characterized by the synthesis of remarkably different levels of both AOH1 and AOX1 show the same level of acetaldehyde metabolism in vivo (34Vila R. Kurosaki M. Barzago M.M. Kolek M. Bastone A. Colombo L. Salmona M. Terao M. Garattini E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8668-8683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the family of mammalian molybdo-flavoenzymes is larger than originally believed. In fact, we have identified and isolated mouse AOH3, a novel molybdo-flavoenzyme characterized by high similarity to AOX1, AOH1, AOH2, and, to a lesser extent, XOR. The protein is endowed with aldehyde oxidase activity and is selectively expressed in the epithelial mucosa at the level of Bowman's glands. The corresponding cDNAs have been cloned and sequenced in both the mouse and rat. Isolation of the mouse and rat AOH3 cDNAs proved instrumental in the definition of the exon/intron structure of the corresponding genes, which are located on chromosomes 1 and 9, respectively. Finally, we have also cloned and sequenced the cDNAs of the mouse AOH1 and AOH2 orthologous proteins in rats, demonstrating that the two molybdo-enzymes are coded for by genes that cluster with Aox1 and Aoh3 on chromosome 9. These last results demonstrate that the presence of multiple forms of aldehyde oxidases in mammals is not a peculiarity of the mouse. Cloning and Sequencing of cDNAs Coding for Mouse AOH3 and Rat AOH1, AOH2, and AOH3—Total RNA was extracted from mouse olfactory mucosa, and the poly(A+) fraction of the RNA was selected according to standard protocols (14Terao M.

The full-length mouse AOH3 cDNA expressed in olfactory mucosa was isolated as two overlapping fragments, A (nucleotides 72–2332) and B (nucleotides 2247–4425), by reverse transcription followed by nested PCR amplifications. The oligonucleotides used for these experiments were as follows: primary amplimers, 5′-ATCCGAGCCAAGAGGCCAAACTCA-3′ (nucleotides 62–85) and 5′-CCTTTCCTTTCCCTCCATCTGCAGCA-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 4410–4435); and nested primers, 5′-AGAGGCCAAACTCACCAGAGCC-3′ (nucleotides 72–93), 5′-CTTCAGCTACCTGATCCACGTTCT-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 2309–2332), 5′-GCACAATTCGTTCCTGTGCCCTGAA-3′ (nucleotides 2247–2271), and 5′-CCCTCCATCTGCAGCAACATTTAC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 4402–4425). The amplified DNA fragments (pAOH3-A and pAOH3-B) were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the AT cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The mouse AOH3 cDNA was also isolated from skin poly(A+) RNA in a similar way, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Rat AOH1, AOH2, and AOH3 cDNAs were isolated from liver, skin, and olfactory mucosa poly(A+) RNAs, respectively, by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR techniques using sense strand amplimers coding for the first eight N-terminal amino acids and antisense amplimers corresponding to the seven C-terminal amino acids and the stop codon. The resulting amplified cDNA fragments representing the entire coding regions of each protein were subcloned in pBluescript and sequenced. Determination of the 5′- and 3′-Ends of the Mouse AOH3 Transcripts—The 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments for the mouse AOH3 cDNAs were performed with the commercially available Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the nested PCR protocol and using the following amplimers: SP1, 5′-CGGATCGTGTTGTGACACCATCACTG-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 263–288 of the mouse AOH3 cDNA); and NP1, 5′-TGTGACACCATCACTGTGCAGGC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 256–278 of the mouse AOH3 cDNA). 3′-RACE of the mouse AOH3 cDNAs was conducted as described above with the following amplimers: SP2, 5′-AAGAGACATAGCGGAGGACTTCACAG-3′ (nucleotides 3990–4015); and NP2, 5′-GACTTCACAGTGAAGAGCCCAGCA-3′ (nucleotides 4006–4029). The resulting PCR products were subcloned in pBluescript, and multiple clones were sequenced to determine the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mouse AOH3 transcript. In Situ Hybridization Experiments—The plasmid pAOH3-A was linearized with HindIII and used as template for the synthesis of anti-sense riboprobe employing T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) in the presence of [35S]thio-UTP as described (14Terao M.

Mouse tissues were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde overnight, embedded in paraffin, sectioned to 5-μm thickness, and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. The conditions for the pretreatment of slides, hybridization, washing, and detection by the nuclear track emulsion technique were as described in a previous report (14Terao M. Kurosaki M. Saltini G.

At the end of the in situ hybridization procedure, tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and photographed under a microscope. Purification of Mouse Olfactory Mucosa AOH3 Protein, Electrophoresis, and Western Blot Analysis—Unless otherwise stated, all purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Male mouse olfactory mucosa was dissected and homogenized in 3 volumes of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 with an Ultraturrax homogenizer (Ika, Stanten, Germany). Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to obtain cytosolic extracts. Extracts were heated at 55 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g to remove precipitated proteins. An equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The solution was passed through a Sephadex PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) to eliminate the residual ammonium sulfate. The eluate (3.5 ml) was applied to a Mono Q 5/5 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences AB) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The AOH3 protein was eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a linear gradient (30 ml) of 0–1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The purification of AOH3 was monitored by quantitative Western blot analysis (34Vila R. Kurosaki M. Barzago M.M. Kolek M. Bastone A. Colombo L. Salmona M. Terao M. Garattini E. J. Biol.

A specific rabbit anti-AOH3 polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide of the protein (SGRIKALDIE, amino acids 868–877) was used for Western blot analysis, which was carried out following a chemiluminescence-based protocol as described (14Terao M.

This antibody is monospecific and does not cross-react with purified mouse AOX1 and AOH1 and recombinant mouse XOR, AOX1, AOH1, and AOH2 transiently expressed in human epithelial kidney HEK293 cells (data not shown). For quantitative Western blot analysis, an equivalent volume (10 μl) of protein solution, at each purification step, was loaded on the same gel and processed for analysis. Chemiluminescent signals corresponding to AOH3 bands were quantitated with a scanning densitometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). The total amount of AOH3 immunoreactive protein in the various experimental samples is expressed in arbitrary units and was calculated on the basis of the intensity of the Western blot signal in absorbance multiplied by the total volume of each purification step. One arbitrary unit of immunoreactive protein corresponds to 1.0 A unit of the specific AOH3 band in each experimental sample. Zymographic analysis of aldehyde-oxidizing activity was performed following electrophoresis on cellulose acetate plates. Plates were overlaid with 1.2% agarose containing 0.3 mm phenazine methosulfate (Sigma), 0.9 mm 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma), and the selected enzyme substrate at 10 mm (14Terao M.

Proteins were measured according to the Bradford method with a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). Characterization of the Purified AOH3 Protein by Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometric and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric analyses of AOH3 tryptic peptides were performed according to standard protocols following in-gel tryptic digestion (34Vila R.

Briefly, the Coomassie Blue-stained gel slice corresponding to purified AOH3 was incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C for 30 min to reduce disulfide bridges. Thiol groups were alkylated upon reaction with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. Tryptic digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Peptides were extracted twice in 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid. The combined extracts were lyophilized, redissolved in 0.5% formic acid, and desalted using ZipTip (Millipore Corp.). Peptides were eluted in 50% acetonitrile and 0.5% formic acid. The eluate was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a saturated matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:3, v/v). Mass mapping of tryptic peptides was performed with a Bruker Reflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The data generated were processed with the Mascot program (www.matrixscience.com/) (34Vila R. Kurosaki M. Barzago M.M. Kolek M. Bastone A. Colombo L. Salmona M. Terao M. Garattini E. J. Biol.

De novo sequence analysis was carried out via collision-induced dissociation on an API 3000 electrospray mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, San Diego, CA). The data were confirmed by comparison of the experimental and theoretical collision-induced dissociation spectra of the tryptic peptides derived from the AOH3 protein sequence derived from the corresponding cDNA. DNA Sequencing and Determination of the Exon/Intron Structure of the Mouse Aoh3 and Rat Aoh1, Aoh2, and Aoh3 Genes—Appropriate DNA fragments were subcloned into the pBluescript plasmid vector and sequenced according to the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method using double-stranded DNA as template and T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences AB) or Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Oligodeoxynucleotide primers were custom-synthesized by M-Medical srl (Florence, Italy). Computer analysis of the DNA sequences was performed using the GeneWorks sequence analysis system (Intelligenetics, San Diego). Comparison of the nucleotide and protein sequences of the full-length cDNAs corresponding to mouse AOH3 and rat AOH1, AOH2, and AOH3 with the complete mouse and rat genomic sequences present in the NCBI Database resulted in the determination of the exon/intron structure of the corresponding genes. Cloning and Characterization of the Mouse cDNA Coding for the Novel Molybdo-flavoprotein AOH3—In silico analysis of the NCBI Database for nucleotide sequences of the mouse genome showing similarity to the AOX1, AOH1, and AOH2 cDNAs resulted in the identification of exons coding for a potential and novel molybdo-flavoprotein, which we named AOH3. The identified exon sequences were used for the design of appropriate oligonucleotides that allowed the amplification of overlapping cDNA fragments of mouse AOH3 by RT-PCR from olfactory mucosa and, subsequently, from skin RNA. The first source of AOH3 RNA was selected on the basis of a preliminary search in the mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) data base. Fig. 1 illustrates the nucleotide sequence of the full-length AOH3 cDNA isolated from mouse olfactory mucosa. The 5′-untranslated region is relatively short (93 nucleotides) and contains a stretch of DNA around the putative first methionine codon (GCCATGC) that is similar to the canonical ribosome-binding consensus sequence (RCCATGG) (35Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region is much longer and is characterized by the absence of a canonical polyadenylation signal. As this portion of the cDNA was obtained by 3′-RACE, the lack of a polyadenylation signal is likely to be the result of the synthesis of an incomplete 3′ terminus. In fact, a typical polyadenylation consensus sequence (AATAAA) is present in the mouse genome (NCBI accession no. NT_039170), 215 bases downstream of the nucleotide corresponding to the last base of our AOH3 cDNA. More important, two ESTs present in the NCBI Database and corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the AOH3 transcript (BQ71452 and BQ898169) extend to the above-mentioned polyadenylation site. The 3′-sequence of the olfactory mucosa AOH3 cDNA is different from that of the corresponding mouse skin cDNA and is the result of a tissue-specific splicing event (see Table III).Table IIIExon/intron organization of the mouse Aoh3 gene Exon sequences are in uppercase letters, and intron sequences are in lowercase letters.

Previously, the extracellular domain of recombinant DC-SIGN has been shown to assemble as tetramers and in the current study we use a short range covalent cross-linker and show that DC-SIGN exists as tetramers on the surface of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells. There was no evidence of direct binding between DC-SIGN and CD4 either by cross-linking or by fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements suggesting that there is no constitutive association of the majority of these proteins in the membrane. Importantly we also show that the tetrameric complexes, in contrast to DC-SIGN monomers, bind with high affinity to high mannose glycoproteins such as mannan or HIV gp120 suggesting that such an assembly is required for high affinity binding of glycoproteins to DC-SIGN, providing the first direct evidence that DC-SIGN tetramers are essential for high affinity interactions with pathogens like HIV.

Immunology. 2002; 3: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), which recognize and internalize pathogens and subsequently activate T cells with pathogen-derived peptides. To internalize pathogens, DCs express a series of pathogen recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors that recognize lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharide, or bacterial DNA commonly found on various bacteria. C-type (calcium-dependent) lectin receptors (CLRs) are also expressed and these bind to conserved oligosaccharides that are commonly found on the surface glycoproteins of viruses. CLRs expressed by DCs include the mannose receptor (CD206), DEC-205 (CD205), Langerin (CD207), and DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; CD209) (3Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Adema G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunology. 2002; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). These receptors differ not only in their expression on various subsets of DCs and other tissues, but they also recognize different oligosaccharides thus discriminating between different ligands (3Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y.

DC-SIGN is a 44 kDa type II transmembrane protein that consists of a carbohydrate recognition domain, a neck domain involved in oligomerization, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail mediating interactions with the endocytosis machinery important for ligand internalization (4Frison N.

Cunningham A.L. Nat. Immunology. 2002; 3: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Other non-viral pathogens can also interact with DC-SIGN (11van Kooyk Y. Geijtenbeek T.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Many of these viruses, however, have evolved a mechanism leading to their escape from lysosomal degradation and allowing them either to infect DCs or to hide inside the cells followed by transfer to and infection of T cells when these cells are being activated by the mature DC. In mature monocyte-derived DCs (mMDDCs) it has been shown that HIV binding to DC-SIGN and subsequent internalization into the DC does not lead to the complete degradation and part of it is protected and subsequently infects T cells (12Moris A. Nobile C. Buseyene F. Porrot F. Abastado J.-P. Schwartz O. Blood. 2004; 103: 2648-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Turville S.G. Santos J.J. Frank I. Cameron P.U. Wilkinson J.

The mechanism of this protection is poorly understood (11van Kooyk Y. Geijtenbeek T.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 14Kwon D.S. Gregorio G. Bitton N. Hendrickson W.A. Littman D.R. Immunity. 2002; 16: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) but it has been suggested that it is an HIV-induced change in endocytic routing (11van Kooyk Y. Geijtenbeek T.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 13Turville S.G. Santos J.J. Frank I. Cameron P.U. Wilkinson J. Miranda-Saksena M. Dable J. Stossel H. Romani N. Piatak M. Lifson J.D. Pope M. Cunningham A.L. Blood. 2003; 103: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a minor proportion of HIV is transferred to the CD4/CCR5-mediated infection pathway. A detailed knowledge of the DC-SIGN interaction with glycoproteins is thus crucial for the understanding of DC-SIGN-induced routing of internalized ligands and involves both the selectivity for individual sugar structures as well as the stoichiometry of the DC-SIGN-ligand complex including any DC-SIGN-associated proteins in the cell membrane. Crystal structural data have revealed that DC-SIGN binds to internal tri-mannose glycosylation structures present in N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides. The receptor makes contact with the three adjacent mannose residues at an internal branched structure but fails to bind to the core tri-mannose motif in complex oligosaccharides because of steric interference resulting from different anomeric linkages (15Feinberg H. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. Science. 2001; 294: 2163-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). This observation explained the preference of DC-SIGN for high mannose carbohydrate structures and is in contrast to binding characteristics of other CLRs such as the mannose receptor, which has been suggested to bind to single terminal mannose residues (11van Kooyk Y. Geijtenbeek T.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Based on the oligomerization of its extracellular domain it was suggested that DC-SIGN forms tetramers and that this oligomerization enhances the affinity for neoglycoproteins (5Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Support for this is provided by electron microscopy detection of clusters of DC-SIGN residing in rafts on the surface of immature monocyte-derived DCs (iMDDCs) (16Cambi A. de Lange F. van Maarseveen N.M. Nijhuis M. Joosten B. van Dijk E.M.H.P. de Bakker B.I. Fransen J.A.M. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. van Leeuwen F.N. Van Hulst N.F. Figdor C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It is therefore proposed that the interaction between DC-SIGN and glycoproteins involves several molecules of DC-SIGN binding to differential sugar moieties on the glycoprotein spaced at appropriate distances determined by the DC-SIGN oligomerization (5Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, tetramer formation on the cell surface has not yet been proven. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether DC-SIGN associates with any other proteins and how this could influence ligand binding. This is especially important as the mechanism of cis infection of DCs by HIV suggests a possible association between CD4/CCR5 and DC-SIGN in the plasma membrane and such an association has been shown by colocalization on alveolar macrophages but the authors were unable to co-immunoprecipitate those molecules in transiently transfected cells (17Lee B. Leslie G. Soilleux E. O'Doherty U. Baik S. Levroney E. Flummerfelt K. Swiggard W. Coleman N. Malim M. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12028-12038Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Here we report the use of novel “proteomics” techniques based on mass spectrometry (MS) along with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements to investigate lateral protein associations of native DC-SIGN on iMDDCs. We have reported recently the versatility of those tools in determining lateral membrane protein associations on lymphoid cells (18Bernhard O.K. Sheil M.M. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this article, we use cross-linking, immunopurification, and Western blotting to show that DC-SIGN assembles into oligomers of very high apparent molecular weight on the cell-surface of iMDDCs. Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified complexes identified them as homo-oligomers of DC-SIGN and cross-linking at different concentrations of the cross-linker suggests that they are tetramers. However, CD4 could not be detected in the complexes. Furthermore FRET measurements and cross-linking followed by co-immunoprecipitation also did not detect any CD4/DC-SIGN association. We also show for the first time that the DC-SIGN complexes bind immobilized mannan (a yeast-derived polysaccharide) as well as gp120 with high affinity whereas DC-SIGN monomers are not bound. This confirms the formation of DC-SIGN tetramers on immature iMDDCs, shows that they do not associate with other proteins and that the oligomerization mediated by the lateral organization in the membrane is required for high affinity ligand binding. Cells and Reagents—Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. Immature MDDCs were prepared from blood monocytes as described previously (2Turville S.G. Cameron P.U. Handley A. Lin G. Pöhlmann S. Doms R.W. Cunningham A.L. Nat. Immunology. 2002; 3: 975-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The T lymphoblastoid cell line CemT4 and the CD4-negative lymphoblastoid derivative cell line A2.01 were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS reagents and reference program (Rockville, MD). OKT4 hybridoma cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection. Q4120 hybridoma cells were a generous gift from Dr. Quentin Sattentau (Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Marseille, France), and WM82 hybridoma cells were donated by Dr. Tony Hennicker (Westmead Hospital, Westmead, NSW, Australia). The DC-SIGN specific monoclonal antibody 120507 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against DC-SIGN was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HIV-1 gp120 (Clade E, 3234, used for co-immunoprecipitations) was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Program. Sheep polyclonal antibody raised against gp120 (Lot DV-012) had been obtained from the Center for Biologicals Evaluation and Research (FDA, Bethesda, MD). Mouse IgG1 was from Sigma. The horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP), were from Pierce, protein G-Sepharose and Cy3 monoreactive NHS ester from Amersham Biosciences. 6-(Fluorescein-5-carboxamido)hexanoic acid was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and PMA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cross-linking and Cell Lysate Preparation—Cells were washed twice with cross-link buffer (CLB) (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3) and resuspended in CLB at 5 × 106 cells/ml. DSS or DSP were dissolved in Me2SO at 25 mm or at lower concentrations when indicated and added to the suspension (20 μl per 1 ml suspension). Cross-linking was carried out for 30 min at room temperature followed by quenching of the cross-linker, which was done by adding TBS, pH 7.5, pelleting the cells, and resuspending them in TBS, pH 7.5 for 15 min. Cells were pelleted again and lysed in CLB containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 1 h at 4°C. Insoluble debris was pelleted for 10 min at 4 °C and 10 000 × g and the cleared lysate was supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2. For the preparation of a mock lysate, Me2SO was added without dissolved DSS. For direct analysis, lysate was then supplemented with 5× SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated on an 8–16% gradient gel or a 5% gel, Western-blotted, and DC-SIGN was detected with a polyclonal antibody. To generate CemT4 and A2.01 lysates, cells were harvested, washed twice with CLB, and lysed in CLB containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 1 h at 4 °C. Insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitations and Co-immunoprecipitations—Affinity beads were generated by coupling the monoclonal antibodies Q4120 (anti-CD4) and the anti-DC-SIGN antibody as well as mouse IgG1 to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions. For precipitation of DC-SIGN complexes, 0.5 ml lysates were precipitated with 2.5 μg of anti-DC-SIGN antibody bound to 20 μl of protein G beads. For detecting cross-linking of the CD4 and DC-SIGN receptors, 0.5 ml lysates were precipitated with 20 μl of Q4120 beads (specific for CD4) or 20 μl of anti-DC-SIGN beads. For co-immunoprecipitating gp120 and DC-SIGN, 10 μl of anti-gp120 serum-bound to 20 μl of protein G beads were incubated with 1 ml of lysate. All incubations were performed for 1 h at room temperature. For co-immunoprecipitations, 2.5 μg of gp120 was incubated with the lysate for 1 h at room temperature prior to addition to the antibody bound to the beads. For precipitations with mannan beads the beads were washed with HBS, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then incubated with the lysate. After binding the beads were washed 5× with HBS, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer. If indicated, DTT was added to a concentration of 50 mm for reduction of the disulfide bonds. Proteins were separated on an 8–16% gradient gel and again Western-blotted. DC-SIGN and CD4 were detected using polyclonal antibodies. Affinity Purification of DC-SIGN Complexes—Lysate from about 9 × 107 iMDDCs that had been treated with DSS was first passed over ∼100 μl of IgG1-Sepharose to absorb nonspecific binding proteins and subsequently passed over ∼100 μl of anti-DC-SIGN beads (containing ∼100–150 μg of immobilized antibody). The beads were then washed with TBS, pH 8.0 containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Complexes were eluted by boiling the beads for 5 min in 1× SDS sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and Protein Identification Using Mass Spectrometry— The eluate (50 μl) was loaded onto a 8–16% gradient gel (Gradipore, Frenchs Forest, NSW), and proteins were separated with a constant current of 25 mA per gel. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described previously (18Bernhard O.K. Sheil M.M. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Excised gel slices were washed, subjected to in-gel digest, and the tryptic peptides were extracted and purified as described elsewhere (18Bernhard O.K. Sheil M.M. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analyses were carried out using a Quadrupole-Time-of-flight (Q-Tof 2) instrument (Micromass/Waters, Manchester, UK) in nanoelectrospray mode. Typically 5–8 μl of sample were loaded into a coated glass capillary (Protana, Odense, Denmark). The mass spectrometry data acquisition was performed as described in our previous studies (18Bernhard O.K. Sheil M.M. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Bernhard O.K. Burgess J.A. Hochgrebe T. Sheil M.M. Cunningham A.L. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 139-146Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and all multi-charged ions that were clearly distinguishable from the background were selected for subsequent fragmentation and analyses (in so-called tandem mass spectrometry or MS/MS experiments). Spectra were interpreted and matched using the MASCOT search engine (www.matrixscience.com/cgi/index.pl?page=/search_form_select.html) and checked manually if the score obtained was below 50. FRET Measurements on CD4-DC-SIGN Association—The monoclonal antibodies Q4120, OKT4, WM82, and anti-DC-SIGN were labeled with either fluorescein or Cy3 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immature MDDCs were labeled similarly as described for flow cytometry (18Bernhard O.K. Sheil M.M. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) without fixing the cells. Cells were stained with unconjugated CD4 and DC-SIGN antibody (blank sample), with unconjugated DC-SIGN antibody and fluorescein conjugated CD4 antibody (donor sample), with Cy3-conjugated DC-SIGN antibody and unconjugated CD4 antibody (acceptor sample) and Cy3-conjugated DC-SIGN antibody and fluorescein-conjugated CD4 antibody (FRET sample). Flow cytometry analysis was carried out using a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) with a 488 nm laser. Cells were gated to exclude debris and dead cells and mean fluorescence intensities were used for analysis. Two fluorescence intensities were collected, FL1 at 530 nm and FL2 at 585 nm. All samples were stored on ice until analyzed. Cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for a given time and then analyzed again. For cell stimulation, 100 ng/ml PMA was added at the same time to each sample before the incubation period. Nothing was added to mock-treated samples. Energy transfer efficiencies were determined as donor fluorescence quenching and calculated using the formula in Equation 1.E=[{FL1(Donor)−FL1(FRET)}/{FL1(Donor)−FL1(Acceptor)}]×100% (Eq. 1) Complexes of High Molecular Weight-containing DC-SIGN Can Be Detected after Cross-linking—Because DC-SIGN was reported to form tetramers based on the properties of the recombinantly expressed extracellular domain, we investigated here, whether DC-SIGN is engaged in lateral protein interactions on the surface of iMDDCs. Cells were treated with DSS or subjected to a mock treatment (see above), and DC-SIGN was visualized after PAGE separation and Western blotting using a DC-SIGN-specific polyclonal antibody. Fig. 1 shows the detection of DC-SIGN in lysates and immunoprecipitates from mock or DSS-treated cells. In a whole cell lysate from mock-treated iMDDCs, DC-SIGN shows an apparent molecular mass of around 50 kDa, which is a good approximation to the theoretical molecular mass of 44 kDa from PAGE results alone. DC-SIGN present in a clarified lysate from mock-treated cells shows a similar molecular mass to that in untreated cells, whereas DC-SIGN present in the lysate from cells treated with DSS has an apparent molecular mass of more than 300 kDa. This indicates that DC-SIGN was cross-linked into large complexes. Immunoprecipitation of DC-SIGN with a murine monoclonal antibody confirms that the detected species are monomers and large complexes of DC-SIGN. The band at ∼250 kDa in the DSS sample from precipitation with anti-DC-SIGN antibody (and similar bands in later figures) is the murine anti-DC-SIGN antibody that is weakly recognized by the anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The Complexes are Homo-oligomers of DC-SIGN—To investigate whether the identified large complexes of DC-SIGN are homo-oligomers or associations with other molecules, complexes were affinity-purified from ∼9 × 107 iMDDCs after DSS treatment, separated on a polyacrylamide gel and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Purification with IgG1 Sepharose prior to the DC-SIGN purification was included as a control for nonspecific binding. Fig. 2 shows the visualized proteins from the DC-SIGN and the control purification. A band of high molecular mass can be seen in the lane containing the purified DC-SIGN complexes whereas a band of around 250 kDa can be seen in the control lane. Mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on the excised bands to determine their protein composition. Table I shows the peptides detected in the sample derived from the in-gel digest from the visible DC-SIGN complex. Using the sensitive nano-ESI-MS and nano-ESI-MS/MS-techniques, ten tryptic peptides from DC-SIGN were detected whereas no other protein was identified showing that the complexes are most likely homo-oligomers of DC-SIGN. Further, no ions that could represent cross-linked peptides could be detected. The band in the control purification was identified as murine IgG1 (data not shown) suggesting that some antibody eluted from the beads during boiling of the sample. The intensity of the antibody-derived band was subject to run-to-run differences and was weaker in subsequent control purifications. Further, in some DC-SIGN purifications confirming the isolation of complexes containing only DC-SIGN, IgG-derived peptides could be detected suggesting that the intensity of the antibody-derived band varies from sample to sample (data not shown).Table IDC-SIGN-derived peptides identified in the purified complexesPrecursorPeptideSequencePositionMASCOT SCOREm/zaExperimentally determined m/z value.massbTheoretical uncharged monoisotopic peptide mass.818.91635.8SAEEQNFLQLQSSR296-30987784.91567.9LQQLGLLEEEQLR9-2158760.91519.8QQEIYQELTQLK235-24632753.41504.8LQEIYQELTQLK97-10862663.81325.6M*QEIYQELTRcM* indicates oxidized methionine.166-17570655.81309.6MQEIYQELTR166-17518654.31306.7QQEIYQELTR189-198dProtein produces multiple peptides of the same sequence, only the first position is shown.37646.31291.7LQEIYQELTR120-12952609.31216.6VPSSISQEQSR63-7353528.31054.6EVGAQLVVIK286-29547457.3912.5AAVGELPEK109-117dProtein produces multiple peptides of the same sequence, only the first position is shown.60a Experimentally determined m/z value.b Theoretical uncharged monoisotopic peptide mass.c M* indicates oxidized methionine.d Protein produces multiple peptides of the same sequence, only the first position is shown. Open table in a new tab The High Molecular Weight Complexes Are Tetramers—In order to deduce the oligomerization state of the complexes, iMDDCs were subjected to cross-linking with different concentrations of DSS. Cells were then lysed and the cleared lysate separated on 8–16% gradient gels as well as on 5% gels in order to increase the resolution in the high molecular weight region of the gel. Fig. 3 shows representative DC-SIGN oligomers detected in the cleared lysate after cells had been treated with increasing concentrations of DSS. It can be seen in Fig. 3A that the amount of monomeric DC-SIGN gradually decreases and that bands of high apparent molecular weight appear with increasing concentration of the cross-linker. Fig. 3B shows resolution of the high molecular mass bands into three individual bands indicating that they consist of DC-SIGN dimers, trimers and tetramers. Dimers are detected at an apparent molecular mass of around 100 kDa slightly below a nonspecific recognized band. Trimer bands migrate at ∼150 kDa whereas the tetramer bands are detected slightly below 250 kDa. In each case the migration is slightly above the predicted molecular mass, which is probably a consequence of some globularity being retained through the cross-linking that interferes with the normal migration of the proteins through the gel. A similar effect can be seen in Fig. 2, where the antibody of a molecular mass of 150 kDa migrates at an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa. This is probably because of the globularity of the antibody that is retained through the intact interchain disulfide bridges. The Tetramers Bind to Mannan and HIV-1 gp120 —It has been proposed that DC-SIGN tetramerization is required for high affinity ligand binding. An increased affinity of the extracellular domain of recombinant DC-SIGN for mannosylated BSA was detected when the neck region required for oligomerization was present (5Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To directly investigate whether HIV gp120 as well as yeast-derived mannan binds with higher affinity to DC-SIGN tetramers than to monomers on dendritic cells, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments between the molecules. Fig. 4 shows the co-immunoprecipitation of DC-SIGN tetramers (arrow) with HIV gp120 whereas DC-SIGN monomers, detected by precipitation with a murine anti-DC-SIGN antibody, were not detected in Fig. 4B. In Fig. 4A nonspecific bands from contaminating antibody obscured in Fig. 4A at ∼50 kDa where the gel had not been reduced. This shows"

The revised open reading frame codes for a classic mitochondrial targeting signal, which is processed from Zim17 in the mitochondrial matrix. Loss of Zim17 selectively diminishes import of proteins into the matrix of mitochondria, but this loss of Zim17 is partially suppressed by overexpression of the J-protein Pam18/Tim14. We propose that Zim17 functions as an example of a “fractured” J-protein, where a protein like Zim17 contributes a zinc finger domain to Type III J-proteins, in toto providing for substrate loading onto Hsp70. Molecular chaperones of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) family bind short, unfolded, hydrophobic segments of substrate polypeptides (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). The Hsp70 has both a substrate-binding domain and an ATPase domain, and substrate-binding activity is coupled to ATP hydrolysis (2Gething M.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1573-1576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 3Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A member of the J-protein family usually works as a coupling factor, stimulating ATPase activity of the Hsp70 once the Hsp70 has substrate occupying its substrate-binding domain (3Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). J-proteins are characterized by a small J-domain that docks to and stimulates the ATPase domain of Hsp70, and a combination of zinc finger and carboxyl-terminal domains that together assist binding non-native structures in a substrate polypeptide (4Banecki B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In combination, the J-protein can load substrate into the binding-pocket of Hsp70 and stimulate the hydrolysis of ATP for productive chaperone action. The import of mitochondrial proteins requires the activity of Hsp70s at several stages (7Jensen R.E. Johnson A.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R779-R782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8Voos W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Voos W. Rottgers K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, and these relatively hydrophobic polypeptides must remain unfolded (or be actively unfolded) to cross the mitochondrial membranes and only subsequently fold to their final structure (9Voos W. Rottgers K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Matouschek A. Pfanner N. Voos W.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the later stages of the mitochondrial protein import pathway, Hsp70 activity is localized at the TIM23 complex (one of the translocases in the inner mitochondrial membrane) where cycles of ATP hydrolysis by the chaperone are used to effectively drive translocation of the substrate across the membrane. Precursor proteins encounter the mitochondrial Hsp70, mtHsp70 (also called Ssc1), immediately upon entry of the terminus of the unfolded polypeptide in the matrix (12Kubrich M. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Scherer P.E. Krieg U.C. Hwang S.T. Vestweber D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); mtHsp70 provides both the driving force for translocation of polypeptides through the TIM23 complex and works in the matrix to fold protein substrates once imported (9Voos W. Rottgers K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 14Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). J-proteins in the mitochondrial matrix can regulate the activity of mtHsp70. One of these, Mdj1, has all the sequence features of a J-protein, a J-domain to stimulate ATPase activity and the zinc finger and carboxyl-terminal domains to interact with substrate polypeptide. Mdj1 assists mtHsp70 to fold mitochondrial proteins after import but is not involved in regulating mtHsp70 activity in its role of driving protein translocation through the TIM23 complex (15Rowley N.

Instead, the J-protein Pam18/Tim14 is anchored in the inner membrane in association with the TIM23 complex to display a J-domain close by the site of polypeptide translocation. Pam18/Tim14 stimulates the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 during import (19Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 20Truscott K.N. Voos W. Frazier A.E. Lind M. Li Y. Geissler A. Dudek J. Muller H. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Guiard B.

We hypothesized that Pam18/Tim14 and perhaps other J-proteins in yeast might represent “fractured” J-proteins where the J-domain and a functionally related zinc finger domain might be found in trans. Therefore we scanned the yeast genome for proteins homologous to the zinc finger domain regions of the archetypal J-protein DnaJ. In addition to the five J-protein homologues we found two proteins that might represent the zinc finger subunits of fractured J-proteins. One of these, Zim17, is found in the mitochondrial matrix, is essential for viability of yeast cells, and has homologues in a range of eukaryotic species. Decreased expression of Zim17 leads to specific defects in protein translocation into the matrix, and in vitro assays show that Zim17 binds to unfolded precursor proteins. We suggest that Zim17 is an essential component of the import motor acting together with Tim14/Pam18 to present substrate polypeptides to mtHsp70 for their translocation through the mitochondrial membranes. Plasmids, Yeast Strains, and Media—DNA fragments corresponding to Zim17 (YNL310c), Pam18/Tim14 (YLR008c), Tim44 (YIL022w), Tim23 (YNR017w), Pam16 (YJL104w), mtHsp70 (YJR045c), Mdj1 (YFL016c), and Mdj2 (YNL328c) were amplified by PCR using primers that generated in-frame restriction sites. PCR products were cloned into pYPGE2 under the control of the PGK promoter (27Brunelli J.P. Pall M.L. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Zim17 was further cloned into a centromeric plasmid (with the URA3 gene for selection) to encode Zim17-GFP called pSF23 or into a centromeric plasmid (with the LEU2 gene for selection) expressing Zim17 under control of the GAL promoter. Those two plasmids were used for transformation into the Δzim17 strain (MATa leu2 ura3 rme1 trp1 his3Δ GAL+ HMLa zim17::kanMX/pSF23 or/pSF19). Yeast was grown at 30 °C on YPAD (2% (w/v) glucose, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone supplemented with adenine sulfate) or YPGal (2% (w/v) galactose, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone supplemented with adenine sulfate). Preparation of Mitochondria, in Vitro Imports, Na2CO3 Extraction, and Protease Sensitivity—Mitochondria were isolated according to procedures described in Ref. 28Daum G. Gasser S.M. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13075-13080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and in vitro transcription; radiolabeling of precursor proteins and import into mitochondria were conducted according to procedures described in Ref. 29Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. To de-energize mitochondria, imports were performed in presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (Sigma). Osmotic shock treatment to produce “mitoplasts” from mitochondria and trypsin treatments was performed as described (30Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Muller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 31Beilharz T. Suzuki C.K. Lithgow T. J. Biol.

Membranes were extracted by resuspension in 100 mm Na2CO3 and incubation for 30 min on ice with intermittent vortexing. Soluble and insoluble proteins were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman Airfuge. Samples of mitochondrial protein (100 μg) were separated by Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and Western blots were carried out according to published methods (31Beilharz T. Suzuki C.K. Lithgow T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35268-35272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Fluorescence Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopy, cells were visualized directly or after staining with MitoTracker (MitoTracker red CM-H2X Ros) according to the standard protocol from Molecular Probes. All fluorescence images were captured using a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal scanning laser microscope mounted on a Zeiss Axioscop. Serial Dilutions—Transformants of pYPGE2 constructs were grown in selective minimal media with glucose overnight. Each transformant suspension was then diluted to A600 = 0.2, and 6-μl drops of serial 5-fold dilutions were spotted onto selective minimal media containing either glucose (to repress Zim17 expression) or galactose (to induce Zim17 expression). Protein Purification and in Vitro Binding Assay—The coding region of Zim17 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-2T for expression in Escherichia coli. After transformation into BL21 cells and growth to an A600 of 0.8, protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested 2 h after induction and disrupted by two bursts (each of 2-min duration) in a mini-bead-beater-8 (Biospec Products) using silica/zirconia beads. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of glutathione-agarose was incubated with cleared extracts for 2 h at 4 °C. Unbound protein was removed by washing with washing buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 400 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Beads with bound protein were resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 m KCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA) and incubated with in vitro-synthesized 35S-labeled proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed eight times with washing buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.3 m KCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA) and eluted in 25 ml of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for separation on SDS-PAGE and analysis by autoradiography. The zinc finger domain of DnaJ is 56 amino acids in length and centered around four pairs of cysteine residues (4Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14840-14848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 6Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Using the zinc finger domain of the bacterial J-protein DnaJ as a probe, BLAST analysis of the yeast genome revealed matches with seven proteins: Ydj1, Xdj1, Apj1, Scj1, Mdj1, Hua1, and Zim17 (Fig. 1A). Five of the yeast proteins (Mdj1, Scj1, Apj1, Ydj1, and Xdj1) are Type I J-proteins carrying a J-domain as well as the DnaJ-type zinc finger domain (25Walsh P. Bursac D. Law Y.C. Cyr D. Lithgow T. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Hua1 and Zim17 are novel proteins, and apart from the zinc finger domain neither Zim17 nor Hua1 has sequences conforming to known domain signatures. There are a minimum of 14 different classes of zinc finger domains (33Matthews J.M. Sunde M. IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and although yeast encode at least 50 proteins with zinc finger domains (34Bohm S. Frishman D. Mewes H.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2464-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) none of these others are sufficiently well conserved to be detected by pair-wise alignments with the zinc finger domain of the J-proteins. Hua1 is a cytoplasmic protein with a possible role in assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton (35Samanta M.P. Liang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12579-12583Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Zim17 is a novel protein, one of about 800 proteins found in the mitochondrial proteome (36Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Joppich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schonfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13207-13212Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The mature protein as analyzed from isolated mitochondria has an apparent molecular mass of 17 kDa, judged by its mobility on SDS-PAGE, 1N. Pfanner, personal communication. and having a zinc finger motif is named Zim17. The function of Zim17 is fundamental in eukaryotes, with homologous proteins encoded in the genome of diverse species of eukaryotes including animals, plants, and protozoans (Fig. 1B). Reannotation of the YNL310c (ZIM17) Gene—In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zim17 is encoded by the nuclear gene YNL310c. However, we found that the open reading frame originally assigned to the YNL310c gene is likely in error because of a fortuitous upstream ATG sequence. By comparisons of the total genome sequence from six related species of Saccharomyces, Cliften et al. (37Cliften P. Sudarsanam P. Desikan A. Fulton L. Fulton B. Majors J. Waterston R. Cohen B.A. Johnston M. Science. 2003; 301: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) recently showed that discrete, conserved intergenic regions corresponding to promoter elements can be detected. In addition to discovering these important gene control elements, comparative genomics of this sort can be used to re-define open reading frames and intron-exon boundaries (37Cliften P. Sudarsanam P. Desikan A. Fulton L. Fulton B. Majors J. Waterston R. Cohen B.A. Johnston M. Science. 2003; 301: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 38Kellis M. Patterson N. Endrizzi M. Birren B. Lander E.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar, 39Basehoar A.D. Zanton S.J. Pugh B.F. Cell. 2004; 116: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Whereas sequences corresponding to open reading frames tend to be near identical between closely related species, non-coding regions are more prone to vary in sequence because of genetic drift. Inspection of the genomic sequence for S. cerevisiae and five related species shows a box of conserved sequence situated ∼100 bases upstream of a conserved ATG codon in all six ZIM17 genes (Fig. 2A). Only in S. cerevisiae is there an upstream ATG sequence that could have served as a start codon, though situated so close to the putative promoter element it would not be included in the transcript made from the ZIM17 gene. The mitochondrial targeting sequences of hundreds of proteins from many species are known, often amino-terminal segments rich in positively charged residues that form two to three turns of a helix with amphipathic character (40von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Predotar is a neural network predictor trained on hundreds of such sequences also validated in tests on simulated genomes (41Lucattini R. Likic V.A. Lithgow T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). If the ATG designated at -93 in Fig. 2A were used as a start codon, the protein made predicts poorly (score = 0.739) as a mitochondrial targeting sequence, whereas the amino-terminal segment of the shorter from of the protein (made from the ATG designated +1) predicts strongly (score = 0.978) as a mitochondrial targeting sequence. In vitro transcription of a construct engineered to have both ATG sequences present drives translation of two protein products: one of ∼33 kDa apparent molecular mass corresponds to the ATG designated -93 (Fig. 2B), and the shorter protein corresponds to the product derived from ATG +1. Only the shorter, ∼23-kDa form binds to deenergized mitochondria in vitro (Fig. 2C). We re-cloned a construct to express only the 23-kDa precursor (starting at ATG +1, see Fig. 2B) for incubation with energized mitochondria, the 23 kDa precursor is imported rapidly and processed to a 17-kDa form (Fig. 2C) corresponding in size to the mature form of Zim17 found in mitochondria.1 When either the 33-kDa (starting at ATG -93) or the 23-kDa (starting at ATG +1) precursor forms of Zim17 were cloned to be under the control of a heterologous promoter and the plasmid transformed into a Δzim17 yeast strain, only the 23-kDa precursor could efficiently maintain viability (data not shown). Zim17 Is a Mitochondrial Matrix Protein—If the ATG (-93) can be used in vivo, the long form of the protein might represent a non-mitochondrial population of protein. To determine whether any non-mitochondrial form of Zim23 exists in vivo, we generated two yeast strains coding for Zim17-GFP. In one, a DNA fragment encoding green fluorescent protein was integrated into chromosome XIV directly behind YNL310c. These cells are viable. In the other, a plasmid-coded form of Zim17-GFP was used to transform heterozygous diploid ZIM17/Δzim17 cells, and after sporulation the Zim17-GFP fusion complements haploid Δzim17 yeast. In each case, analysis by confocal microscopy revealed localization of Zim17-GFP exclusively to mitochondria, confirmed by co-staining with MitoTracker red (Fig. 3A). When mitochondria were isolated and incubated in iso-osmotic buffer in the presence of trypsin, outer membrane proteins like Tom70 were degraded, but Zim17 remained protected from proteolysis (Fig. 3B, lane 3). If trypsin is added to mitochondria in hyperosmotic buffer, where the outer membrane ruptures, proteins like cytochrome b2 in the intermembrane space are degraded by trypsin (lane 4). However only if the inner membrane is permeabilized with the detergent Triton X-100 is Zim17 degraded as is the matrix-located protein Mdj1 (lane 5). Zim17 is not integral in the inner membrane as treatment of mitochondria at pH 11.5 shows Zim17 in the soluble fraction, identical to the matrix protein mtHsp70. Integral membrane proteins, like porin, remain in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3C). Zim17 is exclusively a mitochondrial protein and is located in the matrix. Zim17 Is an Essential Component of the Import Machinery— YNL310c, the gene encoding Zim17, is essential for viability (data not shown) (42Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E. Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H. Davis R.W. Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins that are essential for viability play roles in mitochondrial biogenesis: either protein import (43Baker K.P. Schaniel A. Vestweber D. Schatz G. Nature. 1990; 348: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), Fe-S cluster assembly (44Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), or protein folding (9Voos W. Rottgers K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). To distinguish in which of these processes Zim17 functions, we generated a Δzim17 yeast strain kept alive with a single-copy plasmid encoding Zim17 under the control of the glucose-repressible GAL promoter. This Zim17↓ strain grows on media containing galactose (Fig. 4A) or lactate (data not shown) as a carbon source, but is inviable on media containing glucose (Fig. 4A). A culture of Zim17↓ cells grown on media containing galactose was split in two with one half resuspended in fresh media containing galactose (Zim17↑) and the other resuspended in media containing glucose (Zim17↓). After 4 h of culture, mitochondria were purified and assayed for endogenous protein levels, which were similar under either growth condition (Fig. 4B). The Zim17↓ cells remain viable for at least 16 h on glucose medium (data not shown). To test if depletion of Zim17 has an effect on import of precursor proteins, mitochondria purified from cultures of Zim17↑ or Zim17↓ cells. To minimize indirect effects, cells were isolated from the cultures after only 4 h on either galactose or glucose and mitochondria were purified and assayed for protein import in vitro (Fig. 5A). Import that involves the TIM23 complex was decreased in Zim17-depleted mitochondria; the precursor proteins Su9-DHFR, a fusion protein consisting of the presequence of subunit 9 of F1F0-ATPase from Neurospora crassa and mouse dihydrofolate reductase and chaperonin 10 (Cpn10) are shown as examples for import into the matrix. Comparison of the amount imported at each time point shows the rate of import into mitochondria from the Zim17↓ cells is ∼25% of the rate into mitochondria deplete with Zim17. Approximately 2-fold decreased import rates were observed for cytochrome b2, which is processed for the intermembrane space only after translocation of its mitochondrial targeting sequence into the matrix (30Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Muller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Import of inner membrane proteins like the phosphate carrier (PiC) and the ADP-ATP carrier (AAC1) that depend on the TIM22 translocase were not affected. Likewise, the rate of insertion of porin into the outer membrane remained unchanged in mitochondria from Zim17↓ cells. As an initial assessment of whether Zim17 can interact with unfolded precursor proteins, we expressed in Escherichia coli and purified both Zim17-GST 2The abbreviation used is: GST, glutathione S-transferase. and GST. Immobilized on glutathione agarose beads, GST and Zim17-GST were incubated with mitochondrial preproteins synthesized by in vitro translation: both cytochrome c1 and Su9-DHFR bound to Zim17-GST significantly better than either did to GST alone (Fig. 5B). Tim14/Pam18 and Tim44 Are Potential Partners of Zim17— J-proteins form only transient complexes with the substrates they assist in collaboration with Hsp70 partners, and our initial attempts either to co-purify partners of Zim17 or to stabilize transient complexes with substrate via chemical cross-linking have been unsuccessful (data not shown). We reasoned, however, that overexpression of even transient partners to Zim17 might stabilize its presence in the matrix after shutdown of expression in the Zim17↓ strain. Fig. 6 shows a drop-test dilution series of Zim17↓ cells transformed with multicopy plasmids for each of the indicated components of the protein import machinery. The vector only control shows the Zim17↓ cells can not divide sufficient times to form colonies on the plates with glucose as a carbon source. A plasmid with YNL310c under constitutive control maintains cell viability and the cells (Zim17) remain viable and divide to form large colonies. Overexpression of the inner-membrane J-protein Tim14/Pam18 or Tim44, a peripheral component of the TIM23 complex, can each maintain cell viability long enough that these cells form visible colonies. This does not represent redundancy in function between Zim17 and Pam18/Tim14 or Tim44 because the cells in these small colonies are inviable (data not shown). Rather, extra copies of either Pam18/Tim14 or Tim44 seem to prolong the time for which Zim17 can still function after expression of the YNL310c gene is shut down. A relatively small but reproducible suppression was also seen with the gene encoding the channel subunit Tim23, and matrix-exposed regions of each of the subunits of the TIM23 complex might be able to stabilize Zim17 levels after shut down of the ZIM17 gene. Neither overexpression of the genes encoding mtHsp70, the J-like protein Pam16/Tim16, nor the J-protein Mdj2 prolong the viability of the Zim17↓ strain on glucose media. The plasmid overexpressing the matrix J-protein Mdj1 partially suppresses the growth defects for Zim17↓ cells shifted onto growth medium containing glucose (Fig. 6). It might be that the zinc finger domain of Mdj1 can overlap functionally for lost Zim17, albeit with reduced effectiveness. Three classes of J-proteins have been identified, distinguished by their domain structures (25Walsh P. Bursac D. Law Y.C. Cyr D. Lithgow T. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 45Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). All three classes of J-proteins have the signature J-domain for interaction with a Hsp70 partner, but Type I J-proteins also have a zinc finger domain and carboxyl-terminal domain, whereas Type II J-proteins have only the additional carboxyl-terminal domain. The Type I and Type II J-proteins use these ancillary domains to bind non-native substrate polypeptide and assist it in eventually attaining a native structure and are thereby considered molecular chaperones (3Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Type III J-proteins are not molecular chaperones in their own right, given their inability to bind substrate polypeptides. A recent survey of the yeast genome revealed that yeast express 22 J-proteins, of which 13 fall into the Type III category (25Walsh P. Bursac D. Law Y.C. Cyr D. Lithgow T. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Type III J-proteins can stimulate ATP hydrolysis in their partner Hsp70 yet alone would be incapable of delivering substrate or serving to couple ATP hydrolysis with substrate binding. In isolation, the zinc finger domain from DnaJ forms an extended β-hairpin structure, exposing negatively charged patches and a single hydrophobic groove, and the isolated domain can bind hydrophobic peptides derived from substrate proteins (46Martinez-Yamout M. Legge G.B. Zhang O. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, given the limited binding of peptides and larger substrates observed for both the zinc finger domain from DnaJ and from the yeast homolog Ydj1, it seems likely that the zinc finger domain normally co-operates with other domains of DnaJ to load non-native substrates onto a Hsp70 partner (5Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 6Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 46Martinez-Yamout M. Legge G.B. Zhang O. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We propose that Zim17 is a partner of the Type III J-protein Pam18/Tim14 and that together they represent a fractured J-protein with the J-domain of Pam18/Tim14 being complemented in trans by a substrate-binding domain in Zim17. We do not exclude a previous suggestion that substrate binding surfaces in subunits of the TIM23 complex, in particular provided by Tim44, might also contribute to loading substrates onto the mitochondrial Hsp70 (19Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The substrate binding domains of Type I J-proteins like Ydj1 and Mdj1 are around 35 kDa, including the zinc finger and additional carboxyl-terminal domain, and additional domains might collaborate with the zinc finger domain of Zim17 to assist mtHsp70 in binding substrate. In this context we note the small but reproducible increase in levels of Tim44 that occur in response to the decreased levels of Zim17 in the shut-down strain (Fig. 4). Of the 800 or so proteins that are targeted to mitochondria, it is likely that approximately half are imported into the matrix via the TIM23 complex. The steps in this import pathway are becoming clear. Precursor proteins are made in the cytosol, are recognized by the receptors of the TOM complex for insertion into the channel formed by the Tom40 subunit, and are passed onto domains of the TIM23 complex exposed in the intermembrane space (7Jensen R.E. Johnson A.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R779-R782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 47Chacinska A. Rehling P. Guiard B. Frazier A.E. Schulze-Specking A. Pfanner N. Voos W.

Cell. 1996; 87: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of the precursor is then inserted into the TIM23 complex, presumably crossing the inner membrane via a tightly gated channel of the complex (50Koehler C.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 51Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Neupert W. Brunner M.

The peripheral subunit of the TIM23 complex, Tim44, serves as a docking point for mtHsp70 (54Merlin A. Voos W. Maarse A.C. Meijer M. Pfanner N. Rassow J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The extended, translocating polypeptide chain is taken up into the substrate-binding pocket of mtHsp70, and it is at this stage that we propose Zim17 acts by assisting the loading of substrate onto mtHsp70 in an analogous way to the loading of substrates by Type I J-proteins. The J-domain from Pam18/Tim14 interacts with the ATPase domain of mtHsp70, and multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis by mtHsp70 effectively displace the substrate from the TIM23 complex segmentally. Interactions made between Hsp70 chaperones and their J-protein partners are transient, and in the case of the proposed interaction between mtHsp70 and Zim17 we have been unable to stabilize any putative “complex” with either substrate polypeptide or chemical cross-linking agents. Nor have we been able to cross-link Zim17 to the Pam18/Tim14, Tim44, or Tim23 subunits of the translocation complex. Being unable to show a direct interaction of Zim17 with subunits of the import motor, we can not dismiss the possibility that Zim17 might also act at a later stage of peptide translocation, assisting in the Mdj1-driven loading of substrate onto mtHsp70 for protein folding. Like Pam18/Tim14 (19Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4945-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), Zim17 appears to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes suggesting that the modular nature of this fractured J-protein is a fundamental feature of the protein import motor. Although it remains speculation, the fractured arrangement of a Pam18/Tim14-Zim17 J-protein might assist in shedding mtHsp70 from the TIM23 complex, with Zim17 then being replaced by Mdj1 to initiate substrate-loading onto mtHsp70 and coupled ATP hydrolysis. For some substrates, the chaperone activity of mtHsp70 is sufficient to finalize folding of the substrate, whereas in many cases the partially folded substrate is then passed onto the chaperonin complex made up of Cpn10 and Cpn60 (55Rospert S. Looser R. Dubaquie Y. Matouschek A. Glick B.S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For both translocation into the matrix and folding of imported substrates mtHsp70 also depends on the ADP-ATP exchange co-factor Mge1, a homolog of bacterial GrpE (9Voos W. Rottgers K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 56Laloraya S. Gambill B.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fractured J-proteins might be more widespread and found in other subcellular compartments. Another zinc finger domain with sequence similarity to that of Type I J-proteins was found in Hua1, a cytoplasmic protein that plays a role in actin patch assembly. The assembly and disassembly of actin and actin-related proteins in oligomeric patches might well be a job for Hsp70 in the cytosol, and one of the three type III J-proteins in the cytosol (Jjj1, Jjj2, or Jjj3 (25Walsh P. Bursac D. Law Y.C. Cyr D. Lithgow T. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar)) might function in trans with Hua1 to modulate assembly and disassembly of parts of the actin cytoskeleton.

https://openalex.org/W2020097016,"The assembly of von Willebrand factor multimers in the Golgi apparatus requires D1D2 domains of the von Willebrand factor propeptide, which may act as an oxidoreductase to promote disulfide bond formation or rearrangement between two D3 domains in the mature subunit.

This intermediate rearranged in the Golgi to form free propeptide and D′D3 dimers that were secreted. A similar intracellular disulfide-linked species was identified in cells expressing the propeptide and D′D3 as separate proteins and in cells expressing full-length von Willebrand factor.

Von Willebrand factor (VWF) 1The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; BHK, baby hamster kidney; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; endo H, endoglycosidase H. is a multimeric plasma glycoprotein that is required for hemostasis because it binds to connective tissue exposed at sites of injury and then binds to receptors on the platelet surface, initiating the formation of a platelet plug. To perform its role in hemostasis, VWF must be assembled into large multimers before secretion into the blood (1Wagner D.D. Marder V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2065-2067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular assembly of VWF presents a challenge to the cell because VWF can form multimers as large as 4 μm in length and 40,000 kDa in mass (2Fowler W.E. Fretto L.J. Hamilton K.K. Erickson H.P. McKee P.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which may be too large for vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi (3Rivera V.M. Wang X. Wardwell S. Courage N.L. Volchuk A. Keenan T. Holt D.A. Gilman M. Orci L. Cerasoli F.J. Rothman J.E. Clackson T. Science. 2000; 287: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To overcome this size limitation, VWF has evolved a unique mechanism of assembly whereby disulfide-linked VWF dimers form in the ER and the multimerization event is postponed until the Golgi compartment. VWF is synthesized and secreted by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes (Fig. 1) (4Jaffe E.A. Hoyer L.W. Nachman R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1906-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 5Nachman R. Levine R. Jaffe E.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1977; 60: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the ER, VWF forms disulfide-linked dimers between two cystine knot (CK) domains in a tail-to-tail orientation (6Wagner D.D. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 7Wagner D.D. Fay P.J. Sporn L.A. Sinha S. Lawrence S.O. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25585-25594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). VWF dimers are transported to the Golgi where they form very large multimers, and furin cleaves the propeptide (D1D2) (10Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VWF multimers assemble in a head-to-head orientation between juxtaposed D3 domains (6Wagner D.D. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 7Wagner D.D. Fay P.J. Sporn L.A. Sinha S. Lawrence S.O. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, VWF multimers are linked by disulfide bonds, which form or rearrange in the Golgi (6Wagner D.D. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1994; 83: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disulfide bond formation usually is restricted to the ER where the neutral pH and necessary oxidoreductase enzymes promote the process (for review, see Ref. 12Frand A.R. Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 203-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The Golgi is a hostile environment for disulfide bond formation or rearrangement due to its acidic nature and its lack of chaperones and oxidoreductases. Nevertheless, the lower pH of the Golgi appears to be required for VWF multimerization because raising the pH of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or monensin inhibits VWF multimerization (13Wagner D.D. Mayadas T. Urban-Pickering M. Lewis B.H. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Wagner D.D. Mayadas T. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Using partially purified pro-VWF, multimerization in vitro was reconstituted at pH 5.8 but not at neutral or basic pH (15Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13497-13503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome the lower pH and the lack of oxidoreductase enzymes in the Golgi, VWF appears to employ its own propeptide as an oxidoreductase to promote the rearrangement or formation of the disulfide bonds linking VWF multimers. Deletion of the VWF propeptide prevents multimerization (16Verweij C.L. Hart M. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Wise R.J. Pittman D.D. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 229-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The VWF propeptide contains two CXXC motifs, which is the signature active site sequence of oxidoreductase family members. When the spacing of this sequence was altered by the insertion of a glycine residue, thus changing CXXC to CXGXC, multimerization was inhibited (18Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). If the VWF propeptide functions as an oxidoreductase to facilitate VWF multimerization, then the VWF propeptide should form a transient disulfide-linked intermediate with the multimerization region of VWF before multimer formation. In this study such an intermediate was identified in a C-terminal-truncated VWF model system and also in full-length recombinant VWF. Thus, the VWF propeptide may act as a unique oxidoreductase to promote VWF multimerization in the Golgi apparatus. Description of Constructs—All plasmids encoding fragments of human VWF were derived from pSVHVWF1.1 (19Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSVH-D3-FLAGNT/c-MycCT contains the coding region for the VWF signal peptide and domains D1D2D′D3 of VWF (corresponding to amino acids 1–1241). A FLAG tag (DYKDADDDK) was inserted immediately after the signal peptide cleavage site between residue Cys22 and Ala23 using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-g cca ggg acc ctt tgt gat tac aag gat gat gat gat aag gca gaa gga act cgc g-3′. By the same method a c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) and a stop codon were added to the C-terminal end of the D3 domain after VWF residue Gly1241 using the synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-cc tgc cag gag ccg gga gaa cag aaa ctg att tca gaa gaa gac ctg tga gat atc ggc tgc tgc-3′. Plasmid pSVH-propeptide-FLAGNT contains the coding region for the VWF signal peptide and domains D1D2 of VWF (corresponding to amino acid residues 1–763) followed by a stop codon. A FLAG tag was inserted immediately after the signal peptide cleavage site between Cys22 and Ala23 as described above. Plasmid pSVH-D′D3Δpro-c-Myc contains the signal peptide of VWF followed by domains D′D3 of VWF (corresponding to amino acid residues 1–33 and 764–1220). A c-Myc epitope tag was appended to the C-terminal end of the D3 domain after Gly1241 as described above. Cell Culture—Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient Transfection of BHK Cells—BHK cells were transiently transfected with pSVH-D′D3-c-MycCT and/or pSVH-propeptide-FLAGNT using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—BHK-fur4-D1D2D′D3-FLAGNT-c-MycCT stable cells were generated by cotransfecting BHK-fur4 cells (20Bodo I. Katsumi A. Tuley E.A. Eikenboom J.C. Dong Z. Sadler J.E. Blood. 2001; 98: 2973-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with pRSV-neo and pSVH-D1D2D′D3-FLAGNT-c-MycCT. Selection for individual Geneticin-resistant clones was carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 900 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Metabolic Labeling of Cells—BHK cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine. Cells were labeled with 300 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (ICN Biomedical Research Products) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine for either 15 min or 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) plus 50.4 μg/ml unlabeled l-cystine and 15 μg/ml unlabeled l-methionine for the indicated times. Trapping Intracellular Mixed Disulfide Species—Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (Pierce). Cells were lysed in 0.6% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 144 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1:1000 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 40 mm NEM. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitations were performed using a 1:10 dilution (v/v) of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) and a 1:100 dilution (v/v) of monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma), a 1:100 dilution (v/v) of monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody 9E10 (Sigma), or a 1:100 dilution (v/v) of the rabbit polyclonal anti-human VWF antibody 082 (DAKO). Protein G-Sepharose-antibody-antigen complexes were washed 3 times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NEM, 0.02% sodium azide. For Western blotting samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–15% Tris-HCl gradient gels (Bio-Rad), and transferred by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% casein to prevent nonspecific binding. Membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight with either 1:2000 (v/v) dilution of FLAG M2-HRP antibody (Sigma) or 1:1000 (v/v) dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-human VWF (P226, DAKO). Membranes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and developed using the chemiluminescent ECL kit protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Protease Digestion of VWF—VWF bound to 082 antibody-protein G-Sepharose was digested with 10 μm human α-thrombin (Hematologic Technologies, Inc.) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm CaCl2, 40 mm NEM for 2 h at room temperature. Thrombin was inactivated with 50 μm PPACK for 15 min at room temperature. Digestion with recombinant human furin (Sigma) was performed using 20 units of furin in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, 40 mm NEM for 2 h at 37 °C. Furin was inactivated using 2 mm EDTA for 5 min at room temperature. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer without reducing agent (Bio-Rad) and electrophoresed on 4–15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad). Lanes were cut from the gel and incubated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 65 °C. Lane strips were incubated at 65 °C for 30 min in 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue. Reduced gel strips were placed horizontally into the preparative well of a 4–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and electrophoresed. Products were visualized by autoradiography. Glycosidase Digestions—Samples were heated to 100 °C in 0.5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min. Endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) from Streptomyces plicatus was used at a final concentration of 20,000 units/ml. Endoglycosidase H reactions were performed in 100 mm sodium citrate/phosphate, pH 5.5, 0.16% SDS, 1.67% β-mercaptoethanol, 1.6% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 16 h. N-Glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) from Flavobacterium meningosepticum was used at a final concentration of 20,000 units/ml. N-Glycosidase F reactions were performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.16% SDS, 1.67% β-mercaptoethanol, 1.6% Triton X-100, 0.02% sodium azide at 37 °C for 16 h. C-terminal-truncated VWF Forms Disulfide-linked Dimers in the Golgi Apparatus—The mechanism of VWF multimerization can be difficult to study in detail due to the size and complexity of the multimers that are produced. Fortunately, VWF dimerization and multimerization can be studied independently in simpler model systems (21Voorberg J. Fontijn R. van Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 797-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The construct FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc encodes VWF residues 1–1241 with a FLAG tag at the N terminus and a c-Myc tag at the C terminus. When this VWF truncation was expressed in BHK cells, both D′D3-c-Myc monomer (∼55 kDa) and disulfide-linked D′D3-c-Myc dimer (∼110 kDa) were secreted (Fig. 2A, lane 2) together with the cleaved monomeric 80 kDa FLAG-propeptide (Fig. 2A, lane 5). These results show that VWF truncated after domain D3 reproduces the disulfide-dependent multimerization and propeptide cleavage of full-length VWF. In cell lysates the FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc protein was present as a full-length monomer, with no detectable cleaved propeptide or D′D3 fragments under non-reducing (Fig. 2C) or reducing conditions (Fig. 2D). Both furin cleavage of the VWF propeptide and formation of interchain disulfide bonds between D3 domains occur in the trans-Golgi (6Wagner D.D. Marder V.J. J.

Blood. 1994; 83: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the transit through the ER usually is the rate-limiting step in protein secretion (22Lodish H.F. Kong N. Snider M. Strous G.J. Nature. 1983; 304: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, intracellular D1D2D′D3 monomers probably are biosynthetic intermediates located in the ER. The VWF propeptide is necessary for VWF multimerization (16Verweij C.L. Hart M. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2885-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Wise R.J. Pittman D.D. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 229-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and when the D′D3-c-Myc region of VWF was expressed in the absence of the propeptide, only D′D3-c-Myc monomers were secreted (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The VWF propeptide also can promote multimerization when it is expressed on a separate plasmid from the mature VWF subunit (17Wise R.J. Pittman D.D. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 229-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc were expressed on separate plasmids, both D′D3-c-Myc monomers and disulfide-linked dimers were secreted (Fig. 2A, lane 3). These results confirm the essential role of the propeptide in VWF multimerization and validate the use of truncated VWF constructs to study the multimerization process. Propeptide and D′D3 Form an Intrachain Disulfide-bonded Complex in the ER—If VWF forms multimers by an oxidoreductase mechanism, then a transient disulfide-linked complex should form between the propeptide and the D′D3 region of VWF before multimerization. To address this question, BHK cells expressing FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, and a full-length intracellular species was immunopurified from the cell lysates (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3). Thrombin is known to cleave pro-VWF at the furin cleavage site between the propeptide and mature VWF (15Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13497-13503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at Arg-636 in the D2 domain (23Fay P.J. Chavin S.I. Schroeder D. Young F.E. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7200-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When the immunopurified FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc was digested with thrombin, bands of 55, 80, and 120 kDa were observed, corresponding to the expected sizes for the D′D3 fragment, the propeptide, and a disulfide-linked propeptide-D′D3 complex, respectively (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The 120-kDa species disappeared upon reduction, which is consistent with its proposed composition (Fig. 3A, lane 4). These conclusions were confirmed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE of thrombin-treated and untreated FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc when separated under non-reducing conditions in the first dimension and reducing conditions in the second dimension (Fig. 3B). The undigested FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc migrated as a 120-kDa protein under non-reducing conditions and as a ∼140-kDa protein under reducing conditions (Fig. 3B, left panel). Therefore, the intracellular FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc protein contains only intrachain disulfide bonds. Additionally, this result confirms that the majority of the intracellular FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc protein is monomeric and contains the N-terminal propeptide. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE of thrombin-treated FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc showed that the 120-kDa species consisted of disulfide-linked 100-kDa propeptide and 65-kDa D′D3 (Fig. 3B, right panel), as predicted by the one-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis. This same species was observed when the FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc was treated with furin (data not shown). Additionally, upon reduction, the 80-kDa species gave rise to fragments of 75- and 25-kDa, consistent with cleavage of the propeptide by thrombin after Arg-636 (23Fay P.J. Chavin S.I. Schroeder D. Young F.E. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7200-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ∼55-kDa species gave rise to a single product after reduction, as expected for D′D3. Thus, intracellular D1D2D′D3 consists mainly of full-length 120-kDa monomers, some of which contain intrachain disulfide bonds between the propeptide and D′D3 region. The intracellular localization of D1D2D′D3 was investigated by endoglycosidase digestion (Fig. 3C). The N-linked oligosaccharides of intracellular FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc protein were sensitive to either endoglycosidase H or N-glycosidase F (Fig. 3C, top panel), indicating the presence of high mannose structures typical of proteins in the ER. In contrast, the N-linked oligosaccharides on secreted FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc were resistant to endoglycosidase H (Fig. 3C, bottom panel), consistent with processing to complex structures in the Golgi before secretion. These data indicate that the intrachain disulfide bonds form in the ER between the propeptide and D′D3 regions of D1D2D′D3, and these disulfide bonds rearrange in the Golgi apparatus to yield free propeptide and D′D3 dimers. This progression supports an oxidoreductase mechanism for VWF multimer assembly. FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc Domains Form an SDS-resistant Complex in the ER When They Are Co-expressed on Separate Plasmids—Previous work by Wise et al. (17Wise R.J. Pittman D.D. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 229-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) demonstrated an intracellular disulfide-bonded complex between the propeptide and mature VWF subunit when the propeptide and the mature VWF subunit were co-expressed on separate plasmids. A similar result was observed when FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc were co-expressed in BHK cells radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Fig. 4). When lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-FLAG antibody or anti-c-Myc antibody and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, both the 100-kDa FLAG-propeptide and the 65-kDa D′D3-c-Myc protein were co-purified (Fig. 4A). The specificity of the immunoprecipitations was confirmed with BHK cells expressing either FLAG-propeptide or D′D3-c-Myc. As expected, anti-FLAG did not recognize D′D3-c-Myc (Fig. 4A, lane 1), and anti-c-Myc did not recognize FLAG-propeptide (Fig. 4A, lane 6). Both antibodies gave rise to a variable nonspecific band at ∼70 kDa that was also seen in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8). Therefore, the FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc interact intracellularly even when expressed as independent polypeptides. To determine whether the FLAG-propeptide and the D′D3-c-Myc proteins are connected covalently or non-covalently, the lysates from the FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc co-expression were heated to 100 °C in the presence of 1% SDS and sequentially immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc antibody and anti-FLAG antibody in either order. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE without reduction, the purified proteins consisted of high molecular weight species, most of which barely entered the gel (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). Under reducing conditions the high molecular weight species were found to contain the 100-kDa FLAG-propeptide and the 65-kDa D′D3-c-Myc protein (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). When quantitated by densitometry, the ratio of FLAG-propeptide to D′D3-c-Myc was one-to-one. The N-linked oligosaccharides on the intracellular, FLAG-propeptide, and the D′D3-c-Myc proteins were endo H-sensitive (Fig. 4C, top panel), consistent with their localization in the ER. In contrast, the oligosaccharides on the secreted proteins were endo H-resistant, consistent with processing in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4C, bottom panel). These data indicate that even when expressed as separate proteins, FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc form disulfide-linked stoichiometric complexes in the ER. The FLAG-propeptide-D′D3-c-Myc Disulfide-bonded Complex Rearranges in the Golgi to Form D′D3 Dimer and Free Propeptide—After a 24-h chase period, radiolabeled FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc were secreted from cells co-expressing both proteins (Fig. 5). No disulfide-linked complex between the propeptide and D′D3 was observed; instead, immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG yielded only monomeric FLAG-propeptide (Fig. 5A, lane 4), and immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Myc yielded only monomeric and dimeric D′D3 (Fig. 5A, lane 3). These data for pulse-labeled proteins are consistent with the behavior of the unlabeled FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the FLAG-propeptide-D′D3-c-Myc disulfide-linked complex rearranges in the Golgi to produce D′D3-c-Myc dimer and monomer. Full-length VWF Forms a Disulfide-bonded Complex with the Propeptide in the ER—The significance of this intracellular complex is supported by the identification of a similar intermediate during the biosynthesis of full-length VWF (Fig. 6). Radiolabeled VWF was immunopurified from BHK cell lysate, and a portion was digested with thrombin to cleave between the VWF propeptide and the mature subunit. When the undigested VWF was analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, VWF had an apparent mass greater than 600 kDa under non-reducing conditions, decreasing to ∼350 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 6A, top panel), which is expected behavior for pro-VWF dimers composed of ∼350-kDa subunits linked by disulfide bonds at their C termini. After digestion with thrombin, the majority of the intracellular full-length VWF continued to migrate as a ∼600-kDa species under nonreducing conditions, but upon reduction it gave rise to components of ∼250 and 80 kDa, the size expected for mature VWF subunit and propeptide, respectively (Fig. 6A, bottom panel). Similar results were observed when the intracellular full-length VWF was treated with furin and analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (data not shown). As observed for recombinant VWF fragments (Fig. 3 and 4), the oligosaccharides of intracellular full-length VWF were endo H-sensitive, whereas those of secreted VWF were endo H-resistant (Fig. 6B). These results show that the VWF propeptide forms a disulfide-linked complex with the mature subunit of VWF in the endoplasmic reticulum before the multimerization of full-length VWF. The Propeptide-D′D3 Covalent Species Appears to Be an Authentic Intermediate of VWF Biosynthesis—Pulse-chase analysis (Fig. ) indicates that the majority of the intracellular FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc is eventually secreted. The cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 15 min and chased in media containing unlabeled methionine and cystine. For each time point, intracellular FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc and secreted FLAG-propeptide and secreted D′D3-c-Myc proteins were immunoprecipitated quantitatively and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The intracellular FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc level decreased over the time course (Fig. 7, A and B). Additionally, similar analysis of the secreted FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc monomer and dimer levels revealed a concomitant rise in the extracellular level of these proteins (Fig. 7, A and B). In all cases, the immunoprecipitations were quantitative since re-immunoprecipitation of the supernatants with other specific monoclonal antibodies gave no additional signal (data not shown). In general, efficient secretion of both the FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc proteins was observed over the time course. By 24 h all of the FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc protein had exited the cell and appeared as free FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc monomer and D′D3-c-Myc dimer protein. Similar results were observed when the time course was repeated in the presence of lactacystin (data not shown), indicating the FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc protein is not targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Thus, the FLAG-propeptide-D′D3-c-Myc disulfide-bonded complex is an authentic biosynthetic intermediate of VWF biosynthesis that rearranges in the Golgi to yield secreted FLAG-propeptide and D′D3-c-Myc monomer and dimer. VWF assembles into disulfide-linked multimers in the Golgi apparatus using a unique mechanism that depends on the presence of the N-terminal propeptide (6Wagner D.D. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2123-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1994; 83: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Verweij C.L. Hart M. Pannekoek H.

Cell. 1988; 52: 229-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because the Golgi has an acidic pH and lacks oxidoreductases, the mechanism of VWF multimerization provides an interesting example of disulfide bond formation in a relatively harsh environment. Evidence presented in this study suggests that the propeptide of VWF may be an internal, VWF-specific oxidoreductase that acts only under the conditions of the Golgi environment to promote VWF multimerization. The oxidoreductase model predicts that the VWF propeptide should form a disulfide-linked intermediate with the D′D3 region of VWF before multimerization in the Golgi apparatus. In this study the VWF propeptide was shown to form a disulfide-bonded intermediate with the mature VWF subunit in the ER (Fig. 6). The D′D3 region of VWF was sufficient to form this intermediate with the VWF propeptide (Figs. 3B and 4B), localizing the disulfide bonds for forming the disulfide-bonded intermediate to the multimerization region of VWF. The propeptide-D′D3 disulfide-bonded intermediate was observed only in cell lysates and was not secreted (Fig. 5). Additionally, as the level of intracellular propeptide-D′D3 disulfide-linked complex decreased, the levels of the secreted free propeptide and D′D3 disulfide-linked dimer increased (Fig. 7). Similar results observed in the presence of lactacystin (data not shown) indicate this complex is not targeted for degradation via the proteasome. These data suggest that the propeptide-D′D3 disulfide-linked complex leads directly to the formation of VWF multimers and suggests the VWF propeptide may function via an oxidoreductase mechanism. The propeptide-D′D3 disulfide-linked species was present in cell lysates at a relatively low abundance when compared with the amount of free propeptide and free D′D3. This finding is not surprising since most disulfide-linked intermediates are relatively unstable, transient species (24Gitler C. Zarmi B. Kalef E. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Indeed, in our hands, identifying this intermediate depended on the addition of the membrane permeable alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide before cell lysis to prevent disulfide rearrangement. 2A. R. Purvis and J. Evan Sadler, unpublished observation. The sensitivity to reduction and transient nature of the propeptide-D′D3 disulfide-linked intermediate may explain why this species was not identified in previous studies of VWF multimerization (15Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13497-13503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wagner et al. (15Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13497-13503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that free thiols are required for VWF multimerization because isolated pro-VWF dimers failed to form multimers in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide. Further studies to determine the location of these mechanistically important thiols will be necessary to fully understand the role of the propeptide in VWF multimerization. Notably, a difference in thrombin sensitivity was observed between the propeptide that is disulfide-bonded to the D′D3 region of VWF and the propeptide not in disulfide-bonded complex with the D′D3 region of VWF. This difference in thrombin cleavage pattern is apparent when observing the thrombin-digested FLAG-D1D2D′D3-c-Myc two-dimensional SDS-PAGE data (Fig. 3B). The 80-kDa propeptide that is not in a disulfide-bonded complex with the D′D3 region is cleaved at the thrombin cleavage site after Arg-636 described by Fay et al. (23Fay P.J. Chavin S.I. Schroeder D. Young F.E. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7200-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and dissociates under reducing conditions into species of ∼70 and ∼25 kDa. In contrast, propeptide disulfide-bonded to D′D3 is resistant to thrombin, suggesting that the thrombin cleavage site within the propeptide is inaccessible within the propeptide-D′D3 covalent complex. In addition to the disulfide-linked intermediate between the propeptide and D′D3 region of VWF, various non-covalent interactions are likely to play an essential role in VWF multimerization. For example, the VWF propeptide has been shown to form non-covalent homodimers at neutral pH (7Wagner D.D. Fay P.J. Sporn L.A. Sinha S. Lawrence S.O. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1994; 83: 3536-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but to dissociate at acidic pH and bind instead to VWF multimers (7Wagner D.D. Fay P.J. Sporn L.A. Sinha S. Lawrence S.O. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, propeptide-propeptide interactions in the neutral environment of the ER may bring two D3 domains close together and position them for structural rearrangement and multimerization upon arrival in the acidic Golgi. These pH-sensitive non-covalent interactions between the propeptide and D′D3 region may explain in part how VWF multimerization is postponed until the acidic environment of the Golgi apparatus.

We show that the glucosyltransferase domain of lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii (LTcyt; amino acids 1–546), which is released into the cytosol during cell infection, binds preferentially to liposomes containing phosphatidylserine as compared with other anionic lipids. The binding of LTcyt to phosphatidylserine increases by two orders of magnitude the rate of glucosylation of liposome-bound geranyl-geranylated Rac-GDP. Limited proteolysis and deletion studies show that the binding site for phosphatidylserine lies within the first 18 N-terminal residues of LTcyt. Deletion of these residues abolishes the effect of phosphatidylserine on the activity of LTcyt on liposome-bound geranyl-geranylated Rac-GDP and prevents the morphological effects induced by LTcyt microinjection into various cells, but it does not affect the intrinsic activity of LTcyt on non-geranyl-geranylated Rac-GDP in solution.

The targets of C. difficile toxins A and B are members of the Rho/Rac/Cdc42 family, a small G protein subfamily that plays a critical role in the control of cell morphology. The spectrum of LT partially overlaps that of C. difficile toxins. LT glucosylates Rac but also members of the Ras subfamily (Ras, Ral, and Rap) (2Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E.

In all cases the toxin acts as a glucosyltransferase, catalyzing the transfer of a glucosyl group from a nucleotide sugar (usually UDP-glucose) to a conserved threonine residue. This threonine (Thr-35 in Rac) participates in the coordination of the nucleotide, belongs to one of the two switch regions that undergo a conformational change upon GDP/GTP exchange and GTP hydrolysis, and is involved in effector binding. Threonine glucosylation prevents the interaction of the small G protein with effector molecules and interferes with the catalysis of GDP/GTP exchange and GTP hydrolysis by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (4Sehr P.

The 500-amino acid C-terminal domain is involved in the specific recognition of cell surface receptors. After endocytosis, a central hydrophobic domain penetrates through the endosome membrane in a pH-dependent manner and drives the translocation of the N-terminal domain from the lumenal side to the cytosolic side (8Qa'Dan M.

The members of the Rho family are geranylgeranylated at their C terminus and, as such, interact with lipid membranes. Alternatively, the members form a soluble 1:1 complex with GDI, a protein that masks the geranyl-geranylated group. RhoA in complex with GDI is not a substrate for glucosylation by toxin B from C. difficile (13Genth H. Aktories K. Just I. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10007-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Considering the binary partitioning of Rho proteins between lipid membranes and GDI, it is therefore likely that only membrane-bound Rho proteins should be substrates for large clostridial toxins. This hypothesis was tested here using geranyl-geranylated Rac bound to liposomes of defined lipid composition. We show that because of a specific phosphatidylserine-binding site located in the first 18 residues, the cytosolic fragment of lethal toxin glucosylates liposome-bound prenylated Rac-GDP very efficiently when the lipid bilayer displays a composition approaching that of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Moreover, deletion of this N-terminal site abolishes the cytotoxic effects of LT observed in vivo. Lipids and Reagents—Liver phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), brain phosphatidylserine (PS), liver phosphatidylinositol (PI), brain phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG), cholesterol, and synthetic lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidic acid (PA) were from Sigma. [14C]UDP-glucose was from Amersham Biosciences. Protein Expression and Purification—Full-length LT was produced and purified from strain IP 82 as described (17Popoff M.R. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 35-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments corresponding to amino acids 1–546 of LTcyt, 19–546 of [Δ18]LTcyt, 1852–2366 of LT, and 1–546 of C. difficile toxin B were cloned in a pET28 vector (Merck-Novagen). This vector adds a hexahistidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site at the N terminus. The constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel chromatography. In typical glucosylation and liposome binding experiments we observed that removal of the hexahistidine tag with thrombin did not modify the properties of LTcyt. Therefore, for most experiments the hexahistidine tag was not removed. The complex between GDI (with an N-terminal FLAG) and geranylgeranylated Rac1-GDP (with an N-terminal His6 tag) was expressed in yeast cells and purified by affinity chromatography as described (18Read P.W. Nakamoto R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 15-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Non-prenylated human Rac1-GDP was expressed in E. coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion and purified using glutathione-agarose beads followed by glutathione S-transferase cleavage. Liposome Preparation—Stock solutions of lipids in chloroform were mixed in a 20 ml pear-shaped glass container. The fluorescent lipid nitrobenzoxadiazol-PE was added at 1 mol % as a tracer. The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The lipid film was resuspended in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 180 mm sucrose. After five cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing in a water bath (30 °C), the liposome suspension was extruded 21 times through a 0.4-μm poresized polycarbonate filter using a mini-extruder from Avanti Polar Lipids. External sucrose was eliminated by dilution in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 100 mm KCl and by centrifugation (400,000 × g for 15 min at 25 °C). The liposomes were resuspended at a final lipid concentration of 10 mm in the same buffer and stored under argon at room temperature before use. Liposome Binding Experiments—Protein and liposomes were mixed at a final concentration of 1 μm and 3 mm, respectively, in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm MnCl2 (total volume 50 μl). After 5 min at 30 °C, the sample was centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 20 min. The lipid pellet was resuspended in the same volume of buffer. Proteins in the pellet and in the supernatant were visualized by Sypro Orange staining after SDS-PAGE using a fluorescence imaging system (LAS 3000, Fujifilm). As a control, a centrifugation experiment was performed in the absence of liposomes to determine the background level of protein, which sediments. Only experiments in which this level was <5% were considered. Therefore, the liposome binding values reported here are significant over the 5–100% range. GDI Removal Protocol—The complex between GDI and Rac-GDP (1 μm) was incubated for 40 min at 30 °C with liposomes (6 mm lipids) and 20 μm GTP in buffer A supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm EDTA to give a [Mg2+]free of 1 μm. The sample was centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with cold buffer A ([Mg2+]free = 1 μm), centrifuged again for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in buffer A supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and no EDTA ([Mg2+]free = 1 mm). The Rac-loaded liposomes were then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min to promote GTP hydrolysis on Rac and stored on ice before use. Aliquots (20 μl) from the initial lipid/protein suspension, the supernatants, and the final liposome suspension were withdrawn and analyzed by fluorometry and SDS-PAGE to determine liposome and protein recovery. Rac Glucosylation—Glucosylation reactions were performed at 30 °C. [14C]UDP-glucose (10 μm) was used as a glucose donor. Liposome-bound Rac-GDP, which was obtained by the GDI removal protocol, was diluted 2-fold in buffer A supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm MnCl2 to give a final lipid concentration of 3 mm and a final protein concentration of ∼0.25 μm (as estimated by SDS-PAGE). Glucosylation was initiated by the addition of LT. At the indicated times, 20-μl aliquots were withdrawn, diluted in 2 ml of ice-cold buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2), and filtered on 25-mm BA85 nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schüll). After two additional washes with 2 ml of ice-cold buffer, the filters were dried and counted. Limited Proteolysis—An LT cytosolic fragment (200 μg/ml) was incubated at 30 °C with trypsin (0.5 μg/ml) in buffer A supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm MnCl2. At the indicated times, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Sypro Orange staining. Cell Microinjection—NIH-3T3 cells were plated at low confluency on 13-mm glass coverslips for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). Cytosolic microinjection (Eppendorf 5171 microinjector) was performed with the indicated toxin (50 μg/ml) and with dextran-TRITC (1 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C the cells were fixed with a solution of 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and the polymerized actin was stained with phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). The glass coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem and VWR International) and observed by fluorescence microscopy using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica). In pilot experiments we tested the susceptibility of liposome-bound geranyl-geranylated Rac-GDP to glucosylation by full-length LT using liposomes made of a crude mixture of soybean lipids (azolectin). We observed that the rate of glucosylation largely exceeded the rate observed in solution using E. coli-expressed, non geranyl-geranylated Rac-GDP, the substrate that is classically used in in vitro experiments. This finding suggested that the lipid bilayer provided a favorable environment for the glucosylation reaction. This hypothesis was also supported by experiments using membranes from cells overexpressing Ras, which showed that detergents such as Triton X-100, at a concentration that did not modify the glucosylation of soluble substrates, strongly inhibited the glucosylation of Ras by LT (data not shown). These preliminary observations prompted us to examine the lipid binding properties of LT and notably that of the N-terminal domain, because this domain is released into the cytosol by proteolysis and glucosylates cellular substrates such as Rac or Ras. Lipid Binding Properties of the Various Domains of LT—To assess the lipid binding properties of LT, we performed sedimentation experiments using sucrose-loaded liposomes of defined composition. Liposome-bound and unbound proteins were separated by centrifugation and quantified by fluorometry after SDS-PAGE using Sypro Orange staining. The liposome composition was based on a background of neutral lipids consisting of PC (30–60%), PE (20%), and cholesterol (20%). When indicated, anionic lipids such as PS, PG, PA, or PI were included at the expense of PC. Fig. 1 compares the lipid binding properties of full-length LT with that of its N-terminal cytosolic domain (amino acids 1–546) or its C-terminal “receptor binding” domain (amino acids 1852–2366). These two latter forms were expressed in E. coli with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Full-length LT bound completely to all liposomes tested, including neutral PC/PE/cholesterol liposomes (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the C-terminal domain showed no binding to liposomes, either neutral or anionic (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the N-terminal cytosolic domain (hereafter abbreviated as LTcyt) bound weakly (15%) to neutral PC/PE/cholesterol liposomes but showed better binding to liposomes containing anionic lipids (Fig. 1D). Of all the anionic lipids tested, PS, the major anionic lipid of eukaryotic cell membranes, was the most potent. At 30 mol % PS, ∼80% of LTcyt was recovered in the liposome pellet (Fig. 1D). PG, which is abundant in bacterial membranes, and PIP2, which is present at low amount in cell membranes, induced a moderate binding of LTcyt. Other anionic lipids, including PA and PI, were less potent (Fig. 1D). Similar lipid binding properties were observed after removal of the N-terminal hexahistidine tag (data not shown). Taken together, these experiments show that LT displays complex lipid binding properties that are related to its composite domain organization. The central hydrophobic “translocation” domain probably accounts for the strong avidity of full-length LT for all liposomes (Fig. 1B). More intriguing was the binding of the cytosolic domain to PS-containing liposomes (Fig. 1D) insofar as PS is abundant in the cytosolic leaflet of cell membranes and notably the plasma membrane, where small G proteins such as Ras or Rac are found. Phosphatidylserine Facilitates Glucosylation of Liposome-bound Rac by LT—Next, we wished to test the effect of PS on the glucosylation of liposome-bound Rac-GDP by LT. For this task, it was first necessary to assess the minimal lipid composition required to prepare liposome-bound Rac. Geranyl-geranylated Rac-GDP was purified as a 1:1 soluble complex with GDI. To prepare liposome-bound Rac-GDP, we used a GDI removal protocol that takes advantage of the transient displacement of Rac from GDI and its binding to liposome during a single round of GTP binding and hydrolysis (19Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The rationale of this protocol is that the replacement of GDP by GTP weakens the interaction of Rac with GDI and thus facilitates the association of Rac with liposomes. Liposome-bound Rac-GTP can then be separated from soluble GDI by centrifugation and subsequently incubated with a millimolar concentration of magnesium to promote the conversion to the GDP-bound form because of the GTPase activity of Rac (19Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that under conditions favoring GDP to GTP exchange (low Mg2+ concentration), Rac accumulates strongly and with similar efficiency to all liposomes containing 30 mol % anionic lipids but not to neutral PC/PE/cholesterol liposomes. This finding suggested that nonspecific electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids contribute to the translocation of geranylgeranylated Rac from GDI to lipid membranes during GDP to GTP exchange. It is likely that these interactions involve a cluster of six basic residues adjacent to the C-terminal geranylgeranylated cysteine of Rac. The juxtaposition of basic residues with a lipid modification helps to anchor many proteins to lipid membranes, including prenylated small G proteins (20Bhatnagar R.S. Gordon J.I. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 14-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Murray D. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S.

Having established that liposome-bound Rac-GDP could be prepared on any anionic liposome, we conducted glucosylation reactions. We observed that the nature of the anionic lipid present in the liposomes had a dramatic effect on the rate of Rac-GDP glucosylation by full-length LT (Fig. 2B) as well as by LTcyt (Fig. 2C). In both cases, glucosylation proceeded slowly with PA as the sole source of anionic lipid, five times faster with PG, and 60 times faster with PS. Thus, the activity of LTcyt toward liposome-bound Rac-GDP correlated with its lipid binding properties (compare Figs. 2C and 1D). Moreover, despite the fact that full-length LT bound avidly to all liposomes tested (Fig. 1B), its activity also depended on the presence of PS (Fig. 2B), suggesting that PS favors the correct positioning of the cytosolic and glucosyltransferase N-terminal domain toward membrane-bound Rac-GDP. To further assess the specificity of LTcyt for PS, we conducted glucosylation reactions using liposomes containing increasing amounts of synthetic PS. Because the yield of liposome-bound Rac-GDP obtained by the GDI removal protocol depended on the presence of anionic lipids, PS was added at the expense of another anionic lipid (e.g. PI or PG) to keep constant the total amount of all anionic lipids at 30 mol %. Fig. 3A shows that the rate of Rac glucosylation increased 10-fold when PI was gradually replaced by dioleoyl-(C18:1-C18:1)-PS, with the half-maximal effect observed at 5 mol %. Interestingly, dipalmitoyl-(C16:0-C16:0)-PS was much less potent than dioleoyl-PS (Fig. 3B). A similar effect of acyl chain unsaturation was observed for the less activating lipid species PG (Fig. 3B). Therefore we suggest that lipid packing influences the accessibility of polar head groups to LTcyt. A Specific Binding Site for Phosphatidylserine in the N Terminus of Lethal Toxin—To search for the presence of subdomains in LTcyt, which are potentially involved in PS binding, we conducted limited proteolysis experiments. LTcyt was relatively resistant to digestion by trypsin, chymotrypsin, and subtilisin (Fig. 4 and data not shown). In all cases, the N-terminal hexahistidine tag used for purification was immediately cleaved (as revealed by Western blot). After 30 min, fragments that displayed an apparent molecular mass of at least 90% of the initial construct were observed. This suggests that LTcyt folds as a single domain probably flanked by somehow flexible short ends. Interestingly, centrifugation experiments revealed that the fragment generated by trypsin treatment that had the lowest molecular mass (apparent molecular mass = 54 kDa) bound less avidly to PS-containing liposomes as compared with the other fragments (Fig. 4). N-terminal sequencing revealed that this fragment starts from the 19th amino acid of LT. Therefore, we constructed an N-terminal truncated version of LTcyt lacking the first 18 amino acids ([Δ18]LTcyt) and compared its lipid binding properties with that of LTcyt. Fig. 5A shows that, in contrast to LTcyt, [Δ18]LTcyt showed no PS-dependent binding to liposomes. Importantly, LTcyt and [Δ18]LTcyt showed the same glucosyltransferase activity on non geranyl-geranylated Rac-GDP in solution, suggesting that residues 1–18 in LT play no role in the glucosyltransferase mechanism per se (Fig. 5B). It should be noted that these experiments were performed with an ∼100-fold higher concentration of LTcyt and [Δ18]LTcyt as compared with experiments on liposome-bound Rac (see Figs. 2C and 5C), thus illustrating the catalytic advantage provided by the lipid membrane environment. Next, we assessed the activity of [Δ18]LTcyt on liposome-bound Rac-GDP (Fig. 5C). In marked contrast with what was observed for LTcyt, the rate of glucosylation was slow and was not influenced by the nature of the anionic lipid present in the liposomes (compare Figs. 2C and 5C). We concluded from these experiments that the first 18 residues of LTcyt participate in the formation of a PS-specific binding site that helps to anchor the cytosolic domain of LT to lipid membranes, thereby facilitating the glucosylation of membrane-bound Rac. Amino Acids 1–18 Are Required for the Cytotoxicity of LTcyt— To determine the importance of the N terminus of LT for its cytotoxic effect in vivo, we microinjected LTcyt or [Δ18]LTcyt into various cell types (NIH-3T3, baby hamster kidney, and HeLa). After 3 h the cells were fixed, and the actin cytoskeleton was visualized by phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate. The data for NIH-3T3 cells are shown in Fig. 6, and similar results were observed for the other cell lines. In agreement with previous findings (2Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. de Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we observed that LTcyt triggered the disassembly of actin stress fibers and the formation of a thick cortical actin cytoskeleton. The cells lost their typical flat morphology and became round and smaller (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the cells microinjected with [Δ18]LTcyt were intact and indistinguishable from non-injected cells (Fig. 6B). Thus, although not involved in the glucosyl-transferase activity per se, the N terminus is essential for the cytotoxic activity of LTcyt. Toxin B from C. difficile Is Not Specific for PS—Among the four large Clostridial toxins, toxin B from C. difficile is the closest homolog to LT (3Busch C. Aktories K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Yet, as illustrated in Fig. 7A, the two toxins show substantial differences in their first 18 residues. Both toxins are rich in hydrophobic and basic residues, but toxin B contains a glutamic acid residue (Glu-10), whereas LT contains no acidic residue. In addition, there are some nonconservative substitutions between polar, charged, and hydrophobic residues (Ala → Lys, Val → Ala, and Tyr → Asn; see Fig. 7A). Fig. 7B shows that the cytosolic domain of toxin B was less sensitive to the anionic composition of liposomes than LT. The time course of Rac glucosylation by the cytosolic domain of toxin B was the same whether PS or PG was included in the liposomes, suggesting that some amino acid differences in the N terminus of LT and toxin B contribute to the striking PS-dependence of LT. In addition, the cytosolic domain of toxin B showed only modest levels of binding to PS-containing liposomes (<30%; data not shown). Membrane association facilitates protein-protein interactions by increasing local concentrations and directing protein orientation. In the case of Rac, membrane association has been shown to favor the catalysis of GDP/GTP exchange by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTP hydrolysis by GTPase-activating proteins (19Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Rossman K.L. Cheng L. Mahon G.M. Rojas R.J. Snyder J.T.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10542-10549Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here we show that the cytosolic domain of a bacterial toxin also takes advantage of the lipid environment to inactivate Rac. The catalytic domain of LT, which is released into the cytosol after cell infection, glucosylates the small G protein Rac-GDP much more efficiently in a minimal lipid environment than in solution. With an optimal lipid composition, the “kinetics gain” provided by the membrane environment results in at least a 100-fold increase in the rate of Rac glucosylation by LTcyt. Indeed, whereas non-prenylated Rac-GDP was glucosylated by 50 nm LTcyt with a half-time of 5 min in solution (Fig. 5B), only 0.25–0.5 nm LTcyt was needed to achieve a similar time course on geranyl-geranylated Rac-GDP bound to PC/PE/cholesterol/PS liposomes (Figs. 2C and 5C). Because the lipid binding properties of LTcyt correlate with its glucosyltransferase activity on liposome-bound Rac (Figs. 1D and 2C), we suggest that the modulation of LTcyt activity by membrane lipids results from an increase in the local concentration of LTcyt. Recent studies suggest that other protein toxins use membrane-partitioning mechanisms to act efficiently on membrane-associated proteins (28Caccin P. Rossetto O. Rigoni M. Johnson E. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Fernandez-Salas E. Steward L.E. Ho H. Garay P.E. Sun S.W. Gilmore M.A. Ordas J.V. Wang J. Francis J. Aoki K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3208-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Lee S.Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Clostridial neurotoxins, which cleave the cytosolic domain of the transmembrane SNARE proteins, act more efficiently in the presence of negatively charged lipids (28Caccin P. Rossetto O. Rigoni M. Johnson E. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The tarantula venom toxin VTX1 partitions into the membrane through a hydrophobic surface and thereby inhibits efficiently voltage-dependent ion channels despite a weak protein-protein interaction (30Lee S.Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). LTcyt shows a marked preference for PS as compared with other anionic lipids, including PG, PA, and phosphoinositides (Figs. 1D, 2C, and 3). PS is the most abundant anionic lipid in eukaryotic cells and is enriched in the cytosolic leaflet of cellular membranes, notably at the plasma membrane (31Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The specificity of LTcyt for PS thus provides a straightforward mechanism for targeting the glucosyltransferase domain to prenylated and membrane-associated small G proteins. In addition, the low abundance of PS in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane should prevent the glucosyltransferase domain from interfering with key membrane binding events that occur early during LT infection, including the recognition of cell surface receptors by the C-terminal domain and the translocation of the central hydrophobic domain through the endosomal membrane. Removal of the first 18 N-terminal residues of LTcyt was sufficient to abolish the effect of PS on LTcyt binding to liposomes (Fig. 5A) and on the LT-catalyzed glucosylation of liposome-bound Rac (Fig. 5C). However the N-terminal truncation had no effect on LTcyt activity on soluble recombinant Rac (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the lipid binding motif of LTcyt is not structurally coupled to the catalytic and Rac-binding domains, which have been localized, respectively, in the central and the C-terminal region of LTcyt (3Busch C. Aktories K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro S. Jeckel D. Aktories K. J. Biol.

The N terminus of LTcyt contains four basic residues, eight hydrophobic residues, and no acidic residues (Fig. 7A) and is therefore adapted to interact with negatively charged lipid membranes. Because this region is highly sensitive to proteolysis (Fig. 4A), we suggest that it forms a flexible chain that adsorbs at the surface of negatively charged membranes. Experimental and theoretical studies on proteins and model peptides have detailed the various combinations of electrostatic and hydrophobic forces that allow membrane adsorption of basic/hydrophobic clusters (21Murray D. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Structure. 1997; 5: 985-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 22Murray D. Arbuzova A. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Simon S.A. McIntosh T.J. Current Topics in Membranes. 52. Academic Press, New York2002: 277-307Google Scholar). When electrostatic interactions prevail, the basic cluster remains at some distance from the lipid polar heads because of the energy cost of desolvating charged groups. The interaction is thus nonspecific, and anionic lipids with the same net charge such as PS and PG are interchangeable in promoting membrane adsorption. However, when hydrophobic residues act in concert with basic residues, they lead to a deeper penetration of the protein region within the lipid polar head region and thus may impose some specificity toward given lipid head groups. The fact that LTcyt interacts preferentially with liposomes having anionic lipids with unsaturated acyl chains also argues for a deep membrane adsorption (Fig. 3B). Interestingly the cytosolic domain of C. difficile toxin B did not show a marked preference for PS (Fig. 7). Although highly homologous, lethal toxin and toxin B show a few substitutions in their N-terminal sequence between charged, polar, and hydrophobic residues (Fig. 7A). Mutagenesis and structural studies should help to further characterize the PS-binding site of LT.

https://openalex.org/W2054511824,"Intermediate filament (IF) keratins and keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) are principal structural components of hair and encoded by members of multiple gene families. The severe hair growth defects observed upon aberrant expression of certain keratin and KAP genes in both mouse and man suggest that proper hair growth requires their spatio-temporally coordinated activation. An essential prerequisite for studying these cis-regulatory mechanisms is to define corresponding gene families, their genomic organization, and expression patterns. This work characterizes eight recently identified high glycine/tyrosine (HGT)-type KAP genes collectively designated Krtap16-n. These genes are shown to be integrated into a larger KAP gene domain on mouse chromosome 16 (MMU16) that is orthologous to a recently described HGT- and high sulfur (HS)-type KAP gene complex on human chromosome 21q22.11. All Krtap16 genes exhibit strong expression in a narrowly defined pattern restricted to the lower and middle cortical region of the hair shaft in both developing and cycling hair. During hair follicle regression (catagen), expression levels decrease until expression is no longer detectable in follicles at resting stage (telogen). Since isolation of the Krtap16 genes was based on their differential expression in transgenic mice overexpressing the Hoxc13 transcriptional regulator in hair, we examined whether bona fide Hoxc13 binding sites associated with these genes might be functionally relevant by performing electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The data provide evidence for sequence-specific interaction between Hoxc13 and Krtap16 genes, thus supporting the concept of a regulatory relationship between Hoxc13 and these KAP genes."
https://openalex.org/W1967427779,"Argonaute proteins are central components of RNA interference (RNAi) and related phenomena in a wide variety of eukaryotes, including the early diverging protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. The single T. brucei Argonaute protein (TbAGO1) is in a complex with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and a fraction of this ribonucleoprotein particle is associated with polyribosomes. In this study, we generated a panel of insertion, deletion, and single point mutants of TbAGO1 and assayed them in vivo for their function in RNAi. In addition to the signature domains of Argonaute proteins, PAZ and Piwi, TbAGO1 has an N-terminal domain with a high abundance of RGG repeats. Deletion of the N-terminal domain blocked association of AGO1 with polyribosomes and severely affected mRNA cleavage. Nevertheless, the mutant protein was in a complex with siRNAs. In contrast, deletion of the Piwi domain led to a loss of siRNAs but did not abolish polyribosome association. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acids in the Piwi domain identified arginine 735 as essential for RNAi. Although the R735A mutant bound siRNAs and associated with polyribosomes, it displayed a severe defect in the cleavage of target mRNA. Argonaute proteins are central components of RNA interference (RNAi) and related phenomena in a wide variety of eukaryotes, including the early diverging protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. The single T. brucei Argonaute protein (TbAGO1) is in a complex with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and a fraction of this ribonucleoprotein particle is associated with polyribosomes. In this study, we generated a panel of insertion, deletion, and single point mutants of TbAGO1 and assayed them in vivo for their function in RNAi. In addition to the signature domains of Argonaute proteins, PAZ and Piwi, TbAGO1 has an N-terminal domain with a high abundance of RGG repeats. Deletion of the N-terminal domain blocked association of AGO1 with polyribosomes and severely affected mRNA cleavage. Nevertheless, the mutant protein was in a complex with siRNAs. In contrast, deletion of the Piwi domain led to a loss of siRNAs but did not abolish polyribosome association. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acids in the Piwi domain identified arginine 735 as essential for RNAi. Although the R735A mutant bound siRNAs and associated with polyribosomes, it displayed a severe defect in the cleavage of target mRNA. RNA interference (RNAi) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; siRNAs, small interfering RNAs; AGO, Argonaute protein; TbAGO, T. brucei AGO; siRNP, small interfering ribonucleoprotein; Tn, transposon. is a gene-silencing mechanism that is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). RNAi is operational in a large number of eukaryotic organisms, including the early diverging protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, suggesting an ancient evolutionary origin. In recent years, RNAi involvement has been discovered in a variety of phenomena that effect gene silencing at the RNA or DNA level. These include mRNA degradation, translational or transcriptional repression, histone and DNA methylation, and programmed DNA elimination (reviewed in Ref. 1Murchison E.P. Hannon G.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although on the surface these gene-silencing phenomena might appear quite different, they so far share two characteristics. First, they share the presence of ∼20–26-nucleotide-long small RNAs, referred to as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs, which are produced as a result of cleaving dsRNA by an endonuclease termed Dicer. Second, they share the incorporation of these small RNAs into a multimeric ribonucleoprotein complex, known as RNA-induced silencing complex, containing at least one member of the Argonaute (AGO) protein family. The Argonaute family of proteins was first defined in Arabidopsis thaliana by way of a genetic screen (2Bohmert K. Camus I. Bellini C. Bouchez D. Caboche M. Benning C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and was subsequently linked to RNAi through biochemical studies in Drosophila (3Hammond S.M. Boettcher S. Caudy A.A. Kobayashi R. Hannon G.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). In single cell eukaryotes there appear to be one or two AGO family genes, whereas in multicellular organisms this gene family has expanded to include up to 24 family members as in the case of Caenorhabditis elegans (4Carmell M.A. Xuan Z. Zhang M.Q. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2733-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Argonaute proteins are characterized by two domains: a PAZ domain of ∼110 residues found near the middle of the protein and a C-terminal Piwi domain (4Carmell M.A. Xuan Z. Zhang M.Q. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2733-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Structural studies have defined the PAZ domain as an RNA-binding module (5Yan K.S. Yan S. Farooq A. Han A. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6Lingel A. Simon B. Izaurralde E. Sattler M. Nature. 2003; 426: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Song J.J. Liu J. Tolia N.H. Schneiderman J. Smith S.K. Martienssen R.A. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 1026-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and this domain might function as an anchoring site for the two-nucleotide 3′-overhang of siRNAs (8Ma J.B. Ye K. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 429: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The 300-amino acid Piwi domain displays a high degree of similarity among Argonaute family members and is present in prokaryotes (9Cerutti L. Mian N. Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 481-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Very recent structural studies (10Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M. Joshua-Tor L. Hannon G.J. Science. 2004; 305: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 11Song J.J. Smith S.K. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Science. 2004; 305: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) have revealed that Piwi is similar to an RNase H domain, thus supporting a model for Argonaute as the nuclease responsible for targeted mRNA cleavage. Here we have undertaken a functional analysis of the T. brucei Argonaute 1 (TbAGO1) protein, the only member of the Argonaute family identified in this organism. Previous studies (12Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that TbAGO1 is essential for RNAi and is required for accumulation of siRNAs and for down-regulation of endogenous retroposon transcript levels. Furthermore, a proportion of a ribonucleoprotein complex containing TbAGO1 and siRNAs is found associated with polyribosomes, suggesting a connection between the RNAi and translation machinery in trypanosomes (12Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Djikeng A. Shi H. Tschudi C. Shen S. Ullu E. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present study, we built on the observation that AGO1 knock-out cells in T. brucei are viable and have tested mutations in AGO1 for their ability to restore RNAi in this genetic background. Construction of AGO1 Mutants—To generate random insertions in TbAGO1, we used the EZ::TN in-frame linker insertion kit (EPICENTRE). To favor insertions in the TbAgo1 gene, we subcloned the XhoI-EcoRI fragment containing the open reading frame and the 5′-untranslated region into the pSP72 vector. The transposition reaction was carried out in vitro according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli cells, and PCR screening of bacterial colonies with transposon- and Ago1-specific primers was used to identify insertions in the Ago1 gene. The kanamycin resistance gene was removed by NotI digestion, leaving a 57-bp (19 amino acids) in-frame insertion. 10 insertions scattered randomly throughout the Ago1 gene were transferred into the complementation vector and transformed into ago1–/– cells as described previously (12Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Deletion constructs were generated by PCR and cloned into the complementation vector. Deletion of the RGG domain (ΔRGG) removed amino acids 2–68. In Δ2–267, amino acids 2–267 of AGO1 were removed. Δ2–418 did not contain amino acids 2–418, and ΔPiwi was missing amino acids 550–903. Epitope tags in TbAGO1 and single amino acid substitutions in the AGO1 protein were introduced by a two-step PCR procedure, and all mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Other Procedures—RNA extraction, dsRNA transfection, and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (14Djikeng A. Shi H. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1522-1530PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (see Ref. 12Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation and sucrose density gradient analysis of cytoplasmic extracts were carried out as described previously (13Djikeng A. Shi H. Tschudi C. Shen S. Ullu E. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Random In-frame Linker Insertions in AGO1—In a first approach to localizing functional domains in the T. brucei AGO1 protein, we generated several hundred random 57-bp (19 amino acids) in-frame insertions using a transposon-based strategy. To assess the validity of this strategy, we arbitrarily selected 10 insertions scattered across the target gene (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1) and tested them in vivo by complementation of ago1–/– cells as described previously (12Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Next, cells expressing the various AGO1 insertion mutants were examined for RNAi competency by assaying the ability of dsRNA corresponding to the α-tubulin mRNA to produce the FAT phenotype (cells with multiple nuclei, flagella, and mitochondrial genomes). As reported previously (12Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), ago1–/– cells are deficient in RNAi (i.e. no FAT cells), and complementation with the wild-type AGO1 gene restored RNAi. In 6 of the 10 insertions tested, the FAT phenotype was apparent following electroporation with α-tubulin dsRNA (Fig. 1), revealing that these particular alterations in the RGG, PAZ, and Piwi domains did not affect AGO1 function. On the other hand, four insertional mutations failed to re-establish RNAi; one was in the PAZ domain, and the other three were in the Piwi domain. The lack of complementation by four constructs might reflect a loss of function and/or instability of the mutant protein. Thus, we determined the steady-state levels of the mutant proteins by Western blot analysis with anti-AGO1 antibodies (Fig. 2A). There was no significant difference in the level of wild-type protein and mutant AGO1 proteins capable of restoring RNAi. However, the four non-functional AGO1 proteins either were not detected or were present at greatly reduced levels, suggesting that the proteins were unstable. This was supported by Northern blot analysis, which showed equal accumulation of mRNA in all cell lines (data not shown). Thus, the phenotypes of the mutants accumulating low amounts of the AGO protein are difficult to interpret in terms of their activity in RNAi. Deletion Constructs and Targeted Point Mutations of Highly Conserved Residues in AGO1—To further map the functional domains in TbAGO1, we generated four deletion constructs, namely, ΔRGG (deletion of residues 2–61), Δ2–267 (deletion of the N terminus up to the PAZ domain), Δ2–418 (deletion of the N terminus including the PAZ domain), and ΔPiwi (deletion of the Piwi domain at the C terminus). Furthermore, by means of the multiple sequence alignment programs ClustalW and T-Coffee, we constructed 14 single amino acid substitutions throughout the protein, using as guidance the results of the alignment of the TbAGO1 sequence with other members of the Argonaute family. Originally, 22 Argonaute proteins were included in the analysis, but only a representative subset is shown in supplemental Fig. 1. As noted previously, the highest conservation among the different proteins was observed in the Piwi domain (9Cerutti L. Mian N. Bateman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 481-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), which in TbAGO1 covers amino acids 553–873. In this region, six residues are highlighted that are 100% conserved among the different members of the Argonaute family. In contrast, in the second signature motif, the PAZ domain (amino acids 279–405 in TbAGO1), there are no residues that are strictly conserved. Other than these two domains, the sequence conservation among all the Argonaute proteins is rather limited. Nevertheless, one noteworthy result of these alignments was the identification of a conserved short sequence motif in the last four amino acids at the C terminus, (M/L)X(F/Y)X. Interestingly, one of the RNAi-deficient mutant alleles of C. elegans RDE-1, ne297, maps to a glycine residue immediately upstream from the conserved motif (supplemental Fig. 1 and Ref. 15Tabara H. Sarkissian M. Kelly W.G. Fleenor J. Grishok A. Timmons L. Fire A. Mello C.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Based on the above alignments, the six residues strictly conserved in the Piwi domain were selected for site-directed mutagenesis studies and individually substituted by alanine (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, we mutated four residues in the PAZ domain and two residues in the region between the PAZ and Piwi domains that are conserved among a subset of Argonaute proteins. Finally, we targeted the methionine and tyrosine residues at the very C terminus. Summary of Phenotypic Analysis of AGO1 Mutations—Following the establishment of stable cell lines in the ago1–/– background, the 14 single amino acid changes in the AGO1 protein and the deletion mutants were scored for the restoration of the RNAi phenotype by assaying the ability of dsRNA corresponding to the α-tubulin gene to produce the FAT phenotype and for the level of protein expression. Based on these results, the mutants were placed into three categories (Fig. 1). The first group of mutants (T346A, Y350A, F351A, Y355A, L450A, P453A, G818A, and M889A) had no effect on RNAi, i.e. complementation of the ago1–/– cells restored the RNAi phenotype to wild-type levels (data not shown). In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that these mutant proteins had expression levels comparable with that of wild-type AGO1 (Fig. 2B) (data not shown). In contrast, the second set of mutants, including the single amino acid changes K600A, G793A, F808A, Y825A, and Y891A and the deletion constructs Δ2–267 and Δ2–418, displayed extremely poor expression levels of the AGO1 protein and were therefore not included in further experiments (Fig. 2B) (data not shown). It was somewhat unexpected to find that five of the eight mutants made in the Piwi domain and in the conserved C-terminal motif accumulated very little protein. Because the mRNA levels of these five mutants were comparable with wild-type levels (data not shown), this might suggest that the Piwi domain structure is very sensitive to perturbations and easily misfolds. Alternatively, it might suggest that the Piwi domain might be required for interaction with another component of the RNAi pathway and that the mutations prevent this functional interaction from occurring and as a consequence the AGO1 protein is degraded. Finally, the ΔRGG and ΔPiwi mutants as well as one single point mutation in the Piwi domain (R735A) did not restore RNAi but had protein expression levels comparable with that of wild-type AGO1 (Fig. 2D) and thus were subjected to a more detailed analysis. R735A and the ΔRGG Affect the Effector Step of RNAi—To examine what step of the RNAi pathway was affected by the R735A and the two deletion mutants (ΔRGG and ΔPiwi), we first monitored the accumulation of endogenous siRNAs derived from Ingi retroposon transcripts. Whereas ago1–/– cells are deficient in the accumulation of siRNAs derived from Ingi transcripts (Fig. 2C, lane 2) (12Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the abundance of Ingi siRNAs was not noticeably affected by either the R735A or ΔRGG mutation (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, deletion of the Piwi domain manifested a phenotype similar to ago1–/– cells, with no apparent accumulation of Ingi siRNAs (Fig. 2C, lane 5). Next, we analyzed the distribution of the R735A, ΔPiwi, and ΔRGG mutant proteins in cell extracts by differential centrifugation (Fig. 2D). As we have shown previously (12Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), wild-type AGO1 is mostly found in the postnuclear supernatant (Fig. 2D, lane 2) and in the S100 fraction (Fig. 2D, lane 4). In addition, a proportion of AGO1 is present in the 100,000 × g pellet together with large complexes, including ribosomes (Fig. 2D, lane 5). A similar analysis of the R735A and ΔPiwi mutants revealed fractionation properties comparable with those of wild-type AGO1 (Fig. 2D). In contrast, centrifugation of a cell extract from the ΔRGG mutant at 100,000 × g revealed that the protein was exclusively recovered in the supernatant, with no detectable levels in the pellet (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 4 and 5). To further evaluate the sedimentation characteristics of the mutant AGO1 proteins, cytoplasmic extracts were centrifuged through a 15–50% sucrose gradient, and individual fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-AGO1 antibodies (Fig. 3). By this analysis, R735A and ΔPiwi partially co-sedimented with polyribosomes, similar to wild-type AGO1 protein. However, it is worth noting that the deletion of the Piwi domain changed the sedimentation behavior of the Argonaute protein in that the majority of the protein fractionated with an apparent sedimentation value of 40–60 S. At present, we have no explanation for this observation, but experiments are in progress to address this issue. In contrast, the majority of the ΔRGG mutant protein was found near the top of the gradient, and there was very little of the protein in the gradient fractions where polyribosomes sediment (Fig. 3). One possible explanation for this result is that although siRNAs were present in the ΔRGG background, they did not form a ribonucleoprotein complex with the mutated AGO1 protein. To address this issue, an epitope-tagged version of the ΔRGG protein was immunoprecipitated from a cytoplasmic extract, and the immunoprecipitate was assayed by Northern blotting for the presence of Ingi siRNAs (Fig. 4). This assay revealed that the deletion of the RGG domain does not impair the formation of AGO1·siRNA complexes. Thus, it appeared that the N-terminal RGG domain contains a determinant for the association of AGO1 with polyribosomes.Fig. 4Association of wild-type (wt) and ΔRGG AGO1 with Ingi siRNAs. A cytoplasmic extract from cells expressing N-terminal BB2-tagged AGO1 or N-terminal BB2-tagged ΔRGG was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-BB2 antibodies, and supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were processed for Western blot analysis for AGO1 (A) and Northern blot analysis for Ingi siRNAs (B) as well as for 5 S RNA to control for immunoprecipitation specificity (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because cells expressing the ΔRGG or R735A mutant proteins accumulated wild-type levels of siRNAs, we next tested whether they are competent to cleave target mRNA on exposure to trigger dsRNA. For this test, cells expressing wild-type, ΔRGG, and R735A AGO1 were electroporated with different amounts of α-tubulin dsRNA, and the fate of the targeted mRNA was monitored by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5A). As expected, wild-type cells were very sensitive to dsRNA, with 1 μg resulting in the degradation of more than 80% of α-tubulin mRNA (Fig. 5A, lane 2). With higher doses of dsRNA, the extent of degradation of α-tubulin mRNA reached a plateau, indicating that the reaction was saturated. In contrast, at all dsRNA doses tested, cells expressing ΔRGG or R735A AGO1 demonstrated a severe reduction in their ability to target α-tubulin mRNA for degradation (Fig. 5B). In particular, using 1 μg of dsRNA/transfection, the efficiency of the last step of RNAi was reduced by approximately 4-fold in both mutant backgrounds. In both cases, at doses of dsRNA that are saturating for wild-type cells, there was only a slight increase in the degradation of α-tubulin mRNA. Thus, ΔRGG and R735A proteins are severely defective in the efficiency of cleavage of target mRNA, namely, in the effector step of RNAi. Our goal in this study was to provide a better understanding of the molecular function of Argonaute 1 in the RNAi pathway in T. brucei. To do this, we used in vivo complementation of an ago1–/– strain as a means to test the functional significance of predicted domains in AGO1. Like other members of the Argonaute family, the T. brucei protein contains a centrally located PAZ domain and a C-terminal Piwi domain. An additional noticeable feature of AGO1 is the presence at the N terminus of five direct repeats that are rich in arginine and glycine residues with a high abundance of RGG repeats. We have previously hypothesized that this RGG domain is subjected to post-translational modifications by an arginine methyltransferase (12Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In one series of mutant proteins, we randomly inserted 19 amino acids by a Tn5-based transposon strategy and tested 10 of them for their function in RNAi. Whereas four proteins were inactive and were detected at much reduced levels in cells, we were surprised to find six insertions that were tolerated at sites distributed throughout the protein, including the RGG, PAZ, and Piwi domains. Of particular interest are the three insertions in the PAZ domain, because its structure has recently been determined in the free state (5Yan K.S. Yan S. Farooq A. Han A. Zeng L. Zhou M.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6Lingel A. Simon B. Izaurralde E. Sattler M. Nature. 2003; 426: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Song J.J. Liu J. Tolia N.H. Schneiderman J. Smith S.K. Martienssen R.A. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 1026-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) as well as in a complex with a 9-mer siRNA-like duplex (8Ma J.B. Ye K. Patel D.J. Nature. 2004; 429: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The two permissive sites (Fig. 1, Tn387 and Tn399) can be reconciled with being near the C terminus of the PAZ fold, in a region that appears to be unstructured. On the other hand, insertion Tn348 was not tolerated and is located in an aromatic cluster forming helix α3, which lines the RNA-binding pocket of the PAZ domain. Thus, it is very likely that the insertion of 19 amino acids in this functionally important region of the PAZ domain resulted in a severe defect in protein folding and/or stability, which is manifested by very low levels of protein accumulation in cells. However, it is somewhat intriguing that when we probed individual conserved residues in this helix by site-directed mutagenesis, namely Thr-346, Tyr-350, Phe-351, and Tyr-355, we did not observe an effect on protein expression or RNAi function (Fig. 1). Because the primary sequence of the TbAGO1 PAZ domain is quite divergent from that of higher eukaryotes and cannot be convincingly modeled on the existing PAZ domain structure, structural studies will be required to interpret the effect of the above mentioned mutations. One intriguing aspect of RNAi, although not fully understood, is the potential interplay with translation. In particular, evidence is accumulating to support a functional link between RNA-induced silencing complexes or RNA-induced silencing complex components and ribosomes (3Hammond S.M. Boettcher S. Caudy A.A. Kobayashi R. Hannon G.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 12Shi H. Djikeng A. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that the N-terminal RGG domain of TbAGO1 is required for the stable association of the AGO1·siRNP with polyribosomes. At the same time, deletion of this domain severely impairs but does not completely abolish cleavage of target mRNA. It is tempting to speculate that the association of the AGO1·siRNP with polyribosomes increases the efficiency of target mRNA cleavage, at least in the case of those mRNAs that, like α-tubulin, are almost quantitatively associated with polyribosomes (20Ullu E. Djikeng A. Shi H. Tschudi C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The residual RNAi activity of the ΔRGG protein might be taken as an indication that mRNA cleavage can occur in the absence of an association of the AGO1·siRNP with polyribosomes. Alternatively, it is possible the ΔRGG·siRNP might still bind to translating ribosomes but with decreased affinity relative to the wild-type particle. The RGG domain of AGO1 might bind to ribosomes directly or indirectly via interaction with other components. Indeed, RGG motifs appear to be bifunctional modules for RNA binding and/or for protein-protein interactions, and they are known targets for methylation of arginine residues by type I or type II protein arginine methyltransferase (21McBride A.E. Silver P.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). It has been argued that the addition of methyl groups to arginine might serve as a means to modulate either intra- or intermolecular protein-protein interactions. At present we do not know whether RNA binding and/or arginine modifications of the AGO1 RGG domain are involved in the observed polyribosome association. However, the preliminary findings from mass spectrometry examination of TbAGO1 are consistent with the presence of dimethylated arginine residues in the RGG domain, 2N. Chamond, A. Djikeng, E. Ullu, and C. Tschudi, unpublished observation. and we are currently investigating the role of arginine methylation in the activity of TbAGO1 in RNAi. Finally, it is important to point out that the N-terminal RGG domain is not a unique feature of the trypanosome Argonaute protein. Similar repeats, although not as prevalent, are found at the N terminus of Arabidopsis AGO1. We hypothesized previously (13Djikeng A. Shi H. Tschudi C. Shen S. Ullu E. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that siRNPs interact directly with one or more components of the ribosome, similarly to what has been described in Drosophila (18Ishizuka A. Siomi M.C. Siomi H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2497-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we argued that this association is not mediated by the interaction of siRNAs with their specific target mRNA and is most likely independent of the identity of the mRNA that is being translated. One of our deletion mutants corroborates this hypothesis in that the removal of the Piwi domain generated a scenario in which siRNAs did not accumulate and hence did not form a complex with the mutated AGO1. Nevertheless, this protein associates with polyribosomes, underscoring that siRNAs do not play a role in this interaction. In a second approach to identifying essential residues for RNAi function, we produced a panel of 14 site-directed AGO1 mutants. Remarkably, we found that five of eight mutants introduced in the Piwi domain and at the very C terminus had phenotypes similar to the non-functional insertion mutants described above, consisting of very low intracellular accumulation of the Argonaute protein and an inability to complement the RNAi deficiency. Nevertheless, our screen generated one mutant protein (R735A) that was expressed at levels similar to wild-type AGO1 but failed to restore RNAi. Arg-735 in the Piwi domain is strictly conserved in all members of the Argonaute gene family in eukaryotes but is not present in the few available Piwi-containing proteins in prokaryotes. Our detailed phenotypic analysis revealed that cells expressing the R735A mutant were defective in RNAi at the step of target mRNA cleavage, suggesting that the Piwi domain was responsible for mRNA cleavage, either directly or indirectly. While this manuscript was in preparation, two reports (10Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M. Joshua-Tor L. Hannon G.J. Science. 2004; 305: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 11Song J.J. Smith S.K. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L.

In particular, structural studies of a Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute protein revealed the Piwi domain to be a member of the RNase H family, with an active site triad of acidic residues termed the DDE motif. Remarkably, a fourth residue in the center of the active site is an arginine and corresponds to arginine 735 in the T. brucei protein. Taken together, we can put forward the notion that mutating Arg-735 to alanine inactivated the catalytic activity of the Piwi domain, which by analogy to mammalian Argonaute 2 would be cleavage of the target mRNA. Thus, it appears very likely that the T. brucei Argonaute 1 protein functions as the nuclease in RNAi. We thank Shulamit Michaeli for helpful comments on the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2065956908,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) are DNA binding transcription factors with basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) domains. These two proteins form a heterodimer that mediates the toxic and biological effects of the environmental contaminant and AHR ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.

Endogenous CoCoA was recruited to a natural AHR target gene promoter in a 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin -dependent manner.

Polycyclic or halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and other related planar organochlorinated compounds elicit many adverse biological effects, including immunosuppression, teratogenesis, tumor promotion, hormonal disregulation, and cardiovascular disease. All of these biological effects are believed to be mediated by the sustained activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) 1The abbreviations used are: AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ARNT, AHR nuclear translocator; CoCoA, coiled-coil coactivator; NR, nuclear receptor; bHLH/PAS, basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim; TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; XRE, xenobiotic response element; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ER, estrogen receptor; DBD, DNA-binding domain.1The abbreviations used are: AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ARNT, AHR nuclear translocator; CoCoA, coiled-coil coactivator; NR, nuclear receptor; bHLH/PAS, basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim; TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; XRE, xenobiotic response element; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ER, estrogen receptor; DBD, DNA-binding domain.

Interact. 2002; 141: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). AHR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) gene family (3Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). bHLH-PAS proteins share a conserved N-terminal structural motif. The bHLH domain of most (but not all) bHLH-PAS proteins is used for specific DNA binding and/or heterodimerization with other bHLH-PAS proteins. The PAS domain located immediately after the bHLH domain harbors two conserved hydrophobic repeats termed A and B and functions as a sensor of specific environmental signals, a ligand binding surface, and a protein-protein interaction surface in various bHLH-PAS transcription factors, such as AHR and hypoxia-inducible factors. Another member of this family, AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) is an indispensable heterodimer partner for AHR and hypoxia-inducible factors. In addition to the heterodimerization with AHR or hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, ARNT homodimers are likely to play physiological roles by binding to the E-box core sequence found in some types of enhancer elements (4Huffman J.L. Mokashi A. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40537-40544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). AHR is found in the cytosol in a heterotetrameric complex with two Hsp90 molecules and one X-associated protein 2 (XAP2) molecule (5Meyer B.K. Pray-Grant M.G. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Perdew G.H. Mol.

Upon binding of xenobiotic compounds such as TCDD, the complexes translocate to the nucleus, where the AHR heterodimerizes with ARNT after Hsp90 dissociation (2Denison M.S. Pandini A. Nagy S.R. Baldwin E.P. Bonati L. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2002; 141: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 6Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2002; 141: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Heterodimeric AHR·ARNT complexes bind to specific enhancer elements called xenobiotic response elements (XREs) found in the regulatory domains of numerous genes (7Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 511-518PubMed Google Scholar). Genes transcriptionally activated by AHR·ARNT encode several enzymes that metabolize xenobiotic compounds (e.g. cytochrome P-450 enzymes such as CYP1A1) and proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos (8Hoffer A. Chang C.Y. Puga A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 238-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). AHR is also apparently involved in hepatic growth and development of the immune system, based on the phenotype of AHR knock-out mice, and may play a role in the cell cycle (10Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 1194-1198PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Despite the structural and functional differences between AHR·ARNT and nuclear receptors (NRs), both are ligand-regulated transcription factors and share common coregulators to mediate their transcription-enhancing activities. For example, the NR corepressor SMRT binds to AHR·ARNT and inhibits AHR·ARNT activity (12Nguyen T.A. Hoivik D. Lee J.E. Safe S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The AHR·ARNT heterodimer also interacts with NR coactivators such as the p160 coactivators SRC-1, GRIP-1, and p/CIP (13Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K.

Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 273-286PubMed Google Scholar), which enhance AHR/ARNT-mediated transcription in transient reporter gene assays. Although they have not been shown to bind DNA, the p160 coactivators also contain N-terminal bHLH-PAS domains (3Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 15Xu J. Li Q. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1681-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p160 coactivators are recruited to the CYP1A1 enhancer region in a TCDD-dependent fashion (13Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We previously isolated a novel NR coactivator, CoCoA, using the bHLH-PAS domain of GRIP1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen (16Stallcup M.R. Kim J.H. Teyssier C. Lee Y.H. Ma H. Chen D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CoCoA is a new type of NR coactivator with a potent C-terminal activation domain and a central coiled-coil domain that binds the bHLH-PAS motif of p160 coactivators. Thus, CoCoA acts as a secondary coactivator for NRs, interacting with them indirectly through the primary p160 coactivators. Given the shared bHLH-PAS domains among p160 coactivators and bHLH-PAS transcription factors, we tested whether CoCoA could physically and functionally interact with AHR and ARNT as a coactivator in TCDD-dependent gene activation. Construction of Plasmids—The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mouse AHR (pACTAG-2.mAHR) and ARNT (pACTAG-2.mARNT) expression plasmids, Gal4 DBD-fused ARNT expression plasmid, and a CYP1A1-luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL-CYP1A1-LUC) containing 2.6 kilo-bases of the regulatory sequence of rat CYP1A1 gene are the kind gifts of Oliver Hankinson and Timothy Beischlag (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). PCR amplification and subcloning into the indicated restriction sites were performed to create plasmids encoding the following AHR and ARNT fragments (amino acid numbers in parentheses): AHR N (1–374), AHR C (375–805), ARNT N (1–458), and ARNT C (459–791) fragments digested with EcoRI and XhoI were inserted into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pSG5.HA, and ARNT N was inserted into EcoRI and SalI sites of pM. pSG5.HA-CoCoA, pSG5.HA-CoCoA (1–500), pcDNA3.1-CoCoA/V5-His, pGEX-5x-1-Co-CoA, pSG5.HA-GRIP1, pSG5.HA-GRIP1 (563–1462), and GK1-LUC were described previously (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—COS-7 cell transfection, coimmunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation, cell lysate containing 1 mg of protein was incubated with 1 μg of the anti-V5 antibody R960–25 (Invitrogen), mouse normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 10 μl of an equal mixture of the two rabbit antisera against CoCoA (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or preimmune sera, and 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose suspension (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoblots were then performed on the precipitated proteins with anti-HA antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently, the membrane was stripped of bound antibody and re-probed with the anti-V5 antibody. GST Pull-down Assay—HA epitope-tagged AHR, ARNT, and their fragments were synthesized in vitro by using TNT-Quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-HA antibody. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Hepa1c1c7 cells, hereafter referred to as Hepa-1 cells, were maintained in α minimal essential medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK 293T cells and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For reporter gene assays, HEK 293T and Hepa-1 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hepa-1 cells were transiently transfected by Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total amount of plasmid DNA added to each well was adjusted to 1.0 μg by adding the necessary amount of pSG5.HA empty vector. Three hours after transfection cells were treated with either 10 nm TCDD or 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) vehicle and incubated for a further 18 h before luciferase assays. The results shown are the means and S.D. of triplicate points. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Hepa-1 cells were treated with 10 nm TCDD for 60 min. ChIP assays were performed largely as described previously (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The cross-linked, sheared chromatin solution was used for immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of anti-AHR antibody MA1–513 (Affinity BioReagents), 2 μg of anti-GRIP1 antibody A300–025A (Bethyl Laboratories), or 10 μl of an equal mixture of the two rabbit antisera against CoCoA (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated DNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, precipitated by ethanol, and amplified by PCR using primers flanking the murine CYP1A1 enhancer region (–1141 to –784 from the transcription initiation site) or β-actin promoter region (–527 to –205): CYP1A1 (–1141/–784), 5′-CTATCTCTTAAACCCCACCCCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAAGTATGGTGGAGGAAAGGGTG-3′ (reverse); β-actin (–527 to –205), 5′-ATTGCTAGCAATTGCTAGCAAGGGGGAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGAGAAAGCGAGATTGAGGAAGAGGATGA-3′ (reverse). RNA Interference and Reverse Transcription-PCR—COS-7 transfection with siRNAs, reverse transcription-PCR, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hepa-1 cells were plated into 12-well plates, grown until 70–80% confluence, and transfected with 40 or 80 pmol of scrambled sequence or CoCoA-specific siRNA duplex using Lipofectamine 2000 after the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was performed with 1–50 ng of total RNA using the Access reverse transcription-PCR system (Promega). The primers used in reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions were as follows: CoCoA, 5′-CACCTACATCCCCAACACCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTCATCAGCACTTTGTCACT-3′ (reverse); CYP1A1, 5′-CCAGACCTCTACAGCTTCACACTTATCACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGTCCTGACAATGCTCAATGAGGCTGTC-3′ (reverse); β-actin, 5′-TGTGATGGTGGGAATGGGTCAGAAGGACTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCATCGTACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATC-3′ (reverse). The relative quantity of the PCR products was determined by densitometric analysis using the UN-SC-AN-IT gel software (Silk Scientific, Inc.). CoCoA Interacts with AHR and ARNT—Because the bHLH-PAS domain of the p160 coactivators is also present in AHR, ARNT, and other bHLH-PAS transcription factors, we tested whether CoCoA has the ability to interact with AHR and ARNT. In an in vitro GST pull-down assay GST-CoCoA efficiently bound full-length AHR and ARNT synthesized in vitro (Fig. 1, A and B). The interaction with AHR was TCDD-independent. To study in vivo interactions by co-immunoprecipitation, COS-7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for V5-tagged CoCoA and HA-tagged AHR or ARNT. Anti-V5 antibodies efficiently and specifically precipitated AHR and ARNT (Fig. 1, C and D). Again, the interaction between CoCoA and AHR was TCDD-independent (data not shown). Other AHR coactivators can also bind efficiently to AHR without its ligand (13Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 18Ge N.L. Elferink C.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22515-22519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to the ligand-dependent interactions of NRs with many coactivators. To characterize the CoCoA interaction domains in AHR and ARNT, the N-terminal (AHR 1–374 and ARNT 1–458) and C-terminal (AHR 375–805 and ARNT 459–799) portions (Fig. 2A) were tested for binding to CoCoA. In GST pull-down assays full-length AHR and its N-terminal and C-terminal domains interacted with CoCoA (Fig. 2B). The N-terminal bHLH-PAS domain of AHR (which contains the ligand binding function) interacted with CoCoA in the absence and the presence of TCDD (data not shown). Because ARNT fragments were not generated efficiently by in vitro translation, ARNT deletion mutants were tested in co-immunoprecipitation assays. CoCoA interacted with the N-terminal bHLH-PAS region but not with the C-terminal activation domain of ARNT (Fig. 2C). CoCoA Potentiates Dioxin-dependent AHR/ARNT-mediated Transcription—CoCoA functions as a secondary coactivator to enhance transactivation by NRs; i.e. CoCoA binds to NRs indirectly through p160 coactivators, and the ability of CoCoA to enhance NR function depends on the presence of p160 coactivators (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast, CoCoA appears to interact directly with AHR and ARNT (Figs. 1 and 2). To investigate whether CoCoA can function as a primary coactivator for AHR·ARNT, we transfected AHR/ARNT-positive Hepa-1 cells with a luciferase reporter plasmid controlled by the XRE-containing CYP1A1 promoter together with expression vectors for GRIP1, CoCoA, or both. TCDD treatment alone enhanced CYP1A1 promoter-driven luciferase activity nearly 28-fold (Fig. 3A, assay 1). As expected (13Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), overexpression of GRIP1 enhanced AHR function in a dose-dependent and TCDD-dependent manner (assays 2–5). CoCoA expression increased TCDD-dependent reporter gene activity up to 5-fold (assays 6–9). This stimulation of AHR·ARNT activity was dependent on the amount of CoCoA, and the magnitude of stimulation was similar to that produced by GRIP1 under the same conditions. Despite the fact that CoCoA binds to AHR in a ligand-independent manner (Fig. 1A), the effect of CoCoA on AHR-mediated transcription was TCDD-dependent. When CoCoA was co-expressed with GRIP1, an additive induction of AHR/ARNT-mediated transactivation was observed (assays 10–11). These results suggest that GRIP1 and CoCoA both interact directly with AHR·ARNT, function as primary coactivators, and make distinct contributions to AHR/ARNT-mediated transcriptional activation. Although p160 coactivators contain an N-terminal bHLH-PAS domain, they do not utilize this domain to interact with AHR and ARNT; instead a C-terminal region of p160 proteins, just proximal to the p300/CBP binding AD1 domain, binds to the bHLH-PAS domains of AHR and ARNT (13Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether a GRIP1ΔN mutant lacking the bHLH-PAS domain could enhance AHR·ARNT function and cooperate with CoCoA. The GRIP1ΔN mutant enhanced AHR·ARNT function in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, assays 4 and data not shown). Furthermore, coexpression of CoCoA with the GRIP1ΔN mutant further potentiated the activity of AHR (Fig. 3B, assays 8–9). Thus, the bHLH-PAS domain of GRIP1 is not required for the coactivator function of CoCoA with AHR. These data are consistent with the conclusion that CoCoA interacts directly as a primary coactivator with AHR and ARNT. This result contrasts starkly with the secondary coactivator function of CoCoA with NRs, which depends entirely on the presence of a p160 coactivator with an intact N-terminal region (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The C-terminal segment of CoCoA (amino acids 501–691) possesses very strong autonomous transcriptional activation activity when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and is necessary for the coactivator function of CoCoA with NRs (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The CoCoA mutant lacking the C-terminal activation domain failed to enhance AHR function (Fig. 3B, assay 5). CoCoA Enhances the Transcriptional Activity of ARNT—To further investigate a functional interaction between ARNT and CoCoA, we tested the effect of CoCoA expression on ARNT-mediated transactivation in a mammalian one-hybrid system. In transiently transfected HEK 293T cells the strong autonomous transactivation activity of a Gal4 DBD-ARNT fusion protein was further enhanced (up to 4-fold) by co-expression of CoCoA (Fig. 4, assays 4–6). Because the bHLH-PAS domain of ARNT mediates protein interaction with CoCoA (Fig. 2C), we tested the effect of CoCoA overexpression on the activity of Gal4-ARNT-N, which harbors the bHLH-PAS motif. Gal4-ARNT-N possesses very little autonomous transcriptional activation activity on a transiently transfected Gal4-responsive reporter plasmid in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 4, assays 7 and 9), consistent with studies indicating the requirement for the ARNT C-terminal activation domain for fully activated transcription (21Corton J.C. Moreno E.S. Hovis S.M. Leonard L.S. Gaido K.W. Joyce M.M. Kennett S.B. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 139: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, co-expression of CoCoA increased luciferase activity by up to 7-fold (assays 9–11). Thus, CoCoA interacts with the bHLH-PAS domain of ARNT and is a potent coactivator for ARNT. CoCoA Is Specifically Targeted to the CYP1A1 XRE Region— ChIP assays were used to test whether CoCoA is recruited to the XREs of known AHR target genes. The CYP1A1 gene from mouse Hepa-1 cells has a well characterized regulatory region that responds to TCDD. Hepa-1 cells were treated either with 10 nm TCDD in Me2SO or with Me2SO vehicle. The cross-linked, sheared chromatin preparations were subjected to immunoprecipitation with various antibodies, and the precipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR amplification of the XRE region of the CYP1A1 promoter. TCDD treatment caused recruitment of AHR and GRIP1 to the CYP1A1 promoter region (Fig. 5), as shown previously (13Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11821-11827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, antibodies against CoCoA efficiently immunoprecipitated the XRE region of the CYP1A1 promoter from the TCDD-treated but not from the control cells, indicating the dioxin-dependent recruitment of CoCoA to the CYP1A1 promoter. Normal IgG failed to precipitate the CYP1A1 promoter. In contrast to the CYP1A1 promoter, the β-actin promoter region was not detected in association with AHR, GRIP1, or CoCoA. Thus, endogenous CoCoA was recruited to a native AHR-regulated promoter in a TCDD-dependent fashion, demonstrating a functional interaction between AHR and CoCoA occurring in an in vivo setting. Requirement for Endogenous CoCoA for Transcriptional Activation by AHR and ARNT—If CoCoA is a coactivator for AHR·ARNT, reducing the endogenous level of CoCoA should decrease the transcriptional activity of endogenous AHR and ARNT. In RNA interference experiments using a CoCoA-specific siRNA that was previously demonstrated to be effective in reducing CoCoA expression level (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), transfection of the Co-CoA-directed siRNA, but not a control scrambled-sequence siRNA, into Hepa-1 cells reduced the level of endogenous Co-CoA mRNA but had no effect on the β-actin mRNA level (Fig. 6A). TCDD-induced expression of the endogenous CYP1A1 gene was inhibited (more than 40%) by the CoCoA-directed siRNA, but the scrambled-sequence siRNA had no effect. To our surprise we also found that dioxin up-regulated the CoCoA mRNA level greater than 2-fold (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). Analysis of the mouse CoCoA gene (LocusLink locus ID 67488) for core AHR/ARNT binding sequences using the web-based TRANSFAC data base (23Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhauser R. Pruss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) revealed one such sequence (tgcCACGCtgagtcca) and two putative ARNT binding sequences (CACGTG) within 2 kilobases upstream of the Co-CoA transcription start site. Thus, the CoCoA gene is apparently dioxin-responsive. The physiological significance of CoCoA in ARNT function was further tested by RNA interference in COS-7 cells. The siRNA against CoCoA, but not the scrambled-sequence siRNA, specifically reduced the level of endogenous CoCoA mRNA but not β-actin mRNA (Fig. 6B, inset). Reduction of CoCoA levels in COS-7 cells also reduced activity of a Gal4 DBD-ARNT fusion protein by more than 65% but had little or no effect on the activity of Gal4 DBD (Fig. 6B) Thus, endogenous CoCoA is required for efficient transcriptional activation by AHR and ARNT. The results from ChIP and RNAi assays strongly support a physiological role for CoCoA in AHR/ARNT-dependent transcription. CoCoA Is a Primary Coactivator for AHR·ARNT—CoCoA was initially identified as a novel type of NR coactivator with a coiled-coil domain (17Kim J.H. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CoCoA binds to the bHLH-PAS domain of p160 coactivators but not directly to NRs, and the ability of CoCoA to enhance the activity of steroid receptors is highly dependent on the presence of a p160 coactivator with an intact N-terminal bHLH-PAS domain. By these characteristics, Co-CoA is classified as a secondary coactivator for nuclear receptors (16Stallcup M.R. Kim J.H. Teyssier C. Lee Y.H. Ma H. Chen D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, CoCoA bound to AHR and ARNT in vitro and in vivo and functioned as a coactivator for AHR and ARNT without co-expression of p160 coactivators or any other exogenously expressed proteins (Figs. 1 and 3). Thus, CoCoA binds indirectly to NRs and functions as a secondary coactivator for them but appears to bind directly to AHR·ARNT and serves as a primary coactivator for AHR·ARNT. The transient transfection data indicate that CoCoA has the activity of a coactivator for AHR·ARNT under those conditions. Under more physiologically relevant conditions endogenous CoCoA was efficiently recruited together with AHR to the endogenous CYP1A1 promoter in a TCDD-dependent fashion (Fig. 5) and was required for efficient TCDD induction of the endogenous CYP1A1 gene by AHR and for the autonomous transcriptional activation activity of ARNT (Fig. 6). These findings demonstrate that CoCoA is a physiologically relevant part of transcriptional activation by AHR·ARNT. Interestingly, we observed that the CoCoA mRNA level was up-regulated more than 2-fold by TCDD. Obviously, the resulting increase in CoCoA may further enhance AHR·ARNT activity. The regulation of CoCoA by ligand-activated AHR·ARNT is an additional physiological link between CoCoA and AHR·ARNT. The mechanism by which AHR·ARNT regulates CoCoA levels may involve direct binding of AHR·ARNT to the CoCoA gene promoter, since a putative AHR·ARNT binding sequence occurs within the proximal CoCoA promoter. Thus CoCoA and AHR·ARNT mutually regulate each other; AHR·ARNT regulates CoCoA levels, and Co-CoA serves as a coactivator for AHR·ARNT. Interaction of CoCoA with Mulitple Classes of bHLH-PAS Proteins—The interaction between CoCoA and AHR appears to be direct and involves two distinct regions within AHR, the N-terminal bHLH-PAS domain and a second site within the C-terminal activation domain (Fig. 2B). AHR bound CoCoA in a ligand-independent manner, suggesting that CoCoA may exist in a complex with AHR before ligand activation and after ligand binding travels with AHR to its target promoter. CoCoA and AHR are both recruited to the CYP1A1 promoter in a TCDD-dependent manner (Fig. 5), and CoCoA fails to enhance the activity of the CYP1A1 promoter in the absence of TCDD (Fig. 3). The ligand-independent association of AHR with Co-CoA and other coactivators (13Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G.

Unlike the steroid receptors, where the ligand binding pocket and the important AF-2 activation function are part of the same structural domain, the major C-terminal activation domain of AHR is well separated from the N-terminal ligand binding domain; this may allow ligand-independent interactions between activation domain and coactivators. In contrast to the situation with AHR, CoCoA interacts with the bHLH-PAS domain but not with the activation domain of ARNT (Fig. 2C). These observations are consistent with previous reports which indicate that deletion of the C-terminal activation domain of ARNT failed to have a significant effect on activation of a reporter gene under control of the CYP1A1 enhancer and promoter, leading to the conclusion that the activation domain of AHR is dominant over that of ARNT during transcriptional activation (24Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 25Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In general, the bHLH-PAS superfamily can be divided into three subgroups; members of one group are regulated in their expression or activity by binding of ligands or by cellular conditions (AHR, hypoxia-inducible factor, Single-minded (SIM), and Trachealess (TRH)); the second subgroup is ARNT, which does not need activation and has a central role in dimerization with members of group 1; the third subgroup is the p160 coactivators, which are not known to bind DNA directly but rather function as coactivators for diverse types of DNA binding transcription factors. CoCoA interacts with members of all three subgroups and enhances their activities as transcription factors or coactivators. These findings suggest that CoCoA may function as a general coactivator for all the bHLH-PAS transcriptional activators and may help us to understand the transactivation mechanisms of the bHLH-PAS protein family. Future studies of the interaction between CoCoA and the bHLH-PAS proteins may generate insights into regulation of genes involved in responses to hypoxia, circadian rhythms, development, and other pathways. Implications of CoCoA as a Common Coactivator for NRs and for AHR·ARNT—The fact that CoCoA serves as a common coactivator for two different classes of DNA binding transcription factors suggests a novel avenue for cross-talk between these two signaling pathways. It is interesting to note that TCDD inhibits several estrogen-dependent biological responses, decreases cellular estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor levels (26Ahlborg U.G. Lipworth L.

Toxicol. 1995; 25: 463-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and inhibits transcription of estrogen-regulated genes (27Porter W. Wang F. Duan R. Qin C. Castro-Rivera E. Kim K. Safe S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 26: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Conversely, 17β-estradiol (E2) can inhibit TCDD-induced reporter gene activity (28Kharat I. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10533-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The possible mechanisms proposed for inhibitory AHR-ER cross-talk include induction of inhibitory factors, enhanced E2 metabolism, proteasome-dependent degradation of ERα by non-genomic inhibitory effects of AHR, and competition for common nuclear coactivators (29Safe S. Wormke M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Recent studies report that TCDD-induced interactions between AHR and ERα enhance ubiquitylation of ERα and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation of ERα (30Wormke M. Stoner M. Saville B.

NRs and AHR·ARNT have been reported to interact with many common coactivators and components of the transcription machinery, including CoCoA, p160 coactivators (13Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W.

In addition, a recent study has shown that ARNT, the obligatory heterodimerization partner for AHR, also functions as a coactivator of ERα and ERβ (34Brunnberg S. Pettersson K. Rydin E. Matthews J. Hanberg A. Pongratz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Some transcription factors have been reported to compete with one another for binding with limiting coactivators, resulting in mutually antagonistic effects (35Meyer M.E. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel M.T. Tasset D. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 36Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A.

Competition for binding and squelching of these limiting common coactivators could be one of the mechanisms for the anti-estrogenic activity of TCDD. Our results add an additional possibility that cellular availability of CoCoA may also be an important factor in regulating ER and AHR transcriptional activities. We thank Drs.

In conclusion, GP2 is not essential for pancreatic exocrine secretion or zymogen granule formation. It is unlikely that GP2 serves a major intracellular role within the pancreatic acinar cell and may be functionally active after it is secreted from the pancreas. The exocrine pancreas is the major organ responsible for the luminal digestion of food within the intestine. Acinar cells within the pancreas produce digestive enzymes that are stored within large secretory granules, also known as zymogen granules, until the cell is stimulated to secrete with neuronal or hormonal stimulation (1Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). GP2 is specifically expressed by the pancreatic acinar cell and is the major membrane protein present in pancreatic zymogen granules (2Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J. Biol.

GP2 possesses multiple sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation, a ZP domain, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; CDE, choline-deficient ethionine-enriched.1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; CDE, choline-deficient ethionine-enriched. linkage to the membrane. During the secretory process, GP2 is cleaved from the membrane and secreted into the pancreatic duct along with other digestive enzymes (2Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. J. Biol.

In vitro experiments using purified proteins or primary pancreatic cultures support a role for GP2 in digestive enzyme secretion. Studies using isolated secretory proteins have demonstrated an affinity between GP2 and amylase, as well as other secretory proteins present within the zymogen granule. In vitro, proteins derived from the zymogen granule aggregate in low pH conditions, similar to the environment within the trans-Golgi network where digestive enzymes are packaged into secretory granules (9Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Dartsch H. Kleene R. Kern H.F. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, GP2 aggregation with secretory proteins is specific for those derived from exocrine but not endocrine tissues (12Colomer V. Lai K. Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3711-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GP2 also associates with other proteins within the zymogen granule to form a submembranous matrix that may be involved in zymogen granule formation and protein sorting (14Scheele G.A. Fukuoka S.-I. Freedman S.D. Pancreas. 1994; 9: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Schmidt K. Dartsch H. Linder D. Kern H.-F. Kleene R. J.

GP2-associated proteins identified by purification of the submembranous matrix or cross-linking studies include ZG16p, ZG46p, syncollin, and a number of unidentified proteoglycans. Studies using primary pancreatic cultures also support a role for GP2 in secretion. Similar to other GPI-anchored proteins, GP2 is associated with lipid rafts (17Schmidt K. Schrader M. Kern H.-F. Kleene R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14315-14323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The lipid rafts are enriched in glycosphingolipids and believed to participate in sorting GPI-anchored proteins to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelia. When formation of the lipid raft is disrupted with cholesterol depletion, constitutive secretion of amylase increases, suggesting that sorting to the zymogen granule is perturbed. Likewise, when GP2 attachment to membrane is disrupted with mannosamine or YW3548, the amount of newly synthesized protein present in zymogen granules is reduced and the amount in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus is increased. The same treatment also resulted in malformed zymogen granules, suggesting that in addition to protein packaging, GP2 also participates in zymogen granule formation or stability (17Schmidt K. Schrader M. Kern H.-F. Kleene R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14315-14323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, GP2's absence during zymogen granule formation in the embryo or in pancreatic exocrine cell lines argue against a significant role in protein sorting or granule formation (3Dittie A. Kern H.-F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 243-258PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the conflicting data and the potentially significant role GP2 may possess in pancreatic exocrine secretion, a GP2-deficient mouse was produced to examine its biologic role. Generation of GP2-deficient Mice—Murine pancreatic total RNA was purified as described previously (18Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Two primers derived from the rat GP2 nucleotide sequence (nucleotides 44–65 and nucleotides 1732–1753, GenBank™ accession number M58716) that bracket the open reading frame were used to generate murine GP2 cDNA by reverse transcription followed by the PCR. The nucleotide sequence was determined for both stands of the PCR product. GP2-containing genomic DNA was obtained by screening a 129/SVj II BAC library (IncyteGenomics, Palo Alto, CA). Using the isolated murine GP2 cDNA as a probe, two BAC clones were isolated, one of which encompassed most of the GP2 open reading frame. Genomic sequencing and mapping of GP2 gene was performed and used for construction of the targeting vector (Fig. 1). A commercial targeting vector, pKO Scrambler NTKV-1903 (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA), containing elements for positive (neomycin) and negative (thymidine kinase) selection was used to construct the targeting vector. The neomycin selection marker was flanked by a 3.6-kb EcoRI fragment that contains exon 1 but is proximal to exon 2, which contains the start codon, and a 4.0-kb ClaI/SacII fragment that contains exons 6–8. The SacII site was derived from the BAC cloning vector. The targeting vector was introduced by electroporation into R1 embryonal stem cells derived from a 129/Svj × 129/Sv background followed by selection with G418 and ganciclovir. Drug-resistant clones were screened using PCR and Southern blots (Fig. 1). Three individual clones were selected and injected into pseudopregnant mice. The resultant chimeric mice were bred with C57BL/6J mice. Germ line transmission of the mutated GP2 gene was confirmed with PCR and Southern blots. GP2 heterozygotes were intercrossed to produce homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type mice for the GP2 gene. Genotype was determined by PCR using primer pairs specific for wild-type (5′-GAGATGTAGAAGCAATGGCAGGTGTCGTATGC-3′ and 5′-ATTGTAGATGGAGATACCAGTGTCAGAACG-3′, 8.0-kb product) and mutant (5′-GAGATGTAGAAGCAATGGCAGGTGTCGTATGC-3′ and 5′-AAGCCGGTCTTGTCAATCAGGATGATCTGGACG-3′, 5.0-kb product) mice using LA TaqDNA polymerase (Takara Biomedical, Shuzo Co., Ltd., Shiga, Japan). The positive candidates were further confirmed by Southern hybridization using a 0.6-kb PstI fragment 1.8-kb 5′ to the EcoRI fragment used in the targeting vector. After digestion of genomic DNA with XbaI, mutant GP2 DNA produces an 8.0-kb fragment and wild-type GP2 results in a 10.0-kb fragment (Fig. 1B). The presence of GP2 mRNA was also determined using reverse transcription-PCR. PCR primers were derived from nucleotides 308–328 and the reverse complement of 753–774 (5′-TCCCTGCCAGAATCACACGGT-3′and 5′-GGAGGTCCTGCCTACAGACACA-3′, GenBank™ accession number NM 025989). Murine β-actin served as a positive control using primers 5′-AGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAGCACTTGCGGTGCACGATGGAGGGG-3′ (GenBank™ accession number NM 007393). Immunohistology—The pancreas was excised and embedded in Optimum Cutting Temperature compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan) for cryosection. Six-micrometer cryostat sections were processed as described previously (19Braun J.E.A. Fritz B. Wong S.M.E. Lowe A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5328-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-human GP2 antisera that cross-reacts with murine GP2 (1:200 dilution) was used as the primary antibody (20Hao Y. Wang J. Feng N. Lowe A.W. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2004; 128: 668-674PubMed Google Scholar). Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used as the secondary antibody. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrocloride (1:10,000 dilution, Pierce) was used to stain the nuclei. Purification of Pancreatic Zymogen Granules—Zymogen granules were isolated from mice that were age-matched and with identical genetic backgrounds as previously described (19Braun J.E.A. Fritz B. Wong S.M.E. Lowe A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5328-5335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Isolation and Stimulated Secretion of Pancreatic Acini—Pancreatic acini from wild-type and knock-out mice were isolated using collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) digestion as described previously (21Menozzi D. Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The viability and stimulated secretion response were determined by measuring the extent of amylase release from isolated acini in the presence or absence of 1 nm cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8, Sigma) or 10 μm carbachol (Sigma). Amylase released into the culture media or in detergent cell lysates was measured using the Phadebas amylase tablets (Pharmacia & Upjohn Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The results were expressed as the percentage of total amylase in the acini. Immunoblotting—SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–20% gel) was performed as described previously (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm pore size) and probed with antibody as previously described (19Braun J.E.A. Fritz B. Wong S.M.E. Lowe A.W. J. Biol.

Edwardson, University of Cambridge, Cambridge), rabbit anti-rat muclin antisera (1:5,000 dilution, kindly provided by Robert C. De Lisle, University of Kansas), and rabbit anti-human amylase antibody (1:1,000 dilution, Sigma). The rabbit anti-rat ZG16p antisera was produced using a cDNA encoding a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein that incorporated amino acids 37–167 of rat ZG16p subcloned into vector pGEX-1λT (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, JM101, and affinity-purified on a reduced glutathione agarose column as described previously (24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). The resultant purified glutathione S-transferase/ZG16p fusion protein was injected into New Zealand White rabbits for the production of antiserum, which was used at 1:3,000 dilution for immunoblotting. Detection and quantitation of proteins labeled by the primary antibodies was achieved using second antibodies labeled with near infrared dyes that were measured using infrared fluorescence (Odyssey System, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis of Zymogen Granule Proteins— Zymogen granules (100 μg) isolated from wild-type and GP2-deficient mice were homogenized in a buffer consisting of 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, and 0.5% IPG buffer (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Supernatants were subjected to isoelectric focusing in the first dimensional with Immobilin DryStrip pI 3–10 gel strips (Amersham Biosciences). SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed in the second dimension using 11% acrylamide gels. Silver-stained proteins were quantified using PDQuest 2D gel analysis software (Bio-Rad). Experimentally Induced Pancreatitis—All mice were sex and age matched and the product of breeding heterozygotes. For the caerulein model, 6-month-old mice were fasted overnight followed by intraperitoneal injection with 50 μg/kg caerulein (Sigma) at hourly intervals for seven total injections. The mice were killed at 1, 6, 12, 36, 48, and 72 h and 6 days after the first injection. Five mice, two males and three females, were used for each time point. Older, 5-month-old female mice were used for the choline-deficient diet model to decrease mortality and potentially reveal less severe differences between the mice (25Lombardi B. Rao N.K. Am. J. Pathol. 1975; 81: 87-99PubMed Google Scholar). The mice were fasted overnight and then fed a powdered choline-deficient diet (Teklad, Madison, WI) supplemented with 0.75% dl-ethionine (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). Five mice from each genotype were killed 72 h after initiating the diet. At each specified time point, the mice were sacrificed and the pancreas were removed for pathology. Serum was collected for amylase and lipase assays, which was performed by the clinical laboratories at the Department of Comparative Medicine at Stanford University. Pancreatic tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embeded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Histotec Laboratory, Hayward, CA). Pancreatitis severity was assessed in a blinded manner by a single pathologist (S. A. Michie), who scored for the presence of vacuoles, cell death, edema, and inflammation as described previously (26Demols A. Van Laethem J.L. Quertinmont E. Legros F. Louis H. Le Moine O. Deviere J. Pancreas. 2000; 20: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural Analysis—For ultrastructural analysis, pancreata were minced into 1-mm3 pieces, immersion-fixed in 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer at 4 °C overnight, and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were thin-sectioned and poststained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h in the dark followed by visualization on an electron microscope (Phillips CM 12). Based on the murine GP2 nucleotide sequence obtained, analysis of the open reading frame revealed a nucleotide sequence that is 90% identical to that of rat GP2 and a predicted amino acid sequence that is 80% identical. The resultant murine GP2 sequence was used to generate a probe that enabled the isolation and characterization of murine genomic clones for GP2. A targeting vector was constructed that resulted in the replacement of exons 2–5 of the murine GP2 gene with cDNA encoding neomycin resistance for positive selection of embryonal stem cell clones. Exon 2 contains the predicted start codon. The total deletion encompasses 6,934 nucleotides of the GP2 gene, which represents amino acids 1–282 of the murine GP2 protein. The targeting vector was successfully used to produce three independent embryonal stem cell clones that were injected into blastocysts derived from C57BL/6J mice. Germ line transmission of the GP2 mutation was achieved. Intercross-breeding of heterozygotes was performed to produce wild-type, heterozygous, and GP2-deficient mice. GP2-deficient mice were successfully produced as confirmed by Southern blotting, PCR, and immunohistology of pancreatic tissues (Fig. 1). Heterozygous breeding produced mice in the expected distribution for Mendelian genetics. Over 18 months, the GP2-deficient mice show no gross differences in development, growth, weight, behavior, and life span compared with wild-type mice. The homozygous mutants were fertile and loss of exocrine pancreatic function, as characterized by weight loss or diarrhea, was not observed. Light microscopy of GP2-deficient murine pancreata revealed no apparent differences from wild-type mice (Fig. 2). Electron microscopy was also employed to assess the subcellular morphology of the pancreatic acinar cells. Pancreata derived from GP2-deficient mice displayed no quantitative changes in zymogen granule size, number, or density. Purified zymogen granules from mutant and non-mutant mice were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis to evaluate for changes in zymogen granule protein content. No significant changes in protein composition were detected (Fig. 3A). All of the major digestive enzymes were present. Amylase was quantified using immunoblotting because binding to GP2 has been described previously. When normalized to the total zymogen granule protein, there was no significant difference in pancreatic amylase content between GP2-deficient and wild-type mice. Whether proteins known to interact with GP2 are affected in GP2-deficient mice was also determined. Cross-linking studies previously determined an association between syncollin and GP2 (16Kalus I. Hodel A. Koch A. Kleene R. Edwardson J.M. Schrader M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ZG16p and GP2 are both major constituents of the submembranous matrix purfied from zymogen granules, potentially serving a role in protein sorting or granule formation (15Schmidt K. Dartsch H. Linder D. Kern H.-F. Kleene R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2233-2242PubMed Google Scholar). Muclin is a membrane protein present in the zymogen granule that also contains a ZP domain and has also been proposed to play a role in protein sorting (27Al-Aynati M.M. Radulovich N. Riddell R.H. Tsao M.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When quantitative protein immunoblotting was performed to compare the relative amounts of syncollin, ZG16p, and muclin to amylase in zymogen granules, there was no significant difference between wild-type and GP2-deficient mice (Fig. 3C). Mutant mice deficient in syncollin or ITMAP1 have been produced (28Antonin W. Wagner M. Riedel D. Brose N. Jahn R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Imamura T. Asada M. Vogt S.K. Rudnick D.A. Lowe M.E. Muglia L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50725-50733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ITMAP1 is another zymogen granule membrane protein that possesses a ZP domain. A common trait among the knock-out mice that have been produced for both genes is increased severity of experimentally induced pancreatitis. Thus the GP2-deficient mice were subjected to two different models of experimental pancreatitis, the caerulein and choline-deficient diet models of pancreatitis. High levels of the secretagogue caerulein are known to induce a mild form of pancreatitis characterized by edema and inflammation (30Lampel M. Kern H.-F. Virchows Arch. A. 1977; 373: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Caerulein, an analog of cholecystokinin, was used to induce pancreatitis. The presence of pancreatitis was documented by elevations in plasma amylase and lipase levels and by histologic analysis. Plasma pancreatic enzyme levels peaked at 12 h after caerulein injections were initiated (Fig. 4). No significant differences in serum amylase or lipase levels were found between wild-type and GP2-deficient mice. GP2-deficient mice exhibited significantly higher numbers of necrotic cells than their wild-type counterpart at 6 h (Fig. 5 and Table I). At other time points, there were no significant differences in histologic scoring between wild-type and GP2-deficient mice.Fig. 5Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of pancreata from caerulein (cae)- and CDE (cde)-induced pancreatitis. +/+, wild-type mice; -/-, GP2-deficient mice. Mice were sacrificed 6–72 h after caerulein treatment. Many dead acinar cells with pyknotic nuclei and indistinct cytoplasm borders were seen at 6, 12, and 36 h in the wild-type and GP2 knock-out mice (arrows in 6h photos). Edema was most pronounced in both strains at 12 h, while inflammatory cells were prominent at 36 h (arrows in 36h photos). Pancreata of mice given a CDE diet reveal cytoplasmic vacuoles (arrowheads) and dead acinar cells (arrows).

The mice were sacrificed at 72 h for analysis, by which time one out of five wild-type and none of the 5 GP2-deficient mice had died.

Primary isolated acini were cultured from GP2-deficient and wild-type mice and stimulated with cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) or carbachol. The amount of amylase released into the culture supernatant after stimulation for 15 or 60 min with CCK-8 or carbachol did not differ between GP2-deficient and wild-type mice (Fig. 6). GP2-deficient mice were produced in this study to determine the role of GP2 in the exocrine pancreas. Numerous studies have supported a role for GP2 in zymogen granule formation and secretory protein sorting. Definitive evidence that GP2 is necessary for these secretory processes has not been possible in the experimental systems used to date. The GP2-deficient mice permitted studies that establishes that zymogen granule formation and digestive enzyme packaging is not GP2 dependent. In addition, the ability to secrete digestive enzymes in response to secretagogue also appeared unaffected. Whether other proteins that have been established to physically interact with GP2 or are co-localized within the same domain within the granule are affected by the absence of GP2 was also examined. No changes in the zymogen granule content of syncollin, ZG16p, or muclin were detected in the homozygous mutants. Thus none of the proteins examined depend on GP2 for their sorting to the zymogen granule. Likewise, an increase in the zymogen granule content of any proteins that may compensate for the absence of GP2 was also not observed as determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Previous studies had established that inhibition of the formation of the glycosylphophatidylinositol linkage or cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains lead to aberrant formation of zymogen granules and the sorting of secretory proteins to the organelle (17Schmidt K. Schrader M. Kern H.-F. Kleene R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14315-14323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The experiments described in this work indicate that the results obtained in the previously performed studies are unlikely due to perturbation of GP2. The results are also consistent with recent work that studied the effects of GP2 overexpression in the acinar cell line AR4-2J, which found no impact of GP2 expression on secretory granule formation or cholecystokinin stimulated secretion (32Yu S. Hao Y. Lowe A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Whether other glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins present in zymogen granule such as muclin are responsible for potential protein sorting functions or organelle formation remains to be definitively determined. Although mice deficient in syncollin and ITMAP1 have shown increased susceptability to experimentally induced pancreatitis, the results in the GP2-deficinet mice were mixed. Only GP2-deficient mice treated with supramaximal concentrations of caerulein displayed significantly more necrotic cells. In contrast, only in wild-type mice did the CDE-induced pancreatitis result in mortality (one mouse). Thus the effects of experimental pancreatitis resulted in subtle differences, if any, between the wild-type and GP2-deficient mice. Uromodulin is the protein most similar to GP2. It is specifically expressed in the kidney and shares with GP2 a 52% identity in amino acid sequence, the presence of a ZP domain, and a glycophosphatidylinositol-linkage to the membrane (33Pennica D. Kohr W.J. Kuang W.-J. Glaister D. Aggarwal B.B. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1987; 236: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Similar to GP2, uromodulin is secreted following its cleavage from the membrane (34Rindler M.J. Naik S.S. Li N. Hoops T.C. Peraldi M.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20784-20789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two independent laboratories recently generated homozygous mutants for uromodulin and found uromodulin deficiency led to greater susceptibility to infection by E. coli that possess Type 1 fimbriae as a virulence factor (35Mo L. Zhu X.H. Huang H.Y. Shapiro E. Hasty D.L. Wu X.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F795-F802Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 36Bates J.M. Raffi H.M. Prasadan K. Mascarenhas R. Laszik Z. Maeda N. Hultgren S.J. Kumar S. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 791-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The data support a role for uromodulin in host cell defense against infection by binding to E. coli and preventing bacterial adherence to the host cell. In view of the minimal effects of the GP2 mutation on normal pancreatic morphology and physiology, it is plausible that GP2 serves a similar or alternative extracellular function in the pancreas.

Agents that block mitotic progression and cell proliferation by interfering with microtubule dynamics (microtubule-targeted tubulin-polymerizing agents (MTPAs)) are powerful antitumor agents. Effects of MTPAs (e.g. paclitaxel) on microtubule dynamics have not yet been directly demonstrated in intact animals, however. Here we describe a method that measures microtubule dynamics as an exchange of tubulin dimers into microtubules in vivo. The incorporation of deuterium (2H2) from heavy water (2H O) into tubulin dimers and polymers is measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In cultured human lung and breast cancer cell lines, or in tumors implanted into nude mice, tubulin dimers and polymerized microtubules exhibited nearly identical label incorporation rates, reflecting their rapid exchange. Administration of paclitaxel during 24 h of 2H2O labeling in vivo reduced 2H labeling in polymers while increasing 2H in dimers, indicating diminished flux of dimers into polymers (i.e. inhibition of microtubule dynamic equilibrium). In vivo inhibition of microtubule dynamics was dose-dependent and correlated with inhibition of DNA replication, a stable isotopic measure of tumor cell growth. In contrast, microtubule polymers from sciatic nerve of untreated mice were not in dynamic equilibrium with tubulin dimers, and paclitaxel increased label incorporation into polymers. Our results directly demonstrate altered microtubule dynamics as an important action of MTPAs in vivo. This sensitive and quantitative in vivo assay of microtubule dynamics may prove useful for pre-clinical and clinical development of the next generation of MTPAs as anticancer drugs.

In eukaryotic cells, microtubules exist in a state of dynamic instability. Tubulin dimers, consisting of α and β monomers, are believed to cycle rapidly through polymerization as microtubules and depolymerization back to dimers. This dynamic instability is important for many functions of microtubules, particularly mitosis (1Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). During interphase, many microtubules appear static, although others alternately extend and shorten (2Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar, 3Belmont L.D. Hyman A.A. Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1990; 62: 579-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), and yet others may engage in treadmilling, i.e. simultaneous growth at plus ends and shrinkage at minus ends (4Rodionov V.I.

During mitosis, the interphase microtubule array is disassembled, and a bipolar spindle is assembled, connecting the microtubule organizing centers to the kinetochores of chromosomes. Rearrangement of the microtubule network upon entry into mitosis involves a 10–100-fold increase in the number of microtubule ends undergoing growth and shrinkage (7Pepperkok R. Bre M.H. Davoust J.

Because microtubules are in dynamic equilibrium with their subunits, normal cell function requires the maintenance of a specific free tubulin dimer/microtubule polymer ratio, and changes in this ratio have been associated with alterations in several cellular activities (8Zhai Y.

MTPAs either can promote the formation of alternate lattice contacts and polymers at microtubule ends (e.g. colchicines, vinca alkaloids, cryptophycin-52) or they can stabilize existing microtubule polymers and interfere with their disassembly (e.g. epothilone A and paclitaxel) (15Dhamodharan R.I.

Paclitaxel strongly inhibits HeLa cell proliferation at low concentrations that suppress microtubule dynamics but do not promote microtubule growth or bundling (14Jordan M.A Toso R.J. Thrower D.

Thus, suppression of microtubule dynamics, rather than the stimulation of microtubule polymerization, appears to be the key antiproliferative mechanism. Much of our understanding of intracellular microtubule dynamics and the effects of MTPAs is based on studies in vitro (35Salmon E.D. McKeel M. Hays T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1066-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 36Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J.

These studies are based on measurements of assembly/disassembly of purified tubulin, using 32P pulse-chase labeling and fluorescence microscopy of cultured cells to track the incorporation of labeled tubulin into microtubules, and on Western blot analysis to detect accumulation or loss of free tubulin and microtubules (5Grego S.

Biophys. 2003; 38: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Extending these studies to intact animals has been more challenging. Whereas Western blots have been used to quantify changes in the ratio of free tubulin to microtubules in vivo (39Zhou B.B Kirschner M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 41Hamel E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 38: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 42Zhai Y. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 881-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no method exists to measure in vivo rates and extents of tubulin/microtubule exchange. Changes in the tubulin to microtubule ratio underestimate the effect of MTPAs on microtubule dynamics, however, because drug-induced microtubule stabilization up-regulates de novo synthesis of free tubulin (43Cleveland D.W. Lopata M.A. Sherline P. Kirschner M. Cell. 1981; 25: 537-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 44Cleveland D. Curr. Opin.

To address these issues, we describe here a stable isotope/mass spectrometric method for direct measurement of the overall microtubule dynamics in living cells and tissue. This approach evaluates microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics as the ratio of biosynthetic label incorporation into tubulin dimers and polymers. Cell Culture—The human epithelial cell lines MCF-7 (derived from a mammary carcinoma) and SW1573 (from a lung carcinoma) were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were subcultured using 0.25% trypsin (Sigma) once (MCF-7) or twice (SW1573) a week. For drug treatments, cells were maintained in logarithmic growth and plated 48 h before addition of 0.4 μm paclitaxel (diluted from 1 mm stock in Me2SO). The final concentration of Me2SO in the culture was <0.01% (47Vredenburg M.R. Ojima I. Veith J. Pera P. Kee K. Cabral F. Sharma A. Kanter P. Greco W.R. Bernacki R.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1234-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For IC50 measurements, cell survival was measured 24 h after addition of paclitaxel, using a commercial 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test kit (Sigma) as described previously (48Romijn J.C. Verkoelen C.F. Schroeder F.H. Prostate. 1988; 12: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For labeling studies, culture media, as well as the humidified incubator, were adjusted to 4 mol % heavy water (2H2O) by addition of >99% 2H2O (Spectra Stable Isotopes, Columbia, MD), concurrently with paclitaxel treatment, and maintained at this 2H enrichment up to 36 h. Animal Studies—Female BALB/c nude (nu/nu) mice (Charles River laboratories, Wilmington, MA), 4–6 weeks old, were kept in a specific pathogen-free facility with controlled light-dark cycle, temperature, and humidity. Cages, bedding, food, and water were autoclaved prior to use. Housing was in groups of five mice per cage. Feeding was ad libitum with Purina® rodent chow. All studies received prior institutional approval. Subconfluent cultures of tumor cells were harvested and counted using trypan blue; 5 × 106 cells were suspended in Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and injected subcutaneously into the right flank. Xenografted mice developed palpable tumors about 1000 mm3 in diameter within 10 days after tumor inoculation. At this time, groups of three mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of paclitaxel (up to 10 mg/kg in a 1:1 mixture of ethanol/cremophor EL) or with vehicle alone. For 2H2O labeling, mice then received an intraperitoneal bolus of 30–35 ml/kg 2H2O (99.9 mol % 2H2O) containing 0.9% w/v NaCl (Cambridge Isotope laboratory, Andover MA), resulting in 4–5% body water 2H enrichment, and were maintained on 8% 2H2O in drinking water (to allow for dilution of label by metabolic water) for 24 h prior to sacrifice (49Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Kim Y.K. Schade-Serin V. Collins M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 356Google Scholar, 50Hellerstein M. Metab. Eng. 2004; 6: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The animals tolerated the treatments well, and there were no differences in body weight among animals in different groups (not shown). Isolation of Tubulin Dimers and Polymers—Tubulin was purified using minor modifications of protocols described previously (51Fanara P. Oback B. Ashman K. Podtelejnikov A. Brandt R. EMBO J. 1998; 18: 565-577Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 52Fanara P. Brandt R. Avila J. Brandt R. Kosik K. Brain Microtubule-associated Proteins: Modification in Disease. Harwood Press, Amsterdam1997: 259-273Google Scholar). Briefly, for protein isolations from cultured tumor cells, 4 × 106 cultured cells were gently scraped off 245-mm culture plates, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and homogenized in microtubule-stabilizing buffer. For purification ex vivo, tumor-bearing mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation without anesthesia, tumors and sciatic nerves were dissected rapidly, and tissue samples (0.2 g of tumor or 0.01 g of sciatic nerve) were gently homogenized in microtubule-stabilizing buffer. To separate cytosolic tubulin dimers from microtubule polymers, postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 190,000 × g at 20 °C for 35 min. The supernatant or non-microtubule fraction (containing the soluble dimeric tubulin) and the pellet or microtubule fraction (containing polymeric tubulin) were separated, quick-frozen, and stored at –20 °C. The relative abundance of tubulin in total, dimer, or polymer fractions was determined by Western blotting for α-tubulin (monoclonal antibody DM1A, Sigma) followed by anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) with enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences) as described (51Fanara P. Oback B. Ashman K. Podtelejnikov A. Brandt R. EMBO J. 1998; 18: 565-577Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 53Ilschner S. Brandt R.

Band intensities on film exposures in the linear range were quantified using densitometry. Purification of tubulin from the nonmicrotubule fraction was accomplished by DEAE-ion exchange chromatography (DEAE-825 column, Phenomenex) eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in microtubule-destabilizing buffer followed by size exclusion chromatography (BioSep SEC-S 2000 column, Phenomenex). Purification of tubulin from the microtubule fraction was performed similarly, except that microtubules were first depolymerized by incubation in microtubule-destabilizing buffer. Chromatography was performed using a Waters (Milford, MA) HPLC system. Purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting for α-tubulin with enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Purified tubulin fractions were quick-frozen and stored at –20 °C. Isolation of Colonocytes and Bone Marrow Cells—Bone marrow cells were flushed from tibias and femurs with sterile PBS using a 1-ml syringe with an 18-gauge needle. Colonocytes were isolated from mouse colon tissue by a protocol modified from Kim et al. (55Kim S.J. Cheung S. Hellerstein M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, colon was dissected and digested in PBS containing 75 units/ml of collagenase type 2 (Worthington) and 10 μg/ml DNase (Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C for 40 min. Dissociated cells were collected and centrifuged at 800 × g at room temperature for 5 min. Pellets were gently suspended in 45% Percoll, loaded on top of a 75:45% (v/v) Percoll, 1.6% JKMEM in PBS (Sigma) gradient, and centrifuged at 350 × g for 30 min at room temperature. Colonocytes were collected from the top of the gradient, washed with PBS, and filtered through a 35-μm sterile filter. Processing of DNA for GC/MS Analysis—Extraction, hydrolysis, and derivatization of DNA from tumor tissue, bone marrow, and colonocytes was performed as described previously (56McCune J.M. Hanley M.B.

Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). GC/MS analysis in negative chemical ionization mode was performed as described (58Misell L.M. Hwang E.S. Au A. Esserman L. Hellerstein M.K. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). 2H enrichment was calculated as the percent increase, over natural abundance, in the percentage of purine deoxyribose derivative present as the (M + 1) mass isotopomer (58Misell L.M. Hwang E.S. Au A. Esserman L. Hellerstein M.K. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 59Neese R.A. Siler S.Q. Cesar D. Antelo F. Lee D. Misell L. Patel K. Tehrani S. Shah P. Hellerstein M.K. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Inhibition of fractional DNA synthesis was calculated as 1-2[H enrichment in a paclitaxel-treated sample/2H enrichment in control sample] and was expressed as a percentage. Processing of Tubulin for GC/MS Analysis—Tubulin samples were hydrolyzed by treatment with 6 n HCl for 16 h at 110 °C. Protein-derived amino acids were derivatized to pentafluorobenzyl derivatives, and 2H incorporation into alanine was measured by GC/MS as described in detail elsewhere 2Y. K. Kim, R. A. Neese, R. Busch, V. Schade-Serin, M. Collins, M. Awada, J. Gardner, L. M. Misell, and M. K. Hellerstein, submitted for publication. (49Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Kim Y.K. Schade-Serin V. Collins M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 356Google Scholar). 2H enrichment was calculated as the percent increase, over natural abundance, in the percentage of an alanine derivative present as the (M + 1) mass isotopomer. An index of microtubule dynamics was calculated as the ratio of 2H enrichment in polymer to 2H enrichment in dimer. Measurement of 2H2O Enrichment of in Body Water—Measurement of 2H2O enrichment in body water and culture media was done by using a modification of procedures described previously (58Misell L.M. Hwang E.S. Au A. Esserman L. Hellerstein M.K. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 60Previs S.F Hazey J.W. Diraison F. Beylot M. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, protons from plasma water were transferred to acetylene by reaction with calcium carbide. Acetylene samples were then analyzed using a Series 3000 cycloidal mass spectrometer (Monitor Instruments, Cheswick, PA), which was modified to record ions at m/z 26 and 27 (M0 and M1) and calibrated against a standard curve prepared by mixing 99.9% 2H2O with unlabeled water. Body water 2H enrichments were not affected by paclitaxel treatment (data not shown). General Principle of Stable Isotope Labeling Technique—One way to measure microtubule dynamics and the degree of equilibrium between tubulin dimers and microtubule polymers (the putative target of MTPAs) is through isotopic labeling. If an isotopic label is introduced into the tubulin dimer pool via endogenous synthesis of new α/β-tubulin dimers (50Hellerstein M. Metab. Eng. 2004; 6: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 62Cabral F. Abraham I. Gottesman M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4388-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it will rapidly distribute among both dimers and polymers and accumulate in both pools at the same rate, if dimers and polymers undergo rapid, dynamic exchange with each other (49Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Kim Y.K. Schade-Serin V. Collins M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 356Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). If, however, microtubules exchange slowly, or if dynamic exchange is disrupted by the action of MTPAs, accumulation of label in microtubules should lag behind label incorporation into tubulin dimers. Moreover, trapping of tubulin in polymer form by agents such as MTPAs might stimulate new biosynthesis of tubulin dimers (22Checchi P.M. Nettles J. Zhou J. Snyder J.P. Joshi H.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 361-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 44Cleveland D. Curr. Opin.

A. 2002; 99: 15345-15350Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar); this would further amplify the isotopic label incorporation rate into dimers and the disequilibrium relative to polymers (Fig. 1B). The development of a heavy water (2H2O) labeling technique for measuring protein synthesis provided an ideal means of testing these kinetic predictions regarding microtubules (49Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Kim Y.K. Schade-Serin V. Collins M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 356Google Scholar). 2H2O administration in vivo and in vitro results in a nearly immediate plateau in the 2H enrichment in body water, which remains relatively constant for days and weeks (64Collins M. Eng S. Hoh R. Hellerstein M.K. J. Appl. Physiol. 2003; 94: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 65Turner S. Neese R.A. Murphy E. Antelo F. Thomas T. Hellerstein M.K. Am. J.

A constant isotopic enrichment in the biosynthetic precursor pool for proteins greatly simplifies interpretation of the label incorporation relationship between dimer and polymer (Fig. 1). Moreover, 2H2O labeling is easily carried out for several days or longer, if necessary, and allows concurrent measurements of DNA replication and, thereby, cell proliferation (57Busch R. Cesar D. Higuera-Alhino D. Gee T. Hellerstein M.K. McCune J.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 286: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 58Misell L.M. Hwang E.S. Au A. Esserman L. Hellerstein M.K.

Biochem. 2001; 298: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The relationship between microtubule dynamics and cell division can therefore be measured through a single labeling protocol. Absence of 2H2O effects on Microtubules—To use 2H labeling as a probe of microtubule dynamics, we first had to establish that nontoxic doses of 2H2O (4–5% 2H2O in body water) routinely used for in vivo biosynthetic labeling (49Hellerstein M.K. Neese R.A. Kim Y.K. Schade-Serin V. Collins M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 356Google Scholar, 50Hellerstein M. Metab. Eng. 2004; 6: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 61Humphrey T.J.

This collagen subunit possesses an N-terminal domain (NTD) that contains a unique high affinity heparin binding site. The α4(V)-NTD is adhesive for Schwann cells and sensory neurons and is an excellent substrate for Schwann cell and axonal migration. Here we show that the α4(V)-NTD is released constitutively by Schwann cells both in culture and in vivo. In cultures of neonatal rat Schwann cells, α4(V)-NTD release is increased significantly by ascorbate treatment, which facilitates collagen post-translational modification and collagen trimer assembly. In peripheral nerve tissue, the α4(V)-NTD is localized to the region of the outer Schwann cell membrane and associated extracellular matrix. The released α4(V)-NTD binds to the cell surface and extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans of Schwann cells. Pull-down assays and immunofluorescent staining showed that the major α4(V)-NTD-binding proteins are glypican-1 and perlecan. α4(V)-NTD binding occurs via a mechanism that requires the high affinity heparin binding site and that is blocked by soluble heparin, demonstrating that binding to proteoglycans is mediated by their heparan sulfate chains.

The development of the peripheral nervous system is critically dependent on the migration and proliferation of Schwann cells (1Eccleston P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2Anton E.S. Sandrock Jr., A.W. Matthew W.D. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Milner R.

These processes are needed to provide sufficient numbers of glial cells to ensheathe and myelinate peripheral axons. Schwann cell proliferation and migration are regulated by molecular signals derived from peripheral axons as well as the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; NTD, N-terminal domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; P, postnatal day (e.g. P2); ΔHBS, mutated α4(V)-NTD that lacks the heparin binding site. that invests peripheral nerve tracts. A major source of the peripheral nerve ECM is Schwann cells (4Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar). The structure and composition of the ECM are modified during nerve development. These modifications contribute to the modulation of cellular functions that are regulated by ECM contact. During the late embryonic period when Schwann cell migration and proliferation are most active, the ECM consists mainly of a fibrillar matrix component (4Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar). During the transition to axonal ensheathement and myelination, Schwann cell basal laminae appear. Previous studies (5Carey D.J. Todd M.S. Rafferty M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2224-2263Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Bunge R.P. Bunge M.B. Eldridge C.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1986; 9: 305-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that contact with the basal lamina triggers myelination of axons by Schwann cells. A prominent component of the developing nerve ECM is α4 type V collagen (7Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A high level of expression of the α4(V) polypeptide is restricted to only a few tissues, including developing peripheral nerve, suggesting that this collagen chain carries out a unique function (8Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K.

Native α4(V) polypeptides are secreted by Schwann cells as triple helical collagen heterotrimers that also contain the ubiquitously expressed α1(V) and α2(V) collagen chains (8Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K.

The α4(V) collagen polypeptide consists of a large central collagen domain that is flanked by a noncollagenous N-terminal domain (NTD) of 475 amino acids (including a signal peptide of 29 amino acids) and a C-terminal domain of 251 amino acids. The α4(V)-NTD contains a high affinity heparin binding site that is not present in other type V collagen polypeptides (9Erdman R. Stahl R.C. Rothblum K. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. J. Biol.

The collagen domain inhibits axonal outgrowth and Schwann cell migration and blocks the adhesion and migration-promoting activities of other ECM proteins, such as collagen type IV (10Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C.

The α4(V)-NTD, in contrast, promotes axonal outgrowth and Schwann cell migration and is an excellent substrate for Schwann cell adhesion and spreading. These effects of the NTD are dependent on its heparin binding activity and are blocked by soluble heparin or heparan sulfate but not by function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies (9Erdman R. Stahl R.C. Rothblum K. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7619-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Schwann cell interaction with α4(V)-NTD is mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This conclusion is supported by the observation that syndecan-3, a Schwann cell transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, binds in vitro to α4(V)-NTD by a heparan sulfate-dependent mechanism (11Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This study extends these findings and presents data on the processing of the α4(V) collagen chain in Schwann cell cultures and in developing peripheral nerve tissue. The α4(V)-NTD is released constitutively by a proteolytic mechanism that is enhanced by collagen assembly. The released α4(V)-NTD accumulates in Schwann cell cultures and rat peripheral nerve tissue. α4(V)-NTD binds to the Schwann cell plasma membrane and ECM via binding to the heparan sulfate proteoglycans, glypican-1 and perlecan. Schwann Cell Cultures—Schwann cells were isolated from newborn rat sciatic nerves as described previously (12Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 μm forskolin. To investigate the effects of ascorbate on α4(V) collagen, Schwann cells were grown to confluence and then l-ascorbic acid (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Ascorbate was replenished after 24 h. After 48 h, the medium was harvested, centrifuged to remove unattached cells, and stored at –80 °C. Cell extracts were prepared by washing the cells twice with PBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and then scraping them into 300 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer with 2% SDS. Extracts were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of Anti-collagen Type V Antibodies—The preparation of antibodies against the α4(V) collagen chain and α1(V) N-terminal domain was described previously (8Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K.

The recombinant His-tagged α4(V)-NTD was expressed in BL23-pLys-S Escherichia coli cells (Novagen) that were transformed with pET-30a(+) vector containing the NTD coding sequence. The protein was purified by chromatography on His-Bind resin (Novagen) followed by heparin-agarose chromatography (Sigma). The purified protein was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (11Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Antibodies were affinity-purified on a column of α4(V)-NTD coupled to Affi-Gel-15 (Bio-Rad) by elution with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. Expression of Myc-tagged α4(V) Collagen—A Myc epitope tag was inserted into rat α4(V) collagen cDNA (NCBI accession number AF272661) at nucleotide position 1163 by overlapping PCR. PCR was performed using XL DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) with 10 ng of α4(V) collagen cDNA as the template. Amplification conditions were 1 min at 94 °C and 1 or 4 min at 60 °C for 20 cycles. First round PCR products were gel-purified and used as templates in a subsequent PCR assay in which sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers flanked the initiation and stop codons. PCR conditions were as above except that the extension was at 60 °C for 5 min. The resulting products were cloned into pcDNA 3.1-V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Positive clones were sequenced using a Beckman CEQ 2000XL capillary sequencer. Schwann cells in 60-mm dishes (70% confluence) were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA, 8 μl of PLUS reagent, and 12 μl of LipofectAMINE in 2.3 ml of Opti-MEM 1 (Invitrogen). After 3 h, the transfection medium was replaced with 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 μm forskolin. Immunoblot Analysis of Collagen Polypeptides—Aliquots of Schwann cell-conditioned medium were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon) at 70 V for 1.5 h. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) plus 1% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in rabbit anti-Myc antibody (1:1000 dilution) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-α4(V) collagen antibody (1:1500 dilution), rabbit anti-α4(V)-NTD antibody, or rabbit anti-α1(V)-NTD antibody. The membranes were washed three times for 10 min each in blocking buffer and incubated for 30 min with the appropriate horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). The membranes were washed twice for 10 min each in blocking buffer, rinsed in water, and then washed twice for 10 min each in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were developed in SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) and imaged on a Lumi-Imager (Roche Applied Science). Sciatic nerves were homogenized in cold 1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, plus protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 40 μm pepstatin A, 8 μm aprotinin, 5 mm benzamidine, and 120 μm leupeptin). The extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pierce) at 70 V for 1.5 h. The membranes were stained, and chemiluminescent detection was carried out as described above. Immunocytochemistry—Immunostaining of Schwann cells was performed first by rinsing the cells with cold PBS and incubating them on ice with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h. Next, the cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed for 30 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted in blocking buffer for 1.5 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were rinsed with PBS, overlaid with coverslips using MOWIOL mounting solution and imaged using a Leica Microsystems scanning confocal microscope. Sciatic nerves were isolated, embedded in Tissue-Tek freezing medium, and frozen at –20 °C. Cryosections (7 μm thick) were cut using a Reichert-Jung cryostat, placed on glass microscope slides, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. After fixing, sections were rinsed with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Following a rinse with PBS, sections were incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted in blocking buffer for 1.5 h. After a final rinsing with PBS, the sections were overlaid with coverslips using MOWIOL mounting solution and imaged with a Leica Microsystems confocal microscope. SC α4(V)-NTD Binding Assays—Schwann cells were plated in glass slide chambers (Nunc) coated with collagen type IV (2.5 μg/cm2) (BD Biosciences) and cultured for 3 days in Schwann cell growth medium. The cells were then placed on ice, rinsed with PBS, and incubated for 20 min in serum-free medium (50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F-12 medium, 100 μg/ml apotransferrin, 100 ng/ml insulin) plus 1% bovine serum albumin with or without purified recombinant α4(V)-NTD (10 μg/ml). Next, the cells were rinsed with PBS and prepared for immunocytochemistry as described above. To investigate the effect of removing glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, the cells were rinsed with 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and incubated in HEPES buffer with or without PI-PLC (1 unit/ml Prozyme/Glyco) for 20 min at 37 °C. α4(V)-NTD binding was assayed as described above. Pull-down Assays of α4(V)-NTD Binding—Detergent extracts of cultured Schwann cells were clarified by centrifugation, mixed with purified recombinant α4(V)-NTD bound covalently to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma), and rocked gently at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were harvested by a brief centrifugation, and supernatant solutions containing unbound proteins were removed. The beads were rinsed three times with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 m sodium chloride and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Eluted proteins were digested with heparitinase (4.5 milliunits/ml) (Seikagaku) for 18 h at 37 °C and then separated by SDS gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies to a heparan sulfate Neo epitope (3G10) (Seikagaku), perlecan (a gift from Dr. Peter Yurchenko), glypican-1 (13Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Tucker B. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or syndecan-3 (7Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Constitutive Release of α4(V)-NTD in Schwann Cell Cultures—The domain structure of the α4(V) collagen polypeptide is shown in Fig. 1A. We have shown previously (8Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K. Tyler W.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28208-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that the addition of ascorbic acid to Schwann cell cultures stimulates the assembly of α4(V) polypeptides into triple helical collagen molecules that also contain α1(V) polypeptides. As shown in Fig. 2, ascorbic acid also stimulated the release of the NTD from the α4(V) collagen polypeptide. This was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of Schwann cell-conditioned medium from cultures grown without or with ascorbic acid. When the medium from cultures grown in the absence of ascorbic acid was analyzed, antibodies to α4(V) collagen or the α4(V)-NTD revealed a single immunoreactive band of ∼200 kDa. Similar results were obtained when polypeptides from the medium of cultures transfected with α4(V) collagen cDNA containing a Myc epitope tag inserted into the NTD were stained with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 2) (also see Fig. 1 for the location of the Myc epitope tag). Based on immunoreactivity with anti-α4(V)-NTD and anti-Myc antibodies, the 200-kDa polypeptide contained the α4(V)-NTD but not the noncollagenous C-terminal domain (see Fig. 1). The latter conclusion is based on the observation that this polypeptide was not detected by anti-V5 antibodies when medium from cells transfected with α4(V) cDNA containing a V5 epitope tag at the C terminus was analyzed (data not shown). Conditioned medium of Schwann cells incubated with ascorbic acid contained the 200-kDa immunoreactive band plus a more prominent band of ∼95 kDa that was stained by anti-α4(V) and anti-NTD antibodies (Fig. 2). Ascorbic acid produced a slight reduction in mobility of the 200-kDa polypeptide, consistent with increased post-translational modification. An apparently identical Myc-reactive polypeptide of 95 kDa was observed in medium from ascorbate-treated Schwann cells transfected with Myc-tagged α4(V) collagen cDNA. From these results, we conclude that the 95-kDa polypeptide is the intact released α4(V)-NTD. After 48 h of ascorbate treatment, the ratio of released α4(V)-NTD to full-length 200-kDa α4(V) polypeptide in Schwann cell-conditioned medium was ∼10:1. The released α4(V)-NTD was not detected in Schwann cell lysates (data not shown), suggesting that the release occurred after secretion of the α4(V) collagen polypeptide. Together, these results demonstrate that the α4(V)-NTD is released constitutively from type V collagen molecules and that it then accumulates in conditioned medium of cultured Schwann cells. The α4(V)-NTD release is accelerated greatly by ascorbate treatment, which promotes the assembly of collagen type V trimers. Type V collagen molecules secreted by Schwann cells are heterotrimers that contain both α4(V) and α1(V) collagen polypeptides. The α1(V) collagen polypeptide also contains a noncollagenous N-terminal domain that shows a high degree of sequence homology with the N-terminal half of the α4(V)-NTD. As shown in Fig. 2, conditioned medium of Schwann cells cultured without ascorbate contained a 200-kDa polypeptide that was stained with antibodies raised against the α1(V)-NTD. Analysis of the medium from cells cultured with ascorbic acid showed the 200-kDa band plus additional bands of ∼180 kDa and a doublet of ∼45 kDa. The lower molecular mass of the doublet polypeptides was approximately half the size of the released α4(V)-NTD. These results suggest that the α1(V)-NTD contains two protease cleavage sites, the presence of which results in the release of two nonoverlapping NTD fragments. α4(V)-NTD Release in Vivo—α4(V) collagen is expressed by Schwann cells in newborn rat peripheral nerves and at significantly reduced levels in adult nerves (7Chernousov M.A. Scherer S.S. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To investigate the fate of the α4(V) NTD in vivo, rat sciatic nerves were harvested on postnatal day 2 (P2) and at 3 months of age. Nerve extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-α4(V) and anti-α4(V)-NTD antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, extracts of P2 nerves contained the 200-kDa form of α4(V) collagen and a much greater amount of the released α4(V)-NTD. In extracts of nerves from adult animals, the 200-kDa α4(V) collagen form was barely detectable, whereas the released α4(V)-NTD was detectable but present at lower levels than in extracts of P2 nerves. These results demonstrate that α4(V)-NTD is released and then accumulates in peripheral nerves in vivo. The highest levels of α4(V)-NTD are observed in developing nerves. The localization of α4(V)-NTD in peripheral nerve tissue was investigated by confocal microscopy. Fig. 4 shows images of postnatal day 10 sciatic nerve sections stained with anti-α4(V)-NTD, anti-laminin, and anti-neurofilament antibodies. Laminin is a major component of the basal lamina sheets that are apposed closely to the outer Schwann cell membrane (4Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 593-601PubMed Google Scholar). Antilaminin antibodies produced linear staining of the region out-lining the outer Schwann cell membrane, corresponding to the location of the Schwann cell ECM. Anti-α4(V)-NTD antibodies produced discontinuous and slightly more diffuse staining of the same region, suggesting that α4(V)-NTD is localized to the Schwann cell ECM. This was confirmed by dual staining of nerve sections with anti-α4(V)-NTD and anti-laminin antibodies (Fig. 4, C–F). α4(V)-NTD Binding to Schwann Cells—Experiments were carried out to investigate the interaction between α4(V)-NTD and Schwann cells. The addition of soluble α4(V)-NTD to Schwann cells that were incubated in medium without ascorbic acid resulted in α4(V)-NTD binding to the Schwann cell surface, which was visualized readily by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5). The role of the α4(V)-NTD high affinity heparin binding site in binding to Schwann cells was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5, the addition of soluble heparin completely blocked the binding of α4(V)-NTD to Schwann cells. In addition, α4(V)-NTD that was mutated to remove the heparin binding site (ΔHBS) (9Erdman R. Stahl R.C. Rothblum K. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7619-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) failed to bind to Schwann cells. These results suggest that α4(V)-NTD binds via its heparin binding site to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the Schwann cell surface. Ascorbic acid stimulates the assembly in Schwann cell cultures of fibrillar ECM that contains collagen types I, IV, and V and the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan. In ascorbic acid-treated cultures, endogenous α4(V)-NTD was also associated with the fibrillar extracellular matrix (not shown). Exogenous α4(V)-NTD bound to the fibrillar ECM in ascorbate-treated Schwann cell cultures (see below). Together, these results suggest that the α4(V)-NTD binds to both the cell surface and ECM heparan sulfate proteoglycans of Schwann cells. Identification of α4(V)-NTD-binding Proteoglycans in Schwann Cells—Schwann cell proteoglycans that bind to α4(V)-NTD were isolated by pull-down assays using α4(V)-NTD or α4(V)-NTD-ΔHBS immobilized on beads. Schwann cell lysates contained several heparan sulfate proteoglycan species with core proteins ranging in size from ∼50 to >250 kDa, as revealed by heparitinase digestion and staining with an antibody that recognized the heparitinase digestion product on core proteins (Fig. 6). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans that bound to α4(V)-NTD-coated beads were identified by staining heparitinase-digested proteins with anti-heparan sulfate stub antibodies or specific anticore protein antibodies. α4(V)-NTD-bound proteoglycans included perlecan (core protein >250 kDa), a 200-kDa core protein, and glypican-1 (core protein ∼64 kDa) (Fig. 6). Syndecan-3 was not detected in the α4(V)-NTD-bound samples. We believe the 200-kDa protein is a perlecan-derived fragment that does not react with the anti-perlecan antibody. No binding of heparan sulfate proteoglycans to NTD-ΔHBS-conjugated beads was detected (Fig. 6), demonstrating that proteoglycan binding was mediated by the α4(V)-NTD high affinity heparin binding site. Similar results were obtained when extracts of P7 rat sciatic nerve were subjected to α4(V)-NTD pull-down assays (data not shown). Glypican-1 is a lipid-anchored proteoglycan of the plasma membrane, and perlecan is a secreted ECM proteoglycan. To confirm that these proteoglycans are major binding sites for α4(v)-NTD, the localization of bound α4(V)-NTD and these proteoglycans was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Fig. 7, A–C, shows micrographs of cultures that were incubated with soluble α4(V)-NTD and then stained with anti-α4(V)-NTD (green) and anti-glypican-1 (red) antibodies. Both antibodies produced a punctate staining pattern on the Schwann cell surface. Superimposition of α4(V)-NTD and glypican-1 images (Fig. 7C) shows a substantial overlap of the two proteins. To provide additional evidence that α4(V)-NTD bound to glypican-1, the effects of digestion with PI-PLC were investigated. As shown in Fig. 8, incubation with PI-PLC abolished cell surface glypican-1 staining. Incubation with PI-PLC also substantially reduced the binding of soluble α4(V)-NTD. These data also demonstrate that glypican-1 and surface-bound α4(V)-NTD are enriched in the numerous filopodia that extend from the Schwann cell surface.Fig. 8PI-PLC removes glypican-1 and α4(V)-NTD binding sites on Schwann cells. Schwann cells were incubated for 20 min in medium without (-) or with (+) PI-PLC, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The cells were then incubated with recombinant α4(V)-NTD and rinsed and then stained with anti-glypican-1 antibodies or anti-α4(V)-NTD antibodies (green) (left column) and fluorescent phalloidin (red) (middle column). The superimposed images are shown in the right column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 7, D–F, shows micrographs of cultures that were incubated in medium with ascorbate to induce ECM assembly and then incubated with soluble α4(V)-NTD and stained with anti-α4(V)-NTD (red) and anti-perlecan (green) antibodies. Both antibodies stained prominent fibrillar structures that correspond to the Schwann cell ECM. Superimposition of α4(V)-NTD and perlecan images (Fig. 7F) shows a substantial overlap of the two proteins. Together, these data support the conclusion that the major Schwann cell binding sites for α4(V)-NTD are glypican-1 and perlecan. In this study we investigated the processing of the α4(V) collagen chain by Schwann cells. This collagen chain is expressed abundantly by Schwann cells during peripheral nerve development (14Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2763-2777PubMed Google Scholar). An unusual feature of the structure of α4(V) collagen is the presence of a large noncollagenous N-terminal domain that contains a unique high affinity heparin/heparan sulfate binding site (8Chernousov M.A. Rothblum K. Tyler W.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28208-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Erdman R. Stahl R.C. Rothblum K. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7619-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we show that the α4(V)-NTD is released constitutively by Schwann cells both in culture and in vivo and that it accumulates in conditioned culture medium or the endoneurium ECM in vivo. The released α4(V)-NTD binds to the cell surface and to ECM heparan sulfate proteoglycans, especially glypican-1 and perlecan. This binding occurs via a mechanism that requires the high affinity heparin binding site and appears to be mediated by binding of the α4(V)-NTD to heparan sulfate chains. This process is summarized in Fig. 9. The protease responsible for α4(V)-NTD release is not known. The proteolytic cleavage that results in α4(V)-NTD release appears to occur after secretion of the polypeptide because α4(V)-NTD is not detected in Schwann cell lysates. Release is increased dramatically by ascorbate treatment of the cells, which promotes assembly of collagen type V heterotrimers as a result of increased post-translational modification of amino acid residues in the collagen domain. After 48 h of ascorbate treatment, ∼90% of the α4(V) collagen chains that accumulate in Schwann cell medium have undergone α4(V)-NTD release. Several protease inhibitors that have been reported to block proteolytic collagen processing events in other systems (15Unsold C. Pappano W. Imamura Y. Steiglitz B. Greenspan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were tested for their ability to block Schwann cell-mediated α4(V)-NTD release. Furin inhibitor I (10 μm), 1,10-phenanthroline (15 mm), arginine (25 mm), and the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor BB-94 (50 μm) failed to produce demonstrable inhibition (data not shown). Although the protease cleavage site was not identified directly, several observations suggest that the site is located within the second collagen GXX sequence interruption. Expression of α4(V) collagen with a Myc epitope tag near the C-terminal end of the noncollagenous NTD (see Fig. 1) resulted in the accumulation of Myc-tagged α4(V)-NTD in Schwann cell medium. Expression of α4(V) collagen with a Myc epitope tag located between the second and third GXX repeat of the uninterrupted collagen domain (amino acid 369) resulted in the accumulation of Myc-tagged α4(V) collagen domain (data not shown). When the Myc epitope tag was inserted within the second GXX interruption (amino acid 472), the epitope was destroyed. This region contains the sequence AQAQA, which has been suggested as the site for cleavage of the α1(XI) collagen chain (16Rousseau J. Farjanel J. Boutillon M. Hartmann D. van der Rest M. Moradi-Améli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23743-23748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This putative cleavage site sequence is conserved in other members of this collagen gene family, including α1(V) and α4(V) collagen (Fig. 1). It is also of interest that α1(V) and α1(XI) collagens each contain an additional AQAQ motif near the middle of the noncollagenous N-terminal domain that is not present in the α4(V)-NTD (Fig. 1). This could explain the observation that the α4(V)-NTD is released as a single large fragment, whereas the α1(V) NTD is released as two smaller fragments of approximately equal size (Fig. 9). We also investigated the fate of released α4(V)-NTD. In peripheral nerve tissue, anti-α4(V)-NTD immunoreactivity was associated with the region corresponding to the Schwann cell outer membrane and the closely apposed Schwann cell ECM (Fig. 4). The immunostaining reflects primarily the localization of released α4(V)-NTD, because immunoblot analysis of nerve tissue revealed a strong preponderance of released α4(V)-NTD compared with α4(V) collagen chains containing full-length NTD (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that a similar localization is observed for glypican-1 and perlecan in peripheral nerve tissue (12Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Experiments with cultured Schwann cells revealed that soluble α4(V)-NTD binds to the Schwann cell plasma membrane primarily through binding to glypican-1. Evidence for this is provided by the co-localization of bound α4(V)-NTD and cell surface glypican-1, the significant reduction in cell surface α4(V)-NTD binding by pretreatment with PI-PLC, and pull-down assays that demonstrated glypican-1 binding to α4(V)-NTD. α4(V)-NTD binds to heparan sulfate chains on glypican-1, based on the observations that the binding requires the high affinity heparin binding site in α4(V)-NTD and that the binding is blocked by low concentrations of exogenous soluble heparin. α4(V)-NTD also binds to the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan in Schwann cell cultures. The association of α4(V)-NTD with perlecan in the ECM of Schwann cell cultures incubated in medium with ascorbic acid was observed. In the experiments reported here, we failed to detect significant binding of α4(V)-NTD to the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-3. We have shown previously (11Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13844-13853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that α4(V)-NTD binds syndecan-3. It was this observation, in fact, that led to the initial identification and isolation of α4(V) collagen in our laboratory. The explanation for this apparent contradiction lies in the fact that the steady state concentration of cell surface-associated syndecan-3 is very low in Schwann cells. This is a result of constitutive matrix metalloproteinase-mediated shedding of the syndecan-3 extracellular domain from the plasma membrane (17Asundi V. Erdman R. Stahl R. Carey D. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 73: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ability to detect binding of α4(V)-NTD to glypican-1 and perlecan but not syndecan-3 likely reflects the relative steady state levels of these heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the Schwann cell surface and not the inherent specificity of the binding reaction. Immobilized α4(V)-NTD is adhesive for Schwann cells and sensory neurons and is an excellent substrate for Schwann cell and axonal migration (9Erdman R. Stahl R.C. Rothblum K. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7619-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Chernousov M.A. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 21: 6125-6135Google Scholar). In contrast, α4(V)-NTD is a poor substrate for fibroblast adhesion. The adhesive property of α4(V)-NTD for Schwann cells appears to be dependent on heparan sulfate-mediated binding, because adhesion is blocked by soluble heparin and abolished by deletion of the high affinity heparin binding site. The findings reported here suggest strongly that glypican-1 is the primary cell surface α4(V)-NTD-binding protein on Schwann cells. The physiological function of α4(V)-NTD release is not known. A potential function of α4(V)-NTD release may be to terminate the adhesive activity of the molecule by untethering it from the ECM. It is also possible that the α4(V)-NTD possesses additional functional activity of an unknown nature and that heparan sulfate-mediated binding to the Schwann cell surface and nerve ECM provides a mechanism to immobilize the protein. Such immobilization could be used to target α4(V)-NTD to a specific subcellular localization. As revealed by the Schwann cell binding experiments, α4(V)-NTD bound to glypican-1 is enriched in the numerous filopodia that decorate the Schwann cell surface. Alternatively, α4(V)-NTD immobilization could provide a reservoir of protein to be released in response to a specific physiological stimulus. Such a mechanism has been proposed (18Carey D.J. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W1986745001,"An 18-bp enhancer controls cell-specific expression of the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide gene. The enhancer is bound by a heterodimer of the bHLH-Zip protein USF-1 and -2 and a cell-specific factor from thyroid C cell lines. In this report we have identified the cell-specific factor as the forkhead protein Foxa2 (previously HNF-3β). Binding of Foxa2 to the 18-bp enhancer was demonstrated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The cell-specific DNA-protein complex was selectively competed by a series of Foxa2 DNA binding sites, and the addition of Foxa2 antiserum supershifted the complex. Likewise, a complex similar to that seen with extracts from thyroid C cell lines was generated using an extract from heterologous cells expressing recombinant Foxa2. Interestingly, overexpression of Foxa2 activated the 18-bp enhancer in heterologous cells but only in the presence of the adjacent helix-loop-helix motif. Likewise, coexpression of USF proteins with Foxa2 yielded greater activation than by Foxa2 alone. Unexpectedly, Foxa2 overexpression repressed activity in the CA77 thyroid C cell line, suggesting that Foxa2 may interact with additional cofactors. The stimulatory role of Foxa2 at the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide gene enhancer was confirmed by short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Foxa2. As seen with Foxa2 overexpression, the effect of Foxa2 knockdown also required the adjacent helix-loop-helix motif. These results provide the first evidence for combinatorial control of gene expression by bHLH-Zip and forkhead proteins.

The calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CT 1The abbreviations used are: CT, calcitonin; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; HLH, helix-loop-helix; siRNA, short interfering RNA; TK, thymidine kinase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: CT, calcitonin; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; HLH, helix-loop-helix; siRNA, short interfering RNA; TK, thymidine kinase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GFP, green fluorescent protein./CGRP) gene expresses the hormone CT in thyroid C cells and the neuropeptide CGRP in neurons. CT is a therapeutically useful modulator of bone metabolism and calcium homeostasis (1Copp D.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1007-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but it may also play additional roles based on the recent unexpected finding of increased bone mass in CT/CGRP and CT receptor knock-out mice (2Zaidi M.

CGRP is an alternative splicing product from the CT/CGRP gene (5Rosenfeld M.G. Mermod J.J. Amara S.G. Swanson L.W. Sawchenko P.E. Rivier J. Vale W.W. Evans R.M.

Regulation of CGRP expression in response to extracellular stimuli is controlled exclusively at the transcriptional level. Studies on both the human and rat CT/CGRP gene have identified a cell-specific enhancer containing helix-loop-helix (HLH) motifs ∼1 kb upstream of the transcription start site (15Stolarsky-Fredman L.

We have shown that an 18-bp element with a single HLH site and a flanking octamer-like motif is both sufficient and necessary for cell-specific enhancer activity (18Tverberg L.A. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15965-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol.

Using nuclear extracts prepared from the neuronal-like CA77 thyroid C cell line, bHLH-Zip proteins USF-1 and -2 were shown to bind the enhancer in vitro (19Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although Oct1 can bind the A/T-rich half of the flanking site, Oct1 cannot transactivate the enhancer (18Tverberg L.A. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15965-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, a cell-specific protein referred to as OB2 was shown to bind an adjacent 8-bp site that partially overlaps the HLH site (19Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). OB2 was identified as an ∼68-kDa protein by UV-cross-linking and is present in human and rat thyroid C cell lines but not in cell lines that do not express the CT/CGRP gene (19Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study have shown that OB2 is the forkhead protein Foxa2, formerly called HNF-3β. We demonstrate that Foxa2 is able to bind and activate the CT/CGRP enhancer in heterologous cells. Importantly, this transactivation requires the adjacent HLH site and is increased upon co-expression of USF. The combinatorial role of Foxa2 and USF was further demonstrated by short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Foxa2 levels, which reduced enhancer activity but only in the presence of the HLH site. These results demonstrate that Foxa2 and USF cooperate to regulate CT/CGRP gene expression in thyroid C cells. Cell Culture and Transfections—The CA77 thyroid C cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose)/Ham's F-12 (1:1), 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) at 37 °C in 7% CO2. Other cell lines were maintained in 5% CO2; HeLa, Ham's F12, 10% fetal bovine serum; COS-7, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum; NCI-H460, RPMI 1640, 10% bovine calf serum. Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) were added to all growth media, except for the NCI-H460 medium. The rat CT/CGRP promoter and herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) promoter luciferase plasmids and the empty expression vector CMV-5 have been described previously (18Tverberg L.A. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15965-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol.

The HLH mutation plasmid has the enhancer sequence 5′CAGcggatccgCTGTGCAAT3′ (BamHI linker in lowercase), which contains a disrupted HLH motif with a reconstituted OB2 site. The CMV-Foxa2 (HNF-3β) expression vector containing the full-length rat cDNA (1.6-kb EcoRI fragment) and two truncated Foxa2 plasmids expressed from the cytomegalovirus promoter and artificial ATGs were kindly provided by R. Costa, University of Illinois. Both include the winged helix DNA binding domain but are transcriptionally inactive. They begin with amino acids 122 and 153. The Foxa2 isoform-3 plasmid was generated by PCR from CMV-Foxa2 plasmid DNA using primers with EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. The upstream primer was 5′-CGGAATTCTACTCTTCCGTGAGCAAC-3′, and the downstream primer was 5′-CGCGGATCCGGACGAGTTCATAATAG-3′. The PCR product was gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (–)/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen), and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The human USF-1 (pN3) and mouse USF-2 (pN4) in the pSG5 expression vector were originally provided by Dr. M. Sawadogo (University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center). CA77 and COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (19Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Approximately 1–2 × 106 cells were transfected with 5–10 μg of luciferase reporter DNA and 0.5–10 μg of expression vectors. The transfected cells from a single cuvette were grown on a 60-mm dish for 16–24 h. For all experiments, the amount of DNA transfected into the cells was kept constant by the addition of CMV-5 or pcDNA3.1 empty vector DNA. In later experiments, including all of the siRNA experiments, the CA77 cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (22Durham P.L. Russo A.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1570-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). NCI-H460 cells were transfected by electroporation essentially as described (21Coulson J.M. Edgson J.L. Marshall-Jones Z.V. Mulgrew R. Quinn J.P. Woll P.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The conditions were 0.8 ml of cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) in a 0.4-cm cuvette with 10 μg of luciferase reporter DNA and 13 μg of each expression vector DNA using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at 260V, 1050 μF. Immediately after electroporation, 0.4 ml of cells were pipetted into medium in a 10-cm dish and cultured for 20–24 h prior to harvest. All cells were harvested using 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase activity using reagents from Promega. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad). Each experimental condition was repeated in at least three independent experiments in duplicate unless otherwise noted. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test (paired samples). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the CT/CGRP 18-bp enhancer as a probe were performed as described (19Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The probe was prepared by annealing 10 pmol of complementary oligonucleotides with overhanging BamHI ends (lowercase) (5′-gatccGGCAGCTGTGCAAATCCTg-3′, 5′-gatccAGGATTTGCACAGCTGCCg-3′) and labeled with [32P]dATP using Klenow polymerase. All oligonucleotides used as competitors were either blunt-ended or had BamHI ends that were Klenow-filled. The binding reactions contained 0.02 pmol of labeled probe (50,000 cpm), 3 μg of nuclear extract, binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 0.1 μg poly(dI·dC), and 0.1 pmol of an unrelated double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCACTATGTCTAGAG-3′) that eliminated a nonspecific complex. Competitor DNAs and peptides were preincubated for 10 min on ice with nuclear extract before the addition of probe. Antibodies were incubated for 10–15 min after the addition of probe. The rabbit antisera against the N terminus of rat HNF-3α (amino acids 7–103) and HNF-3β (amino acids 7–86) used for EMSA were kindly provided by R. Costa. All other antibodies were rabbit polyclonal IgG obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All reactions were incubated for 10 min on ice before the addition of 4 μlof 20% Ficoll dyes or 3 μl of 50% glycerol dyes, and then resolved by electrophoresis through a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (1:29 bis/acrylamide) and exposed to film overnight. siRNA Duplexes—DNA target sequences were derived from rat Foxa2 cDNA downstream of the start codon and submitted to Qiagen for synthesis of four siRNA duplexes. For the target sequence 5′-CGGGCGCCATGGCGGGCATGA-3′, the duplex Fox-si1 was synthesized as 5′-r(GGCGCCAUGGCGGGCAUGAUU)-3′ and 5′r(UCAUGCCCGCCAUGGCGCCCG)-3′. For the target sequence 5′-GCCGCGCTCGGGACCCCAAGA-3′, Fox-si2 was synthesized as 5′-r(CGCGCUCGGGACCCCAAGAUU)-3′ and 5′-r(UCUUGGGGUCCCGAGCGCGGC)-3′. For the target sequence 5′-TGCGCCGCCAGAAGCGCTTCA-3′, Fox-si3 was synthesized as 5′-r(CGCCGCCAGAAGCGCUUCAUU)-3′ and 5′-r(UGAAGCGCUUCUGGCGGCGCA)-3′. For the target sequence 5′-TCCCCCCATTCCAGCGCTTCT)-3′, Fox-si4 was synthesized as 5′-r(CCCCCAUUCCAGCGCUUCUUU)-3′ and 5′-r(AGAAGCGCUGGAAUGGGGGGA)-3′. A control (non-silencing) siRNA conjugated to rhodamine fluorescent dye was also obtained from Qiagen. The sense 5′-r(UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU)d(TT)-3′ and antisense 5′-r(ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA)d(TT)-3′ sequences were used for the target sequence 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′ with a 5′-rhodamine (TAMRA) modification for the sense strand. All four synthesized siRNAs include two-nucleotide 3′ overhangs to assist target recognition. The ribonucleotides of the four duplexes and the 2′-deoxythymidine overhangs of the control siRNA provide a degree of nuclease resistance inside the transfected cells (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8012) Google Scholar). Transfection of siRNA—CA77 cells were grown to 50–90% confluency and then trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in fresh medium without antibiotics. Approximately 225,000 cells in 1 ml were added to each well of a 12-well plate (Falcon). For each well, a solution containing 0.14 μg of siRNA and 0.28 μg of reporter plasmid DNA (ratio 1:2) was added to Eppendorf tubes containing 50 μl of prewarmed Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). In tubes without control or Fox siRNA, the empty plasmid CMV5 was included. LipofectAMINE 2000 (1 μl of a 1 mg/ml stock) was added to additional tubes containing 50 μl of Opti-MEM I for 5 min. The transfection reagent and siRNA were mixed and incubated 20 min. siRNA/DNA-LipofectAMINE 2000 complexes (100 μl) were added to the wells dropwise (before the cells had adhered). For the lower dosages of Foxa2 siRNA, 0.02 μg of siRNA was combined with 0.12 μg of non-silencing siRNA and 0.28 μg of reporter plasmid DNA (ratio 1:2). The control samples always contained the equivalent amount (0.14 μg) of the non-silencing siRNA. Each condition was conducted in duplicate or triplicate. Fresh medium was added 24–48 h after transfection. Approximately 72 h after transfection, cells were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and scraped, and lysates were prepared in 50 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) with a single round of freeze-thawing to aid lysis. Protein was determined by the Bradford method. For cell sorting, the transfections were scaled up to 12 wells for each sample. Cell sorting was carried out ∼72 h after transfection using a BD Biosciences fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) DiVA. Cells were removed by trypsinization, pooled, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 1 ml of medium at about 106 cells/ml. Each cell suspension was filtered through 70-μm mesh filters (Falcon 2350) to remove foreign particles, and transferred to 12 × 75 mm tubes (Falcon 2052) on ice. GFP-positive cells were sorted into tubes containing 5 ml of medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in PBS, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and spun down in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. Lysates were prepared by resuspending the cells in 100 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and freezing samples at –20 °C. Western Blots—Equal amounts of cell lysate (3–8 μg in different experiments) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE for 1 h at 30 mA. The Precision Plus Protein (Bio-Rad) ladder was used as size standards. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) overnight at 4 °C at 30V. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 5-min wash in PBST. Primary antibody was a 1:1000 dilution of sheep anti-HNF3β IgG (Upstate Biotechnology) in PBST, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% sodium azide, which was incubated either for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed in PBST for 15 min and then incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. After extensive washing with PBST, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were placed back in 5% milk in PBST and then probed using an antibody that recognizes α-tubulin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signal intensities were estimated by densitometry of multiple exposed films using NIH Image 1.63 software. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pulldown—Full-length Foxa2 was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX-6P2 (Amersham Biosciences). The TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to make [35S]Met-labeled USF-1, USF-2, and PITX2a proteins. The labeled proteins were made in a total volume of 50 μl with 3 μl of [35S]methionine for 30 °C for 90 min as recommended by the manufacturer. 20 μl of labeled proteins were incubated with 50 μl of GST-coated or GST-Foxa2-coated beads in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm dithiothreitol, 300 ng/ml ethidium bromide for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 750 μl of binding buffer (minus the ethidium bromide) six times on ice; this was followed by two washes with 750 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The beads were heated at 95 °C, and the bound proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to autoradiographic film. Identification of Foxa2 as OB2—The cell-specific CT/CGRP 18-bp enhancer contains overlapping binding sites for a USF-1 and -2 heterodimer and a cell-specific protein that we have referred to previously as OB2 (Fig. 1A). The OB2 binding site has been defined previously as an 8-bp element that overlaps the HLH motif by 2-bp (19Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It should be noted that upon competition of OB2, unidentified complexes near USF and Oct-1 were often (but not always) observed. The identification of OB2 came about by serendipity when we used a liver nuclear extract as a “negative control” for EMSAs. Unexpectedly, a complex was observed that had the same binding properties in EMSAs as the OB2 complex from the CA77 thyroid C cells (data not shown). A survey of known liver transcription factors and their binding sites revealed the forkhead protein Foxa2 as a likely candidate. Foxa2 has approximately the same size (47 kDa) as predicted from the 68-kDa OB2 protein that we had identified previously by UV-cross-linking from CA77 cells (19Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The difference in size could be caused by the cross-linked DNA. We tested several known Foxa2 sites, and all were found to compete for OB2 in the EMSA (Fig. 1B). In contrast, oligonucleotides containing similar sites recognized by C/EBP and other factors were not able to compete for OB2. Likewise, mutation of the OB2 site to create palindromic versions of the site did not compete for binding. The most effective competitor was HNF3 #4 (24Overdier D.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). As little as a 5-fold molar excess of this Foxa2 binding element was able to specifically compete with the 18-bp enhancer for binding to the OB2 complex (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Identification of OB2 as forkhead protein Foxa2. Antisera against Foxa2 (a2) and Foxa1 (a1) (HNF-3α) were used in an EMSA with CA77 nuclear extract and 18-bp enhancer probe. The Foxa2 antiserum supershift (ss) complex and OB2 are indicated by an open arrow and black arrow, respectively. The left panel is an EMSA under low stringency conditions. A 1-, 5-, and 10-fold molar excess of a Foxa2 binding site (HNF3 #4 oligonucleotide) was used to compete the OB2 complex. A nonspecific (non-sp) complex seen below OB2 is indicated. The right panel is an EMSA with a 5-fold molar excess of a random oligonucleotide that eliminates the nonspecific complex. The free probe was cropped from both panels. Con, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To prove that Foxa2 bound the CT/CGRP enhancer we used a Foxa2 antiserum. Addition of Foxa2 antiserum eliminated the OB2 complex and yielded a supershifted complex (Fig. 2). To reduce the chance that another complex might be missed that comigrated with Foxa2, the supershift was done under both low (Fig. 2, left panel) and high (Fig. 2, right panel) stringency conditions. Under low stringency conditions, a non-specific complex was seen below OB2 and was removed by competition with all oligos, including a random linker DNA. As controls, OB2 was not shifted by antisera against HNF-3α (Fig. 2) or eight other factors (C/EBP-α, C/EBP-β, Ets-1, Ets-2, c-Rel, SRF, Elk1, Hmx3) (data not shown). To confirm that Foxa2 can bind the 18-bp enhancer, we used the heterologous COS-7 cells. These cells do not express Foxa2 protein based on Western blots (data not shown). An OB2 complex was detected using nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with a Foxa2 expression vector (Fig. 3). As a control, EMSAs with nuclear extracts prepared from untransfected COS-7 cells did not yield an OB2 complex. The complex seen with extracts from the Foxa2 complexes comigrated with the OB2 complex from CA77 nuclear extracts and was specifically competed by an oligonucleotide containing a Foxa2 binding site (Fig. 3). Thus, by competition, supershift, and expression binding studies, OB2 is the forkhead protein Foxa2. Foxa2 Overexpression Activates the 18-bp Enhancer in Heterologous Cells—Having demonstrated that Foxa2 binds the enhancer, we then asked if expression of Foxa2, along with USF-1 and -2, was sufficient for enhancer activity. We used the heterologous COS-7 cell line, which as mentioned above does not contain endogenous Foxa2 but does contain USF-1 and -2. The COS-7 cells do not have 18-bp enhancer activity as seen by the comparable activity of the reporter genes that contain the TK promoter and the TK promoter with the multimerized 18-bp enhancer (Fig. 4). Likewise, mutation of the HLH site of the 18-bp enhancer within the context of the 1.25-kb CT/CGRP promoter (1.25-CT/CGRP Bam mutant) had no effect on reporter activity in the COS-7 cells. Co-transfection of a Foxa2 expression vector increased activity of the 18-bp enhancer 2-fold (Fig. 4). Although small, this increase was specific for the 18-bp enhancer because Foxa2 did not activate the parental TK promoter reporter. This activation is consistent with the detection of Foxa2 binding activity following transfection of COS-7 with a Foxa2 expression vector in Fig. 3. Interestingly, Foxa2 was able to activate the 1.25-kb CT/CGRP promoter but not the 1.25-kb CT/CGRP Bam mutant promoter with the mutated HLH site in the 18-bp enhancer (Fig. 4). This implicates coordinate action of Foxa2 with HLH proteins at the enhancer because the Foxa2 binding site is not directly affected by this mutation. Similar results were seen in HeLa cells (data not shown). This is consistent with our previous findings that both the HLH and OB2 motifs are required for enhancer activity (18Tverberg L.A. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15965-15973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicates that Foxa2 activity requires the adjacent HLH motif. To further explore the dependence of Foxa2 upon the HLH site, we cotransfected both Foxa2 and USF expression vectors into NCI-H460 cells. This non-small cell lung cancer line was chosen because it expresses relatively low levels of USF-1 and -2 proteins, and overexpression of USF in this cell type has been shown previously to strongly activate the arginine vasopressin promoter (21Coulson J.M. Edgson J.L. Marshall-Jones Z.V. Mulgrew R. Quinn J.P. Woll P.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The need for a cell line with low USF levels was driven by our finding that overexpression of USF-1 and -2, with or without Foxa2, had little or no effect on enhancer activity in COS-7 cells (data not shown). One possible explanation for the lack of activation by overexpressed USF proteins is that these proteins are already present in COS-7 cells. NCI-H460 cells do not have Foxa2 protein that is detectable on Western blots, and reporter genes have similar activities with or without the 18-bp enhancer (data not shown). Thus, the NCI-H460 cells have low levels of USF and do not have intrinsic 18-bp enhancer activity. Transfection of USF expression vectors activated the 1.25-kb CT/CGRP promoter in NCI-H460 cells (Fig. 5A). Overexpression of USF-2 consistently yielded greater activation than USF-1 alone, but the greatest activation was seen with the combination of USF-1 and USF-2. This agrees with our previous report that the enhancer is predominantly bound by a USF-1 and -2 heterodimer (19Lanigan T.M. Russo A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18316-18324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cells were then transfected with the Foxa2 expression vector. Expression of Foxa2 yielded 3–4-fold activation of CT/CGRP promoter activity (Fig. 5B). When we coexpressed USF-1 and USF-2 with Foxa2, there was a significantly greater (7-fold) activation of the CT/CGRP promoter (Fig. 5C). As a control, the cells were also transfected with a Foxa2 isoform that lacks the first 30 amino acids (isoform 3) (Fig. 5, B and C). Isoform 3 was previously reported to be unable to activate the glucagon promoter (25Philippe J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 368-374PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated Foxa2 did not activate the CT/CGRP promoter, and the observed decrease in promoter activity suggests that isoform 3 may be acting as a dominant negative protein. In addition, coexpression of USF-1 and USF-2 did not restore transcriptional activ"

Mutations in the human GCS1 gene give rise to the congenital disorder of glycosylation termed CDG IIb. Lec23 mutant cells have been shown to alter lectin binding and to synthesize predominantly oligomannosyl N-glycans on endogenous glycoproteins. A single point mutation (TCC to TTC; Ser to Phe) was identified in Lec23 Gcs1 cDNA and genomic DNA. Serine at the analogous position is highly conserved in all GCS1 gene homologues. A human GCS1 cDNA reverted the Lec23 phenotype, whereas GCS1 cDNA carrying the lec23 mutation (S440F in human) did not. By contrast, GCS1 cDNA with an R486T or F652L CDG IIb mutation gave substantial rescue of the Lec23 phenotype. Nevertheless, in vitro assays of each enzyme gave no detectable α-glucosidase I activity. Clearly the R486T and F652L GCS1 mutations are only mildly debilitating in an intact cell, whereas the S440F mutation largely inactivates α-glucosidase I both in vitro and in vivo. However, the S440F α-glucosidase I may have a small amount of α-glucosidase I activity in vivo based on the low levels of complex N-glycans in Lec23. A sensitive test for complex N-glycans showed the presence of polysialic acid on the neural cell adhesion molecule.

There are a growing number of human diseases that arise from altered glycosylation of glycoproteins or lipid-linked oligosaccharides and are termed congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) 1The abbreviations used are: CDG, congenital disorders of glycosylation; N-CAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Con A, concanavalin A; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; L-PHA, leukoagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris; PSA, polysialic acid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; FACS, fluorescence-activated cytometry; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F.1The abbreviations used are: CDG, congenital disorders of glycosylation; N-CAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Con A, concanavalin A; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; L-PHA, leukoagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris; PSA, polysialic acid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; FACS, fluorescence-activated cytometry; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F.

In addition, there are a number of myopathies due to defective O-glycan synthesis on α-dystroglycan (3Martin P.T. Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 67R-75RCrossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Endo T. Toda T. Biol. Pharm.

Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 57R-68RCrossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As disease mutations are identified, it becomes important to characterize the altered biochemical properties of mutant genes and to investigate ways in which enzyme activity may be modulated. Such studies are best performed in a cell that is null for the activity under investigation. Cells that lack a glycosylation enzyme activity may be derived from a particular patient or a mutant mouse or mutant cells selected in culture. The latter are most desirable because fibroblasts isolated from humans or mice often have a finite lifetime, are not easy to grow, or are difficult to transfect. By contrast, cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are well characterized, are easy to culture and transfect, and have many characterized glycosylation mutants (6Stanley P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 525-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this paper we describe the molecular basis of the Lec23 CHO mutant and show that it is an excellent host for characterizing mutations in α-glucosidase I that give rise to the human congenital disorder of glycosylation CDG IIb. Lec23 cells were obtained following a single step selection for lectin resistance from a mutagenized population of CHO cells (9Stanley P. Sallustio S. Krag S.S. Dunn B. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1990; 16: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cells are highly resistant to the leukoagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris (L-PHA) and to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and are hypersensitive to concanavalin A (Con A). Complementation analysis showed that the lec23 mutation is recessive, and biochemical analysis revealed defective α-glucosidase I activity (10Ray M.K. Yang J. Sundaram S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22818-22825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Glucosidase I initiates the processing of N-glycans by removing the distal α(1,2)Glc residue from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2Asn in the endoplasmic reticulum (11Shailubhai K.

The G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus obtained from Lec23 mutant cells has predominantly oligomannosyl N-glycans with three terminal glucoses (10Ray M.K. Yang J. Sundaram S. Stanley P. J.

Lec23 cells have been used to study endoplasmic reticulum chaperones, such as calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57, that recognize monoglucosylated oligomannosyl N-glycans and aid in the folding of glycoproteins (13Hammond C.

Thus it was important to determine the molecular basis of the mutation in Lec23 cells that might be in the Gcs1 gene that encodes α-glucosidase I or in a regulatory gene. In either case, Lec23 cells would be useful in understanding mutations that give rise to an α-glucosidase I deficiency and CDG IIb (23De Praeter C.M. Gerwig G.J. Bause E. Nuytinck L.K.

To transfect expression constructs, cells were cultured on a 24-well plate for 1 day to ∼90% confluency, washed once with Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen), and incubated in 0.5 ml Opti-MEM I medium containing 3% fetal calf serum. Plasmid DNA (2 μg) and LipofectAMINE 2000 from Invitrogen (2 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of Opti-MEM I in separate tubes. After 5 min at room temperature, plasmid DNA and LipofectAMINE 2000 were mixed, incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and added to cells. After 12–24 h at 37 °C, cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA and cultured in α minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfectants were analyzed 48–72 h post-transfection. Lectin Toxicity Assay—Cells (2,000/well of a 96-well dish) were incubated with increasing concentrations of Con A, WGA, or L-PHA in complete medium for 3–4 days at 37 °C. Cells that remained attached were stained using methylene blue, and the concentration of lectin that killed 90% of the cells was determined. Flow Cytometric Analysis—To compare CHO and Lec23 cells for lectin binding, 106 cells were incubated with FITC-WGA (Vector, 25 μg/ml), FITC-L-PHA (Vector, 10 μg/ml), FITC-Con A (Vector, 10 μg/ml), or FITC-ricin (Vector, 1 μg/ml) in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS on ice for 15 min.

After washing once with 4 volumes of 1% BSA/PBS, cells were analyzed on a FACscan instrument (BD Biosciences). Stained cells were gated based on size. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry—Glycoproteins were extracted from parent and Lec23 CHO cells in 1.5% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and 500 μg of protein was treated with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (New England Biolabs) as described (28von Der Ohe M.

Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Released N-glycans were methylated under conditions that specifically methylated sialic acid residues only so they could be detected in the positive ion mode (29Powell A.K. Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Subsequent sample purification was by ion exchange chromatography as described (29Powell A.K. Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager DE Biospectrometry work station (Perseptive Biosystem) equipped with delayed extraction. Oligosaccharide standards of known structure were used for external calibration for mass assignment of ions, and d-arabinosazone (30Chen P. Baker A.G. Novotny M.V. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was used as the matrix in the positive ion mode for the analysis of neutral oligosaccharides. α-Glucosidase I and β4-Galactosyltransferase 1 Assays—Parent and Lec23 CHO cell extracts prepared in 1.5% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) were assayed for α-glucosidase I activity using [3H]Glc3Man9GlcNAc2Asn as substrate as described previously (10Ray M.K.

Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (30 μg) was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and separated in a 1% agarose-denaturing gel. After transfer to a Hybond N+ membrane, a 1.5-kb probe was PCR-amplified from pCR-CHO-GCS1(3′) plasmid using CHO-GCS2F (5′-atggccggaagtcctactaccagaag-3′) and CHO-GCS4R (5′-aggggctccagagatggcggctgtc-3′) primers and purified from a 1% agarose gel. The PCR products were radiolabeled using the Random-It priming kit (Stratagene). The membrane was incubated in prehybridization solution (0.05 m PIPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m NaPO4 (pH 7.0), 10 mm EDTA, 5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) at 60 °C for 2 h before adding the probe, and the incubation was continued at 60 °C overnight. Washing was performed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and twice in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS before exposure to x-ray film for 2 days at –80 °C. For stripping, the membrane was soaked in boiled 0.5% SDS in diethyl pyrocarbonatetreated water, cooled to room temperature, and stored at –20 °C before probing with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe to determine relative loading and RNA integrity. Cloning of CHO Gcs1 cDNA—To clone Chinese hamster Gcs1, subpools of 5,000 cDNA clones were made from a CHO-K1 cell library in pSPORT (a gift from Drs. Osamu Kuge and Masahiro Nishijima, Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) and screened by PCR with primers PS673 (5′-gctggagagtgaccgtagagcctcagg-3′, forward) and PS674 (5′-gaaaggggctttcagtgtcacctgctg-3′, reverse), which were designed from mouse and rat Gcs1-coding sequences. PCR was performed at 94 °C (30 s), 58 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min) for 35 cycles using platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). From a subpool showing positive bands by PCR, a 5′ fragment of hamster Gcs1 was amplified with an upstream vector primer and PS674. The longest fragment, which covered a putative second exon of the Gcs1 gene, was purified from a 1% agarose gel and sequenced. A 3′ fragment was amplified with PS673 and downstream vector primer, sequenced, and found to contain poly(A) signals. This fragment of 2.1 kb was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and named pCR-CHO-Gcs1(3′). Construction of a Human GCS1 cDNA—IMAGE clone 3637073, which contains an alternatively spliced human GCS1 cDNA at the 3′ end, was purchased from the IMAGE Consortium. To construct a functional GCS1 cDNA, the 3′ region was amplified using hGCS1F (5′-agtggctctggccgtcgtggtcctgtc-3′) and hGCS1R(XbaI) (5′-gggccctctagagccagagtggcatgagtgtcttggctc-3′) primers and subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). A 0.35-kb EcoRI-KpnI fragment from IMAGE 3637073 and a 2.3-kb KpnI-XbaI fragment cloned in pCR2.1 were ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) that had been digested with EcoRI and XbaI and named pcDNA3.1(+)-hGCS1. To construct tagged hGCS1, the GCS1 coding region was amplified by PCR using hGCS3F(SalI) (5′-agtgccgtcgacgctcggggcgagcggcggcgc-3′) and hGCS1R(XbaI) primers from pcDNA3.1(+)-hGCS1. This fragment was cut at SalI and XbaI sites, cloned into pME-3FLAG (32Hong Y. Ohishi K. Inoue N. Kang J.Y. Shime H. Horiguchi Y. van der Goot F.G. Sugimoto N. Kinoshita T.

After mutagenesis, all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Western Blot Analysis—Lec23 cells (1.5 × 106) were incubated in a 6-well plate in complete medium for 12 h. Cells were washed once with Opti-MEM I, and Opti-MEM I with 3% fetal calf serum was added. pME-3FLAG-hGCS1 or hGCS1 mutant cDNA (10 μg/well) and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 were mixed with 250 μl of Opti-MEM I, respectively. After 5 min at room temperature, diluted plasmids and LipofectAMINE 2000 were mixed together. After 20 min, DNA liposomes were added to cells and cultured for 1 day in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were detached using trypsin/EDTA and cultured in complete medium for 1 day. To detect FLAG-tagged GCS1, cells (5 × 106) were dissolved in 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) for 1 h. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated beads (Sigma) for 1 h. After washing three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 in TNE buffer, proteins were released from beads by boiling in sample buffer, separated in 7.5% acrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blot analysis was performed with biotinylated anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1/2000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Pierce) (1/5000) as described (33Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R.

To detect complex N-glycans on N-CAM, cells (1 × 107) were extracted in 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40 in TNE. Supernatants obtained after 1 h of incubation on ice and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min were immunoprecipitated with anti-PSA mAb 735 and protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences). After adding sample buffer and boiling, proteins were separated on a 6% acrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. N-glycans were detected with biotinylated L-PHA (10 μg/ml) (Vector) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (1/2000). PSA modified N-CAM was detected on the same membrane after incubation in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 55 °C for 30 min followed by washing in 5 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 1% Nonidet P-40. PSA on N-CAM was detected with anti-PSA mAb 735 and sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase. Glycosidase Treatments and Western Blot Analysis—Cell pellets from 2 × 106 cells were extracted in 100 μl of 5 mm Tris (pH 8.0) with 1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice. Enzyme treatment was per the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Briefly, after centrifugation to remove nuclei, 16 μl of cell extract and 2 μl of bovine pancreas RNase B (10 μg) were mixed with 2 μlof10× glycoprotein denaturation buffer and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. After cooling, 2 μl of 10× G7 buffer and 2 μl of PNGase F or distilled water, or 2 μlof10× G5 buffer and 2 μl of Endo H or distilled water, were added to cell extracts. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, reactions were stopped by adding 44 μlof4% SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated with anti-N-CAM antibodies followed by sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase. Bound antibodies were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit and exposure to x-ray film. To detect PSA-modified N-CAM proteins, the same membrane was incubated in stripping buffer for 30 min at 55 °C and washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween. PSA on proteins was detected with anti-PSA mAb 735 followed by sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase. Lec23 Mutants Are Readily Differentiated from CHO Cells by Lectin Binding—Lec23 cells were previously distinguished from CHO cells by a lectin resistance cytotoxicity test as shown in Fig. 1A (9Stanley P. Sallustio S. Krag S.S. Dunn B. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1990; 16: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). They are highly resistant to L-PHA and WGA, lectins that bind to complex N-glycans, and are hypersensitive to Con A, a lectin that binds best to oligomannosyl N-glycans (34Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11235-11240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether resistance to lectins reflects a reduction in lectin binding and hypersensitivity reflects increased lectin binding, Lec23 and CHO cells were examined by fluorescence-activated cytometry (FACS) using fluorescence-tagged lectins (Fig. 1B). Compared with parental CHO cells, Lec23 mutants showed much less binding of L-PHA and WGA and more binding of Con A. The reduction in L-PHA binding was ∼6-fold greater than the reduction in WGA binding, consistent with differences observed with the lectin resistance assay. Lec23 cells also bound less ricin than parent CHO, as expected if complex N-glycans are reduced (Fig. 1B). Endogenous Lec23 Glycoproteins Carry Oligomannosyl N-glycans Terminating with Three Glc Residues—Previous studies using 1H NMR spectroscopy showed that vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein produced from infected Lec23 cells carried predominantly oligomannosyl N-glycans terminating in three Glc residues with Glc3Man7GlcNAc2 being the major species (10Ray M.K. Yang J. Sundaram S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22818-22825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, vesicular stomatitis virus G from parent CHO cells carries only complex N-glycans at both N-glycosylation sites (35Stanley P. Vivona G. Atkinson P.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 36Campbell C. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13370-13378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the proportion of N-glycans that are affected by the lec23 mutation, Lec23 cell glycoprotein extracts were treated with PNGase F to release all N-glycans or with Endo H to release oligomannosyl and hybrid N-glycans, and the mildly methylated N-glycans were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode. The conditions of methylation were such that only sialic acid residues should be methylated, thereby rendering them detectable in the positive ion mode (29Powell A.K. Harvey D.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It can be seen in Fig. 2A and Table I that the N-glycans released from Lec23 glycoproteins by PNGase F were predominantly oligomannosyl. Glc3Man7GlcNAc2 was the major species, and there were no sialylated species. There were small amounts of biantennary species and truncated triantennary species as well as Man8GlcNAc2 lacking Glc. Therefore the mutant α-glucosidase I in Lec23 cells must have a small amount of activity, or these N-glycans reflect the existence of an alternative processing pathway. The major N-glycan released by Endo H was Glc3Man7GlcNAc1 (Fig. 2B and Table I), and there were minor species lacking Glc, which indicates a small amount of α-glucosidase I activity in Lec23 or an alternative pathway. Although Man8GlcNAc1 lacking Glc might theoretically arise from the action of a Golgi endomannosidase (37Lubas W.A. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3775-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is no evidence that CHO or Lec23 cells have endomannosidase activity (20Spiro M.J. Spiro R.G.

https://openalex.org/W2162549992,"Kar3 is a minus-end-directed microtubule motor that is implicated in meiotic and mitotic spindle function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To date, the only truncated protein of Kar3 that has been reported to promote unidirectional movement in vitro is GSTKar3. This motor contains an NH2-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag followed by the Kar3 sequence that is predicted to form an extended α-helical coiled-coil. The α-helical domain leads into the neck linker and COOH-terminal motor domain. Kar3 does not homodimerize with itself but forms a heterodimer with either Cik1 or Vik1, both of which are non-motor polypeptides. We evaluated the microtubule-GSTKar3 complex in comparison to the microtubule-Kar3 motor domain complex to determine the distinctive mechanistic features required for GSTKar3 motility. Our results indicate that ATP binding was significantly faster for GSTKar3 than that observed previously for the Kar3 motor domain. In addition, microtubule-activated ADP release resulted in an intermediate that bound ADP weakly in contrast to the Kar3 motor domain, suggesting that after ADP release, the microtubule-GSTKar3 motor binds ATP in preference to ADP. The kinetics also showed that GST-Kar3 readily detached from the microtubule rather than remaining bound for multiple ATP turnovers. These results indicate that the extended α-helical domain NH2-terminal to the catalytic core provides the structural transitions in response to the ATPase cycle that are critical for motility and that dimerization is not specifically required. This study provides the foundation to define the mechanistic contributions of Cik1 and Vik1 for Kar3 force generation and function in vivo.

Kar3 is one of six kinesin-related proteins found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Meluh P.B.

It is essential for nuclear fusion during mating (karyogamy) and meiosis I, but Kar3 also has specific mitotic functions during vegetative growth (1Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 1029-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 4Bascom-Slack C.A. Dawson D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Like Drosophila Ncd, Kar3 is classified as a KinC kinesin (Kinesin-14), because the motor domain is at the carboxyl terminus, and it promotes minus-end-directed microtubule motility (5Endow S.A. Kang S.J. Satterwhite L.L. Rose M.D. Skeen V.P. Salmon E.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Middleton K. Carbon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7212-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, Kar3 possesses microtubule-depolymerizing activity (5Endow S.A. Kang S.J. Satterwhite L.L. Rose M.D. Skeen V.P. Salmon E.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The Kar3 amino-terminal globular domain contains a second microtubule-binding site, followed by a central α-helical domain of ∼300 amino acids (7Barrett J.G. Manning B.D. Snyder M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2373-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Kar3 interacts with either Cik1 or Vik1 forming a stable parallel coiled-coil (7Barrett J.G. Manning B.D. Snyder M. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These non-motor polypeptides only show 24% sequence identity, but each has a centrally located α-helical domain of ∼300 amino acids that results in dimerization with Kar3 (7Barrett J.G. Manning B.D. Snyder M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2373-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This unique heterodimeric structure suggests that Kar3Cik1 and Kar3Vik1 cross-link and slide microtubules relative to each other for their in vivo functions (3Manning B.D. Snyder M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 281-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fluorescence imaging and genetic studies have implicated Kar3 in multiple microtubule functions during the life cycle of budding yeast (2Hildebrandt E.R. Hoyt M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Manning B.D. Snyder M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 281-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These diverse functions are modulated in part by Cik1 and Vik1 for cytoplasmic or nuclear localization because the nuclear envelope remains intact during conjugation, meiosis, and mitosis. In response to mating pheromone, budding yeast initiate polarized cell growth to form a rounded mating projection or “shmoo” tip. In these cells, Cik1 appears to target Kar3 to cytoplasmic or astral microtubules (7Barrett J.G. Manning B.D. Snyder M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2373-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Page B. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1414-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Page B.D. Satterwhite L.L.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1219-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Kar3 and Cik1 are interdependent for their localization to the astral microtubules and spindle pole body, and mating cells that lack either Kar3 or Cik1, fail to interdigitate their microtubules and pull their nuclei together after cell fusion (1Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 1029-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Page B. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1414-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Page B.D.

Bloom K. Curr.

These studies have localized Kar3 at both the microtubule plus-ends as well as at the minus-ends that are at the spindle pole body (9Page B.D. Satterwhite L.L. Rose M.D. Snyder M. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cik1 requires Kar3 for its mitotic spindle localization, and cik1 deletion mutants like kar3 mutants have spindle-assembly defects including enhanced cytoplasmic microtubules and very short mitotic spindles (1Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 1029-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Page B. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1414-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Page B.D.

In contrast, Vik1 is not present in pheromone-treated mating cells, and Vik1 is dependent upon Kar3 for its nuclear localization in vegetatively growing cells because it lacks the nuclear localization signal present in both Kar3 and Cik1 proteins (10Manning B.D. Barrett J.G. Wallace J.A. Granok H. Snyder M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1219-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In vegetative cells, vik1 deletion mutants exhibit normal spindles. However, Vik1 appears to target Kar3 to the spindle pole body, where microtubule minus-ends are located. In vik1 deletion mutants, Kar3 accumulates on the mitotic spindle microtubules, yet in vik1-cik1 double deletion mutants, Kar3 localizes diffusely throughout the nucleus (10Manning B.D. Barrett J.G. Wallace J.A. Granok H. Snyder M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1219-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, Kar3Vik1 is thought to antagonize the function of Cin8 and Kip1, both of which are plus-end-directed microtubule kinesins, and thereby maintain the bipolar mitotic spindle through a balance of forces (10Manning B.D.

Although Kar3, Cik1, and Vik1 are present throughout meiosis, Cik1 and Vik1 have different meiotic roles and are not functionally redundant despite their secondary structure similarity (4Bascom-Slack C.A.

Bascom-Slack C. Dawson D.S. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 363-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kar3 functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm. There is evidence for Kar3 localization at the minus-end of microtubules at the spindle poles, and Kar3 localization at the plus-end of shmoo tip microtubules during microtubule depolymerization. In addition, there are obvious roles for microtubule cross-linking and minus-end-directed microtubule sliding of one microtubule relative to another. Although Cik1 and Vik1 are thought to be involved in targeting Kar3 spatially and temporally, this hypothesis has not been explored by in vitro experiments to evaluate an alternative hypothesis that Cik1 and Vik1 also modulate Kar3 mechanochemistry. In addition, we do not understand mechanistically how Kar3 can promote both microtubule sliding and microtubule shortening because microtubule sliding requires microtubule lattice binding by Kar3, whereas microtubule shortening requires Kar3 binding at the microtubule end(s). To begin to understand the mechanistic basis of Kar3 motor activity for its varying functions in vivo, we need a better understanding of Kar3 mechanochemistry independent of Cik1 or Vik1. For our studies, we have chosen the truncated Kar3 motor, GSTKar3, 1The abbreviations used are: GSTKar3, KAR3 gene construct containing His277–Lys729 with an amino-terminal GST tag; GST, gluathione S-transferase; Kar3MD, Kar3 motor domain containing Met383–Lys729; Mt·K, microtubule·GSTKar3 complex; mant, 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl); AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. because it promotes both ATP-dependent microtubule gliding and microtubule depolymerization (5Endow S.A.

This protein contains an NH2-terminal GST tag followed by the Kar3 sequence, which is predicted to form an extended α-helix followed by the neck linker and the COOH-terminal motor domain (Fig. 1A, inset). Our mechanistic analysis of GSTKar3 provides insight into the modular design of the kinesin polypeptides because we can now distinguish functional contributions because of structural elements outside of the catalytic core as compared with cooperative interactions that are provided by dimerization. We compared GSTKar3 to the minimal catalytic core motors of Kar3 (Kar3MD), monomeric Ncd (MC6), monomeric conventional kinesin (K341), and monomeric Eg5 (Eg5–367) and to the well characterized dimers of kinesin (K401) and Ncd (MC1) (23Foster K.A.

Our results show that GSTKar3, like dimeric Ncd and dimeric kinesin, releases ADP upon microtubule association, and the motor domain returns to a conformation that is more likely to bind ATP rather than rebind ADP. In contrast, the catalytic core monomers (Kar3MD, Ncd MC6, kinesin K341, and Eg5–367) release ADP upon microtubule binding but readily rebind ADP (24Mackey A.T. Gilbert S.P.

These results imply that the characteristic of a more open active site with ADP rebinding does not result because of being monomeric. In addition, ATP did promote detachment of GSTKar3 from the Mt·GSTKar3 complex with kinetics more similar to those of dimeric Ncd. The GSTKar3 motor did not appear to remain bound to the microtubule for multiple ATP turnovers, a hallmark characteristic of catalytic core monomers where ATP turnover is uncoupled from force generation and motility. The results presented here, evaluated in the context of the kinetics for Kar3MD, Ncd, kinesin, and Eg5, indicate that the additional sequence outside of the catalytic core is critical for the complete conformational change of the motor head in response to nucleotide at the active site during the cyclic interactions with the microtubule. Protein Purification—The GSTKar3 construct was expressed from bacterial strain MR2754, and the clone was generously provided by Dr. Mark Rose, Princeton University (5Endow S.A. Kang S.J. Satterwhite L.L. Rose M.D. Skeen V.P. Salmon E.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The expressed protein has an NH2-terminal GST tag followed by Kar3 sequence containing His277–Lys729. The GSTKar3 protein was purified as described with slight modifications (5Endow S.A. Kang S.J. Satterwhite L.L. Rose M.D. Skeen V.P. Salmon E.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Comparative experiments were performed with the conserved Kar3 motor domain, designated here as Kar3MD. This construct, pMW/Kar3, encodes residues 383–729 of Kar3, and the clone was generously provided by Dr. Sharyn Endow, Duke University (35Song H. Endow S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11203-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Leu383 was changed to Met383 during the plasmid construction. The protein was purified as described (35Song H. Endow S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11203-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Gulick A.M. Song H. Endow S.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Microtubules were assembled from soluble tubulin (cold depolymerized and clarified) and stabilized with 20 μm Taxol. GSTKar3 has been reported to have a microtubule-destabilizing activity at low Taxol concentrations (5Endow S.A. Kang S.J. Satterwhite L.L. Rose M.D. Skeen V.P. Salmon E.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, at the conditions of the experiments reported here (20 μm Taxol), there was no evidence of GSTKar3 ATP-dependent formation of soluble tubulin based on SDS-PAGE analysis of Mt·GSTKar3 reactions after centrifugation (data not shown). Buffer Conditions—The kinetic and equilibrium binding experiments were performed at 25 °C in ATPase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with potassium hydroxide, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% sucrose). Steady-state ATPase Kinetics—The rate of ATP turnover was measured by following the hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP·Pi as described previously (37Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods (Orlando). 2000; 22: 337-354Google Scholar). The rate of ATP turnover as a function of microtubule concentration (Fig. 1B) was fit to the quadratic equation, Rate=0.5·kcat·{(E0+K1/2,Mt+Mt0)−[(E0+K1/2,Mt+Mt0)2−(4E0Mt0)]1/2} (Eq. 1) where Rate is the amount of product formed per second per active site, kcat is the maximum rate constant of steady-state ATP turnover, E0 is the enzyme concentration, K1/2,Mt is the steady-state Michaelis constant, and Mt0 is the microtubule concentration (μm tubulin). Microtubule Equilibrium Binding Experiments—GSTKar3 at 2 μm was incubated with microtubules (0–12 μm) in the absence of any added nucleotide for 30 min, and centrifuged to obtain a supernatant and pellet as described (37Gilbert S.P. Mackey A.T. Methods (Orlando). 2000; 22: 337-354Google Scholar). The pellet samples were resuspended in ATPase buffer, resulting in supernatant and pellet samples of equal volume. The samples were treated with 5× Laemmli sample buffer and electrophoresed on an 8% acrylamide, 2 m urea, SDS gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and analyzed using NIH Image version 1.62 to determine the concentration of GSTKar3 in the supernatant and pellet at each microtubule concentration. Fractional binding, defined as the ratio of sedimented GSTKar3 to total GSTKar3, is presented in Fig. 1B, inset, as a function of microtubule concentration. The data were fit to the quadratic equation, Mt·E/E0=0.5·((E0+Kd+Mt0)−[(E0+Kd+Mt0)2−4(E0Mt0)]1/2) (Eq. 2) where Mt·E/E0 is the fraction of GSTKar3 sedimenting with the microtubule pellet, E0 is total GSTKar3 concentration, Mt0 is the total tubulin concentration as microtubules, and Kd is the dissociation constant. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted on Kar3MD at 45,000 rpm and 235 nm, and on GST-Kar3 at 34,000 rpm and 280 nm in a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an An60Ti rotor. These experiments were performed in ATPase buffer at 24.7 °C. Solution density (1.01959 gm/ml) and viscosity (1.0666 centipoise) were measured as described (38Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Velocity data were analyzed by Sedfit (version 1.88 (39Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar)) to produce c(s) plots. C(s) analysis on non-interacting systems is more sensitive to low levels of aggregated species. Quantitative analysis of the data was performed by Sedanal (40Stafford W. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) direct boundary fitting to determine the best model, which in this case was a non-interacting two species model (A + B, ideal). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments on GSTKar3 were conducted in ATPase buffer with 50 μm MgADP at 3.6 °C and 15,000 rpm in charcoal-filled Epon 6 channel centerpieces using a short column technique (65-μl samples in 6-channel centerpieces (41Johnson M.L.

Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 231-252Google Scholar)). Equilibrium data were collected at a spacing of 0.001 cm with 9 averages in a step scan mode at 280 nm. Data sets were edited with REEDIT to extract each channel of data and fit jointly by NONLIN (41Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys.J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) to a single species model as described (38Correia J.J. Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4898-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Experiments—The pre-steady-state kinetics of mant-ATP binding, mantADP binding, mantADP release, GSTKar3 binding to microtubules, and detachment of GSTKar3 from microtubules were measured using a KinTek Stopped-Flow instrument (Kintek Corp., Austin, TX) at 25 °C in ATPase buffer. The preparation, purification, and characterization of the N-methylanraniloyl adenosine nucleotides used in this study were described previously (31Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For the experiments with these analogs, the fluorescence emission was measured at 450 nm using a 400-nm cutoff long wave pass filter with excitation at 360 nm (Hg arc lamp). The mantATP binding data in Fig. 3B were fit to the following equation, kobs=k+1[mantATP]+koff (Eq. 3) where kobs is the rate constant obtained from the initial exponential phase of the fluorescence enhancement, k+1 defines the second-order rate constant for mantATP binding, and koff corresponds to the observed rate constant of mantATP dissociation, as determined by the y intercept. The ATP-promoted dissociation kinetics of the Mt·GSTKar3 complex were determined by the change in turbidity monitored at 340 nm. Acid Quench Experiments—The pre-steady-state kinetic experiments to determine the rate constant for ATP hydrolysis were performed with a rapid chemical quench-flow instrument (Kintek Corp.) at 25 °C in ATPase buffer. GSTKar3 (or Kar3MD) and Taxol-stabilized microtubules were preincubated for 30 min to form the Mt·motor complex and then reacted with [α-32P]ATP for times ranging from 5 ms to 5 s. The reaction was then quenched with 5 m formic acid, expelled from the instrument, and aliquots of each reaction were spotted on thin layer chromatography plates and developed to separate radiolabeled ADP + Pi from ATP. The time course of ATP hydrolysis was determined by the acid quench experiments where the acid-labile products ADP and Pi are formed at the active site of the enzyme during the first turnover. The data were fit to the burst equation, Product=A·[1−exp(−kbt)]+ksst (Eq. 4) where A is the amplitude of the burst, which represents the formation of [α-32P]ADP·Pi on the active site during the first turnover; kb is the rate constant of the exponential burst phase; t is time in seconds; and kss is the rate constant of the linear phase (μm product s-1) and corresponds to steady-state turnover. ADP Equilibrium Binding Experiments—These experiments were designed to determine the relative affinity of ADP for GSTKar3 when the motor was bound to the microtubule. GSTKar3 at 2 μm was incubated with trace amounts of Mg-[α-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature. During this incubation, all radiolabeled ATP was converted to [α-32P]ADP·Pi (data not shown). MgADP (0.1–100 μm) plus microtubules (10 μm tubulin + 20 μm Taxol) were added to the motor, which would result in formation of Mt·GSTKar3·[α-32P]ADP intermediate if [α-32P]ADP were tightly bound to active site at these conditions. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min (Beckman Airfuge). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 110 μl of 4 n NaOH, followed by addition of 110 μl of ATPase buffer to obtain supernatant and pellet samples of equal volume. The pellets were not rinsed with additional ATPase buffer. Aliquots of the reaction mixture, the supernatant, and the pellet were evaluated by liquid scintillation counting. Control reactions at each ADP concentration were performed with microtubules + [α-32P]ATP in the absence of GSTKar3 to correct for radiolabeled nucleotide that partitioned with the microtubules nonspecifically. Multiple aliquots of 5 μl were used to determine total counts for the calculation of ADP concentration. The data were plotted and fit to the quadratic equation, Mt·E·ADP=0.5·{(E0+Kd+ADP)−[(E0+Kd+ADP)2−4(E0ADP)]1/2} (Eq. 5) where Mt·E·ADP is the concentration of ADP bound to Mt·GSTKar3 complex, E0 is the total GSTKar3 concentration, ADP is the total nucleotide present, and Kd is the dissociation constant for ADP. Kar3 and Ncd are both characterized members of the KinC subfamily of the kinesin superfamily. Both promote minus-end-directed motility, but only Kar3 has been shown to depolymerize microtubules (5Endow S.A. Kang S.J. Satterwh"
https://openalex.org/W1982292577,"The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), which activates transcription from the wild-type lacP1 promoter and most of its mutants, represses productive RNA synthesis from a lacP1 promoter variant that contains an extended -10 element, although CRP enhances RNA polymerase binding as well as open complex formation in both promoters. Moreover, abortive RNA synthesis, which is already higher in the extended -10 variant compared with the parent promoter, was further enhanced by CRP. These results, together with the observed decrease in productive RNA synthesis, indicate that CRP, while facilitating the earlier steps of initiation, inhibits transcription from the extended -10 lacP1 by hindering promoter clearance. We propose that CRP decreases energetic barriers to RNA polymerase binding, isomerization, and abortive RNA synthesis but stabilizes the abortive RNA initiating complex, which results in increasing the activation energy of the transition state before the elongation complex. The results demonstrate for the first time that a DNA-binding regulatory protein acts as an activator or a repressor in different steps of the transcription initiation pathway because of the energetic differences of the intermediate complex in the same promoter.

The results demonstrate for the first time that a DNA-binding regulatory protein acts as an activator or a repressor in different steps of the transcription initiation pathway because of the energetic differences of the intermediate complex in the same promoter. The premier step of gene regulation occurs at the level of transcription in which a gene regulatory DNA-binding protein acts as an activator or a repressor causing enhancement or inhibition of the transcription initiation process, respectively. Activators could act by helping the binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; CRP, cyclic AMP receptor protein; αCTD, the carboxyl terminal domain of the α subunit; ΔαCTD, the α1–235 mutant RNAP. or other associated factors at the promoter and/or by influencing a post-binding step, such as isomerization or promoter clearance. On the other hand, repressors could sterically hinder the binding of RNAP or other essential transcription factors to the promoter and/or influence one or more post-binding steps of the initiation process. Although classified as activators or repressors of transcription, some of these regulatory proteins have been found to be bifunctional, acting as an activator at one promoter and as a repressor at another (1Ptashne M.

We described previously a lacP1 promoter mutant that showed a very high level of transcription in the absence of CRP (26Liu M. Tolstorukov M. ZhurKin V. Garges S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Here we report that in an extended -10 sequence-containing derivative of this CRP-independent lacP1 promoter, the regulator bound to the original -61.5 activation site acts as a repressor. CRP enhances RNAP binding and isomerization as well as abortive RNA synthesis but decreases full-length RNA transcription from the extended -10 promoter. Proteins and DNA—RNAP was purified from E. coli K-12 cells (MG1655) as described (27Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol.

All promoters were tested for function by runoff transcription of PCR-amplified fragments as templates. The templates were 390-bp long, which contained 314 bp upstream of the transcription start point (+1) of lacP1 and 76 bp downstream of +1. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C and the runoff transcripts were analyzed through an 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. For abortive transcripts assays, samples were analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. The transcripts were quantified with a Amersham Biosciences ImageQuant™ Storm™ imaging system; the data for each species were corrected for background. Electrophoresis Mobility Assays—Electrophoresis mobility assays were carried out as described (26Liu M. Tolstorukov M. ZhurKin V. Garges S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heparin, when added, was at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Reaction mixtures were loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis at room temperature with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer and 0.2 mm cAMP in the top reservoir and 1× Tris borate-EDTA in the bottom. KMnO4 Footprinting—The experiments followed a modification of a protocol described previously (15Liu M. Gupte G. Roy S. Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. Garges S. J. Biol.

DNA (10 nm 390-bp PCR-amplified fragments) and RNAP (30 nm) were incubated with or without 50 nm CRP and 0.1 mm cAMP in 1× transcription buffer with 5% glycerol and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C before KMnO4 (12.5 mm) was added. The reactions were quenched by 2-mercaptoethanol. The primers were extended using a PCR cycle to amplify signals. The products were electrophoresed in an 8% polyacrylamide and 7 m urea sequencing gel. CRP-independent lac Promoter Variants Are Further Stimulated by the Activator—The E. coil lacP1 promoter is intrinsically weak because of its non-consensus -35 and -10 elements and 18-bp spacer length. Mutations that strengthen RNAP binding or isomerization make the promoter CRP-independent. For example, the CRP-independent lacP1 mutants, lacPs and lacPUV5, have base pair changes that make the -10 region consensus or near consensus (32Reznikoff W.S. Abelson J.N. Miller J.H. Reznikoff W.S. The Operon. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978: 221-243Google Scholar). We isolated previously a lacP1 promoter variant (lacP1-6) in which an 8-bp GC-rich sequence (-20CCGGCTCG-13) was replaced by an AT-rich sequence (TTTATGTT) in the “spacer” region between the -35 and -10 elements. lacP1-6 showed extraordinary promoter activity and, like lacPs and lacPUV5, CRP independence (26Liu M. Tolstorukov M. ZhurKin V. Garges S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6911-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All of these CRP-independent lac variants were -35 element-dependent, and their transcription was further stimulated by CRP (26Liu M. Tolstorukov M. ZhurKin V. Garges S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6911-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Reznikoff W.S. Abelson J.N. Miller J.H. Reznikoff W.S. The Operon. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978: 221-243Google Scholar). A CRP-independent lac Mutant Is Repressed by CRP—When the CRP-independent lacP1-6 was changed to become -35 element-independent by converting it to an extended -10 element-containing promoter, lacP1-6S1, it remained highly active without CRP and a -35 element (Fig. 1A, lane 13 and Fig. 1B, lane 3). However, it showed significant reduction of transcription in the presence of CRP (Fig. 1A, lanes 13–18). Interestingly, CRP repression at the promoter was dependent upon the presence of the -35 element; mutation of the -35 element abolished CRP repression at the promoter. If anything, CRP increased transcription in the latter template (Fig. 1B, lane 4). In addition, we found the -10 and extended -10 elements were also important in lacP1-6S1. The promoter activity was reduced by the single base pair substitutions at the -10 and extended -10 elements, and CRP repression was switched back to activation by the mutations (Table II).Table IIThe effect of single base-pair substitutions at the extended -10 motif and -10 element on promoter activity and CRP regulationPromoterslacP1–6S1-15T → G-14G → T-12T → G-11A → TTranscription-CRP10060507020Percentage (%)aThe amount of the transcripts was normalized to the percentage of that of lacP1–6S1 in the absence of CRP, which was taken as 100%.

Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 25Benoff B. Yang H. Lawson C.L. Parkinson G. Liu J. Blatter E. Ebright Y.W. Berman H.M. Ebright R.H. Science. 2002; 297: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, when using wild-type RNAP, the full-length transcripts from the CRP-independent lacP1-6 promoter were enhanced by CRP, and those from lacP1-6S1 were reduced by CRP (lanes 1–4). However, when using a αCTD deletion mutant RNAP (α1–235), CRP neither activated lacP1-6 nor repressed lacP1-6S1 (lanes 5–8), suggesting that CRP-αCTD interaction is also needed for CRP repression at lacP1-6S1. We also noted that the intrinsic promoter activity of lacP1-6 was stronger than that of lacP1-6S1 when wild-type RNAP was used; however, the opposite was true when ΔαCTD RNAP transcribed the templates, suggesting that αCTD supports the lacP1-6 activity but inhibits lacP1-6S1 activity even in the absence of the regulator. Although αCTD is not absolutely required for transcription initiation at promoters lacking an UP element, it contributes to transcription initiation, which is independent of its ability to form a specific protein-DNA contact (33Burns H.D. Ishihama A. Minchin S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2051-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). CRP Enhances RNAP Binding lacP1-6S1—We used electrophoretic mobility assays to determine the strength of RNAP binding to the promoters and observed that lacP1-6S1 had a higher affinity (∼30% higher) for RNAP compared with the parental lacP1-6 promoter at equilibrium (Fig. 2A and Table III), although the latter was stronger as judged by RNA synthesis (Fig. 1A, lane 7 versus lane 13). However, CRP also stimulated the binding of RNAP to both lacP1-6S1 (∼1.4-fold) and lacP1-6 (∼1.8-fold) (Fig. 2B and Table III). Interestingly, the lacP1-6 mutant with a defective -35 element, lacP1-6M(-35), formed at least three types of weak complexes with RNAP (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–8), most of which were not observed if the binding reactions were terminated by heparin before loading onto the gel (Fig. 2E, lanes 1–8). These complexes are likely different forms of closed complexes formed at the promoter. On the other hand, lacP1-6S1M(-35), with a defective -35 element, formed the same type of complex as with lacP1-6S1 (Fig. 2, panel C, lanes 9–16 versus panel A, lanes 9–16). These complexes were unaffected by adding heparin (Fig. 2E, lanes 9–16). CRP stimulated the binding of RNAP to both of the -35 mutant templates (∼3-fold at lacP1-6M(-35) and 1.4-fold at lacP1-6S1M(-35)) and changed the pattern of bands at lacP1-6M(-35) (Fig. 2D and Table III). Under these conditions, CRP made the DNA· RNAP·CRP ternary complexes the major species observed on a gel, the other species being reduced at lacP1-6M(-35) (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–9). Unlike at lacP1-6S1M(-35) (lanes 10–18), the DNA· RNAP binary open complex, which migrates close to the DNA·RNAP·CRP, was not observed at lacP1-6M(-35) even with excess RNAP, suggesting that the DNA·RNAP binary open complex could not form at the promoter without CRP. However, except for dissociation of the DNA·CRP complex, heparin appeared not to alter the pattern of bands in the other three promoters (lacP1-6, lacP1-6S1, and lacP1-6S1M(-35)), suggesting that the complexes detected in these three are mostly open complexes (Fig. 2F, lanes 10–18) (26Liu M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sullivan J.J. Bjornson K.P. Sowers L.C. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8005-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The salt reacts preferentially with pyrimidines when they are distorted in the DNA duplex. KMnO4 footprinting provides direct information as to the location and degree of the DNA distortions in the open complex. The results of KMnO4 probing of the different promoters in the absence and presence of CRP are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, the wild-type lacP1 DNA was distorted weakly at positions +1, -11, and -12, whereas the lacP2 DNA was strongly distorted at its -10, -11, and -12 positions (corresponding to -31, -32, and -33 of lacP1) in the absence of CRP. In the presence of the regulator, the distortion at position -11 of lacP1 was significantly enhanced, but the corresponding distortion at lacP2 was inhibited (Fig. 3, lanes 5–7). At lacP1-6, no distortion of lacP2 was detected in the absence or presence of CRP; DNA was distorted with polymerase alone at position -11, which represents the lacP1 locus; the presence of CRP slightly stimulated DNA distortion at this site (Fig. 3, lanes 8–10). At lacP1-6M(-35), formation of open complex was very weak in the absence of CRP, which is consistent with the electrophoresis mobility assay data of this template, but was stimulated in the presence of the regulatory protein (Fig. 3, lanes 11–13). Formation of open complex was very strong at the extended -10 promoters lacP1-6S1 and lacP1-6S1M(-35) in the absence of CRP; slight increases were observed in the presence of CRP (Fig. 3, lanes 14–16 and lanes 17–19, respectively). Quantification of the band at -11 by a PhosphorImager showed that the formation of an open complex was stimulated ∼3.3-fold at lacP1-wt, 2.5-fold at lacP1-6M(-35), 50% at lacP1-6, 16% at lacP1-6S1M(-35), and 12% at lacP1-6S1. In contrast to lacP1-wt, lacP1-6, and lacP1-6M(-35), the following distinguishable modifications were observed at lacP1-6S1 and lacP1-6S1M(-35). (i) Distortion at -15T was unique at the extended -10 promoters, suggesting that the extended -10 motif T-15G-14 at the non-template strand might be specifically distorted when interacting with region 3.0 of the σ70 subunit (35Barne K.A. Bown J.A. Busby S.J. Minchin S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4034-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). (ii) Compared with lacP1-6S1, a weaker distortion occurred at +1T, but a stronger one occurred at +13T in lacP1-6S1M(-35). It appears that RNAP has expansive DNA contacts in the downstream region at the extended -10 promoter when the -35 element was defective. (iii) More importantly, the formation of an open complex at the two extended -10 promoters were much stronger than that at lacP1-6, although the latter is a stronger promoter as judged by RNA synthesis (26Liu M. Tolstorukov M. ZhurKin V. Garges S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6911-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The KMnO4 experiments suggest that the extended -10 promoters are quite different from lacP1-wt and lacP1-6 in a DNA distortion profile quantitatively and even qualitatively. CRP Stimulates Abortive RNA Synthesis—To figure out why the strong binding of RNAP and more open complex formation at the extended -10 promoters results in less amounts of productive RNA synthesis in lacP1-6S1 in the presence of CRP, the transcription products of the promoters were analyzed for abortive RNA synthesis on a 20% gel with 7 m urea. As shown in Fig. 4, 3-mer and 5-mer as well as significant amounts of 4-mer abortive RNA were synthesized from lacP1-6S1 compared with that from lacP1-6 (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3). CRP further stimulated the abortive RNA synthesis in both (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 4). However, mutation of the -35 element in lacP1-6S1 dramatically reduced the abortive RNA synthesis (Fig. 4, lane 7), although CRP restored this synthesis again to the higher level (Fig. 4, lane 8). We noted that very little abortive transcripts were synthesized from lacP1-6M(-35) either in the absence or presence of CRP (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). When using the ΔαCTD mutant RNAP, abortive RNA synthesis was not detected in lacP1-6 and was made in somewhat reduced amounts in lacP1-6S1 either in the absence or presence of CRP (Fig. 4, lanes 9–12). Overall, the amount of abortive RNA synthesis in the presence of CRP is highest in lacP1-6S1. The composition of the abortive RNA in lacP1-6S1 was somewhat different as well. Several regulators are known to have dual roles acting at different levels. First, the regulator facilitates binding of RNAP to one promoter but hinders the access of RNAP to another, sometimes overlapping or divergent promoter. Specific examples are as follows: (i) CRP acting as an activator at lacP1 and galP1and as a repressor at lacP2 and gaP2 (18Musso R.E. Di Lauro R. Adhya S. de Crombrugghe B.

Nes I.F. Skaugen M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); and (iii) the bacteriophage Φ29 p4 protein acting as an activator at the phage promoter A3 and as a repressor at the promoter A2b (37Rojo F. Salas M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3429-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Nuez B. Rojo F. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11401-11405Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Second, the regulator stimulates or inhibits transcription by stimulating or disabling RNAP activity at a post-RNAP binding step. By contacting αCTD to an unfavorable or a favorable state, GalR (and LacI in the case of a hybrid gal-lac promoter) stimulates open complex formation at galP2 and inhibits isomerization at galP1, mediated through αCTD (2Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Choy H.E. Park S.W. Aki T. Parrack P. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Adhya S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Φ29 p4 protein also traps the initiating complex at the phage A2C promoter by contacting with αCTD, leading to repression of promoter clearance by RNAP (5Monsalve M. Mencia M. Rojo F. Salas M.

The bacteriophage 434 cI protein activates transcription from the PRM promoter by contacting the σ or/and the α subunit of RNAP and represses the adjacent but divergent PR promoter by preventing transition of a closed to an open complex (39Xu J. Koudelka G.B. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 40Xu J. Koudelka G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 573-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The intrinsically defective lacP1 promoter requires CRP for activation of transcription both in vitro and in vivo (32Reznikoff W.S. Abelson J.N. Miller J.H. Reznikoff W.S. The Operon. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978: 221-243Google Scholar). Several lacP1 mutants, lacPs, lacP uv5, and lacP1-6, have been reported that are active in the absence of CRP but are also further stimulated by the regulatory protein (26Liu M. Tolstorukov M. ZhurKin V. Garges S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6911-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Reznikoff W.S. Abelson J.N. Miller J.H. Reznikoff W.S. The Operon. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978: 221-243Google Scholar). However, as described above, another variant, lacP1-6S1, which contains an extended -10 element, was repressed by CRP. The repression was -35 element-dependent; mutation of the -35 element abolished CRP-mediated repression. In addition, the -10 and extended -10 elements are important for lacP1-6S1; single base pair substitutions at the two elements decreased the promoter activity and made the promoter regain CRP activation. It is known that interaction between the C-terminal domain of the α subunit of RNAP, αCTD, and CRP is the sole basis of activation at lacP1 (10Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 25Benoff B. Yang H. Lawson C.L. Parkinson G. Liu J. Blatter E. Ebright Y.W. Berman H.M. Ebright R.H. Science. 2002; 297: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). An αCTD-deleted mutant RNAP abolished not only the enhancement of transcription from the parental lacP1-6 promoter but also CRP-mediated repression of transcription at lacP1-6S1, suggesting that an CRP-αCTD interaction is also the basis of repression at lacP1-6S1. Detailed biochemical analysis of the steps of transcription initiation at lacP1-6 and lacP1-6S1 described above showed that CRP increased the binding of RNAP, enhanced formation of an open complex, and made large amounts of abortive RNA synthesis. The accumulation of abortive RNA in the presence of CRP suggested that CRP provides a barrier to promoter clearance in both promoters. Our results also showed that the contact(s) between CRP and αCTD of RNAP is obligatory to the stimulatory or inhibitory effect of CRP at different steps of transcription in both lacP1-6 and lacP1-6S1. Moreover, lacP1-6S1 has four potential target sites (the -35 element, the -15 element, the extended -10 motif, and the -10 element), which is one more than lacP1-6 (the -35, -15, and -10 elements) has, for RNAP contact. The CRP-αCTD contact may further increase the strength of one or more of the RNAP-promoter contacts. We hypothesize that by stabilizing the corresponding transition states, the CRP-αCTD interaction(s) decreases the energetic barrier to closed, open, and initiating complex formation and helps increased RNAP binding, open complex formation, and abortive RNA synthesis. In this model, the (R.P)i intermediate is more stable in lacP1-6S1, thereby increasing the activation energy of promoter clearance. The net effect is in reduced frequency of transition from the initiating to the elongating complex and decreased full-length RNA synthesis. This differential CRP action at lacP1-6S1 is illustrated in the energy diagram (Fig. 5) (8Roy S. Garges S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14059-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this connection, we note that CRP has been proposed to stimulate the promoter clearance step at another promoter, PmalT, by differentially stabilizing the appropriate intermediates of initiation (41Eichenberger P. Dethiollaz S. Buc H. Geiselmann J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9022-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). By these criteria, CRP, a paradigm of activator of transcription, becomes bifunctional; it activates and represses different steps of the initiation pathway. More interestingly, CRP, bound at the same DNA site, acts either as an activator or as a repressor at different steps of transcription initiation, depending on the energy differentials of the steps of initiation at the same promoter. It was demonstrated previously that intrinsic promoter strength is determined by various rate-limiting steps of the overall process. The efficiency of each step is determined by a given DNA sequence element of the promoter (42Deuschle U. Kammerer W. Gentz R. Bujard H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2987-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 43Kammerer W. Deuschle U. Gentz R. Bujard H.

The net promoter activity depends upon the local DNA sequence elements that guide the corresponding steps. Consequently, promoters of identical intrinsic strength may exhibit different efficiencies at different steps because of the difference in DNA sequence. We propose here that even a regulator can also exert varying effects at the energetics of different steps in the same promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2157424748,"Growth-blocking peptide (GBP) is a 25-amino acid cytokine isolated from the lepidopteran insect Pseudaletia separata. GBP exhibits various biological activities such as regulation of larval growth of insects, proliferation of a few kinds of cultured cells, and stimulation of a class of insect immune cells called plasmatocytes. The tertiary structure of GBP consists of a well structured core domain and disordered N and C termini. Our previous studies revealed that, in addition to the structured core, specific residues in the unstructured N-terminal region (Glu 1The abbreviations used are: GBP, growth-blocking peptide; PSP, plasmatocyte spreading peptide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect.1The abbreviations used are: GBP, growth-blocking peptide; PSP, plasmatocyte spreading peptide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. and Phe3) are also essential for the plasmatocyte-stimulating activity. In this study, a number of deletion, insertion, and site-directed mutants targeting the unstructured N-terminal residues of GBP were constructed to gain more detailed insight into the mode of interaction between the N-terminal region and GBP receptor. Alteration of the backbone length of the linker region between the core structure and N-terminal domain reduced plasmatocyte-stimulating activity. The substitutions of Gly5 or Gly6 in this linker region with more bulky residues, such as Phe and Pro, also remarkably reduced this activity. We conclude that the interaction of GBP with its receptor depends on the relative position of the N-terminal domain to the core structure, and therefore the backbone flexibility of Gly residues in the linker region is necessary for adoption of a proper conformation suited to receptor binding. Additionally, antagonistic experiments using deletion mutants confirmed that not only the core domain but also the N-terminal region of GBP are required for “receptor-binding,” and furthermore Phe3 is a binding determinant of the N-terminal domain. Growth-blocking peptide (GBP) is a 25-amino acid cytokine isolated from the lepidopteran insect Pseudaletia separata. GBP exhibits various biological activities such as regulation of larval growth of insects, proliferation of a few kinds of cultured cells, and stimulation of a class of insect immune cells called plasmatocytes. The tertiary structure of GBP consists of a well structured core domain and disordered N and C termini. Our previous studies revealed that, in addition to the structured core, specific residues in the unstructured N-terminal region (Glu 1The abbreviations used are: GBP, growth-blocking peptide; PSP, plasmatocyte spreading peptide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect.1The abbreviations used are: GBP, growth-blocking peptide; PSP, plasmatocyte spreading peptide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. and Phe3) are also essential for the plasmatocyte-stimulating activity. In this study, a number of deletion, insertion, and site-directed mutants targeting the unstructured N-terminal residues of GBP were constructed to gain more detailed insight into the mode of interaction between the N-terminal region and GBP receptor. Alteration of the backbone length of the linker region between the core structure and N-terminal domain reduced plasmatocyte-stimulating activity. The substitutions of Gly5 or Gly6 in this linker region with more bulky residues, such as Phe and Pro, also remarkably reduced this activity. We conclude that the interaction of GBP with its receptor depends on the relative position of the N-terminal domain to the core structure, and therefore the backbone flexibility of Gly residues in the linker region is necessary for adoption of a proper conformation suited to receptor binding. Additionally, antagonistic experiments using deletion mutants confirmed that not only the core domain but also the N-terminal region of GBP are required for “receptor-binding,” and furthermore Phe3 is a binding determinant of the N-terminal domain. Growth-blocking peptide (GBP) 1The abbreviations used are: GBP, growth-blocking peptide; PSP, plasmatocyte spreading peptide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. was initially identified as a peptidyl hormone that retards the larval development of the armyworm Pseudaletia separata (1Hayakawa Y.

High concentrations of GBP induce significant reductions in larval growth, whereas low concentrations of GBP stimulate larval growth, thus suggesting that GBP acts as a growth factor in insects. Subsequent studies have shown that GBP has multiple functions, including stimulation of specific insect immune cells (plasmatocytes), proliferation of various types of cultured cells, and paralysis of larvae (5Hayakawa Y.

Furthermore, our recent study showed that GBP stimulates cell proliferation of human keratinocyte cells through direct binding and activation of epidermal growth factor receptors (8Ohnishi A. Oda Y.

GBP is a 25-amino acid peptide containing a disordered N terminus (residues 1–6) and a structured core (residues 7–22) defined by a disulfide bond and a short antiparallel β-sheet (9Aizawa T.

Interestingly, both the structured core region of GBP and the disordered N-terminal region are required for biological activity (10Aizawa T. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Fujinitani N. Clark K.D.

Previous studies demonstrated that the first three residues of the N terminus (Glu-Asn-Phe) of GBP and plasmatocyte spreading peptide (PSP) from Pseudoplusia includens play a critical role in plasmatocyte-stimulating activity (11Tada M.

Because of this consensus ENF sequence, these homologues are now referred to as members of the ENF peptide family (Fig. 1) (14Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recent studies using mutants with specific point mutations or alterations to the ENF sequence in GBP as well as PSP showed the possibility that Phe3 interacts with putative receptors in plasmatocytes via its hydrophobic effect (11Tada M. Aizawa T. Shinohara Y. Matsubara K. Miura K. Yoshida M. Shitara K. Kouno T. Mizuguchi M. Nitta K. Hayakawa Y. Kawano K. J. Biol.

Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the present study we focused on the two glycine residues (Gly5 and Gly6) that are located in the linker region between the well structured core and the N-terminal ENF motif (Fig. 2A). Gly5 and Gly6 are highly conserved within the ENF peptide family. Because it has no side chain, glycine is more flexible than other residues and is often found in areas of the peptide backbone that need to move or hinge (15Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar). We therefore predict that the flexibility of the Gly-Gly sequence in the linker region plays an important role in allowing the N-terminal activation site to interact with receptors. To confirm this idea, we constructed a number of GBP mutants in which various N-terminal residues, mainly Gly5 and Gly6, are specifically altered by substitution or deletion. We then investigated the biological activity of these mutant peptides and their interaction with a putative receptor using bioassays and NMR analysis. Animals—P. separata was reared on an artificial diet at 25 ± 1 °C with a photoperiod of 16 h of light and 8 h of dark (1Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10813-10816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Penultimate instar larvae undergoing ecdysis between 2 and 2.5 h after lights on were designated as day 0 last instar larvae (1Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10813-10816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide Preparation—All of the mutants used in this study were prepared by the Escherichia coli expression system. Expression and purification of peptide mutants was performed using our procedure previously established (11Tada M. Aizawa T. Shinohara Y. Matsubara K. Miura K. Yoshida M. Shitara K. Kouno T. Mizuguchi M. Nitta K. Hayakawa Y. Kawano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10778-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding the entire GBP sequence was used as a template, and polymerase chain reactions were performed with each of the mutated GBP primers. We also used a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) for construction of recombinant plasmids containing point-mutated GBP sequences. GBP mutants were expressed as thioredoxin fusion proteins and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The 15N-labeling was achieved by growing the bacteria in minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. The purified proteins were cleaved by enterokinase enzyme (Invitrogen) and further purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The peptides after the HPLC purification were judged to be homogeneous after a second analysis by HPLC. The purity of each mutant was above 95% as estimated from HPLC. We obtained purified GBP mutants at a rate of about 10 mg per liter of LB medium. The purified peptides were further confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics). Plasmatocyte-stimulating Assay—GBP possesses a hemocyte-stimulating activity that induces a specific class of insect immune cells called plasmatocytes to spread and adhere to foreign surfaces (6Clark K.D. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetkiattikul H. King D. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Plasmatocyte-stimulating activities of the prepared GBP mutants were assayed in 96-well culture plates (Nunc) using methods similar to those of Clark et al. (6Clark K.D. Pech L.L. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23440-23447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hemocytes were collected from full-grown (Day 5) last instar larvae of the armyworm, and plasmatocytes were isolated from other kinds of hemocytes using Percoll gradients. Plasmatocytes were collected from the 40–60% Percoll interface. The isolated plasmatocytes were washed twice in Excell-400 medium (JRH Scientific) and then resuspended in the same medium (∼5.0 × 103 cells/100 μl). Three microliters of various concentrations of each peptide sample was mixed with 57 μl of cell suspension in the wells. The percentage of plasmatocytes spread in an assay was scored 20 min after the mixing by counting about 200 cells from a randomly selected view. Antagonism Assay—Antagonistic activities were assayed according to the following procedure that was slightly modified from that of the plasmatocyte-stimulating assay mentioned above. The plasmatocyte suspension was prepared using the same procedure as the stimulating assay and was preincubated with the mutant peptides for 10 min at room temperature. Then, the GBP solution was added to the cell mixture (final concentration, 100 nm), and the percentage of spread plasmatocytes was counted after incubation for 20 min by the same procedure as that of the plasmatocyte-stimulating assay. NMR Spectroscopy—All experiments were carried out on a Bruker DMX-500 spectrometer at 25 °C. The chemical shifts were measured from the internal standard of sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. Each mutant of GBP was dissolved at a final concentration of 0.3–0.7 mm in 350–500 μl of buffer containing 90% H2O/10% D2O, with 20 mm sodium phosphate at pH 6.5. All one-dimensional spectra were recorded during suppression of the water signal by WATER-GATE pulse (16Piatto M. Saudek V. Skelenar V. J. Bimol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar). The NMR spectra of 15N-labeled samples were recorded under the same condition with nonlabeled samples except for the peptide concentration range of 1.6–2.7 mm, using {15N-1H} heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) (17Palmer A.G. II I Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar) and 15N-edited NOESY (18Kay L.E. Marion D. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 72-84Google Scholar). Amido resonance assignments of the G5F and G6F mutants were made on the basis of the previously assigned 1H resonances of wild-type GBP using the measured 15N-edited spectra (9Aizawa T. Fujinitani N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1887-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 15N Relaxation Measurement—Measurements of the longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times and the heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) of 15N nuclei were carried out as described previously (19Mine S. Tate S. Ueda T. Kainosho M. Imoto T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1547-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed and analyzed using NMR Pipe (20Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and PIPP (21Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The peak intensities of each cross-peak in a series of two-dimensional NMR data were extracted using NMR Pipe based on the peak position defined by the contour averaging algorithm with the program PIPP. A series of extracted intensity profiles of each cross-peak was used for the calculation of the T1 and T2 relaxation times, using a single-exponential model function. The steady-state 1H-15N NOE values were determined from the ratios of the intensities of the peaks with and without proton saturation. Mutations in the Unstructured N-terminal Region of GBP Do Not Alter the Structured Core of the Peptide—Prior studies have examined the relationship between GBP structure and function using a variety of mutants (10Aizawa T. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Fujinitani N. Clark K.D. Strand M.R. Miura K. Koganesawa N. Kumaki Y. Demura M. Nitta K. Kawano K. J. Biol.

These experiments showed that GBP mutants whose secondary structures were disrupted relative to wild type GBP had no activity, implying that the core structure was indispensable for the biological activity (10Aizawa T.

However, mutants in the unstructured N-terminal domain, such as a deletion of Glu1, also result in a complete loss of activity despite retaining the native core structure of GBP (10Aizawa T.

Experiments with mutants of GBP and PSP clearly showed that both the structure and hydrophobicity of the side chain of Phe3 are important for activity (11Tada M. Aizawa T. Shinohara Y. Matsubara K. Miura K. Yoshida M. Shitara K. Kouno T. Mizuguchi M. Nitta K. Hayakawa Y. Kawano K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Extensive analyses of PSP mutants at Phe3 indicated that a branched carbon chain with a methylene spacer at the third residue is the minimal structural motif that is required for an active peptide (13Clark K.D. Volkman B.F. Thoetkiattikul H. Hayakawa Y. Strand M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37431-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The fact that the three N-terminal residues (an ENF motif) of GBP and PSP are also completely conserved in all ENF family peptides suggests that these three residues may play a critical role in receptor activation. Thus, there has been great interest in the structural and functional relationship between the core domain and the N-terminal disordered region of these peptides. Based on these previous findings, we presumed that the highly conserved Gly residues (Gly-Gly sequence, fifth and sixth residues in GBP) in the “linker” region connecting the structured core and the ENF motif could perform a key role in this peptide as a flexible hinge-like element. To clarify this role, we produced a series of mutants modified in this linker region (Fig. 2B). Before assaying for activity, we first determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy whether these mutations had any effects on the conformation of the core domain. One-dimensional NMR spectra of the amide proton region of GBP and all the mutants constructed in this study, except for (3–25)-GBP and (4–25)-GBP, are shown in Fig. 3. If specific mutations in the N-terminal region of GBP were to perturb the tertiary structure of the GBP core domain, some changes or loss of the chemical shift dispersion would be observed in the 1H NMR spectra due to their sensitivity to alterations of the secondary and tertiary structure of the peptide (10Aizawa T. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Fujinitani N. Clark K.D. Strand M.R. Miura K. Koganesawa N. Kumaki Y. Demura M. Nitta K. Kawano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31813-31818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Our experiments showed no significant difference in chemical shift dispersion between wild-type GBP and all the mutants tested. In particular, signals for the amide resonances of Met12, Thr14, and Lys20, all components of the rigid core structure of native GBP, remain unaffected, suggesting that the native core structure of wild-type GBP is conserved. These results confirmed that any effects these mutants may have on activity would be due to local effects in the N-terminal domain rather than conformational changes of the core. These results also suggested that the N-terminal domain of GBP does not contribute to maintaining the tertiary structure of the core domain. Although the 1H NMR spectra of (3–25)-GBP and (4–25)-GBP was not measured, it is reasonable to assume that (3–25)-GBP and (4–25)-GBP also retained the native core structure, because even the (7–25)-GBP mutant without the entire N-terminal region retained the native structure of wild-type GBP. The Length of the Linker Region between the Core Domain and the ENF Motif Is Critical for Activity—As a first step toward examining the role of the distinctive Gly5-Gly6 sequence, we constructed a set of GBP mutants that altered the length of the peptide backbone between the ENF motif and the core domain. These included the deletion mutant ((-1G)-GBP) and the insertion mutant ((+1G)-GBP), in which the ENF motif was positioned, respectively, either closer to or farther from the core domain by addition or subtraction of a Gly residue (Fig. 4A). The (-1G)-GBP lost almost all activity, revealing that a certain minimum length of the backbone “linker” region is required for activity. The (+1G)-GBP also had no activity up to 10 nm and only about one-half of wild-type GBP even at a concentration of 100 nm. These results show that the activity of GBP is affected by the distance of the ENF motif from the core domain. We also prepared a hexapeptide (ENFSGG) that consisted of the first six residues of GBP and a deletion mutant ((7–25)-GBP) lacking the segment corresponding to the hexapeptide. These mutants mimicked a normal GBP molecule in sequence, yet lacked any covalent attachment between the core domain and the N-terminal region (Fig. 4B). As expected, (7–25)-GBP alone did not possess any activity without the critical ENF motif. Moreover, (7–25)-GBP exhibited no activity even when mixed with the N-terminal hexapeptide, indicating that the peptide bond between the N-terminal and core region of GBP is indispensable for activity. Based on these data, we concluded that the proper length of the backbone linker that connects the ENF motif to the core domain is essential in activating GBP receptors. Gly-Gly Linker Substitutions That Restrict the Conformation of the N Terminus Greatly Decrease Activity—To characterize the functional significance of Gly5 and Gly6 in more detail, additional mutants were constructed at these positions using site-directed mutagenesis. If the Gly side chains (hydrogens) are directly involved in receptor activation, then the addition of methyl groups to these Gly residues may have some effect on activity. However, Ala substitutions at either Gly5 or Gly6 (G5A, G6A) had no effect on the activity (Fig. 5), suggesting that the side chains (hydrogens) of these Gly residues are not essential for receptor binding and that the relatively small volume of the linker region and its flexibility may be more important. This prediction was confirmed by using substitution mutants in which Gly5 and Gly6 were substituted with Phe or Pro (G5F, G5P, G6F, and G6P), producing peptides that were much more restricted in their N-terminal polypeptide backbone conformation (Fig. 5). Interestingly, substitutions at these two positions showed strikingly different results. A Phe substitution at Gly6 (G6F) slightly reduced activity: its activity was less at 10 nm than that of the wild-type GBP but was almost same at 100 nm. In contrast, G5F had almost no activity and only exhibited a low level of response at 1 μm, the highest concentration tested. In the case of Pro substitutions, although G5P had no activity even at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 5A), the activity of G6P was only reduced about one order of magnitude relative to that of wild-type GBP (Fig. 5B). Thus, the presence of a Gly residue at position 6 in GBP seems to be less important for activity than that at position 5. In addition, the effect of Pro substitutions was more significant than that of Phe substitution in both cases at Gly5 and Gly6 in terms of interfering with the activation of plasmatocytes. This difference is thought to be due to the fact that Pro possesses the strongest stereochemical constraints of any amino acid residue by potentially restricting the degree of freedom of the backbone dihedral angles (15Richardson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1981; 34: 167-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the high flexibility of the linker residues, especially Gly5, is crucial for interaction with the putative GBP receptor. Phe3 Is Required for Efficient Binding of GBP to Plasmatocytes—Our previous studies identified several residues crucial for the plasmatocyte-stimulating activity of GBP (10Aizawa T. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Fujinitani N. Clark K.D. Strand M.R. Miura K. Koganesawa N. Kumaki Y. Demura M. Nitta K. Kawano K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10778-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but it has been impossible to distinguish between residues necessary for receptor binding and those involved in receptor activation. To distinguish between binding and activation, we measured the ability of the inactive N-terminal GBP mutants to antagonize the plasmatocyte-stimulating activity of intact GBP. The N-terminal deletion mutants, all of which are inactive analogues of GBP, should be capable of antagonizing GBP if they retain their ability to bind. As expected, the deletion mutant lacking the first two residues of wild-type GBP ((3–25)-GBP) efficiently antagonized the plasmatocyte-stimulating activity of wild-type GBP, suggesting that (3–25)-GBP still retains critical determinants for receptor binding (Fig. 6). However, the additional deletion of Phe3 ((4–25)-GBP) from the N terminus, or all of the residues in the N-terminal disordered region ((7–25)-GBP) led to dramatic reductions in their ability to antagonize relative to (3–25)-GBP. These data clearly indicated that Phe3 is a critical residue for receptor binding of GBP. Additionally, the (7–25)-GBP did not antagonize the stimulating activity of wild-type GBP at all, implying an inability of the core domain of GBP to bind to the putative receptor without the disordered N-terminal region. The N-terminal hexapeptide ENFSGG alone also exhibited no antagonistic activity (data not shown). These results suggest that when the N terminus and the core domain of GBP are separated that neither has the capacity for a stable peptide-receptor interaction. Based on these findings, it seems reasonable that the linker region between the two domains makes it possible for them to synergistically bind to the putative receptor by anchoring the N-terminal domain to the core domain. Our data clearly demonstrate that Phe3 is the most important source of the binding energy in the N-terminal domain. Furthermore, (4–25)-GBP slightly exhibited antagonistic activity only at a concentration of 100 μm, whereas (7–25)-GBP almost completely lacked the activity, suggesting that the linker region, containing Gly5 and Gly6, is also involved to some extent in receptor binding. We also examined whether the (3–25)-GBP mutant antagonizes the mitogenic activity of wild-type GBP. Interestingly, in contrast to its ability to antagonize plasmatocyte-stimulating activity, the mitogenic activity was not antagonized by (3–25)-GBP (data not shown). These results support our previous proposal that mitogenic and plasmatocyte-stimulating activities may be mediated by different types of GBP receptors (10Aizawa T. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A.

Conformational Dynamics of GBP and the GBP Mutants G5F and G6F—15N NMR relaxation measurements can be used to characterize the intramolecular conformational dynamics of proteins and peptides (23Farrow N.A.

To elucidate the dynamics of the N-terminal domain of GBP, a set of 15N relaxation data, including R1 (= 1/T1) and R2 (= 1/T2) rates and {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs were measured for wild-type GBP and the Gly replacement mutants G5F and G6F at 500 MHz and 25 °C (Fig. 7). Because calculation of Model-free parameters using the Model-free formalism would be impractical due to the lower molecular mass and rotational correlation time of GBP (∼2.8kDa), we did not perform a Model-free analysis of the data and extracted only the general trends for dynamic behavior (24Lipari G.

Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 133: 4371-4380Google Scholar). In general, it is believed that 15N transverse relaxation rates (R2) lower than the average R2 value for the molecule indicate internal motion. As expected, low R2 values for the disordered N and C termini of GBP were observed, suggesting an increased mobility due to flexibility in these regions. Additionally, much lower NOE intensities were exhibited by both ends of GBP, showing that they are less ordered than the internal domain of the molecule. These results are collectively indicative of a lack of structural definition in these regions and are in agreement with the solution structure of GBP previously determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2A). Of particular interest is the fact that the G5F mutant exhibited almost the same R2 value as wild-type GBP despite its greater loss of stimulating activity than the G6F mutant, suggesting that Phe substitution at Gly5 has little effect on the mobility of the N-terminal region of GBP. This also implies that the greatly reduced activity of the G5F mutant may be mainly due to steric hindrance between the aromatic side chain of the Phe and the putative binding site of the linker region on the receptor. Receptor Binding Model of GBP—Together with our previous published data, the results presented here suggest a mechanism by which GBP binds to its putative receptor. First, the initial binding of GBP is most likely mediated by the well structured core domain of GBP. In support of this, mutant peptides that result in a loss of structure, such as the D16β mutant, which contained the β-aspartyl bond between Asp16 and Gly, and double mutant C7.19A, which deleted the disulfide bridge in the core domain, are completely inactive (11Tada M. Aizawa T. Shinohara Y. Matsubara K. Miura K. Yoshida M. Shitara K. Kouno T. Mizuguchi M. Nitta K. Hayakawa Y. Kawano K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18491-18496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding of the core domain to the receptor is then followed by binding of the unstructured N terminus, an interaction mediated primarily by Phe3, as has been demonstrated in both GBP and PSP (11Tada M. Aizawa T. Shinohara Y. Matsubara K. Miura K. Yoshida M. Shitara K. Kouno T. Mizuguchi M. Nitta K. Hayakawa Y. Kawano K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37431-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the hexapeptide ENFSGG is both inactive and unable to antagonize, we assume that the interaction of the core domain of GBP with its receptor induces the interaction between Phe3 and a specific binding pocket on the receptor, presumably a hydrophobic cavity. Consequently, the N-terminal activating residue, Glu1, is presented to its complimentary site on the receptor and is ultimately responsible for activating it. We show here that the linker region of GBP is also essential for its activity. The inherent flexibility of the linker, which permits a high degree of freedom of the conformation of the N terminus, may be required to allow the ENF motif to assume the proper conformation necessary to contact and activate the GBP receptor. The different activities exhibited by the Gly5 and Gly6 mutants may be due to their putative binding site in the receptor, which is likely to adopt a groove-like structure. The higher antagonistic activity of the (4–25)-GBP mutant relative to (7–25)-GBP is also consistent with this model, because it appears that the residues in the linker region also bind with some affinity to the putative binding cavity. This is presumably the reason why (4–25)-GBP had antagonistic activity higher than (7–25)-GBP. In addition to this requirement for flexibility, we show that the length of the linker region is critical for activity. A single Gly addition to the linker region still allows for some receptor activation, but removing a Gly results in a large loss of activity. The decreased length of the N terminus presumably precludes the N-terminal amine from gaining access to its activation site and suggests a highly precise fit between peptide and receptor. Although the structure of GBP receptor has not yet been reported, recent studies suggesting that the dissociating constant for 125I-labeled GBP in plasmatocytes was 1.26 nm. 2Y. Oda and Y. Hayakawa, unpublished results. Interestingly, this Kd values for GBP in plasmatocyte were different from that in insect Sf-9 cells, 0.25 nm (8Ohnishi A. Oda Y. Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37974-37979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In accordance with this result, we have previously reported that GBP has multiple activities, and experiments using the GBP mutants suggest that a different type of GBP receptor may mediate each of these activities (10Aizawa T. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Fujinitani N. Clark K.D. Strand M.R. Miura K. Koganesawa N. Kumaki Y. Demura M. Nitta K. Kawano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31813-31818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the case of mitogenic activity of GBP toward Sf-9 cells, it is likely that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor triggers a series of intracellular signaling events (8Ohnishi A. Oda Y. Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37974-37979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the case of plasmatocytes stimulation by GBP, however, the signaling mechanism is still unknown. In the present study, we have proposed a model of GBP receptor binding in plasmatocytes that relies on the extensive data provided by the recombinant GBP mutants. The data reported here confirm the significance of the flexible N-terminal region of GBP and are also expected to provide useful clues as to the mechanism of receptor activation in other activities that GBP exhibits such as mitogenic activity in cultured cells."
