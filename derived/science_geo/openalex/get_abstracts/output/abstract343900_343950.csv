https://openalex.org/W2022705258,"Room-temperature powder x-ray diffraction profiles have been obtained at hydrostatic pressures P = 0 and 1.2 gigapascals on the solid phase of cubic C(60) (""fullerite""). Within experimental error, the linear compressibility d(ln a)/dP is the same as the interlayer compressibility d(ln c)/dP of hexagonal graphite, consistent with van der Waals intermolecular bonding. The volume compressibility -d(ln V)/dP is 7.0 +/- 1 x 10(-12) square centimeter per dyne, 3 and 40 times the values for graphite and diamond, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1971247426,"Proximate constraints on egg size, number, and total clutch mass in side-blotched lizards were examined by experimentally reducing average clutch size from 4.6 eggs to one, two, and three eggs. Eggs from experimentally altered clutches were larger than those from controls, reflecting the trade-off between egg size and number. Moreover, the increased frequency of females with oviducally bound eggs or eggs that burst at oviposition suggests that egg size in clutches with very few eggs are at a functional upper size limit. These proximate constraints may also limit evolution of egg size in another group of lizards (Anolis) that only produces one-egged clutches."
https://openalex.org/W2093236091,"The nature of the Arctic polar stratosphere is observed to be similar in many respects to that of the Antarctic polar stratosphere, where an ozone hole has been identified. Most of the available chlorine (HCl and ClONO(2)) was converted by reactions on polar stratospheric clouds to reactive ClO and Cl(2)O(2) throughout the Arctic polar vortex before midwinter. Reactive nitrogen was converted to HNO(3), and some, with spatial inhomogeneity, fell out of the stratosphere. These chemical changes ensured characteristic ozone losses of 10 to 15% at altitudes inside the polar vortex where polar stratospheric clouds had occurred. These local losses can translate into 5 to 8% losses in the vertical column abundance of ozone. As the amount of stratospheric chlorine inevitably increases by 50% over the next two decades, ozone losses recognizable as an ozone hole may well appear."
https://openalex.org/W2024872362,Shanidar I and III from Iraq have the same peculiar form of pubis as Tabūn I from Palestine. These are the only such pubes known to exist. These facts suggest that Neanderthal man (Shanidar-Tabūn) and an early variety of modern man (Skhūl) coexisted during Mousterian times in this part of the world.
https://openalex.org/W2042968221,"The properties of a molecule are determined by the distribution of its electrons. This distribution can be described by the charge density, which is readily obtained from the wave functions derived by ab initio molecular orbital calculations. The charge density may be analyzed in a number of different fashions to give information about the effects of substituents, structural changes, and electronic excitation on the properties of molecules; one common procedure makes use of projection density or charge difference plots. Charge density also may be partitioned among atoms, and by numerical integration over appropriate volume elements one may obtain atomic charges, dipoles, kinetic energies, and other properties of the atoms in a molecule. Many chemical phenomena have been analyzed in terms of charge densities."

https://openalex.org/W1996642752,"Near-infrared spectra of a bright and a dark thermal emission feature on the night side of Venus have been obtained from 2.2 to 2.5 micrometers (microm) at a spectral resolution of 1200 to 1500. Both bright and dark features show numerous weak absorption bands produced by CO(2), CO, water vapor, and other gases. The bright feature (hot spot) emits more radiation than the dark feature (cold spot) throughout this spectral region, but the largest contrasts occur between 2.21 and 2.32 microm, where H(2)SO(4) clouds and a weak CO(2) band provide the only known sources of extinction. The contrast decreases by 55 to 65 percent at wavelengths longer than 2.34 microm, where CO, clouds, and water vapor also absorb and scatter upwelling radiation. This contrast reduction may provide direct spectroscopic evidence for horizontal variations in the water vapor concentrations in the Venus atmosphere at levels below the cloud tops."

https://openalex.org/W2053310106,The author outlines process by which U.S. Census Bureau counts countrys population. He reviews two current techniques for evaluating or adjusting census results use of administrative records to make alternative population estimates and capture-recapture methods using data from an independent sample survey. The author concludes that census is remarkably accurate that there is little hard evidence that current adjustment methodologies would improve accuracy of census results and that the present state of art probably cannot support adjustment of 1990 census.
