https://openalex.org/W2605310600,"Recent reform of medical education highlights the growing concerns about the capability of the current educational model to equip medical school students with essential skills for future career development. In the field of ophthalmology, although many attempts have been made to address the problem of the decreasing teaching time and the increasing load of course content, a growing body of literature indicates the need to reform the current ophthalmology teaching strategies. Flipped classroom is a new pedagogical model in which students develop a basic understanding of the course materials before class, and use in-class time for learner-centered activities, such as group discussion and presentation. However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the flipped classroom in ophthalmology education. This study, for the first time, assesses the use of flipped classroom in ophthalmology, specifically glaucoma and ocular trauma clerkship teaching. A total number of 44 international medical school students from diverse background were enrolled in this study, and randomly divided into two groups. One group took the flipped glaucoma classroom and lecture-based ocular trauma classroom, while the other group took the flipped ocular trauma classroom and lecture-based glaucoma classroom. In the traditional lecture-based classroom, students attended the didactic lecture and did the homework after class. In the flipped classroom, students were asked to watch the prerecorded lectures before the class, and use the class time for homework discussion. Both the teachers and students were asked to complete feedback questionnaires after the classroom. We found that the two groups did not show differences in the final exam scores. However, the flipped classroom helped students to develop skills in problem solving, creative thinking and team working. Also, compared to the lecture-based classroom, both teachers and students were more satisfied with the flipped classroom. Interestingly, students had a more positive attitude towards the flipped ocular trauma classroom than the flipped glaucoma classroom regarding the teaching process, the course materials, and the value of the classroom. Therefore, the flipped classroom model in ophthalmology teaching showed promise as an effective approach to promote active learning."

The objective of this study was to estimate prevalence of self-reported multimorbidity in Brazilian adults (≥18 years old) according to socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. A descriptive study is presented herein, based on data from the National Health Survey, which was a household-based survey carried out in Brazil in 2013. Data on 60,202 adult participants over the age of 18 were included. Prevalences and its respective confidence intervals (95%) were estimated according to sex, age, education level, marital status, self-reported skin color, area of residence, occupation and federative units (states). Poisson regression models univariate and multivariate were used to evaluate the association between socioeconomic and demographic variables with multimorbidity. To observe the combinations of chronic conditions the most common groups in pairs, trios, quartets and quintets of chronic diseases were observed. The prevalence of multimorbidity was 23.6% and was higher among women, in individuals over 60 years of age, people with low educational levels, people living with partner, in urban areas and among unemployed persons. The states of the South and Southeast regions presented higher prevalence. The most common groups of chronic diseases were metabolic and musculoskeletal diseases. The results demonstrated high prevalence of multimorbidity in Brazil. The study also revealed that a considerable share of the economically active population presented two or more chronic diseases. Data of this research indicated that socioeconomic and demographic aspects must be considered during the planning of health services and development of prevention and treatment strategies for chronic diseases, and consequently, multimorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2604643842,"Stroke affects mortality, functional ability, quality of life and incurs costs. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the costs of stroke care in Sweden by level of disability and stroke type (ischemic (IS) or hemorrhagic stroke (ICH)).Resource use during first and second year following a stroke was estimated based on a research database containing linked data from several registries. Costs were estimated for the acute and post-acute management of stroke, including direct (health care consumption and municipal services) and indirect (productivity losses) costs. Resources and costs were estimated per stroke type and functional disability categorised by Modified Rankin Scale (mRS).The results indicated that the average costs per patient following a stroke were 350,000SEK/€37,000-480,000SEK/€50,000, dependent on stroke type and whether it was the first or second year post stroke. Large variations were identified between different subgroups of functional disability and stroke type, ranging from annual costs of 100,000SEK/€10,000-1,100,000SEK/€120,000 per patient, with higher costs for patients with ICH compared to IS and increasing costs with more severe functional disability.Functional outcome is a major determinant on costs of stroke care. The stroke type associated with worse outcome (ICH) was also consistently associated to higher costs. Measures to improve function are not only important to individual patients and their family but may also decrease the societal burden of stroke."

In this study, we incorporate neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), marital status, and distance from transplant center with previously studied factors to provide a comprehensive analysis of sociodemographic factors influencing treatments for ALL and AML. Methods Using the California Cancer Registry, we performed a retrospective, population-based study of patients ≥15 years old with ALL (n = 3,221) or AML (n = 10,029) from 2003 through 2012. The effect of age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, nSES, and distance from nearest transplant center on receiving no treatment, chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy then HCT was analyzed. Results No treatment, chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy then HCT were received by 11%, 75%, and 14% of ALL patients and 36%, 53%, and 11% of AML patients, respectively. For ALL patients ≥60 years old, HCT utilization increased from 5% in 2005 to 9% in 2012 (p = 0.03). For AML patients ≥60 years old, chemotherapy utilization increased from 39% to 58% (p<0.001) and HCT utilization from 5% to 9% from 2005 to 2012 (p<0.001). Covariate-adjusted analysis revealed decreasing relative risk (RR) of chemotherapy with increasing age for both ALL and AML (trend p <0.001). Relative to non-Hispanic whites, lower HCT utilization occurred in Hispanic [ALL, RR = 0.80 (95% CI = 0.65–0.98); AML, RR = 0.86 (95% CI = 0.75–0.99)] and non-Hispanic black patients [ALL, RR = 0.40 (95% CI = 0.18–0.89); AML, RR = 0.60 (95% CI = 0.44–0.83)]. Compared to married patients, never married patients had a lower RR of receiving chemotherapy [ALL, RR = 0.96 (95% CI = 0.92–0.99); AML, RR = 0.94 (95% CI = 0.90–0.98)] or HCT [ALL, RR = 0.58 (95% CI = 0.47–0.71); AML, RR = 0.80 (95% CI = 0.70–0.90)]. Lower nSES quintiles predicted lower chemotherapy and HCT utilization for both ALL and AML (trend p <0.001). Conclusions Older age, lower nSES, and being unmarried predicted lower utilization of chemotherapy and HCT among ALL and AML patients whereas having Hispanic or black race/ethnicity predicted lower rates of HCT. Addressing these disparities may increase utilization of curative therapies in underserved acute leukemia populations."
https://openalex.org/W2604647356,"Combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to analyze cortical reactivity and connectivity. However, the effects of corticospinal and peripheral muscle activity on TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) are not well understood. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the relationship between cortico-spinal activity, in the form of peripheral motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and the TEPs from motor areas, along with the connectivity among activated brain areas. TMS was applied to left and right motor cortex (M1), separately, at motor threshold while multi-channel EEG responses were recorded in 17 healthy human subjects. Cortical excitability and source imaging analysis were performed for all trials at each stimulation location, as well as comparing trials resulting in MEPs to those without. Connectivity analysis was also performed comparing trials resulting in MEPs to those without. Cortical excitability results significantly differed between the MEP and no-MEP conditions for left M1 TMS at 60 ms (CP1, CP3, C1) and for right M1 TMS at 54 ms (CP6, C6). Connectivity analysis revealed higher outflow and inflow between M1 and somatosensory cortex bi-directionally for trials with MEPs than those without for both left M1 TMS (at 60, 100, 164 ms) and right M1 TMS (at 54, 100, and 164 ms). Both TEP amplitudes and connectivity measures related to motor and somatosensory areas ipsilateral to the stimulation were shown to correspond with peripheral MEP amplitudes. This suggests that cortico-spinal activation, along with the resulting somatosensory feedback, affects the cortical activity and dynamics within motor areas reflected in the TEPs. The findings suggest that TMS-EEG, along with adaptive connectivity estimators, can be used to evaluate the cortical dynamics associated with sensorimotor integration and proprioceptive manipulation along with the influence of peripheral muscle feedback."

https://openalex.org/W2604800140,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a voxel-wise analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values may differentiate between progressive disease (PD) and pseudoprogression (PsP) in patients with high-grade glioma using the parametric response map, a newly introduced postprocessing tool.Twenty-eight patients with proven PD and seven patients with PsP were identified in this retrospective feasibility study. For all patients ADC baseline and follow-up maps on four subsequent MRIs were available. ADC maps were coregistered on contrast enhanced T1-weighted follow-up images. Subsequently, enhancement in the follow-up contrast enhanced T1-weighted image was manually delineated and a reference region of interest (ROI) was drawn in the contralateral white matter. Both ROIs were transferred to the ADC images. Relative ADC (rADC) (baseline)/reference ROI values and rADC (follow up)/reference ROI values were calculated for each voxel within the ROI. The corresponding voxels of rADC (follow up) and rADC (baseline) were subtracted and the percentage of all voxels within the ROI that exceeded the threshold of 0.25 was quantified.rADC voxels showed a decrease of 59.2% (1st quartile (Q1) 36.7; 3rd quartile (Q3) 78.6) above 0.25 in patients with PD and 18.6% (Q1 3.04; Q3 26.5) in patients with PsP (p = 0.005). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the optimal decreasing rADC cut-off value for identifying PD of > 27.05% (area under the curve 0.844±0.065, sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.86, p = 0.014).This feasibility study shows that the assessment of rADC using parametric response maps might be a promising approach to contribute to the differentiation between PD and PsP. Further research in larger patient cohorts is necessary to finally determine its clinical utility."
https://openalex.org/W2604750655,"Epilepsy is misdiagnosed in up to 25% of patients, leading to serious and long-lasting consequences. Recently, circulating microRNAs have emerged as potential biomarkers in a number of clinical scenarios. The purpose of this study was to identify and to validate circulating microRNAs that could be used as biomarkers in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure plasma levels of three candidate microRNAs in two phases of study: an initial discovery phase with 14 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), 13 with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and 16 controls; and a validation cohort constituted of an independent cohort of 65 patients with MTLE and 83 controls. We found hsa-miR-134 downregulated in patients with MTLE (p = 0.018) but not in patients with FCD, when compared to controls. Furthermore, hsa-miR-134 expression could be used to discriminate MTLE patients with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75. To further assess the robustness of hsa-miR-134 as a biomarker for MTLE, we studied an independent cohort of 65 patients with MTLE, 27 of whom MTLE patients were responsive to pharmacotherapy, and 38 patients were pharmacoresistant and 83 controls. We confirmed that hsa-miR-134 was significantly downregulated in the plasma of patients with MTLE when compared with controls (p < 0.001). In addition, hsa-miR-134 identified patients with MTLE regardless of their response to pharmacotherapy or the presence of MRI signs of hippocampal sclerosis. We revealed that decreased expression of hsa-miR-134 could be a potential non-invasive biomarker to support the diagnosis of patients with MTLE."
https://openalex.org/W2604430094,"Digital dissection is a relatively new technique that has enabled scientists to gain a better understanding of vertebrate anatomy. It can be used to rapidly disseminate detailed, three-dimensional information in an easily accessible manner that reduces the need for destructive, traditional dissections. Here we present the results of a digital dissection on the appendicular musculature of the Australian estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). A better understanding of this until now poorly known system in C. porosus is important, not only because it will expand research into crocodilian locomotion, but because of its potential to inform muscle reconstructions in dinosaur taxa. Muscles of the forelimb and hindlimb are described and three-dimensional interactive models are included based on CT and MRI scans as well as fresh-tissue dissections. Differences in the arrangement of musculature between C. porosus and other groups within the Crocodylia were found. In the forelimb, differences are restricted to a single tendon of origin for triceps longus medialis. For the hindlimb, a reduction in the number of heads of ambiens was noted as well as changes to the location of origin and insertion for iliofibularis and gastrocnemius externus."
https://openalex.org/W2605293523,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease for which there are no disease modifying therapies. Thus, strategies that offer chondroprotective or regenerative capability represent a critical unmet need. Recently, oral consumption of a hydrolyzed type 1 collagen (hCol1) preparation has been reported to reduce pain in human OA and support a positive influence on chondrocyte function. To evaluate the tissue and cellular basis for these effects, we examined the impact of orally administered hCol1 in a model of posttraumatic OA (PTOA). In addition to standard chow, male C57BL/6J mice were provided a daily oral dietary supplement of hCol1 and a meniscal-ligamentous injury was induced on the right knee. At various time points post-injury, hydroxyproline (hProline) assays were performed on blood samples to confirm hCol1 delivery, and joints were harvested for tissue and molecular analyses were performed, including histomorphometry, OARSI and synovial scoring, immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression studies. Confirming ingestion of the supplements, serum hProline levels were elevated in experimental mice administered hCol1. In the hCol1 supplemented mice, chondroprotective effects were observed in injured knee joints, with dose-dependent increases in cartilage area, chondrocyte number and proteoglycan matrix at 3 and 12 weeks post-injury. Preservation of cartilage and increased chondrocyte numbers correlated with reductions in MMP13 protein levels and apoptosis, respectively. Supplemented mice also displayed reduced synovial hyperplasia that paralleled a reduction in Tnf mRNA, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. These findings establish that in the context of murine knee PTOA, daily oral consumption of hCol1 is chondroprotective, anti-apoptotic in articular chondrocytes, and anti-inflammatory. While the underlying mechanism driving these effects is yet to be determined, these findings provide the first tissue and cellular level information explaining the already published evidence of symptom relief supported by hCol1 in human knee OA. These results suggest that oral consumption of hCol1 is disease modifying in the context of PTOA."
https://openalex.org/W2604848721,"Serum concentrations of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) correlate with renal function in cats and SDMA has been shown to be a more reliable and earlier marker for chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared with serum creatinine (Cr). Calcium oxalate uroliths tend to develop in mid-to-older aged cats and kidney stones may cause a reduction in renal function with increased SDMA, but normal serum Cr. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine if cats with kidney stones had increased serum SDMA concentrations, and whether SDMA increased earlier than serum creatinine concentrations. Cats in the colony with kidney stones diagnosed between August 2010 and December 2015 (n = 43) were compared with healthy geriatric cats (n = 21) without kidney stones. Serum SDMA concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and serum Cr concentrations were determined by enzymatic colorimetry. Cats with kidney stones were diagnosed antemortem by radiographic imaging (n = 12) or by postmortem necropsy (n = 31). Retrospectively, serum SDMA was found to be increased above the upper reference limit in 39 of 43 cats with kidney stones. Serum Cr was increased above the upper reference limit in 18 of 43 cats; 6 of these 18 cats had terminal azotemia only. The mean time that serum SDMA was increased before serum Cr was increased was 26.9 months (range 0 to 60 months). Kidney stones were composed of calcium oxalate in 30 of 34 cats. The lifespan for cats with kidney stones (mean, 12.5 years; range, 6.1 to 18.1 years) was shorter (P < 0.001) than for control cats (mean, 15.2 years; range, 13.0 to 17.2 years), suggesting that non-obstructive kidney stones have an effect on mortality rate or rate of CKD progression. In conclusion, if SDMA concentrations are elevated in mid-to-older aged cats, further imaging studies are warranted to check for the presence of kidney stones."

https://openalex.org/W2604950201,"During the fasting month of Ramadan, practicing Saudis develop severe disturbances in sleeping and feeding patterns. Concomitantly, cortisol circadian rhythm is abolished, diurnal cortisol levels are elevated and circulating levels of several adipokines are altered favouring insulin resistance.To examine changes in the expression of CLOCK and glucocorticoid-controlled genes, such as DUSP1 and IL-1α in Saudi adults before and during Ramadan, and to investigate possible associations with selected cardiometabolic risk factors.Healthy young volunteers (5 females, 18 males; mean age +SEM = 23.2 +1.2 years) were evaluated before Ramadan and two weeks into it. Blood samples were collected at 9 am (±1 hour) and twelve hours later for determination of serum lipid profile, high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), and adiponectin. The expression of CLOCK, DUSP1 and IL-1α was evaluated in circulating leukocytes.Mean levels of GGT and morning adiponectin decreased, while those of LDL-c/ HDL-c and atherogenic index (AI) increased significantly in Ramadan compared to Shabaan. There was no significant difference between morning and evening adiponectin during Ramadan, while the diurnal rhythm of hsCRP was lost. CLOCK gene expression mean was significantly higher in morning than in evening during Shabaan. Mean morning and evening DUSP1 mRNA levels showed significant increase during Ramadan compared to Shabaan, however, its diurnal rhythm was maintained. Morning IL-1α mRNA expression remained significantly higher than in the evening during Ramadan, but was markedly decreased compared to Shabaan.Ramadan fasting in Saudi Arabia is associated with improvements in some cardiometabolic risk factors, such as circulating GGT and hsCRP and leukocyte expression of IL-1α mRNA, suggesting that intermittent fasting might have a beneficial component. These benefits may be offset by the previously reported dysregulation in the circadian rhythm, excess glucocorticoid levels and action, and insulin resistance, explaining increased prevalence of cardiometabolic disorders and type 2 diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2604219874,"Optical-biogeochemical relationships of particulate and dissolved organic matter are presented in support of remote sensing of the Baltic Sea pelagic. This system exhibits strong seasonality in phytoplankton community composition and wide gradients of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), properties which are poorly handled by existing remote sensing algorithms. Absorption and scattering properties of particulate matter reflected the seasonality in biological (phytoplankton succession) and physical (thermal stratification) processes. Inherent optical properties showed much wider variability when normalized to the chlorophyll-a concentration compared to normalization to either total suspended matter dry weight or particulate organic carbon. The particle population had the largest optical variability in summer and was dominated by organic matter in both seasons. The geographic variability of CDOM and relationships with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are also presented. CDOM dominated light absorption at blue wavelengths, contributing 81% (median) of the absorption by all water constituents at 400 nm and 63% at 442 nm. Consequentially, 90% of water-leaving radiance at 412 nm originated from a layer (z90) no deeper than approximately 1.0 m. With water increasingly attenuating light at longer wavelengths, a green peak in light penetration and reflectance is always present in these waters, with z90 up to 3.0-3.5 m depth, whereas z90 only exceeds 5 m at biomass < 5 mg Chla m-3. High absorption combined with a weakly scattering particle population (despite median phytoplankton biomass of 14.1 and 4.3 mg Chla m-3 in spring and summer samples, respectively), characterize this sea as a dark water body for which dedicated or exceptionally robust remote sensing techniques are required. Seasonal and regional optical-biogeochemical models, data distributions, and an extensive set of simulated remote-sensing reflectance spectra for testing of remote sensing algorithms are provided as supplementary data."
https://openalex.org/W2604598118,"Parathyroidectomy (PTX) may cause low levels of PTH, leading to an excessive reduction of bone turnover, which is associated with poor outcomes in dialysis patients, including vascular calcification (VC). We aimed to prospectively investigate the impact of PTX on bone remodeling and its potential consequence on the progression of VC in hemodialysis patients. In this prospective study, 19 hemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) were evaluated. All patients underwent laboratorial tests and coronary tomography at baseline and, 6 and 12 months after PTX; bone biopsy was performed at baseline and 12-month. At baseline, all patients had increased PTH levels up to 2500 pg/mL and high turnover bone disease in their bone biopsies. Fourteen (74%) patients had VC. During the follow-up, there was a significant decrease of PTH at 6 and 12-month. At 12-month, 90% of the patients evolved to low turnover bone disease. During the period of the hungry bone syndrome (first 6 months), no change of coronary calcium score was observed. However, calcium score increased significantly thereafter (12th month). There was an association between VC progression and the severity of low turnover bone disease. In conclusion, the shift from high to low turnover bone disease after PTX occurs in parallel to VC progression, contributing to the understanding of the complex pathophysiology involving mineral metabolism and cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2604951002,"Introduction Preeclampsia (PE) is a gestational disorder, manifested in the second half of pregnancy by maternal hypertension, proteinuria and generalized edema. PE is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, accounting for nearly 40% of all premature births worldwide. Bioactive sphingolipids are emerging as key molecules involved in etiopathogenesis of PE, characterized by maternal angiogenic imbalance and symptoms of metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to compare the cross-gestational profile of circulating bioactive sphingolipids in maternal plasma from preeclamptic (PE) versus normotensive control (CTL) subjects with the goal of identifying sphingolipids as candidate first trimester biomarkers of PE for early prediction of the disease. Methods A prospective cohort of patients was sampled at the first, second and third trimester of pregnancy for each patient (11–14, 22–24, and 32–36 weeks´ gestation). A retrospective stratified study design was used to quantify different classes of sphingolipids in maternal plasma. We used a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) approach for determining different sphingolipid molecular species (sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), dihydro-sphingosine-1-phosphate (DH-S1P), sphingomyelins (SM) and ceramides (Cer)) in cross-gestational samples of human plasma from PE (n = 7, 21 plasma samples across pregnancy) and CTL (n = 7, 21 plasma samples across pregnancy) patients. Results Plasma levels of angiogenic S1P did not change significantly in control and in preeclamptic patients´ group across gestation. DH-S1P was significantly decreased in second trimester plasma of PE patients in comparison to their first trimester, which could contribute to reduced endothelial barrier observed in PE. The major ceramide species (Cer 16:0 and Cer 24:0) tended to be up-regulated in plasma of control and PE subjects across gestation. The levels of a less abundant plasma ceramide species (Cer 14:0) were significantly lower in first trimester plasma of PE patients when compared with their gestational-matched control samples (p = 0.009). Major plasma sphingomyelin species (SM 16:0, SM 18:1 and SM 24:0) tended to be higher in control pregnancies across gestation. However, in PE patients, SM 16:0, SM 18:0 and SM 18:1 showed significant up-regulation across gestation, pointing to atherogenic properties of the sphingomyelins and particularly the potential contribution of SM 18:0 to the disease development. In addition, two major sphingomyelins, SM 16:0 and SM 18:0, were significantly lower in first trimester plasma of PE patients versus first trimester samples of respective controls (p = 0.007 and p = 0.002, respectively). Conclusions Cross-gestational analysis of maternal plasma of preeclamptic and normotensive women identifies differences in the biochemical profile of major sphingolipids (DH-S1P, sphingomyelins and ceramides) between these two groups. In addition, first trimester maternal plasma sphingolipids (Cer 14:0, SM 16:0 and SM 18:0) may serve in the future as early biomarkers of PE occurrence and development."
https://openalex.org/W2605007673,"Postoperative atrial fibrillation, acute kidney dysfunction and low cardiac output following coronary surgery are associated with morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study is to determine if the preoperative autonomic control is a determinant of these postoperative complications. This is a prospective cohort study on 150 adult patients undergoing surgical coronary revascularization with cardiopulmonary bypass. The patients received an autonomic control assessment after the induction of anesthesia. Baroreflex sensitivity was computed by spectral analysis and expressed as BRSαHF and BRSαLF for measure respectively in the high and low frequency domains. Atrial fibrillation was adjudicated at any postoperative time during the hospital stay. Acute kidney dysfunction was defined as any increase of serum creatinine levels from preoperative values within the first 48 hours after surgery, and acute kidney injury was adjudicated at a 50% increase. Low cardiac ouput syndrome was defined as the need for inotropic support > 48 hours. Thirty-eight (26.4%) patients experienced postoperative atrial fibrillation; 32 (22.2%) had acute kidney dysfunction and 5 (3.5%) acute kidney injury; 14(10%) had a low cardiac output state. No indices of baroreflex sensitivity were associated with atrial fibrillation or acute kidney injury. A low value of BRSαLF was associated with acute kidney dysfunction and low cardiac output state. A BRSαLF < 3 msec/mmHg was an independent risk factor for acute kidney dysfunction (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.02-8.8, P = 0.045) and of low cardiac output state (odds ratio 17.0, 95% confidence interval 2.9-99, P = 0.002). Preoperative baroreflex sensitivity is linked to postoperative complications through a number of possible mechanisms, including an autonomic nervous system-mediated vasoconstriction, a poor response to hypotension, and an increased inflammatory reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2604627465,"Climate change produces extremes in both temperature and precipitation causing increased drought severity and increased reliance on groundwater resources. Agricultural practices, which rely on groundwater, are sensitive to but also sources of contaminants, including nitrate. How agricultural contamination drives groundwater geochemistry through microbial metabolism is poorly understood.On an active cow dairy in the Central Valley of California, we sampled groundwater from three wells at depths of 4.3 m (two wells) and 100 m (one well) below ground surface (bgs) as well as an effluent surface water lagoon that fertilizes surrounding corn fields. We analyzed the samples for concentrations of solutes, heavy metals, and USDA pathogenic bacteria of the Escherichia coli and Enterococcus groups as part of a long term groundwater monitoring study. Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing and assembly revealed taxonomic composition and metabolic potential of the community.Elevated nitrate and dissolved organic carbon occurred at 4.3m but not at 100m bgs. Metagenomics confirmed chemical observations and revealed several Planctomycete genomes, including a new Brocadiaceae lineage and a likely Planctomycetes OM190, as well novel diversity and high abundance of nano-prokaryotes from the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), the Diapherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota, Nanohaloarchaea (DPANN) and the Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, Korarchaeota (TACK) superphyla. Pathway analysis suggests community interactions based on complimentary primary metabolic pathways and abundant secondary metabolite operons encoding antimicrobials and quorum sensing systems.The metagenomes show strong resemblance to activated sludge communities from a nitrogen removal reactor at a wastewater treatment plant, suggesting that natural bioremediation occurs through microbial metabolism. Elevated nitrate and rich secondary metabolite biosynthetic capacity suggest incomplete remediation and the potential for novel pharmacologically active compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2604899089,"Follistatin (FST) is involved in hair follicle morphogenesis. However, its effects on hair traits are not clear. This study was designed to investigate the effects of FST gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on wool quality traits in Chinese Merino sheep (Junken Type). We performed gene expression analysis, SNP detection, and association analysis of FST gene with sheep wool quality traits. The real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that FST gene was differentially expressed in adult skin between Chinese Merino sheep (Junken Type) and Suffolk sheep. Immunostaining showed that FST was localized in inner root sheath (IRS) and matrix of hair follicle (HF) in both SF and Suffolk sheep. Sequencing analysis identified a total of seven SNPs (termed SNPs 1-7) in the FST gene in Chinese Merino sheep (Junken Type). Association analysis showed that SNP2 (Chr 16. 25,633,662 G>A) was significantly associated with average wool fiber diameter, wool fineness SD, and wool crimp (P < 0.05). SNP4 (Chr 16. 25,633,569 C>T) was significantly associated with wool fineness SD and CV of fiber diameter (P < 0.05). Similarly, the haplotypes derived from these seven identified SNPs were also significantly associated with average wool fiber diameter, wool fineness SD, CV of fiber diameter, and wool crimp (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that FST influences wool quality traits and its SNPs 2 and 4 might be useful markers for marker-assisted selection and sheep breeding."

A logistic analysis was performed to determine the independent predictive indicators of peritoneal metastasis. A prediction system that included the independent predictive indicators was constructed and evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curves, the ideal platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio cutoff value to predict peritoneal metastasis was 131.00. The logistic analysis showed that the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was an independent indicator to predict peritoneal metastasis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.599. When integrating all independent indicators (i.e., platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, invasion depth, lymphatic invasion, pathological type), the prediction system more reliably predicted peritoneal metastasis with a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.769). The preoperative platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was an indicator that could be used to predict peritoneal metastasis. Our prediction system could be a reliable instrument to discriminate between patients with gastric cancer with and those without peritoneal metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2604398855,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) as an acute-phase protein plays a crucial role in innate host response to bacterial challenge. Our previous study shows that LBP expression in human gingiva is associated with periodontal status. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone periodontopathogen, and its LPS with lipid A structural heterogeneity critically accounts for periodontal pathogenesis. This study investigated the effects of LBP and its interactions with two featured isoforms of P. gingivalis LPS (tetra-acylated LPS1435/1449 and penta-acylated LPS1690) on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human oral keratinocytes (HOKs), and the involvement of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. HOKs were pre-incubated with recombinant human LBP (rhLBP) at 10ng/ml, 100ng/ml and 1μg/ml for 1 h, followed by the treatment of P. gingivalis LPS1690 or LPS1435/1449 for 3h or 24h respectively. The expression of IL-6 and IL-8, and involvements of TLR2 and TLR4 were analyzed. The genes associated with TLR signaling were assessed by PCR array. Interestingly, rhLBP per se significantly up-regulated the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in HOKs (p<0.05), which was blocked by TLR2 antibody (p<0.001). LPS1435/1449 down-regulated more significantly rhLBP-induced IL-6 and IL-8 mRNAs with reference to P. gingivalis LPS1690 (approximately 80% vs. 40%, p<0.05; and 90% vs. 36%, p<0.001, respectively). Moreover, rhLBP markedly down-regulated the gene expression of TLRs and their adaptors such as CD180 (-2.44 folds) and MD-1 (-9.62 folds), while the interaction of P. gingivalis LPS1435/1449 with rhLBP greatly up-regulated both transcripts (7.11 and 4.05 folds, respectively). Notably, P. gingivalis LPS1690-rhLBP interaction dramatically up-regulated CD180 transcript (20.86 folds) and significantly down-regulated MD-1 transcript (-6.93 folds). This pioneering study shows that rhLBP enables to enhance the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in HOKs through TLR2 signaling pathway. P. gingivalis LPS with different lipid A structures down-regulates to different extents rhLBP-induced cytokine expression, possibly through fine-tuning of the CD180-MD1 complex and relevant TLRs."

To identify efficient indexes for evaluation of nutritional status and metabolic characteristics during different Child-Pugh stages of hepatitis B cirrhosis, 83 patients and 35 healthy individuals were enrolled in our study. We found that grip strength, triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), body fat and skeletal muscle of the patients were reduced compared to the control group (P<0.05). Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography data combined with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) showed that levels of a variety of metabolites, including lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs), glycerophosphocholine, ornithine and glucuronic acid were reduced in the serum of patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis (P<0.001). However, glycerophosphoserine and taurocholic acid levels were higher than in the control group (P<0.001). Moreover, grip strength was correlated with the Child-Pugh score (P<0.05). Serum albumin, total cholesterol, LDL, LysoPCs, glycerophosphocholine, ornithine, glucuronic acid, glycerophosphoserine and taurocholic acid were correlated with the Child-Pugh score (P<0.01). These findings suggested that grip strength and the above small molecular substances might be considered as sensitive and important indexes for evaluating nutritional status and metabolic characteristics of patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis, which may help assess prognosis and adjust nutritional treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2604927278,"Surgical resection is the main therapeutic option for intracranial meningiomas, but it is not without significant morbidities. The Surgical Apgar Score (SAS), assessed by intraoperative blood pressure, heart rate, and blood loss, was developed for prognostic prediction in general and vascular surgery. We aimed to examine whether the application of SAS in patients undergoing craniotomy for meningioma resection can predict postoperative major complications. We retrospectively enrolled 99 patients that had undergone intracranial meningioma surgery. The patients were subdivided into 2 groups based on whether major complications were present (N = 34) or not (N = 65). We recognized the intergroup differences in SAS and clinical variables. The incidence of 30-day major complications in patients after operation was 34.3%. The lengths of ICU and hospital stay for the morbid cases were prolonged significantly (p = 0.009, p < 0.001, respectively). In the multivariate logistic regression model, SAS was an independent predicting factor of major complications following surgery for intracranial meningiomas (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval = 0.57, 0.38-0.87; p = 0.009), and thus a decrease of one mean SAS increased the rate of major complications by 43%. In conclusions, SAS is an independent predictor of major complications in patients undergoing intracranial meningioma surgery, and provides acceptable risk discrimination. Since this scoring system is relatively simple, objective, and practical, we suggest that SAS be included as an indicator in the guidance for the level of care after craniotomy for meningioma resection."
https://openalex.org/W2605211622,"Current anti-fibrotic effect of antioxidants in vivo is disappointing due probably to the fact that once liver fibrogenesis is established it is too advanced to be reversed by anti-oxidation mechanism. We consider antioxidant may only act on the early phase of fibrogenesis. Thus, we had previously established an early liver fibrosis animal model using an inducible expression vector (pPK9a), which contains TGF-β gene and was hydro-dynamically transferred into mice to induce a transient liver fibrosis. TGF-β1 has been well documented to up-regulate the expression of α2(1) collagen (Col 1A2) gene in the liver via the reactive oxygen species (ROS); the process triggers inflammation, leading to hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation and liver fibrogenesis. Using our animal model and ROS, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and Col 1A2 promoter assays as screening targets, we report here that a maleic acid derivative isolated from the Antrodia camphorata mycelium strongly decreases ROS production, promoter activity of Cox-2 and Col 1A2, intracellular calcium, expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Smad4-p-Smad2/3 co-localization in cell nucleus and the DNA binding activity of Sp1. Our results suggest that the maleic acid derivative prevents liver fibrosis at an early phase both in vitro and in vivo through the inhibition of ROS, inflammation and the activation of HSC."
https://openalex.org/W2604502047,"Recycling endosomes are generally thought to play a central role in endocytic recycling, but recent evidence has indicated that they also participate in other cellular events, including cytokinesis, autophagy, and neurite outgrowth. Rab small GTPases are key regulators in membrane trafficking, and although several Rab isoforms, e.g., Rab11, have been shown to regulate recycling endosomal trafficking, the precise mechanism by which these Rabs regulate recycling endosomes is not fully understood. In this study, we focused on a Rab-GTPase-activating protein (Rab-GAP), one of the key regulators of Rabs, and comprehensively screened 43 mammalian Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC)/Rab-GAP-domain-containing proteins (TBC proteins) for proteins that specifically localize on recycling endosomes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Four of the 43 mammalian TBC proteins screened, i.e., TBC1D11, TBC1D12, TBC1D14, and EVI5, were found to colocalize well with transferrin receptor, a well-known recycling endosome marker. We further investigated the biochemical properties of TBC1D12, a previously uncharacterized TBC protein. The results showed that TBC1D12 interacted with active Rab11 through its middle region and that it did not display Rab11-GAP activity in vitro. The recycling endosomal localization of TBC1D12 was found to depend on the expression of Rab11. We also found that TBC1D12 expression had no effect on common Rab11-dependent cellular events, e.g., transferrin recycling, in MEFs and that it promoted neurite outgrowth, a specialized Rab11-dependent cellular event, of PC12 cells independently of its GAP activity. These findings indicated that TBC1D12 is a novel Rab11-binding protein that modulates neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2604159116,"Introduction Obesity is the principal component in the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) that determines the progression of metabolic complications. Metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals seem to be protected against those complications. Telomere length (TL) as a novel marker of cellular aging had a complex relationship to the MetS. The principal aim of this study was to investigate the TL in MHO, and to study the association between TL and the worsening of the metabolic condition. Material and methods We have determined the absolute TL (aTL) in 400 women (mean age of 46.76 ± 15.47 years; range: 18–86 years), grouped according to the metabolic condition in three groups: metabolically healthy non-obese women (MHNO), MHO and obese women with MetS (MSO); and grouped according to the number of components of MetS. Results We found that MHO displays significantly higher aTL than MSO (p = 0.033; r = -4.63; 95% CI r = -8.89 / -0.37), but did not differ from MHNO. A decrease in aTL with the progressive increase in the number of MetS components was also observed (p < 0.001; r = -2.06; 95% CI r = -3.13 / -0.99). In this way, our results indicate that aTL is influenced by the presence of MetS, but it is not affected by the presence of obesity. Discussion We found that shorter aTL is not associated with MHO, but is related to MetS and with the increased number of metabolic abnormalities."

Here, we undertake a topic analysis of dryland literature over the last 75 years (8218 articles) to identify areas in arid ecology that are well studied and topics that are emerging. Four topics—wetlands, mammal ecology, litter decomposition and spatial modelling, were identified as ‘hot topics’ that showed higher than average growth in publications from 1940 to 2015. Five topics—remote sensing, climate, habitat and spatial, agriculture and soils-microbes, were identified as ‘cold topics’, with lower than average growth over the survey period, but higher than average numbers of publications. Topics in arid ecology clustered into seven broad groups on word-based similarity. These groups ranged from mammal ecology and population genetics, broad-scale management and ecosystem modelling, plant ecology, agriculture and ecophysiology, to populations and paleoclimate. These patterns may reflect trends in the field of ecology more broadly. We also identified two broad research gaps in arid ecology: population genetics, and habitat and spatial research. Collaborations between population genetics and ecologists and investigations of ecological processes across spatial scales would contribute profitably to the advancement of arid ecology and to ecology more broadly."
https://openalex.org/W2605025080,"Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have spread globally and represent a serious and growing threat to public health. The introduction of rapid and sensitive methods for the detection of carbapenemase-producing bacteria is of increasing importance. The carbapenemase production can be detected using non-molecular methods (such as the modified Hodge test, the synergy test, the Carba NP test and the antibiotic hydrolysis assays) and DNA-based methods. In this study, we propose a modified version of a previously described meropenem hydrolysis assay (MHA) by MALDI-TOF MS for the phenotypic detection in 2h of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The MHA was successfully applied to detect carbapenemase activity in 981 well-characterized Enterobacteriaceae strains producing KPC or VIM carbapenemases, and in 146 carbapenem fully susceptible strains. This assay, applied also to NDM and OXA-48-producing strains and to CRE with resistance mechanisms other than carbapenemase production, has proved to be able to distinguish between carbapenemase-producing and -nonproducing Enterobacteriaceae. As already stated and as observed in our hands, MHA by MALDI-TOF MS analysis is independent from the type of carbapenemases involved, it is faster and easier to perform/interpret than culture-based methods. On the other hand, it cannot detect other carbapenem resistance mechanisms, such as porin alterations and efflux mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2604183056,"Sheath blight is one of the most devastating wheat diseases worldwide. Breeding resistant cultivars is the most powerful strategy to defeat the disease. Plant resistance on “disease escape” works through modulation of morphological traits and shows sustainable resistance to disease. Plant architectural traits have been reported to play a significant role in disease response. Therefore, exploring the genetic relationship between plant architecture and disease resistance is of importance to the understanding of plant resistance via “disease escape”. Using an F9 population of 266 RILs (Recombinant Inbred Lines) derived from the cross of Luke × AQ24788-83, we have generated a linkage map of 631 markers on 21 chromosomes. In this study, we present the QTL identification of fourteen plant architectural characteristics and heading time from two years and analyze their genetic relationships with seven previously published QTLs to sheath blight (QSBs, QSe.cau), including plant height (PH), the space between the flag leaf and penultimate leaf (fdR), heading date (Hd), and other traits. Twelve stable QTLs of the morphological traits were identified with good consistency across five replicates. For the seven previously published QSBs, we found no significant association with plant height. However, some of the QSBs displayed strong associations with plant architectural traits and heading date. Especially, QfdR.cau-1AS, QHd.cau-2BS, QfdR.cau-5DL, and QfdR.cau-6BL were respectively mapped to the same regions as QSe.cau-1AS, QSe.cau-2BS, QSe.cau-5DL, and QSe.cau-6BL. Taken together, we have demonstrated that plant height did not exert a direct influence on the resistance to sheath blight conferred by the seven QSBs and that the plant architecture and heading date did exhibit a tight relationship with the resistance. Therefore, this study provides a novel evidence to help understand sheath blight resistance in wheat. In addition, the linked morphological characteristics and the generated flanking markers will facilitate breeding for resistance to sheath blight in wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2582322369,"The extent to which you adapt your grammatical choices to match that of your interlocutor's (structural priming) can be influenced by the social opinion you have of your interlocutor. However, the direction and reliability of this effect is unclear as different studies have reported seemingly contradictory results. We have operationalized social perception as the ratings of strangeness for different avatars in a virtual reality study. The use of avatars ensured maximal control over the interlocutor's behaviour and a clear dimension along which to manipulate social perceptions toward this interlocutor. Our results suggest an inverted U-shaped curve in structural priming magnitude for passives as a function of strangeness: the participants showed the largest priming effects for the intermediately strange, with a decrease when interacting with the least- or most-strange avatars. The relationship between social perception and priming magnitude may thus be non-linear. There seems to be a 'happy medium' in strangeness, evoking the largest priming effect. We did not find a significant interaction of priming magnitude with any social perception."
https://openalex.org/W2604250351,"The reports of dual-targeted proteins in plants have steadily increased over the past years. The vast majority of these proteins are soluble proteins distributed between compartments of the non-secretory pathway, predominantly chloroplasts and mitochondria. In contrast, dual-targeted transmembrane proteins, especially of the secretory pathway, are rare and the mechanisms leading to their differential targeting remain largely unknown. Here, we report dual-targeting of the Arabidopsis DUF679 Membrane Protein 1 (DMP1) to the tonoplast (TP) and the plasma membrane (PM). In Arabidopsis and tobacco two equally abundant DMP1 isoforms are synthesized by alternative translation initiation: a full length protein, DMP1.1, and a truncated one, DMP1.2, which lacks the N-terminal 19 amino acids including a TP-targeting dileucine motif. Accumulation of DMP1.1 and DMP1.2 in the TP and the PM, respectively, is Brefeldin A-sensitive, indicating transit via the Golgi. However, DMP1.2 interacts with DMP1.1, leading to extensive rerouting of DMP1.2 to the TP and “eclipsed” localization of DMP1.2 in the PM where it is barely visible by confocal laser scanning microscopy but clearly detectable by membrane fractionation. It is demonstrated that eGFP fusion to either DMP1 terminus can cause mistargeting artifacts: C-terminal fusion to DMP1.1 or DMP1.2 results in altered ER export and N-terminal fusion to DMP1.1 causes mistargeting to the PM, presumably by masking of the TP targeting signal. These results illustrate how the interplay of alternative translation initiation, presence or absence of targeting information and rerouting due to protein-protein interaction determines the ultimate distribution of a transmembrane protein between two membranes."

Employing the proposed approach, three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of highly complex microscopic samples were achieved to facilitate the interpretation of topology and geometry of surface/shape attributes of the samples. As a byproduct of the proposed approach, high-definition 3D printed models of the samples can be generated as a tangible means of physical understanding. Extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art reveal the strength and superiority of the proposed method in uncovering the details of the highly complex microscopic samples."
https://openalex.org/W2605262425,"Studies focusing on neuropsychological impairments in Wilson’s disease (WD) have highlighted that patients showing neurological signs present significant deficits in a wide range of cognitive domains. Attentional and executive impairments have also been described in people with hepatic WD. However, social cognition abilities, i.e. cognitive processes required to perceive the emotions, intentions and dispositions of other people, have not been clearly investigated in WD. In this study we examined the social cognitive functioning in 19 patients with WD depending on their clinical status–Neurological versus Non-Neurological (“hepatic”) forms–compared to 20 healthy controls. For the very first time, results highlighted that patients with WD had significant impairments in the three major components of social cognition: emotion recognition, Theory of Mind and attributional style. However, these deficits differ depending on the form of the disease: patients with neurological signs showed a wide range of deficits in the three components that were assessed–results notably revealed impairments in recognizing “fear”, “anger”, and “disgust”, a significant Theory of Mind deficit and an “aggression bias”–whereas Non-Neurological patients only showed deficits on test assessing attributional bias, with a trend to react more “aggressively” to ambiguous social situations than healthy controls, as observed in Neurological WD patients, and a specific impairment in “anger” recognition. Our findings are discussed in the light of both neurocognitive impairments and brain damages, and especially those affecting the basal ganglia, as observed in people with WD."

Epidemiological data and blood samples were collected from 28 HTLV-1 infected subjects (index cases) and 92 close relatives/cohabitants. HTLV-1 infection was diagnosed by detection of antibodies and proviral DNA. The LTR region was sequenced and analyzed for genetic distances (VESPA software), in addition to determination and identification of polymorphisms to define HTLV-1 family signatures.Fifty seven of the 120 subjects enrolled had antibodies against HTLV-1 and were typified as HTLV-1 by PCR. The prevalence rate of HTLV-1 infection in family members of infected index cases was 31.52% (29/92). The infection was significantly associated with gender, age and prolonged lactation. Identity of LTR sequences and presence of polymorphisms revealed high prevalence of mother-to-child and interspousal transmission of HTLV-1 among these families.There is an ongoing and silent transmission of HTLV-1 through vertical and sexual routes within family clusters in Northwest Argentina.

Furthermore, the overall timeline of cartilage formation and the morphology of the cartilage in the pelvis are unclear. In this study, cartilage formation in the pelvic skeletons of 25 human fetuses (crown-rump length [CRL] = 11.9–75.0 mm) was observed using phase-contrast computed tomography and 7T magnetic resonance imaging. The chondrification center of the ilium, ischium, and pubis first appeared simultaneously at Carnegie stage (CS) 18, was located around the acetabulum, and grew radially in the later stage. The iliac crest formed at CS20 while the iliac body’s central part remained chondrified. The iliac body formed a discoid at CS22. The growth rate was greater in the ilium than in the sacrum-coccyx, pubis, and ischium. Connection and articulation formed in a limited period, while the sacroiliac joint formed at CS21. The articulation of the pubic symphysis, connection of the articular column in the sacrum, and Y-shape connection of the three parts of the hip bones to the acetabulum were observed at CS23; the connection of the ischium and pubic ramus was observed at the early-fetal stage. Furthermore, the degree of connection at the center of the sacrum varied among samples. Most of the pelvimetry data showed a high correlation with CRL. The transverse and antero-posterior lengths of the pelvic inlet of the lesser pelvis varied among samples (R2 = 0.11). The subpubic angle also varied (65–90°) and was not correlated with CRL (R2 = 0.22). Moreover, cartilaginous structure formation appeared to influence bone structure.

The fretting wear performance under different frequencies was performed by a MFT-6000 machine with a ball-on-plate configuration. The wear morphology was analyzed by white light interferometer, OM and SEM with an EDX. The result shows the Ti/TiN multi-layer film could greatly improve the fretting wear performance compared to the DU substrate. The fretting wear running and damaged behavior are strongly dependent on the film and test frequency. The fretting region of DU substrate and Ti/TiN multi-layer under low test frequency is gross slip.

https://openalex.org/W2604440467,"Background Aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the accuracy of respiration–correlated (4D) and uncorrelated (3D) cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in localizing lipiodolized hepatocellular carcinomas during stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Methods 4D–CBCT scans of eighteen HCCs were acquired during free–breathing SBRT following trans–arterial chemo–embolization (TACE) with lipiodol. Approximately 1320 x–ray projections per 4D–CBCT were collected and phase–sorted into ten bins. A 4D registration workflow was followed to register the reconstructed time–weighted average CBCT with the planning mid–ventilation (MidV) CT by an initial bone registration of the vertebrae and then tissue registration of the lipiodol. For comparison, projections of each 4D–CBCT were combined to synthesize 3D–CBCT without phase–sorting. Using the lipiodolized tumor, uncertainties of the treatment setup estimated from the absolute and relative lipiodol position to bone were analyzed separately for 4D– and 3D–CBCT. Results Qualitatively, 3D–CBCT showed better lipiodol contrast than 4D–CBCT primarily because of a tenfold increase of projections used for reconstruction. Motion artifact was observed to subside in 4D–CBCT compared to 3D–CBCT. Group mean, systematic and random errors estimated from 4D– and 3D–CBCT agreed to within 1 mm in the cranio–caudal (CC) and 0.5 mm in the anterior–posterior (AP) and left–right (LR) directions. Systematic and random errors are largest in the CC direction, amounting to 4.7 mm and 3.7 mm from 3D–CBCT and 5.6 mm and 3.8 mm from 4D–CBCT, respectively. Safety margin calculated from 3D–CBCT and 4D–CBCT differed by 2.1, 0.1 and 0.0 mm in the CC, AP, and LR directions. Conclusions 3D–CBCT is an adequate alternative to 4D–CBCT when lipoid is used for localizing HCC during free–breathing SBRT. Similar margins are anticipated with 3D– and 4D–CBCT."
https://openalex.org/W2604657606,"Previously, many different types of NTS barosensitive neurons were identified. However, the time course of NTS barosensitive neuronal activity (NA) in response to arterial pressure (AP) changes, and the relationship of NA-AP changes, have not yet been fully quantified. In this study, we made extracellular recordings of single NTS neurons firing in response to AP elevation induced by occlusion of the descending aorta in anesthetized rats. Our findings were that: 1) Thirty-five neurons (from 46 neurons) increased firing, whereas others neurons either decreased firing upon AP elevation, or were biphasic: first decreased firing upon AP elevation and then increased firing during AP decrease. 2) Fourteen neurons with excitatory responses were activated and rapidly increased their firing during the early phase of AP increase (early neurons); whereas 21 neurons did not increase firing until the mean arterial pressure changes (ΔMAP) reached near/after the peak (late neurons). 3) The early neurons had a significantly higher firing rate than late neurons during AP elevation at a similar rate. 4) Early neuron NA-ΔMAP relationship could be well fitted and characterized by the sigmoid logistic function with the maximal gain of 29.3. 5) The increase of early NA correlated linearly with the initial heart rate (HR) reduction. 6) The late neurons did not contribute to the initial HR reduction. However, the late NA could be well correlated with HR reduction during the late phase. Altogether, our study demonstrated that the NTS excitatory neurons could be grouped into early and late neurons based on their firing patterns. The early neurons could be characterized by the sigmoid logistic function, and different neurons may differently contribute to HR regulation. Importantly, the grouping and quantitative methods used in this study may provide a useful tool for future assessment of functional changes of early and late neurons in disease models."

In this study, a novel thioredoxin peroxidase (Bbt-TPx1), a member of the peroxiredoxin superfamily, was found by EST sequence analysis of a cDNA library of Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtaunese ovary. The sequence of a full-length cDNA clone contained an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 198 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular weight of 22,150 Da. The expression patterns of the protein at different developmental stages and adult amphioxus tissues indicate that this enzyme may play important roles in anti-oxidation and innate immunity. The recombinant Bbt-TPx1 protein was expressed with a polyhistidine-tag in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni chromatography followed by SP cation exchange chromatography. The rBbt-TPx1 protein existed as a dimer under non-reducing conditions, and was dissociated into monomers by dithiothreitol (DTT); it might predominantly exist in oligomeric form. The rBbt-TPx1 protein showed a significant thiol-dependent peroxidase activity, removing hydrogen peroxide in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT), but not glutathione (GSH).

The vessel mimic tube was placed inner glycerol phantom and it was filled with blood mimic substances. Blood-mimicked substances are prepared by adjusting the concentration of the glycerol solution to be similar to the acoustic properties of the blood, and vessel-mimicking materials are selected by measuring acoustic properties and thermal shrinkage of various materials in a heat-shrinkable tube. The blood vessels surrounding the tissue are replaced with the phantom similar to glycerol-based organization, and venous blood flow is implemented using a DC motor. The heating characteristics according to the ultrasonic wave using the manufactured varicose veins phantom were evaluated. As the sound wave irradiation time and power increased, the contractility of the vessel mimicking materials and the temperature of the surrounding tissues were increased. When the blood-mimicking material was circulated, the highest temperature in the focused region and the contractility of vessel mimicking materials were reduced under the same conditions as used for sonication. The manufactured phantom may contribute to the treatment of varicose veins and can be used to predict the ultrasonic therapeutic efficiency of varicose veins."
https://openalex.org/W2604347568,"Purpose Sunitinib drug eluting beads (DEB) are a novel anti-angiogenic bead preparation for use in transarterial chemoembolization. However, systematic studies of sunitinib DEB’s effect on cancer cells have not been reported. Herein, we assess their direct biologic efficacy against carcinoma cell lines and correlate cell viability with drug release in vitro. Materials and methods Sunitinib-HCl (10mg/mL) in Milli-Q water was mixed with LC Bead® 300–500μm (Biocompatibles UK Ltd.). Loading and release were assessed by measurement of drug UV absorbance using UV-visible spectrophotometer. Viability of human colorectal cancer (CRC, HCT116 and HT29) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, HepG2) cells upon exposure to sunitinib DEB was measured using a bioluminescent assay. Drug concentration during exposure was quantified using HPLC. Results When added to cultured HepG2 cells, sunitinib DEB rapidly inhibited viability with a significant decrease observed within 1 hour of incubation. Viability of HCT116 and HT29 cells decreased relatively slower, with significant reductions observed after 8 and 24 hours, respectively. After 24 hours there was nearly complete inhibition of all three cell lines. There was no difference in viability observed between cells treated with 5 μl, 10 μL, or 20 μL of sunitinib DEB. HPLC analysis of the cell culture supernatant demonstrated saturation of the cell medium within approximately 4 hours for each amount added, with sunitinib achieving a final concentration of 17.61 μM (SE ±1.01). Conclusions Sunitinib can be efficiently loaded to and released from LC beads, and the resulting sunitinib DEB demonstrate strong in vitro inhibition of human CRC and HCC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2604836271,"Gene expression is highly plastic, which can help organisms to both acclimate and adapt to changing environments. Possible variation in gene expression among individuals with the same genotype (among clones) is not widely considered, even though it could impact the results of studies that focus on gene expression phenotypes, for example studies using clonal lines. We examined the extent of within and between clone variation in gene expression in the earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra, which reproduces through apomictic parthenogenesis. Five microsatellite markers were developed and used to confirm that offspring are genetic clones of their parent. After that, expression of 12 genes was measured from five individuals each from six clonal lines after exposure to copper contaminated soil. Variation in gene expression was higher over all genotypes than within genotypes, as initially assumed. A subset of the genes was also examined in the offspring of exposed individuals in two of the clonal lines. In this case, variation in gene expression within genotypes was as high as that observed over all genotypes. One gene in particular (chymotrypsin inhibitor) also showed significant differences in the expression levels among genetically identical individuals. Gene expression can vary considerably, and the extent of variation may depend on the genotypes and genes studied. Ensuring a large sample, with many different genotypes, is critical in studies comparing gene expression phenotypes. Researchers should be especially cautious inferring gene expression phenotypes when using only a single clonal or inbred line, since the results might be specific to only certain genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2604239648,"The use of whole cell killed (WCK) oral cholera vaccines is an important strategy for cholera prevention in endemic areas. To overcome current vaccine limitations, we engineered strains of V. cholerae to be non-toxigenic and to express the protective protein colonization factor, toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), under scale-up conditions potentially amenable to vaccine production. Two V. cholerae clinical strains were selected and their cholera toxin genes deleted. The tcp operon was placed under control of a rhamnose-inducible promoter. Production and stability of TCP were assessed under various conditions. The strains lack detectable cholera toxin production. The addition of 0.1% rhamnose to the growth medium induced robust production of TCP and TcpA antigen. The strains produced intact TCP in larger growth volumes (1 L), and pili appeared stable during heat-killing or acid treatment of the bacterial cultures. To date, no WCK cholera vaccines have included TCP. We have constructed putative strains of V. cholerae for use in a vaccine that produce high levels of stable TCP antigen, which has not previously been achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2604671635,"Background Socioeconomic status and gender are associated with access to cardiac procedures and mortality after AMI, also in countries with universal health care systems. Our objective was to evaluate the association and trends of educational level or gender and the following outcomes: 1) access to PTCA; 2) 30-day mortality. Methods We conducted an observational study based on 14,013 subjects aged 35–74 years, residing in Rome in 2001, and hospitalised for incident STEMI within 2012 in the Lazio region. We estimated adjusted ORs of educational level or gender and: 1) PTCA within 2 days after hospitalisation, 2) 30-day mortality. We evaluated time trends of outcomes, and time trends of educational or gender differentials estimating ORs stratified by time period (two time periods between 2001 and 2012). We performed a hierarchical analysis to account for clustering of hospitals. Results Access to PTCA among patients with incident STEMI increased during the study period, while 30-day mortality was stable. We observed educational differentials in PTCA procedure only in the first time period, and gender differentials in both periods. Patterns for 30-day mortality were less marked, with educational differentials emerging only in the second period, and gender differentials only in the first one, with patients with low educational level and females being disadvantaged. Conclusions Educational differentials in the access to PTCA disappeared in Lazio region over time, coherently with scientific literature, while gender differentials seem to persist. It may be important to assess the role of female gender in patients with STEMI, both from a social and a clinical point of view."
https://openalex.org/W2604846786,"Two recent Phase III clinical trials to investigate an intravaginal ring for preventing HIV infection demonstrated that adherence to prescribed device use was a primary driver of efficacy. Surrogate methods for determining adherence in the studies were limited in their inability to monitor temporal patterns of use and allow deconvolution of the effects of adherence and device efficacy on HIV infection rates. To address this issue, we have developed functionality in an intravaginal ring to continuously monitor when the device is being used and maintain a log of adherence that can be accessed by clinicians after it is removed. An electronic module fabricated with common, inexpensive electronic components was encapsulated in a silicone intravaginal ring. The device uses temperature as a surrogate measure of periods of device insertion and removal, and stores a record of the data for subsequent retrieval. The adherence-monitoring intravaginal ring accurately recorded the device status over 33 simulated IN-OUT cycles and more than 1000 measurement cycles in vitro. Following initial in vitro testing in a temperature-controlled chamber, the device was evaluated in vivo in sheep using a predetermined insertion/removal pattern to simulate intravaginal ring use. After insertion into the vaginal cavity of a sheep, the logged data correctly indicated the device status over 29 hours of continuous measurement including three cycles of insertion and removal. The device described here is a promising, low-cost method for real-time adherence assessment in clinical trials involving medicated intravaginal rings or other intravaginal devices."
https://openalex.org/W2605087561,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between platelet indices [mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet count (PLT), platelet distribution width (PDW) and plateletcrit (PCT)] at diagnosis in osteosarcoma. Methods The information of 233 patients with osteosarcoma at diagnosis between 2007 and 2015 was retrospectively reviewed. Clinical parameters such as gender, age, size and site of tumor, and tumor necrosis rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed. Results No significant difference was noted in the mean values of MPV, PLT, PDW and PCT among stage I, II and III patients. In localized patients, the median disease-free survival (DFS) values were 42 and 22 months in the PLT<300×109/L and ≥300×109/L groups, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.2611). No difference in the DFS among the three different levels of MPV was observed. Conclusion No significantly different platelet indices were noted among the different stages. Although a shorter median DFS was found in localized patients with PLT≥300×109/L, there was still a lack of strong evidence to demonstrate the association between platelet indices and osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2604444929,"To prospectively evaluate the ability of CT urography with a low-dose multi-phasic excretory phase for opacification of the urinary system.Thirty-two patients underwent CT urography with low-dose multi-phasic s using adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D acquired at 5-, 10-, and 15-minute delays. Opacification scores of the upper urinary tracts and the urinary bladder were assigned for each excretory phase by two radiologists, who recorded whether adequate (>75%) or complete (100%) opacification of the upper urinary tract and urinary bladder was achieved in each patient. Adequate and complete opacification rates of the upper urinary tracts and the urinary bladder were compared among three excretory phases and among combined multi-phasic excretory phases using Cochran's Q test.There was no significant difference among three excretory phases with 5-, 10-, and 15-minute delays in adequate (56.3, 43.8, and 63.5%, respectively; P = 0.174) and complete opacification rates (9.3, 15.6, and 18.7%, respectively; P = 0.417) of the upper urinary tracts. Combined tri-phasic excretory phases significantly improved adequate and complete opacification rates to 84.4% and 43.8%, respectively (P = 0.002). In contrast, there were significant differences among three excretory phases for the rate of adequate (31.3, 84.4, and 93.8%, respectively; P<0.001) and complete opacification (21.9, 53.1, and 81.3%, respectively; P<0.001) of the urinary bladder. Multi-phasic excretory phases did not improve these rates because opacification was always better with a longer delay.Although multi-phasic acquisition of excretory phases is effective at improving opacification of the upper urinary tracts, complete opacification is difficult even with tri-phasic acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W3003244127,"Human beings are assumed to possess an approximate number system (ANS) dedicated to extracting and representing approximate numerical magnitude information. The ANS is assumed to be fundamental to arithmetic learning and has been shown to be associated with arithmetic performance. It is, however, still a matter of debate whether better arithmetic skills are reflected in the ANS. To address this issue, Chinese and German adults were compared regarding their performance in simple arithmetic tasks and in a non-symbolic numerical magnitude comparison task. Chinese participants showed a better performance in solving simple arithmetic tasks and faster reaction times in the non-symbolic numerical magnitude comparison task without making more errors than their German peers. These differences in performance could not be ascribed to differences in general cognitive abilities. Better arithmetic skills were thus found to be accompanied by a higher speed of retrieving non-symbolic numerical magnitude knowledge but not by a higher precision of non-symbolic numerical magnitude representations. The group difference in the speed of retrieving non-symbolic numerical magnitude knowledge was fully mediated by the performance in arithmetic tasks, suggesting that arithmetic skills shape non-symbolic numerical magnitude processing skills."
