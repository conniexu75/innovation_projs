https://openalex.org/W2790327509,"Growth signals, such as extracellular nutrients and growth factors, have substantial effects on genome integrity; however, the direct underlying link remains unclear. Here, we show that the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) pathway, a central regulator of growth signalling, phosphorylates RNF168 at Ser60 to inhibit its E3 ligase activity, accelerate its proteolysis and impair its function in the DNA damage response, leading to accumulated unrepaired DNA and genome instability. Moreover, loss of the tumour suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1; also known as STK11) hyperactivates mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-S6K signalling and decreases RNF168 expression, resulting in defects in the DNA damage response. Expression of a phospho-deficient RNF168-S60A mutant rescues the DNA damage repair defects and suppresses tumorigenesis caused by Lkb1 loss. These results reveal an important function of mTORC1-S6K signalling in the DNA damage response and suggest a general mechanism that connects cell growth signalling to genome stability control."
https://openalex.org/W2793068569,"The recent rise of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria represents a serious threat to public health and makes the search for novel effective alternatives to antibiotics a compelling need. Bacteriophage (Phage) lysins are enzymes that hydrolyze the cell wall of bacteria and represent a promising alternative to tackle this ever-increasing problem. Despite their use is believed to be restricted to Gram-positive bacteria, recent findings have shown that they can also be used against Gram-negative bacteria. By using a phage genome-based screening approach, we identified and characterized a novel lysin, PlyE146, encoded by an Escherichia coli prophage and with a predicted molecular mass of ca. 17 kDa. PlyE146 is composed of a C-terminal cationic peptide and a N-terminal N-acetylmuramidase domain. Histidine-tagged PlyE146 was overexpressed from a plasmid in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 and purified by NI-NTA chromatography. PlyE146 exhibited in vitro optimal bactericidal activity against E. coli K12 (3.6 log10 CFU/mL decrease) after 2 h of incubation at 37°C at a concentration of 400 μg/mL in the absence of NaCl and at pH 6.0. Under these conditions, PlyE146 displayed antimicrobial activity towards several other E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 to 3.8-log10 CFU/mL decrease) and Acinetobacter baumannii (4.9 to >5-log10 CFU/mL decrease) strains. Therefore, PlyE146 represents a promising therapeutic agent against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii infections. However, further studies are required to improve the efficacy of PlyE146 under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2786539699,"Based on genetic models with mutation or deletion of core clock genes, circadian disruption has been implicated in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders. Thus, we examined whether circadian desynchronization in response to shift work–type schedules is sufficient to compromise metabolic homeostasis and whether inflammatory mediators provide a key link in the mechanism by which alterations of circadian timekeeping contribute to diet-induced metabolic dysregulation. In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, exposure to chronic shifts of the light-dark cycle (12 h advance every 5 d): 1) disrupts photoentrainment of circadian behavior and modulates the period of spleen and macrophage clock gene rhythms; 2) potentiates HFD-induced adipose tissue infiltration and activation of proinflammatory M1 macrophages; 3) amplifies macrophage proinflammatory cytokine expression in adipose tissue and bone marrow–derived macrophages; and 4) exacerbates diet-induced increases in body weight, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in the absence of changes in total daily food intake. Thus, complete disruption of circadian rhythmicity or clock gene function as transcription factors is not requisite to the link between circadian and metabolic phenotypes. These findings suggest that macrophage proinflammatory activation and inflammatory signaling are key processes in the physiologic cascade by which dysregulation of circadian rhythmicity exacerbates diet-induced systemic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.—Kim, S.-M., Neuendorff, N., Alaniz, R. C., Sun, Y., Chapkin, R. S., Earnest, D. J. Shift work cycle-induced alterations of circadian rhythms potentiate the effects of high-fat diet on inflammation and metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2787291306,"BCL2-associated athanogene (BAG)-3 is viewed as a platform that would physically and functionally link distinct classes of molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein (HSP) family for the stabilization and clearance of damaged proteins. In this study, we show that HSPB8, a member of the small heat shock protein subfamily, cooperates with BAG3 to coordinate the sequestration of harmful proteins and the cellular adaptive response upon proteasome inhibition. Silencing of HSPB8, like depletion of BAG3, inhibited targeting of ubiquitinated proteins to the juxtanuclear aggresome, a mammalian system of spatial quality control. However, aggresome targeting was restored in BAG3-depleted cells by a mutant BAG3 defective in HSPB8 binding, uncoupling HSPB8 function from its binding to BAG3. Depletion of HSPB8 impaired formation of ubiquitinated microaggregates in an early phase and interfered with accurate modifications of the stress sensor p62/sequestosome (SQSTM)-1. This impairment correlated with decreased coupling of BAG3 to p62/SQSTM1 in response to stress, hindering Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (KEAP)-1 sequestration and stabilization of nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf)-2, an important arm of the antioxidant defense. Notably, the myopathy-associated mutation of BAG3 (P209L), which lies within the HSPB8-binding motif, deregulated the association between BAG3 and p62/SQSTM1 and the KEAP1-Nrf2 signaling axis. Together, our findings support a so-far-unrecognized role for the HSPB8-BAG3 connection in mounting of an efficient stress response, which may be involved in BAG3-related human diseases.—Guilbert, S. M., Lambert, H., Rodrigue, M.-A., Fuchs, M., Landry, J., Lavoie, J.

https://openalex.org/W2791339494,"Enzymatic hydrolysates of different food proteins demonstrate health benefits. Search for diet related food protein hydrolysates is therefore of interest within the scope of functional foods. Mungbean is one of the popular foods in India because of rich protein source. In this study, mungbean vicilin protein (MBVP) was enzymatically hydrolysed by alcalase and trypsin under optimal conditions. We have studied the antioxidant, antiproliferative and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activities of mungbean vicilin protein hydrolysate (MBVPH) vis-a-vis alcalase-generated mungbean vicilin protein hydrolysate (AMBVPH) and trypsin-generated mungbean vicilin protein hydrolysate (TMBVPH). The results showed that MBVPH exhibited higher antioxidant potential, ACE inhibitory and antiproliferative activities than MBVP. The alcalase treated hydrolysate displayed highest ACE inhibitory activity with IC50 value of 0.32 mg protein/ml. The MBVP showed significant antiproliferative activity against both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells at the doses between 0.2–1.0 mg/ml. The data suggested that MBVPH can be utilized as physiologically active functional foods with sufficient antihypertensive activity. The results indicate that mungbean can be utilized as a rich resource of functional foods."
https://openalex.org/W2785615957,"Golden retriever dogs have been reported to have an increased prevalence of cancer compared to other breeds. There is also controversy over the effect spay or neuter status might have on longevity and the risk for developing cancer. The electronic medical records system at an academic center was searched for all dogs who had a necropsy exam from 1989–2016. 9,677 canine necropsy examinations were completed of which 655 were golden retrievers. Age was known for 652 with a median age of death 9.15 years. 424 of the 652 (65.0%) were determined to have died because of cancer. The median age for dying of a cause other than cancer was 6.93 years while those dying of cancer had a median age of 9.83 years (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in the proportion of intact males and castrated males dying of cancer (p = 0.43) but a greater proportion of spayed females died of cancer compared to intact females (p = 0.001). Intact female dogs had shorter life spans than spayed female dogs (p<0.0001), but there were no differences between intact and castrated males. Intriguingly, being spayed or neutered did not affect the risk of a cancer related death but increasing age did. The most common histologic diagnosis found in golden retrievers dying of cancer was hemangiosarcoma (22.64%) followed by lymphoid neoplasia (18.40%). Overall golden retriever dogs have a substantial risk of cancer related mortality in a referral population and age appears to have a larger effect on cancer related mortality than reproductive status."

https://openalex.org/W2791300103,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules that play a significant role in many types of cancers including breast cancer. In the current study, we evaluated the expression levels of microR-10b (miR-10b) in 115 breast cancer patients from Sichuan Cancer Center. Real time reverse transcription-PCR was used to assess miR-10b expression. Clinical data including disease stage, survival status, age, ER/PR/HER2 status, molecular subtypes, tumor size, lymph node status and Ki-67 expression levels were correlated with miR-10b expression levels. Our data showed that the miR-10b expression is correlated with disease stage, living status and tumor sizes. We also found that miR-10b expression levels are higher in the lymph node positive group and the Ki-67 higher scoring group (score > 20). No statistically significant differences were observed based on age or molecular sub-type grouping. In conclusion, miR-10b may be a biomarker for breast cancer and is a potential treatment target."
https://openalex.org/W2793989158,"Nowadays there is increasing interest in identifying–and using–metabolites that can be employed as biomarkers for diagnosing, treating and monitoring diseases. Saliva and NMR have been widely used for this purpose as they are fast and inexpensive methods. This case-control study aimed to find biomarkers that could be related to glioblastoma (GBL) and periodontal disease (PD) and studied a possible association between GBL and periodontal status. The participants numbered 130, of whom 10 were diagnosed with GBL and were assigned to the cases group, while the remaining 120 did not present any pathology and were assigned to the control group. On one hand, significantly increased (p < 0.05) metabolites were found in GBL group: leucine, valine, isoleucine, propionate, alanine, acetate, ethanolamine and sucrose. Moreover, a good tendency to separation between the two groups was observed on the scatterplot of the NMR. On the other hand, the distribution of the groups attending to the periodontal status was very similar and we didn´t find any association between GBL and periodontal status (Chi-Square 0.1968, p = 0.91). Subsequently, the sample as a whole (130 individuals) was divided into three groups by periodontal status in order to identify biomarkers for PD. Group 1 was composed of periodontally healthy individuals, group 2 had gingivitis or early periodontitis and group 3 had moderate to advanced periodontitis. On comparing periodontal status, a significant increase (p < 0.05) in certain metabolites was observed. These findings along with previous reports suggest that these could be used as biomarkers of a PD: caproate, isocaproate+butyrate, isovalerate, isopropanol+methanol, 4 aminobutyrate, choline, sucrose, sucrose-glucose-lysine, lactate-proline, lactate and proline. The scatter plot showed a good tendency to wards separation between group 1 and 3."
https://openalex.org/W2790476146,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection has been associated with increased mortality, specifically cardiovascular disease (CVD), in high-income countries (HICs). There is a paucity of data in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where HCMV seropositivity is higher. Serum samples from 2,174 Ugandan individuals were investigated for HCMV antibodies and data linked to demographic information, co-infections and a variety of CVD measurements. HCMV seropositivity was 83% by one year of age, increasing to 95% by five years. Female sex, HIV positivity and active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were associated with an increase in HCMV IgG levels in adjusted analyses. There was no evidence of any associations with risk factors for CVD after adjusting for age and sex. HCMV infection is ubiquitous in this rural Ugandan cohort from a young age. The association between TB disease and high HCMV IgG levels merits further research. Known CVD risk factors do not appear to be associated with higher HCMV antibody levels in this Ugandan cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2791054014,"Background and objectives The impact of the newly proposed pathological classification by the Japan Renal Pathology Society (JRPS) on renal outcome is unclear. So we evaluated that impact and created a new pathological scoring to predict outcome using this classification. Design, setting, participants, & measurements A multicenter cohort of 493 biopsy-proven Japanese patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) were analyzed. The association between each pathological factor—Tervaert’ and JRPS classifications—and renal outcome (dialysis initiation or 50% eGFR decline) was estimated by adjusted Cox regression. The overall pathological risk score (J-score) was calculated, whereupon its predictive ability for 10-year risk of renal outcome was evaluated. Results The J-scores of diffuse lesion classes 2 or 3, GBM doubling class 3, presence of mesangiolysis, polar vasculosis, and arteriolar hyalinosis were, respectively, 1, 2, 4, 1, and 2. The scores of IFTA classes 1, 2, and 3 were, respectively, 3, 4, and 4, and those of interstitial inflammation classes 1, 2, and 3 were 5, 5, and 4 (J-score range, 0–19). Renal survival curves, when dividing into four J-score grades (0–5, 6–10, 11–15, and 16–19), were significantly different from each other (p<0.01, log-rank test). After adjusting clinical factors, the J-score was a significant predictor of renal outcome. Ability to predict 10-year renal outcome was improved when the J-score was added to the basic model: c-statistics from 0.661 to 0.685; category-free net reclassification improvement, 0.154 (-0.040, 0.349, p = 0.12); and integrated discrimination improvement, 0.015 (0.003, 0.028, p = 0.02). Conclusions Mesangiolysis, polar vasculosis, and doubling of GBM—features of the JRPS system—were significantly associated with renal outcome. Prediction of DN patients’ renal outcome was better with the J-score than without it."
https://openalex.org/W2790898138,"Background Soft tissue injuries commonly present to the emergency department (ED), often with acute pain. They cause significant suffering and morbidity if not adequately treated. Paracetamol and ibuprofen are commonly used analgesics, but it remains unknown if either one or the combination of both is superior for pain control. Objectives To investigate the analgesic effect of paracetamol, ibuprofen and the combination of both in the treatment of soft tissue injury in an ED, and the side effect profile of these drugs. Methods Double-blind, double dummy, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial. 782 adult patients presenting with soft tissue injury without obvious fractures attending the ED of a university hospital in the New Territories of Hong Kong were recruited. Patients were randomised using a random number table into three parallel arms of paracetamol only, ibuprofen only and a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen in a 1:1:1 ratio. The primary outcome measure was pain score at rest and on activity in the first 2 hours and first 3 days. Data was analysed on an intention to treat basis. Results There was no statistically significant difference in pain score in the initial two hours between the three groups, and no clinically significant difference in pain score in the first three days. Conclusion There was no difference in analgesic effects or side effects observed using oral paracetamol, ibuprofen or a combination of both in patients with mild to moderate pain after soft tissue injuries attending the ED. Trial registration The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (no. NCT00528658)."

https://openalex.org/W2792959183,"Among patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, 1-18% have an underlying diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and it is suspected that there is under-recognition of this disease. Our intention was to evaluate the specific features of PCD seen on computed tomography (CT) in the cohort of bronchiectasis in order to facilitate the diagnosis.One hundred and twenty-one CTs performed in patients with bronchiectasis were scored for the involvement, type, and lobar distribution of bronchiectasis, bronchial dilatation, and bronchial wall thickening. Later, associated findings such as mucus plugging, tree in bud, consolidations, ground glass opacities, interlobular thickening, intralobular lines, situs inversus, emphysema, mosaic attenuation, and atelectasis were registered. Patients with PCD (n = 46) were compared to patients with other underlying diseases (n = 75).In patients with PCD, the extent and severity of the bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickness were significantly lower in the upper lung lobes (p<0.001-p = 0.011). The lobar distribution differed significantly with a predominance in the middle and lower lobes in patients with PCD (<0.001). Significantly more common in patients with PCD were mucous plugging (p = 0.001), tree in bud (p <0.001), atelectasis (p = 0.009), and a history of resection of a middle or lower lobe (p = 0.047). Less common were emphysematous (p = 0.003) and fibrotic (p<0.001) changes. A situs inversus (Kartagener's Syndrome) was only seen in patients with PCD (17%, p <0.001).Typical imaging features in PCD include a predominance of bronchiectasis in the middle and lower lobes, severe tree in bud pattern, mucous plugging, and atelectasis. These findings may help practitioners to identify patients with bronchiectasis in whom further work-up for PCD is called for."

https://openalex.org/W2787818258,"Abnormal tau metabolism followed by formation of tau deposits causes a number of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies including Alzheimer’s disease. Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein precedes tau aggregation and is a topic of interest for the development of pharmacological interventions to prevent pathology progression at early stages. The development of a mathematical model of multisite phosphorylation of tau would be helpful for searching for the targets of pharmacological interventions and candidates for biomarkers of pathology progression. In the present study, we for the first time developed a model of multisite phosphorylation of tau protein and elucidated the relative contribution of kinases to phosphorylation of distinct sites. The model describes phosphorylation of tau or PKA-prephosphorylated tau by GSK3β and CDK5 and dephosphorylation by PP2A, accurately reproducing the data for short-term kinetics of tau (de)phosphorylation. Our results suggest that kinase inhibition may more specifically prevent tau hyperphosphorylation, e.g., on PHF sites, which are key biomarkers of pathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease. The main features of our model are partial phosphorylation of tau residues and merging of random and sequential mechanisms of multisite phosphorylation within the framework of the probability-based approach assuming independent phosphorylation events."
https://openalex.org/W2788646157,"Endocannabinoids (ECs) are involved in immunomodulation, neuroprotection and control of inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Activation of cannabinoid type 2 receptors (CB2) is known to diminish the release of pro-inflammatory factors and enhance the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) has been proved to induce the migration of eosinophils in a CB2 receptor-dependent manner in peripheral blood and activate neutrophils independent of CB activation in humans. The aim of the current study was to investigate the influence of the endocannabinoid system in two different CNS inflammatory diseases of the dog, i.e. Steroid-Responsive Meningitis-Arteritis (SRMA) and Intraspinal Spirocercosis (IS). The two main endocannabinoids, anandamide (AEA) and 2-AG, were quantified by mass spectrometry in CSF and serum samples of dogs affected with Steroid- Responsive Meningitis-Arteritis in the acute phase (SRMA A), SRMA under treatment with prednisolone (SRMA Tr), intraspinal Spirocercosis and healthy dogs. Moreover, expression of the CB2 receptor was evaluated in inflammatory lesions of SRMA and IS and compared to healthy controls using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Dogs with SRMA A showed significantly higher concentrations of total AG and AEA in serum in comparison to healthy controls and in CSF compared to SRMA Tr (p<0.05). Furthermore, dogs with IS displayed the highest ECs concentrations in CSF, being significantly higher than in CSF samples of dogs with SRMA A (p<0.05). CSF samples that demonstrated an eosinophilic pleocytosis had the highest levels of ECs, exceeding those with neutrophilic pleocytosis, suggesting that ECs have a major effect on migration of eosinophils in the CSF. Furthermore, CB2 receptor expression was found in glial cells in the spinal cord of healthy dogs, whereas in dogs with SRMA and IS, CB2 was strongly expressed not only in glial cells but also on the cellular surface of infiltrating leukocytes (i.e. neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages) at lesion sites. The present study revealed an upregulated endocannabinoid system in dogs with inflammatory CNS diseases, highlighting the endocannabinoid system as a potential target for treatment of inflammatory CNS diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2786184285,"Hypercapnia, elevated levels of CO2 in the blood, is a known marker for poor clinical prognosis and is associated with increased mortality in patients hospitalized with both bacterial and viral pneumonias. Although studies have established a connection between elevated CO2 levels and poor pneumonia outcomes, a mechanistic basis of this association has not yet been established. We previously reported that hypercapnia inhibits expression of key NF-κB-regulated, innate immune cytokines, TNF-α, and IL-6, in LPS-stimulated macrophages in vitro and in mice during Pseudomonas pneumonia. The transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is important in maintaining proteostasis during stress and has been shown to negatively regulate NF-κB activity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HSF1 activation in response to hypercapnia results in attenuated NF-κB-regulated gene expression. We found that hypercapnia induced the protein expression and nuclear accumulation of HSF1 in primary murine alveolar macrophages and in an alveolar macrophage cell line (MH-S). In MH-S cells treated with short interfering RNA targeting Hsf1, LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF-α release were elevated during exposure to hypercapnia. Pseudomonas-infected Hsf1+/+ (wild-type) mice, maintained in a hypercapnic environment, showed lower levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and IL-1β in lung tissue than did infected mice maintained in room air. In contrast, infected Hsf1+/- mice exposed to either hypercapnia or room air had similarly elevated levels of those cytokines. These results suggest that hypercapnia-mediated inhibition of NF-κB cytokine production is dependent on HSF1 expression and/or activation.-Lu, Z., Casalino-Matsuda, S.

https://openalex.org/W2794239655,"Visual experience during the critical period modulates visual development such that deprivation causes visual impairments while stimulation induces enhancements. This study aimed to determine whether visual stimulation in the form of daily optomotor response (OMR) testing during the mouse critical period (1) improves aspects of visual function, (2) involves retinal mechanisms and (3) is mediated by brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and dopamine (DA) signaling pathways. We tested spatial frequency thresholds in C57BL/6J mice daily from postnatal days 16 to 23 (P16 to P23) using OMR testing. Daily OMR-treated mice were compared to littermate controls that were placed in the OMR chamber without moving gratings. Contrast sensitivity thresholds, electroretinograms (ERGs), visual evoked potentials, and pattern ERGs were acquired at P21. To determine the role of BDNF signaling, a TrkB receptor antagonist (ANA-12) was systemically injected 2 hours prior to OMR testing in another cohort of mice. BDNF immunohistochemistry was performed on retina and brain sections. Retinal DA levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Daily OMR testing enhanced spatial frequency thresholds and contrast sensitivity compared to controls. OMR-treated mice also had improved rod-driven ERG oscillatory potential response times, greater BDNF immunoreactivity in the retinal ganglion cell layer, and increased retinal DA content compared to controls. VEPs and pattern ERGs were unchanged. Systemic delivery of ANA-12 attenuated OMR-induced visual enhancements. Daily OMR testing during the critical period leads to general visual function improvements accompanied by increased DA and BDNF in the retina, with this process being requisitely mediated by TrkB activation. These results suggest that novel combination therapies involving visual stimulation and using both behavioral and molecular approaches may benefit degenerative retinal diseases or amblyopia."
https://openalex.org/W2793006511,"Flow disruption achieved by braided intrasaccular implants is a novel treatment strategy for cerebrovascular aneurysms. We hypothesized that the degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption can be quantified in vitro and is influenced by device position across the aneurysm neck. We tested this hypothesis using the Medina® Embolization Device (MED).Ten different patient-specific elastic vascular models were manufactured. Models were connected to a pulsatile flow circuit, filled with a blood-mimicking fluid and treated by two operators using a single MED. Intra-aneurysmal flow velocity was measured using conventional and high-frequency digital subtraction angiography (HF-DSA) before and after each deployment. Aneurysm neck coverage by the implanted devices was assessed with flat detector computed tomography on a three-point Likert scale.A total of 80 individual MED deployments were performed by the two operators. The mean intra-aneurysmal flow velocity reduction after MED implantation was 33.6% (27.5-39.7%). No significant differences in neck coverage (p = 0.99) or flow disruption (p = 0.84) were observed between operators. The degree of flow disruption significantly correlated with neck coverage (ρ = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21-0.59, p = 0.002) as well as with neck area (ρ = -0,35, 95% CI: -0.54 --0.13, p = 0.024). On multiple regression analysis, both neck coverage and total neck area were independent predictors of flow disruption.The degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption after MED implantation can be quantified in vitro and varies considerably between different aneurysms and different device configurations. Optimal device coverage across the aneurysm neck improves flow disruption and may thus contribute to aneurysm occlusion."
https://openalex.org/W2794044581,"Historically, vaccine safety assessments have been conducted by animal testing (e.g., quality control tests and adjuvant development). However, classical evaluation methods do not provide sufficient information to make treatment decisions. We previously identified biomarker genes as novel safety markers. Here, we developed a practical safety assessment system used to evaluate the intramuscular, intraperitoneal, and nasal inoculation routes to provide robust and comprehensive safety data. Influenza vaccines were used as model vaccines. A toxicity reference vaccine (RE) and poly I:C-adjuvanted hemagglutinin split vaccine were used as toxicity controls, while a non-adjuvanted hemagglutinin split vaccine and AddaVax (squalene-based oil-in-water nano-emulsion with a formulation similar to MF59)-adjuvanted hemagglutinin split vaccine were used as safety controls. Body weight changes, number of white blood cells, and lung biomarker gene expression profiles were determined in mice. In addition, vaccines were inoculated into mice by three different administration routes. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to determine the expression changes of each biomarker. The results showed that the regression equations clearly classified each vaccine according to its toxic potential and inoculation amount by biomarker expression levels. Interestingly, lung biomarker expression was nearly equivalent for the various inoculation routes. The results of the present safety evaluation were confirmed by the approximation rate for the toxicity control. This method may contribute to toxicity evaluation such as quality control tests and adjuvant development."

The mechanisms initiating broodiness within the goose hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) are still unclear. Here, we reported the transcriptome differences between laying and initial nesting within the HPGA tissues of geese. We constructed a unigene database based on HPGA tissues and identified 128,148 unigenes, 100% of which have been annotated. By using Digital Gene Expression (DGE) sequencing, we screened 19, 110, 289, and 211 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, stroma ovarii, and follicles, respectively, between laying and nesting geese. Expression changes of hypocretin (HCRT) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the hypothalamus of nesting geese may cause appetite reduction, which is possibly the first step and a prerequisite to initiate broodiness. In addition to prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), genes including oxytocin-neurophysin (OXT), chordin-like protein 1 (CHRDL1) and growth hormone (GH), expressed in the pituitary gland, are new candidate molecules that may be involved in broodiness in geese. Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) in the pituitary gland, the proto-oncogene c-Fos (FOS), heat shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90AA), and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) in the ovary that may consolidate and transduce signals regulating the HPGA during broodiness in geese."
https://openalex.org/W2792357186,"Exposure measurement error represents one of the most important sources of uncertainty in epidemiology. When exposure uncertainty is not or only poorly accounted for, it can lead to biased risk estimates and a distortion of the shape of the exposure-response relationship. In occupational cohort studies, the time-dependent nature of exposure and changes in the method of exposure assessment may create complex error structures. When a method of group-level exposure assessment is used, individual worker practices and the imprecision of the instrument used to measure the average exposure for a group of workers may give rise to errors that are shared between workers, within workers or both. In contrast to unshared measurement error, the effects of shared errors remain largely unknown. Moreover, exposure uncertainty and magnitude of exposure are typically highest for the earliest years of exposure. We conduct a simulation study based on exposure data of the French cohort of uranium miners to compare the effects of shared and unshared exposure uncertainty on risk estimation and on the shape of the exposure-response curve in proportional hazards models. Our results indicate that uncertainty components shared within workers cause more bias in risk estimation and a more severe attenuation of the exposure-response relationship than unshared exposure uncertainty or exposure uncertainty shared between individuals. These findings underline the importance of careful characterisation and modeling of exposure uncertainty in observational studies."

In contrast to earlier findings from the field, we find no evidence that low-productivity workers perform better when they are observed by high-productivity co-workers. Instead, our results imply that peer effects in our experiment are heterogeneous, with some workers reciprocating a high-productivity co-worker but others taking the opportunity to free ride."

A draft genome sequence was prepared for this organism. A total of 177,847 reads were assembled into 75 contigs > 518 bp with a total base value of 652,092 and an overall [G+C] content of 27.1%. A total of 733 protein coding genes were identified. This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession MAPF00000000. This draft genome was used for genome- and gene-based comparative phylogenetic analyses with other phytoplasmas, including the closely related ‘Ca. Phytoplasma asteris’ strain, aster yellows witches’- broom (AY-WB). NJAY and AY-WB exhibit approximately 0.5% dissimilarity at the nucleotide level among their shared genomic segments. Evidence indicated that NJAY harbors four plasmids homologous to those known to encode pathogenicity determinants in AY-WB, as well as a chromosome-encoded mobile unit. Apparent NJAY orthologs to the important AY-WB virulence factors, SAP11 and SAP54, were identified. A number of secreted proteins, both membrane-bound and soluble, were encoded, with many bearing similarity to known AY-WB effector molecules and others representing possible secreted proteins that may be novel to the NJAY lineage."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the phenotypic correlation among morphological characteristics of cacao progenies submitted to irrigation and drought conditions and their partitions into direct and indirect effects. Path analysis with phenotypic plasticity index was used as criteria for estimation of basic and explanatory variables. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at the Cacao Research Center (CEPEC), Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil, in a randomized block 21 x 2 factorial arrangement [21 cacao progenies obtained from complete diallel crosses and two water regimes (control and drought)] and six replications. In general, drought conditions influenced biomass production in most progenies, causing significant reductions in total leaf area, leaf number, leaf biomass, fine-roots length (diameter <1 mm), root volume and root area for considered drought intolerant. All progenies showed alterations in growth due to drought. Phenotypic plasticity was most strongly pronounced in root volume. Stem and root diameters, as well as stem dry biomass were the growth variables with the greatest direct effects on root volume under drought conditions, these characters being indicated in screening of cacao progenies drought tolerant."
https://openalex.org/W2786071990,"The structures of non-human antibodies are largely unstudied despite the potential for the identification of alternative structural motifs and physical properties that will benefit a basic understanding of protein and immune system evolution as well as highlight unexplored motifs to improve therapeutic monoclonal antibody. Here we probe the structure and receptor-binding properties of the mouse IgG2c crystallizable fragment (Fc) to compare to mouse IgG2b and human IgG1 Fcs. Models of mIgG2c Fc determined by x-ray crystallography with a complex-type biantennary (to 2.05 Å) or a truncated (1)GlcNAc asparagine-linked (N)-glycan attached (to 2.04 Å) show differences in key regions related to mouse Fc γ receptor IV (mFcγRIV) binding. Mouse IgG2c forms different non-bonded interactions between the BC, DE and FG loops than the highly-conserved mIgG2b and binds to FcγRIV with 4.7-fold greater affinity in the complex-type glycoform. Secondary structural elements surrounding the Asn297 site of glycosylation form longer beta strands in the truncated mIgG2c Fc glycoform when compared to mIgG2c with the complex-type N-glycan. Solution NMR spectroscopy of the N-linked (1)GlcNAc residues show differences between mIgG2b, 2c and hIgG1 Fc that correlate to receptor binding affinity. Mutations targeting differences in mIgG2 DE and FG loops decreased affinity of mIgG2c for FcγRIV and increased affinity of mIgG2b. Changes in NMR spectra of the mutant Fc proteins mirrored these changes in affinity. Our studies identified structural and functional differences in highly conserved molecules that were not predicted from primary sequence comparison."

https://openalex.org/W2790713886,"Five different species of selected broad-spectrum antibiotic lactic acid bacteria isolated from extremely high-cold areas were used as starters to ferment indigenous forage oats and wheatgrass under rigid alpine climatic conditions. The five isolates were Lactobacillus plantarum QZ227, Enterococcus mundtii QZ251, Pediococcus cellicola QZ311, Leuconostoc mesenteroides QZ1137 and Lactococcus lactis QZ613, and commercial Lactobacillus plantarum FG1 was used as the positive control and sterile water as the negative control. The minimum and maximum temperatures were -22°C and 23°C during the fermentation process, respectively. The pH of wheatgrass silage fermented by the QZ227 and FG1 inocula reached the expected values (≤4.15) although the pathogens detected in the silage should be further investigated. All of the inocula additives used in this study were effective in improving the fermentation quality of oat silage as indicated by the higher content of lactic acid, lower pH values (≤4.17) and significant inhibition of pathogens. QZ227 exhibited a fermentation ability that was comparable with the commercial inoculum FG1 for the whole process, and the deterioration rate was significantly lower than for FG1 after storage for 7 months. The pathogens Escherichia coli, mold and yeast were counted and isolated from the deteriorated silage. E. coli were the main NH3-N producer while F. fungi and yeast produced very little."
https://openalex.org/W2788609296,"The activity-induced transcription factor ∆FosB has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as a critical regulator of hippocampal function and cognition downstream of seizures and network hyperexcitability. With its long half-life (> 1 week), ∆FosB is well-poised to modulate hippocampal gene expression over extended periods of time, enabling effects to persist even during seizure-free periods. However, the transcriptional mechanisms by which ∆FosB regulates hippocampal function are poorly understood due to lack of identified hippocampal gene targets. To identify putative ∆FosB gene targets, we employed high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA bound to ∆FosB after chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-sequencing). We compared ChIP-sequencing results from hippocampi of transgenic mice expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and nontransgenic (NTG) wild-type littermates. Surprisingly, only 52 ∆FosB gene targets were shared between NTG and APP mice; the vast majority of targets were unique to one genotype or the other. We also found a functional shift in the repertoire of ∆FosB gene targets between NTG and APP mice. A large number of targets in NTG mice are involved in neurodevelopment and/or cell morphogenesis, whereas in APP mice there is an enrichment of targets involved in regulation of membrane potential and neuronal excitability. RNA-sequencing and quantitative PCR experiments confirmed that expression of putative ∆FosB gene targets were altered in the hippocampus of APP mice. This study provides key insights into functional domains regulated by ∆FosB in the hippocampus, emphasizing remarkably different programs of gene regulation under physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2794070496,"Introduction Shared traumatic reality occurs when therapists are doubly exposed to a traumatic event, both through their clients’ experience, along with their own direct exposure. Studies have shown that a shared traumatic reality can lead to both positive and negative outcomes for therapists. Most studies have examined these reactions sometime after the end of the traumatic event, and less is known about reactions that occur during a traumatic event. In addition, most studies have assumed, rather than examined, indirect exposure. In this study, we extend this literature by examining direct and indirect exposure of therapists during a war situation, and their psychological reactions. Method Over a period of two months in 2014, 70% of the Israeli population was exposed to rocket fire. Geographical areas differed in terms of amount of exposure, and its potential danger. 151 therapists living throughout Israel were assessed via an Internet based survey in the middle of the war, and were assessed for the effects on their professional and personal lives, degree of burnout, ways of coping and symptoms levels of PTSD and psychological distress. Results These indicate that significant differences in direct exposure occurred depending on place of residence. PTSD levels were related to higher direct exposure, as well as prior trauma exposure, but not to indirect exposure. Indirect exposure, as measured by increased workload, was related to increased distress and emotional exhaustion. Discussion These data shed light on the effects of direct and indirect exposure to a shared traumatic experience of war amongst therapists. The data support previous studies showing a greater effect of direct exposure on PTSD. Since indirect exposure appears to negatively impact burnout and psychological distress, rather than PTSD, this study shows that symptoms other than PTSD should be the result of in a shared traumatic reality."
https://openalex.org/W2789942659,"Pre-construction assessments of bird collision risk at proposed wind farms are often confounded by insufficient or poor quality data describing avian flight paths through the development area. These limitations can compromise the practical value of wind farm impact studies. We used radar- and observer-based methods to quantify great white pelican flights in the vicinity of a planned wind farm on the Cape west coast, South Africa, and modelled turbine collision risk under various scenarios. Model outputs were combined with pre-existing demographic data to evaluate the possible influence of the wind farm on the pelican population, and to examine impact mitigation options. We recorded high volumes of great white pelican movement through the wind farm area, coincident with the breeding cycle of the nearby colony and associated with flights to feeding areas located about 50 km away. Pelicans were exposed to collision risk at a mean rate of 2.02 High Risk flights.h-1. Risk was confined to daylight hours, highest during the middle of the day and in conditions of strong north-westerly winds, and 82% of High Risk flights were focused on only five of the proposed 35 turbine placements. Predicted mean mortality rates (22 fatalities.yr-1, 95% Cl, 16–29, with average bird and blade speeds and 95% avoidance rates) were not sustainable, resulting in a negative population growth rate (λ = 0.991). Models suggested that removal of the five highest risk turbines from the project, or institution of a curtailment regimen that shuts down at least these turbines at peak traffic times, could theoretically reduce impacts to manageable levels. However, in spite of the large quantities of high quality data used in our analyses, our collision risk model remains compromised by untested assumptions about pelican avoidance rates and uncertainties about the existing dynamics of the pelican population, and our findings are probably not reliable enough to ensure sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W2792944408,"Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging is a powerful tool for the assessment of bone quality; however, it requires the preparation of thin bone sections. Conventional poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) embedding for the preparation of sections takes more than two weeks and causes denaturation of the bone. Development of a quick and easy sample preparation technique without denaturation is needed for accurate clinical evaluation of fresh calcified bone using FTIR imaging. Frozen sectioning allows the quick and easy preparation of thin sections without denaturation, but it requires a substrate with good chemical resistance and improved heat shock resistance. Polypropylene (PP) film afforded both good chemical resistance and greater heat shock resistance, and the 4-μm-thick PP film coated with glue was thin enough for the IR beam to pass through it, while the optical anisotropy of infrared bands overlapping with PO43- band was negligible. The bone quality of femoral thin sections prepared by the conventional PMMA embedding and sectioning procedure (RESIN-S) or the newly developed frozen sectioning procedure (FROZEN-S) was evaluated by FTIR imaging. The mineral-to-matrix ratio and crystallinity in the RESIN-S sections were higher than those in the FROZEN-S sections, whereas the carbonate-to-phosphate ratio in the RESIN-S sections was lower than that in the FROZEN-S sections. In RESIN-S, the increased mineral-to-matrix ratio could be caused by dehydration, and the increased crystallinity and decreased carbonate-to-phosphate ratio might be consequence of dissolution of bone mineral during PMMA embedding. Therefore, the combined use of PP film coated with glue and the frozen sectioning procedure without denaturation appears well suited to the assessment of the bone quality of fresh calcified bone using FTIR imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2791759015,"Background Data on the outcomes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with biventricular obstruction are limited. Objective Our aim is to compare mid-term outcomes of biventricular outflow tract obstruction (BVOTO) HCM, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) HCM and nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (NO-HCM) in children and adolescents who were treated with standard medication or surgical resection. Methods This retrospective study identified 21 BVOTO patients and recruited 27 LVOTO and 24 NO-HCM patients younger than 18 years presenting at our institution. The primary endpoint was all-cause death, and secondary endpoints were cardiovascular events. Results More BVOTO patients (61.9%) than LVOTO (19.2%) and NO-HCM patients (25%) exhibited New York Heart Association (NYHA) III/IV status (p < 0.01). Fourteen BVOTO and 16 LVOTO patients obtained a significant reduction of outflow tract pressure gradients after surgery (vs. preoperative baseline, p < 0.001). One of the 14 BVOTO patients died, whereas no deaths occurred among LVOTO patients. Three of 14 BVOTO surgery patients had complete heart block (CHB) and 4 had new right bundle branch block (RBBB), while no CHB or RBBB occurred in the LVOTO surgery patients. The BVOTO patients had a longer duration of aortic cross-clamping and postoperative hospital days than the LVOTO patients (p < 0.05). During a median 42-month follow-up, no deaths occurred among the remaining patients. The primary and secondary endpoint-free survival rates of the BVOTO group were comparable to those of the LVOTO and NO-HCM groups. Conclusions In children and adolescents, BVOTO patients were associated with more severe symptoms than LVOTO and NO-HCM patients; however, good mid-term outcomes similar to those of the LVOTO and NO-HCM groups can be achieved with the application of contemporary cardiovascular treatment strategies. Notably, BVOTO surgery was associated with an increased risk of CHB and RBBB compared to LVOTO surgery."

Several reports unable to show beta cell volume augmentation in PDL pancreas used automated digital image analysis software. We hypothesized that fully automatic beta cell morphometry without manual micrograph artifact remediation introduces bias and therefore might be responsible for reported discrepancies and controversy. However, our present results prove that standard digital image processing with automatic thresholding is sufficiently robust albeit less sensitive and less adequate to demonstrate a significant increase in beta cell volume in PDL versus Sham-operated pancreas. We therefore conclude that other confounding factors such as quality of surgery, selection of samples based on relative abundance of the transcription factor Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) and tissue processing give rise to inter-laboratory inconsistencies in beta cell volume quantification in PDL pancreas."

https://openalex.org/W2789720401,"Ovomermis sinensis is a potentially-valuable nematode for controlling insect pests. The parasitic stage of the nematode absorbs nutrients in its host's hemolymph to maintain its growth development and then kills the host when it emerges. At present, little known about its reproductive development, particularly the responsible molecular mechanism. More detailed research on the genes of reproductive development will not only help us understand the mechanisms underlying sex differentiation in the nematode, but would also be valuable for successfully cultivating them in vitro and using them for biocontrol. In this study, we used the homology cloning method to clone the full-length cDNA of a DEAD-box family gene (Oslaf-1) from O. sinensis. Then, using qRT-PCR technology to detect the expression pattern of the Oslaf-1 gene at different development stages and tissues, the gene was found to be highly expressed in the post-parasitic stage (P < 0.01) and ovarian (P < 0.05) of O. sinensis. Western blot analysis showed the same result that the gene is associated with gonadal development and function, but is not gonad-specific. In situ hybridization further demonstrated that the gene is widely expressed in early embryos and is mainly distributed in the gonadal area. However, the signal was mainly concentrated in the reproductive primordia in pre-parasitic juveniles. RNA interference (RNAi) studies revealed that the sex ratio of O. sinensis soaked in dsRNA of Oslaf-1 was not statistically different than the gfp dsRNA treated groups. Our results suggest that Oslaf-1 may play a vital role in the reproductive systems of the nematode. In addition, we speculate that the Oslaf-1 gene plays an important role during embryonic development and that it occurs and develops in the gonads of pre-parasitic juveniles of O. sinensis."
