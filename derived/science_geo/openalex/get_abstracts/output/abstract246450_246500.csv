https://openalex.org/W1972336737,"Apoptosis and autophagy are both tightly regulated biological processes that play a central role in tissue homeostasis, development, and disease. The anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, interacts with the evolutionarily conserved autophagy protein, Beclin 1. However, little is known about the functional significance of this interaction. Here, we show that wild-type Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins, but not Beclin 1 binding defective mutants of Bcl-2, inhibit Beclin 1-dependent autophagy in yeast and mammalian cells and that cardiac Bcl-2 transgenic expression inhibits autophagy in mouse heart muscle. Furthermore, Beclin 1 mutants that cannot bind to Bcl-2 induce more autophagy than wild-type Beclin 1 and, unlike wild-type Beclin 1, promote cell death. Thus, Bcl-2 not only functions as an antiapoptotic protein, but also as an antiautophagy protein via its inhibitory interaction with Beclin 1. This antiautophagy function of Bcl-2 may help maintain autophagy at levels that are compatible with cell survival, rather than cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2093579074,"Antiviral immunity against a pathogen is mounted upon recognition by the host of virally associated structures. One of these viral ‘signatures’, double-stranded (ds) RNA, is a replication product of most viruses within infected cells and is sensed by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and the recently identified cytosolic RNA helicases RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I, also known as Ddx58) and Mda5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, also known as Ifih1 or Helicard)1. Both helicases detect dsRNA, and through their protein-interacting CARD domains, relay an undefined signal resulting in the activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB. Here we describe Cardif, a new CARD-containing adaptor protein that interacts with RIG-I and recruits IKKα, IKKβ and IKKɛ kinases by means of its C-terminal region, leading to the activation of NF-κB and IRF3. Overexpression of Cardif results in interferon-β and NF-κB promoter activation, and knockdown of Cardif by short interfering RNA inhibits RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses. Cardif is targeted and inactivated by NS3-4A, a serine protease from hepatitis C virus known to block interferon-β production. Cardif thus functions as an adaptor, linking the cytoplasmic dsRNA receptor RIG-I to the initiation of antiviral programmes."

Here we synthesize field data from arctic Alaska, showing that terrestrial changes in summer albedo contribute substantially to recent high-latitude warming trends. Pronounced terrestrial summer warming in arctic Alaska correlates with a lengthening of the snow-free season that has increased atmospheric heating locally by about 3 watts per square meter per decade (similar in magnitude to the regional heating expected over multiple decades from a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 ). The continuation of current trends in shrub and tree expansion could further amplify this atmospheric heating by two to seven times."

https://openalex.org/W2012257160,"All animals coordinate growth and maturation to reach their final size and shape. In insects, insulin family molecules control growth and metabolism, whereas pulses of the steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) initiate major developmental transitions. We show that 20E signaling also negatively controls animal growth rates by impeding general insulin signaling involving localization of the transcription factor dFOXO and transcription of the translation inhibitor 4E-BP . We also demonstrate that the larval fat body, equivalent to the vertebrate liver, is a key relay element for ecdysone-dependent growth inhibition. Hence, ecdysone counteracts the growth-promoting action of insulins, thus forming a humoral regulatory loop that determines organismal size."
https://openalex.org/W2133553247,"Cyclic adenosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate (cAMP) is a ubiquitous mediator of intracellular signalling events. It acts principally through stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKAs)1,2 but also activates certain ion channels and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Epacs)3. Metabolism of cAMP is catalysed by phosphodiesterases (PDEs)4,5. Here we identify a cAMP-responsive signalling complex maintained by the muscle-specific A-kinase anchoring protein (mAKAP) that includes PKA, PDE4D3 and Epac1. These intermolecular interactions facilitate the dissemination of distinct cAMP signals through each effector protein. Anchored PKA stimulates PDE4D3 to reduce local cAMP concentrations, whereas an mAKAP-associated ERK5 kinase module suppresses PDE4D3. PDE4D3 also functions as an adaptor protein that recruits Epac1, an exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1, to enable cAMP-dependent attenuation of ERK5. Pharmacological and molecular manipulations of the mAKAP complex show that anchored ERK5 can induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Thus, two coupled cAMP-dependent feedback loops are coordinated within the context of the mAKAP complex, suggesting that local control of cAMP signalling by AKAP proteins is more intricate than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2066655294,"Although in principle transition metals can form bonds with six shared electron pairs, only quadruply bonded compounds can be isolated as stable species at room temperature. Here we show that the reduction of {Cr(μ-Cl)Ar′} 2 [where Ar′ indicates C 6 H 3 -2,6(C 6 H 3 -2,6-Pr i 2 ) 2 and Pr indicates isopropyl] with a slight excess of potassium graphite has produced a stable compound with fivefold chromium-chromium (Cr–Cr) bonding. The very air- and moisture-sensitive dark red crystals of Ar′CrCrAr′ were isolated with greater than 40% yield. X-ray diffraction revealed a Cr–Cr bond length of 1.8351(4) angstroms (where the number in parentheses indicates the standard deviation) and a planar transbent core geometry. These data, the structure's temperature-independent paramagnetism, and computational studies support the sharing of five electron pairs in five bonding molecular orbitals between two 3d 5 chromium(I) ions."
https://openalex.org/W2091933198,"The mammalian complement system is a phylogenetically ancient cascade system that has a major role in innate and adaptive immunity. Activation of component C3 (1,641 residues) is central to the three complement pathways and results in inflammation and elimination of self and non-self targets. Here we present crystal structures of native C3 and its final major proteolytic fragment C3c. The structures reveal thirteen domains, nine of which were unpredicted, and suggest that the proteins of the alpha2-macroglobulin family evolved from a core of eight homologous domains. A double mechanism prevents hydrolysis of the thioester group, essential for covalent attachment of activated C3 to target surfaces. Marked conformational changes in the alpha-chain, including movement of a critical interaction site through a ring formed by the domains of the beta-chain, indicate an unprecedented, conformation-dependent mechanism of activation, regulation and biological function of C3."
https://openalex.org/W2071379072,"The assumption that nitrogen enrichment caused by human activities is threatening biodiversity in Europe and North America may be false. A survey of herbaceous terrestrial ecosystems covering a gradient of decreasing nitrogen deposition from Western Europe to Siberia suggests that phosphorus, not nitrogen, is often the key element. In the 274 sites examined, many more endangered plant species persist under phosphorus-limited than nitrogen-limited conditions, so extra phosphorus is the more likely to cause species loss. Conservation policies biased towards reducing nitrogen enrichment are unlikely to succeed; rather, attention should focus on reducing phosphorus availability. On the cover, Great Vasyugan in Western Siberia, a peatland harbouring many plant species under P-limited conditions, some of which are shown on the cover. Main image: Wladimir Bleuten; inserts: Franziska Tanneberger. Nitrogen enrichment is widely thought to be responsible for the loss of plant species from temperate terrestrial ecosystems. This view is based on field surveys and controlled experiments showing that species richness correlates negatively with high productivity1,2 and nitrogen enrichment3. However, as the type of nutrient limitation has never been examined on a large geographical scale the causality of these relationships is uncertain. We investigated species richness in herbaceous terrestrial ecosystems, sampled along a transect through temperate Eurasia that represented a gradient of declining levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition—from ∼ 50 kg ha-1 yr-1 in western Europe to natural background values of less than 5 kg ha-1 yr-1 in Siberia4. Here we show that many more endangered plant species persist under phosphorus-limited than under nitrogen-limited conditions, and we conclude that enhanced phosphorus is more likely to be the cause of species loss than nitrogen enrichment. Our results highlight the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms of phosphorus enrichment, and for a stronger focus on conservation management to reduce phosphorus availability."

https://openalex.org/W2125685908,"Retinoic acid (RA) induces proliferation arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, and defects in retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling have been implicated in cancer. The human tumor antigen PRAME is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, but its function has remained unclear. We identify here PRAME as a dominant repressor of RAR signaling. PRAME binds to RAR in the presence of RA, preventing ligand-induced receptor activation and target gene transcription through recruitment of Polycomb proteins. PRAME is present at RAR target promoters and inhibits RA-induced differentiation, growth arrest, and apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of PRAME expression by RNA interference in RA-resistant human melanoma restores RAR signaling and reinstates sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of RA in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that overexpression of PRAME frequently observed in human cancers confers growth or survival advantages by antagonizing RAR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2098624952,"In response to binding viral double-stranded RNA byproducts within a cell, the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR phosphorylates the α subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2 on a regulatory site, Ser51. This triggers the general shutdown of protein synthesis and inhibition of viral propagation. To understand the basis for substrate recognition by and the regulation of PKR, we determined X-ray crystal structures of the catalytic domain of PKR in complex with eIF2α. The structures reveal that eIF2α binds to the C-terminal catalytic lobe while catalytic-domain dimerization is mediated by the N-terminal lobe. In addition to inducing a local unfolding of the Ser51 acceptor site in eIF2α, its mode of binding to PKR affords the Ser51 site full access to the catalytic cleft of PKR. The generality and implications of the structural mechanisms uncovered for PKR to the larger family of four human eIF2α protein kinases are discussed.

The generality and implications of the structural mechanisms uncovered for PKR to the larger family of four human eIF2α protein kinases are discussed. The RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR belongs to a family that shares the ability to phosphorylate the α subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2, a multisubunit G protein. Each family member, including PKR, the heme-regulated protein kinase HRI, the unfolded-protein-response regulator PERK, and the metabolite sensor GCN2, responds to distinct stress stimuli but transmits an overlapping signal that potently inhibits cellular translation through its ability to phosphorylate eIF2α on the same regulatory site, Ser51 (reviewed in Proud, 2005Proud C.G. eIF2 and the control of cell physiology.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The antiviral function of PKR is mediated by its ability to sense viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a general byproduct of viral infection. The sensing of dsRNA by PKR and its downstream signaling response are facilitated by a domain architecture consisting of two dsRNA binding domains followed by a serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase domain (Meurs et al., 1990Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. Molecular cloning and characterization of the human double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase induced by interferon.Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). In binding dsRNA, PKR dimerizes and autophosphorylates on Thr446 within the activation segment of its catalytic domain. This leads to the full catalytic activation of PKR and the selective ability to phosphorylate eIF2α (Nanduri et al., 2000Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24946-24958Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As a result of the phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser51, eIF2 forms a high-affinity sequestering interaction with its own guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. This complex inhibits the recycling of GTP for GDP on eIF2 prior to assembly of the 43S initiation complex, thus causing a general reduction in protein synthesis (reviewed in Dever, 2002Dever T.E. Gene-specific regulation by general translation factors.Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Owing to its potent antiviral role, most viruses, including numerous human pathogens, have devised mechanisms to subvert PKR function. The growing list includes the oncogenic viruses hepatitis C and Epstein-Barr as well as herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, adenovirus, human immunodefiency virus, poliovirus, baculovirus, vaccinia virus, and reovirus (reviewed in Clemens, 2004Clemens M.J. Targets and mechanisms for the regulation of translation in malignant transformation.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3180-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The study of the underlying mechanisms by which viruses subvert PKR function has shed light into the normal cellular workings of PKR. A case in point is the vaccinia virus protein K3L, which competitively blocks eIF2α phosphorylation by mimicking the three-dimensional structure of eIF2α and its mode of interaction with PKR (Kawagishi-Kobayashi et al., 1997Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Silverman J.B. Ung T.L. Dever T.E. Regulation of the protein kinase PKR by the vaccinia virus pseudosubstrate inhibitor K3L is dependent on residues conserved between the K3L protein and the PKR substrate eIF2alpha.Mol. Cell.

The precise mechanism by which PKR recognizes eIF2α and the mechanism by which dimerization and autophosphorylation control PKR catalytic activation and substrate recognition are long-standing areas of investigation. Oligomerization plays an essential role in regulating numerous protein kinases, most commonly through its ability to promote trans-autophosphorylation on regulatory sites both within and outside of the protein kinase catalytic domain (reviewed in Hubbard, 2004Hubbard S.R. Juxtamembrane autoinhibition in receptor tyrosine kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, Nolen et al., 2004Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G.

While dimerization could serve in part to promote trans-autophosphorylation of PKR by bringing two molecules in close proximity (Thomis and Samuel, 1995Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24946-24958Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the observation that PKR dimerization is required for the recognition of eIF2α and for the sensitivity of PKR to the viral inhibitor protein K3L suggests that a specific dimer configuration may be an integral feature of PKR’s active state (Dar and Sicheri, 2002Dar A.C.

Cell. 2002; 10: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PKR and the larger eIF2α protein kinase family employ a bipartite mechanism of substrate recognition. This is best illustrated by the fact that substitution of the Ser51 acceptor site in eIF2α for tyrosine still results in efficient phosphorylation by PKR (Lu et al., 1999Lu J. O’Hara E.B. Trieselmann B.A. Romano P.R. Dever T.E. The interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR will phosphorylate serine, threonine, or tyrosine at residue 51 in eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32198-32203Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that peptides derived from the Ser51 acceptor site of eIF2α are poor substrates as compared to the intact protein (0.6 μM versus 1080 μM, respectively; Mellor and Proud, 1991Mellor H. Proud C.G. A synthetic peptide substrate for initiation factor-2 kinases.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of the substrate-recognition determinants within eIF2α have been discerned by mutational analysis (Sharp et al., 1997Sharp T.V. Witzel J.E. Jagus R.

In brief, K3L and eIF2α employ a prestructured epitope to engage PKR that is presented by a common surface of their β barrel fold. The center of this prestructured epitope is remotely positioned 22 Å from the Ser51 phosphoacceptor site in eIF2α. In contrast, far less is known about the structural determinants for eIF2α recognition within PKR except that the determinants are fully contained within the catalytic domain and that recognition is dependent on catalytic-domain dimerization (Ung et al., 2001Ung T.L. Cao C. Lu J. Ozato K. Dever T.E.

In order to further our understanding of the molecular basis of eIF2α recognition by PKR and the structural role of dimerization and autophosphorylation in PKR function, we have determined X-ray crystal structures of the catalytic domain of PKR in complex with eIF2α. A 284 amino acid fragment of human PKR and a 175 amino acid fragment of S. cerevisiae eIF2α were expressed separately in bacteria, purified to homogeneity, and mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio for crystallization. The PKR crystallization construct extends from residues 258 to 551 and encompasses the protein kinase catalytic domain. Two point mutations, His412Asn (Dar and Sicheri, 2002Dar A.C. Sicheri F.

Additionally, a 13 residue deletion was introduced into the protease-sensitive β4–β5 loop of PKR (residues 338–350), which had the effect of eliminating the tendency of the protein to form high-molecular-weight aggregates at high concentrations, as evidenced by static light scattering. Importantly, the final crystallization construct forms a dimer in solution and maintains an ability to autophosphorylate on Thr446 and to phosphorylate eIF2α in vitro (Dey et al., 2005bDey M. Cao C. Dar A.C. Tamura T. Ozato K. Sicheri F. Dever T.E.

The eIF2α fragment consists of the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein (residues 3 to 175 out of 303 total residues), which is similar to constructs analyzed previously by NMR and X-ray crystallography (Nonato et al., 2002Nonato M.C.

Crystals of a PKR/eIF2α complex diffracting to 2.8 Å (space group P3221, a = b = 84.3 Å, c = 165.4 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°) and a PKR/eIF2α complex bound to the ATP analog, β,γ-imidoadenosine-5′-triphosphate (AMP-PNP) and diffracting to 2.5 Å (space group P21, a = 64.7 Å, b = 48.8 Å, c = 133.4 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 98.4°) were obtained. Structure determination of the P3221 and P21 crystal forms were performed by molecular replacement (see Experimental Procedures) and refined to Rfactor/Rfree values of 20.7%/26.8% to 2.8 Å resolution and Rfactor/ Rfree values of 22.8%/28.6% to 2.5 Å resolution, respectively. The asymmetric unit of the P3221 crystal form consists of a single molecule each of PKR and eIF2α. The asymmetric unit of the P21 crystal form consists of two PKR molecules, two AMP-PNP molecules, and one eIF2α molecule. Data-collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online. The final refined models display good geometry and Ramachandran statistics commensurate with the resolution of these studies. A representative composite simulated annealing omit electron density (|2Fo − Fc|) map centered on the phospho-Thr446 moiety of PKR is shown in Figure S1. Structure-based sequence alignments of the catalytic domains of the eIF2α protein kinases and the S1 subdomain of the eIF2α substrate and K3L pseudosubstrate proteins are shown in Figures 1A and 1B , respectively. A ribbon representation of the P3221 crystal complex is shown in Figure 1C. A ribbon representation of the P21 crystal complex and detailed views of the individual PKR catalytic domains are provided in Figure S2. A detailed view of eIF2α and comparative views of previously determined isolated eIF2α and K3L structures are provided in Figure S3. The catalytic domain of PKR adopts a bilobal structure typical of protein kinases, with a smaller N-terminal lobe (N lobe) and a larger C-terminal lobe (C lobe) connected by a short hinge (reviewed by Huse and Kuriyan, 2002Huse M. Kuriyan J. The conformational plasticity of protein kinases.Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). A higher-order dimeric configuration of the protein kinase domain is achieved by a back-to-back interaction of two N lobes, while the C lobe of PKR composes the binding site for eIF2α (Figure 1C). The dimer configuration of PKR is observed in both crystal forms analyzed. In the P3221 crystal form, the dimer configuration is crystallographic in nature, while in the P21 crystal form, the same dimer configuration is generated by two distinct PKR molecules in the asymmetric unit. Identical binding modes of eIF2α to PKR are observed in both crystal forms; however, only one of two PKR molecules in the P21 crystal form engages an eIF2α molecule. The smaller N lobe of the kinase domain (residues 258–369) consists of a twisted five-strand antiparallel β sheet (denoted β1 to β5), a canonical helix αC laterally flanking one side of the β sheet, and a noncanonical helix α0 (residues 258–266), which integrates into the top groove of the β sheet. The β4–β5 connecting loop of PKR, corresponding to the site of deletion of an eIF2α kinase characteristic insert, is disordered. The larger C lobe (residues 370–551) is comprised of two paired antiparallel β strands (β7–β8 and β6–β9) and eight α helices (αD to αJ). Relative to protein kinase structures determined to date, only helix αG appears grossly displaced from a canonical position (C-terminal α helices αI and αJ are noncanonical elements). Positioned between helices αE and αEF in the lower catalytic lobe lies the activation segment (residues 432–458), which serves a phosphoregulatory function in many protein kinases, including PKR (reviewed in Johnson et al., 1996Johnson L.N.

In the P21 crystal form, AMP-PNP binds at the cleft region of both PKR molecules, giving rise to a slightly more open configuration of catalytic lobes than is observed for PKR in the absence of bound nucleotide. The binding mode of AMP-PNP to PKR is generally the same as that observed in other active protein kinase structures (reviewed in Johnson et al., 1996Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J.

(A) Frontal view of the catalytic cleft of PKR in complex with the ATP analog AMP-PNP (P21 crystal form, molecule #1). The coloring scheme follows that of Figure 1C (left molecule), with the G loop of PKR also colored red. (B) Stereo view highlighting the P+1 loop of the activation segment of PKR and representative Ser/Thr and Tyrosine kinases in active states. Cα traces of activation segments are shown in color, while all other regions of the catalytic domains are shown in gray. The activation segments of two PKR molecules (from P3221 and P21 crystal forms) are shown in orange; the tyrosine protein kinases IRK, IGFRK, c-KIT, and EGFRK are shown in blue (PDB ID codes 1IR3 , 1K3A , 1PKG , and 1M14 , respectively); and the Ser/Thr protein kinases PKA, PHK, CDK2, and ERK2 are shown in green (PDB ID codes 1JBP , 2PHK , 1H25 , and 2ERK , respectively). A notable loss of packing interactions between the P+1 loop and the noncanonical position of helix αG in PKR, denoted by an arrow, may contribute to the forward orientation of the P+1 loop of PKR. The activation segments of PKR in the P3221 crystal form and of one PKR molecule in the P21 crystal form are stoichiometrically phosphorylated on Thr446 and adopt a fully structured winding conformation generally indicative of a catalytically competent state (Johnson et al., 1996Johnson L.N.

Ghosh G. Regulation of protein kinases; controlling activity through activation segment conformation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). This conformation is stabilized by the interaction of the Thr446 phosphate moiety with Lys304 and Arg307 side chains projecting from the N lobe helix αC and the Arg413 side chain projecting from the C lobe (Figure 2A). The Thr446 position and three phosphocoordinating residues are conserved in PKR, PERK, and HRI, but only Thr446 and Arg413 are conserved in GCN2 orthologs. In the second PKR molecule of the P21 crystal form, residues 437 to 451 of the activation segment are disordered (Figure S2C). Interestingly, this disorder correlates with disorder of the local eIF2α binding site of PKR, encompassing helix αG and also helix αD, and the absence of a bound eIF2α molecule (discussed below). The phosphorylation status of Thr446 in this molecule of PKR cannot be discerned. A subelement of the activation segment, termed the P+1 loop, is notable for defining Ser/Thr versus tyrosine kinase specificity by providing a docking site for the phosphoacceptor sequence of the substrate in the immediate vicinity of the active site (reviewed in Nolen et al., 2004Nolen B. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Regulation of protein kinases; controlling activity through activation segment conformation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). A common inward position of the P+1 loop relative to the catalytic cleft is optimized for orienting shorter serine and threonine side chains to accept phosphate, while a common outwardly positioned loop is optimized for the longer tyrosine side chain (Figure 2B). The diagnostic presence of threonine at position 451 of the P+1 loop, versus the proline residue characteristic of tyrosine kinases, is consistent with the best-characterized function of PKR as a Ser/Thr-directed protein kinase (Figure 1A). However, PKR can also phosphorylate on tyrosine, although the biological relevance of this activity is not well understood (Lu et al., 1999Lu J. O’Hara E.B. Trieselmann B.A. Romano P.R. Dever T.E. The interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase PKR will phosphorylate serine, threonine, or tyrosine at residue 51 in eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32198-32203Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the conformation of the P+1 loop of PKR adopts an extreme outward orientation from residues 448 to 452, approaching that of a tyrosine kinase (Figure2B). Preceding and following this region, the activation segment of PKR returns to a canonical Ser/Thr protein kinase conformation. This unexpected outward orientation for part of the P+1 loop appears to be influenced by the absence of packing interactions with a noncanonically oriented helix αG and a direct hydrogen bond between the P+1 loop and the Glu28 side chain of eIF2α (Figure 2, Figure 3). Since the phosphoacceptor sequence of eIF2α centered on Ser51 is not visible within the phosphoacceptor binding site of PKR (see below), the relevance of the P+1 loop distortion for orienting Ser51 for catalysis is unclear. However, if the P+1 loop distortion relates to the ability of PKR to phosphorylate on Ser/Thr and tyrosine residues (i.e., dual specificity), the P+1 loop distortion may have relevance for the mechanism of action of other dual-specificity protein kinases. Indeed, like PKR, most if not all dual-specificity protein kinases employ a P+1 loop signature motif diagnostic of Ser/Thr kinases and yet display the ability to phosphorylate on both Ser/Thr and tyrosine residues (Lindberg et al., 1992Lindberg R.A.

With the exception of the region surrounding the Ser51 phosphoacceptor site, the structure of eIF2α complexed to PKR is virtually identical to the X-ray crystal structure reported previously for an isolated S. cerevisiae protein fragment (Dhaliwal and Hoffman, 2003Dhaliwal S.

The eIF2α structure consists of an S1 subdomain (residues 3–90) flanked on one surface by a C-terminal α-helical subdomain (residues 91–175) (Figure S3). A major portion of the S1 subdomain, consisting of a five-strand β barrel (denoted β1 to β5), is highly conserved in primary and tertiary structure across the larger eIF2α and K3L protein family (Figure S3). The α-helical subdomain is unique to the eIF2α protein subfamily and consists of five α helices and one 310 helix (denoted α1 to α5 and 310C). The S1 subdomain is interrupted on one surface of the β barrel, opposite to the site of association with the C-terminal α-helical subdomain, by a helical insert between β strands 3 and 4. The helical insert is notable for its structural conservation within but not across the eIF2α and K3L protein subfamilies (Dar and Sicheri, 2002Dar A.C. Sicheri F.

https://openalex.org/W1981868559,"Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are important antioxidant enzymes responsible for the elimination of superoxide radical (O(2)(-)). The manganese-containing SOD (Mn-SOD) has been suggested to have tumor suppressor function and is located in the mitochondria where the majority of O(2)(-) is generated during respiration. Although increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells has long been recognized, the expression of Mn-SOD in cancer and its role in cancer development remain elusive. The present study used a human tissue microarray to analyze Mn-SOD expression in primary ovarian cancer tissues, benign ovarian lesions, and normal ovary epithelium. Significantly higher levels of Mn-SOD protein expression were detected in the malignant tissues compared with normal tissues (p < 0.05). In experimental systems, suppression of Mn-SOD expression by small interfering RNA caused a 70% increase of superoxide in ovarian cancer cells, leading to stimulation of cell proliferation in vitro and more aggressive tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, stimulation of mitochondrial O(2)(-) production induced an increase of Mn-SOD expression. Our findings suggest that the increase in Mn-SOD expression in ovarian cancer is a cellular response to intrinsic ROS stress and that scavenging of superoxide by SOD may alleviate the ROS stress and thus reduce the simulating effect of ROS on cell growth."

Western analysis showed that mature red cells contain Fas, FasL, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), caspase 8, and caspase 3.

Aged red cells had significantly lower aminophospholipid translocase activity and higher levels of PS externalization in comparison with young cells. In support of our contention that caspases play a functional role in the mature red cell, the oxidatively stressed red cell recapitulated apoptotic events, including translocation of Fas into rafts, formation of a Fas-associated complex, and activation of caspases 8 and 3. These events were independent of calpain but dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) as evident from the effects of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine. Caspase activation was associated with loss of aminophospholipid translocase activity and with PS externalization. ROS was not generated by treatment of cells with t-butyl hydroperoxide at 10 °C, and Fas did not translocate into rafts. Concomitantly, neither formation of a Fas-associated signaling complex nor caspase activation could be observed, supporting the view that translocation of Fas into rafts was the trigger for the chain of events leading to caspase 3 activation.

Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a physiological process that contributes to the homeostasis of multicellular organisms and maintains the balance between cell proliferation and cell death. The survival of nucleated mammalian cells depends on the constant repression of their self-destruction program by signals provided by other cells (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar, 2Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). Mature erythrocytes, like nucleated cells, share the capacity to self-destruct at the end of a 120-day life span or in response to environmental signals. It is therefore likely that erythrocyte survival, lifespan, and death are tightly regulated as in other cells. Whereas the process of apoptosis has been studied in depth in nucleated cells, the role of apoptotic regulatory molecules in enucleated cells such as platelets and erythrocytes is poorly understood. Although the presence of aspartate proteases has been documented for both cell types (3Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Mendes G.P.A. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R.

Activation of the effector caspases may occur by the engagement of death receptors (5Krammer P. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). In addition, most apoptotic stimuli turn on a mitochondrion-dependent pathway (6Desagher S. Martinuo J.C.

Erythrocytes were until recently considered to lack pathways that have been traditionally linked to activation of the apoptotic machinery in eukaryotic, nucleated cells. However, recent studies have pointed in a direction indicating that part of the machinery that is associated with execution of apoptosis in nucleated cells not only exists in the mature human erythrocyte but is likely to be of physiological significance. We have demonstrated that oxidative stress (9Mandal D. Moitra P.K. Saha S. Basu J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and erythrocyte aging (10Mandal D.

In the extrinsic pathway, apoptotic signals are initiated by cell surface death receptors exemplified by Fas, also known as CD95 or APO-1, leading to the caspase 8-dependent activation of effector caspases, such as caspase 3. Fas is widely expressed. Upon binding to FasL, Fas recruits a cytosolic adapter protein, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), which, in turn, recruits procaspase 8 and forms the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (11Boldin M.P.

Recruitment of procaspase 8 to the DISC results in activation and release of active caspase 8, which directly activates caspase 3 and initiates cell death (13Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).Considering that erythrocytes lack mitochondria, yet undergo activation of aspartate-proteases such as caspases, we reasoned that a machinery involving caspase 8 activation via death receptors prior to activation of caspase 3 might exist in the mature erythrocyte. Our present studies show that Fas, FasL, FADD, and caspase 8 localize to detergent-resistant membrane microdomains of aged and oxidatively stressed red cells. Concomitant with formation of this Fas-associated complex, aged or oxidatively stressed red cells showed caspase 8 and caspase 3 activity, as well as reduced aminophospholipid translocase (APLT) activity in comparison with young red cells. Our studies demonstrate unequivocally that signaling pathways, culminating in activation of the prototypical executioner caspase 3, play an essential role in PS externalization, a central event linked to erythrophagocytosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Anti-Fas and anti-caspase 8 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

All other reagents were of analytical grade.Separation and Treatment of Red Blood Cells—Fresh blood was collected from normal healthy volunteers with informed consent, and packed erythrocytes were collected after centrifugation over a Ficoll gradient. The erythrocytes were then washed three times in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (buffer A) and diluted to 2% hematocrit in the same buffer. Erythrocytes were treated for 15 min at 37 °C with diamide, Ph-hyz, t-BHP, or NEM at the indicated concentrations.Separation of Red Blood Cells on Percoll-Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Gradients—Density-dependent separation of red cells was performed as described by Corsi et al. (14Corsi D. Paiardini M. Crinelli R. Bucchini A. Magnani M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the plasma was removed, and erythrocytes were washed three times with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm glucose (PBSG buffer) and layered at 25% hematocrit on a discontinuous Percoll (55-85%, v/v)-BSA gradient followed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 20 min at 20 °C. Young and aged erythrocytes were collected separately and washed in PBSG buffer.Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—ROS produced within erythrocytes were detected with the membrane-permeable probe DCFH-DA. The probe freely enters the cell and is incorporated into hydrophobic regions. The acetate moiety is cleaved off by cellular esterases, leaving a nonfluorescent and impermeable form of DCFH (15Bass D.A. Parce J.W. DeChatelet L.R. Szejde P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). ROS produced by cells oxidizes DCFH to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Erythrocytes were incubated with 100 μm DCFH-DA in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, prior to application of stress. Fluorescence was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 538 nm (16Shi Q. Chen H.-L. Xu H. Gibson G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10888-10896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Western Blotting—Erythrocytes (2 × 108 cells) were usually lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm pefabloc) (buffer B). Lysates were clarified, and proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing Tween 20 (1%, v/v) (TBST) and 5% (w/v) BSA. After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) (or appropriate secondary antibody) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by development with BM chemiluminescence reagent (Roche Applied Science) and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co. XAR5). When performing Western blotting for detection of caspases, 6 × 105 cells were pelleted, freeze-thawed in 20 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES/NaOH, pH 6.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). Rabbit polyclonal anti-FADD, anti-FasL, anti-caspase 3, and anti-caspase 8 antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1,000.Immunoprecipitation—Erythrocytes (2 × 108 cells) were lysed in buffer B for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated overnight with rabbit anti-Fas antibody (1:200) or anti-caspase 8 antibody (1:100) at 4 °C. The supernatant was further incubated with 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose slurry for 3 h at 4°C. Beads were pelleted, washed three time in lysis buffer, and finally boiled in SDS gel denaturing buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE prior to Western blotting.Fixation of Cells, Staining, and Confocal Microscopy—Treated and untreated erythrocytes were fixed in 95% methanol, 5% PBS for 5 min on glass slides. Cells were permeabilized further with 0.1% Triton X-100 in the same fixative solution for 1 min. Blocking was done in PBS containing 3% BSA (PBSB) for 30 min at room temperature. Staining with antibodies and washing of cells was done in PBSB. Mouse monoclonal anti-Fas, rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase 8, and anti-Gαs were used at a dilution of 1:1,500 to stain the cells for 1 h at room temperature. Alexa 546-conjugated anti-mouse- and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit-specific secondary antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:1,500 for 30 min at room temperature. After each staining, cells were washed thoroughly, and samples were mounted with glycerol/PBS (4:1) and observed under a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.Determination of Aminophospholipid Translocase Activity—Flippase activity was assessed from the extent of fluorescent phospholipid retained in the plasma membrane after back-extraction with BSA, which extracts only exogenously added fluorescent phospholipids and not endogenous phospholipids, from the outer monolayer (17Blumenfeld N. Zachowski A. Galacteros F. Beuzard Y. Devaux P.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 849-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, NBD-PS was reconstituted in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 14 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose (buffer C). The lipid was added to a final concentration of 1 μm to erythrocytes and incubated on ice for 5 min in buffer C, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. 100-μl aliquots were removed at different time intervals and added to 1 ml of cold buffer B containing 1% fatty acid-free BSA in order to extract NBD-PS present in the outer leaflet. Fluorescence associated with the supernatant was measured in a spectrofluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 472 nm and an emission wavelength of 534 nm.Determination of Annexin Binding to Red Cells—Labeling with annexin-fluos was performed using the annexin-fluos kit from Roche Applied Science according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data acquisition was performed on a BD Biosiences FACScaliber flow cytometer, and analysis was done with Cell Quest software. 10,000 events/sample were acquired to ensure adequate mean fluorescence levels. The percentage of annexin V-positive erythrocytes was determined from the fluorescence signal in excess of that obtained with a negative (unlabeled) control that was run in each case.Isolation of Lipid Rafts from Erythrocyte Ghosts—Erythrocyte ghosts were prepared from young, aged, or oxidatively stressed cells separated on Percoll-BSA gradients as described above. Detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions were isolated from ghosts according to the method of Samuel et al. (18Samuel B.U. Narla M. Harrison T. Reid M. Rosse W. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29319-29329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, ghosts from 2 × 109 cells were extracted at 4 °C in 1.5 ml of TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm EDTA and subjected to a sucrose flotation gradient. After 30 min at 4 °C, the extract was mixed with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose, overlaid with 30% (w/v) sucrose and 5% sucrose, and subjected to ultracentrifugation in an AH-629 rotor (Sorvall) at 27,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C. The top 4 ml was collected as the first fraction. Proceeding down the gradient, fractions 2-6 were collected as 3-ml aliquots. Samples were precipitated with chilled acetone, and 40 μg of each protein sample was separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with different antibodies.Cholesterol Depletion of Erythrocytes—“Lipid rafts” are now widely accepted as membrane microdomains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol (19Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 20Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). Cyclodextrins selectively extract cholesterol and disrupt membrane rafts (21Ohtani Y. Irie T. Uekama K. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion was accomplished by treating erythrocytes (at 5% hematocrit) in PBS containing 3 mm KCl with 4 mm MβCD for 2 h at 37 °C (23Giddings K.S. Johnson A.Z. Tweten R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 20: 11315-11320Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The erythrocytes were washed with PBS to remove MβCD and associated cholesterol. Approximately 90% of the total cholesterol was removed by this process, since erythrocyte cholesterol is almost entirely associated with the plasma membrane.Chemical Cross-linking by DTSSP—DTSSP is a water-soluble, impermeable, thiol-cleavable cross-linker. For cross-linking, 2 × 108 erythrocytes/ml were incubated with 1 mm DTSSP in PBS at 25 °C (24Muppidi J.R. Siegel R.M. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) for 30 min. The reaction mix was further incubated with 10 mm Tris-HCl for 15 min at 25 °C to terminate the cross-linking reaction. Cells were then lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm iodoacetate, protease inhibitors, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fas antibody as described earlier. After immunoprecipitation, samples were divided in two portions and boiled separately in SDS gel denaturing sample buffer (reducing condition) and β-mercaptoethanol-free sample buffer (nonreducing condition). Samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Fas antibody.Caspase Activity Assays—For caspase 3 or caspase 8 activity assays, each well of microtiter plates was coated overnight with 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal caspase 3 or caspase 8 antibody in sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. After washing with TBST, wells were incubated with TBST containing 3% BSA for 30 min for blocking. Cell-free lysates (from 2 × 108 cells) were loaded in appropriate wells, incubated for 4 h at room temperature, and washed, and DEVDase- or IETDase-dependent protease activity was determined using the colorimetric substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA or the fluorimetric substrate Ac-IETD-AFC, respectively, at a concentration of 100 μm in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm DTT. pNA release was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. AFC release was measured in a spectrofluorimeter using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 530 nm, respectively.Statistical Analysis—Data are represented as the means ± S.D. of separate experiments. Student's t test was performed to test statistical significance. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSActivation of Caspase 8 in Old Red Cells—In normal density-dependent methods of separation, the youngest red cells are the lightest, whereas the aged cells are in the dense fractions (25Connor J. Pak C.C. Schroit A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2399-2404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite some controversy over the years, the dense fraction of circulating red cells is widely accepted to be enriched in aged erythrocytes (26Christian J.A. Wang J. Rettig H. Low P.S. Blood. 1998; 92: 2590-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, for the purpose of this study, the dense fraction of red cells (density higher than 1.1 g/ml) will be referred to as aged (or old) red cells, and the fraction with a density lower than 1.082 g/ml will be referred to as young red cells. Our previous observations had demonstrated that active caspase 3 is present in old red cells, whereas it could not be detected in young cells (10Mandal D. Baudin-Creuza V. Bhattacharyya A. Pathak S. Delaunay J. Kundu M. Basu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52551-52558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Since erythrocytes are devoid of mitochondria, a mitochondria-independent pathway of caspase 3 activation appeared possible. We therefore considered the possibility that caspase 3 activation could be preceded by formation of a DISC-like assembly involving a death receptor, followed by caspase 8 activation. This was further explored as a likelihood, since caspase 8 and the death receptor Fas have been shown to play an important role in erythroid development (27de Maria R. Zeuner A. Eramo A. Domenichelli C. Bonci D. Grignani F. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Testa U. Peschle C. Nature. 1999; 40: 489-493Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The cleaved 43/41-kDa caspase 8 band could be detected by Western blotting in old but not in young red cells (Fig. 1A). An activity assay using the substrate Ac-IETD-AFC showed a 3-4-fold increase in proteolytic activity in old cells compared with young cells over three independent sets of experiments.Association of Fas with FADD and Caspase 8—In order to analyze whether caspase 8 activation is associated with formation of complexes involving death receptors and death-linked adapter proteins, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Red cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Fas antibody, followed by Western blotting either with anti-caspase 8 or with anti-FADD antibody. Both caspase 8 and FADD were found in the immunoprecipitates from old cells (Fig. 1B) but not from the young cells. In addition, FasL was also found to associate with Fas in old cells (Fig. 1B). The association of caspase 8 with Fas was further confirmed by confocal microscopy. Fas was present in the plasma membrane, whereas caspase 8 displayed punctate staining in the cytosol of young cells (Fig. 2A). However, caspase 8 translocated to the membrane in old cells. Merging of the images suggested that caspase 8 colocalizes with Fas in patches observed in old cells (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Association of Fas with caspase 8 as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Young (A) and old (B) cells were incubated with anti-Fas and anti-caspase 8 (casp. 8) antibody. Cells were washed and labeled with Alexa 488-conjugated rabbit IgG (green for caspase 8) and Alexa 546-conjugated mouse IgG (red for Fas) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Colocalization of Fas with caspase 8 upon merging (yellow patches) was observed in the case of old (B) cells only. The results shown are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Clustering of Fas in Membrane Microdomains in Old Red Cells—Re-distribution of Fas into plasma membrane rafts is one possible mechanism for regulating the efficiency of Fas-mediated death signaling (28Hueber A.O.

Samuel B.U. Akompong T. Hamm H.E. Narla M. Lomasney J. Haldar K Science. 2003; 301: 1734-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Considering that translocation of Fas into lipid rafts generates death-inducing signaling platforms (32Gajate C. Mollinedo F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3860-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and that clusters of Fas were observable in old cells by confocal microscopy, we asked the question whether Fas translocates into membrane rafts in the aged red cell. The consistent localization of Gαs in erythrocyte rafts is documented (18Samuel B.U. Narla M. Harrison T. Reid M. Rosse W. Haldar K. J. Biol.

Confocal microscopy showed that the Fas clusters observed in old cells colocalized with Gαs (Fig. 3A). However, no colocalization of Fas with Gαs was observed in young cells (Fig. 3B).

Cohesin’s Smc1 and Smc3 “heads” are connected by an α kleisin subunit called Scc1, forming a tripartite ring with a diameter around 40 nm. We show here that some cohesin remains tightly bound to circular minichromosomes after their purification from yeast cells and that cleavage either of cohesin’s ring or of the minichromosome’s DNA destroys their association. This suggests that the stable association between cohesin and chromatin detected here is topological rather than physical, which is consistent with the notion that DNA is trapped inside cohesin rings.

This suggests that the stable association between cohesin and chromatin detected here is topological rather than physical, which is consistent with the notion that DNA is trapped inside cohesin rings. In eukaryotic cells, sister molecules of chromosomal DNA (sister chromatids) are held together (cohesed) from the time of their generation during S phase until their segregation to opposite poles of the cell during anaphase. Sister chromatid cohesion is essential for ensuring that sister kinetochores attach to microtubules that originate from the opposite poles of the cell, a process called amphitelic attachment or biorientation. This is achieved because the interconnection of sister DNAs resists the tendency of amphitelically attached microtubules to split chromatids and thereby generates the tension thought to stabilize microtubule-kinetochore attachments (Ault and Nicklas, 1989Ault J.G. Nicklas R.B.

The destruction of cohesion, which only occurs when all chromosomes have bioriented, triggers the segregation of chromatids at the metaphase to anaphase transition. Sister chromatid cohesion depends on a multisubunit complex called cohesin that comprises two SMC proteins, Smc1 and Smc3, and two non-SMC components Scc1 and Scc3 (Guacci et al., 1997Guacci V.

Smc1 and Smc3 form similar rod shaped proteins whose two globular ends are connected by a 50 nm long intramolecular antiparallel coiled coil formed by folding the proteins around their central globular regions (Haering et al., 2002Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Molecular architecture of SMC proteins and the yeast cohesin complex.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Heterotypic interaction between the latter creates V-shaped Smc1/Smc3 heterodimers whose two arms contain at their tips “heads” composed of N- and C-terminal sequences of individual Smc proteins that combine together to form ABC-like ATPase domains. ATP is thought to promote association of the ATPase heads of Smc1 and Smc3 by binding Walker A and B motifs within one head and a signature motif within its partner. This creates an unstable bipartite ring capable of hydrolyzing the two ATP molecules sandwiched between the two heads of a Smc1/Smc3 heterodimer. Cohesin’s third subunit Scc1 is a member of the kleisin superfamily of proteins (Schleiffer et al., 2003Schleiffer A. Kaitna S. Maurer-Stroh S. Glotzer M. Nasmyth K. Eisenhaber F. Kleisins: a superfamily of bacterial and eukaryotic SMC protein partners.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 571-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Scc1’s C-terminal sequences form a winged helix domain that interacts very tightly with Smc1’s ATPase head (Haering et al., 2004Haering C.H. Schoffnegger D. Nishino T. Helmhart W. Nasmyth K. Lowe J. Structure and stability of cohesin’s Smc1-Kleisin interaction.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 951-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Its N-terminal sequences have been predicted to form a related helix turn helix domain that binds Smc3’s head. The connection (i.e., bridging) of Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase heads by Scc1 creates an enormous tripartite ring whose integrity is essential for cohesion between sister chromatids (Anderson et al., 2002Anderson D.E. Losada A. Erickson H.P. Hirano T. Condensin and cohesin display different arm conformations with characteristic hinge angles.J.

Thus, in metaphase arrested cells cleavage of Scc1 between its N- and C-terminal domains at recognition sites for the Tobacco Etch Virus protease (TEV) inserted within Scc1 causes cohesin to dissociate from chromosomes, destroys cohesion between sister chromatids, and triggers their disjunction toward opposite poles of the cell (Uhlmann et al., 1999Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Sister-chromatid separation at anaphase onset is promoted by cleavage of the cohesin subunit Scc1.Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, Uhlmann et al., 2000Uhlmann F.

Cleavage of cohesin by the CD clan protease separin triggers anaphase in yeast.Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Cleavage of TEV sites inserted at opposing positions along Smc3’s coiled coil also causes cohesin’s dissociation from chromosomes and the destruction of sister chromatid cohesion (Gruber et al., 2003Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K. Chromosomal cohesin forms a ring.Cell. 2003; 112: 765-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Crucially, the disjunction of sister chromatids at the metaphase to anaphase transition in vivo depends on cleavage of Scc1’s central domain by a site-specific thiol protease called separase (Uhlmann et al., 1999Uhlmann F. Lottspeich F. Nasmyth K. Sister-chromatid separation at anaphase onset is promoted by cleavage of the cohesin subunit Scc1.Nature. 1999; 400: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, Uhlmann et al., 2000Uhlmann F.

Cleavage of cohesin by the CD clan protease separin triggers anaphase in yeast.Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The discovery that cohesin’s cleavable α kleisin subunit bridges the two heads of V-shaped Smc1/Smc3 heterodimers (Haering et al., 2002Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Molecular architecture of SMC proteins and the yeast cohesin complex.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) suggests that cohesin’s stable association with chromatin could arise from the trapping of double helical DNA molecules inside the tripartite ring created by Scc1, Smc1, and Smc3. Indeed, trapping of sister DNA molecules within a single cohesin ring would explain not only how sister DNAs are held together but also how separase destroys their interconnection at the metaphase to anaphase transition. With a potential diameter of 40 nm, cohesin rings would be large enough to accommodate two 10 nm nucleosomal chromatin fibers. To address the nature of cohesin’s interaction with chromatin, we have developed a procedure to purify replicated circular minichromosomes from yeast. The cohesin that is tightly associated with these chromosomes is released by cleavage either of Scc1 or of Smc3. Cohesin is also released by linearization of the minichromosome due to cleavage at a unique restriction site. These observations imply that the connection between cohesin and chromatin is primarily topological and not physical. To investigate the nature of sister chromatid cohesion, we developed a method to isolate small circular chromosomes from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To ensure that the chromosomes would be associated with cohesin that might actually be engaged in holding sister DNAs together, we used circular DNAs that contain not only a selective marker and an origin of DNA replication but also an active centromere (Figure 1A ). We chose circular centromeric plasmids because centromeres are known to confer not only cohesin recruitment but also cohesion between sister DNAs (Megee et al., 1999Megee P.C. Mistrot C. Guacci V. Koshland D. The centromeric sister chromatid cohesion site directs Mcd1p binding to adjacent sequences.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 445-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We used an affinity-based method utilizing the interaction between Tet repressor and its operator (Figure 1B). Host yeast strains expressed a TetR-GFP protein-A fusion protein that bound in vivo to a tandem array of 21 (or more) operators embedded in a 3.5 kb circular plasmid containing the TRP1 gene, its neighboring replication origin, and an 850 bp fragment containing the centromere from chromosome IV (Figure 1A). Cells were grown until midlog phase and then arrested in a mitotic-like state by addition of nocodazole. This not only disrupted any microtubule-kinetochore interactions that might jeopardize the isolation of minichromosomes but also ensured that all chromosomes were fully replicated. After harvesting, cells were spheroplasted by treatment with lyticase, lysed by the addition of a Triton X-100 buffer containing RNase, and most if not all chromosomal chromatin removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting extracts, containing most minichromosome but very little chromosomal DNA (Figures 1C and 1D), were incubated overnight with IgG beads, which caused depletion of most TetR-GFP protein-A fusion protein from the extract as judged by Western blot analysis (data not shown). 30%–70% of minichromosomes containing Tet operators bound to the IgG beads (Figure 1C) while minichromosomes lacking any operators bound not at all and ones with only seven operators bound inefficiently (data not shown). Binding was dependent on expression of the TetR-GFP protein-A fusion protein (Figure 1E). Bound minichromosomes were eluted from the IgG beads by addition of anhydrotetracycline. The minichromosome preparations contained little or no contaminating nucleic acid, as judged from ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels (Figure 1D), and less than 0.1% of the protein present in the cleared extract, consistent with a 500-fold enrichment relative to total protein. To detect proteins bound to purified minichromosome DNAs, we used yeast strains that expressed (from endogenous genes) HA epitope tagged proteins and measured the ability of magnetic protein A dynabeads in conjunction with the 12CA5 HA-specific monoclonal antibody to precipitate minichromosome DNA. The abundance of minichromosome DNA in immunoprecipitates was measured by Southern blotting (Figure 2A ). HA epitopes on histone H2B (Htb1-HA3) or the centromere-specific histone H3 CENP-A (Cse4-HA6) enabled immunoprecipitation of most minichromosome DNA whereas the same epitope fused to cohesin’s Scc1 subunit enabled immunoprecipitation of about 20% of the starting minichromosome DNA. This DNA was also immunoprecipitated when Smc1 and Scc3 were HA tagged but poorly if at all when no yeast proteins were tagged (Figure 2A). Previous studies using either chromosome spreading or chromatin immunoprecipitation suggest that cohesin’s stable association with chromosomes depends on a separate factor composed of the Scc2 and Scc4 proteins (Ciosk et al., 2000Ciosk R. Shirayama M. Shevchenko A. Tanaka T. Toth A. Nasmyth K. Cohesin’s binding to chromosomes depends on a separate complex consisting of Scc2 and Scc4 proteins.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) but not on a protein called Eco1/Ctf7 (Skibbens et al., 1999Skibbens R.V. Corson L.B. Koshland D. Hieter P. Ctf7p is essential for sister chromatid cohesion and links mitotic chromosome structure to the DNA replication machinery.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, Toth et al., 1999Toth A.

Yeast cohesin complex requires a conserved protein, Eco1p(Ctf7), to establish cohesion between sister chromatids during DNA replication.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 320-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) that is essential for building cohesion between sister chromatids during S phase (Figure 2B). To test whether cohesin associated with minichromosomes has the same properties, we compared the amount of minichromosome DNA associated with Scc1-HA6 after wild-type, scc2-4, and eco1-1 mutant cells had undergone DNA replication at the restrictive temperature. Association was greatly reduced by the scc2 mutation but unaffected by the eco1 mutation (Figure 2B). The association between cohesin and minichromosome DNA detected in our assay does not therefore depend on the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. A circular plasmid immobilized due to its association with cohesin provides an ideal system for addressing the nature of their association. We first investigated whether severing cohesin’s ring causes dissociation of DNA. We isolated minichromosomes from a yeast strain whose SCC1 gene produces an HA tagged Scc1 protein containing between its N- and C-terminal domains three cleavage sites for the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease. Incubation with TEV protease prior to immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 antibody cleaved all Scc1 molecules (note that most protein in these preparations is not in fact associated with the plasmid) and largely abolished copurification of plasmid DNA with cohesin (Figure 3). This effect was clearly due to cleavage of Scc1 by TEV protease and not due to some unknown activity associated with the protease because its addition to minichromosomes isolated from cells whose HA tagged Scc1 protein lacked TEV cleavage sites had no effect on DNA coprecipitation with cohesin (Figure 3). To investigate the effect of cleaving Smc3’s coiled coil, we isolated minichromosomes from cells whose Smc3 protein contained either a pair of TEV cleavage sites at opposing positions within its coiled coil or a single TEV site in only a single Smc3 polypeptide strand. Cleavage of the former with TEV protease severs Smc3’s coiled coil whereas cleavage of the latter merely nicks it, leaving the cohesin ring both intact and functional (Gruber et al., 2003Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K. Chromosomal cohesin forms a ring.Cell. 2003; 112: 765-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Both sets of cells also expressed HA tagged Scc1 protein. Severance of Smc3’s coiled coil but not its nicking abolished coprecipitation of minichromosome DNA with Scc1 (Figure 4). Our finding that severance either of Scc1 or of Smc3 destroys the association of cohesin with a circular minichromosome is consistent with previous findings, namely that both methods of severing cohesin rings cause cohesin’s release from crude chromatin preparations as well as from chromosomes in vivo (Gruber et al., 2003Gruber S. Haering C.H. Nasmyth K. Chromosomal cohesin forms a ring.Cell. 2003; 112: 765-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The current experiments have the advantage that they involve a well defined and highly purified chromatin substrate. Our finding that the integrity of cohesin rings is essential for their association with minichromosomes implies that no single domain is responsible. Association could instead arise from interlocking (catenation) of two circular objects, namely cohesin and DNA. If so, cleavage of the DNA as well as severance of the cohesin ring would be predicted to release cohesin from its “embrace”, assuming that cohesin rings can slide along chromatin in vitro. We therefore investigated the effect on cohesin’s association with DNA of cleaving minichromosomes at a unique Bgl II site while they were still bound to the IgG sepharose matrix via their Tet repressor protein A fusion protein. This Bgl II site is fortuitously located in a nucleosome-free area near the minichromosome’s origin of DNA replication (Thoma et al., 1984Thoma F. Bergman L.W. Simpson R.T. Nuclease digestion of circular TRP1ARS1 chromatin reveals positioned nucleosomes separated by nuclease-sensitive regions.J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 715-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which permits efficient cleavage by prolonged incubation with enzyme at 4°C. Following DNA cleavage, both cleaved and uncleaved minichromosomes were eluted from the sepharose beads by addition of anhydrotetracycline. About 90% of the circular DNA was linearized by this procedure (Figure 5B ). The efficiency with which residual closed and nicked circular forms of the plasmid were recovered in the bound fraction (i.e., immunoprecipitated on dynabeads with Scc1-HA6) was largely unaltered by incubation with Bgl II. In contrast, few if any linearized minichromosomes were immunoprecipitated with Scc1-HA6 (Figure 5B). The reduction in coprecipitation of linearized minichromosome DNA with cohesin was due to cleavage of the minichromosome because copurification with cohesin of an otherwise identical plasmid whose Bgl II site had been mutated was unaltered by incubation with the enzyme (Figure 5C). Insertion of seven tandem EcoR I restriction sites permitted cleavage with EcoR I one kilobase away from the Bgl II site. Minichromosomes linearized by EcoR I also failed to coprecipitate with cohesin (Figure 5D), suggesting that the effect of DNA cleavage is independent of its location on the minichromosome. To address whether DNA cleavage has any effect on the association of minichromosomes with CENP-A, we analyzed the effect of Bgl II cleavage on coprecipitation of DNA with Cse4-HA6. In contrast to cohesin, linearized minichromosomes coprecipitated with Cse4-HA6 nearly as efficiently as uncleaved circular forms (Figure 5E). Coprecipitation with an HA tagged version of histone H2B was similarly unaffected by linearization (data not shown). We also investigated the effect on their association with cohesin of merely nicking minichromosomes, by inserting a site for the N.BbvC IA nicking enzyme at the minichromosome’s Bgl II site. Without enzymatic nicking, 30% of the plasmid in the preparation was nicked and 70% supercoiled (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). After nicking of the plasmid while bound to the sepharose beads an additional 47% of the total plasmid was converted to a nicked form resulting in a 77% versus 23% nicked to closed form ratio. Nicking of the minichromosomes caused about a 2-fold reduction of the efficiency of their copurification with cohesin (19% of the plasmid immunoprecipitated before nicking versus 9% after), an effect that is much less drastic than that caused by linearization. The effect of converting closed circular DNAs to open circles could be an artifact of the immunoprecipitation procedure since a similar reduction in the amount of the plasmid bound to the beads after nicking was often observed when Cse4 was immunoprecipitated instead of cohesin (see for example Figure 5E). We cannot however totally exclude the possibility that a fraction of cohesin is associated with minichromosomes in a manner that is sensitive to the state of DNA supercoiling. In the experiments described above, a considerable period of time elapses between DNA cleavage and the measurement of its association with cohesin. To minimize this time period, we tested whether circular DNA already bound to dynabeads due to its association with cohesin can be released from these beads by linearization (Figure 6B ). Cohesin and associated circular minichromosomes were directly immunoprecipitated from extracts using dynabeads (Figure 6A). After one hour digestion at 4°C in the presence or absence of Bgl II or TEV protease, the dynabeads were washed successively with 0.15, 0.35, 0.65, and finally 1.65 M salt. Fifty percent of circular DNA remained associated with the dynabeads after these washes. TEV cleavage caused most circular DNA to be released into the supernatant after the 0.15 M salt wash and 2% (or less) remained on the beads after all four washes (Figures 6C and 6D). Linearization of the DNA with Blg II had the same effect. Most DNA was released after the first wash and little or no DNA (0.2%) remained on the beads after all four washes (Figures 6C and 6D). Importantly, the circular DNAs that resisted Blg II cleavage behaved quite differently; 54% remained on the beads after all four washes (Figures 6C and 6D). Similar results were obtained when minichromosomes were cleaved with EcoR I instead of Bgl II (data not shown). We conclude that linearization triggers rapid release of minichromosomes from cohesin associated with dynabeads. Additional evidence that linear but not nicked minichromosomes have a reduced affinity for cohesin came from experiments in which yeast cells were instead broken by grinding with a motor-driven pestle under liquid nitrogen, which shears a significant fraction of minichromosome DNA in one or more places (Figure 6E). Both open (nicked) and closed circular minichromosomes were found associated with cohesin but linearized forms largely not. Importantly, this effect was observed with 5 and 7.5 kb minichromosomes as well as with the 3.5 kb one (Figure 6F). The activity of a restriction enzyme is therefore not necessary for dissociation of linear DNA from cohesin. In summary, our data indicate that the efficiency with which circular minichromosomes can be immunoprecipitated is at least 10 (and possibly 100 times) greater than that of linearized ones. We conclude that cohesin cannot maintain a stable association with linear fragments of chromatin that are 10 kb or shorter. The simplest version of the embrace model envisions DNA’s entrapment within a single cohesin ring. It is nevertheless possible that cohesin only associates tightly with chromatin as a multimeric complex containing two or more tightly associated cohesin rings (Figures S2A and S2C) or even as a filament containing multiple molecules of each cohesin subunit (Figure S2B). If cohesin formed such multimeric complexes, then it should be possible to detect association between two different molecules of a given cohesin subunit, namely between Scc1 molecules tagged with HA and Myc epitopes expressed from two differently tagged SCC1 genes in diploid cells. No such association could be detected in a population of cohesin complexes released from chromatin by treatment with micrococcal nuclease (Haering et al., 2002Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Molecular architecture of SMC proteins and the yeast cohesin complex.Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). This experiment would not however have been able to detect association between different Scc1 molecules while they were still associated with chromatin. Our ability to detect directly the association between cohesin and a minichromosome provides an opportunity to test whether the interaction requires cohesin multimers. If association between two or more Smc1/Smc3 heterodimers were required for cohesin to associate with minichromosomes, then cleavage of just one Scc1 subunit from this “minimal” set of complexes should release cohesin from DNA (Figure S2A). Likewise, if cohesin had to form filaments (with a critical length) to associate with minichromosomes, then cleavage of half of the Scc1 subunits from such a filament should also release cohesin from DNA (Figure S2B). To test this, we constructed a diploid strain whose two SCC1 genes encoded differently tagged proteins: one with a C-terminal HA-tag (HA6) and multiple TEV sites in the middle portion of the protein and another with a C-terminal Myc-tag (Myc18) and devoid of any TEV sites. This permitted us to open one half of cohesin rings by cleaving their Scc1 subunits with TEV protease while leaving another half intact. If cohesin associated with DNA as a monomeric ring, then DNA associated with HA epitopes should be quantitatively released by TEV cleavage while DNA associated with Myc epitopes should be unaffected (Figure 7A ). If, on the other hand, cohesin only interacted with DNA say as a dimer, then two thirds of cohesin complexes containing Myc epitopes should be associated with TEV cleavable complexes. If we assume that complexes containing a single Myc tagged Scc1 were immunoprecipitated as efficiently as those containing two such Scc1 molecules, then two thirds of the DNA immunoprecipitated by Myc-specific antibodies should be released by TEV cleavage. If, however, the former were immunoprecipitated twice as efficiently as the latter, then one half of the DNA associated with Scc1-Myc18 should be released by TEV cleavage. An even higher fraction of Scc1-Myc18 would be predicted to dissociate from DNA upon TEV cleavage if cohesin only associated as trimers or yet higher order complexes. An alternative scenario is that different cohesin rings can indeed associate with DNA as monomeric complexes but that they invariably associate with a second complex or indeed with several other complexes, any one of which could also associate (independently of the first complex) with DNA (Figure S2C). Under these circumstances, some two thirds or more of TEV cleavable HA tagged Scc1 molecules would be associated with uncleavable Myc-tagged complexes whose association with the HA complex and with DNA would prevent release of DNA from Scc1-HA6 upon TEV cleavage. If on the other hand, cohesin never associates stably with other cohesin complexes associated with DNA, then all DNA associated with HA tagged Scc1 should be released by TEV cleavage. To test these predictions, minichromosomes were isolated from lysates prepared from diploid cells (expressing TEV cleavable Scc1-HA6 and TEV uncleavable Scc1-Myc18) using Tet repressor affinity chromatography, eluted from the IgG sepharose beads, and treated with TEV protease. Intact and cleaved Scc1 proteins were then immunoprecipitated via Myc or HA tags, respectively, and their association with minichromosomes was analyzed by a Southern blot. The experiment was repeated three times with very similar results. The amount of minichromosome DNA coimmunoprecipitated with HA epitopes after cleavage with TEV protease was only 6.5% (SD = 0.6%) of the amount coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of TEV treatment and indeed very close to background levels of 6.1 (SD = 1.3%) (Figure 7B). The amount of minichromosome DNA coprecipitated with Myc epitopes was not affected by the addition of TEV with 92.5% of the DNA (SD = 13.7%) precipitated after cleavage (Figure 7C). These data are consistent with the notion that individual cohesin rings interact with DNA. They also suggest that the cohesin complexes associated with minichromosomes are not stably associated with other cohesin complexes. Finally, it should be pointed out that it is quite conceivable that few if any of our minichromosomes retain an association with more than a single cohesin complex after their extensive purification. If so, our assay must necessarily detect stable association between individual cohesin complexes and minichromosomal DNA. The structures established by cohes"

Here, we show that the FK506 binding protein Fpr3 prevents premature adaptation to damage and thus serves to maintain recombination checkpoint activity. Impaired checkpoint function is observed both in cells lacking FPR3 and in cells treated with rapamycin, a small molecule inhibitor that binds to the proline isomerase (PPIase) domain of Fpr3. FPR3 functions in the checkpoint through controlling protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Fpr3 interacts with PP1 through its PPIase domain, regulates PP1 localization, and counteracts the activity of PP1 in vivo.

Sam68 is a prototype of STAR proteins, so named for their implication in signal transduction and activation of RNA metabolism (5.Lukong K.E. Richard S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). STAR proteins contain the GSG (GRP33, Sam68, and GLD-1) or STAR domain, an evolutionarily conserved protein module initially identified by aligning the first three members of this family (6.Di Fruscio M.

Although the precise role of Sam68 is unknown, its multifunctionality is revealed by the presence of polyproline sequences, an RNA-binding K homology module shared by all GSG/STAR proteins and multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (5.Lukong K.E.

Fujisawa J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5452-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Several reports have indicated that phosphorylation regulates key cellular roles of Sam68. Both tyrosine phosphorylation and SH3 binding severely hamper the RNA binding capability of Sam68 (13.Wang L.L. Richard S. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2010-2013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14.Taylor S.J. Anafi M. Pawson T. Shalloway D. J. Biol.

Sam68 was found to interact and colocalize with the splicing-associated factor YT512-B, to synergize with the human immunodeficiency virus Rev protein, enhancing export of unspliced viral RNA, and to increase protein expression from RNA containing the constitutive transport element of some retroviruses (3.Derry J.J.

On the other hand, activation of the Ras-ERK pathway generates ERK-threonine-phosphorylated Sam68 that in turn enhances inclusion of exon v5 of the CD44 pre-RNA (18.Matter N. Herrlich P. Konig H. Nature. 2002; 420: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Thus phosphorylation is an essential regulatory mechanism of the RNA-binding activity of Sam68. Recently elevated phosphorylation of Sam68 and its correlation to increased acetylation was reported in breast cancer cell lines Hs578T, MDA-435, and MDA-468 (19.Babic I. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3781-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), implying that tyrosine phosphorylation of Sam68 may be required for the invasiveness of these cancer cells. In fact, the involvement of Sam68 in tumor progression is supported by the finding that depletion of Sam68 is associated with neoplastic transformation (20.Liu K. Li L. Nisson P.E. Gruber C. Jessee J. Cohen S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40195-40201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, it was demonstrated that overexpression of Sam68 blocks cell cycle progression (21.Taylor S.J. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. BMC Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of the RNA binding-defective splice variant (Sam68ΔKH), but not wild-type Sam68 was shown to suppress cell growth (22.Barlat I. Maurier F. Duchesne M. Guitard E. Tocque B. Schweighoffer F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3129-3132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the targeted disruption of Sam68 in DT20 cells was shown to cause growth retardation (23.Li Q.H. Haga I. Shimizu T. Itoh M. Kurosaki T. Fujisawa J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which is inconsistent with earlier studies (20.Liu K. Li L. Nisson P.E. Gruber C. Jessee J. Cohen S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40195-40201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional studies are required to define the role of Sam68 in cell cycle progression. BRK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the classified BRK family tyrosine kinases that include Frk, Srm, and Src42A (24.Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Oncol. Res. 2003; 13: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). BRK contains an SH3, an SH2, a kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory tyrosine in a similar arrangement as Src family kinases, but lacks the myristoylation signal conserved within the Src family. We previously identified BRK as the first nuclear kinase that can phosphorylate Sam68 and negatively regulate its RNA-binding activity (3.Derry J.J. Richard S. Valderrama Carvajal H. Ye X. Vasioukhin V. Cochrane A.W. Chen T. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6114-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and recently showed that both the Sam68-like proteins, SLM-1 and SLM-2, are also substrates of BRK (25.Haegebarth A. Heap D.

Other substrates of BRK comprise the adaptor proteins BKS (26.Mitchell P.J. Sara E.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4273-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and paxillin (27.Chen H.Y.

Furthermore, BRK has been shown to associate with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, GAP-associated p65 protein (28.Vasioukhin V. Tyner A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14477-14482Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), erbB3/HER3 (29.Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Fry M.J. Crompton M.R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 1982-1991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). BRK is overexpressed in more than 65% of breast tumors (31.Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of BRK was shown to specifically suppress BRK expression, resulting in significant inhibition of the proliferation of the T-47D breast cancer cell line (32.Harvey A.J. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Besides, BRK was shown to potentiate the mitogenic effects of EGF stimulation (29.Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Fry M.J. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5471-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33.Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Dean C.J. Page M.J.

These studies indicate that BRK indeed has growth promoting activities and is able to stimulate cell cycle progression. Wild-type BRK is known to reside throughout the cell and the overexpression of Sam68 promotes its nuclear localization (25.Haegebarth A. Heap D. Bie W. Derry J.J. Richard S. Tyner A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54398-54404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The nuclear expression of BRK occurs in normal prostate epithelial cells as well as in 70% of benign prostate hyperplasia, but not in high grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (34.Derry J.J. Prins G.S. Ray V. Tyner A.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4212-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that both BRK and Sam68 reside in Sam68 nuclear bodies (SNBs), a novel nuclear structure that we discovered in 1999 (35.Chen T. Boisvert F.-M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3015-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Sam68 is clustered with 16 tyrosine residues, all potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. This region also harbors an unconventional nuclear localization signal (NLS) comprising the last 24 amino acids (420RPSLKAPPARPVKGAYREHPYGRY443) of the protein with tyrosine residues at positions 435, 440, and 443 (36.Ishidate T. Yoshihara S. Kawasaki Y. Roy B.C. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mapping the phosphorylated tyrosines in the C-terminal of Sam68 is challenging, as the tyrosine residues are often located in clusters. Besides, traditional tryptic mapping is hampered by the scarcity of lysine and arginine residues in the C terminus. We have overcome this problem by generating Sam68 phospho-specific antibodies. We demonstrate that BRK phosphorylates Sam68 on all three tyrosines in the NLS. We show that tyrosine 440 dictates the localization of Sam68, as mutating it to phenylalanine completely blocks nuclear localization. Our data also identify Sam68 as a downstream substrate of BRK in breast cancer cells in response to EGF treatment. We also show that Sam68 inhibits cell cycle progression, whereas BRK has a stimulatory effect on cell growth. Co-infection of Sam68 and BRK in astrocytes prevents cell cycle progression as fewer cells were able to transverse the S phase of the cell cycle compared with mock-infected cells. We propose that phosphorylation of Sam68 may be a repressor of BRK-induced cell cycle progression. Antibodies—Peptides comprising amino acids 432-443 containing 3 tyrosine residues in the C-terminal of Sam68 were synthesized at W. M. Keck Biotech Resource Center (New Haven, CT) and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma). Polyclonal antibodies were generated at Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory, Inc. (Canadensis, PA) by injecting New Zealand White rabbits with peptides. The following phospho-Sam68 antibodies were generated: anti-435pY (KGAY*REHPYGRY), anti-440pY (KGAYREHPY*GRY), and anti-443pY (KGAYREHPYGRY*). Polyclonal antibodies were affinity purified over the antigenic peptide coupled to Affi-Gel beads, eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and concentrated using Centricon columns (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The 9E10 anti-myc monoclonal antibody was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The anti-Sam68 polyclonal antibody AD-1 has been described previously (35.Chen T. Boisvert F.-M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3015-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Anti-BRK polyclonal antibodies (C-17) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-β-actin and anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) were from Sigma. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—ELISA plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with the indicated quantity of peptide in 50 μl of 50 mm carbonate buffer, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and blocked with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 5% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). Primary antibodies were diluted at 1:1000 in dilution buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% ovalbumin, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and added to the corresponding well followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The plate was washed extensively with PBS containing 0.1% Tween. Goat anti-rabbit antibodies covalently coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Cappel Laboratories, Durham, NC) were incubated at 1:1000 in dilution buffer at 37 °C for 15 min. The plate was washed and developed using BM Blue POD substrate (Roche Diagnostics) and quantitated using spectrophotometry at 405 nm. Expression Constructs—Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Sam68 was constructed previously by subcloning the EcoRI fragment of myc-Sam68 into pEGFP-C1 (35.Chen T. Boisvert F.-M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3015-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). GFP-Sam68 mutants were generated by PCR using the forward primer 5′-TCCTGCTGGAGTTCGTGACC-3′ and the following reverse primers: GGTGAATTCCTTTTATGCTCCCTTCACTGGCCTAGC (for Δ423-443); GGTGAATTCCTTTTAATAACGTCCATATGGGTGCTC (for 435Y-F); GGTGAATTCCTTTTAATAACGTCCAAATGGGTGCTC (for 440Y-F), and GGTGAATTCCTTTTAAAAACGTCCATATGGGTGCTC (for 443Y-F). The EcoRI site is underlined. Wild-type BRK and BRK-YF constructs in the vector pRcCMV (33.Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Dean C.J. Page M.J.

To introduce the myc epitope at the N termini, the constructs were digested with SmaI and XbaI to remove the BRK inserts. BRK inserts were then cloned into pcDNA3myc digested with EcoRI (blunt ended with Klenow large fragment) and XbaI. The resulting constructs were sequenced for verification. Myc-tagged BRK adenoviruses and Sam68 adenoviruses were constructed by first PCR amplification of the cDNAs encoding myc-tagged BRK YF (described above) and myc-tagged Sam68 described previously (35.Chen T. Boisvert F.-M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3015-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) using T7 primer and a reverse primer containing a BamHI overhang (5′-GGAAGATCTACCATGGTGTCTTGGGACA-3′). After digestion with BamHI, the fragment was cloned into the BglII site of pADTR5-K7-GFPq (37.Massie B. Couture F. Lamoureux L. Mosser D.D. Guilbault C. Jolicoeur P. Belanger F. Langelier Y. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These plasmids express myc-BRK and myc-Sam68 under the regulation of a tetracycline-inducible promoter and a second cassette that constitutively expresses GFP. The latter cassette serves as a marker for transduction. Wild-type c-Src was a gift from Stéphane A. Laporte (McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada) and has been previously described (38.Fessart D. Simaan M. Laporte S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were generated, purified, and titered as described previously (39.Pilotte J. Larocque D. Richard S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The following cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection: HeLa (CCL-2), MDA-231 (HTB-26), MDA-468 (HTB-132), and BT20 (HTB-19). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), and 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Protein Expression and Immunoprecipitation—The day before transfection, HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 105 cells per 22-mm2 coverslip (Fisher Scientific). The cells were transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were incubated on ice with the primary antibody for 1 h. Then 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry was added and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with constant end-over-end mixing. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with PBS. Protein samples were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using the anti-Sam68 antibodies, anti-phospho-Sam68 antibodies, anti-BRK, and anti-myc (9E10) antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using either goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (ICN Pharmaceuticals) and the chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (DuPont). Dephosphorylation of BRK-phosphorylated GFP-Sam68 by Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B)—Immunoprecipitated phosphorylated GFP-Sam68 on beads was washed twice with lysis buffer and once with PBS, drained, and incubated with 20 μl of PTP1B buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) and 1 μg/ml of recombinant PTP1B (R&D Systems) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis. Immunofluorescence on Cultured Cells and Tissue Array—HeLa cells were cultured directly on glass coverslips in a 6-well dish. Transfection of HeLa cells for immunofluorescence was achieved using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol using 2 μg of DNA. The cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS, pH 7.4, for 5 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. If the cells were to be visualized only for GFP, then the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with glycerol containing 3 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain the nuclei. If the cells required antibody staining, the permeabilized cells were first blocked with 10% calf serum (Hyclone) in PBS for 30 min, then incubated with the primary antibodies (1:200) for 1 h in PBS at room temperature. The cells were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:200) in PBS for 30 min. Goat anti-rabbit coupled to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) and goat anti-mouse coupled to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. The cells were washed again, mounted onto glass slides, and visualized with a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). LandMark™ High Density Breast Tissue MicroArray on slides (catalog number 3190) was purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). The tissue were permeabilized as described above and stained with the appropriate antibodies. RNA Interference and EGF Stimulation—BRK siRNAs purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) comprised a 19-base duplex RNA nucleotide sequences with two 3′ deoxythymidine residues (BRK siRNA, 5′-GGUGAUUUCUCGAGACAACTT-3′ and control, 5′-GGACACCAUCAAGUGUUCGTT-3′). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) twice at 24-h intervals as described (32.Harvey A.J. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cells were then stimulated at various time intervals with EGF at 100 ng/ml. Cell Cycle Analysis of Astrocytes—Primary cultures of astrocytes were generated from newborn rat brains as described by McCarthy and de Vellis (40.McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar). Proliferating astrocytes were infected for 24 h with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 50 of the indicated adenovirus (AdGFP control, AdSam68, AdBRK) co-expressing the transgene and GFP from two different promoters as described previously (37.Massie B. Couture F. Lamoureux L. Mosser D.D. Guilbault C. Jolicoeur P. Belanger F. Langelier Y. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Larocque D. Galarneau A. Liu H.N. Scott M. Almazan G. Richard S. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were either left untreated or pulsed for 14 h with 10 mm BrdUrd (Sigma). The BrdUrd-labeled cells were collected, fixed in 70% ethanol for 20 min, pelleted, denatured with 1 n HCl for 30 min at room temperature, and neutralized with NaBO4 (0.1 m). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS/bovine serum albumin/Tween 20, and incubated for 1 h with a monoclonal antibody to BrdUrd (Chemicon). This was followed by incubation with a Cy5-labeled secondary antibody to mouse (1:500, Molecular Probes), resuspended in PBS containing 10 μg/ml propidium iodide, and analysis by flow cytometry. The cells were analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For BrdUrd labeling on astrocytes cultured on coverslips, infected astrocytes were pulsed for 8 h with 10 mm BrdUrd (Sigma) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and visualized by immunofluorescence using an Alexa 546-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Generation of Sam68 Phospho-NLS-specific Antibodies—The nuclear localization of Sam68 is imposed, in part, by its NLS located at its C terminus between amino acids 420 and 443 (36.Ishidate T. Yoshihara S. Kawasaki Y. Roy B.C. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate whether any of the tyrosine residues within the Sam68 NLS are tyrosine phosphorylated, we raised phospho-specific antibodies against each tyrosine within this region (Fig. 1A). The peptides that were synthesized contained phosphorylated tyrosine 435 (α-435pY), 440 (α-440pY), or 443 (α-443pY) (Fig. 1A). The peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits to generate polyclonal antibodies. The serum was applied to a column containing the non-phosphorylated peptide coupled to beads and the flow-through subsequently affinity purified with the phosphorylated immunogenic peptide. By ELISA we determined that all 3 antibodies recognized the corresponding phosphorylated immunogenic peptide and not the unphosphorylated backbone peptide (supplemental Fig. S1). These findings demonstrate that we have successfully generated Sam68 phospho-NLS specific antibodies. BRK-phosphorylated Sam68 Is Recognized by New Anti-phospho-Sam68 Antibodies—Sam68 is the first substrate identified for BRK (3.Derry J.J. Richard S. Valderrama Carvajal H. Ye X. Vasioukhin V. Cochrane A.W. Chen T. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6114-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine whether tyrosines 435, 440, and 443 within the Sam68 NLS were phosphorylated by BRK, HeLa cells were transfected with Sam68 fused to the GFP to distinguish it in size from endogenous Sam68. An expression vector encoding GFP-Sam68 was transfected with or without constitutively active myc epitope-tagged BRKY447F (BRK YF) (Fig. 1B). Cell lysates from the vector control (lane 1), BRK YF alone (lane 2), GFP-Sam68 alone (lane 3), or GFP-Sam68 plus BRK YF (lane 4) were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with 4G10, 435pY, 440pY, 443pY, anti-GFP, anti-myc, and anti-actin antibodies. All phospho-specific antibodies including anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody, anti-435pY, -440pY, and -443pY antibodies recognized GFP-Sam68 when cotransfected with BRK YF (Fig. 1B, lane 4). When GFP-Sam68 was transfected without BRK YF, GFP-Sam68 was recognized weakly by 4G10, 435pY, 440pY, and 443pY (lane 3). These finding suggest that transfected GFP-Sam68 is phosphorylated endogenously at Tyr435, Tyr440, and Tyr440 in HeLa cells and this background phosphorylation has been observed previously with overexpressed myc-Sam68 in HeLa cells (7.Richard S. Yu D. Blumer K.J. Hausladen D. Olszowy M.W. Connelly P.A. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further delineate the pattern of phosphorylation of the three N-terminal tyrosines by BRK we used an immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting strategy with the various Sam68 phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 1C). We observed that Sam68 is simultaneously phosphorylated on Tyr435/Tyr440 (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 10), Tyr440/Tyr443 (Fig. 1C, lanes 6 and 12), and Tyr435/Tyr43 (data not shown) and that this phosphorylation was increased with BRK. These data suggest that BRK fully phosphorylates Sam68 tyrosine 435, 440, and 443 within the cell. To confirm that tyrosine residues are phosphorylated in GFP-Sam68, we subjected immunoprecipitates to dephosphorylation assays with recombinant PTP1B followed by immunoblotting with anti-Sam68"

By in vivo co-immunoprecipitation of mot-2 with p53 and its deletion mutants, we earlier mapped the mot-2-binding site of p53 to its carboxyl terminus 312-352 amino acid residues. In the present study we attempted to disrupt mot-2-p53 interactions by overexpression of short p53 carboxyl-terminal peptides. We report that p53 carboxyl-terminal peptides (amino acid residues 312-390, 312-352, 323-390, and 323-352) localize in the cytoplasm, whereas 312-322, 337-390, 337-352, and 352-390 locate mostly in the nucleus. Most interestingly, the cytoplasmically localizing p53 peptides harboring the residues 323-337 activated the endogenous p53 function by displacing it from p53-mortalin complexes and relocating it to the nucleus.

Since its first identification three decades ago, it has been studied widely and has been recognized as a most frequently mutated gene in a variety of cancers (2Levine A.J. Wu M.C. Chang A. Silver A.

Therefore, studies on the regulation of p53 function and its reactivation are extremely important for cancer therapeutics. p53 is synthesized in the cytoplasm and must translocate to the nucleus to exert its sequence-specific transcription factor function (9Vousden K.H. Woude G.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E178-E180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Transcriptional activation of p53 in the nucleus leads to the expression of MDM2 (one of its downstream regulators and antagonists) that results in its degradation by one or both of the following mechanisms: (i) physical export of p53 to the cytoplasm and its subsequent degradation by proteasome pathway; (ii) ubiquitination of p53 in the nucleus, unmasking of the nuclear export signal that favors its export from the nucleus, and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation (20Tao W.

In the present study, we report an activation of p53 function by overexpression of mortalin binding, cytoplasmically localizing the carboxyl terminus region peptides of p53. Plasmid Constructions—Full-length and deletion mutants of mouse p53 were obtained by PCR using p53-specific primers and cloned into the EYFPC1, EGFPC1 (Clontech), and pTOPO/V5 (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vectors. The integrity of the plasmids encoding various deletion mutant proteins was confirmed by sequencing. Proteins expressed in cells were visualized on a Carl Zeiss microscope and were also examined by Western blotting with GFP, V5, and mouse p53-specific antibodies. Cell Culture and Transfections—Human osteosarcoma (U2OS) or breast carcinoma (MCF7) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen). Typically, 3 μg of plasmid was used per 6-cm dish. After 24-48 h of transfection, protein expression was visualized by Western blotting or immunostaining as described below. Cell Fractionation—Transfected cells were harvested and fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions using a nuclear/cytosol fractionation kit from BioVision (Mountain View, CA). Protein (20 μg) from each fraction was resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western-blotted with anti-YFP antibody for detection of YFP-tagged p53 proteins. Immunoprecipitation and Immunodepletion—Cell lysates (600 μg) were incubated with anti-p53 polyclonal antibody for immunoprecipitation of an endogenous p53 protein as described (31Wadhwa R. Yaguchi T. Hasan M.K. Mitsui Y. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). p53 immunocomplexes were examined for the presence of mortalin by Western blotting with an anti-mortalin monoclonal antibody. Equal amounts of the lysate taken for immunoprecipitation were ensured by probing with an anti-actin antibody. For mortalin immunodepletion, lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-mortalin antibody for two rounds of precipitation. Supernatants were analyzed for endogenous p53 and YFP-p53 fragments by Western blotting with specific monoclonal anti-GFP and anti-p53 antibodies. Endogenous p53 was quantitated by image analysis software. Western Blotting—Cells transfected with various deletion mutants of mouse p53 were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). The protein concentration in cell lysate was determined by a standard dye binding assay (BioRad). 10 μg of total protein was resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan), and probed with anti-GFP, anti-p53, anti-histone H1, or anti-mortalin antibodies. Immunocomplexes were observed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Immunostaining—Cells were fixed with ice cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5 min and stained for endogenous p53 with a human p53-specific antibody (p53-DO1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mortalin with an anti-mortalin antibody (36Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Ikawa Y. Sugimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected YFP- or GFP-tagged mouse p53 proteins were visualized by their autofluorescence at the same time. The cells were examined on a Carl Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 200 m) in either conventional fluorescence or the ApoTome mode for high optical resolution attached to Photomerics Sensys and AxioCam MRm monochrome charge-coupled device cameras. The extent to which the two proteins overlapped was assessed by combining the two images using either Metamorph or AxioVison software. p53-dependent Reporter Assays—U2OS cells were stably transfected with the p53-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid PG-13luc (kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute)). Cells stably expressing a p53-dependent reporter were then transfected with expression plasmids encoding p53 deletion mutants. As a control, a pRL-TK vector (Promega) was co-transfected in each assay to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured by using the Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega). Results presented are the mean of three transfections. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfection of a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase. Luciferase activity was calculated per μg of protein and presented as the percent of activity with untransfected cells taken as 100%. Cell Growth Assays—The growth of U2OS cells was monitored by colony-forming assays. Transfected cells were selected by co-transfection of pPur plasmid and subsequent selection in puromycin-supplemented (2 μg/ml) medium for 48 h. Selected cells (1000) were plated in a 6-cm dish (in triplicate) and left to form colonies for the next 2 weeks with a regular change of medium every third day. Colonies were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution, photographed, and counted. Subcellular Localizations of GFP- and YFP-tagged Carboxyl-terminal Deletion Mutants of p53—Expression plasmids encoding GFP- or YFP-tagged full-length and various deletion mutants of murine p53 were constructed by PCR followed by cloning into the pEGFPC1 or pEYFPC1 vector (Fig. 1A). Cells transfected with expression plasmids were fixed and visualized under the microscope for the subcellular localization of the exogenous protein. The number of cells with purely nuclear, cytoplasmic, and predominantly nuclear p53 were counted (Fig. 1A). Based on the data, the constructs were divided into three groups as follows: (i) those encoding purely nuclear p53, i.e. YFP-p53 full protein (1-390 aa) and its carboxyl terminus-deleted mutant (1-322 aa); (ii) cytoplasmic p53, i.e. YFP-p53 (312-390, 312-352, 323-390, 323-352, and 323-337 aa); and (iii) predominantly nuclear p53 with some diffuse localization in the cytoplasm, i.e. 312-322, 337-390, 337-352, and 352-390 aa) (Fig. 1A). These data demonstrated the following findings. (i) The carboxyl terminus of p53 (323-390 aa) is responsible for its cytoplasmic localization. (ii) Amino acid residues 323-337 are required for its cytoplasmic localization. (iii) In the absence of 323-337 aa, the carboxyl terminal mutants locate to the nucleus (Fig. 1A). We also confirmed the presence of YFP-tagged p53 mutants in the cytoplasm or the nucleus by cell fractionation and Western blotting. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were probed with antibodies for resident marker proteins (mortalin for the cytoplasmic fraction and histone H1 for nuclear fraction). Similar to the cell visualization results, YFP-p53 full (1-390 aa) was nuclear, two mutants (323-352 and 312-352 aa) were mainly cytoplasmic (Fig. 1B), and one mutant (337-390 aa) was mainly nuclear with a small amount detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1B). Taken together with the above visualization data, p53 amino acid residues 323-337 seemed to be required for its cytoplasmic localization. Consistent with this finding, we had reported earlier (31Wadhwa R. Yaguchi T. Hasan M.K. Mitsui Y. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that p53 amino acid residues 312-352, but not 352-390, bind to mortalin in immunoprecipitation assays performed on cell lysates (free of subcellular compartments). Although the amino acid residues such as 312-322, 337-390, and 337-352 could also bind to mortalin in immunoprecipitation assays (31Wadhwa R. Yaguchi T. Hasan M.K. Mitsui Y. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), this might not happen in vivo because of their nuclear localization. Nuclear Translocation and Stabilization of Wild Type p53—We demonstrated earlier (31Wadhwa R. Yaguchi T. Hasan M.K. Mitsui Y. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Wadhwa R. Takano S. Robert M. Yoshida A. Reddel R.R. Nomura H. Mitsui Y. Kaul S.C. J. Biol.

Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that mortalin interacts with p53 and sequesters it in the cytoplasm. We next considered examining whether mortalin-binding small p53 peptides could compete with the endogenous p53 and abrogate its cytoplasmic sequestration from the mortalin-p53 complex, resulting in nuclear translocation of p53 (Fig. 1C). Such nuclear translocation would also lead to its stabilization and enhanced transcriptional activation function. As predicted, we found that the cells transfected with p53 fragments (323-390, 312-352, and 312-390) showed stabilization of endogenous p53. Of note, YFP by itself or fused to p53 fragment 1-30, 352-390, 337-390, or 337-352 was neutral (Fig. 2, A and B), Binding of p53 (fragments versus endogenous) to mortalin was examined by immunodepletion assays. Cell lysates immunodepleted with anti-mortalin antibody were examined for the presence of YFP-p53 and endogenous p53. As shown in Fig. 2C, lysates immunodepleted for mortalin showed a decrease in YFP-p53-(312-352) but not in YFP itself or YFP-p53-(352-390). Consistent with this result, the level of endogenous p53 was decreased by 5% in two rounds of mortalin immunoprecipitation (efficiency of immunoprecipitation is ∼5% in each round) in cells transfected with YFP or YFP-p53-(352-390). Of note, the level of endogenous p53 remained unchanged in cells expressing amino acid residues 312-352. The data supported the hypothesis that the mortalin-binding p53 fragment competed with the endogenous p53, resulting in its stabilization. We then assayed the p53 activity by p53-dependent reporter assays in cells stably transfected with PG13-Luc (p53-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid) (Fig. 2D). Consistent with our prediction and the data obtained as described above, cells expressing p53 fragments harboring amino acid residues 323-337 caused significant activation of p53 function. The mortalin-nonbinding p53 fragment was neutral. We also examined the effect of overexpression of mortalin in these assays. The cells expressing each of the two peptides that contained mortalin-binding region (312-352 and 312-390 aa) showed a decreased amount of mortalin in p53 immunocomplexes as compared with an empty vector control or the 352-390 peptide-transfected (devoid of mortalin-binding region) cells (c.f. lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 1 and 4 in Fig. 2, E and F). Most significantly, in mortalin-overexpressing cells the expression of p53 fragments (312-352 and 312-390 aa) did not cause a decrease in mortalin in p53 immunocomplexes. The data clearly showed that the mortalin-binding p53 peptides disrupt mortalin-p53 interactions by competing out the endogenous p53 from mortalin-p53 complexes as proposed in our model (Fig. 1C) and cause stabilization and activation of p53 function (Fig. 2, A-D). We next aimed to examine the nuclear translocation of endogenous p53 by direct visualization (Fig. 3A). Because the transfected protein was the murine p53, it was possible to distinguish the exogenous and endogenous (human) proteins by the use of a specific anti-p53 antibody that reacts only to the human protein. Transfected YFP-mouse p53 deletion mutants (Fig. 2A, bottom section) did not cross-react to the anti-human p53 antibody (Fig. 2A, top section). We next transfected the cells with YFP-tagged p53 deletion mutants and examined the intracellular localization of endogenous p53 by anti-p53 human-specific antibody (Fig. 3A). Time course observations were also taken subsequent to the transfection of 312-352 (mortalin-binding) and 352-390 (mortalin-nonbinding) aa fragments (Fig. 3B). We found that ∼90% of the cells transfected with p53 deletion mutants (312-352 and 323-352 aa, located in the cytoplasm) showed intense nuclear staining for endogenous p53 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, cells transfected with vector or the deletion mutants that locate in the nucleus (312-322, 337-390, 337-352 and 352-390 aa) (Fig. 1A) showed intense nuclear staining for p53 in ∼10% of the cells (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Vector transfectants also showed intense p53 staining in a small fraction of cells. Most likely, such variability in p53 levels may be due to the cell cycle stage. Nevertheless, the population of cells showing intense endogenous p53 staining was only 10% when transfected with nuclearly localizing p53 peptides as compared with 90% in the case of cells transfected with peptides localizing in the cytoplasm. Time course observations confirmed that the mortalin-binding p53 fragment could cause the translocation of endogenous p53 to the nucleus, whereas the mortalin-nonbinding fragment was neutral (Fig. 3B). We also performed Western analysis on nuclear fractions of p53 transfectants. The data confirmed that the p53 peptides such as 312-352 and 323-352 result in an increase in nuclear p53 (Fig. 3C). Similar to the data shown in Fig. 2B, peptide 323-390 was stronger than 312-352 and 312-390 in its p53-translocating function. Taken together, these data clearly showed that the small p53 peptides such as 323-352 and 323-390 that co-localize with mortalin (Fig. 3, D and E, and data not shown) competed with endogenous p53, disrupted mortalin-p53 binding, and resulted in translocation of the endogenous p53 protein to the nucleus as was expected in our model (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained in both U2OS and MCF7 cells. The data showed that the stabilization and activation of p53 function by p53 peptides involve nuclear translocation of endogenous p53. Sequence analysis of mortalin did not reveal any homology to the E3 family of ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases; it does not contain any of the three known motifs (U-box, Ring finger, and HECT) present in three families of E3 ligases. Therefore, it is likely that the cytoplasmic retention of p53 by mortalin enhances its degradation by the MDM2-mediated proteasome degradation pathway. Disruption of mortalin-p53 interactions in the cytoplasm by p53-peptides, as demonstrated above, caused translocation of endogenous p53 to the nucleus and thus protected it against the degradation in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C) as supported by an increase in the level of endogenous p53 and its activity (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). Furthermore, similar results were obtained (data not shown) when cells were transfected with MDM2 expression construct (driven by the MDM-2 promoter, a kind gift from Dr. Uri Alon, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) along with the p53 peptides such as 323-352 and 323-337 (but not 312-352), implying that the nuclear translocation of p53 caused by these p53 peptides (323-352 and 323-337) was effective in protecting it from MDM2-mediated degradation in the cytoplasm. Because nuclear translocation of endogenous p53 caused by the peptide 312-352 was disrupted by overexpression of MDM2, it is suggested that the peptide 312-352 is a weaker competitor than 323-352 or 323-337 in translocating the endogenous p53 to the nucleus and activating it. Of note, the data in Fig. 2B showing a higher level of endogenous p53 in cells transfected with peptide 323-390 than with 312-352 or 312-390 supported this finding. Taken together, these results suggest the following two points. (i) The p53 residues 312-322, which localize in the nucleus when present along with cytoplasmically localizing residues such as 323-352, disrupt their activity as a p53-binding antagonist to mortalin. (ii) The p53 peptide-induced activation of endogenous p53 in this study takes place by bypassing the MDM2 mediating degradation, at least in part. Activation of Wild Type p53 Function—We next investigated whether the activation of endogenous wild type p53 affects the growth of cells. MCF7 and U2OS cells transfected with cytoplasmically localizing p53 peptides showed delayed growth as compared with the vector-transfected cells. Of note, peptides 312-352 and 323-337 were strongly inhibitory (data not shown). Colony-forming assays were also performed in U2OS cells. Cells were transfected with p53 deletion mutants and selected by co-transfection of a puromycin resistance marker plasmid. The selected cells were subjected to colony-forming assays (Fig. 4A). Of note, whereas mortalin-binding p53 peptides (312-352 and 323-337) caused strong inhibition (53 and 76%, respectively), mortalin-nonbinding p53 peptides (312-322, 337-352, and 352-390) had only a weak effect (<20%) on the colony-forming efficiency of cells. Taken together, these data showed that the cytoplasmically localizing deletion mutants of p53 displaced endogenous p53 from mortalin-p53 complexes, resulting in its nuclear translocation and activation of growth arrest function. Functional inactivation of p53 is a very common characteristic of tumors (37Hainaut P. Soussi T. Shomer B. Hollstein M. Greenblatt M. Hovig E. Harris C.C. Montesano R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 38Hollstein M. Soussi T. Thomas G. von Brevern M.C. Bartsch H. Recent Results Cancer Res. 1997; 143: 369-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the mechanisms whereby this occurs include the following three main categories: (i) mutations of p53 that abrogate its DNA binding or transcriptional activation functions; (ii) abnormal expression of p53-interacting proteins, e.g. MDM2, that result in accelerated degradation of the wild type or stability of mutant p53; and (iii) nuclear exclusion of wild type p53 (22O'Brate A. Giannakakou P. Drug Resist. Updat. 2003; 6: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although the first two categories have been investigated intensively in the last decade, the third remains poorly understood. The functional domains of p53 include an amino terminus transactivation domain, a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain, a carboxyl terminus oligomerization/tetramerization domain, and a regulatory domain (39Harris C.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1442-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The intracellular localization of p53 has been shown to be determined by nuclear localization signals, single amino acid residues such as Leu305, Arg306, and Ser315, nuclear export signals (18Stommel J.M.

As expected, the deletion mutants that retained NLS localized in the nucleus (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, amino acid residues 323-337 by themselves or with extended C terminus (323-390 and 323-352 aa) localized almost exclusively in the cytoplasm; the deletion mutants lacking amino acid residues 323-337, e.g. 337-390 and 337-352 aa) localized in the nucleus. In vivo activation of p53 by small molecule antagonists of MDM2 that inhibit the interactions of p53 and MDM2 was shown (42Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N.

Mutant mice with an allele coding for carboxy-terminal p53 fragment showed enhanced resistance to spontaneous tumors and early onset of aging phenotypes (43Tyner S.D. Venkatachalam S. Choi J.

Nature. 2002; 415: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), providing evidence for the overactivation of wild type p53 function by carboxyl terminal p53. We have reported here that the overexpression of mortalin-binding, cytoplasmically localizing carboxyl-terminal p53 peptides harboring amino acid residues 323-337 disrupts mortalin-p53 complexes, resulting in nuclear translocation and significant functional activation of wild type p53. These findings may be adopted for therapeutics of tumors with wild type but inactive p53."
https://openalex.org/W2076930068,"Production of NADPH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown on glucose has been attributed to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf1p) and a cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald6p) (Grabowska, D., and Chelstowska, A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 13984–13988). This was based on compensation by overexpression of Ald6p for phenotypes associated with ZWF1 gene disruption and on the apparent lethality resulting from co-disruption of ZWF1 and ALD6 genes. However, we have found that a zwf1Δald6Δ mutant can be constructed by mating when tetrads are dissected on plates with a nonfermentable carbon source (lactate), a condition associated with expression of another enzymatic source of NADPH, cytosolic NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idp2p). We demonstrated previously that a zwf1Δidp2Δ mutant loses viability when shifted to medium with oleate or acetate as the carbon source, apparently because of the inadequate supply of NADPH for cellular antioxidant systems. In contrast, the zwf1Δald6Δ mutant grows as well as the parental strain in similar shifts. In addition, the zwf1Δald6Δ mutant grows slowly but does not lose viability when shifted to culture medium with glucose as the carbon source, and the mutant resumes growth when the glucose is exhausted from the medium. Measurements of NADP(H) levels revealed that NADPH may not be rapidly utilized in the zwf1Δald6Δ mutant in glucose medium, perhaps because of a reduction in fatty acid synthesis associated with loss of Ald6p. In contrast, levels of NADP+ rise dramatically in the zwf1Δidp2Δ mutant in acetate medium, suggesting a decrease in production of NADPH reducing equivalents needed both for biosynthesis and for antioxidant functions. Production of NADPH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown on glucose has been attributed to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf1p) and a cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald6p) (Grabowska, D., and Chelstowska, A.

Reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH are required for numerous biosynthetic enzymatic reactions and antioxidant mechanisms involving glutathione and/or thioredoxin. The major cellular source of NADPH is thought to be the hexose monophosphate pathway. However, disruption of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ZWF1 gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in that pathway, was found to produce relatively mild growth phenotypes including methionine auxotrophy and an increased sensitivity to exogenous oxidizing agents like hydrogen peroxide (1Nogae I.

In studies designed to identify other crucial sources of NADPH in yeast, co-disruption of ZWF1 and the gene (IDP2) encoding cytosolic NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase was found to produce a rapid loss in cell viability following shifts from medium containing glucose to medium containing either oleate or acetate as the carbon source (3Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3402-3406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 832-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This loss of viability correlated with an increase in levels of endogenous cellular oxidants. Fatty acid metabolism requires rapid flux through β-oxidation, a peroxisomal process in yeast that produces hydrogen peroxide in the first reaction of each cycle (5Hiltunen J.K. Mursula A.M. Rottensteiner H. Wierenga R.K. Kastaniotis A.J. Gurvits A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 35-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 6Kunau W-H. Dommes V. Schultz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and acetate is a stringent carbon source that produces rapid flux through mitochondrial respiration, a process associated with the generation of deleterious reactive oxidative species (7Bertlett B.S.

Med. 2002; 33: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These results suggested that Zwf1p and Idp2p are essential sources of NADPH for thiol-dependent antioxidant functions needed to eliminate detrimental byproducts of oxidative metabolism. Zwf1p expression in yeast is essentially constitutive (1Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y.

In contrast, Idp2p levels are repressed by growth on glucose, elevated with growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, and induced during the diauxic shift as glucose is depleted in the medium (9Minard K.I.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In a search for alternative sources of NADPH in cells grown on glucose, Grabowska and Chelstowska (12Grabowska D. Chelstowska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13984-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) found the ALD6 gene encoding cytosolic NADP+-specific acetaldehyde dehydrogenase to be a multicopy suppressor of the Met– phenotype of a zwf1Δ strain. They also reported that a zwf1Δald6Δ mutant is not viable and concluded that Ald6p is essential for production of NADPH in the absence of Zwf1p. The conclusion that the zwf1Δald6Δ mutant is not viable (12Grabowska D. Chelstowska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13984-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was based on the failure of various strategies involving mating and sporulation to obtain this mutant. However, because those experiments were conducted exclusively on glucose medium when Idp2p is not expressed, we postulated that a zwf1Δald6Δ mutant might be viable if a carbon source conducive for Idp2p expression was utilized during construction. Here we describe construction of the zwf1Δald6Δ mutant strain and evaluation of the roles of Zwf1p, Idp2p, and Ald6p as enzymatic sources of NADPH. Cultivation Conditions—Yeast strains were cultivated on 2% agar plates or in liquid culture with rich YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone) or with minimal YNB medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, pH 6.5). Supplements (including methionine for zwf1Δ mutants) of 20 μg/ml were added to minimal medium to satisfy auxotrophic requirements or withheld to select for transformants or diploids. Glucose or lactate as the carbon source was added to 2%. Yeast Strain Constructions—Yeast strains used in this study were isogenic parental haploid MATa and MATα strains (leu2–3,112 his3–1 ura3–57 trp1–289; see Ref. 13Botstein D. Falco S.C. Stewart S.E. Brennan M. Scherer S. Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and previously constructed mutants of these strains containing deletions and URA3 disruption insertions in the IDP2 or ZWF1 loci (9Minard K.I.

Phillipsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar) was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotides (5′-CTATCAGAATACAATGACTAAGCTACACTTTGACACTGCTGAACCAGTCCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC and 5′-CTTAATTCTGACAGCTTTTACTTCAGTGTATGCATGGTAGACTTCTTCATCGATGAATTCCAGCTCG) containing sequences from the 5′- and 3′-regions of the ALD6 coding sequence (underlined). The resulting ∼1.5-kbp DNA fragment was used for targeted gene disruptions in each parental haploid strain and in a MATa strain containing a URA3 disruption of IDP2 (9Minard K.I. Jennings G.T.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Disruption of the ALD6 locus in Kanr transformants was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of EcoRI and EcoRV digests of genomic DNA using radiolabeled probes generated by PCR from ALD6 and kan genes. Disruptions of IDP2 and ZWF1 loci were confirmed by Southern blots, immunochemical analyses, and enzyme assays of cellular protein extracts as described previously (3Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3402-3406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Minard K.I. Jennings G.T. Loftus T.M. Xuan D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For construction of a zwf1Δald6Δ strain, a MATa ald6::kan strain was mated with a MATα zwf1::URA3 strain (9Minard K.I. Jennings G.T. Loftus T.M. Xuan D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31486-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Matings, sporulation, and tetrad dissections were conducted as described by Adams et al. (15Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 19-29Google Scholar) except that tetrads were dissected on YP plates containing 2% lactate as the carbon source. A haploid MATα zwf1Δald6Δ strain obtained from this mating was mated with a MATa idp2::URA3 strain (9Minard K.I. Jennings G.T. Loftus T.M. Xuan D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31486-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Resulting tetrads were similarly dissected in attempts to construct a haploid zwf1Δald6Δidp2Δ strain. Analyses of Growth Phenotypes—To analyze effects on viability following carbon source shifts, parental and mutant strains were cultivated overnight in YP medium with 2% lactate as the carbon source. Cells were harvested, washed, and diluted at time 0 to an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) = 0.3 in YP medium with 0.1% oleate plus 0.2% Tween 40, with 2% sodium acetate or 2% glucose as the carbon source. Viable cell numbers were tabulated daily by plating cells on YP lactate plates and counting colonies after 7 days of incubation at 30 °C. Measurements of glucose levels in culture medium were conducted according to instructions for a Sigma diagnostic kit (catalog no. 510-A). Standards were various concentrations (0–2 mg/ml) of glucose in YP medium. The limit of detection was ∼0.1 mg glucose/ml medium. Plate assays for sensitivity to exogenous hydrogen peroxide were conducted by streaking colonies onto YP glucose or ethanol plates containing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide ranging from 0 to 5 mm. Colony size and numbers were evaluated after 7 days of incubation at 30 °C. Enzyme Assays and Immunoblot Analysis—Cellular lysates were prepared for activity assays and denaturing gel electrophoresis by breaking cell pellets with glass beads (11Loftus T.M. Hall L.V. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9661-9667Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16McAlister-Henn L. Thompson L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford dye binding assay (17Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). Assays for NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase activity (expressed as μmol of NADPH formed per min/mg of protein) were conducted as described previously (18Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2339-2345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes was conducted using an antiserum originally prepared against the purified mitochondrial isozyme (19Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12116-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive polypeptides were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescent method (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography. NADP(H) Measurements—Enzymatic cycling reactions to measure concentrations of NADP+ and NADPH in cellular extracts were conducted essentially as described by Passonneau and Lowry (20Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 1-110Google Scholar) using conditions for spectrophotometric determination. These cycling reactions amplify levels of cofactor in small extract samples and thus minimize effects of inhibitors that might interfere with direct enzymatic assays of larger extract volumes. Parental and mutant strains were subjected to media shifts as described above. At times before and following shifts, cell samples were taken to measure A600 values and viable cell numbers. Two aliquots of cells, each representing A600 = 1.0 (∼107 cells), were used to prepare an acid extract to measure NADP+ and an alkaline extract to measure NADPH (21Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36000-36007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Lin S-J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Cycling reactions to amplify levels of NADP(H) were conducted at 37 °C for 4 h. Final concentrations of NADPH were determined spectrophotometrically at A340 nm by comparison with standard curves conducted with cycling reactions using NADP+ and NADPH in concentrations ranging from 0 to 150 nm. Various amounts (2–20 μl) of each cellular extract were used in cycling reactions to produce at least four values within the linear portion of the standard curves. Final experimental values represent averages of such values from at least three independent media shift experiments. Construction of a zwf1Δald6Δ Mutant—Because previous attempts to obtain a zwf1Δald6Δ mutant strain using methods employing glucose as the carbon source were unsuccessful (12Grabowska D. Chelstowska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13984-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we attempted to construct this strain by mating and sporulation on plates containing a nonfermentable carbon source. For this, we used kanamycin cassette mutagenesis (14Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Phillipsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2248) Google Scholar) to replace the ALD6 coding region in a haploid yeast strain and confirmed the disruption by Southern blot analysis. This strain was mated with an isogenic strain of opposite mating type containing a URA3 disruption in the coding region of ZWF1 (9Minard K.I. Jennings G.T. Loftus T.M. Xuan D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31486-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Tetrads were dissected on YP plates containing 2% lactate as the carbon source. The Ura+ and Kanr markers segregated independently as expected based on the location of ALD6 and ZWF1 genes on different chromosomes. 2Saccharomyces genome database (www.yeastgenome.org). In addition, haploid Ura+Kanr zwf1Δald6Δ mutants were obtained at the expected frequency in tetrads dissected on YP lactate plates. Upon replating, the zwf1Δald6Δ mutants were found to grow well but at slightly reduced rates relative to parental strains on YP plates containing 2% glycerol, lactate, ethanol, or acetate. The mutants did not grow after 7 days on plates containing 2% glucose as expected based on the report by Grabowska and Chelstowska (12Grabowska D. Chelstowska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13984-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, zwf1Δald6Δ mutants are viable when constructed and grown on nonfermentable carbon sources. We also constructed a haploid idp2Δald6Δ strain by transformation of an idp2Δ strain with the ALD6 kanamycin disruption cassette. In plate tests, we observed no growth phenotypes for the idp2Δald6Δ strain other than the slow growth on minimal ethanol medium reported previously for an ald6Δ strain (24Meaden P.G. Dickinson F.M. Mifsud A. Tessier W. Westwater J. Bussey H. Midgley M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, Idp2p and Ald6p do not appear to have essential overlapping functions. Finally, we attempted to construct a zwf1Δald6Δidp2Δ strain by mating haploid zwf1Δald6Δ and idp2Δ strains and by sporulation of diploids on YP lactate plates. However, many of the tetrads from this mating contained only two or three spores. Analysis of the viable spores by tests for Ura+ and Kanr markers and by Southern blot analysis indicated that mutants containing one or any two of the gene disruptions could be obtained from this mating. However, haploid mutants containing all three gene disruptions were not identified, suggesting that such strains may not be viable. Sources of NADPH for Antioxidant Functions—To examine the relative contributions of Zwf1p, Idp2p, and Ald6p as sources of NADPH in protection from endogenous metabolic oxidants, the ald6Δ and double gene disruption strains (zwf1Δald6Δ; idp2Δald6Δ; zwf1Δidp2Δ) (Ref. 9Minard K.I. Jennings G.T. Loftus T.M. Xuan D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31486-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were shifted from permissive YP lactate medium to YP oleate or YP acetate medium. As shown in Fig. 1, the parental strain (•) grows well, whereas numbers of viable zwf1Δidp2Δ cells (▿) decrease after 24 h on the new carbon sources. We reported previously (3Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3402-3406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 832-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that the decrease in viability of the zwf1Δidp2Δ strain following shifts to oleate or acetate medium is coincidental with an increase in levels of cellular oxidants and is presumably due to the loss of critical sources of NADPH needed for cellular antioxidant systems. Both Idp2p and Zwf1p contribute to this function because no loss in viability was observed in similar shifts of mutants lacking only one of these enzymes (3Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3402-3406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast to the zwf1Δidp2Δ strain, none of the mutant strains lacking Ald6p, importantly including the zwf1Δald6Δ strain (▪), show any impairment of growth on oleate or acetate (Fig. 1). This suggests that Ald6p is not a crucial source of NADPH for protection from endogenous oxidants generated by peroxisomal β-oxidation on oleate medium or by rapid mitochondrial respiration on acetate medium. To examine the relative roles of enzymatic sources of NADPH in protection from exogenous oxidants, we compared the growth of parental and mutant strains on YP glucose or ethanol plates containing increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (TABLE ONE). With glucose as the carbon source, as reported previously (1Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 3Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3402-3406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), loss of Zwf1p (in the zwf1Δ strain or in the zwf1Δ idp2Δ strain) increases sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. The inability of the zwf1Δ ald6Δ strain to grow on YP glucose plates precluded analysis of relative sensitivity. With ethanol as the carbon source (TABLE ONE), the parental strains are resistant to 3.0 mm hydrogen peroxide, as are the ald6Δ or idp2Δ mutant strains. In comparison, the zwf1Δ strain fails to grow on ethanol plates containing 2.0 mm hydrogen peroxide. As we reported previously (3Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3402-3406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 832-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), co-disruption of the ZWF1 and IDP2 genes produces an increase in sensitivity to this exogenous oxidant at 2 mm concentrations. Co-disruption of the ZWF1 and ALD6 genes also slightly increases sensitivity relative to disruption of ZWF1 alone.TABLE ONEGrowth phenotypes with exogenous hydrogen peroxideStrainGlucoseEthanol0 mm H2O23.0 mm H2O24.0 mm H2O25.0 mm H2O20 mm H2O21.0 mm H2O22.0 mm H2O23.0 mm H2O24.0 mm H2O2Parental MATa++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-Parental MATα+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-ald6Δ+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-idp2Δ+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-zwf1Δ++++++--++++++++---ald6Δidp2Δ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-zwf1Δidp2Δ++++++--++++++---zwf1Δald6Δ----+++++++--- Open table in a new tab Collectively, these results suggest a primary role for Zwf1p in resistance to exogenous hydrogen peroxide. However, with endogenous oxidants produced as by-products of metabolic pathways, Idp2p also has a critical antioxidant function. Viability of a zwf1Δald6Δ Mutant in Cultures with Glucose as the Carbon Source—Because the zwf1Δald6Δ mutant does not grow on glucose plates, we also examined the viability of this strain following a culture shift from permissive YP lactate medium to YP glucose medium. As shown in Fig. 2A, the zwf1Δald6Δ strain (○) shows very little initial growth relative to the parental strain (•), doubling only 1.5 times in 48 h. Importantly, however, there is no indication of a loss of viability during this time, suggesting that the early slow growth of the zwf1Δald6Δ strain does not involve metabolic toxicity. At the 72 h and 96 h time points, growth rates of the zwf1Δald6Δ strain increase substantially. In other experiments (data not shown), we found that using lower initial A600 values during the shift to glucose medium similarly delayed the logarithmic growth phase of the parental strain and extended the period of slow growth of the zwf1Δald6Δ strain, again with no apparent effects on cell viability. Similar results were obtained following shifts of the parental and zwf1Δald6Δ strains to minimal medium with glucose. The patterns of glucose utilization by these strains (Fig. 2B) suggest that glucose is essentially depleted in the parental strain culture within 12 h following the shift; the rate of glucose utilization was ∼0.77 mg/h between the 0 and 12 h time points. The zwf1Δald6Δ strain exhibits a much slower rate of glucose metabolism, ∼0.06 mg/h between the 12 and 72 h time points, with depletion in the medium observed only after 96 h of cultivation. Because the zwf1Δald6Δ strain does eventually grow in these liquid cultures, we assume that the inability of this strain to grow on YP glucose plates, as described above, is due to inadequate depletion of glucose on the plate surface and/or inadequate oxygenation relative to shaking flask cultures. We examined immunochemical levels of Idp2p (Fig. 3A, lower band) in these strains using an antiserum that also recognizes mitochondrial NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (Fig. 3A, upper band). In contrast to Idp2p, expression of the mitochondrial enzyme is essentially constitutive with various carbon sources (18Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2339-2345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Haselbeck R.J. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12116-12122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also measured total cellular NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 3B). In the parental strain, the effect of glucose repression of immunochemical levels of Idp2p (Fig. 3A) is obvious in a comparison of samples taken before (lane 1) and 12 h after (lane 2) the shift to glucose medium, and Idp2p levels are again elevated (lanes 3–6) following the logarithmic stage of growth (see Fig. 2), i.e. as glucose is depleted during the diauxic shift. Changes in levels of Idp2p in the parental strain are also reflected in the transient decrease in total cellular activity 12 h following the shift (Fig. 3B, •) and in the subsequent recovery of activity to the preshift level. For the zwf1Δald6Δ strain, immunochemical levels of Idp2p (Fig. 3A) remain repressed during the period of slow growth following the shift to glucose medium (lanes 2–5 relative to lane 1) and are elevated to parental strain levels at the 96 h time point (lane 6) as glucose is depleted (see Fig. 2). Again, there are corresponding changes in total cellular activity (Fig. 3B, ○). Thus, Idp2p levels are elevated in the zwf1Δald6Δ strain during growth on lactate medium and as glucose levels are reduced at late time points following the culture shift to glucose medium. Changes in Levels of NADP(H) during Carbon Source Shifts—We measured levels of NADP(H) as described under “Experimental Procedures” to directly examine correlations between these levels and the loss of viability of a zwf1Δidp2Δ strain following a shift to acetate medium or with the lag in growth of a zwf1Δald6Δ strain following a shift to glucose medium. Parental and zwf1Δidp2Δ strains were shifted from glucose to acetate medium as described above. Samples taken at various times were used to calculate viable cell numbers and to prepare extracts for measurement of NADP(H) levels (Fig. 4). Prior to the acetate shift, extracts from the parental strain precultivated in glucose medium exhibited levels of NADP+ ∼2-fold higher than those of NADPH (time 0 in Fig. 4). Following the shift to acetate medium, levels of NADP+ (▾) were slightly reduced (by ∼40%) over the 72-h period, whereas NADPH levels (▪) fell by 4-fold in 24 h and remained low. A ratio of [NADP+]:[NADPH] of ∼6 (Fig. 4B, •) was attained 24 h following the shift and maintained throughout growth to 72 h. For the zwf1Δidp2Δ strain, levels of NADP+ and NADPH in viable cells were approximately equal prior to the shift (time 0 in Fig. 4), and following the shift to acetate medium, levels of NADPH (□) dropped in a manner similar to those in the parental strain. In contrast to the parental strain, levels of NADP+ in the mutant (▿) rose dramatically after 24 h to ∼5-fold the starting value by 72 h, producing a ∼25-fold increase in the ratio of [NADP+]:[NADPH] (Fig. 4B, ○). These results suggest induction of a mechanism in viable zwf1Δidp2Δ cells to produce more NADP+ perhaps to compensate for the decreased rate of conversion of oxidized to reduced cofactor. Parental and zwf1Δald6Δ strains were similarly shifted from lactate to glucose medium. Levels of NADP(H) were determined and expressed relative to total cell number in this case (Fig. 5) because both strains remain viable during this shift. Levels of NADP+ in the parental strain precultivated in lactate medium exceeded those of NADPH by ∼3.4-fold (time 0 in Fig. 5). Following the shift to glucose medium, levels of both NADP+ and NADPH exhibited a transient increase at 12 h (Fig. 5A), a time corresponding to logarithmic growth and rapid utilization of glucose by the parental strain (Fig. 2), and then declined to near preshift levels after 24 h. The overall ratio of [NADP+]:[NADPH] declined steadily to ∼1.7 at 48 h (Fig. 5B, •). NADPH levels were below detection in parental strain extracts after this time, which corresponds with stationary phase growth (Fig. 2), precluding estimates of the nucleotide ratio at later time points. The general patterns of changes in levels of NADP+ and NADPH in the zwf1Δald6Δ strain shifted from lactate to glucose (Fig. 5A) were quite similar to those for the parental strain, although the peak in the transient increase in levels of both was delayed to 24 h. Also, the ratio of [NADP+]:[NADPH] remained fairly constant (∼2.2–2.5) (Fig. 5B, ○) before and after the shift. The lowest ratio value was obtained 96 h following the shift, a time corresponding to rapid growth of the mutant strain and to depletion of glucose in the medium (Fig. 2). These observations suggest that the dramatic increases in NADP+ levels and in the ratio of [NADP+]:[NADPH] in the zwf1Δidp2Δ mutant are closely correlated with the loss of viability observed upon a shift of this strain to acetate medium. In contrast, there appears to be little correlation between differences in NADP(H) levels or ratios and the slow growth observed for the zwf1Δald6Δ strain shifted from lactate to glucose medium. We have demonstrated that construction of a haploid zwf1Δald6Δ mutant is feasible when haploid yeast strains containing the individual gene disruptions are mated, and tetrads from resulting diploids are sporulated on plates containing lactate as the carbon source. In concurrence with a previous report (12Grabowska D. Chelstowska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13984-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we were unable to obtain the zwf1Δald6Δ mutant by sporulation of diploids on glucose plates, and the haploid zwf1Δald6Δ mutant obtained on lactate plates failed to grow when transferred to glucose plates. Grabowska and Chelstowska (12Grabowska D. Chelstowska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13984-13988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that multicopy expression of Ald6p or Zms1p, a putative transcriptional regulator of ALD6 expression, can suppress phenotypes associated with ZWF1 disruption. A recent report (25Butcher R.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7868-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggests additional roles for Ald6p and Zwf1p in protection of yeast from salt stress, a calcineurin-mediated response examined using YP glucose medium containing high concentrations of NaCl or LiCl. Thus, Zwf1p and Ald6p do appear to have an essential overlapping function, presumably production of NADPH, but our results suggest that this function is limited to growth with a fermentable carbon source. Our results also suggest that production of NADPH may not be the sole reason for the glucose– phenotype of the zwf1Δald6Δ strain because levels of reduced cofactor are quite similar in parental and mutant strains following a shift to glucose medium (Fig. 5). Another important function of Ald6p during growth on glucose is provision of acetate as a precursor of cytosolic acetyl-CoA for fatty acid biosynthesis (26Saint-Prix F. Bönquist L. Dequin S. Microbiology (Read.). 2004; 150: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Slow rates of fatty acid synthesis in the zwf1Δald6Δ strain on glucose medium could directly limit growth and substantially reduce utilization of NADPH reducing equivalents that support fatty acid synthesis. This would reduce rates of interconversion of NADPH and NADP+, which, in fact, is what we observe. The ratio of [NADP+]: [NADPH] drops in the parental strain following a shift from lactate to glucose medium but remains essentially unchanged in the zwf1Δald6Δ mutant strain (Fig. 5B). In yeast cells grown on a nonfermentable carbon source or following the diauxic shift on glucose, expression of other enzymatic sources of NADPH including Idp2p is induced (9Minard K.I. Jennings G.T. Loftus T.M. Xuan D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31486-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have shown that a culture of the zwf1Δald6Δ mutant exhibits little growth when initially shifted from lactate to glucose medium. However, the mutant retains viability and slowly metabolizes the glucose, permitting the onset of diauxic growth once the glucose is depleted. An interesting correlation is that levels of Idp2p in the zwf1Δald6Δ strain increase at the time growth resumes following the exhaustion of glucose (Figs. 2 and 3). However, we note that numerous other proteins, including mitochondrial Ald4p (27Jacobson M.K. Bernofsky C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 350: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), that might compensate for the loss of Ald6p in producing NADPH are also induced during the diauxic shift. Ald4p and mitochondrial Ald5p, which is induced under anaerobic conditions in the stationary phase (26Saint-Prix F. Bönquist L. Dequin S. Microbiology (Read.). 2004; 150: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), can both produce NADPH. However, it is unclear whether this pool of NADPH would be available for cytosolic biosynthetic reactions. Another possibility is suggested by a recent report (26Saint-Prix F. Bönquist L. Dequin S. Microbiology (Read.). 2004; 150: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that Ald5p can compensate for loss of Ald6p in acetate formation. Presumably, induction of Ald4p expression during the diauxic shift and on nonfermentable carbon sources would also increase acetate production for fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, once glucose is metabolized in the medium, there is an increase in the levels of several proteins that can compensate for different Ald6p functions. In contrast to the relatively minor effects on levels of NADP(H) in the zwf1Δald6Δ mutant shifted to nonpermissive glucose medium, we observed dramatic effects in the zwf1Δidp2Δ mutant shifted to nonpermissive acetate medium (Fig. 4). Although the levels of NADPH decreased to similar levels in the parental strain, the zwf1Δidp2Δ strain exhibited a dramatic increase in cellular levels of NADP+. This suggests that the reduction of available cofactor may be inefficient in the mutant strain, as would be predicted by loss of the two major enzymatic mechanisms for NADP+ reduction. It also suggests some compensatory mechanism in the stressed mutant cells for dramatically increasing cellular concentrations of NADP+. The most proximal source of NADP+ in yeast cells is NAD+. Three NAD+ kinases have been identified, and all were recently shown to be competent for ATP-dependent phosphorylation of either NAD+ or NADH (29Shi F. Kawai S. Mori S. Kono E. Murata K. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3337-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of these kinases, Utr1p (30Kawai S. Suzuki S. Mori S. Murata K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 200: 181-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been genetically linked with Ald6p, and mutants lacking either protein exhibit similar changes in transcriptional profiles (25Butcher R.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7868-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It will be of interest in future studies to examine the role of Utr1p and the other NAD+ kinases not only in the dramatic increase in NADP+ concentrations observed for the zwf1Δidp2Δ mutant following a shift to acetate medium (Fig. 4) but also, in addition, in the transient increase in NADP(H) levels observed in both parental and zwf1Δald6Δ strains following a shift to glucose medium (Fig. 5). Loss of both Ald6p and Zwf1p reduces growth rates on glucose medium but does not dramatically affect growth on nonfermentable carbon sources (Fig. 1). In addition, we find no evidence for metabolic damage causing loss of viability of zwf1Δald6Δ cells in glucose medium. In contrast, Idp2p appears to be the crucial adjunct to Zwf1p in providing NADPH both for active growth in the absence of glucose and for prevention of endogenous toxicity during growth on nonfermentable carbon sources like oleate and acetate. These differences may be due to the relatively low levels of metabolic oxidants in cells growing on glucose versus in cells growing on a fatty acid or acetate because metabolism of the latter carbon sources requires rapid flux through oxidative pathways. Thus, NADPH may be required primarily for biosynthetic reactions in cells grown on glucose, but in cells grown on nonfermentable carbon sources, these reducing equivalents are apparently needed both for biosynthesis and thiol-based antioxidant systems. It is interesting that these important sources of NADPH for biosynthesis and antioxidant functions are cytosolic enzymes. For example, we have found no related phenotype associated with loss of the mitochondrial NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (9Minard K.I. Jennings G.T. Loftus T.M. Xuan D. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31486-31493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the peroxisomal yeast isozyme functions quite specifically to provide NADPH for a particular enzymatic step in β-oxidation (31Henke B. Girzalsky W. Berteaux-Lecellier V. Erdmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3702-3711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32van Roermund C.W. Hettema E.H. Kal A.J. van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Malic enzyme, which is another critical cytosolic source of NADPH in mammalian cells, is mitochondrial in yeast (33Boles E. de Jong-Gubbels P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2875-2882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and loss of this enzyme has not been correlated with phenotypes associated with oxidative stress. 3K. I. Minard and L. McAlister-Henn, unpublished data. It is also of interest that the thiol-related antioxidant systems dependent on NADPH generated by Zwf1p and Idp2p appear to be more important than the peroxidative enzymes in the removal of the deleterious byproducts of normal metabolic pathways. This is based on finding no detrimental effects following the shifts of mutants lacking cytosolic catalase and/or mitochondrial cytochrome c peroxidase to medium with oleate or acetate as the carbon source (4Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 832-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Also, addition of dithiothreitol and/or glutathione to the medium was shown to partially compensate for the loss of Zwf1p and Idp2p during such shifts, i.e. by providing some protection against rapid lethality. Some aspects of our results can be correlated with important sources of NADPH in mammalian systems. Defects in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase produce hemolytic anemia in humans, presumably due primarily to an inadequate reducing environment for proper function of hemoglobin (reviewed in Ref. 34Beutler E. Blood Rev. 1996; 10: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In mammalian cell lines, elevation or reduction of levels of the homologue of IDP2 has been shown to respectively increase or decrease resistance to various oxidative stresses (35Lee S.M. Koh H.J. Park D.C. Song B.J. Huh T.L. Park J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and IDP2 has been shown to be important for fatty acid biosynthesis (36Koh H.J. Lee S.M. Son B.G. Lee S.H. Ryoo Z.Y. Chang K.T.

Unfortunately, however, although numerous pathologies, including the propensity for certain types of cancers and alcoholism, have been associated with various polymorphic forms of the 17 known human aldehyde dehydrogenases (reviewed in Refs. 23Sophos N.A. Vasiliou V. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar and 37Vasilou V. Pappa A. Petersen D.R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), the exact counterpart in this superfamily of yeast Ald6p is unknown. Also unknown are the impact of cytosolic localization of malic enzyme in mammalian cells and the roles of transhydrogenases, capable of interconverting NADH and NADPH, that are present in mammalian cells but not in yeast cells (28Rydstrom J.

To date, the best understood method for prokaryotic swimming employs the rotation of flagella. Here, we show that Spiroplasma, tiny helical bacteria that infect plants and insects, use a very different approach.

By measuring cell kinematics during free swimming, we find that propulsion is generated by the propagation of kink pairs down the length of the cell body. A processive change in the helicity of the body creates these waves and enables directional movement. The ability to swim freely in liquids is a hallmark of many biological organisms. For large organisms such as fish, snakes, and humans, forward motion is achieved predominantly through the use of inertial forces (Childress, 1981Childress S. Mechanics of swimming and flying. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England1981Crossref Google Scholar, Veneti et al., 2005Veneti Z. Bentley J.K. Koana T. Braig H.R. Hurst G.D. A functional dosage compensation complex required for male killing in Drosophila.Science. 2005; 307: 1461-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, for microorganisms, such as bacteria, the situation is very different. Inertial effects are small, so that a bacterium cannot rely on momentum, and movement is dominated by viscous forces. As a result, bacteria must swim using motions that are not time-symmetric in order to produce a net displacement (Ludwig, 1930Ludwig W. Z. Vgl. Physiol. 1930; 13: 397-504Google Scholar, Purcell, 1977Purcell E.M. Life at low Reynolds number.Am. J. Phys. 1977; 45: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, Taylor, 1951Taylor G. Analysis of the swimming of microscopic organisms.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A. 1951; 209: 447-461Crossref Google Scholar). Many swimming bacteria, such as Escherichia, Salmonella, and spirochetes, satisfy this requirement by making use of rotary motion: they spin helical flagella located on the outside or inside of the cell body (Charon and Goldstein, 2002Charon N.W. Goldstein S.F. Genetics of motility and chemotaxis of a fascinating group of bacteria: The spirochetes.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 47-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, non-flagellated bacteria, such as the mollicute Spiroplasma and the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus, swim without the use of these large appendages (Waterbury et al., 1985Waterbury J.B. Willey J.M. Franks D.G. Valois F.W. Watson S.W. A cyanobacterium capable of swimming motility.Science. 1985; 230: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Whitcomb, 1980Whitcomb R.F. The genus Spiroplasma.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 34: 677-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The strategies that these organisms use to swim remain unclear. Spiroplasmas, tiny gram-positive eubacteria that measure approximately 150 nm in width by a few microns in length, infect a wide range of plants and insects (Whitcomb, 1980Whitcomb R.F. The genus Spiroplasma.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 34: 677-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and references therein). They are unique among the wall-less bacteria of the class Mollicute in their ability to maintain a helical shape and swim in liquid media. Spiroplasma’s distinct morphology is defined by internal cytoskeletal filaments of a 55 kDa protein that assemble into a helical ribbon, termed the fibril ribbon (Townsend and Plaskitt, 1985Townsend R.

Nucleotide sequence of the spiroplasma citri fibril protein gene.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4353-4362PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results using cryo-electron tomography reveal a complicated intracellular organization involving the fibril ribbon as well as another helical structure, possibly the actin homolog MreB (Kurner et al., 2005Kurner J. Frangakis A.S. Baumeister W. Cryo-electron tomography reveals the cytoskeletal structure of spiroplasma melliferum.Science. 2005; 307: 436-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In Spiroplasma, swimming is thought to arise from whole-cell undulations brought about by contractile motions of the cytoskeleton (Berg, 2002Berg H.C. How spiroplasma might swim.J.

Translation, rotation, and flexing of cells have all been reported (Daniels et al., 1980Daniels M.J. Longland J.M. Gilbart J. Aspects of motility and chemotaxis in spiroplasmas.J. Gen.

Motility modes of spiroplasma melliferum bc3: A helical, wall-less bacterium driven by a linear motor.Mol.

Longland J.M. Gilbart J. Aspects of motility and chemotaxis in spiroplasmas.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; 118: 429-436Google Scholar). Chemotaxis most likely supplies Spiroplasmas with a selective advantage over other nonmotile organisms, although motility does not appear to be required for transmissibility and phytopathogenicity in at least one species of Spiroplasma (Bove et al., 2003Bove J.M. Renaudin J. Saillard C. Foissac X. Garnier M. Spiroplasma citri, a plant pathogenic mollicute: Relationships with its two hosts, the plant and the leafhopper vector.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2003; 41: 483-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Many aspects of Spiroplasma motility have been compared to the motions of another group of helical bacteria, the spirochetes (Whitcomb, 1980Whitcomb R.F. The genus Spiroplasma.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 34: 677-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Swimming in spirochetes is achieved by coupling internal periplasmic flagellar rotation to cell bending, twisting, rotation, and translation (Berg, 1976Berg H.C. How spirochetes may swim.J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 56: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Berg et al., 1978Berg H.C. Bromley D.B. Charon N.W. Leptospiral motility.in: Microbes in the Natural Environments, Symposia of the Society for General Microbiology, Volume 34. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1978: 285-295Google Scholar). During chemotaxis, flexing of the cell body about its midpoint is used to alter the swimming course for some spirochetes (Charon et al., 1992Charon N.W. Greenberg E.P. Koopman M.B. Limberger R.J. Spirochete chemotaxis, motility, and the structure of the spirochetal periplasmic flagella.Res. Microbiol. 1992; 143: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Using this framework, it was proposed that rotation and flexing in Spiroplasma might serve these same purposes (Daniels et al., 1980Daniels M.J. Longland J.M. Gilbart J. Aspects of motility and chemotaxis in spiroplasmas.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; 118: 429-436Google Scholar, Gilad et al., 2003Gilad R. Porat A. Trachtenberg S.

Microbiol. 1980; 34: 677-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we report the result of high-resolution video microscopy studies of swimming Spiroplasma cells. These data show that Spiroplasma swimming is driven by the propagation of a pair of kinks along the cell body and that these kinks are generated by a processive change in body helicity. To address the role of morphological changes in cell motility, we used differential interference contrast microscopy to analyze the motion of freely swimming Spiroplasma melliferum cells in liquid media. In stark contrast to spirochete motility, Spiroplasma swimming appears to be driven by the propagation of a pair of large kinks along the body axis of the cell. This method of propulsion generates thrust similarly to a wave of lateral displacement that travels down the length of a long, continuous cylinder from front to rear. Fluid coupled to the cell body moves rearward with the wave, propelling the bacterium forward (Taylor, 1951Taylor G. Analysis of the swimming of microscopic organisms.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A. 1951; 209: 447-461Crossref Google Scholar). Overall, cells moved in a zigzag path. As a kink progressed from one end of the Spiroplasma to the other, the viscous drag on the largest kink-free portion of the body dominated, causing the cell to change direction by approximately the supplement of one bend angle (Figure 1). Without exception, kinks started at the same end of the cell, which we operationally labeled as the front, and traveled smoothly toward the other end, the rear. It is unclear what structurally defines the front of a cell. Electron micrographs of Spiroplasmas with a tapered and a bulbous end have been reported (Ammar et al., 2004Ammar E.-D. Fulton D. Bai X. Meulia T. Hogenhout S.A. An attachment tip and pili-like structures in insect- and plant-pathogenic spiroplasmas of the class mollicutes.Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but these differences cannot be resolved in our images due to the limited resolution of optical microscopy. Occasionally, a short-lived kink would appear at the rear of a cell. However, these kinks did not travel processively down the cell body and did not appear to interfere with kink creation at the front. In addition, cells tethered to a surface (which were not included in our analysis of swimming cells) often exhibited haphazard kinking. For these cells, kinks sometimes reflected off the point of surface attachment, reversing direction. Kinks propagating along the cell body came in pairs (Figure 2). The distribution of times between kinks within a pair, tkink, was approximately Gaussian with a mean of 0.26 s (Figure 3A ). On average, the second kink was created at the front of the cell as the first neared the rear. In contrast, the time between kink pairs, during which the body remains straight, tstraight, appeared to be exponentially distributed with a time constant of 1 s (Figure 3B).Figure 3Distributions of Cell Swimming ParametersShow full caption(A) Histogram of the time between the beginning of each kink within a pair as defined in Figure 2.

Error bars represent SEM. To ensure that the observed behavior represented free swimming, control experiments were performed in 70 μm thick flow chambers (data not shown). Swimming behavior in these cells was identical to those in the thinner slide preparations (see Experimental Procedures), although they swam more quickly out of the plane of focus. Kink location along the cell body corresponded to the position of a transformation in helicity (Figures 1G and 1I), reminiscent of kinks seen in mixed helices of flagella from Salmonella (Davis, 1978Davis R.E. Spiroplasma associated with flowers of the tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera L.).Can. J. Microbiol. 1978; 24: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Hotani, 1976Hotani H.

The helicity of a section of a cell can be deduced from the direction of slant of portions of that cell relative to the helical axis in an image focused above or below the cell (Goldstein and Charon, 1990Goldstein S.F.

The bacterial linear motor of spiroplasma melliferum bc3: From single molecules to swimming cells.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 671-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To address whether this helical transformation is sufficient to explain the bend in the cell body, we measured the bend angle from each kink as well as the helical pitch angles at positions in front of and behind the kink (Figure 1M). Bend angles from all cells were remarkably constant and measured 111 ± 9 degrees (mean ± SD). If no strain is maintained at the junction between two cotangent, conormal helices, the bend angle is given byθbend=180°−θ1−θ2,where θ1,2 refer to the pitch angles of the helical section closer to the front or the back, respectively (Goldstein et al., 2000Goldstein R.E. Goriely A. Huber G. Wolgemuth C.W. Bistable helices.Phys. Rev. Lett. 2000; 84: 1631-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Hotani, 1976Hotani H. Light microscope study of mixed helices in reconstituted Salmonella flagella.J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106: 151-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For Spiroplasma, we found that θ1 = 34.6 ± 0.5 degrees, and θ2 = 35.1 ± 0.5 degrees (mean ± SEM), which predicts a mean bend angle of 110 degrees, in excellent agreement with our measured value of 111 degrees. Our data are thus consistent with a model in which a kink is generated by the change in helicity, with no additional strain introduced into the system. Propagation of a kink is therefore created by a processive change in the helicity of the cell body from front to back. Cells often rotated during kink propagation, a requirement for a helical transformation, although overall body rotation was loosely coupled to kink position and forward motion (Figure 1). Two forms of rotation satisfy this constraint (Goldstein et al., 2000Goldstein R.E. Goriely A. Huber G. Wolgemuth C.W. Bistable helices.Phys. Rev.

Swimming Spiroplasma cells exhibited both forms, although the latter appeared predominantly. The observation that kinks come in pairs indicates that one handedness of the body helix is preferred. Due to an ambiguity in the position of the focal plane relative to a swimming cell, it is impossible for us to measure the absolute handedness of swimming cells. Traditionally, helicity is reconstructed from microscope images by moving the objective, or, equivalently, the microscope sample, such that an immobilized object of interest is examined at positions above and below the image plane. However, the Brownian motion of freely swimming cells is sufficiently large when compared to the depth of field of our microscope that we are unable to perform such a procedure. During our measurements, it is impossible to tell whether a freely swimming cell lies above or below the image plane. However, when viewed in electron micrographs, Spiroplasma are predominantly right-handed (RH) helices (Ammar et al., 2004Ammar E.-D. Fulton D. Bai X. Meulia T. Hogenhout S.A.

Morphology and ultrastructure of helical and nonhelical strains of spiroplasma citri.J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 973-981PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of this observation, we assigned a RH chirality to cells measured in the straight phase (Figure 2). The appearance of the first kink in a pair, therefore, introduces a left-handed (LH) chirality, while the appearance of the second kink returns the cell to its normal RH chirality. Using this framework, we measured the pitch angles for the RH and LH helices and found them to be significantly different: θRH = 36.5 ± 0.5 degrees and θLH = 33.0 ± 0.4 degrees (p < 10−6). This variation is similar to the difference between LH and RH flagellar filaments from Salmonella, which has been shown to arise from a change in the spacing of the flagellar subunits (Hotani, 1976Hotani H.

Similarly, we expect that the observed difference between the pitch angles for the two helicities seen in Spiroplasma cells is directly related to different configurations of the internal cytoskeleton. The addition of methylcellulose caused cell speed to increase (Figure 2), in agreement with previous results on the effects of increased viscosity on Spiroplasma motility (Daniels et al., 1980Daniels M.J.

In standard medium, kinks moved along the cell body at a speed of 10.5 ± 0.3 μm/s relative to the front of the cell, and cells traveled at a velocity of 3.3 ± 0.2 μm/s in the direction opposite to that of the kink movement. The addition of 0.5% methylcellulose (w/v) to the medium did not affect the velocity of kink travel along the cell, but significantly increased the conversion of kink motion to forward movement (Figures 3C and 3D). In this solution, kinks traveled at a speed of 10.1 ± 0.7 μm/s, and cells swam with a velocity of 4.7 ± 0.3 μm/s. This increase in speed in the presence of methylcellulose, 42% for Spiroplasma cells, is also exhibited by spirochetes due to the gel-like character of this solution. A highly structured mesh of unbranched polymers, such as methylcellulose, forms a rigid network that is able to exert forces normal to a segment of the cell body even when that segment does not move in the normal direction (Berg and Turner, 1979Berg H.C. Turner L. Movement of microorganisms in viscous environments.Nature. 1979; 278: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). If unidirectional propagation of kinks is used for propulsion, how might Spiroplasma achieve chemotaxis? We expect that a directional bias is realized by modifying the time between kink pairs, using rotational Brownian motion to randomize the swimming course. This is similar to the strategy used by some bacteria whose flagellar motors only rotate in one direction (Armitage and Macnab, 1987Armitage J.P. Macnab R.M. Unidirectional, intermittent rotation of the flagellum of rhodobacter-sphaeroides.J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 514-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Chernova et al., 2003Chernova A.A. Armitage J.P. Packer H.L. Maini P.K. Response kinetics of tethered bacteria to stepwise changes in nutrient concentration.Biosystems. 2003; 71: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). If the dwell time between kink pairs is decreased in the presence of an increasing gradient of chemoattractant, cells swimming would become biased (Schnitzer et al., 1990Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Berg H.C. Purcell E.M. Strategies for chemotaxis.in: Biology of the Chemotactic Response, Symposia of the Society for General Microbiology, Volume 46. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1990: 15-34Google Scholar). This model assumes that kinks occur and propagate faster than the rotational diffusion time of a Spiroplasma about a direction normal to the helical axis. Our cells measured 4.4 ± 0.8 μm long (mean ± SD), corresponding to a time of 6 s to diffuse about 60 degrees in 0.5% methylcellulose. Because the time spent kinked, about 0.6 s for a kink pair, is much less than the diffusion time, modulation of tstraight can lead to chemotaxis. Swimming on a microscopic scale can only be accomplished by a series of motions that are nonreciprocal, i.e., asymmetric with respect to time (Ludwig, 1930Ludwig W. Z. Vgl. Physiol. 1930; 13: 397-504Google Scholar, Purcell, 1977Purcell E.M. Life at low Reynolds number.Am. J. Phys. 1977; 45: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2603) Google Scholar, Taylor, 1951Taylor G. Analysis of the swimming of microscopic organisms.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A. 1951; 209: 447-461Crossref Google Scholar). Until now, bacterial swimming has been understood in terms of rotary motion exemplified in the form of flagellar spinning. Our data show that Spiroplasma propulsion, in contrast, is generated by waves of lateral displacement that propagate down the length of the cell, an entirely different mechanism. These waves are created by a change in the handedness of the cell body that naturally generates a 111 degree bend due to the pitch angles of right- and left-handed cells. On the basis of these findings, it seems likely that the helical cytoskeleton of Spiroplasma can exist in two different states of helicity and that swimming takes advantage of this bistability. Theoretically, the energetics of helical transformations propagating along bistable helices has been shown to give rise to a variety of rotational motions, an analysis that should apply to Spiroplasma motility (Goldstein et al., 2000Goldstein R.E. Goriely A. Huber G. Wolgemuth C.W. Bistable helices.Phys. Rev. Lett. 2000; 84: 1631-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The existence of a cell front from which kinks begin and the regular spacing in time of the two kinks within a pair provide strong evidence for the presence of a motor that initiates kink propagation. Further experiments will be necessary to provide details of this motor’s structure and how it interacts with Spiroplasma’s dynamic cytoskeleton to produce motion. Spiroplasma melliferum BC-3 (ATCC 33219) cells were grown at 32°C in T medium as described (Daniels et al., 1980Daniels M.J. Longland J.M. Gilbart J. Aspects of motility and chemotaxis in spiroplasmas.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; 118: 429-436Google Scholar). Active, exponentially growing Spiroplasma cultures were mixed with T medium, or T medium with 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose (4,000 cps). Drops (2 μl) of these solutions were placed on microscope slides and covered with coverslips, and the edges were sealed with a Vaseline:lanolin:paraffin mixture (1:1:1) to prevent evaporation. Control experiments in larger flow chambers were performed by separating a coverslip from a glass slide by two pieces of 70 μm thick double-sided tape to form a channel through which cells in medium were added. Observations were performed at room temperature on a modified Zeiss Axiovert S100 inverted microscope equipped with a 100W Hg arc lamp, a 100× 1.3 NA DIC objective, and a 1.4 N.A. DIC condenser. Images from the camera port were further magnified onto an NTSC CCD camera (Watec Co., Ltd., Japan) such that each camera pixel spanned a 37 nm × 37 nm square in the object plane. Video frames were digitized with a PCI bus frame grabber (National Instruments Corp., Austin, Texas) and streamed to hard disk via custom software written in Labview (National Instruments Corp., Austin, Texas). Movies of swimming cells were recorded for a minimum of 5 s up to a maximum of 45 s before cells would typically swim out of the field of view or plane of focus. Image analysis of each movie frame was performed using custom software written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, Oregon). Morphological parameters and cell and kink velocities were measured for each swimming cell (standard medium, n = 11; 0.5% methylcellulose, n = 4). All measurements are reported as the mean ± SEM, unless otherwise noted.

We found that Akt and GSK3 are sensitive to glucose, because fasting decreased and glucose administration increased by severalfold the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of non-diabetic mice. Brain Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation also increased after streptozotocin administration (3 days), which increased blood glucose and depleted blood insulin, indicating regulation by glucose availability even with deficient insulin. Changes in Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation and activities in epididymal fat were opposite to those of brain after streptozotocin treatment. Streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia and increased brain Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation were reversed by lowering blood glucose with insulin administration. Long term hyperglycemia also increased brain Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation, both 4 weeks after streptozotocin and in db/db insulin-resistant mice. Thus, the Akt-GSK3 signaling pathway is regulated in mouse brain in vivo in response to physiological and pathological changes in insulin and glucose.

Insulin resistance and diabetes represent increasingly prevalent conditions that involve impaired regulation of glucose production and utilization (1Zimmet P. Alberti K.G. Shaw J. Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). Recently much has been learned about insulin resistance in insulin-sensitive peripheral tissues, such as fat and skeletal muscle (2Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar, 3White M.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1710-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is understood about diabetes-induced changes in insulin-linked signaling activities in the brain even though cognition is often impaired in diabetic subjects (4Gispen W.H. Biessels G.J. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 542-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), and the brain accounts for ∼20% of the energy utilization in the body of adult humans (5Hofman M.A. Q. Rev. Biol. 1983; 58: 495-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Glucose is the predominant substrate of the brain, and its consumption is tightly linked to neuronal activity, leaving neuronal function highly dependent on a continual supply of glucose (6McCall A.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 490: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because of this high demand for glucose, neurons have developed energy-efficient designs (7Laughlin S.B. Sejnowski T.J. Science. 2003; 301: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) and specialized glucose uptake mechanisms (8McEwen B.S. Reagan L.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 490: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) to ensure adequate supply even at times when circulating glucose levels are low. Incumbent upon a system relying almost exclusively on glucose are mechanisms to sense and respond to fluctuations in the level of glucose, such as the well known regulation of blood flow by the brain that constricts or dilates arterioles to regulate local blood flow in accordance with demands of neuronal activity (9Attwell D. Iadecola C. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 621-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 10Routh V.H. Physiol. Behav. 2002; 76: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, the brain is largely insulated from changes of insulin in the blood (11Kyriaki G Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 2003; 23: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), so little is known about how insulin-coupled signaling systems within the brain either sense, or respond to, fluctuations in the circulating level of glucose or if they are buffered from such fluctuations. Insulin receptors in virtually all vertebrate tissues, including the brain, are coupled to the prominent signaling pathway encompassing Akt (also known as protein kinase B) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). 2The abbreviations used are: GSK3glycogen synthase kinase-3ipintraperitoneallyZDFZucker diabetic fattyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. In insulin-responsive tissues, insulin signaling activates Akt, which inactivates GSK3 (12Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). Akt is activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine 308 and serine 473 carried out by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and an unidentified kinase often called PDK2, respectively (13Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the activity of GSK3 is inhibited by N-terminal serine phosphorylation of the two GSK3 isoforms, serine 9 in GSK3β and serine 21 in GSK3α. Akt often appears to be the predominant kinase mediating this phosphorylation of GSK3, although this serine phosphorylation of GSK3 can be carried out by several other kinases under certain circumstances (14Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). This coupling of Akt and GSK3 leads to inverse changes in their activities; when Akt activity is high it maintains GSK3 in a serine-phosphorylated inhibited state, and decreases in Akt activity lead to dephosphorylation and activation of GSK3. Thus insulin causes increases in the phosphorylation states of both Akt and GSK3, and in peripheral tissues such as epididymal fat and skeletal muscle these kinases can become dephosphorylated by insulin resistance and diabetes (2Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar, 3White M.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1710-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The brain is considered to be largely buffered from detrimental effects of glucose fluctuations by efficient insulin-independent glucose transporters and utilization mechanisms (8McEwen B.S. Reagan L.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 490: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 15Schulingkamp R.J. Pagano T.C. Hung D. Raffa R.B. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2000; 24: 855-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). However, numerous studies have documented changes in higher brain functions, such as memory and mood, associated with fluctuations in the circulating glucose concentration, indicating an influence on neuronal signaling systems (4Gispen W.H.

Animals and Treatments—Adult, male C57BL/6 mice (Frederick Cancer Research, Frederick, MD), 6–7 weeks old, were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with streptozotocin (150 mg/kg in citrate buffer, pH 4.6) or vehicle for controls, either 3 days or 4 weeks before sacrifice. Adult male BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (Jackson Laboratories), 7–8 weeks old, were used for a type II diabetic model animal. All mice were allowed to drink ad libitum and kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Where indicated, mice were given intraperitoneal injections of d-glucose (2 g/kg) or insulin (5 international units/kg bovine pancreas insulin; Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline after overnight food withdrawal. Blood glucose levels were measured using a glucose monitor (True Track Smart System). Insulin concentrations were measured using an ultrasensitive mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay (Mercodia, Winston Salem, NC). Body temperatures were measured rectally using a CyQ model 111 thermocouple (CyperSense Inc, Nicholasville, KY). Tissue Preparation—Mice were decapitated, and brains were rapidly dissected in ice-cold saline. Brain regions were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 100 nm okadaic acid. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined in triplicate using the Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 41: 248-254Crossref Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) protein assay. Immunoblotting—Extracts were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS) and placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Proteins were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with antibodies to phospho-Ser9-GSK3β, phospho-Ser21-GSK3α, phospho-Tyr279/216-GSK3α/β, total GSK3α/β, phospho-Ser473-Akt, phospho-Thr308-Akt, and total Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence, and statistical significance was determined using analysis of variance. Enzyme Activities—Akt activity in the cerebral cortex was measured after immunoprecipitation of Akt from 100 μg of protein with 3.5 μgof monoclonal Akt antibody. Immobilized immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5 mm NaF). Kinase activity was measured by mixing immunoprecipitates with 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 125 μm ATP, 1.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 100 μm crosstide peptide substrate (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, centrifuged, and triplicates were spotted onto P81 filter paper. The filter papers were washed four times in 0.5% phosphoric acid for a total time of 1 h, rinsed in 95% ethanol, air-dried for 30 min, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Akt activity in epididymal fat was measured after immunoprecipitation from 200 μg of protein using a nonradioactive Akt activity assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology). GSK3α activity in cerebral cortex and epididymal fat was measured after immunoprecipitation of GSK3α from 100 μg of protein with 3 μg of polyclonal GSK3α antibody. Immobilized immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer. Kinase activity was measured by mixing immunoprecipitates with 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 125 μm ATP, 1.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 μm phosphoglycogen synthase peptide-2 substrate (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, centrifuged, triplicates were spotted onto P81 filter paper, and treated as in the Akt activity assay. GSK3β activity in cerebral cortex and epididymal fat was measured as described previously (20Watcharasit P. Bijur G.N. Zmijewski J.W. Song L. Zmijewska A. Chen X. Johnson G.V.W. Jope R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) after immunoprecipitation of GSK3β from 100 μg or 200 μg of protein, respectively, with 1.5 μg of monoclonal GSK3β antibody. Immobilized immune complexes were washed as for GSK3α. Kinase activity was measured by mixing immunoprecipitates with 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 125 μm ATP, 1.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.1 μg/μl recombinant Tau protein (Panvera, Madison, WI). The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS) was added to each sample to stop the reaction. Samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and proteins were separated in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were vacuum-dried, exposed to a phosphorscreen overnight, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The efficiencies of immunoprecipitations were determined by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. Brain Akt and GSK3 Are Dephosphorylated during Fasting—To test if the Akt-GSK3 coupled signaling pathway in mammalian brain is sensitive to peripheral glucose availability, we first examined if food withdrawal for 24 h affected the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3 in mouse brain. These measurements used immunoblot analyses with phosphospecific antibodies to Akt or each of the two isoforms of GSK3 in samples of cerebral cortex and hippocampus obtained from adult, male C57BL/6 mice, with four mice per group. Food withdrawal significantly reduced blood glucose concentrations to 66 ± 4% of control levels, reduced blood insulin levels to 51 ± 3% of controls, but did not significantly change body weight or temperature (TABLE ONE). It has been reported that hypothermia during hypoglycemia caused by three days of starvation increased phospho-Ser9-GSK3β levels in mouse brain (21Planel E. Miyasaka T. Launey T. Chui D.H. Tanemura K. Sato S. Murayama O. Ishiguro K. Tatebayashi Y. Takashima A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2401-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar); thus, in the present study, temperature was monitored to ensure that hypothermia did not occur to obscure the effects of changes in glucose. In both brain regions food withdrawal resulted in large decreases of the dual phosphorylation of Akt, phospho-Thr308-Akt (in the cortex to 24 ± 6% of control, means ± S.E.; n = 4) and phospho-Ser473-Akt (in the cortex to 41 ± 8% of control), but the total level of Akt was unaffected (Fig. 1A). There were also large decreases in the serine phosphorylation of both isoforms of GSK3, phospho-Ser9-GSK3β (in the cortex to 38 ± 9% of control) and phospho-Ser21-GSK3α (in the cortex to 30 ± 5% of control), whereas phosphotyrosine and total levels of GSK3α and GSK3β were unaltered (Fig. 1B). Thus, decreased blood glucose and insulin concentrations caused by food withdrawal for 24 h were associated with decreases in the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 in two regions of mouse brain.TABLE ONEBody weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, and body temperature of control and 24 h fasted miceBody weightBlood glucoseSerum insulinTemperaturegmmg/dlng/ml°CControl21.4 ± 0.6aData are means ± S.E. for four mice per group.126.5 ± 2.20.39 ± 0.0234.0 ± 0.1Fasted19.9 ± 0.483.1 ± 5.6bp < 0.05.0.20 ± 0.01bp < 0.05.32.9 ± 0.2a Data are means ± S.E. for four mice per group.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Brain Akt and GSK3 Are Phosphorylated after Glucose Administration— Because food withdrawal indicated there was an inverse relationship between blood glucose and/or insulin levels and the phosphorylation of brain Akt and GSK3, the converse experiment was carried out in which a bolus of glucose was administered to mice. To provide a consistent baseline blood glucose level in all of the mice, the glucose was administered after a 14-h period of food withdrawal. Following treatment with 2 g/kg glucose, the blood glucose and insulin levels rapidly increased and reached peak levels after 10 and 5 min, respectively, (Fig. 2A) whereas body temperature was not changed. Glucose administration caused rapid and substantial increases in the levels of phospho-Thr308-Akt, phospho-Ser473-Akt, phospho-Ser21-GSK3α, and phospho-Ser9-GSK3β in both the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus (Fig. 2, B and C). Taken together, the results of food deprivation and of glucose administration show that the phosphorylation states of Akt and GSK3 in two regions of mouse brain are regulated by both decreases and increases in the circulating levels of glucose and insulin. Brain Akt and GSK3 Are Transiently Phosphorylated after Insulin Administration—To test if increased insulin was sufficient to trigger changes in brain Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation, insulin was administered to mice. Administration of 5 international units/kg insulin caused a large increase in blood insulin and a subsequent decrease in blood glucose (Fig. 3A). The rapid increase in insulin concentration caused a rapid but transient increase in the dual phosphorylation of Akt in cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 3B). Akt phosphorylation reached a peak 5 min after insulin administration, which rapidly reverted to basal levels as the glucose concentration plummeted, although the insulin concentration remained elevated. Similar patterns of changes in the phosphorylation of both GSK3 isoforms occurred in both brain regions (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that both glucose and insulin contribute to regulating the phosphorylation states of Akt and GSK3 in the brain in vivo. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that the regulatory phosphorylation states of Akt and GSK3 in mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus are modulated in an inverse manner by fluctuations in the blood glucose concentration, such that the kinases are dephosphorylated when blood glucose levels are below normal, and are phosphorylated when blood glucose levels are elevated, and that circulating insulin is also able to modulate Akt and GSK3 in the brain. This raised the question of whether changes in circulating glucose in the absence of insulin is sufficient to regulate these kinases in the brain, which can occur in pathological states of hyperglycemia associated with diabetes. Diabetes Increases Brain Akt and GSK3 Phosphorylation—Hyperglycemic conditions in mouse models of diabetes were used to test if short and long term pathological increases in circulating glucose levels regulate the phosphorylation of brain Akt and GSK3. The first group of experiments employed streptozotocin treatment to induce hyperglycemia resulting from insulin depletion. Streptozotocin administered to mice causes a rapid degeneration of insulin-producing β-cells of the pancreas, resulting in greatly diminished production of insulin and a resultant elevation of blood glucose levels. Three days after streptozotocin treatment, insulin levels were reduced to 28 ± 2% of control levels (TABLE TWO). Concurrently, blood glucose levels were elevated to 304 ± 6% of control levels. The body weights but not temperatures of streptozotocin-treated mice were significantly different from controls. Three days after streptozotocin administration the phosphorylation of Akt at both Thr308 and Ser473 was significantly increased above the control levels in both the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus (Fig. 4A). There were no differences in the total protein level of Akt in either brain region. There were similarly large increases in the serine phosphorylation levels of GSK3α and GSK3β 3 days following streptozotocin treatment in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 4B). There were no changes in tyrosine phosphorylation, and total levels of GSK3 in either brain region 3 days after administration of streptozotocin. These results further underscore the conclusion that the circulating glucose concentration regulates brain Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation because insulin was reduced but glucose was elevated in association with the increases in Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation. Thus, these results show that short term pathological hyperglycemia caused large increases in the regulatory phosphorylation states of brain Akt and GSK3.TABLE TWOBody weight, blood glucose, serum insulin, and body temperature of control mice and of mice 3 days after steptozotocin treatmentBody weightBlood glucoseSerum insulinTemperaturegmmg/dlng/ml°CControl25.5 ± 0.5aData are means ± S.E. for four mice per group.135.4 ± 4.90.43 ± 0.0133.0 ± 0.3STZ 3 day19.5 ± 0.5bp < 0.05.412.0 ± 8.3bp < 0.05.0.12 ± 0.01bp < 0.05.32.2 ± 0.2a Data are means ± S.E. for four mice per group.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab To ensure that streptozotocin-induced insulin depletion decreased signaling by insulin receptors, epididymal fat samples were examined as a control tissue. As expected, and in marked contrast to brain tissue, 3 days after streptozotocin treatment epididymal fat displayed large decreases in the levels of phospho-Thr308-Akt and phospho-Ser473-Akt, whereas the total levels of Akt remained unchanged (Fig. 5A). There were also large decreases in phospho-Ser21-GSK3α and phospho-Ser9-GSK3β in fat from treated mice compared with controls, but no changes in the tyrosine-phosphorylated or total levels of GSK3 (Fig. 5B). Thus, the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 in fat exhibited the large decreases predicted to occur following insulin depletion. The activities of Akt and GSK3β were measured in cerebral cortex and epididymal fat 3 days after streptozotocin treatment to ensure that changes in phosphorylation levels reflected altered kinase activities, as has been well documented previously for each enzyme. Three days after streptozotocin treatment, Akt activity was increased in the cerebral cortex by 2.5-fold concurrently with the increased levels of phospho-Thr308- and phospho-Ser473-Akt in the same samples (Fig. 6A). Conversely, in the same animals epididymal fat exhibited a greater than 50% decrease in Akt activity which correlated with the decreased dual phosphorylation of Akt evident in immunoblots. In accordance with the well known inhibitory effect of N-terminal serine phosphorylation of GSK3 activity, after streptozotocin treatment, the activities of GSK3α and GSK3β were increased in fat where serine phosphorylation was decreased. The activities were decreased in the cerebral cortex where serine phosphorylation of GSK3 was increased (Fig. 6B). These results confirm that the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3 reflect their enzymatic activities in both fat and brain tissue. The effects of sustained streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia were measured by examining phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3 in the brain 4 weeks after streptozotocin treatment. Large increases in the levels of phospho-Ser473-Akt and phospho-Thr308-Akt were present in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice 4 weeks after treatment with streptozotocin (Fig. 7A). These mice also displayed increased levels of phospho-Ser21-GSK3α and phospho-Ser9-GSK3β in both brain regions (Fig. 7B). Quantitation of the phosphorylation levels in four mice per group revealed statistically significant increases ranging from 2–10-fold in samples from streptozotocin-treated mice compared with control mice. In contrast to the large increases in serine phosphorylation of GSK3, tyrosine phosphorylation and total levels of both GSK3α and GSK3β were not affected by long term streptozotocin treatment. Thus, hyperglycemia caused by streptozotocin treatment caused both short and long term large increases in the phosphorylation states of Akt and GSK3 in both brain regions. To determine if the phosphorylation levels Akt and GSK3 in the brain were increased in a second mouse model of diabetes associated with hyperglycemia, male db/db mice that develop an insulin resistance phenotype (22Shao J. Yamashita H. Qiao L. Friedman J.E. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), were examined. The db/db mice were hyperglycemic and insulinopenic, with blood glucose concentrations 390 ± 7% of control levels and insulin concentrations 280 ± 12% of controls, and their body weights were significantly increased (TABLE THREE). In db/db mice, compared with control mice, there were large increases in phospho-Thr308-Akt and phospho-Ser473-Akt (Fig. 8A) and in phospho-Ser21-GSK3α and phospho-Ser9-GSK3β (Fig. 8B) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. There were no differences in total protein levels of Akt or GSK3 in db/db brain regions compared with controls. These results show that in two mouse models of diabetes, hyperglycemia was associated with large chronic increases in the phosphorylation states of Akt and GSK3 in the brain.TABLE THREEBody weight, blood glucose, and serum insulin of control and db/db miceBody weightBlood glucoseSerum insulingmmg/dLng/mlControl24.1 ± 0.4aData are means ± S.E. for three mice per group.127.2 ± 3.70.50 ± 0.02db/db35.4 ± 0.5bp < 0.05.496.7 ± 8.8bp < 0.05.1.40 ± 0.06bp < 0.05.a Data are means ± S.E. for three mice per group.b p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab To test if the hyperglycemic-induced increases in phosphorylation of brain Akt and GSK3 could be reversed by lowering the glucose level, and to confirm that the glucose was regulatory, 3 days after streptozotocin treatment, blood glucose levels were reduced by acute insulin treatment. Administration of 5 international units/kg insulin caused a rapid increase in blood insulin and a corresponding decrease in blood glucose (Fig. 9A). Insulin treatment resulted in decreases in the dual phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 9A) and in the serine phosphorylation of both GSK3 isoforms (Fig. 9B). These results show that the increased phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 in the brain caused by streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia could be rapidly reversed by lowering the blood glucose concentration. This investigation found a surprisingly strong role for physiological and pathological changes in the circulating concentration of glucose, in addition to insulin, in regulating the Akt-GSK3 signaling pathway in mouse brain. In both the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, the phosphorylation states of Akt and GSK3 were found to be influenced by physiological fluctuations in the blood glucose concentration, by acutely administered glucose or insulin, by short term (3 days) and long term (4 weeks) hyperglycemia caused by pathological insulin depletion after streptozotocin administration, and by hyperglycemia linked to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Hyperglycemia in the presence of normal or deficient insulin levels caused large increases in the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3 in the brain, as did acute insulin administration, whereas they were reduced by fasting-induced hypoglycemia or by lowering hyperglycemic glucose levels by insulin administration to streptozotocin-treated mice. Taken together, these results show that glucose as well as insulin contributes to the in vivo regulation of the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 in two regions of mouse brain, indicating that a glucose-sensing mechanism regulates brain Akt and GSK3. The present results extend previous studies of the effects of diabetes-related conditions on the phosphorylation of Akt or GSK3 in mouse brain. The IRS-2-deficient mouse model of diabetes previously was found to have increased brain levels of phospho-Ser9-GSK3β (23Schubert M. Brazil D.P. Burks D.J. Kushner J.A. Ye J. Flint C.L. Farhang-Fallah J. Dikkes P. Warot X.M. Rio C. Corfas G. White M.F. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7084-7092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a prior study had reported that these mice are hyperglycemic (24Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Although the link was not noted previously, these results are consistent with our conclusion that with deficient insulin signaling, the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3 in the brain can increase in response to elevated blood glucose levels. Other studies showed that in the absence of elevated glucose levels, deficient insulin signaling causes decreased phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 in mouse brain. Neuron-specific insulin receptor knock-out (NIRKO) mice with unaltered cerebral glucose metabolism had 50–60% decreases in the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β in brain, demonstrating that insulin receptor-linked signaling can influence the phosphorylation levels of these two kinases in the brain (25Schubert M. Gautam D. Surjo D. Ueki K. Stephanie B. Schubert D. Kondo T. Alber J. Galldiks N. Kustermann E. Arndt S. Jacobs A.H. Krone W. Kahn C.R. Bruning J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3100-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). This relationship also was observed in mice with diet-induced insulin resistance in which there was decreased phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 in the brain while blood glucose concentrations remained normal (26Ho L. Qin W. Pompl P.N. Xiang Z. Wang J. Zhao Z. Peng Y. Cambareri G. Rocher A. Mobbs C.V. Hof P.R. Pasinetti G.M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 902-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Planel et al. (21Planel E. Miyasaka T. Launey T. Chui D.H. Tanemura K. Sato S. Murayama O. Ishiguro K. Tatebayashi Y. Takashima A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2401-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) reported that 2.5 h after administration of a large dose of insulin (300 international units/kg) the level of phospho-Ser9-GSK3β increased in mouse brain. Taken together with our results, these findings indicate that insulin has a significant influence on the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3 in the brain, which decrease with deficient insulin signaling if glucose levels remain normal. However, if hyperglycemia is associated with insulin deficiency, the elevated glucose levels cause large increases in the phosphorylation levels of brain Akt and GSK3. Thus, both insulin and glucose contribute to regulating the phosphorylation levels of these kinases in the brain, indicating that a glucose-sensing mechanism operates in conjunction with insulin signaling to regulate the phosphorylation of brain Akt and GSK3. The glucose-sensing regulation of brain Akt and GSK3 differentiates the responses of these enzymes in the brain from changes in peripheral tissues under insulin-resistant conditions. In our study, Akt and GSK3 in epididymal fat were dephosphorylated following streptozotocin treatment while the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3 in the brain were dramatically increased in the same animals. There have been only a limited number of studies of the in vivo phosphorylation states of Akt and GSK3 in peripheral tissues in insulin-resistant animal models, but these previous studies have reported results consistent with decreased or unchanged phosphorylation of GSK3 and/or Akt in contrast to the large increases in brain-phosphorylated Akt and GSK3. In epididymal fat of mice with high fat diet-induced diabetes, the activity of GSK3β was increased 2-fold, likely indicative of decreased phosphorylation, whereas the activity of Akt was not changed (27Eldar-Finkelman H. Schreyer S. Shinohara M. LeBoeuf R. Krebs E. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In these same mice there was a small decrease of GSK3β activity in liver and no change in skeletal muscle, demonstrating that regulation differs among tissues even in the periphery. Studies of streptozotocin-treated rats and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats also reported no differences in skeletal muscle GSK3β activity (28Semiz S. Orvig C. McNeill J. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 231: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Henriksen E.J. Kinnick T.R. Teachey M.K. O'Keefe M.P. Ring D. Johnson K.W. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: 892-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, in human patients with type 2 diabetes, the GSK3 activity was elevated ∼2-fold in skeletal muscle, consistent with a decrease in the inhibitory serine phosphorylation of GSK3β (30Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Mudaliar S. Mohideen P. Carter L. Henry R.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The myocardium of streptozotocin-treated rats displayed decreased basal phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308, but not on Ser473, and decreased insulin-induced serine phosphorylation of both GSK3 isoforms (31Laviola L. Belsanti G. Davalli A.M. Napoli R. Perrini S. Weir G.C. Giorgino R. Giorgino F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2709-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Overall, these studies indicate that the effects of insulin resistance on Akt and GSK3 vary considerably among different tissues and that changes in the brain are relatively large, as well as opposite to, changes in peripheral tissues. During the last few years increasing attention has been focused on GSK3 as a potential therapeutic target in diabetes because inhibition of GSK3 facilitates control of glucose levels in animal models of insulin resistance (32Eldar-Finkelman H. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although as noted above there is limited data indicating that GSK3 in peripheral tissues is abnormally activated in diabetes, this is not a requirement for inhibitors to contribute to the control of glucose levels. However, overexpression of GSK3β in skeletal muscle was recently found to be sufficient to cause glucose intolerance (33Pearce N.J. Arch J.R. Clapham J.C. Coghlan M.P. Corcoran S.L. Lister C.A. Llano A. Moore G.B. Murphy G.J. Smith S.A. Taylor C.M. Yates J.W. Morrison A.D. Harper A.J. Roxbee-Cox L. Abuin A. Wargent E. Holder J.C. Metabolism. 2004; 53: 1322-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Administration of a peptide inhibitor of GSK3, L803-mts, increased glucose tolerance in diabetic mice (34Plotkin B. Kaidanovich O. Talior I. Eldar-Finkelman H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Also, administration of rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist that also inhibits GSK3, reduced circulating blood glucose levels in ZDF rats and in patients with type 2 diabetes (35Smith S.A. Porter L.E. Biswas N. Freed M.I. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 6048-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Yue T.L. Bao W. Gu J.L. Cui J. Tao L. Ma X.L. Ohlstein E.H. Jucker B.M. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Ring et al. (37Ring D.B. Johnson K.W. Henriksen E.J. Nuss J.M. Goff D. Kinnick T.R. Ma S.T. Reeder J.W. Samuels I. Slabiak T. Wagman A.S. Hammond M.E. Harrison S.D. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) found that in several models of diabetes, ob/ob mice, db/db mice, and ZDF rats, two GSK3 inhibitors, CHIR98014 and CHIR99021, lowered plasma glucose levels by as much as 50% in a dose-dependent manner without changing insulin concentrations. Two reports also showed that the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR98023 lowered glucose concentrations in ZDF rats during a glucose tolerance test (29Henriksen E.J. Kinnick T.R. Teachey M.K. O'Keefe M.P. Ring D. Johnson K.W. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: 892-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 38Cline G.W. Johnson K. Regittnig W. Perret P. Tozzo E. Xiao L. Damico C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These results indicate that inhibition of GSK3 in the periphery improves glucose regulation in diabetic animals. However, our finding of increased serine-phosphorylated GSK3 in the brain of streptozotocin-treated mice, which was reflected in reduced GSK3 activity, raises the question of whether further inhibition of brain GSK3 by the administration of GSK3 inhibitors might be detrimental to brain function. Thus, it may be preferable to consider GSK3 inhibitors with limited ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier to limit GSK3 inhibitory effects to the periphery for the possible treatment of diabetes. Considering the central roles of Akt and GSK3 in many cellular processes, and the critical role that glucose plays in neuronal function, one goal of this investigation was to test if changes in circulating levels of glucose affected the regulatory phosphorylation states of these kinases. The coupling of these kinases is an interesting, somewhat novel, signaling pathway because phosphorylation increases Akt activity but decreases GSK3 activity, so the signal strength has opposite effects on the two kinases (39Jope R.S. Johnson G.V.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). When cells are adequately stimulated the activation-inducing phosphorylation of Akt is enhanced, as is the consequential Akt-induced inhibitory serine phosphorylation of GSK3. Both physiological and pathological changes in circulating glucose levels were found to regulate the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3 in mouse brain in vivo. Because these were altered by both fasting and acute glucose administration, it appears that the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3 are perpetually fluctuating in response to food intake or deprivation. This is rather surprising considering previous notions that these enzymes are tightly controlled and primarily regulated by neurohormones such as growth factors (13Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). With pathological hyperglycemia, these fluctuations are eliminated and the enzymes are maintained in a persistent state of hyperphosphorylation. It is possible that loss of normal fluctuations of these two key kinases contributes to cognitive impairments that can occur in patients with diabetes, especially when glucose is poorly controlled or in elderly diabetic patients (4Gispen W.H. Biessels G.J. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 542-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Although only short term glucose deprivation was studied here, it may be relevant that a number of psychiatric disorders are linked with hypoglycemic states. For example, depression is frequently associated with impaired appetite and weight loss, and anorexia nervosa represents a more severe hypoglycemic state of long duration. Hypoglycemia is associated with decreased serine phosphorylation of GSK3, which is correlated with increased enzymatic activity, so it is of interest that agents therapeutic for depressive mood disorders can increase GSK3 phosphorylation in mouse brain in vivo (40Jope R.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 441-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 41Li X. Zhu W. Roh M.S. Friedman A.B. Rosborough K. Jope R.S. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2004; 29: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 is regulated by integrated signals derived from glucose as well as neurohormones such as insulin. This allows the linked Akt-GSK3 signaling pathway to act as a cellular glucose sensor and integrator of multiple signals, responses that may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in diabetes and other disorders involving altered glucose availability."
https://openalex.org/W2057006981,"The mRNA level of the aconitase gene acn of Corynebacterium glutamicum is reduced under iron limitation. Here we show that an AraC-type regulator, termed RipA for “regulator of iron proteins A,” is involved in this type of regulation. A C. glutamicum ΔripA mutant has a 2-fold higher aconitase activity than the wild type under iron limitation, but not under iron excess. Comparison of the mRNA profiles of the ΔripA mutant and the wild type revealed that the acn mRNA level was increased in the ΔripA mutant under iron limitation, but not under iron excess, indicating a repressor function of RipA. Besides acn, some other genes showed increased mRNA levels in the ΔripA mutant under iron starvation (i.e. those encoding succinate dehydrogenase (sdhCAB), nitrate/nitrite transporter and nitrate reductase (narKGHJI), isopropylmalate dehydratase (leuCD), catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (catA), and phosphotransacetylase (pta)). Most of these proteins contain iron. Purified RipA binds to the upstream regions of all operons mentioned above and in addition to that of the catalase gene (katA). From 13 identified binding sites, the RipA consensus binding motif RRGCGN4RYGAC was deduced. Expression of ripA itself is repressed under iron excess by DtxR, since purified DtxR binds to a well conserved binding site upstream of ripA. Thus, repression of acn and the other target genes indicated above under iron limitation involves a regulatory cascade of two repressors, DtxR and its target RipA. The modulation of the intracellular iron usage by RipA supplements mechanisms for iron acquisition that are directly regulated by DtxR.

Corynebacterium glutamicum is a nonpathogenic, aerobic Gram-positive soil bacterium that is used for large scale industrial production of amino acids, predominantly l-glutamate (1.5 million tons/year) and l-lysine (0.7 million tons/year). In addition, C. glutamicum has gained interest as a suitable model organism for the Corynebacterineae, a suborder of the actinomycetes that includes the genus Mycobacterium. An overview on C. glutamicum biology, genetics, physiology, and biotechnology can be found in a recent monograph (1Eggeling L. Bott M. Handbook of Corynebacterium glutamicum. CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL2005Crossref Google Scholar). The citric acid cycle is of central importance for metabolism in general and for amino acid production in particular, because it provides the biosynthetic precursors of the aspartate and glutamate family of amino acids. Despite its key role, knowledge about the genetic regulation of this pathway in C. glutamicum is scarce. We recently could show that the activity of aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3), which catalyzes the stereospecific and reversible isomerization of citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate, varies depending on the carbon source and that this is caused by transcriptional regulation (2Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A repressor of the TetR family, called AcnR, was identified, which represses aconitase by binding to an imperfect inverted repeat within the acn promoter region and interfering with the binding of RNA polymerase (2Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The factors that control binding of AcnR to its operator are not yet known. DNA microarray experiments revealed that acn expression is not only influenced by the carbon source but also by the iron concentration of the medium (2Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Under iron limitation, the acn mRNA level in the wild type was 3-fold lower than under iron excess. In the ΔacnR mutant, this decrease was even larger (4.8-fold), presumably because the increased expression of aconitase, which contains a 4Fe-4S cluster, leads to an enhanced iron starvation. We now have identified a new transcriptional regulator, designated RipA, which is responsible for iron-dependent regulation of aconitase and several other iron-containing proteins. Evidence is provided that RipA represses acn and six other target operons under iron limitation and is itself repressed under iron excess by the global iron repressor DtxR. Bacterial Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—All strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in supplemental Table S1. The C. glutamicum type strain ATCC13032 (3Kinoshita S. Udaka S. Shimono M. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1957; 3: 193-205Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar) was used as wild type. Strain ΔripA is a derivative containing an in-frame deletion of the ripA gene. For growth experiments, 5 ml of brain heart infusion medium (Difco) was inoculated with colonies from a fresh LB agar plate (4Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and incubated for 6 h at 30°C. After washing, the cells of this first preculture were used to inoculate a 500-ml shake flask containing 50 ml of CGXII minimal medium (5Keilhauer C. Eggeling L. Sahm H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5595-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 4% (w/v) glucose and either 1 μm FeSO4 (iron starvation) or 100 μm FeSO4 (iron excess). This second preculture was cultivated overnight at 30 °C and then used to inoculate the main culture to an A600 ∼1. The main culture contained the same iron concentration as the second preculture. The trace element solution with iron salts omitted and the FeSO4 solution were always added after autoclaving. For growth of C. glutamicum strains carrying plasmid pJC1 or pJC1-ripA, the medium was supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin. For all cloning purposes, Escherichia coli DH5 (Invitrogen) was used as host, for overproduction of RipA and DtxR E. coli BL21(DE3) (6Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). The E. coli strains were cultivated aerobically in LB medium at 37 °C (DH5) or at 30 °C (BL21(DE3)). When appropriate, kanamycin was added to a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Recombinant DNA Work—The enzymes for recombinant DNA work were obtained from Roche Applied Science or New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany). The oligonucleotides used in this study were obtained from Operon (Cologne, Germany) and are listed in supplemental Table S2. Routine methods like PCR, restriction, or ligation were carried out according to standard protocols (4Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA from C. glutamicum was prepared as described (7Eikmanns B.J. Thum-Schmitz N. Eggeling L. Luedtke K.U. Sahm H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Plasmids from E. coli were isolated with the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). E. coli was transformed by the RbCl method (8Hanahan D. DNA Cloning. 1. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1985: 109-135Google Scholar), and C. glutamicum was transformed by electroporation (9van der Rest M.E. Lange C. Molenaar D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 52: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed with a Genetic Analyzer 3100-Avant (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Sequencing reactions were carried out with the Thermo Sequenase primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). An in-frame ripA deletion mutant of C. glutamicum was constructed via a two-step homologous recombination procedure as described previously (10Niebisch A. Bott M. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The ripA up- and downstream regions (∼500 bp each) were amplified using the oligonucleotide pairs orf1558-A-for/orf1558-B-rev and orf1558-C-for/orf1558-D-rev, respectively, and the products served as template for cross-over PCR with oligonucleotides orf1558-A-for and orf1558-D-rev. The resulting PCR product of ∼1 kb was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into pK19mobsacB (11Schäfer A. Tauch A. Jäger W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Pühler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the cloned PCR product did not contain spurious mutations. Transfer of the resulting plasmid pK19mobsacB-ΔripA into C. glutamicum and screening for the first and second recombination event were performed as described previously (10Niebisch A. Bott M. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Kanamycin-sensitive and saccharose-resistant clones were tested by PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA with the primer pair orf1558-amp-for/orf1558-amp-rev (supplemental Table S2). Of 10 clones tested, five showed the wild-type situation (2.0-kb fragment) and five had the desired in-frame deletion of the ripA gene (1.1-kb fragment), in which all nucleotides except for the first six codons and the last 12 codons were replaced by a 21-bp tag. In order to complement the ΔripA mutant, the ripA coding region and 250-bp upstream DNA containing the promoter region were amplified using oligonucleotides (ripA+250-for (2Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and ripA+250-rev) introducing a SalI and a PstI restriction site, respectively. The resulting 1245-bp PCR product was cloned into the vector pJC1 (12Cremer J. Eggeling L. Sahm H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 478-480Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pJC1-ripA and pJC1 were used to transform C. glutamicum wild type and the ΔripA strain. For overproduction and purification of RipA with an N-terminal StrepTag-II (13Skerra A. Schmidt T.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 271-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ripA coding region was amplified using oligonucleotides that introduce an NdeI restriction site, including the start codon (ripA-2-for) and an XhoI restriction site after the stop codon (ripA-2-rev). The purified PCR product was cloned in the modified expression vector pET28b-Streptag (14Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pET28b-Streptag-ripA. The RipA protein encoded by this plasmid contains 14 additional amino acids (MASWSHPQFEKGAH) at the amino terminus. For overproduction and purification of DtxR, the dtxR coding region (equivalent to NCgl1845) was amplified using oligonucleotides that introduced an NdeI restriction site at the translation initiation codon (dtxR-for-1) and four histidine codons plus an XhoI restriction site before the stop codon (dtxR-rev-1). The PCR product was cloned into the pET24b vector, resulting in plasmid pET24b-dtxR-C. The DtxR protein encoded by this plasmid contains 12 additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (HHHHLEHHHHHH). The PCR-derived portions of pET28b-Streptag-ripA and pET24b-dtxR-C were analyzed by DNA sequence analysis and found to contain no spurious mutations. For overproduction of RipA and DtxR, the two plasmids were transferred into E. coli BL21(DE3). Preparation of Total RNA—Cultures of the wild type and the ΔripA mutant were grown in CGXII minimal medium containing 4% (w/v) glucose under iron limitation (1 μm FeSO4) or iron excess (100 μm FeSO4). In the exponential growth phase at an A600 of 4–6, 25 ml of the cultures were used for the preparation of total RNA as described previously (15Möker N. Brocker M. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Morbach S. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 420-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Isolated RNA samples were analyzed for quantity and quality by UV spectrophotometry and denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis (4Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), respectively, and stored at -70 °C until use. DNA Microarray Analyses—The generation of whole-genome DNA microarrays (16Wendisch V.F. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), synthesis of fluorescently labeled cDNA from total RNA, microarray hybridization, washing, and data analysis were performed as described previously (2Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Lange C. Rittmann D. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. Sahm H. Appl. Environ.

Krause M. Bott M. Wendisch V.F. Sahm H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4519-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Genes that exhibited significantly changed mRNA levels (p < 0.05 in a Student's t test) by at least a factor of 1.7 were determined in two series of DNA microarray experiments: (i) five comparisons of the wild type and the ΔripA mutant cultivated in CGXII minimal medium with 4% (w/v) glucose under iron limitation (1 mm FeSO4); (ii) two comparisons of the wild type and the ΔripA mutant cultivated in CGXII-glucose medium under iron excess (100 μm FeSO4). Aconitase Assay—Aconitase activity was determined as the rate of cis-aconitate formation from isocitrate (20Henson C.P. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (2Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), except that the assay was performed at 30 °C. Cells of the 20-ml main culture were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min and 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 90 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and used for the preparation of cell extract. The assay mixture contained 950–995 μl of 90 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 mm dl-trisodium isocitrate. The reaction was started with the addition of 5–50 μl of cell extract, and the formation of cis-aconitate was followed by measuring the absorbance increase at 240 nm using a Jasco V560 spectrophotometer. An extinction coefficient for cis-aconitate of 3.6 mm-1 cm-1 at 240 nm was used. One unit of activity corresponds to 1 μmol of isocitrate converted to cis-aconitate per min. Overproduction and Purification of RipA—E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the plasmid pET28b-strep-ripA was grown at 30 °C in 200 ml of LB medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin to an A600 of ∼1.2 before adding 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. After cultivation for another 4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once, and stored at -20 °C. For cell extract preparation, thawed cells were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer W (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). After the addition of 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the cell suspension was passed three times through a French pressure cell (SLM Aminco, Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) at 207 megapascals. Intact cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (15 min, 5,000 × g, 4 °C), and the cell-free extract was subjected to ultracentrifugation (1 h, 150,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant obtained after ultracentrifugation was applied to a StrepTactin-Sepharose column with a bed volume of 1 ml (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). The column was washed with 6 ml of buffer W, and RipA tagged with StrepTag-II was eluted with 8 × 0.5 ml of buffer W containing 7.5 mm desthiobiotin (Sigma). Fractions containing RipA were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged against TG buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerin) using Vivaspin concentrators with a cut-off of 10 kDa. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of the protein preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent protein detection with Gel Code blue stain reagent (Pierce). Using this protocol, ∼0.2 mg of RipA protein was purified to apparent homogeneity from 200 ml of culture. Overproduction and Purification of DtxR—E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the plasmid pET24b-dtxR was grown at 30 °C in 100 ml of LB with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Expression was induced at an A600 of ∼0.3 with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Four hours after induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -20 °C. For cell extract preparation, thawed cells were washed once and resuspended in 10 ml of TNGI5 buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm imidazol) containing 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Disruption of the cells and fractionation by centrifugation was performed as described above for RipA purification. DtxR present in the supernatant of the ultracentrifugation step was purified by nickel affinity chromatography using nickel-activated nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Novagen). After washing the column with TNGI50 buffer (which contains 50 mm imidazol), DtxR protein was eluted with TNGI100 buffer (which contains 100 mm imidazol). Fractions containing DtxR were pooled, and the elution buffer was exchanged against TG buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerin). From 100 ml of culture, ∼3 mg of DtxR was purified to apparent homogeneity. Gel Shift Assays—For band shift assays of RipA with putative target promoters, purified RipA protein was mixed with DNA fragments (200–630 bp, final concentration 8–13 nm) in a total volume of 20 μl. The binding buffer contained 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Approximately 20 nm of different nontarget promoter fragments (clpC, clpP, ripA, and porB) were added as a negative control. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the samples were separated on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel at room temperature and 170 V using 1× TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) as electrophoresis buffer. The gels were subsequently stained with Sybr Green I according to the instructions of the supplier (Sigma) and photographed. Binding of DtxR to the ripA promoter was carried out in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2,40 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 μm MnCl2, an 18 nm concentration of a 300-bp ripA promoter DNA fragment, and DtxR in concentrations ranging from 0 to 3.6 μm. The ripA fragment covered the region from position -230 to +70 relative to the translation start and was obtained by PCR with primers ripA-Prom-for and ripA-Prom-rev. As a negative control, a 23 nm concentration of a 200-bp acn promoter fragment extending from position +190 to -50 relative to the acn transcription start site (2Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was added. This fragment was amplified with primers acn-Prom4-for and acn-Prom4-rev. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then loaded onto a 10% native polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 150 μm MnCl2. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature and 170 V using 1× TB (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 150 μm MnCl2 as electrophoresis buffer. All PCR products used in the gel shift assays were purified with the PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted in EB buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5). Identification of RipA as a Potential Iron-dependent Regulator of the Aconitase Gene—In a previous study, we showed that expression of the aconitase gene acn of C. glutamicum is influenced by the iron availability, being reduced under iron limitation (2Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This regulation also occurred in a mutant lacking AcnR, a repressor of the acn gene, and thus must be mediated by a different regulator or regulatory mechanism. A candidate gene that might be responsible for iron-dependent regulation of acn was identified in the DNA microarray experiments used to compare the gene expression profile of C. glutamicum under iron excess and iron limitation. Expression of the gene NCgl0943 was strongly influenced by the iron availability (2Krug A. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Its mRNA level was always found to be increased under iron-limiting conditions, and it thus behaved like typical iron starvation genes. The protein derived from NCgl0943 is composed of 331 amino acid residues (36.044 kDa) and contains a DNA binding domain of the AraC family (PF00165 in the PFAM data base (21Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PS01124 in the PROSITE data base (22Falquet L. Pagni M. Bucher P. Hulo N. Sigrist C.J.A. Hofmann K. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar)) with two helix-turn-helix motifs extending from position 113 to 159 and from position 165 to 208. It is flanked by amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of 112 and 123 residues, respectively, which show no significant sequence similarity to other proteins. Based on the results described below, the NCgl0943 gene was designated ripA (repressor of iron proteins A). In order to test an involvement of the RipA protein in acn regulation, a ripA deletion mutant of C. glutamicum was constructed. In a first set of experiments, the growth behavior of the ΔripA mutant was tested. As shown in Fig. 1A, no differences were observed between wild type and mutant cultivated in glucose minimal medium containing excess iron (100 μm). However, under iron-limiting conditions (1 μm), the ripA mutant grew initially like the wild type, but after an A600 of about 5, the growth rate of the mutant decreased more strongly than that of the wild type. The final cell density of the mutant (A600 of 20) was only half that of the wild type (A600 = 40). Thus, the ΔripA mutant has a growth defect under iron limitation but not under iron excess. As shown in Fig. 1C, this growth defect could be reversed by transformation with a plasmid carrying the ripA gene with its native promoter region (pJC1-ripA), but not with pJC1 alone (Fig. 1B). In a second set of experiments, aconitase activity was determined in wild-type and ΔripA cells from cultures grown under iron excess and iron limitation. As shown in Fig. 2, the aconitase activity of the two strains was nearly identical under iron excess, whereas under iron limitation, the ΔripA mutant had a 1.5–2-fold higher activity than the wild type at four different time points. Thus, the absence of ripA might result in an increased expression of the acn gene under iron limitation, but not under iron excess. Comparison of the Expression Profiles of ΔripA Mutant and Wild Type with DNA Chips—In order to determine the effects of RipA on acn expression as well as on global gene expression, whole genome DNA microarrays of C. glutamicum (16Wendisch V.F. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were used to compare the mRNA ratios of the ΔripA mutant and the wild type under iron limitation and iron excess. Under iron starvation (1 μm iron), nine genes showed a >1.7-fold higher mRNA level in the ΔripA mutant (TABLE ONE). This group included the aconitase gene acn, supporting the above made assumption that increased acn expression is responsible for the elevated aconitase activity in the ΔripA mutant under iron limitation. Besides acn, catA (catechol 1,2-dioxygenase), leuCD (isopropylmalate dehydratase), narKGHJI (nitrate/nitrite transporter and nitrate reductase), sdhCAB (succinate dehydrogenase), and pta (phosphotransacetylase) showed higher mRNA levels in the ΔripA mutant compared with the wild type. The mRNA level of the ackA gene for acetate kinase, which is co-transcribed with pta (23Reinscheid D.J. Schnicke S. Rittmann D. Zahnow U. Sahm H. Eikmanns B.J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was slightly increased in the ΔripA mutant but below the cut-off used. Except for the transporter NarK, phosphotransacetylase, and acetate kinase, the enzymes encoded by these genes are known to contain iron, mostly in the form of iron-sulfur clusters (aconitase, isopropylmalate dehydratase, nitrate reductase, succinate dehydrogenase) and/or heme (nitrate reductase, succinate dehydrogenase) (24Bott M. Niebisch A. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the mRNA level of the genes mentioned above was changed only under iron limitation but not under iron excess (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEGenes showing altered expression in the C. glutamicum ΔripA mutant compared with wild typeNCgl numberaThis column includes those genes whose average mRNA ratio (ΔripA mutant/wild type) was altered ≥1.7-fold or ≤1.7-fold (p value ≤0.05) in five DNA microarray experiments performed with RNA isolated from five independent cultivations in CGXII minimal medium under iron limitation (1 μm FeSO4).

https://openalex.org/W2158425855,"Andrew Polaszek and colleagues propose an open-access web-register for animal names, which they believe is vital to move taxonomy into the twenty-first century. The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (the fourth edition is online at http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp ) was established to bring order to the naming of animal species. It is administered by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), a body set up in 1895 to take on the task on behalf of all zoologists. In this issue of Nature, ICZN executive secretary Andrew Polaszek, together with representatives of many of the world's major natural history museums, argues the case for a major upgrade to the ‘Code’ for its next edition. ZooBank would be a web-based open-access resource, bolstered by mandatory registration for new names. ICZN has started a year-long consultation with a view to having ZooBank up and running for the 250th anniversary of Linnaeus' system of animal nomenclature in 2008."

Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). The actions of these chaperones result from cycles of substrate binding and release governed by ATP binding and hydrolysis (2Young J.C. Barral J.M. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 541-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition, the ATPase activity of these proteins can be harnessed to do conformational work on specific proteins within a variety of functional contexts, including exocytosis, endocytosis, protein transport, and assembly or disassembly of protein complexes (2Young J.C.

Biol. 2001; 23: 49-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CCVs are evolutionary conserved carriers that transport proteins and lipids from the plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to components of the endosomal system (5Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). CCVs pinch off the donor membrane encased in a coat; they must be uncoated for vesicle transport and fusion with the acceptor compartment (5Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E.

Auxilin 1 and its homolog, auxilin 2 (also known as cyclin-G-associated kinase), function to uncoat CCVs of both plasma membrane and TGN origin (7Umeda A. Meyerholz A. Ungewickell E. Eur. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1365-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Auxilins bind to the clathrin coat through interactions with the terminal domain (TD) of the clathrin heavy chain (CHC) (9Scheele U. Alves J. Frank R. Duwel M. Kalthof C. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25357-25368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and interact in an ATP-dependent manner via their DnaJ domain with Hsc70, thus recruiting the chaperone to CCVs (10Ungewickell E.

Through its ATPase activity, Hsc70 mediates the release of clathrin triskelia by disrupting CHC/CHC interactions (10Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 11Fotin A. Cheng Y. Grigorieff N. Walz T. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Nature. 2004; 432: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When ATPase-deficient forms of Hsc70 are expressed in mammalian cells, they function in a dominant-negative manner to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis (12Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and in Drosophila, Hsc70 mutants have defects in the internalization of Bride of sevenless (Boss), the ligand for the sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase (13Chang H.C. Newmyer S.L. Hull M.J. Ebersold M. Schmid S.L. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to endocytic defects, Hsc70 mutant Garland cells in Drosophila display disruptions in the organization of endosomes (13Chang H.C. Newmyer S.L. Hull M.J. Ebersold M. Schmid S.L. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and dominant-negative Hsc70 constructs cause endosomal sorting defects in mammalian cells (12Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, Hsc70 has multiple roles on the endocytic pathway including regulation of endosomal trafficking and morphology. In a screen for endocytic defects in Caenorhabditis elegans, Zhang et al. (14Zhang Y. Grant B. Hirsh D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2011-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) identified a novel DnaJ domain-bearing protein they named receptor-mediated endocytosis 8 (RME-8). RME-8 was subsequently identified in Drosophila where its disruption causes defects in fluid phase endocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis of Boss. Genetic interactions between RME-8 and Hsc70 in Drosophila suggested that RME-8 functions as a co-chaperone for Hsc70 in endocytosis (15Chang H.C. Hull M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). More recently, RME-8 was identified as the product of a gene that when defective causes gravitropism defects in Arabidopsis (16Silady R.A. Kato T. Lukowitz W. Sieber P. Tasaka M. Somerville C.R. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, RME-8 represents an evolutionarily conserved gene family thought to function widely in endocytosis, and yet there is currently no evidence regarding the protein expression or properties of a vertebrate isoform. We have now identified and functionally characterized mammalian RME-8. Consistent with its localization to endosomal membranes, loss of RME-8 function causes prominent defects in trafficking of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) between the TGN and membranes of the endosomal system. These results provide the first characterization of vertebrate RME-8 revealing an important role in intracellular membrane traffic. Antibodies and Fluorescent Probes—A rabbit polyclonal RME-8 serum was raised against a synthetic peptide, SNLPPPVDHEAGDLGYQT, containing amino acids 2226-2243 at the C terminus of human RME-8 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through an added N-terminal cysteine. A rabbit polyclonal serum against human enthoprotin/epsinR was previously described (17Burman J.L. Wasiak S. Ritter B. de Heuvel E. McPherson P.S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2177-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against CHC used for immunofluorescence was generated from the hybridoma X22 obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against CHC, syntaxin 6, early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1), Grb2, and AP-1 (γ-adaptin) were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the following proteins were from the noted commercial sources: Rab9, Abcam (Cambridge, MA); CI-MPR and AP-2 (α-adaptin), ABR (Golden, CO); Na+/K+ ATPase, Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); auxilin 2/cyclin G-associated kinase, MBL International (Woburn, MA); transferrin receptor, Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Rat monoclonal anti-Hsc70 was from StressGen (Victoria, BC), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cathepsin D and EGF receptor were from DAKOCytomation (Mississauga, ON) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. A pan-cadherin polyclonal antibody was from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing VAMP 4 and CI-MPR were generous gifts of Dr. Richard Scheller (Genentech, San Francisco, CA) and Dr. Paul Luzio (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK), respectively. Transferrin-Cy3 was from Jackson Laboratories (Mississauga, ON), and transferrin-Alexa Fluor 647, EGF-Texas Red, EGF-Alexa Fluor 488, and cholera toxin B-Alexa 594 were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). cDNA Constructs—KIAA0678, encoding a large C-terminal fragment of human RME-8, was produced by and was a generous gift of the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). The RME-8 DnaJ domain (amino acids 1302-1366; Fig. 1) was amplified from KIAA0678 by PCR and was subcloned in-frame into pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) adding an N-terminal GST tag. The terminal domain (TD) of the CHC fused to GST was previously described (18Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15017-15022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation and GST Affinity Selection Assays—Various rat tissues or cultured cells were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. Equal protein aliquots of the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. For some experiments the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, the pellet (P2) was resuspended in buffer A, and the supernatant was spun at 205,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet (P3) was resuspended in buffer A, and the supernatant was kept (S3). Equal protein aliquots of the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. For extraction experiments, kidney P3 fractions were pelleted at 245,000 × g and resuspended in buffer A, buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, or 150 mm NaCl or 500 mm NaCl or in 50 mm NaCO3, pH 11.0, and incubated on ice for 15 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 245,000 × g, and equal volume aliquots of the supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. CCVs were isolated from rat liver as described (19Pilch P.F. Shia M.A. Benson R.J. Fine R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Girard M. Allaire P.D.

Plasma membrane was isolated from rat liver as described (21Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.J. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. EMBO J. 1994; 15: 4269-4277Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar) except that the final pellet was resuspended in 1.42 m sucrose, overlaid with 1.0 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 82,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman SW28 rotor. The pellicle at the 1.0-1.42 m sucrose interface was collected, and the plasma membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g after adjusting the sucrose to 0.4 m. For affinity selection experiments with the CHC TD, soluble fractions resulting from pH 11.0 extraction of P3 pellets, as described above, were neutralized to pH 7.4 by dilution in buffer A and were then centrifuged at 245,000 × g. Triton X-100 was added to the supernatant to 1% final and 2-mg aliquots of the extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST or GST-CHC-TD precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After incubation, beads were washed with buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, and proteins specifically bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. In other experiments, adult rat kidneys were homogenized in 10 volumes of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NH2SO4, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 205,000 × g for 30 min, and 2-mg aliquots of the resulting supernatant were incubated with 10 mm EDTA or varying concentrations of adenine nucleotides for 10 min at 25 °C before incubation for 1 h at 25°C with GST-DnaJ domain fusion protein pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Incubations with ATP were performed in the presence of an ATP regenerating system. After incubation, beads were washed with buffer B with or without 0.1 mm adenine nucleotide, and specifically bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot or bands were extracted from Coomassie-stained gels and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry as described (22Blondeau F. Ritter B. Allaire P.D. Wasiak S. Girard M. Hussain N.K. Angers A. Legendre-Guillemin V. Roy L. Boismenu D. Kearney R.E. Bell A.W. Bergeron J.J. McPherson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3833-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis of RME-8 Localization—Cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were washed in PBS (20 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and then fixed for 20 min in 2% paraformaldehyde, PBS. In some cases cells were first incubated for 1 h in serum-free DMEM and then incubated with 5 μg/ml Cy3-transferrin or 100 ng/ml Texas Red-EGF for 20 min at 37 °C before fixation. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, PBS (or 0.05% saponin/PBS for AP-2 and EGF receptor) and processed for immunofluorescence with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. All immunofluorescence images presented in the study were obtained using a Zeiss 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. siRNA-mediated Knock Down of RME-8—siRNAs matching selected regions of RME-8 sequence were synthesized by Qiagen with dT overhangs already annealed. The sequences were submitted to BLAST search to ensure specificity of the target. Of the four sequences selected, one (RME-8.3) led to a decrease of RME-8 protein expression superior to 90%. The DNA target sequence of RME-8.3 was 5′-AAGCTGCTCCAGATATGAAAA-3′. For siRNA transfection, COS-7 cells were plated in DMEM without antibiotics. Cells were plated in 6-well plates or on coverslips in 24-well plates such that they would be 60% confluent 24 h post-plating. At this time, cells were transfected with siRNAs at a final concentration of 80 nm using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and transfections were repeated 24 h later. For the control, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 only. Experiments were performed 72 h after the first transfection. Analysis of EGF, Transferrin, and Cholera Toxin B Endocytosis—COS-7 cells, mock-transfected or transfected with RME-8.3 siRNA, were serum-starved for 1 h in DMEM and were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with transferrin-Cy3 (5 μg/ml), EGF-Texas Red (10 ng/ml), or cholera toxin B-Alexa 594 (5 μg/ml). Cells were processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described previously. Alternatively, cells were treated the same but were incubated with transferrin-Alexa Fluor 647 (5 μg/ml) or EGF-Alexa Fluor 488 (10 ng/ml). In these cases, one set of cells for each ligand was washed twice in PBS and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, PBS. A second set of cells was washed in acidic buffer (0.2 m acetic acid, pH 2.8, containing 0.5 m NaCl) for 15 min at 4 °C to strip cell surface EGF or transferrin, and the cells were then washed twice in PBS and fixed as above. The levels of fluorescent EGF and transferrin were assessed using a FACScan with data analyzed using the CellQuantPro program (BD Biosciences). The percentage of ligand internalized was determined by dividing the amount of ligand in cells (acid-washed samples) versus total ligand (cells washed with PBS alone) for 10,000 cells. Cathepsin D Sorting Assay—COS-7 cells mock-transfected or transfected with RME-8.3 siRNA were washed and placed in cysteine/methionine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then pulsed for 10 min with 0.25 mCi/ml Pro-Mix [35S] (Amersham Biosciences), washed, and chased in DMEM with 1% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm mannose-6-phosphate and 1 mm methionine. At 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-h time points, media were collected, cell lysates were prepared, and cathepsin D was immunoprecipitated as described (23Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and processed for autoradiography using a STORM PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to x-ray film. Quantitation was performed using ImageQuant software. Identification of Mammalian RME-8—A proteomic analysis of CCVs isolated from rat liver identified proteins that are predicted products of cDNAs and genomic sequence (24Girard M. Allaire P.D. McPherson P.S. Blondeau F. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1145-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). One such protein, identified in the annotated rat genome under gi27721389, is the rat homolog of RME-8. The rat sequence could be aligned with fly and worm orthologs with the exception of the N-terminal-most 448 amino acids. Three overlapping human clones (gi3327169, gi18799409, gi15948602) were aligned to predict a protein (Fig. 1) with homology to full-length invertebrate forms. When this sequence was searched against the human genome using the blat algorithm, a series of 56 exons from region q22.1 of chromosome 3 could be annotated to reveal a sequence that was identical to the sequence predicted from the overlapping clones. siRNAs targeting each of the three clones were effective in reducing the expression of the endogenous protein in COS-7 cells as detected with a polyclonal antibody against a C-terminal peptide (see Fig. 6 and data not shown). The human RME-8 sequence (entered into GenBank™ under accession number AY779857) encodes a 2243-amino acid protein that is 46, 43, and 28% identical throughout its length to Drosophila, C. elegans, and Arabidopsis RME-8, respectively. As originally described for the C. elegans protein (14Zhang Y. Grant B. Hirsh D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2011-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), human RME-8 has a central DnaJ domain flanked on either side by two IWN repeats of unknown function (Fig. 1). RME-8 is detected as a protein of ∼220 kDa in most tissues and cell lines examined (Fig. 2, A and B). A reactive band seen in selective extracts at ∼140 kDa may represent a proteolytic fragment or an alternatively spliced form of RME-8 (Fig. 2). Subcellular fractionation of kidney extracts reveals that RME-8 is enriched in P3 microsomes with no protein detectable in a cytosolic (S3) fraction, whereas the plasma membrane protein cadherin is enriched in P1 and P2 fractions that sediment at lower g forces (Fig. 2C). Purified plasma membrane that is highly enriched for cadherin and EGF receptor has a relatively weak RME-8 signal (Fig. 2D). RME-8 does not extract from microsomal fractions after treatment with 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, or 500 mm NaCl but is partially extracted by sodium carbonate, pH 11.0 (Fig. 2E). The integral membrane protein Na+/K+ ATPase is resistant to NaCl and pH 11.0 but is extracted with 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 2E). Thus, RME-8 appears to be an extrinsic membrane protein tightly associated with a Triton X-100-insoluble microsomal compartment. RME-8 Binds through Its DnaJ Domain to Hsc70—To further characterize mammalian RME-8, we sought to identify RME-8-binding partners. We first performed pull-down assays from kidney extracts using a GST-RME-8-DnaJ domain fusion protein in the presence or absence of ATP. Coomassie Blue staining revealed a single affinity selected band at ∼70 kDa only in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3A). Tandem mass spectrometry identified Hsc70 with 33 unique peptides, consistent with the observation that Drosophila RME-8 binds to Hsc70 in vitro (15Chang H.C. Hull M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, for Drosophila RME-8, binding was dependent on the presence of ADP. This is surprising because proteins bearing DnaJ domains generally bind to heat shock protein 70 family members when the chaperones are in their ATP-bound state (3Kelley W.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 305-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We, thus, examined the interaction of human RME-8 with Hsc70 under different nucleotide conditions. Incubation of GST-RME-8-DnaJ domain with kidney extracts in the presence of ATP led to an efficient affinity selection of Hsc70 with less binding observed in the presence of ADP and only weak binding seen in the presence of EDTA, which chelates Mg2+, leaving Hsc70 in a nucleotide-free state (Fig. 3B). This ATP-dependent interaction is direct, as was verified using purified His-tagged Hsc70 (data not shown), and is dose-dependent, with maximal binding observed between 1 and 5 mm (Fig. 3C), comparable with ATP concentrations required for auxilin interactions with Hsc70 (8Greener T. Zhao X. Nojima H. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1365-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that mammalian RME-8 interacts with Hsc70 in an ATP-dependent manner. Attempts to identify additional binding partners for RME-8 have been unsuccessful in that the large size of the protein has made it difficult to generate constructs for additional affinity selection experiments, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments are complicated by the fact that the endogenous protein can only be solubilized under conditions that are likely to disrupt protein-protein interactions (Fig. 2E). The auxilins, which bind to Hsc70 via a DnaJ domain, also bind to the TD of the CHC and function in the uncoating of CCVs by recruiting Hsc70 to clathrin coats (4Lemmon S.K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 23: 49-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The identification of mammalian RME-8 on CCVs and the presence within the protein of four potential type II clathrin boxes (LLDFL, LLEMV, LLEFL, LLDYI; Fig. 1), interaction motifs for the CHC TD (25Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26ter Haar E. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28700-28709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggest that RME-8 could function analogously to auxilins. To address this issue, we first tested if RME-8 binds to the CHC TD. Proteins were extracted from kidney P3 microsomes with NaCO3 buffer, pH 11.0, and the extracts were subsequently adjusted to pH 7.4 and incubated with a GST-CHC-TD. RME-8 failed to bind the TD, whereas enthoprotin/epsinR and the clathrin adaptor protein 1, which bind to the TD through type II clathrin boxes in whole or in part, respectively (28Wasiak S. Legendre-Guillemin V. Puertollano R. Blondeau F. Girard M. de Heuvel E. Boismenu D. Bell A.W. Bonifacino J.S. McPherson P.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 29Doray B. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1925-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), both bound in the same experiment (Fig. 4A). Moreover, whereas RME-8 is present on CCVs purified from liver, consistent with its identification in this organelle, it was not enriched (Fig. 4B). Neuron-specific auxilin 1 (30Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and ubiquitously distributed auxilin 2/cyclin-G-associated kinase (Fig. 4B) are both highly enriched on CCVs. Thus, RME-8 is unlikely to function analogously to auxilins in the uncoating of CCVs. Localization of Endogenous RME-8 in Mammalian Cells—Studies in invertebrates demonstrated that GFP-RME-8 was localized to endosomal structures in coelomocytes of C. elegans (14Zhang Y. Grant B. Hirsh D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2011-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and that RFP-RME-8 partially overlaps with GFP-tagged Rab5 and Rab7 in Garland cells of Drosophila (15Chang H.C. Hull M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Confocal immunofluorescence analysis of COS-7 (Fig. 5) and HeLa cells (data not shown) reveals that endogenous mammalian RME-8 has a distributed punctate pattern with accumulation of larger puncta in a perinuclear region. RME-8 puncta are partially co-localized with EEA1 (Fig. 5A) and transferrin that has been endocytosed for 20 min (Fig. 5B), indicating that pools of the protein are present on early and recycling endosomes. RME-8 also co-localizes with the CI-MPR (Fig. 5C) and is found in puncta surrounding puncta of Texas Red-EGF after 20 min of endocytic uptake (Fig. 5D), suggesting that pools of RME-8 are present on late endosomes. That RME-8 puncta surround EGF may reflect the presence of EGF within the lumen of the late endosome with RME-8 on the limiting membrane, and in fact, endocytosed EGF can even be seen in many cases to be adjacent to or surrounded by the EGF receptor (Fig. 5E). Little co-localization is seen between RME-8 and syntaxin 6, a TGN marker, and no co-localization is seen with LAMP1, a marker of lysosomes (data not shown). Moreover, RME-8 does not co-localize with AP-2, indicating that it is not a component of clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane (Supplemental Fig. 1). Together"
https://openalex.org/W2011393081,"Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia is characterized by a cell type-specific defect in low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) endocytosis. LDLR-mediated uptake of LDL is impaired in the liver, but not in fibroblasts of subjects with this disorder. The disease is caused by mutations in ARH, which encodes a putative adaptor protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the LDLR, phospholipids, and two components of the clathrin endocytic machinery, clathrin and adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) in vitro. To determine the physiological relevance of these interactions, we examined the effect of mutations in the ARH on LDLR location and function in polarized hepatocytes (WIF-B). The integrity of the FDNPVY sequence in the LDLR cytoplasmic tail was required for ARH-associated LDLR clustering into clathrin-coated pits. The phosphotyrosine binding domain of ARH plus either the clathrin box or the AP-2 binding region were required for both clustering and internalization of the LDLR. Parallel studies performed in vivo with the same recombinant forms of ARH in livers of Arh-/- mice confirmed the relevance of the cell culture findings. These results demonstrate that ARH must bind the LDLR tail and either clathrin or AP-2 to promote receptor clustering and internalization of LDL.

Approximately 70% of plasma cholesterol circulates as a constituent of human low density lipoproteins (LDL). 3The abbreviations used are: LDLlow density lipoproteinARHautosomal recessive hypercholesterolemiaCCPclathrin-coated pitLDLRlow density lipoprotein receptorPTBphosphotyrosine bindingPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminPFAparaformaldehydemAbmonoclonal antibodyFHfamilial hypercholesterolemiaFDBfamilial defective apolipoprotein B-100.3The abbreviations used are: LDLlow density lipoproteinARHautosomal recessive hypercholesterolemiaCCPclathrin-coated pitLDLRlow density lipoprotein receptorPTBphosphotyrosine bindingPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminPFAparaformaldehydemAbmonoclonal antibodyFHfamilial hypercholesterolemiaFDBfamilial defective apolipoprotein B-100. The primary route of clearance of LDL from the plasma is by LDL receptor (LDLR)-mediated endocytosis in the liver. The critical role of the LDLR pathway is illustrated by the very high plasma levels of LDL that characterize three genetic disorders in which LDLR-mediated endocytosis is disrupted: familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB), and autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia. FH is an autosomal co-dominant disorder caused by mutations in the LDLR gene (1Goldstein J. Hobbs H. Brown M. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York2001: 2683-2913Google Scholar). Individuals with homozygous FH inherit two defective LDLR alleles and have markedly reduced LDL clearance, resulting in a ∼6-fold increase in plasma LDL-cholesterol levels. Fibroblasts and lymphocytes cultured from patients with homozygous FH also fail to internalize and degrade LDL. FDB is an autosomal dominant phenocopy of FH caused by missense mutations in apolipoprotein B-100 that impair binding of LDL to the LDLR (2Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Bersot T.P.

Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia is caused by mutations in ARH, a putative adaptor protein that is required for normal clearance of LDL from the circulation (3Garcia C.K. Wilund K. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Maioli M. Calandra S. Bertolini S. Cossu F. Grishin N. Barnes R. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2001; 292: 1394-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Subjects with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia, like those with FH and FDB, are hypercholesterolemic and have markedly reduced rates of clearance of circulating LDL (4Harada-Shiba M.

Although LDL degradation is reduced in the liver (5Zuliani G. Arca M. Signore A. Bader G. Fazio S. Chianelli M. Bellosta S. Campagna F. Montali A. Maioli M. Pacifico A. Ricci G. Fellin R.

In wild-type mice, approximately two-thirds of the hepatic LDLRs are intracellular, whereas in Arh-/- mice the majority of immunodetectable LDLRs are located on the sinusoidal membrane (9Jones C. Hammer R.E. Li W.P. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29024-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes of subjects with ARH, a similar redistribution of LDLRs to the plasma membrane occurs, resulting in a 16-fold increase in cell surface receptor number (10Michaely P. Li W.P.

These observations indicate that ARH is required for the normal transit of LDLR from the cell surface to endosomes. One possibility is that ARH may serve to escort LDLR to clathrin-coated pits. Alternatively ARH may stabilize the association of the LDLR within coated pits as a prerequisite to efficient internalization, or play a role in the early events of endocytosis (10Michaely P. Li W.P.

Data from in vitro pull-down experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that ARH functions as an endocytic adaptor that links the LDLR to structural components of the coated pit (11Mishra S.K.

ARH has at least four highly conserved regions beginning with a sequence of ∼40 amino acids at the N terminus of the protein that has no known function. Amino acids 44-178 encode a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain that binds the internalization sequence (FDNPVY) in the LDLR cytoplasmic tail (11Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Residues 212-216 comprise a canonical clathrin box sequence (LLDLE) that mediates high affinity binding to the terminal domain of the heavy chain of clathrin (11Mishra S.K. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 315-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Following the clathrin box motif, the protein has a highly conserved amino acid sequence (residues 252-268) that binds the β2-adaptin subunit of the adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) (13He G. Gupta S.

Together these findings suggest that ARH couples the LDLR to the endocytic machinery, but the physiological significance of these interactions have not been confirmed in cultured hepatocytes or in vivo. To address the physiological role of ARH, we compared LDLR localization and internalization in polarized hepatocytes (WIF-B cells) (16Cassio D. Hamon-Benais C. Guerin M. Lecoq O. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1397-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) overexpressing wild-type or one of several mutant forms of ARH with impaired binding to the LDLR, to clathrin or to AP-2. The ability of these ARH proteins to support LDL clearance in vivo was also examined by expressing these proteins in mice lacking ARH (Arh-/- mice) (9Jones C. Hammer R.E. Li W.P. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29024-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the PTB domain, the clathrin box, and the AP-2 binding motif of ARH interact in a combinatorial fashion to promote the localization of LDLR to clathrin-coated pits and the clearance of circulating LDL by the liver. Materials—All cell culture reagents used in these studies were purchased from Sigma. The rabbit anti-LDLR polyclonal antibody used for immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy was obtained from Maine Biotechnology Services, Inc. (Portland, ME), and the mouse monoclonal antibody to the LDLR (IgG-C7) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (17Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two rabbit polyclonal anti-ARH antibodies were used in these studies: an antibody directed against the 15 C-terminal amino acids in ARH, which does not recognize mouse or rat ARH (7Wilund K.R. Yi M. Campagna F. Arca M. Zuiliani G. Fellin R. Ho Y.-K. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3019-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and an antibody raised against the full-length recombinant human protein that cross-reacts with rat ARH. The mouse monoclonal anti-α-adaptin (AP.6) was from BD Transduction Laboratories and mouse monoclonal anti-clathrin heavy chain (X22) was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Anderson (UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and 10-nm gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Hatfield, PA). Cholesterol measurements were determined enzymatically using an assay kit from Roche Applied Science. Cell Culture—WIF-B cells represent a fusion cell line between human fibroblasts and rat hepatocytes (16Cassio D. Hamon-Benais C. Guerin M. Lecoq O. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1397-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); the cells were a generous gift from Dr. Ann Hubbard (Johns Hopkins University). Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 7% CO2/air in modified F12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and HAT (10 mm hypoxanthine, 4 nm aminopterin, 1.6 mm thymidine) as described (18Ihrke G. Neufeld E.B. Meads T. Shanks M.R. Cassio D. Laurent M. Schroer T.A. Pagano R.E. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1761-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cultures were split and passaged using standard trypsinization procedures and used between passages 7 and 15. Cells were grown on glass coverslips and used at maximal density and polarity, typically after 8-10 days of culture. Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviral vectors containing the cDNA of the wild-type human LDLR and the mutant human LDLR-Y807A were generated by in vitro Cre-lox recombination (19Aoki K. Barker C. Danthinne X. Imperiale M.J. Nabel G.J. Mol Med. 1999; 5: 224-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant tetracycline-inducible viruses containing either wild-type or mutant ARH were constructed using pACtreCMV and pBHGCMVrtTA plasmids kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Newgard (Duke University, Durham, NC). Homologous recombination in 911 cells (20Fallaux F.J. Bout A. van der Velde I. van den Wollenberg D.J. Hehir K.M. Keegan J. Auger C. Cramer S.J. van Ormondt H. van der Eb A.J. Valerio D. Hoeben R.C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) was used to construct recombinant tet-inducible viruses, which were cloned, amplified, and purified as previously described (21Gerard R.D. Meidell R.S. Adenoviral Vectors. Adenine Press, Oxford1995: 285-307Google Scholar). Infection and Immunofluorescence—Eight days after plating cells on coverslips, the WIF-B cells were washed with PBS (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3) and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium with 6 × 109 viral particles. The cells were washed again and refed with complete medium. The following day, the cells were incubated with doxycycline (20 ng/ml) for 6 h. The coverslips were then rinsed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS at 4 °C for 5 min. The non-permeabilized cells were rinsed twice in PBS and incubated in 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS (Buffer A) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with either IgG-C7 (20 μg/ml) or rabbit anti-human LDLR IgG (0.5 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature in Buffer A. The coverslips were rinsed with 0.1% BSA in PBS (Buffer B) and permeabilized in methanol at 4 °C for 10 min before addition of Buffer A and a second antibody: either of the two rabbit anti-ARH antibodies (1:200 dilution), or an anti-α-adaptin or anti-clathrin heavy chain monoclonal antibodies (1:100 dilution). The coverslips were rinsed with Buffer B and then incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1 μg/ml). The coverslips were rinsed in Buffer B prior to mounting and imaging the sections using a 100 × 1.3 objective on a confocal microscope (Leica TCS_SP). To examine LDLR internalization, cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus as described above. The cells were then washed with cold PBS, placed on ice, and allowed to bind IgG-C7 in Buffer A for 45 min before washing and incubating at 37 °C in antibody-free medium for 20 min. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and processed for immunofluorescence. Immunoblot Analysis—WIF-B cells were plated and grown to confluence in 6-well plates, as described previously. After infection with adenoviruses, the cells were harvested, and lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using rabbit polyclonal anti-human LDLR or rabbit polyclonal anti-human ARH antibodies (7Wilund K.R. Yi M. Campagna F. Arca M. Zuiliani G. Fellin R. Ho Y.-K. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3019-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis on liver cell extracts from Arh-/- mice was performed as described previously (9Jones C. Hammer R.E. Li W.P. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29024-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—WIF-B cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes to 95% confluence and infected with adenoviruses (see above). After 12 h, the cells were harvested in PBS, washed in Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS), and processed for immunoelectron microscopy as described (10Michaely P. Li W.P. Anderson R.G. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34023-34031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For LDL internalization colloidal gold-conjugated LDL was produced as described previously (22Pathak R.K. Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The colloidal gold-labeled LDL was used within 5 days of synthesis. Infected WIF-B cells were incubated at 4 °C in serum-free medium prior to addition of 10 μg/ml colloidal gold-labeled LDL. The cells were maintained at 37 °C for 90 min and then washed three times using 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4. Cells were fixed, embedded, sectioned, and placed on nickel grids as described (23Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1980; 12: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 24Tokuyasu K.T. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1978; 63: 287-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were taken using a JEOL 1200 electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Quantification of Gold Labeling—Electron microscope images were obtained by taking 25 photographs of each cell type. The length of the non-coated pit membranes, the diameter of the coated pits, and the number of gold particles associated with each region were determined. The labeling intensity was expressed as the number of gold particles per micrometer length of the different regions of the plasma membrane. In Vivo Complementation of ARH Function in Mice—Mice with a targeted disruption of Arh (9Jones C. Hammer R.E. Li W.P. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29024-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were maintained on a hybrid background of C57Bl/6 and 126sv strains. The mice were housed on a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle and maintained on standard chow (number 7002: Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) and water ad libitum. To induce hypercholesterolemia, the Arh-/- mice (aged 12-16 weeks) were fed normal chow diets supplemented with 2% cholesterol and 21% anhydrous milk fat for 3-5 weeks. On Day 0 the mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (100 μg/g body weight) and ∼100 μl of blood was obtained via retro-orbital puncture. Recombinant adenovirus was then injected into the external jugular vein as a single dose (2 × 1011 pfu in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.2% (w/v) BSA) (25Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). After recovery from anesthesia, mice were maintained on the 2% cholesterol diet until Day 4 post-injection, when the animals were sacrificed. Because ARH expression from the recombinant adenovirus was sufficient to restore LDLR endocytosis in the Arh-/- mice without addition of doxycycline, no doxycycline was supplied to the mice. Blood samples were drawn from the inferior vena cava for measurement of plasma cholesterol levels. The livers were removed, and immunoblot analysis of ARH was performed on tissue lysates to confirm ARH expression. Animal experiments were approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were performed according to all federal animal welfare policies and regulations. Immunolocalization of Endogenous LDLR and ARH—WIF-B cells are an immortalized cell line derived from the fusion of rat hepatocytes with human fibroblasts (16Cassio D. Hamon-Benais C. Guerin M. Lecoq O. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1397-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cells polarize in culture, providing a model system for the study of membrane protein trafficking (18Ihrke G. Neufeld E.B. Meads T. Shanks M.R. Cassio D. Laurent M. Schroer T.A. Pagano R.E. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1761-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) including the LDLR (26Koivisto U.M. Hubbard A.L. Mellman I. Cell. 2001; 105: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Human chromosomes 19 and 1 are not retained in this cell line (16Cassio D. Hamon-Benais C. Guerin M. Lecoq O. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1397-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) so these cells do not synthesize human LDLR or ARH. To determine the cell surface location of the endogenous LDLR in polarized WIF-B cells, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy in non-permeabilized cells, using an anti-LDLR antibody that interacts with the rat LDLR. The cells were then permeabilized and stained with antibodies against the α-subunit of AP-2 and the heavy chain of clathrin (clathrin-HC). The plasma membrane-associated LDLR was located on the basolateral surfaces and only partially co-localized with AP-2 or with clathrin-HC (Fig. 1A). To determine the location of endogenous ARH in WIF-B cells, permeabilized WIF-B cells were stained with antibodies to ARH and to either AP-2 or clathrin-HC. With all three antibodies, staining was present in the cytoplasm and associated with the basolateral membrane. The majority of ARH staining on the plasma membrane colocalized with AP-2 and clathrin-HC, suggesting that the ARH associated with the plasma membrane was predominantly, though not exclusively, localized to clathrin-coated pits in these cells (Fig. 1B). Immunolocalization of Recombinant LDLR and ARH in WIF-B Cells—To examine the molecular basis for the interactions between ARH and the LDLR, we infected WIF-B cells with a recombinant adenovirus expressing the human LDLR (AdLDLR). The cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-human LDLR antibody (IgG-C7) before permeabilization. The cells were then permeabilized and incubated with antibodies to aminopeptidase-N (APN), AP-2, clathrin-HC, and ARH, and processed for visualization using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. The human LDLR was expressed only on the basolateral membrane (Fig. 2). No co-localization with APN, an apical membrane protein (Fig. 2A) was seen, which is consistent with previous observations (26Koivisto U.M. Hubbard A.L. Mellman I. Cell. 2001; 105: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Anti-LDLR staining was uniformly distributed along the basolateral membrane, whereas the staining patterns of AP-2, clathrin, and ARH were more punctuate (Fig. 2B). Thus, the distribution of the recombinant LDLR on the cell surface resembled that of the endogenous LDLR protein (Fig. 2B). Expression of Recombinant ARH Does Not Alter the Cellular Localization of AP-2 or Clathrin-HC—High level expression of the adaptor proteins epsin 2, synaptojanin, and Dab2 disrupts AP-2 localization (27Morris S.M. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 28Haffner C. Di Paolo G. Rosenthal J.A. de Camilli P. Curr.

In contrast to these findings, we did not observe changes in the distribution of AP-2 or clathrin with the overexpression of recombinant human ARH in WIF-B cells (AdARH) (Fig. 3). The recombinant ARH was predominantly cytoplasmic but some signal was also apparent at the plasma membrane. The membrane-associated recombinant ARH appeared to co-localize extensively with AP-2 and clathrin-HC (Fig. 3). Expression of Recombinant ARH Results in Cell Surface Clustering of LDLR—First we examined the effect of ARH overexpression on the cell surface localization of the endogenous LDLR. WIF-B cells were infected with AdARH or an adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (AdβGal). No changes in the cell surface or intracellular distribution of the LDLR were seen (data not shown). Next we examined the LDLR localization in WIF-B cells expressing both human ARH and LDLR by infecting the WIF-B cells with AdLDLR and either AdARH or AdβGal. Expression of LDLR with the control virus resulted in diffuse LDLR staining on the basolateral surface. In contrast, co-expression of ARH with LDLR resulted in punctate staining, suggesting that ARH promotes clustering of LDLR (Fig. 4A). The FDNPVY motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the LDLR plays a key role in LDLR internalization (30Davis C.G. van Driel I.R. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4075-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and binds to recombinant ARH in vitro (13He G. Gupta S. Michaely P. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44044-44049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To determine if the integrity of the FDNPVY motif is required for cell surface clustering of the LDLR in response to ARH expression, we infected WIF-B cells with adenoviruses expressing a mutant form of the LDLR that abolishes association between ARH and LDLR peptide in vitro (Y807A) (13He G. Gupta S. Michaely P. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44044-44049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the absence of ARH overexpression, LDLR staining was diffusely distributed on the cell surface in cells expressing either the wild-type LDLR or LDLR-Y807A. Co-expression of ARH resulted in clustering of the LDLR in cells expressing wild-type LDLR but not in the cells expressing LDLR-Y807A (Fig. 4A). The expression of ARH and LDLR was similar in the two sets of cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, the ability of ARH to drive LDLR clustering in the WIF-B cells required the integrity of the FDNPVY internalization sequence in the LDLR cytoplasmic tail. Expression of ARH Promotes Clustering of the LDLR in Clathrin-coated Pits and LDLR Internalization—Immunofluorescence microscopy did not provide sufficient resolution to determine if the punctuate pattern of anti-LDLR staining in the WIF-B cells expressing ARH and LDLR reflected clustering of LDLR in coated pits. Therefore, we performed immunoelectron microscopy to localize the LDLR on the cell surface. In WIF-B cells infected with AdLDLR and AdβGal, the immunogold labeling of LDLR showed an even distribution along the plasma membrane with most of the staining outside the clathrin-coated pits (Fig. 5). In contrast to these findings, the immunogold particles clustered into coated pits, in cells co-expressing LDLR and ARH. The quantification of immunogold particles on the cell surface revealed a ∼33-fold increase in the number of LDLRs/μm of coated pit membrane (TABLE ONE). Thus, the expression of ARH resulted in a redistribution of LDLR from the non-coated pit portion of the plasma membrane to coated pits. The number of LDLRs per micrometer of plasma membrane was reduced ∼9-fold in cells expressing both ARH and the LDLR. These results are consistent with ARH increasing internalization of LDLR, because overexpression of ARH did not change the total amount of LDLR in cells (Fig. 4B).TABLE ONEQuantification of gold LDLRs on the surface of WIF-B cells using immunoelectron microscopyAdenovirusnan is the number of i"
https://openalex.org/W2119652242,"The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Nef protein, originally identified as a negative factor, has now emerged as one of the most important viral proteins necessary for viral pathogenesis and disease progression. Nef has been also implicated in viral infectivity and replication, however, the molecular mechanism of Nef-induced viral gene expression and replication is not clearly understood. Although involvement of heat shock proteins in viral pathogenesis has been reported earlier, a clear understanding of their role remains to be elucidated. Here we report for the first time that Nef not only interacts with heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) but it also induces the expression of Hsp40 in HIV-1-infected cells. The interaction between Nef and Hsp40 is important for increased Hsp40 translocation into the nucleus of infected cells, which seems to facilitate viral gene expression by becoming part of the cyclin-dependent kinase 9-associated transcription complex regulating long terminal repeat-mediated gene expression. The finding is consistent with the failure of the nef-deleted virus to induce Hsp40, resulting in reduced virus production. Our data further shows that, whereas, Hsp40 overexpression induces viral gene expression, silencing of Hsp40 reduces the gene expression in a Nef-dependent manner. Thus our results clearly indicate that Hsp40 is crucial for Nef-mediated enhancement of viral gene expression and replication.

Nef, a 27-30-kDa myristoylated phosphoprotein, encoded by HIV-1 has been shown to play a crucial role in viral pathogenesis by modulating cellular gene expression and signaling pathways (1Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: d606-d618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Simmons A. Aluvihare V. McMichael A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 763-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). nef-deleted viruses fail to replicate efficiently in vivo, and do not develop symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (3Geyer M. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Greene W.C. Peterlin B.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Nef is also thought to contribute to viral pathogenesis by down-regulation of CD4 and major histocompatibility complex class I surface molecules preventing viral superinfection and by helping the virus to evade host immune system. Nef has also been implicated in the activation of T cells, making the cells permissible to the virus (5Doms R.W. Trono D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 6Fackler O.T. Baur A.S. Immunity. 2002; 16: 493-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). All these functions of Nef are manifested by a number of important events such as activation of upstream signaling molecules, inhibition of apoptosis in the infected cell, activation and up-regulation of transcription factors, alleviation of repressors of transcription, as well as increase of the infectivity of newly produced virions (1Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: d606-d618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Arora V.K. Fredericksen B.L. Garcia J.V. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Even though these functions of Nef have been well studied, controversy exists on its role in viral infectivity and replication as both negative (8Fackler O.T. d'Aloja P. Baur A.S. Federico M.

Although a number of reports show that Nef increases viral replication by activating T cells, the molecular basis of Nef-induced viral gene expression and replication remains to be clearly elucidated. human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside heat shock protein positive transcription elongation factor b hemagglutinin cyclin-dependent kinase 9 glutathione S-transferase long terminal repeat green fluorescent protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay peripheral blood mononuclear cells small interfering RNA reverse transcriptase. human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside heat shock protein positive transcription elongation factor b hemagglutinin cyclin-dependent kinase 9 glutathione S-transferase long terminal repeat green fluorescent protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay peripheral blood mononuclear cells small interfering RNA reverse transcriptase. Cellular heat shock proteins (Hsp) are chaperone molecules known to participate in protein folding, transport, and assembly. Hsps are induced in cells during stress conditions like heat shock, UV irradiation, and even microbial/viral infections (12Creagh E.M. Sheehan D. Cotter T.G. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Brenner B.G. Wainberg Z. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2001; 1: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that Hsps are also involved in apoptosis and immune response (14Takayama S. Reed J.C. Homma S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9041-9047Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 15van Eden W. van der Zee R. Prakken B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, expression of a number of Hsps, including Hsp40, Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp100, is enhanced by heat shock and regulated at the transcriptional level (16Welch W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Hsp40, a heat-inducible DnaJ homologue, has been found to co-localize with Hsp70 (17Yamane M. Hattori H. Sugito K.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Among all the heat shock proteins studied to date, Hsp70 has been shown to play an important role in the HIV-1 life cycle. Hsp70 is overexpressed in lymphocytes of HIV-positive individuals and is also found abundantly in HIV virions (23Agnew L.L. Kelly M. Howard J. Jeganathan S. Batterham M. Ffrench R.A. Gold J. Watson K. AIDS. 2003; 17: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Gurer C. Cimarelli A. Luban J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Hsp70 and Hsp90 have been shown to stabilize the assembly of the active cdk9-cyclin T1 complex responsible for positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) or Tat-associated kinase complex-mediated Tat transactivation (25O'Keeffe B. Fong Y. Chen D. Zhou S. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 279-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, the role of Hsp40 in the HIV life cycle remains to be studied. Nef was previously reported as a negative factor for viral replication in T cell lines (26Niederman T.M. Thielan B.J. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), but recent reports demonstrated Nef as an enhancer of viral replication (27Glushakova S. Grivel J.C. Suryanarayana K. Meylan P. Lifson J.D. Desrosiers R. Margolis L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3968-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Papkalla A. Munch J. Otto C. Kirchhoff F. J.

HIV Res. 2005; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of this positive effect needs to be clearly elucidated. It is well known that Nef performs most of its functions by interacting with different proteins (1Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: d606-d618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Arora V.K. Fredericksen B.L. Garcia J.V. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the functions attributed to Nef remain conserved across different HIV-1 subtypes, most of the functional studies for Nef to date have been performed with subtype B Nef protein. There is scant literature regarding subtype C Nef, the most prevalent subtype in the world. In the reported study, we have attempted to identify novel Nef interacting host cell factors using subtype C Nef as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Our results showed that both subtype C and subtype B Nef interacted with a human DnaJ homologue, Hsp40, in vitro and in vivo. This interaction led to increased viral gene expression and virus production. Furthermore, Hsp40 expression was increased in HIV-1-infected cells in a Nef-dependent manner and this up-regulation was necessary for increased viral replication. Finally, Hsp40 seems to form part of the cdk9-associated transcription complex that regulates viral gene expression; an observation that provides a molecular basis for Nef-mediated enhancement of viral gene expression and replication. Plasmids, Cell Lines, and Antibodies—The nef gene from HIV-1 subtype C Indian isolate IN301904 (32Lole K.S. Bollinger R.C. Paranjape R.S. Gadkari D. Kulkarni S.S. Novak N.G. Ingersoll R. Sheppard H.W. Ray S.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 152-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the following primers: subtype C Nef, forward, 5′-GAGGATCCCGATGGGGGGCAAG-3′; and reverse, 5′-CGGAATTCGCATGTCAGCAGTC-3′. This PCR product was first cloned into pGEMT Easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The subtype C Nef fragment was taken from pGEMT Easy-NefC and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The pAS2-1NefC expression vector was constructed by cloning subtype C Nef from pGEMT Easy-NefC into BamHI and SalI sites of pAS2-1 (Clontech). The sequence of cloned nef was confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer, ABI). Expression of Nef from both vectors was confirmed by immunoblotting. The pAS2-1NefC plasmid expresses subtype C Nef and Gal4 DNA binding domain as a fusion protein, which was used as the bait protein in yeast two-hybrid library screening. A cDNA library of human leukocytes in the pACT2 vector was obtained from Clontech. pCDNA-Hsp40, pCDNA3 expressing human Hsp40, was a kind gift of Dr. Margarida D. Amaral (33Farinha C.M. Nogueira P. Mendes F. Penque D. Amaral M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 797-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NL4-3 Nef cloned in pCDNA (pCDNA-Nef) and NL4-3 Nef tagged with HA (HA-Nef) plasmids were kind gifts of Dr. M. Federico and Dr. W. C. Greene, respectively. The NL4-3 molecular clone (pNL4-3) was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS repository (34Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nef-deleted NL4-3 molecular clone (pNL4-3ΔNef) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Nef plasmids were obtained from Dr. K. Saksela. 293T cells (human embryonic kidney cell line) were obtained from the NCCS Cell Repository, India. CEM-GFP, a CD4+ human T cell line, was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS repository (35Gervaix A. West D. Leoni L.M. Richman D.D. Wong-Staal F. Corbeil J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4653-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Monoclonal and polyclonal Nef antibodies were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS repository (36Ovod V. Lagerstedt A. Ranki A. Gombert F.O. Spohn R. Tahtinen M. Jung G. Krohn K.J. AIDS. 1992; 6: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Shugars D.C. Smith M.S. Glueck D.H. Nantermet P.V. Seillier-Moiseiwitsch F. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4639-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against Hsp40, Hsp70, Hsp90, cdk9, and rabbit anti-HA antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—A human leukocyte cDNA library in pACT2 vector (Clontech) was screened for Nef interacting proteins by co-transformation with the pAS2-1NefC bait plasmid into yeast strain AH109 (Clontech). Positive clones were selected based on growth in medium lacking adenine, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine and also by expression of β-galactosidase, which gives a blue color on plates containing X-gal. Co-transformants in AH109 yeast strains were screened three times for growth on these selection plates and also for β-galactosidase activity on plates to exclude false positive clones. Liquid β-galactosidase assay was finally performed to confirm the interaction, using the yeast β-galactosidase assay kit from Pierce, as per the manufacturer's protocol. The interacting protein in the positive clone was identified by rescuing the gene fragment, using PCR amplification with pACT2-specific primers followed by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HEK-293T cells were transfected with LTR-reporter vector (pLTR-Luc) along with other expression vectors using calcium phosphate precipitation and harvested 36 h post-transfection for luciferase assay. After 4 h of transfection, the transfected cells were either treated or mock treated with HSP inhibitor KNK437 (Calbiochem) at 100 μm final concentration for 32 h. The cells were then lysed in cell lysis reagent (Promega), and luciferase assays were performed using Luclite substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Normalization of transfection efficiency was done using the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter (pEGFP-N1) co-transfection and quantitation as described earlier (38Dandekar D.H. Kumar M. Ladha J.S. Ganesh K.N. Mitra D. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 342: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The culture supernatants were also collected at the time of luciferase assay from HIV-1 NL4-3 and the nef-deleted NL4-3 molecular clone-transfected cells to determine virus production. HIV-1 Infection and Virus Quantitation—5 × 106 CEM-GFP cells were infected with HIV-1 NL4-3 virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 in the presence of Polybrene (1 μg/ml) as described earlier (39Liu D. Donegan J. Nuovo G. Mitra D. Laurence J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4079-4085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peripheral blood was collected from normal seronegative donors and PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences) gradient centrifugation. Cells were activated with 5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) for 36-48 h. 5 × 106 activated PBMCs were infected with 0.5 multiplicity of infection of NL4-3 virus for 4 h in the presence of Polybrene (1 μg/ml) with intermittent mixing as described earlier (39Liu D. Donegan J. Nuovo G. Mitra D. Laurence J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4079-4085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, the cells were plated in Complete medium supplemented with human interleukin-2 (Roche Applied Bioscience) at 20 units/ml concentrations and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. The culture supernatants from infected and molecular clone-transfected cells were used to determine virus production by p24gag antigen capture ELISA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation, GST Pull-down, and Immunoblotting—Recombinant [35S]methionine-labeled Nef and Hsp40 proteins were synthesized from pCDNA-NefC and pCDNA-Hsp40 plasmids using the coupled in vitro transcription and translation kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). These proteins were incubated together in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and were then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibody against Nef. The antigen-antibody complex was pulled down by an equal mixture of protein A- and protein G-agarose beads and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was then prepared for fluorography as described elsewhere (40Bonner W.M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing either GST or GST-Nef were induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside followed by purification of proteins using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Transfected 293T cells overexpressing Hsp40 were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15% SDS, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Bioscience). The clarified lysates were incubated with either GST or GST-Nef protein immoblized on glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C and subjected to five washes with RIPA buffer. The complexes were resuspended in Laemmli's sample buffer, boiled, and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the membrane was probed with polyclonal Hsp40 antibody. HEK-293T cells overexpressing HA-Nef and Hsp40 and CEM-GFP-infected cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.12 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 45 min. Clarified lysates were incubated with Hsp40 or Nef polyclonal antibody, and the antigen-antibody complex was pulled down by an equal mixture of protein A- and protein G-agarose beads followed by resolution on 12% non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the membrane was probed with either HA antibody or Hsp40 antibody. The blots were developed by using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). Furthermore, equal amounts of protein were taken from the CEM-GFP-infected cell lysates or lysates from 293T cells transfected with viral molecular clones and were run on SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting for Hsp40 and other proteins. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK-293T cells grown on coverslips were transfected with both pCDNA-NefC and pCDNA-Hsp40 by calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection and stained with polyclonal Hsp40 antibody and monoclonal Nef antibody after fixing with 2% paraformaldehyde. The secondary antibodies used for Hsp40 and Nef were indocarbocyanin (Cy3)-conjugated to anti-goat IgG (Chemicon) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated to anti-mouse IgG (Sigma), respectively. After washing, cells were mounted in antifade on the slide, and the samples were analyzed with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Germany). Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was prepared from 2 × 106 HIV-1 NL4-3-infected and uninfected PBMCs using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNA was made using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) followed by amplification by PCR for HSP40 and human β-ACTIN with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using standard conditions and gene-specific oligonucleotide primers as described: human β-ACTIN: forward, 5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′; human HSP40: forward, 5′-CAGGATCCATGGTGGATTACTATGAAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTGGAAGAGAATGAAGTGAGG-3′. Quantification of HSP40 Expression by Real-time PCR—HSP40 expression level was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR of cDNA in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing SYBR Green IQ supermix (BioRad) and 10 pmol concentration of each of the human β-ACTIN and HSP40 primer pairs listed above, using the Icycler IQ real-time thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). The amplification was performed using one cycle of 95 °C for 2 min and 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by melt curve analysis. The changes in the threshold cycle (CT) values were calculated by the equation ΔCT = CT,target - CT,input. The -fold difference was calculated as follows: -fold difference = 2-Δ(ΔCT). Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—107 infected or uninfected CEM-GFP cells were pelleted down and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice for 15 min to allow the cells to swell. After that 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to the cells and vortexed for 10 s. Then samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 s to remove the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear fraction was prepared by resuspending the remaining pellet in 200 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice for 20 min. Equal amounts of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from both infected and uninfected CEM-GFP cells were used for immunoblotting of Hsp40, Nef, RNA pol II, and actin as described above. HSP40 Gene Silencing Using SiRNA—293T cells were transfected with 100 nm control siRNA duplex made against the non-target gene or SMARTpool siRNA duplexes made against HSP40 (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). After 24 h of siRNA transfection pNL4-3 or pNL4-3ΔNef vectors were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After 72 h of siRNA transfection, supernatant was collected, and virus production was determined by p24gag antigen capture ELISA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RNA was also isolated from these 293T cells and expression of HSP40 and p24gag was analyzed by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers. HIV-1 Nef protein interacts with a large number of cellular proteins, most of which perform critical functions in signaling pathways. Although Nef-mediated signaling has been well studied, however, the molecular mechanism of Nef-mediated transcriptional enhancement remains to be clearly elucidated. Furthermore, the majority of studies to date have been performed with Nef protein from subtype B, so we initiated studies with subtype C Nef, which is not only the most prevalent subtype in Africa and Asia but currently accounts for almost 50% of infections worldwide. Although the majority of the functional domains of Nef are well conserved across the subtype, considerable sequence differences are observed. The subtype C Nef from Indian isolate IN301904 used in the present study has about 76% identity at the amino acid level with Nef from the well studied subtype B isolate NL4-3, whereas both proteins show almost 84% similarity in amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). We initiated the present study with screening for subtype C Nef interacting cellular proteins. Identification of a Novel HIV-1 Subtype C Nef-interacting Protein—To identify novel proteins interacting with subtype C Nef, we screened a human leukocyte cDNA library using full-length subtype C Nef as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. Repeated screening on X-gal containing dropout plates led to the identification of a specific positive clone. The gene expressed in this clone was amplified by PCR using the pACT2-specific primers. Sequence analysis and data base comparisons revealed that this clone expressed a gene encoding for a human DnaJ homologue that is HSP40. To further confirm this interaction, liquid β-galactosidase assay was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The yeast clone expressing Hsp40 and subtype C Nef clearly showed β-galactosidase activity in liquid β-galactosidase assay, confirming the protein-protein interaction in the yeast system (Fig. 2A). Subtype C Nef Interacts with Hsp40—Recombinant [35S]methionine-labeled subtype C Nef and Hsp40 protein were prepared from pCDNA-NefC and pCDNA-Hsp40 plasmids, respectively, using in vitro transcription and translations as described earlier. These two proteins were then incubated together and immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-Nef antibody. Fig. 2B clearly showed that subtype C Nef and Hsp40 proteins interacted with each other in vitro as both the proteins were present in lane 2, where Nef antibody was used for immunoprecipitation in contrast to no detectable band in immunoprecipitation performed with control IgG. Whereas the larger Nef (∼27 kDa) is the full-length Nef protein, the smaller Nef (∼25 kDa) corresponds to the Nef protein synthesized as a result of translation initiation from an internal methionine start site (30Joseph A.M. Ladha J.S. Mojamdar M. Mitra D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This result further confirms that Nef and Hsp40 interact with each other in vitro. Hsp40 has been reported to be localized predominantly in the cytoplasm before heat shock and to relocalize in the nucleus after heat shock (18Hattori H. Kaneda T. Lokeshwar B. Laszlo A. Ohtsuka K. J.

Here we show that R1 forms when the Dicer-2/R2D2 heterodimer binds short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. The heterodimer alone can initiate RISC assembly, indicating that other factors are dispensable for initiation. During assembly, R2 requires Argonaute 2 to convert into holo-RISC. This requirement is reminiscent of the RISC-loading complex, which also requires Argonaute 2 for assembly into RISC. We have compared R2 to the RISC-loading complex and show that the two complexes are similar in their sensitivities to ATP and to chemical modifications on siRNA duplexes, indicating that they are likely to be identical. We have examined the requirements for RISC formation and show that the siRNA 5′-termini are repeatedly monitored during RISC assembly, first by the Dcr-2/R2D2 heterodimer and again after R2 formation, before siRNA unwinding. The 2′-position of the 5′-terminal nucleotide also affects RISC assembly, because an siRNA strand bearing a 2′-deoxyribose at this position can inhibit the cognate strand from entering holo-RISC; in contrast, the 2′-deoxyribose-modified strand has enhanced activity in the RNA interference pathway.

In many eukaryotic organisms, double-stranded RNAs elicit an innate gene-silencing phenomenon known as RNAi 2The abbreviations used are:RNAiRNA interferenceRDIR2D2-Dcr2 initiatorAgo2Argonaute 2DcrDicerdTdeoxythymidinePp-lucPhotinus pyralis luciferaseRISCRNA-induced silencing complexRLCRISC-loading complexrUribouridinesiRNAshort interfering RNA (1Fire A.

In the first phase, the double-stranded RNAs are cleaved by the RNase III enzyme Dicer into double-stranded fragments called siRNAs (2Zamore P.D. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P.

Exactly how the double-stranded RNAs make the transition from the targets of the first phase to the triggers of the second phase is the subject of recent and continuing investigation. RNA interference R2D2-Dcr2 initiator Argonaute 2 Dicer deoxythymidine Photinus pyralis luciferase RNA-induced silencing complex RISC-loading complex ribouridine short interfering RNA The siRNAs produced by Dicer may determine the outcome of this transition. Newly generated siRNAs have characteristic 5′-phosphorylated ends that are recognized by the RNAi machinery (8Nykänen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and facilitate their entry into the RISC (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J.

Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). To get there, the siRNA duplexes have to be separated into their constituent strands (8Nykänen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), and only one of the two strands is assembled into the RISC (10Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Urlaub H. Luhrmann R. Tuschl T. Cell. 2002; 110: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). When synthetic siRNAs are used to initiate RNAi, the siRNA strand whose 5′-end is less stably base-paired is more frequently incorporated into the RISC (17Khvorova A. Reynolds A. Jayasena S.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar, 18Schwarz D.S. Hutvagner G. Du T. Xu Z. Aronin N. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar), whereas the cognate strand is more frequently degraded. We showed previously that siRNAs are channeled into the RISC in an ordered pathway that links the early and late phases of RNAi (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The pathway begins when a group of pre-associated factors binds the siRNA to form an initiation complex known as R1. R1 is an ATP-independent complex that cannot form on siRNAs that lack 5′-phosphorylated ends. It contains at least two protein factors: Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), the Drosophila enzyme responsible for generating siRNAs, and presumably R2D2, a Dcr-2-associated factor that is a key player in bridging the initiation and effector phases of RNAi (19Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.-E. Smith D.P. Wang X. Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The R1 complex is converted into the intermediate complex R2 by the ATP-independent addition of unidentified factors. Eventually the siRNA in R2 is unwound, leading to the formation of a large, ATP-dependent, ∼80 S complex known as holo-RISC (formerly R3). This complex can cleave targeted mRNAs, likely acting as the RNAi effector in Drosophila (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Zamore and co-workers (15Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R. Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) have proposed a similar yet distinct assembly pathway that begins when siRNAs first bind to a complex known as B. Complex B contains neither Dcr-2 nor R2D2 but is proposed to be a direct precursor to the RISC-loading complex (RLC; formerly complex A), which harbors both of these factors and reportedly requires ATP to form (15Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R. Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Dcr-2 and R2D2 cross-link to opposite ends of the siRNA duplex in the RLC, and the orientation of this interaction is strongly influenced by the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the two siRNA ends (16Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). R2D2 prefers to bind the more stably base-paired end, whereas Dcr-2 typically binds to the less stably base-paired of the two ends. Because the siRNA strand that enters RISC is the one whose 5′-end is less stably base-paired, R2D2 is thought to sense siRNA asymmetry, distinguishing the strand that enters the RISC from the one destined for degradation (16Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Although there are parallels between the two proposed RISC assembly models, there are also key differences. For example, it is unclear how complex B and the RLC fit into the R1 → R2 → holo-RISC assembly scheme. We aim to resolve the discrepancies in the two models and develop a coherent, unified understanding of RISC assembly in Drosophila. To that end, we have defined in greater detail the molecular events of the assembly pathway, providing a model that includes multiple 5′-recognition events and reconciles the reported differences in the R2 and RLC complexes. Synthetic siRNAs—Single-stranded siRNAs were obtained either from IDT or Dharmacon. The siRNAs were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (MP Biomedicals) and T4 Polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The single-stranded siRNAs were annealed as described previously (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J.

Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3191-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) (15%) or recombinant R2D2/Dcr-2 heterodimer (107 nm) and 32P-radiolabeled Photinus pyralis luciferase (Pp-luc) siRNA were incubated at 25 °C for 40 min. The purified, baculovirus-expressed recombinant R2D2/Dcr-2 heterodimer was generously provided by Y. Tomari and P. Zamore. The mixtures were loaded onto a Superdex-200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and fractionated as described previously (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). 200-μl fractions were collected and analyzed by Cerenkov counting. To partially purify R2D2/Dcr-2 fractions, 200 μl of embryo extract was loaded directly onto a Superdex 200 column and chromatographed as described above. The R1-forming fractions were collected (fractions 18-28), supplemented with carrier insulin (final concentration 0.25 mg/ml) (Sigma), and concentrated to ∼180 μl in a Microcon YM-30 spin column (Millipore). Native Gel Electrophoresis—RNAi reaction mixtures for native gel experiments were assembled as described previously (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), except that reaction volumes were 5 μl rather than 10 μl and the mixtures contained 15% embryo lysate. The mixtures were quenched with 1 μl of a 4 mg/ml heparin mix and analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide native gels (10.8 mm × 17 cm × 23 cm) that were run at 10 watts at 4 °C in 1× Tris borate-EDTA as described previously (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Agarose native gels were prepared and run as reported previously (15Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R. Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) with modifications (21Okamura K. Ishizuka A. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1655-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). ATP depletion was performed by pre-incubating reaction mixtures with glucose (20 mm) and hexokinase (Calbiochem, 0.5 units) for 20 min at 25 °C. The concentration of ATP after depletion was measured using an ATP bioluminescence assay kit (Sigma) and was confirmed in all ATP-depleted samples to be <100 nm. RNA Unwinding—Standard unwinding assays were performed as described previously (8Nykänen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The zero time point samples were treated with proteinase K and stop buffer just prior to the addition of radiolabeled siRNA. The amount of double-stranded and single-stranded siRNA detected at time 0 was set to 100 and 0%, respectively. Dcr-2 and R2D2 Comprise R1 and Can Initiate RISC Assembly— RISC assembly in Drosophila proceeds in a stepwise manner and is first detected when proteins bind siRNA within the R1 complex (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To examine whether R1 contains any factors other than R2D2 and Dcr-2, we incubated radiolabeled siRNA with purified recombinant R2D2/Dcr-2 heterodimer and compared it to the R1 complex formed in embryo lysates. When analyzed by gel filtration (Fig. 1a) and native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1b), the recombinant R2D2/Dcr-2/siRNA complex was indistinguishable from R1. These results indicate that R1 is not likely to contain any additional factors, so we now refer to it as the R2D2/Dcr-2 initiator (RDI) complex to distinguish it from the unbound Dcr-2/R2D2 heterodimer. If R2D2 and Dcr-2 are the only protein components of the RDI, then the recombinant R2D2/Dcr-2 heterodimer should suffice for initiating RISC assembly. To test this hypothesis, we performed a pulse-chase experiment with pre-formed RDI prepared from recombinant R2D2/Dcr-2 (Fig. 1c). Radiolabeled siRNAs were incubated with recombinant R2D2/Dcr-2 and allowed to form the RDI complex. An excess of unlabeled siRNA competitor was then added, and the mixture was “chased” with wild-type embryo extract. The radiolabeled siRNA in the RDI complex was rapidly conveyed into R2 and later into holo-RISC, indicating that recombinant R2D2/Dcr-2 alone can initiate RISC assembly (Fig. 1c, lanes 2-7). Argonaute 2 (Ago2) Affects RISC Assembly at the R2 to Holo-RISC Transition—Ago2 is a core RISC constituent (5Hammond S.M. Boettcher S. Caudy A.A. Kobayashi R. Hannon G.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) that acts at several stages in the RNAi pathway, both early and late, to promote siRNA unwinding (21Okamura K. Ishizuka A. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1655-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and, ultimately, to cleave targeted mRNAs as the “slicer” endonuclease (22Song J.J. Smith S.K. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Science. 2004; 305: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 23Parker J.S. Roe S.M. Barford D.

Science. 2004; 305: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). Holo-RISC formation requires Ago2 because the assembly pathway stalls at the RLC in ago2 null lysate (21Okamura K. Ishizuka A. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1655-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). To determine whether the RDI or R2 complexes are functionally similar to the RLC, we used the native polyacrylamide gel system to examine the complexes that form on radiolabeled siRNA incubated in an ago2 null lysate (ago2414) (21Okamura K. Ishizuka A. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1655-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In this lysate, RISC assembly arrested at R2 (Fig. 2, lane 1) but proceeded to holo-RISC both in wild-type lysates and in those prepared from ago2 null embryos transformed with an AGO2 transgene (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that R2 may be similar to the RLC (see below). Furthermore, because Ago2 is required for siRNA unwinding (21Okamura K. Ishizuka A. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1655-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), these data indicate that R2 contains double-stranded siRNA, an indication that is consistent with our previous observation that R2 does not require ATP to form (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The 5′-Ends of siRNA Duplexes Are Monitored at Multiple Stages of RISC Assembly—siRNAs that lack 5′-phosphate groups on both strands are unable to enter the RISC assembly pathway (8Nykänen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J.

Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), obscuring the potential 5′-recognition events that may occur at later stages of assembly and catalysis. To address these possible recognition events, we examined the native gel complexes that formed on siRNA lacking a 5′-phosphate on one of the two strands. The radiolabeled 5′-phosphorylated strand was annealed to an unlabeled cognate strand bearing either a 5′-hydroxyl or 5′-phosphate terminus (Fig. 3a). When incubated in embryo lysate, the singly phosphorylated siRNA showed reduced levels of holo-RISC compared with the doubly phosphorylated control (Fig. 3b, lanes 1 and 2), even though there is a kinase in the lysate that phosphorylates most of the siRNA (8Nykänen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that a fraction of the siRNA rapidly enters the RISC assembly pathway, escaping the kinase activity. These siRNAs appear to be shielded (at least partially) from the kinase but are defective at some stage of RISC assembly, presumably because they remain singly phosphorylated. Similar effects were observed with three other siRNA sequences (supplemental Fig. 1, available in the on-line version of this article). As an initial test to identify the source of the defect, we incubated the singly and doubly phosphorylated siRNAs in ago2 null lysate and found that they formed comparable levels of the RDI and R2 complexes (Fig. 3b, lanes 3 and 4). Because singly phosphorylated siRNA can assemble into these early complexes, but not into holo-RISC, these data indicate that a second 5′-recognition event occurs after formation of both the RDI and R2 complexes. We performed a more rigorous analysis to test our initial observations, examining the formation of each complex in the assembly pathway. To assess how singly phosphorylated siRNAs fare in RDI formation, we incubated siRNA with partially purified R2D2/Dcr-2 fractions depleted of ATP. These fractions are capable of forming the RDI but cannot form R2. Furthermore, ATP depletion prevents phosphorylation of the siRNA 5′-end. Under these conditions, the singly and doubly phosphorylated siRNAs formed comparable levels of RDI (Fig. 3c), indicating that singly phosphorylated siRNAs can initiate RISC assembly. Similar results were obtained when the siRNAs were incubated with recombinant R2D2/Dcr-2 instead of partially purified R2D2/Dcr-2 fractions (data not shown). To see how well singly phosphorylated siRNAs assemble into R2, we incubated siRNA with ago2 null lysate depleted of ATP. When incubated in this lysate, the singly and doubly phosphorylated siRNAs formed similar levels of R2 (Fig. 3d), consistent with our initial observations (Fig. 3b). We next examined the requirement for 5′-phosphates in holo-RISC formation. To do this, we prepared Pp-luc siRNA bearing a 5′-methoxy modification on the non-radiolabeled strand. This was necessary because, unlike both the RDI and R2 complexes, holo-RISC requires ATP to form (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J.

Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Therefore, we could not use 5′-hydroxyl siRNAs in extracts depleted of ATP for our analysis. The 5′-methoxy-modified RNA is commercially available only for 2′-deoxythymidine nucleotides (dT-OCH3). To control for the 2′-deoxyribose modification, we prepared an analogous siRNA bearing a 5′-phosphate group (dT-PO4). We also prepared an siRNA bearing a terminal 5′-phosphorylated ribouridine (rU-PO4) as an unmodified control. When incubated in embryo lysate and analyzed by native gel electrophoresis, the rU-PO4 siRNA formed holo-RISC as expected (Fig. 3e, lane 1). However, the 5′-phosphorylated, 2′-deoxythymidine control siRNA (dT-PO4) formed unexpectedly low levels of holo-RISC relative to the rU-PO4 siRNA control (Fig. 3e, lane 2). This defect was also observed with an siRNA containing a 5′-terminal 2′-deoxyuridine nucleotide (dU-PO4), indicating that the 2′-deoxyribose, not the thymine base, was responsible for the defect (data not shown). The singly phosphorylated dT-OCH3 siRNA formed little (if any) holo-RISC (Fig. 3e, lane 3), confirming our earlier observations (Fig. 3b). Similar patterns of holo-RISC formation were observed using different siRNA sequences (supplemental Fig. 2, available in the on-line version of this article) at levels that were consistent with the prevailing asymmetry rules (17Khvorova A. Reynolds A. Jayasena S.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar, 18Schwarz D.S. Hutvagner G. Du T. Xu Z. Aronin N. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed elevated levels of both the RDI and R2 complexes with the singly phosphorylated dT-OCH3 siRNA (Fig. 3e, lane 3). Because these early complexes contain duplex siRNA, the singly phosphorylated siRNAs may be inhibited from unwinding. The siRNA 5′ Termini Regulate siRNA Unwinding—To test this hypothesis, we assayed the unwinding of Pp-luc siRNAs that were chemically modified on the non-radiolabeled strand. When we examined the rate and extent of single-stranded siRNA production, significant levels of unwound siRNA accumulated for the rU-PO4Pp-luc siRNA but not for the analogous Pp-luc siRNAs that were modified on the non-radiolabeled strand (Fig. 3f), consistent with the levels of holo-RISC formed on these siRNAs (Fig. 3e). When we quantitated the data as the fraction of double-stranded siRNA that persisted with time, approximately half of the rU-PO4Pp-luc siRNA remained after 2 h (Fig. 3g). The discrepancy between the amount of single-stranded siRNA produced (∼10%; Fig. 3f) and the amount of double-stranded siRNA lost over time (∼45%; Fig. 3g) is likely due to degradation of the radiolabeled strand, which in this case is thermodynamically disfavored for entry into the RISC and, relative to the unlabeled strand, more frequently destroyed. In contrast, the level of duplex dT-OCH3 siRNA remained relatively unchanged (Fig. 3g). Strikingly, the level of duplex dT-PO4 siRNA dropped precipitously after just 30 min (Fig. 3g), even though we observed no accumulation of single-stranded RNA (Fig. 3f). Similar patterns of unwinding were observed for a different siRNA duplex (supplemental Fig. 3, available in the on-line version of this article). Together, these data indicate that siRNAs must be doubly phosphorylated to efficiently unwind. Furthermore, an siRNA strand bearing a 5′-terminal 2′-deoxyribose modification somehow inhibits the cognate strand from entering the RISC. We wondered if the deoxyribose-modified strand itself could enter the RISC. To address this question, we radiolabeled the 2′-deoxyribose-modified Pp-luc siRNA strand, annealed it to the unlabeled, unmodified, cognate RNA, and tracked its progress through the RISC assembly pathway. The modified strand (dT) assembled into holo-RISC at higher levels than the unmodified control (rU) (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). One possible explanation for our observations is that the 5′-terminal 2′-deoxyribose modification destabilizes the RNA helix at the modified end. This would shift the siRNA asymmetry, resulting in enhanced selection of the modified strand and reduced selection of the unmodified strand, as we observed. We consider this scenario unlikely, because thermal melting analysis revealed no significant differences in the melting temperatures and free energies of the rU-PO4 and dT-PO4 siRNAs (supplemental Fig. 4, available in the on-line version of the article). This result indicates that the terminal 2′-deoxyribose modification does not significantly destabilize the RNA duplex. To directly address how the modification affects RISC activity, we examined the cleavage of both sense and antisense Pp-luc target mRNAs guided by the Pp-luc siRNA (Fig. 5a). The control rU-PO4 siRNA was able to guide cleavage of both the sense and antisense Pp-luc mRNAs, as expected (Fig. 5, b and c, lanes 4). In contrast, the singly phosphorylated dT-OCH3 siRNA was unable to guide significant cleavage of either the sense or the antisense Pp-luc mRNAs (Fig. 3, b and c, lanes 6), consistent with its inability to unwind (Fig. 3, f and g). When we assayed cleavage guided by the siRNA bearing a single 2′-deoxyribose modification on the antisense strand (dT-PO4), we observed distinct activity with respect to the two target mRNAs. The unmodified sense siRNA strand did not promote significant RISC-mediated cleavage (Fig. 5b, lane 5). In contrast, the 2′-deoxyribose-modified antisense strand generated robust cleavage of the sense mRNA (Fig. 5c, lane 5). When we performed the experiment as a time course, the dT-PO4-modified siRNA clearly cleaved more sense mRNA than the rU-PO4 control (Fig. 5d). These results confirm that a 5′-terminal 2′-deoxyribose modification enhances the RNAi activity of the modified strand while simultaneously suppressing the activity of the cognate strand. Interestingly, mRNA cleavage guided by single-stranded siRNA was also enhanced by a 5′-terminal 2′-deoxyribose modification (supplemental Fig. 5, available in the on-line version of this article). R2 Is Similar to the RLC—We have shown that the R2 complex does not require ATP to form (14Pham J.W. Pellino J.L. Lee Y.S. Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Cell. 2004; 117: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and, further, that it can assemble on singly phosphorylated siRNA (Fig. 3e). It is therefore unlike the RLC, which reportedly depends on ATP as well as both 5′-phosphates (15Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R. Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Although the two complexes differ in these regards, they share common features. They both directly precede holo-RISC in the assembly pathway, and they both accumulate in the absence of Ago2 (Fig. 2) (16Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 21Okamura K. Ishizuka A. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1655-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). To see if these complexes are truly distinct, we compared them directly. 5′-Radiolabeled Pp-luc siRNA was incubated in embryo lysates that were either depleted of ATP or supplemented with ATP. These reaction mixtures were split and loaded onto either a polyacrylamide or an agarose native gel to detect R2 and the RLC, respectively. Surprisingly, in our hands the RLC formed in extracts depleted of ATP, albeit at lower levels than the ATP-supplemented control (Fig. 6a, lanes 3 and 4). ATP depletion was successful because the ATP-dependent RISC complex did not form in either gel system after depletion (Fig. 6a, lanes 1 and 3). Furthermore, the residual ATP concentration after depletion was <100 nm (data not shown), a level reported previously to block RLC formation (15Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R. Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To test the 5′-phosphate requirements for RLC formation, we examined the complexes that formed on singly phosphorylated Pp-luc siRNA that were modified on one strand with a 5′-methoxy group. Unexpectedly, the singly phosphorylated siRNA assembled into the RLC but did not proceed to the RISC in the agarose native gel (Fig. 6b, lane 3). We observed similar results using the 3′-cordycepin-labeled duplexes employed previously (15Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R. Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) (data not shown). There was some signal in the agarose gel that co-migrated with RISC when we used the dT-PO4 siRNA (Fig. 6b, lane 2). Because the radiolabeled, unmodified strand of this siRNA can neither assemble into RISC (Fig. 3e, lane 2) nor cleave targeted mRNAs (Fig. 5b, lane 5), some of the signal in this region of the gel is not RISC or represents a nonfunctional form of RISC. Based on these results, we conclude that R2 and the RLC are similar, probably identical, complexes. To act as silencing triggers, double-stranded siRNAs must be channeled through an ordered RISC assembly pathway that results in the selection of one strand and the destruction of the other. Our results indicate that siRNA ends are recognized at multiple steps in the pathway and that these recognition events determine whether the siRNAs will become incorporated into the RISC or blocked from further assembly. The first recognition event occurs at initiation, when Dcr-2 and R2D2 bind the siRNA to form the RDI complex. RDI formation requires 5′-phosphorylated siRNA; however, the siRNA need not be phosphorylated on both strands. Nykänen et al. (8Nykänen A. Haley B. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2001; 107: 309-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) showed previously that siRNAs bearing a single 5′-phosphate group are ineffective at guiding mRNA cleavage. This was true for siRNAs phosphorylated only on the guiding strand as well as those phosphorylated only on the non-guiding strand. To explain these observations, Tomari et al. (16Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) invoke a model in which R2D2 acts as a sensor for siRNA asymmetry. They suggest that a 5′-phosphate on the thermodynamically disfavored “passenger” strand is required for stable R2D2 binding, facilitating siRNA incorporation into the RLC and the RISC. Because the non-guiding strand of the siRNA used by Nykänen et al. lacked this phosphate, they suggest that it was excluded from the RISC at the level of R2D2 binding. Consequently, they propose that R2D2 is a licensing factor, allowing only authentic siRNAs to enter the RNAi pathway (16Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). If the basic features of their model are correct, then our data indicate that R2D2 does not act alone in distinguishing authentic from inauthentic (non-phosphorylated) siRNA. When only one of the two siRNA strands is phosphorylated, R2D2 and Dcr-2 can still avidly engage the siRNA, probably with R2D2 located at the phosphorylated end as predicted (16Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Despite this observation, singly phosphorylated siRNA duplexes are still ineffective silencing triggers. Our data indicate that a second 5′-recognition event occurs after R2D2 binding. RNA unwinding and activation can proceed, but only if the siRNA bears the second 5′-phosphate at the end not occupied by R2D2. Because Ago2 is required both for siRNA unwinding and target mRNA cleavage, it may be the factor that recognizes the second 5′-phosphate. Two groups have recently shown that an archaebacterial PIWI protein has conserved residues that interact with the 5′-phosphate group of siRNA-like duplexes (26Ma J.B. Yuan Y.R. Meister G. Pei Y. Tuschl T. Patel D.J. Nature. 2005; 434: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 27Parker J.S. Roe S.M. Barford D. Nature. 2005; 434: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when analogous residues were mutated in the human Ago2 PIWI domain, target mRNA cleavage was compromised (26Ma J.B. Yuan Y.R. Meister G. Pei Y. Tuschl T. Patel D.J. Nature. 2005; 434: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In light of our own observations, these results seem to implicate Ago2 in the second 5′-recognition event. Alternatively, Ago2 may not engage the 5′-phosphate until later in the assembly pathway. In this case, some other factor may interact with the second 5′-phosphate upstream of Ago2, causing the RISC assembly defect that we observed with singly phosphorylated siRNA duplexes. Like the 5′-phosphate group, the 2′-hydroxyl of the 5′-terminal nucleotide can influence RISC assembly. A 5′-terminal 2′-deoxyribose modification on one siRNA strand inhibits the cognate strand from entering the RISC. Because the unmodified cognate strand does not accumulate in an unwinding assay, it is probably degraded. In contrast, the modified strand has enhanced activity and is apparently favored for entry into the RISC. There are at least two (non-mutually exclusive) explanations for these observations. The 2′-deoxyribose may be a negative determinant for R2D2 binding. In support of this possibility, the dT-PO4-modified Pp-luc-switch siRNA forms very little of the RDI and R2 complexes (supplemental Fig. 2, lane 2), even though it has a relatively stable and phosphorylated terminus that R2D2 would be expected to bind. Decreased R2D2 binding would bias the “sensor” of siRNA asymmetry (16Tomari Y. Matranga C. Haley B. Martinez N. Zamore P.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), leading to increased selection of the modified strand and increased degradation of the unmodified strand, as we observed. Alternatively, the 2′-deoxyribose-modified strand may have an increased affinity for some downstream RNAi factor, thereby enhancing its entry into the RISC. This may also explain why a single-stranded dT-PO4-modified siRNA is better at guiding target mRNA cleavage than the analogous rU-PO4 control (supplemental Fig. 5). In either case, our observations are surprising because the RNAi apparatus generally tolerates limited modifications at the 2′-position of siRNA duplexes, both on the sense and antisense strands (28Parrish S. Fleenor J. Xu S. Mello C. Fire A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1077-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 29Chiu Y.L. Rana T.M.

However, completely substituting siRNAs with 2′-deoxy modifications on either the sense or antisense strand abolishes their ability to guide target mRNA cleavage (31Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar), perhaps by altering the helical geometry of the duplex. Because there does not seem to be a general requirement for 2′-hydroxyls along the length of the siRNA non-guiding strand, the defect we observe for 5′-terminal 2′-deoxyribose modifications could reflect a specific recognition event that we cannot yet fully define. Because a 5′-terminal 2′-deoxyribose modification on one siRNA strand can inhibit the activity of the cognate strand, it should reduce the off-target effects that can complicate RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Thus, this simple and inexpensive modification should be considered in the design of effective siRNA reagents for targeted gene knock-down. Finally, we have made progress in our goal of developing a more unified understanding of RISC assembly in Drosophila (Fig. 6c). We have shown that the R2D2/Dcr-2 heterodimer alone can initiate RISC assembly by binding siRNAs to form the RDI complex. Like the RDI, complex B has been proposed to act at initiation (15Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R. Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Because this complex can form in the absence of R2D2 (15Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R. Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), it is upstream of the RDI and may play an auxiliary role in RISC assembly. Complex B may transfer bound siRNA directly to the RDI in addition to (or instead of) the RLC. Continuing investigation will be required to resolve this issue. Our results suggest that the RLC and R2 complexes have more in common than previously thought. Based on our side-by-side comparisons, both complexes can form in extracts that lack Ago2 and in extracts depleted of ATP. Furthermore, both complexes can assemble on siRNAs that lack a phosphate on one of the two siRNA strands. The ATP and 5′-phosphate requirements that we observed for the RLC are distinct from those reported previously (15Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R. Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We do not know the reason for these discrepancies. Based on our observations, R2 and the RLC are probably identical complexes, and we now refer to R2 as the RLC. We thank Y. Tomari and P.

The first step was rapid and resulted in formation of an inactive monomer with a completely folded C-terminal domain, whereas the N-terminal domain was in the molten globule state. The second step was promoted by Ca2+ and converted LPL monomers from the molten globule state to dimerization-competent and more tightly folded monomers that rapidly formed active LPL dimers.

Recently, we showed that folding into the active form is dependent on endoplasmic reticulum-derived molecular chaperones (7Zhang L. Wu G. Tate C.G. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. J. Biol.

It has been suggested that the instability of the LPL dimer might be a built-in mechanism to limit the life span of LPL at the endothelium, where the enzyme is out of reach of normal control systems such as protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation and other intracellular regulatory systems (9Olivecrona T.

The dominating form in circulating blood is the inactive monomer, probably because this form has lower affinity for heparan sulfate proteoglycans and therefore detaches from the endothelial binding sites and appears in blood (12Olivecrona G.

The activity of LPL in the major metabolic tissues (muscle and adipose tissue) is regulated according to the nutritional status (14Doolittle M.H. Ben-Zeev O. Elovson J. Martin D. Kirchgessner T.G. J.

The conversion of active dimers to inactive monomers was until now considered to be an irreversible process (8Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T.

Based on the observation that the fractional rate for inactivation of LPL increases with decreasing concentrations of the lipase protein, it was concluded that reversible interactions occur between active monomeric and dimeric species of LPL and that dissociation into active monomers precedes the irreversible loss of activity, which occurs by unfolding of the monomers (8Osborne Jr., J.C.

Inactivation is accompanied by only a moderate change in secondary structure, indicating that the inactive monomer retains a folded shape (8Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The decay to inactive monomers must be rapid because it has not been possible to isolate catalytically active monomers of LPL. Previous studies have shown that monomers of LPL can associate into higher oligomers (aggregates) both in vivo and in vitro (6Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For many proteins, removal of the denaturant leads to aggregation rather than correct refolding (19Rozema D. Gellman S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15760-15771Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In recent years, an understanding of protein folding and refolding has developed, and strategies for overcoming aggregation have been explored. In many cases, refolding can be achieved by manipulation with additives, including detergents (20Tandon S. Horowitz P. J. Biol.

The possibility that fully or partially denatured LPL refolds into the active dimeric form has not previously been systematically explored. We observed that LPL could regain traces of activity when incubated for long times (hours or days) under assay conditions with substrate, heparin, and serum as source of the activator apolipoprotein CII or in cell culture medium containing serum. 4G. Olivecrona, unpublished data. In this investigation, we studied the refolding pathway of LPL after full denaturation in 6 m guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), after dissociation into inactive monomers in 1 m GdmCl, or by other means (temperature). We identified serum as the factor promoting reactivation in crude systems. Further investigations demonstrated that calcium was the crucial component in serum necessary for the successful refolding of LPL from the molten globule, monomeric state to the more tightly folded, active, dimeric form. The rate-limiting step for complete refolding appears to be formation of a dimerization-competent monomer. Our results demonstrate that proline isomerization is a likely determinant of the slow kinetics for the calcium-induced reactivation of LPL. Materials—GdmCl, CaCl2, trypsin, bovine cyclophilin A, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Sigma. Heparin was from Leo Pharma AB (Malmö, Sweden). Heparin-Sepharose was prepared as described previously (29Iverius P.-H. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and LPL was purified from bovine milk (30Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The concentrations of LPL were determined from absorbance at 280 nm (A280 nm = 1 corresponds to 0.60 mg/ml) or by the immunoassay described below. 4,4′-Dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (dipotassium salt; bis-ANS) was from Molecular Probes. The concentration of bis-ANS was determined from the absorbance at 394 nm using A394 nm = 16,000 cm–1 m–1 (31Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Human and rat sera were collected after clotting of the blood. For some experiments, rat serum was heated for 30 min at 56 °C, followed by overnight incubation at 10 °C with 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dialysis against 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 2 mm EDTA. Lipoprotein-depleted serum and isolated lipoprotein fractions were prepared by sequential ultracentrifugation after additions of KBr to increase the density of the medium (32Lookene A. Savonen R. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5267-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The lipoprotein fractions were then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 2 mm EDTA. LPL Denaturation and Refolding—For gentle dissociation into folded but inactive monomers, native bovine LPL (0.8 mg/ml in 20 mm Bistris (pH 6.5) containing 1.2 m NaCl) was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 2 m NaCl and 1 m GdmCl (8Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For full denaturation, native LPL (0.8 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 6 m GdmCl or 8 m urea for 2 h. In other experiments, native LPL was mixed with 8 m GdmCl to a final concentration of 6 m GdmCl and incubated for the time specified in the figure legends. Refolding of fully denatured LPL was performed by dilution (50–100 fold) in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 2.0 m NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2 or 20% (v/v) serum, followed by incubation at 25 °C for 5 h or for the times specified in the figure legends. For fluorescence measurements during refolding experiments, 10% glycerol was added to the buffer to stabilize LPL. LPL Activity and Mass—LPL activity and protein mass were assayed as described previously (11Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For activity measurements, 5 μl was incubated in a total volume of 200 μl of a mixture containing a phospholipid-stabilized emulsion of soybean triacylglycerols, with the same composition as Intralipid (10%; Fresenius Kabi AG), into which tri-[9,10-3H]oleoylglycerol had been incorporated by the manufacturer. Heat-inactivated rat serum was present as a source of apolipoprotein CII (10 μl), BSA as a fatty acid acceptor (12 mg), and heparin to stabilize the lipase (10 IU/ml). One milliunit of lipase activity corresponds to release of 1 nmol of fatty acid/min at 25 °C and pH 8.5 All samples were measured in triplicates, and the incubation time was adapted to give results in the linear range of the assay. For measurement of LPL mass, affinity-purified chicken immunoglobulins (IgY) raised against bovine LPL was used for capture of the antigen on microtiter plates during overnight incubation. Bound LPL was detected with monoclonal antibody 5D2, raised against bovine LPL (a kind gift from Dr. John Brunzell, University of Washington, Seattle, WA), followed by peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG. LPL purified from bovine milk was used as a standard. All samples were analyzed in three different dilutions. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were performed using a SPEX FluoroMax-2 fluorometer. The experiments were done at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 2 m NaCl with or without 2.5 mm CaCl2. For experiments involving refolding, the samples also contained 10% (v/v) glycerol to stabilize LPL. Stock solutions of bis-ANS (50 μm) were prepared in methanol. bis-ANS was added in equimolar concentrations compared with the concentration of monomeric LPL immediately prior to the measurements. Fluorescence emission spectra for tryptophan residues were recorded at 300–400 nm with excitation at 295 nm. For bis-ANS, the emission spectra were recorded at 420–550 nm with excitation at 390 nm. CD Measurements—CD measurements were carried out at 25 °C using a Jasco J-700 spectropolarimeter in the far-UV region (200–250 nm) and a cuvette with 1-mm path length. LPL was diluted in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) with or without 2.5 mm CaCl2 to a concentration of 75 μg/ml. To reach an acceptable ratio of signal to noise, the buffer contained a reduced concentration of NaCl (0.3 m instead of 2 m) compared with that used in the other experiments. For all spectra, a reference sample containing the corresponding buffer was subtracted from the CD signal. The mean residue ellipticities were calculated according to the following equation: (θ)λ = 115(θ)obs/10LC, where 115 is the mean amino acid residue molecular weight of bovine LPL (33Senda M. Oka K. Brown W.V. Qasba P.K. Furuichi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4369-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), L is the path length in centimeters, and C is the concentration of LPL in grams/ml (8Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Chromatography on Heparin-Sepharose—Separation was carried out as described previously (11Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 ml of refolded LPL (10 μg/ml) was diluted 10-fold in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol before loading onto the column (1 ml of sedimented gel). After washing, the column was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl in the same buffer (from 0.15 to 2.0 m), and 1-ml fractions were collected. The salt concentrations in the fractions were determined manually by conductometry using standard solutions of NaCl made up in the same buffer. Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—For determination of the aggregation state of LPL, triplicate samples of refolded LPL (10 μg/ml in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 2 m NaCl in a total volume of 200 μl) were applied to linear sucrose density gradients (5–20% (w/v)) made up in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 2.0 m NaCl and 1 mg/ml BSA (total gradient volume of 3.6 ml). Centrifugation was carried out in a Beckman Coulter SW 60 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 16 h at 10 °C. After centrifugation, 238-μl fractions were collected by puncturing the bottom of the centrifuge tube using a needle attached by tubing to a pump. As a reference sample, dissociated monomeric LPL was prepared by treatment of native LPL with 1 m GdmCl in 20 mm Tris-Cl containing 0.5 m ammonium sulfate and 0.2 m NaCl (8Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This sample was diluted to a concentration of 2 μg/200 μl of the same buffer as used for the sucrose density gradients, and then 2 μg of native bovine LPL was added to produce a reference with both monomeric and dimeric forms of LPL. This sample (run in triplicate) was run in separate tubes from the samples of refolded LPL. Measurements of LPL activity and mass were made on the fractions as described above. Preparation of a Heat-inactivated LPL Monomer, Followed by Refolding—Gentle thermal inactivation of LPL was accomplished by incubation at 25 °C until no measurable lipase activity was left (overnight). The sample (10 μg/ml LPL in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol and 2 m NaCl) was then divided into two groups, which were incubated with or without 2.5 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C for 5 h. Preparation of Inactive Placental LPL, Followed by Refolding—Human placenta (9 g) was homogenized in 81 ml of ice-cold 0.025 m ammonia buffer (pH 8.2) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 2 Complete Mini proteinase inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) per 100 ml. After centrifugation, 75 ml of the supernatant was used for chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (5 ml of gel) essentially as described above, but the gradient was run from 0.15 to 1.6 m NaCl (total volume of 100 ml), and all buffers contained 1 mg/ml BSA. LPL activity and mass were assayed in each fraction as described above. The peak fraction from the inactive monomer (200 ng/ml in buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl) was used for refolding at 25 °C for 5 h. The concentration of NaCl was first adjusted to 2.0 m by addition of solid NaCl, and the sample was divided into two groups, which were incubated with or without 2.5 mm CaCl2. Trypsin Digestion—Refolded, previously fully denatured LPL (50 μg) in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 2 m NaCl with a residual concentration of GdmCl amounting to 0.06 m was digested with 5 μg of trypsin (10% (w/w) LPL protein) at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a 10-fold molar excess over trypsin. The samples were then briefly dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) and 2 m NaCl to remove the remaining GdmCl. After addition of SDS to the samples to 0.05% (w/v), the dialysis buffer was changed to 0.05% SDS in water. After lyophilization, the samples were dissolved in sample buffer and heated to 95 °C before analyses by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide). Double Jump Experiment—To study whether the refolding kinetics of fully denatured LPL depend on denaturation time, LPL (0.8 mg/ml in 10 mm Bistris (pH 6.5) and 1 m NaCl) was denatured by addition of 8 m GdmCl to a final concentration of 6 m at 4 °C. After 1 min, 0.5 h, and 2 h, the denaturation was stopped by dilution of a sample in a solution of 20 mm Tris, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and 2.0 m NaCl. Recovery of LPL activity was then followed for 6 h at 25 °C. Effect on Refolding by a Peptidylprolyl Isomerase (Bovine Cyclophilin A)—Because cyclophilin A is sensitive to GdmCl, in these experiments, denaturation of LPL was carried out for 2 h at 4 °C in 8 m urea at pH 8.0 instead of in 6 m GdmCl. After this treatment, LPL was completely unfolded as evidenced by CD measurements. Refolding was initiated by dilution in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 2 m NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml VLDL, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 in the presence or absence of 1 μm bovine cyclophilin A (34Kamen D.E. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4713-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). VLDL was included in these experiments to stabilize active LPL. Fully Denatured LPL Can Refold into an Active State in the Presence of Serum—A previous study has shown that the catalytic activity of LPL can be stabilized by the presence of heparin, lipid substrates, and serum (30Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of a combination of all these additives or human serum alone on the recovery of LPL activity after overnight incubation at 10 °C. For this, LPL fully denatured by treatment with 6 m GdmCl was diluted 50-fold in buffer with or without additives. We found that a few percent of the original LPL activity was recovered in buffer containing serum. The recovery was higher (∼8%) when the buffer contained heparin in addition to serum (Fig. 1A). No activity was recovered in buffer with heparin and/or lipid substrate but no serum, indicating that serum was the most crucial component of the incubation medium. The presence of heparin increased the recovery of LPL activity when present together with serum (with or without substrate) (Fig. 1A). The recovery of activity was not enhanced by increasing the concentrations of heparin or serum, but we observed a strong dependence on the concentration of NaCl (Fig. 1B). Maximal recovery (∼40%) was achieved in buffer containing 20% serum and 2.0 m NaCl (Fig. 1B). Heparin had a marginal effect at low concentrations of NaCl (<0.5 m), but was ineffective at higher concentrations (Fig. 1B). Reactivation did not occur in buffer with 2.0 m NaCl in the absence of serum, supporting the view that serum was crucial (data not shown). Further experiments demonstrated that reactivation was obtained also upon incubation at 25 or 37 °C (Fig. 1C). The time needed to reach optimal recovery of activity was shortened from 18 h at 10 °C to 2–5 h at the higher temperatures. The maximal yield of LPL activity was lower at 37 °C (only ∼20%) than at 25 and 10 °C (at which it was 40%) (Fig. 1C). The recovery of LPL activity was dependent on the sufficient reduction of the residual concentration of GdmCl after dilution into the solution used for refolding. Maximal recovery was achieved when the GdmCl concentration was 0.1 m or less (Fig. 1D). Calcium Is the Crucial Component in Serum Responsible for Refolding of LPL into the Active State—To determine the component(s) in serum necessary to support the reactivation of LPL, we first compared human and rat sera, which were found to be equally effective (TABLE ONE). Lipoprotein-depleted serum had no effect, and isolated lipoprotein fractions (VLDL, low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL)) were also ineffective. Likewise, heat-inactivated rat serum (dialyzed against buffer containing EDTA after centrifugation) did not support reactivation of LPL, indicating that the necessary component might be heat-labile. This notion was overruled by the use of heated human serum recovered after centrifugation, but without dialysis. Dialysis against EDTA is a common procedure to recover lipoprotein-depleted serum as well as lipoprotein fractions after ultracentrifugation (35Lindgren F.T. Jensen L.C. Hatch F.T. Nelson C.J. Blood Lipids and Lipoproteins: Quantitation, Composition, and Metabolism. Wiley InterScience, New York1972: 181-272Google Scholar). When human serum was mixed with EDTA (or dialyzed against EDTA), it could no longer promote reactivation of denatured LPL (TABLE ONE). These results suggested that the crucial component in serum was chelated by EDTA. Among the metal ions tested, Ca2+ was the only one that could promote LPL activation (TABLE ONE). Compared with serum, Ca2+ (2.5–5 mm) gave a lower recovery of LPL activity (20% recovery compared with 38.5 ± 4.5% with serum). Elevated recovery of LPL activity by Ca2+ was observed if an additional agent, such as 10% glycerol or 0.1% BSA, was included in the refolding buffer, which presumably stabilized the active form. Similar effects were also seen upon addition of lipoproteins (VLDL, HDL, or LDL). A combination of lipoproteins and Ca2+ gave a similar recovery of LPL activity compared with serum (data not shown). The recovery was also similar whether or not LPL had been denatured in the presence of reducing agent (β-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol). In the following experiments, LPL was denatured in the absence of reducing agent, and 2.5 mm Ca2+ was used for refolding because the recovery with 1.25 mm Ca2+ was slightly lower and that with 0.5 mm Ca2+ was only 50% compared with the recovery obtained at 2 or 2.5 mm Ca2+.TABLE ONEIdentification of components in serum essential for reactivation of fully denatured LPLAdditivesRecovery of LPL activity% of initial activityHuman or rat serum (20% (v/v))38 ± 4.5Lipoprotein-depleted serum (20% (v/v), dialyzed against EDTA)NDLDL (0.4-1 mg/ml)NDVLDL (0.08-0.2 mg/ml)NDHDL (0.2-0.5 mg/ml)NDBSA (0.25-3 mg/ml)NDGlycerol (10%)NDHeat-inactivated rat serum (20% (v/v), 56 °C, dialyzed against EDTA)NDHeat-inactivated human serum (20% (v/v), 56 or 100 °C, no dialysis)20 ± 4.3Human serum (20% (v/v), with 10-50 mm EDTA)NDK+ (0.5-2 mm)NDMg2+ (0.5-5 mm)NDZn2+ (0.01-1 mm)NDCu2+ (0.1-2 mm)NDCa2+ (2.5-5 mm)20 ± 3.1Ca2+ (2.5 mm) + glycerol (10%) or BSA (0.1-1%)30 ± 3.1Ca2+ (2.5 mm) + VLDL (0.08-0.2 mg/ml)43 ± 4.3Ca2+ (2.5 mm) + LDL (0.2-0.5 mg/ml)43 ± 3.8Ca2+ (2.5 mm) + HDL (0.4-1 mg/ml)41 ± 3.3 Open table in a new tab"
https://openalex.org/W2053345485,"Aspirin is effective in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases, because it causes acetylation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) leading to irreversible inhibition of platelets. Additional mechanisms can be suspected, because patients treated with other platelet COX inhibitors such as indomethacin do not display an increased bleeding tendency as observed for aspirin-treated patients. Recently, aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs were shown to induce shedding of L-selectin in neutrophils in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner. Therefore, we investigated the effects of aspirin on the von Willebrand Factor receptor complex glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX, whose lack or dysfunction causes bleeding in patients. As quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in whole blood, aspirin, but not its metabolite salicylic acid, induced dose-dependent shedding of human and murine GPIbα and GPV from the platelet surface, whereas other glycoproteins remained unaffected by this treatment. Biotinylated fragments of GPV were detected by immunoprecipitation in the supernatant of washed mouse platelets, and the expression level of GPIbα was decreased in these platelets as measured by Western blot analysis. Although shedding occurred normally in COX-1-deficient murine platelets, shedding was completely blocked by a broad-range metalloproteinase inhibitor and, more importantly, in mouse platelets expressing an inactive form of ADAM17. Shed fragments of GPIbα and GPV were elevated in the plasma of aspirin-injected mice compared with animals injected with control buffer. These data demonstrate that aspirin at high concentrations induces shedding of GPIbα and GPV by an ADAM17-dependent mechanism and that this process can occur in vivo.

The activation of platelets at sites of vascular injury, followed by controlled aggregate formation, is required for normal hemostasis, but can cause thrombosis in pathologically altered arteries leading to myocardial infarction or stroke (1Ruggeri Z.M.

This mechanism appears to be a major component contributing to the anti-inflammatory action of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as treatment with NSAIDs, including acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) down-regulates L-selectin in these cells in an ADAM17-dependent manner (8Gomez-Gaviro M.V.

Although the effect of NSAIDs on L-selectin expression seems to be linked to the uncoupling capability of these compounds (10Mahmud T. Rafi S.S. Scott D.L. Wrigglesworth J.M. Bjarnason I. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 1998-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the precise molecular mechanism(s) involved remain unclear. It is well established that aspirin at therapeutically relevant concentrations (up to 2 mm) (11Higgs G.A. Salmon J.A. Henderson B. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1417-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Rainsford K.D. Schweitzer A. Brune K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) causes irreversible acetylation of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) thereby inhibiting the generation of the platelet activator thromboxane A2 (13Vane J.R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7367) Google Scholar). This mechanism is thought to account for the effect of aspirin in the prevention of coronary artery and cerebroascular thrombosis (14Awtry E.H. Loscalzo J. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1206-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 15Fitzgerald G.A. Lancet. 2003; 361: 542-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, not all clinical observations can be explained by this mechanism. Aspirin treatment causes an increased bleeding tendency in uremic patients compared with healthy volunteers, although COX was completely inhibited in all subjects tested (16Gaspari F. Vigano G. Orisio S. Bonati M. Livio M. Remuzzi G. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1788-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, ibuprofen, a member of the NSAID family, at a dose that fully inhibits COX-1 activity did not significantly prolong bleeding time in these patients indicating a second anti-platelet mechanism of aspirin distinct from COX-1 inhibition (16Gaspari F. Vigano G. Orisio S. Bonati M. Livio M. Remuzzi G. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1788-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This is supported by in vivo findings demonstrating an increase in bleeding time of high dose aspirin-treated rabbits, which was not related to COX-1 blockage (17Buchanan M.R. Rischke J.A. Hirsh J. Thromb. Res. 1982; 25: 363-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the effects of aspirin on platelet function at low and high concentrations. In whole blood flow adhesion studies on immobilized collagen, virtually no thrombus formation was observed in platelets treated with high aspirin concentrations, whereas low dose aspirin caused a moderately reduced thrombus size and surface coverage under high shear flow conditions. This severe effect of high dose aspirin was due to shedding of GPIbα and of GPV, as shown by flow cytometry and Western blot in both human and murine platelets. Aspirin-induced shedding occurred in COX-1 but not in mouse platelets expressing functionally inactive ADAM17, and injection of mice with high doses of aspirin resulted in an increased level of GPIbα and GPV fragments in the plasma. These data demonstrate that aspirin at high concentrations induces shedding of surface receptors by an ADAM17-dependent mechanism and that this process can occur in vivo. Animals—All animal experiments and care were approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee. ADAM17 mutant mice (7Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Amgen. Both mutant and wild-type control animals as well as COX-1-deficient mice were of 129/Sv x C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds and were used at the ages of 10–16 weeks. To obtain platelets lacking functional ADAM17 (ADAM17 lacking zinc-binding domain; ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn), bone marrow chimeras were produced (5Bergmeier W. Piffath C.L. Cheng G. Dole V.S. Zhang Y. von Andrian U.H. Wagner D.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Platelet Preparation and Aggregation Studies—Whole blood was taken from anesthetized mice from the retro-orbital plexus and collected in TBS containing 20 units/ml heparin and washed platelets were obtained as described previously (18Nieswandt B. Schulte V. Bergmeier W. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Rackebrandt K. Cazenave J.P. Ohlmann P. Gachet C. Zirngibl H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole blood was drawn from the retro-orbital plexus of anesthetized mice and collected in Tris-buffered saline containing 20 units/ml heparin. After washing the platelets twice with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, 0.35% bovine serum albumin), platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 to 2 × 106 platelets/μl. To determine platelet aggregation, light transmission was measured using platelet-rich plasma. Transmission was recorded in a Fibrintimer 4 channel aggregometer (APACT Laborgeräte und Analysensysteme, Hamburg, Germany) over 10 min and was expressed as arbitrary units with 100% transmission adjusted with plasma. Antibodies and Chemicals—Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspisol®) was purchased via a local pharmacy. JON/A-PE, which binds to activated integrin αIIbβ3 (19Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Brockhoff G. Bier U. Zirngibl H. Nieswandt B. Cytometry. 2002; 48: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and all other anti-mouse antibodies were from Emfret Analytics, Würzburg, Germany. Anti-human GPIbα and anti-human GPV antibodies were from Immunotools, Friesoythe, Germany. All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. Flow Cytometry—Whole blood was taken from healthy volunteers that did not take any platelet-affecting drugs 2 weeks prior the experiment and was collected in a citrate buffer (100 μm sodium citrate, 7 μm citric acid, 140 μm glucose, pH 6.5). Whole human or murine blood samples were left untreated or were incubated with acetylsalicylic acid at 37 °C for the indicated times. The samples were diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline and then stained with fluorophore-conjugated monoclonal antibodies at saturating concentrations for 15 min at room temperature and analyzed directly on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Platelets were identified by forward scatter/SSC characteristics. Adhesion under Flow Conditions—Heparinized human blood (1 vol) was collected into 0.5 vol of HEPES buffer, pH 7.45, containing 137 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 120 μm d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone, and 15 units/ml heparin. Rectangular coverslips (24 × 60 mm) were coated with 0.25 mg/ml “Horm type” fibrillar collagen (Nycomed, Munich) for 1 h at 37 °C and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Perfusion of whole blood was performed as described (20Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Briefly, transparent flow chambers with a slit depth of 50 μm, equipped with the collagen-coated coverslips, were rinsed with HEPES buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 unit/ml heparin and connected to a syringe filled with the anti-coagulated blood. Perfusion was performed at room temperature with a pulse-free pump at high shear stress (4 min, flow rate of 7.53 ml/h, equivalent to a wall shear rate of 1000 s–1). During perfusion, microscopic phase-contrast images were recorded in real-time. Thereafter, the chambers were rinsed by a 4-min perfusion with HEPES buffer, pH 7.45 (2 mm CaCl2 and 1 unit/ml heparin), at the same shear stress. Phase-contrast images were recorded (×63 objectives). Western Blot Analysis—For immunoblotting, washed platelets were lysed, separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5%) under reducing conditions, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with horseradish-conjugated anti-GPIbα monoclonal antibody for 1 h, and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoprecipitation—Washed mouse platelets were surface-labeled with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (25 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, from Pierce) and subsequently incubated with acetylsalicylic acid for the indicated time points and then centrifuged (2000 × g, 10 min). Supernatants were then collected and incubated with 10 μg of anti-GPV monoclonal antibody and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1 μg/ml) for 1 h after blocking. After extensive washing, biotinylated proteins were visualized by ECL. ELISA—To detect cleaved GPV (GPV f1) or GPIbα (glycocalicin) by ELISA (6Rabie T. Strehl A. Ludwig A. Nieswandt B. J. Biol.

Blood. 2000; 95: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), washed platelets were treated as indicated, and supernatants (from 300 μlof0.5 × 109 platelets) were cleared by 10-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Alternatively, blood was collected retro-orbitally from mice treated with aspirin at the indicated doses, and plasma was produced by centrifugation. The samples were transferred to anti-GPV (20 μg/ml)- or anti-GPIbα (pOp3, 20 μg/ml)-coated ELISA plates, incubated for 1 h at 37°C, and washed three times with buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml followed by 1-h incubation at 37 °C and detected with tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 m sulfonic acid and analyzed by WinRead. Aspirin Selectively Induces Down-regulation of Human GPIbα and GPV—Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) prevents myocardial infarction and stroke in patients. To examine the effect of aspirin on thrombus formation under high shear flow conditions in vitro, we incubated human blood with increasing concentrations of aspirin for 2 h and studied platelet adhesion to collagen. Although untreated platelets adhered and formed stable and large thrombi, therapeutically relevant concentrations of aspirin sufficient to completely inhibit COX-1 (2 mm) (22Hoogendijk E.M.G. Tencate J.W. Lancet. 1980; 1: 93-94Abstract PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Jakubowski J.A. Bush H.L. Deykin D. Thrombosis and Haemostasis. 1983; 50: 189Google Scholar) caused a moderate decrease in thrombus formation (Fig. 1A). Surface coverage was modestly lower (Fig. 1B), and thrombus size and stability were slightly reduced under these conditions confirming previous observations (24Andre P. LaRocca T. Delaney S.M.

Surprisingly, higher concentrations of aspirin (20 mm) dramatically reduced the number of adherent platelets and virtually abrogated thrombus formation. This indicated an anti-platelet mechanism of high dose aspirin that is different from the inhibition of COX-1 and directly interferes with platelet adhesion on collagen under conditions of elevated shear (Fig. 1, A and B). It is known that a number of platelet receptors that are involved in the initial adhesion process, including GPV and GPIbα, are proteolytically down-regulated from the cell surface in response to various agonists (6Rabie T. Strehl A. Ludwig A. Nieswandt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14462-14468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Bergmeier W. Rabie T. Strehl A. Piffath C.L. Prostredna M. Wagner D.D. Nieswandt B. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 91: 951-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, NSAIDs, including aspirin, have been shown to induce shedding of L-selectin in neutrophils (8Gomez-Gaviro M.V. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Carretero J.M. Sabando P. Gonzalez-Alvaro I. Sanchez-Madrid F. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Blood. 2000; 96: 3592-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gomez-Gaviro M.V. Gonzalez-Alvaro I. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Peschon J. Black R.A. Sanchez-Madrid F. Diaz-Gonzalez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38212-38221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspected that high concentrations of aspirin could affect the surface expression of platelet receptors. To test this hypothesis, we incubated whole blood with different concentrations of aspirin and measured the surface expression of prominent glycoproteins on the platelet surface by flow cytometry. Indeed, aspirin caused a dose-dependent down-regulation of GPV and GPIbα (Fig. 1, C and D), whereas the expression levels of other glycoproteins, including GPVI, β3-, or α5β1 integrin remained largely unaffected (Fig. 1E). Importantly, the surface levels of GPIbβ were also virtually unchanged, suggesting that the down-regulation of GPV and GPIbα had occurred through ectodomain shedding rather than internalization (21Bergmeier W. Rackebrandt K. Schroder W. Zirngibl H. Nieswandt B. Blood. 2000; 95: 886-893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aspirin Causes Down-regulation of GPIbα and GPV in Murine Platelets—To characterize the mechanisms underlying this unexpected aspirin effect in detail and to identify the responsible metalloproteinase involved, we used the mouse as a model for further experiments. To test whether the observed effect can also be detected in the mouse system, murine whole blood was incubated with aspirin at different concentrations, and the expression of glycoproteins on the platelet surface was measured by flow cytometry at different time points. In these experiments, aspirin caused a dose-dependent down-regulation of GPIbα and GPV (Fig. 2, A–D), whereas no such effect was seen for other glycoproteins, including GPIbβ, GPVI, or αIIbβ3or α5β1-integrins (Fig. 1E). Aggregation experiments revealed that the cells were still responsive to different agonists. As shown in Fig. 2E, maximal aggregation induced by ADP, thrombin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or collagen was slightly reduced in washed platelets incubated with 2 mm aspirin for 2 h. In the case of PMA and collagen, the onset of aggregation was moderately delayed reflecting lack of thromboxane A2 release due to COX-1 inhibition. Similar results were obtained in platelets that were incubated with high dose aspirin (10 mm). Maximal aggregation was reduced compared with untreated platelets, and the delay in the onset of aggregation in PMA- or collagen-stimulated samples was increased to a similar extent as observed for platelets that were incubated with low dose aspirin (2 mm). This demonstrated that incubation of platelets with high doses of aspirin induces shedding of GPV and GPIbα but largely preserves the signaling machinery required for aggregation. In all experiments (in mice or humans), we used lysine-coupled aspirin, because acetylsalicylic acid alone is very poorly water-soluble. Therefore, to exclude any lysine-mediated artificial effects, lysine was tested in parallel (10 mm). As shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), lysine alone, at concentrations at which aspirin induced shedding, did not alter GPIbα or GPV expression demonstrating that a specific aspirin-related mechanism was responsible for the observed shedding. Under in vitro and in vivo conditions, aspirin is rapidly deacetylated to release salicylic acid. To delineate which compound is involved in aspirin-induced shedding, whole blood was incubated with salicylic acid (10 mm). As shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), salicylic acid did not cause down-regulation of murine GPIbα or GPV strongly suggesting that aspirin causes shedding via an acetylation-dependent mechanism. Similar results using lysine or salicylic acid were obtained with human platelets (not shown). Aspirin Induces Shedding via Metalloproteinase Activation in Human and Mouse Platelets—Recent studies suggest an involvement of metalloproteinases in receptor shedding in platelets as well as in leukocytes (9Gomez-Gaviro M.V. Gonzalez-Alvaro I. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Peschon J. Black R.A. Sanchez-Madrid F. Diaz-Gonzalez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38212-38221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Bergmeier W. Rabie T. Strehl A. Piffath C.L. Prostredna M. Wagner D.D. Nieswandt B. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 91: 951-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test an involvement of sheddases in our system, we incubated whole blood either with vehicle or aspirin in the presence or absence of the broad-range metalloproteinase inhibitor GM-6001 (100 μm). The protein kinase C activator PMA (500 ng/ml) is a well known activator of metalloproteinase-dependent shedding and therefore was used in our control experiments. After incubation of washed platelets with aspirin for 2 h, platelets were centrifuged and the supernatant was collected to detect the shed fragments of GPIbα (glycocalicin) and GPV. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), GPIbα and GPV were found in the supernatant of PMA- and aspirin-treated samples. Release of both glycoproteins was blocked completely in the presence of 100 μm GM-6001 showing that metalloproteinases are involved in this process. Whereas aspirin and PMA induced the release of an 80-kDa fragment of GPV, thrombin directly cleaved GPV at a different site resulting in a smaller fragment size (69 kDa). Accordingly, remaining fragments of GPIbα after aspirin treatment were found in the platelet membrane. In parallel experiments, shedding of murine and human GPIbα and GPV was quantitatively determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. In the presence of the broad-range metalloproteinase inhibitor GM-6001, shedding was blocked comparably in both murine (Fig. 3C) and human platelets (Fig. 3D). In parallel experiments, the effect of ibuprofen and indomethacin on GPIbα and GPV levels was tested in dose-response experiments. For up to 4 h, neither ibuprofen (10 μm to 20 mm, not shown) nor indomethacin (1–200 μm) induced significant shedding of the two receptors. The results for the highest concentration of indomethacin (200 μm) are shown in Fig. 3C. Aspirin-induced Shedding Is COX-independent but Essentially Involves ADAM17 Activation—It is well established that aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet function by acetylating COX-1 at serine 530 (13Vane J.R.

In our experiments, inhibition of COX-1 by established inhibitors such as indomethacin and aspirin at low dose (2 mm) did not alter the expression levels of GPIbα or GPV (Fig. 3C) suggesting that shedding occurs independently of COX inhibition. To test this directly, we analyzed platelets from COX-1-deficient mice. In these platelets, aspirin induced shedding of GPIbα and GPV to a similar extent and with similar kinetics as in wild-type mice (Fig. 4) demonstrating that COX-1 is not essentially involved in aspirin-induced shedding of these receptors. In neutrophils, ectodomain shedding of L-selectin occurs in an ADAM17-dependent manner (9Gomez-Gaviro M.V. Gonzalez-Alvaro I. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Peschon J. Black R.A. Sanchez-Madrid F. Diaz-Gonzalez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38212-38221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown that ADAM17 is the metalloproteinase that mediates GPIbα and GPV shedding from the platelet surface (5Bergmeier W.

Chem. 2005; 280: 14462-14468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To test directly whether the shedding of these receptors in response to aspirin is mediated by ADAM17, we used chimeric mice that express inactive ADAM17 in blood cells only. For that purpose, we transplanted irradiated wild-type recipient mice with fetal liver cells isolated from ADAM17+/+ embryos or embryos carrying a targeted of the deletion Zn2+-binding domain in mice (ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn) (7Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J.

Although normal shedding occurred in control platelets in response to aspirin (150 mm), this process was completely abrogated in ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn platelets (Fig. 4). This finding demonstrated that aspirin stimulates shedding of GPIbα and GPV in an ADAM17-dependent manner.

The heterodimeric partner of PPARγ receptor is the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (7.Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). In overexpression studies, binding of ligand to the RXR receptor has been reported to result in the recruitment of coactivators to the RXR/PPARγ heterodimer (8.Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and increased transcription from idealized peroxisomal proliferator response elements (PPREs). Some RXR activators can increase transcription of genes in vitro that are also increased by PPARγ ligands (8.Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 9.Schulman I.G. Shao G. Heyman R.A. Mol. Cell.

Heyman R.A. Nadzan A.M. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and administration of specific, high affinity RXR agonists to hyperglycemic ob/ob (11.Lenhard J.M. Lancaster M.E. Paulik M.A. Weiel J.E. Binz J.G. Sundseth S.S. Gaskill B.A. Lightfoot R.M. Brown H.R.

Nadzan A.M. Paterniti Jr., J.R. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) mice is effective in lowering glucose levels. These results have led to the hypothesis that the antihyperglycemic effect of RXR agonists is due to transactivation of the PPARγ/RXR heterodimer. In contrast, other studies suggest that in vivo, specific RXR and PPARγ ligands regulate the expression of different genes in adipose tissue and liver, suggesting distinct mechanisms for glucose lowering by these ligands (13.Davies P.J. Berry S.A. Shipley G.L. Eckel R.H. Hennuyer N. Crombie D.L. Ogilvie K.M. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Fievet C. Leibowitz M.D. Heyman R.A. Auwerx J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report showed a different effect of the rexinoid LG268 and the PPARγ activator rosiglitazone on signal pathways in skeletal muscle of diabetic (db/db) mice (14.Shen Q. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Leibowitz M.D. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19721-19731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although both result in a significant increases in insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in skeletal muscle, LG268 increased Irs-1 and Akt phosphorylation while rosiglitazone increased the levels of CAP expression and insulin-stimulated c-Cbl phosphorylation without having an effect on the Irs-1/Akt pathway, suggesting distinct sensitizing pathways. In preliminary studies, we used microarrays to evaluate gene expression in insulin-responsive tissue of diabetic ZFF rats following treatment with the high affinity RXR ligand AGN194204 or troglitazone, a prototypical PPARγ agonist. We found distinct populations of genes were regulated by each compound. 3C. F. Burant, unpublished observation. In light of this finding, we sought to systematically evaluate the ability of these compounds to increase transcription in vitro and determine their pharmacological activities in vivo. We also utilized a new gene array analysis tool to gain insight into the pharmacological effects of AGN194204. We found that the AGN194204 does not transactivate PPARγ in vitro and lowers glucose in vivo only by suppressing hepatic glucose production without affecting peripheral insulin sensitivity. We also utilized a novel gene expression analysis tool to identify the potential pathways in the liver that contribute to the ability of RXR agonists to lower liver glucose production. Transient Transfection Studies—CV-1 cells were grown in 6-well plates with minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and l-glutamine (2 mm). Cells were transfected with plasmids pGL3Luc containing the PPRE fragment of the fatty acid transport protein (FATP) or the acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) PPRE (0.5 μg) with or without expression constructs pcDNA3 containing RXRα and/or PPARγ (0.5 μg) using Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). CMV-β-galactosidase DNA (5 ng) was co-transfected for normalization of transfection efficiency. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with different concentrations of troglitazone, AGN194204, AGN195203, or LG100268. After 24 h, cells were extracted and the luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity were measured using the Dual-light assay system (Tropix, Inc., Foster City, CA). Data are expressed as the ratio of Luc/β-galactosidase activity. Animals and Biochemical Measurements—Female Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF/Gmi-fa/fa; “ZFF” rats) were purchased from Genetic Models, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN) at 5–6 weeks of age and were fed with a semipurified high fat diet (48% fat, 16% protein, diet 13004) prepared by Research Diets Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ). All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at Park-Davis, Inc. and at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. After the animals became hyperglycemic (fed blood glucose > 250 mg/dl, 3–4 weeks on the diet) they were treated orally with vehicle (carboxymethylcellulose), troglitazone (400 mg/kg), or AGN194204 (1 mg/kg) (15.Beard R.L. Colon D.F. Song T.K. Davies P.J. Kochhar D.M. Chandraratna R.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3556-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) at 10 a.m. for 7 days. On the morning of the 8th day, the animals were anesthetized and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Whole blood glucose was determined using a Hemocue (Angelholm, Sweden), serum triglycerides were determined using a colorimetric assay (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), and serum insulin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco, St. Louis, MO) using rat insulin standards. In some experiments, control C57Bl/6 or db/db mice on a C57Bl/6 background (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were treated with vehicle or with AGN194204 or AGN195203 (both at 1 mg/kg) for 1, 3, or 7 days. The livers were removed and subjected to either gene expression profiling or Northern and Western blotting as described below. Euglycemic, Hyperinsulinemic Clamp in ZFF Rats—After ∼24 days on the diet, indwelling catheters were surgically implanted in the jugular vein and carotid artery of rats. Starting 3–5 days after surgery, rats were treated with AGN194204 or troglitazone as described above. The clamp procedure was initiated in the morning of day 8, following overnight food restriction (6–7 g after 6:00 p.m.). One hour before starting the glucose and insulin infusions (t =–60 min), a prime-continuous infusion (15 μCi of bolus, 0.15 μ Ci/min) of high-performance liquid chromatography-purified [3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was initiated. At t =–30 min, four arterial plasma samples were obtained at 10-min intervals for determination of plasma glucose specific activity in the basal state. At t = 0 min, a prime-continuous infusion of porcine insulin (72 milliunits · kg–1 · min–1; Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN) was initiated. Plasma glucose concentration, determined every 5–10 min, was maintained at 100–110 mg/dl by a variable infusion of 45% dextrose. Steady state was generally achieved within 120–150 min, at which time four arterial plasma samples were obtained at 10-min intervals for determination of plasma glucose specific activity. Plasma [3H]glucose specific activity was measured after barium hydroxide-zinc sulfate precipitation. Aliquots of the supernatant were evaporated to dryness to eliminate tritiated water prior to counting. In a subset of clamp animals, in vivo glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was determined using the 2-deoxyglucose bolus technique (16.James D.E. Jenkins A.B. Kraegen E.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E567-E574PubMed Google Scholar) at ∼150 min after initiation of the insulin infusion. Tissue accumulation of 2-deoxyglucose was assessed by counting neutralized perchloric acid extracts before (free and phosphorylated) and after (free) barium hydroxide-zinc sulfate precipitation. Assessment of Liver Insulin Signaling following in Vivo Insulin Administration—Following an overnight fast, three ZFF rats from each treatment group were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. A bolus of saline (1.0 ml) was administered via a catheter placed in the jugular vein. The lateral head of the right gastrocnemius muscle was rapidly excised and clamp frozen (basal). A bolus of insulin (10 units/kg body weight in 1.0 ml of saline) was injected via the catheter. The liver and the lateral head of the left gastrocnemius were clamp frozen at 60 and 120 s, respectively, following insulin administration. Liver and muscle lysates were prepared according to the method of Saad et al. (17.Saad M.J. Folli F. Araki E. Hashimoto N. Csermely P. Kahn C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with commercially available antibodies against the Irs-1 or Irs-2 proteins, Akt (purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA), p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3′-kinase (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), or phospho-Akt (Ser-473) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). GeneChip Analysis—GeneChip analysis was performed according to the standard Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) protocol using liver RNA from four C57Bl/6J mice treated for 7 days with AGN194204. Following probe preparation according to the manufacturer's instructions, the fragmented cRNAs were hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChips using quantitative controls, processed, and scanned according to the manufacturer. A total of 1,466 genes prefiltered to have an average difference score of >100 and showed a mean change (both decrease and increase) in expression level by at least 1.5-fold between treated and control samples were used for the network generation and pathway analysis. Gen-Bank™ accession numbers were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Application Tool (Ingenuity Systems). Of these, 741 genes were mapped to the Ingenuity Knowledge Base, which were assembled into biological networks and were ranked by score. The score is the likelihood of a set of genes being found in the networks due to random chance (supplemental Table S1). A score of 3 indicates that there is a 1/1000 chance that the focus genes are in a network due to random chance. Therefore, scores of 3 or higher have a 99.9% confidence of not being generated by random chance alone. This score was used as the cut-off for identifying gene networks significantly affected by treatment with AGN194204. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from liver was subjected to Northern analysis with the indicated cDNA probes, obtained either from the American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA) or generated by PCR amplification and confirmed by direct sequencing. The blots were washed and subjected to autoradiography and quantified by phosphorimaging. Western Blotting—Membrane fractions for sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) determination from mouse or rat liver were prepared as previously described (18.Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of protein was separated on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with polyclonal antibody SREBP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and developed with ECL reagent using goat anti-rabbit antisera. For FAS protein determination, liver tissues were homogenized in extraction buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 1 h .25 μg of protein from the supernatant fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against FAS (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA). Real-time Reverse-transcription PCR—Total RNA from rat livers (1 μg) was used for reverse transcription reaction in accordance to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison WI). Real-time PCR was performed on a DNA Engine Opticon PCR cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA), by using the following protocol: one cycle of 15 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, and plate read, 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 °C, and 1 cycle of melting curve from 65 °C to 95 °C. For FoxA2, the anneal temperature is 56 °C. The following synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used in real-time PCR: rGnas (forward, 5′-ACGCCTCCCCGAGACGTGCGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGACGGAGTCACCCATTAGTG-3′), rGnai2 (forward, 5′-AGCCCCCTGACCATCTGTTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTGCCCCTCAGAAGAGGCCAC-3′), rGnb2 (forward, 5-ATCAGATGATGCCACATGTCG-3′; reverse, 5′-ACAGCCATCCCATCATCTGTG-3′), rFoxA2 (forward, 5′-ATCAACAACCTCATGTCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-CGAGTTCATAATAGGCCTG-3′), rFoxA3 (forward, 5′-CACCCTATTTCACTGGCCTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GAACCGGTCATCTGTCACAGC-3′), rGlut2 (forward, 5′-ACATCCTACTTGGCCTATCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCAACGCCGATGGTTGCATAC-3′), rGcgr (forward, 5′-AGGGTCTGCTGGTGGCTGTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTCTTCGCAGAGGGCTCACAG-3′), and universal 18 S (forward, 5′-ACTCAACACGGGAAACCTCACC-3′; reverse, 5′-CCAGACAAATCGCTCCACCAAC-3′). Results of the real-time PCR data were calculated from Ct values where Ct was defined as the threshold cycle of PCR that the amplified product was first detected. The PCR reaction and protocol for the 18 S ribosome were the same as described above. ΔCt was the difference in the Ct values derived from the specific gene being assayed and the 18 S control, whereas ΔCt represented the difference between the paired tissue samples, as calculated by the formula ΔCt =ΔCt of wild type tissue–ΔCt of other tissue. The n-fold differential expression in a specific gene of a sample compared with the wild type counterpart is expressed as 2Ct. Relative RNA equivalents for each sample were obtained by normalizing to 18 S levels. Each of the 3 samples per group was run in duplicate to determine sample reproducibility, and the average relative RNA equivalents per sample pair was used for further analysis. cAMP Assay in HepG2 Cells—HepG2 cells were grown in 6-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and treated with 10 μm troglitazone or 500 nm AGN194204 for 48 h. Cells were starved for 2 h and then incubated with 100 nm glucagon for 30 min, extracted, and assayed for cAMP according to the manufacture's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by Student's t test or analysis of variance with Turkey's post-hoc testing as appropriate using SAS. Differences were determined to be significant at p < 0.05. RXR Agonists Do Not Transactivate PPARγ—The RXR agonists used in this study, AGN194204 and AGN195203, were selected as potent activators of RXR subtype homodimers (15.Beard R.L. Colon D.F. Song T.K. Davies P.J. Kochhar D.M. Chandraratna R.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3556-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The compounds show no activity toward retinoic acid receptor subtypes (not shown). We determined the ability of these RXR compounds to drive transcription in the context of PPARγ/RXR heterodimers. CV-1 cells, which contain endogenous PPARγ and RXR receptors, were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing the PPRE from either the ACO or FATP promoter. The PPARγ agonist troglitazone increased transcription nearly 3-fold, whereas treatment with AGN194204 and AG195203 caused non-significant increases in transcription from the ACO promoter (Fig. 1A). When AGN194204 and troglitazone were added together, the TZD-induced transcriptional activity was consistently blunted (Fig. 1B). AGN194204 treatment also significantly blunted transcription induced by the PPARγ ligands rosiglitazone and non-thiazolidinedione GI62570 (not shown). Overexpression of RXRα, or RXRα and PPARγ, into CV-1 cells resulted in an increase of ACO-luc activity in response to RXR agonist treatments (Fig. 1B). Because the ACO promoter can be activated in the absence of PPAR (19.Krey G. Mahfoudi A. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the RXR homodimer is binding to the PPRE of the ACO promoter and activating transcription. We also evaluated transcriptional activity using the FATP PPRE, which binds the PPARγ/RXR heterodimer in preference to RXR or PPARγ homodimers (20.Corsetti J.P. Sparks J.D. Peterson R.G. Smith R.L. Sparks C.E. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 148: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this context, treatment with troglitazone increased luciferase expression to nearly 3-fold, whereas neither AGN194204 nor LG100268 (another RXR agonist (21.Liu Y.L. Sennitt M.V. Hislop D.C. Crombie D.L. Heyman R.A. Cawthorne M.A. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2000; 24: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) induced luciferase reporter expression above baseline (Fig. 1C). Thus, in contrast to previous reports (8.Martin G. Schoonjans K. Lefebvre A.M. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28210-28217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 9.Schulman I.G. Shao G. Heyman R.A. Mol.

Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the agents used in the present study show no ability to transactivate PPARγ/RXR. We also found that rats treated with AGN194204 showed no induction of PPARγ target genes in adipocytes following treatment with the RXR agonist (data not shown) suggesting minimal transactivation of PPARγ in vivo. Metabolic Effects of AGN194204 and Troglitazone in ZFF Rats—Previous studies have suggested a peripheral insulin-sensitizing effect of RXR agonists. To investigate the effect of AGN194204 and AGN195203, we studied the physiological effect of these agents in ZFF. ZFF rats become diabetic after ∼3 weeks feeding of high fat diet (20.Corsetti J.P. Sparks J.D. Peterson R.G. Smith R.L. Sparks C.E. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 148: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Treatment of 9- to 10-week-old diabetic ZFF rats (ZFF-diabetic) with AGN194204 (1 mg/kg), AGN195203 (not shown), or troglitazone (400 mg/kg) orally for 7 days lowered blood glucose and insulin to control levels (Fig. 2A). In contrast to troglitazone, AGN194204 treatment resulted in markedly elevated triglyceride (Fig. 2A) and free fatty acid levels (not shown). ZFF rats treated with AGN195203 showed the same glucose lowering and triglyceride elevating effects (data not shown). Thus, like other RXR agonists, AGN194204 and AGN195203 are effective antihyperglycemic agents but also increase of serum lipid levels. Site of Action of AGN194204 and Troglitazone by Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp—We next performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with tracer [3H]glucose infusion in a separate group of ZFF rats to determine the degree of insulin sensitization in the liver and peripheral tissue afforded by each agent. ZFF rats fed high fat diet (ZFF-diabetic) for 5 weeks were ∼20 g heavier, and had significantly higher fasting serum glucose and insulin concentrations than those rats fed a standard chow diet (TABLE ONE). Treatment of the diabetic rats with AGN194204 or with troglitazone resulted in an additional increase in body weight (5.8% and 11.3%, respectively).TABLE ONEFasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in ZFF rats following 7 days of treatment with RXR or PPARγ agonistsBody weightPlasma glucosePlasma insulingmg/dlng/mlObese (9.Schulman I.G.

Suppression of EGP by insulin during the hyperinsulinemic phase of the clamp was impaired in the diabetic rats, such that glucose production during steady-state in the diabetics was 2-fold higher than that in obese controls, even in the face of significantly higher steady-state insulin concentrations. Treatment of ZFF-diabetic with AGN194204 or troglitazone restored basal EGP to control levels and completely normalized insulin suppression of EGP during the clamp. The rate of glucose infusion for maintaining steady-state plasma glucose levels in ZFF-diabetic rats during the insulin clamp was 40% less than that required in obese controls (TABLE TWO). Insulin-stimulated whole body glucose disposal (Rd), however, was only slightly lower in the diabetics than in the obese controls (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that the primary effect of the high fat diet in the ZFF female rat is on glucose production by the liver, with little change in insulin action in the already highly insulin-resistant peripheral tissues. Troglitazone treatment increased the rate of insulin-stimulated whole body glucose disposal by ∼50% (versus ZFF-diabetic). Interestingly, ZFF-diabetic rats treated with AGN194204 showed no improvement and even a slight decline in Rd. Thus, although the PPARγ agonist troglitazone improved both peripheral and hepatic insulin actions, the RXR agonists selectively improved glucose metabolism in the liver, with no significant improvements in insulin sensitivity in peripheral tis"

https://openalex.org/W2067500833,"Botulinum neurotoxins (serotypes A-G), the most toxic substances known to humankind, cause flaccid muscle paralysis by blocking acetylcholine release at nerve-muscle junctions through a very specific and exclusive endopeptidase activity against SNARE proteins of presynaptic exocytosis machinery. We have examined polypeptide folding of the endopeptidase moiety of botulinum neurotoxin/A (the light chain) under conditions of its optimal enzymatic activity and have found that one of its stable conformational states is a molten-globule, which retains over 60% of its optimal enzyme activity. More importantly, we have discovered that the light chain acquires a novel pre-imminent molten-globule enzyme conformation at the physiologically relevant temperature, 37 °C. The pre-imminent molten-globule enzyme form also exhibited the maximum endopeptidase activity against its intracellular substrate, SNAP-25 (synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa). These findings will not only open new avenues to design effective diagnostics and antidotes against botulism but also provide new information on enzymatically active molten-globule or molten-globule like structures."

Here we report the results of a flux-limited I-band survey of galaxies at look-back times of 9 to 12 billion years. We find 970 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 1.4 and 5. This population is 1.6 to 6.2 times larger than previous estimates, with the difference increasing towards brighter magnitudes. Strong ultraviolet continua (in the rest frame of the galaxies) indicate vigorous star formation rates of more than 10-100 solar masses per year. As a consequence, the cosmic star formation rate representing the volume-averaged production of stars is higher than previously measured at redshifts of 3 to 4."

https://openalex.org/W2037882895,"Myosin IXb (Myo9b) was reported to be a single-headed, processive myosin. In its head domain it contains an N-terminal extension and a large loop 2 insertion that are specific for class IX myosins. We characterized the kinetic properties of purified, recombinant rat Myo9b, and we compared them with those of Myo9b mutants that had either the N-terminal extension or the loop 2 insertion deleted. Unlike other processive myosins, Myo9b exhibited a low affinity for ADP, and ADP release was not rate-limiting in the ATPase cycle. Myo9b is the first myosin for which ATP hydrolysis or an isomerization step after ATP binding is rate-limiting. Myo9b-ATP appeared to be in a conformation with a weak affinity for actin as determined by pyrene-actin fluorescence. However, in actin cosedimentation experiments, a subpopulation of Myo9b-ATP bound F-actin with a remarkably high affinity. Deletion of the N-terminal extension reduced actin affinity and increased the rate of nucleotide binding. Deletion of the loop 2 insertion reduced the actin affinity and altered the communication between actin and nucleotide-binding sites.

Deletion of the loop 2 insertion reduced the actin affinity and altered the communication between actin and nucleotide-binding sites. The myosins represent a large superfamily of motor molecules that convert the chemical energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force along actin filaments. They have been subdivided into 18 different classes based on homologous myosin head domain sequences (1Hodge T. Cope M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3353-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to a characteristic head domain, all myosins contain a light chain binding domain and a tail domain. The tail domains of some myosins dimerize giving rise to two-headed myosins. Motor properties like direction of movement, speed, step size, duty ratio, processivity, and regulation can vary greatly between various myosins. Movement on actin involves the repeated hydrolysis of ATP by myosins, leading to an ordered cycling between different nucleotide binding states that exhibit different actin binding affinities. Cycling rates and relative time spent in these nucleotide states vary in different myosins, such that the fraction of time a given myosin remains strongly attached to the actin filament during its ATPase cycle differs substantially. Generally, myosin-ATP and myosin-ADP-Pi bind weakly to actin filaments, whereas myosin-ADP and myosin alone bind strongly (2Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In many myosins, e.g. skeletal muscle myosin II, the release of Pi is the rate-limiting step, which means that they spend a large fraction of the total cycling time in a weak actin-binding state. On the other hand, in class V and class VI myosins, the cycle is modified in a way that ADP release is slow and rate-limiting, so these myosins spend most of their cycling time strongly attached to actin (3De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 4De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32373-32381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Myosin V is two-headed and the two heads cooperate to allow for continuous, processive, hand over hand movement along actin filaments (5Forkey J.N. Quinlan M.E. Shaw M.A. Corrie J.E. Goldman Y.E. Nature. 2003; 422: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar).

Despite being a single-headed myosin, it demonstrated typical characteristics of a processive myosin in in vitro motility assays, meaning that it remained attached to actin during successive ATPase cycles (6Post P.L.

Ikebe M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It supported movement of actin filaments at constant rates over a wide range of concentrations and even at high dilutions. At low Myo9b densities, translocating actin filaments were seen pivoting about single points, and analysis of filament landing rates as a function of motor density indicated that a single motor is sufficient for filament movement. Affinity adsorbed human Myo9b from leukocytes was demonstrated to move toward the plus end of actin filaments (8O'Connell C.B. Mooseker M.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 171-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, a recombinant truncated fragment was reported to move toward the minus end of actin filaments (7Inoue A. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Compared with other myosins, Myo9b exhibits in its head domain an N-terminal extension of unknown function with structural homology to Ras binding domains and a large insertion in loop 2, which has been hypothesized to contain a novel actin-binding site that might be necessary for processive movement (9Reinhard J. Scheel A.A. Diekmann D. Hall A. Ruppert C. Bähler M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to being a motor molecule, Myo9b is also a negative regulator of the monomeric G-protein RhoC (10Müller R.T. Honnert U. Reinhard J. Bähler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2039-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Graf B. Bähler M. Hilpelä P. Böwe C. Adam T Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 601-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because RhoC activity regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, Myo9b might control the organization of the actin filaments along which it moves. myosin 9b N-methylanthraniloyl 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) myosin 9b N-methylanthraniloyl 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) Currently, there is nothing known about the biochemical and kinetic adaptations that allow the single-headed Myo9b to remain attached on actin filaments during successive ATPase cycles. Here these questions are addressed by measurements of the fundamental biochemical and kinetic parameters of the ATPase cycle of rat Myo9b. In this study we show that rat Myo9b is a unique myosin with respect to its biochemical properties. Its ATP hydrolysis step is slow and can be rate-limiting, and it has a high affinity for F-actin in various nucleotide states. Myo9b mutants lacking either the loop 2 insertion or the N-terminal extension exhibit differentially altered actin and nucleotide binding properties. Plasmids and Generation of Recombinant Baculoviruses—A hexahistidine tag was introduced at the N terminus of rat Myo9b (myr5) using PCR. The 5′-primer 5′-GCGAATTCCGGACTAGTCCGACCATGGGACATCATCATCATCATCATCACTTGGTCCCTCGTGGAAGCAGTGCTCACGAGGCT-3′ encoded a start codon, six histidines, and a thrombin cleavage site with the amino acid sequence LVPRGS. The original rat Myo9b start codon was removed. The PCR product generated with the reverse primer 5′-CGGTCGACGGATCCGAACACGTGCGGCTCCAGCT-3′ was inserted into the rat Myo9b cDNA using SpeI-BsiWI restriction sites and was verified by sequencing. The C terminus of rat Myo9b was modified by inserting a nucleotide sequence encoding six histidine residues Met-Ser-FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) followed by a stop codon using oligonucleotide linkers. The complete rat Myo9b cDNA with hexa-His tag at the N terminus and hexa-His-FLAG epitope at the C terminus was assembled in the pBSK vector and subcloned into NotI and SmaI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392. A rat Myo9b splice variant (Myo9b SP2) encoding an additional 35 amino acids in the loop 2 insertion was identified by PCR amplification of rat brain marathon ready cDNA (Clontech) using the following primers: 5′-TACTTCCTGGGCACACCAGTCC-3′ and 5′-GGCAGTCCTTTGAGGCTCTTGA-3′ (GenBank™ accession number AJ888904). For subcloning into the original rat Myo9b cDNA, a second PCR was carried out to extend the 3′-end to the KspI site, allowing a NarI-KspI fragment to be added to the pVL1392 rat Myo9b SP2 transfer vector. To generate the construct Myo9b-insert, a PCR was carried out with the primers 5′-TCCAGCATGCCTGTGTAGCGC-3′ and 5′-ATCGGCATGGACCCGGTAGGCG-GCGGCAAGAAGAAGAAGCCGCCC-3′. The latter primer encoded nucleotides 2168-2185 and 2606-2623 flanking either side of the insertion. The codons for three glycine residues were introduced in between. This 209-bp product was used as a megaprimer in a subsequent PCR to amplify an ApaI-SphI fragment using the primers 5′-GGTCGGGCCCCCGGAGGTATT-3′ and 5′-TCCAGCATGCCTGTGTAGCGC-3′. A Myo9b head fragment, digested with KspI that cuts within the insertion, was used as a template. The 948-bp PCR product was used to replace an ApaI-SphI fragment from a pUHDMyo9b head construct in pUHD to generate pUHDMyo9bhead-insert. A BsiI-BamHI fragment from this construct was used to replace the corresponding fragment in the pBSKMyo9b to generate pBSKMyo9b-insert, which was then subcloned in to pVL1392 as above to generate a transfer vector for full-length Myo9b-insert. To generate the Myo9b mutant lacking the N-terminal extension (Myo9b-extension), a fragment was amplified from Myo9b using the following primers: 5′-CCGGCGGCCGCACCATGGCCCATCATCACCATCACCATCGCCGTGGAGCGAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCG-TTGACTTGGATGAACTTCCC-3′. The former (forward) primer consisted of a NotI site followed by a Kozak sequence, a start codon, and a sequence coding for six histidines followed by the Myo9b sequence starting with the codon for amino acid-134 (Arg). An Eco47III-NotI fragment from this PCR product was used to replace the corresponding fragment from the Myo9b construct in pBSK to generate pBSKMyo9b-extension. This was then subcloned into the XhoI-NotI sites in the Tn7 region of the plasmid pFastbac (Bac to Bac baculovirus expression system, Invitrogen) to generate pFastbacMyo9b-extension. This recombinant plasmid was used to transform competent DH10bac Escherichia coli cells that contain a bacmid with Tn7 attachment sites and a helper plasmid coding for the transposase. Recombinant bacmids were isolated and used to transfect insect cells to generate the recombinant baculovirus containing Myo9b-extension. The cDNA encoding rat calmodulin was obtained by PCR amplification of the cam III gene from rat cortex cDNA with the primers 5′-CGGGATCCCCATGGCTGACCAGCTGA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCACTTCGCAGTCATCAT-3′. It was subcloned in pVL1392 by using the EcoRI and SmaI sites. Recombinant baculoviruses were isolated and amplified as described before (10Müller R.T. Honnert U. Reinhard J. Bähler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2039-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and stored at 4 or -80 °C for further use. Protein Purification—Sf9 cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in Grace's medium with 10% fetal calf serum were coinfected with either rat Myo9b, loop 2 splice variant of rat Myo9bSP2, Myo9b-insert, Myo9b-extension, and calmodulin recombinant baculovirus at a ratio of 1:2 and a multiplicity of infection of 10 for rat Myo9b or 4 for other Myo9b constructs. Sf9 cells were collected after 72 h by centrifugation at 100 × g and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml per 108 cells of cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml Pefabloc, and 7.6 TIU/liter aprotinin) and lysed by sonication. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm (Sorvall SS34) for 30 min, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 45,000 rpm (Ti 70, Beckman) for 45 min. The resulting supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and applied to a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). HiTrap chelating columns were preloaded with 0.1 m NiSO4 and pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mm imidazole. The column was developed with a linear imidazole gradient from 10 to 600 mm. Rat Myo9b eluted approximately at 100-300 mm imidazole. Fractions eluted were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing purified rat myosins were pooled and dialyzed for 2 days against three changes of dialysis buffer (30 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm EGTA). Alternatively, Myo9b/Myo9b-insert was eluted by using the imidazole gradient in a modified lysis buffer (with 50 mm NaCl, without ATP) and was used directly because dialysis in the above-mentioned buffer led to a complete precipitation of the Myo9b-insert protein. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purified rat Myo9b proteins were stored at 4 °C and used within a week. The purity of preparations was analyzed by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels using the Image Master Gel quantification system (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit skeletal actin was prepared as described previously (12Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with pyrene (13Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Calmodulin was bought from Sigma, or it was expressed in bacteria and purified using phenyl-Sepharose (14Putkey J.A. Slaughter G.R. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4704-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady State Mg2+-ATPase Measurements—ATPase assays were performed essentially as described previously (15Stöffler H.E. Bähler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14605-14611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 27 mm KCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) or buffer B (15 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm imidazole, 25 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) when Myo9b proteins were assayed after the elution from the HiTrap column directly. Assays were started by the addition of 2 mm ATP and incubated at 37 °C or at 20 °C for 20-90 min. The Mg2+-ATPase activity was also measured in the presence of an ATP regeneration system consisting of 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. The liberated pyruvate was quantified as described in Reynard et al. (16Reynard A.M. Hass L.F. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the basal and actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity was measured in 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 4 mm dithiothreitol using the coupled-enzyme assay described by Nørby (17Norby J.G. Acta Chem. Scand. 1971; 25: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absorbance at 340 nm was monitored with a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer to detect the conversion of NADH to NAD Myo9b+(molar equivalent to the hydrolysis of ATP). The Myo9b concentration was 0.2-0.5 μm in these assays. Vmax and Kactin values were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten Equation 1, v=((Vm−VB)[actin]/(Kactin+[actin]))+VB(Eq. 1) where VB is the basal Mg2+-ATPase activity of the myosin. Stopped-flow Experiments—Rapid kinetic stopped-flow experiments were carried out at 20 °C in a standard buffer of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 or in 50% imidazole buffer. Pseudo-first order conditions were maintained in all experiments. The fluorescence transients were recorded with a standard Hi-Tech SF-61DX2 stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Fluorescence was excited at 434 (coumarin-ATP) or 365 nm (mant nucleotides and pyrene) using a 75-watt Xe/Hg lamp and a monochromator. Fluorescence emission was monitored through GG455 or KV389 cut-off filters in the case of experiments with coumarin or mant and pyrene fluorescence, respectively. All the transients shown are the average of 3-6 traces of the stopped-flow apparatus. The concentrations used to describe the experimental conditions are those established after mixing the reactants in the stopped-flow apparatus (dilution by 2, 1:1 mixing). Coumarin-ATP (deac-eda-ADP: 3′-O-{N-[2-(7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxamido)ethyl]carbamoyl}ATP) was a gift from Martin Webb (NIMR, Mill Hill London, UK), prepared according to Webb and Corrie (18Webb M.R. Corrie J.E. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1562-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and used according to the method established by Clark et al. (19Clark R.J. Nyitrai M. Webb M.R. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2003; 24: 315-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mant nucleotides were purchased from Molecular Probes. The experimental traces were normalized to the signal level measured in the absence of nucleotides and that level was then taken as 100%. Quenched-flow Experiments—The quenched-flow experiments were carried out with a Hi-Tech RQF-63 using a buffer containing 30 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2,20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. Myo9b (2 μm) was mixed with excess ATP (15 μm) and incubated at 20 °C for desired time intervals (up to 800 s). The reaction was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 6.25% trichloroacetic acid. After neutralization with NaOH and a clarification spin at 3,000 × g for 5 min, the samples were diluted 1:10 with the fast protein liquid chromatography running buffer containing 125 mm KPi, pH 5.5. The separation of ADP and ATP was carried out on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) using a Hypersil ODS (3 μm) column and an isocratic flow. Integration of the peak areas provided the ratio of ADP and ATP at each time point. The ratio of the ADP to the total nucleotide concentration at each given time point was then used to calculate the hydrolysis rate of the myosin. Cosedimentation Experiments—Actin was polymerized in a buffer of 30 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm NaN3 (actin buffer). Actin filaments were stabilized by incubation with a 1:1 or 1:2 molar ratio of phalloidin for 2-4 h. The cosedimentation assays were carried out on ice (4 °C) in a final volume of 100 μl using indicated actin concentrations in actin buffer. When the myosin was used directly after the elution, the assays were carried out in 50% imidazole buffer. Nucleotides and EDTA, wherever indicated, were added to a final concentration of 5 mm. A 10-fold molar excess of exogenous calmodulin was used. Purified rat Myo9b, Myo9b-insert, or Myo9b-extension was added to the assay mixture, and the samples were incubated on ice for 15 min. Supernatants and pellets were obtained after centrifugation in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor at 75,000 rpm for 15 min. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of dialysis buffer and prepared for SDS-PAGE. Equivalent amounts of supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Myosin in the supernatants and pellets was quantified by densitometric analysis using an Imagemaster laser densitometer. Analysis of the Actin Binding Data—For analysis the normalized band intensities of the bound myosin (Snorm) were calculated as the ratio of the myosin band densities in the pellet to the sum of the densities of myosin in the pellet and supernatant (total myosin density). The normalized densities were plotted as a function of total actin concentration ([A]0). The dissociation equilibrium constant (K(N)A) for myosin binding to actin filaments and the fraction of Myo9b that bound to actin (Fmax) at high actin concentrations were determined by fitting to the solution of the following standard quadratic Equation 2, [A]0[M]0−([M]0+[A]0+K(N)A)[A·M]+[A·M]2=0(Eq. 2) where [A·M]=[M]0Snorm. The nomenclature used for the affinities of myosin for actin and nucleotides is described in Scheme 1, where M, A, and N symbolize the myosin (or its fragment), actin, and nucleotide, respectively. The nucleotide was either ADP or ATP in this work, thus N = D or N = T. The affinity of the myosin for actin is characterized by KA in the absence of nucleotide and by KDA or KTA in the presence of ADP or ATP, respectively. The affinity of myosin for ADP or ATP is given by KD and KT in the absence of actin, and by KAD and KAT in the presence of actin, respectively. Expression and Purification of Rat Myosin 9b—Full-length rat Myo9b (previously called myr5) with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was coexpressed with rat calmodulin in Sf9 insect cells. Coinfection of Sf9 cells with calmodulin virus was necessary to obtain soluble Myo9b. Myo9b was affinity-purified over Hi-trap nickel-Sepharose from clarified Sf9 cell extracts (Fig. 1A). Purified rat Myo9b preparations contained the 230-kDa rat Myo9b heavy chain and a protein band comigrating with authentic calmodulin (Fig. 1B). This band showed a mobility shift when run in the presence of Ca2+, a further characteristic of calmodulin (data not shown). Although the stoichiometry of Myo9b heavy chain to calmodulin varied between different preparations, several preparations exhibited a stoichiometry of 1:4 in accordance with the four IQ motifs present in the light chain-binding domain of rat Myo9b. In gel-filtration chromatography, the purified Myo9b eluted as a single-headed molecule (data not shown). Typical preparations from about 4 × 108 cells yielded between 300 μg and 2 mg of rat Myo9b. Similar results were observed with Myo9b-insert lacking the large loop 2 insertion and Myo9b-extension lacking the N-terminal extension (Fig. 1B). The loop 2 splice variant SP2 of Myo9b demonstrated similar steady state ATPase activities to Myo9b and was used in most experiments. Actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase Activity of Myo9b—The Mg2+-ATPase activity data measured at 37 °C are summarized in TABLE ONE. The basal steady state Mg2+-ATPase activity of rat Myo9b in the absence of actin was 0.174 s-1 at 37 °C (0.018 s-1 at 20 °C), and it was substantially activated by actin filaments up to a Vmax of 2.00 ± 0.12 s Myo9b-1 (Fig. 2) (Vmax = 0.23 ± 0.04 s-1 at 20 °C). These results demonstrate that rat Myo9b exhibits biochemical characteristics of a bona fide myosin. The actin concentration at half-saturation of the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity (Kactin) was remarkably low (1.9 ± 0.4 μm) as expected for a processive myosin (Fig. 2). From the data obtained at 20 and 37 °C, the value of Q10 for the Mg2+-ATPase activity was estimated to be 5.7 and 5.1 in the absence or presence of actin, respectively, reflecting strong temperature dependence.TABLE ONEThe Mg2+-ATPase activity of Myo9b, Myo9b-insert, and Myo9b-extension at 37 °C in the absence and presence of actin The errors presented are standard deviations calculated from the results of repeated (n > 3) experiments.BufferBuffer AaBuffer A consists of 30 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4Buffer BbBuffer B consists of 15 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 150 mm imidazole, 25 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanolMyo9bMyo9b–extensionMyo9b–insertMyo9bBasal (s–1)0.174 ± 0.040.160 ± 0.050.10.1Vmax (s–)2.00 ± 0.123.23 ± 0.210.72 ± 0.130.31 ± 0.06Kactin (μm)1.9 ± 0.419 ± 431 ± 920 ± 8a Buffer A consists of 30 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4b Buffer B consists of 15 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 150 mm imidazole, 25 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol Open table in a new tab During prolonged reaction times at 37 °C, the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of rat Myo9b decreased to some extent (by 25% in 60 min). To investigate whether this decrease in activity was because of the accumulated ADP competing with ATP for the nucleotide-binding site, as has been observed for myosin V (20De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we used an ATP-regeneration system to keep the ADP concentration low. The Mg2+-ATPase activity was monitored in the presence of 10 μm actin by measurement of Pi accumulation over time in the absence or presence of the ATP-regeneration system. The time dependence of the liberated Pi or pyruvate values was approximately linear, and their slopes were similar (data not shown), indicating that the Mg2+-ATPase activity of rat Myo9b was not markedly affected by the increasing concentrations of ADP in the assay.

Mant-ADP Binding to and Release from Myo9b—To characterize the interaction of Myo9b with nucleotides, we carried out rapid kinetic experiments. The determined kinetic parameters are presented in TABLE TWO. The rates of ADP association and dissociation for Myo9b were determined by stopped-flow experiments. In some myosins the binding of nucleotide can be monitored by a change in the intrinsic tryptophan signal. However, in rat Myo9b there was no measurable change in the tryptophan emission upon nucleotide binding. Therefore, we used fluorescent analogues, mant-ATP/ADP and coumarin-ATP, to measure the kinetics of nucleotide binding to Myo9b.TABLE TWOThe kinetic parameters characterizing the interaction of Myo9b, Myo9b-insert, and Myo9b-extension with nucleotides at 20 °C For comparison, the table also shows the corresponding data for myosin V and for rabbit skeletal muscle myosin S1.

In this work we showed that the human CTP synthetase genes, CTPS1 and CTPS2, were functional in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and complemented the lethal phenotype of the ura7Δ ura8Δ mutant lacking CTP synthetase activity. The expression of the CTPS1- and CTPS2-encoded human CTP synthetase enzymes in the ura7Δ ura8Δ mutant was shown by immunoblot analysis of CTP synthetase proteins, the measurement of CTP synthetase activity, and the synthesis of CTP in vivo. Phosphoamino acid and phosphopeptide mapping analyses of human CTP synthetase 1 isolated from 32Pi-labeled cells revealed that the enzyme was phosphorylated on multiple serine residues in vivo. Activation of protein kinase A activity in yeast resulted in transient increases (2-fold) in the phosphorylation of human CTP synthetase 1 and the cellular level of CTP. Human CTP synthetase 1 was also phosphorylated by mammalian protein kinase A in vitro. Using human CTP synthetase 1 purified from Escherichia coli as a substrate, protein kinase A activity was dose- and time-dependent, and dependent on the concentrations of CTP synthetase 1 and ATP. These studies showed that S. cerevisiae was useful for the analysis of human CTP synthetase phosphorylation.

Owing to the relatively high degree of deduced amino acid sequence identity (∼53%) between the yeast and human enzymes, we examined the hypothesis that the human CTPS1 and CTPS2 genes are functionally expressed in S. cerevisiae. We showed in this study that the CTPS1 or CTPS2 genes complemented the lethal phenotype of an ura7Δ ura8Δ mutant lacking CTP synthetase. In addition, expression of the CTPS1-encoded human CTP synthetase in yeast revealed that the enzyme was phosphorylated and regulated by protein kinase A. Materials—All chemicals were reagent grade.

Strains and Growth Conditions—The strains used in this work are listed in TABLE ONE. Yeast cells were grown in SC medium containing 2% glucose at 30 °C as described previously (51.Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar, 52.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For selection of cells bearing plasmids, appropriate amino acids were omitted from the SC medium. Cells were also grown in YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or YEPA medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% acetate). Plasmid maintenance and amplifications were performed in E. coli strain DH5α. E. coli cells were grown in LB medium (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to the growth medium for E. coli-carrying plasmids. Media were supplemented with either 2% (yeast) or 1.5% (E. coli) agar for growth on plates. Yeast cell numbers in liquid media were determined spectrophotometrically at A600 nm. For purification of the human CTP synthetase 1 from E. coli, BL21(DE3) cells bearing plasmid pET-28b(+)-hCTPS1 were grown in 6 liters of LB medium at 37 °C to a cell density of A600 = 0.15. The cells were then slowly cooled to 15 °C over a 2-h period until they reached a cell density of A600 = 0.3. At this point, the expression of human CTP synthetase 1 was induced by adding 0.5 mm β-isopropylthioglactoside to the culture. Maximum expression occurred after 16 h at 15 °C. Under these growth conditions, ∼50% of human CTP synthetase 1 protein was in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate.TABLE ONEStrains used in this workStrainRelevant characteristicsSource or Ref.E. coliDH5αF-, ϕ80dlacZΔM15, Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169, deoR, recA1, endA1, hsdR17(rk- mk+), phoA, supE44, l- thi-1, gyrA96, relA1(52.Sambrook J.

Construction of Plasmids—The plasmids used in this work are listed in TABLE TWO. To construct E. coli expression vectors for the human CTP synthetase genes, coding sequences for CTPS1 or CTPS2 were amplified by PCR using cDNA clones (Open Biosystems clones 3355881 and 5268973, respectively) as templates. The forward and reverse primers used in the amplification contained a DraI site and an XhoI site, respectively. Digestion of the PCR products (∼1.8 kb) with DraI and XhoI produced the CTPS1 sequence for codons 2–591 and a linker (Leu-Glu), and the CTPS2 sequence for codons 2–586 and a linker (Leu-Glu). The bacterial expression vector pET-28b(+), which contains the T7 lac promoter, was digested with NcoI, filled with T4 polymerase to provide a start codon, and digested with XhoI to provide the linker. DNA fragments of CTPS1 or CTPS2 were ligated to the linear pET-28b(+) to produce plasmids pET-28b(+)-hCTPS1 or pET-28b(+)-hCTPS2, respectively. The sequences for the human CTPS1 and CTPS2 genes in the bacterial expression vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. These plasmids directed the expression of full-length His6tagged (C terminus) versions of human CTP synthetase 1 or human CTP synthetase 2, respectively, in E. coli.TABLE TWOPlasmids used in this workPlasmidRelevant characteristicsSource or Ref.pET-28b(+)E. coli expression vector with the T7 lac promoter and C-terminal His6-tag fusionNovagenpET-28b(+)-hCTPS1CTPS1 derivative of pET-28b(+)This studypET-28b(+)-hCTPS2CTPS2 derivative of pET-28b(+)This studyYEpLac181Multicopy E. coli/yeast shuttle vector with LEU2(84.Gietz R.D.

Two XbaI/XmnI fragments of similar size were differentiated by EcoRV treatment, which only cleaves the fragment that does not contain CTPS1 or CTPS2 coding sequences. Plasmid pDO105, a yeast expression vector with the ADH1 promoter, was digested with MluI, filled with Klenow, and digested with XbaI.

https://openalex.org/W2003699190,"Pancreatic lipase is a soluble globular protein that must undergo structural modifications before it can hydrolyze oil droplets coated with bile salts. The binding of colipase and movement of the lipase lid open access to the active site. Mechanisms triggering lid mobility are unclear. The *KNILSQIVDIDGI* fragment of the lid of the human pancreatic lipase is predicted by molecular modeling to be a tilted peptide. Tilted peptides are hydrophobicity motifs involved in membrane fusion and more globally in perturbations of hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces. Analysis of this lid fragment predicts no clear consensus of secondary structure that suggests that its structure is not strongly sequence determined and could vary with environment. Point mutations were designed to modify the hydrophobicity profile of the [240–252] fragment and their consequences on the lipase-mediated catalysis were tested. Two mutants, in which the tilted peptide motif was lost, also have poor activity on bile salt-coated oil droplets and cannot be reactivated by colipase. Conversely, one mutant in which a different tilted peptide is created retains colipase dependence. These results suggest that the tilted hydrophobicity pattern of the [240–252] fragment is neither important for colipase binding to lipase, nor for interfacial binding but is important to trigger the maximal catalytic efficiency of lipase in the presence of bile salt."
