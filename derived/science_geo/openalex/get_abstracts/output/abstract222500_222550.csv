https://openalex.org/W2097933346,"MDM2 binds the p53 tumor suppressor protein with high affinity and negatively modulates its transcriptional activity and stability. Overexpression of MDM2, found in many human tumors, effectively impairs p53 function. Inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction can stabilize p53 and may offer a novel strategy for cancer therapy. Here, we identify potent and selective small-molecule antagonists of MDM2 and confirm their mode of action through the crystal structures of complexes. These compounds bind MDM2 in the p53-binding pocket and activate the p53 pathway in cancer cells, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and growth inhibition of human tumor xenografts in nude mice."

https://openalex.org/W2113019448,"To initiate studies on how protein-protein interaction (or “interactome”) networks relate to multicellular functions, we have mapped a large fraction of the Caenorhabditis elegans interactome network. Starting with a subset of metazoan-specific proteins, more than 4000 interactions were identified from high-throughput, yeast two-hybrid (HT=Y2H) screens. Independent coaffinity purification assays experimentally validated the overall quality of this Y2H data set. Together with already described Y2H interactions and interologs predicted in silico , the current version of the Worm Interactome (WI5) map contains ∼5500 interactions. Topological and biological features of this interactome network, as well as its integration with phenome and transcriptome data sets, lead to numerous biological hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W2040234712,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a widespread silencing mechanism that acts at both the posttranscriptional and transcriptional levels. Here, we describe the purification of an RNAi effector complex termed RITS (RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing) that is required for heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast. The RITS complex contains Ago1 (the fission yeast Argonaute homolog), Chp1 (a heterochromatin-associated chromodomain protein), and Tas3 (a novel protein). In addition, the complex contains small RNAs that require the Dicer ribonuclease for their production. These small RNAs are homologous to centromeric repeats and are required for the localization of RITS to heterochromatic domains. The results suggest a mechanism for the role of the RNAi machinery and small RNAs in targeting of heterochromatin complexes and epigenetic gene silencing at specific chromosomal loci."

https://openalex.org/W2093560200,"Rhodopseudomonas palustris is among the most metabolically versatile bacteria known. It uses light, inorganic compounds, or organic compounds, for energy. It acquires carbon from many types of green plant-derived compounds or by carbon dioxide fixation, and it fixes nitrogen. Here we describe the genome sequence of R. palustris, which consists of a 5,459,213-base-pair (bp) circular chromosome with 4,836 predicted genes and a plasmid of 8,427 bp. The sequence reveals genes that confer a remarkably large number of options within a given type of metabolism, including three nitrogenases, five benzene ring cleavage pathways and four light harvesting 2 systems. R. palustris encodes 63 signal transduction histidine kinases and 79 response regulator receiver domains. Almost 15% of the genome is devoted to transport. This genome sequence is a starting point to use R. palustris as a model to explore how organisms integrate metabolic modules in response to environmental perturbations."

We evaluated the contribution of fires from different continents to variability in these greenhouse gases from 1997 to 2001, using satellite-based estimates of fire activity, biogeochemical modeling, and an inverse analysis of atmospheric CO anomalies. During the 1997 to 1998 El Niño, the fire emissions anomaly was 2.1 ± 0.8 petagrams of carbon, or 66 ± 24% of the CO 2 growth rate anomaly. The main contributors were Southeast Asia (60%), Central and South America (30%), and boreal regions of Eurasia and North America (10%)."

https://openalex.org/W2041251646,"Interactions between ends from different DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can produce tumorigenic chromosome translocations. Two theories for the juxta-position of DSBs in translocations, the static ""contact-first"" and the dynamic ""breakage-first"" theory, differ fundamentally in their requirement for DSB mobility. To determine whether or not DSB-containing chromosome domains are mobile and can interact, we introduced linear tracks of DSBs in nuclei. We observed changes in track morphology within minutes after DSB induction, indicating movement of the domains. In a subpopulation of cells, the domains clustered. Juxtaposition of different DSB-containing chromosome domains through clustering, which was most extensive in G1 phase cells, suggests an adhesion process in which we implicate the Mre11 complex. Our results support the breakage-first theory to explain the origin of chromosomal translocations."
https://openalex.org/W1994745273,"A previously unknown maltose transporter is essential for the conversion of starch to sucrose in Arabidopsis leaves at night. The transporter was identified by isolating two allelic mutants with high starch levels and very high maltose, an intermediate of starch breakdown. The mutations affect a gene of previously unknown function, MEX1 . We show that MEX1is a maltose transporter that is unrelated to other sugar transporters. The severe mex1 phenotype demonstrates that MEX1is the predominant route of carbohydrate export from chloroplasts at night. Homologous genes in plants including rice and potato indicate that maltose export is of widespread significance."

This structure addresses how ""AdoMet radical"" or ""radical SAM"" enzymes use Fe4S4 clusters and S-adenosyl-L-methionine to generate organic radicals. Biotin synthase catalyzes the radical-mediated insertion of sulfur into dethiobiotin to form biotin. The structure places the substrates between the Fe4S4 cluster, essential for radical generation, and the Fe2S2 cluster, postulated to be the source of sulfur, with both clusters in unprecedented coordination environments."
https://openalex.org/W1974875045,"During mammalian cerebral corticogenesis, progenitor cells become progressively restricted in the types of neurons they can produce. The molecular mechanism that determines earlier versus later born neuron fate is unknown. We demonstrate here that the generation of the earliest born neurons, the Cajal-Retzius cells, is suppressed by the telencephalic transcription factor Foxg1. In Foxg1 null mutants, we observed an excess of Cajal-Retzius neuron production in the cortex. By conditionally inactivating Foxg1 in cortical progenitors that normally produce deep-layer cortical neurons, we demonstrate that Foxg1 is constitutively required to suppress Cajal-Retzius cell fate. Hence, the competence to generate the earliest born neurons during later cortical development is actively suppressed but not lost."

We identified the Galactic habitable zone (GHZ) as an annular region between 7 and 9 kiloparsecs from the Galactic center that widens with time and is composed of stars that formed between 8 and 4 billion years ago. This GHZ yields an age distribution for the complex life that may inhabit our Galaxy. We found that 75% of the stars in the GHZ are older than the Sun."

https://openalex.org/W1992249022,"Meiotic gene conversion has an important role in allele diversification and in the homogenization of gene and other repeat DNA sequence families, sometimes with pathological consequences. But little is known about the dynamics of gene conversion in humans and its relationship to meiotic crossover. We therefore developed screening and selection methods to characterize sperm conversions in two meiotic crossover hot spots in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and one in the sex chromosomal pseudoautosomal pairing region PAR1 (ref. 9). All three hot spots are active in gene conversion and crossover. Conversion tracts are short and define a steep bidirectional gradient centered at the peak of crossover activity, consistent with crossovers and conversions being produced by the same recombination-initiating events. These initiations seem to be spread over a narrow zone, rather than occurring at a single site, and seem preferentially to yield conversions rather than crossovers. Crossover breakpoints are more broadly diffused than conversion breakpoints, suggesting either differences between conversion and crossover processing after initiation or the existence of a quality control checkpoint at which short interactions between homologous chromosomes are preferentially aborted as conversions."
https://openalex.org/W1978905053,"Explaining the energetics of walking and running has been difficult because the distribution of energy use among individual muscles has not been known. We estimated energy use by measuring blood flow to the hindlimb muscles in guinea fowl. Blood flow to skeletal muscles is controlled locally and varies directly with metabolic rate. We estimate that the swing-phase muscles consume 26% of the energy used by the limbs and the stance-phase muscles consume the remaining 74%, independent of speed. Thus, contrary to some previous suggestions, swinging the limbs requires an appreciable fraction of the energy used during terrestrial legged locomotion. Models integrating the energetics and mechanics of running will benefit from more detailed information on the distribution of energy use by the muscles."

Treatment of differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes with an agonist of proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, the putative “master regulator” of adipocyte differentiation, significantly augmented perilipin gene expression.

Adipocytes are the major reservoir of energy stored in the form of triacylglycerol in the body. Triacylglycerol is stored within intracellular lipid droplets covered by a monolayer of phospholipids, free cholesterol, and proteins. In times of energy need, for example, as brought about by activities such as fasting and/or exercise, catecholamines rapidly activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PPRE, PPAR-responsive element.1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PPRE, PPAR-responsive element. resulting in hydrolysis of triacylglycerol as catalyzed by activated hormone-sensitive lipase. The perilipins are a class of proteins found exclusively at the surface of lipid droplets in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells (1Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J.

Upon chatecholamine stimulation, however, perilipins are hyperphosphorylated by PKA, and this hyperphosphorylation has been suggested to facilitate lipase access to lipid droplets (5Souza S.C.

When fed a high fat diet, these mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, in sharp contrast to normal mice. It has also been shown that in the absence of perilipin, the lipid droplets in adipose cells become coated with adipose differentiation-related protein, which is not phosphorylated by PKA, indicating that this related protein is not substitutable for perilipin as a protective barrier against lipolysis (8Tansey J.T. Sztalrd C. Grui-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6494-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopic expression of perilipin in 3T3-L1 cells resulted in lipid droplets becoming perilipin-coated and increased the half-life of stored triacylglycerol deposits (9Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B.

These findings indicate that perilipins are required to maximize the storage of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue and serve the additional crucial function of controlling their release at times of energy demand.Multiple perilipin isoforms are encoded by a single copy of a gene that gives rise to multiple mRNAs by alternative splicing mechanisms (2Greenberg A.S.

The 5′ end segments of the mRNAs of all of these isoforms are identical; therefore they are highly likely to be transcribed from the same promoter on the perilipin gene. In the present study, we undertook the characterization of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse perilipin gene and examined how it is expressed exclusively in adipocytes, its apparently exclusive site of activity. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with an agonist for PPARγ, typically regarded as “a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation,” stimulates perilipin gene expression. Reporter assays reveal that the 5′-flanking region of the gene contains a functional PPARγ-responsive element and that PPARγ2, an isoform exclusively expressed in adipocytes, is a predominant regulator of the expression of this gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Pioglitazone was a kind gift from Takeda Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan).

Oligonucleotide primers composed of the following sequences (upstream and down stream) were used for PCR: perilipin, 5′-CAAGACCTCTGCTCTCCTG-3′ and 5′-CTAAAGGGCAGCCTGCTTC-3′ (253 bp); and aP2, 5′-GAATTCCAGCAGGAATCAGG-3 and 5′-GCCAAAGAGACAGAGGGCG-3′ (300 bp).Lipid Analysis—3T3-L1 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lipids were extracted by chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The lower organic phase was dried, and the lipids were dissolved in 2-propanol. Triacylglycerol content was determined using Triglyceride E-test Wako (Wako, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Western Blot Analysis—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into adipocytes by the addition of differentiation medium containing 10 μm pioglitazone at day 0 and were cultured for 4 days. Total cellular proteins were fractionated by SDS-10% PAGE. Western blot analysis was carried out using anti-human perilipin or anti-mouse β-actin antibodies with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The signals on the membrane were quantified with a LuminoImager (LAS-3000; Fuji Film Inc.).RESULTSA PPARγ Ligand Enhances Perilipin Gene Expression in Adipocytes—Fig. 1A shows that perilipin gene expression was low to almost the zero point level in preadipocytes but was induced markedly at later stages of differentiation. This perilipin expression pattern was quite similar to those for PPARγ, known to be a central regulator of adipocyte differentiation (18Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spigelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), and aP2, a target gene of PPARγ. Therefore, we hypothesized that PPARγ participates in the induced expression of the perilipin gene during differentiation. As expected, treatment of 3T3-L1 cells for 48 h with a PPARγ agonist, pioglitazone, raised expression of the mRNA for perilipin and LPL, another PPARγ gene target (20Schoonjans K. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Lefebvre A.M. Heyman R.A. Briggs M. Deeb S. Staels B. Auwerx J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5336-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), but only in adipocytes (Fig. 1B). This suggests that PPARγ, which is highly expressed after adipocyte differentiation, is involved in perilipin gene expression.When pioglitazone was added to the culture medium at an early stage of differentiation, the enhancing effect of the drug was significant (Fig. 2, day 2). In contrast, as a result of treatment of the cells with a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, perilipin gene expression was inhibited for 4 days. Because a longer treatment with pioglitazone gradually suppressed PPARγ gene expression (21Camp H.S. Whitton A.L. Tafuri S.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 186: 186-190Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the maximal drug effect was observed at day 2, and no effect was seen after day 6 (data not shown). Fig. 2B clearly shows that the perilipin protein level was significantly increased by treatment with pioglitazone on day 4. The increase in perilipin expression resulted in the higher intracellular accumulation of triacylglycerol (Fig. 2C), consistent with the finding of an increased number of lipid droplets in the cells in the presence of pioglitazone (data not shown).Fig. 2Effect of pioglitazoneduring 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. A, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into adipocytes by the addition of a differentiation medium containing 10 μm pioglitazone (PGZ) or 10 μm GW9662 at day 0 and were cultured for 2 or 4 days. Total RNA (20 μg/lane) was subjected to electrophoresis and blot hybridization with the indicated 32P-labeled probe. B, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into adipocytes by the addition of differentiation medium containing 10 μm pioglitazone at day 0 and were cultured for 4 days. Aliquots of total cellular proteins (20 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-perilipin and anti-β-actin antibodies. The results were normalized to the signal generated from β-actin. C, cellular lipids were extracted at the indicated times after treatment with a differentiation medium containing 10 μm pioglitazone, and the triacylglycerol (TG) contents were quantified. The data are shown as the means ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PPARγ Directly Regulates the Transcription of the Perilipin Gene—To determine whether PPARγ directly regulates the transcription of the perilipin gene, we carried out luciferase assays with reporter genes, including various deletion versions of the mouse perilipin 5′-flanking region (Fig. 3A). 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and HEK293 cells were co-transfected with one of the reporter genes and expression plasmids for PPARγ2 and RXRα. The cells were treated with pioglitazone for the last 24 h. Fig. 3B clearly shows that forced expression of PPARγ in both adipogenic and nonadipogenic cells enhanced the luciferase activities ∼40-fold as long as the reporter gene containing the segment around –2.0-kb was present (the transcription start site is position +1). Deletion of ∼100 and ∼300 bp (pPlin-1.9 and pPlin-1.7, respectively) dramatically reduced this effect. We obtained the same results using nonmammalian cells, Drosophila SL2 cells (data not shown). It is likely that the 5- and 10-fold induction of the promoter activity of pPlin-1.9 observed in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and HEK293 cells, respectively, is largely attributable to overexpression of PPARγ2 and RXRα. We cannot rule out the possibility that the 1.9-kb promoter contains several weak PPARγ responsive elements. The luciferase activities of pPlin-2.0 were greatly stimulated only when both PPARγ2 and RXRα were expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells in the presence of the agonist (Fig. 3C). When only RXRα was expressed, no effect was observed, suggesting that the pioglitazone-mediated effect is not caused by a combination of RXR and some nuclear receptors, other than PPARγ. The luciferase activities of pPlin-1.9 were slightly augmented by PPARγ2/RXRα. Next we performed further luciferase assays using pPlin-2.0 and pPlin-1.9 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Endogenous PPARγ activated by pioglitazone markedly enhanced the luciferase activities of pPlin-2.0, whereas deletion of ∼100 bp completely abolished this effect (Fig. 3D). Even when PPARγ2/RXRα were overexpressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the Plin-1.9 promoter did not respond to pioglitazone. These results demonstrate that the 5′-flanking region of mouse peripilin gene contains PPRE(s), which responds to endogenous PPARγ, located in a region of approximately –2.0-kb.Fig. 3Activation of the perilipin promoter by PPARγ2.

To confirm that these motifs are recognized by a PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer, gel mobility shift assays were performed with recombinant PPARγ/RXRα. A single-shifted DNA-protein complex was observed in the presence of a control 32P-labeled fragment corresponding to the PPRE of the aP2 gene and recombinant PPARγ/RXRα (Fig. 4A, lane 2) and gradually disappeared after the addition of increasing amounts of the nonlabeled PPRE DNA fragment but not the PPRE-like fragment. Fig. 4B shows that a single-shifted perilipin PPRE-PPARγ/RXRα complex was formed (lane 2). The band almost completely disappeared in the presence of an excess amount of an unlabeled wild type fragment but not a mutant fragment (lanes 3–6). These results clearly demonstrate that PPARγ is capable of binding to the TCACCTTTCACCC sequence in the perilipin promoter. As shown in Fig. 4C, the identical two repeats in the PPRE are conserved in the promoters of both the mouse and human genes. To determine whether this PPRE is involved in the PPARγ-mediated regulation of perilipin gene expression, luciferase assays using wild type and mutant versions of reporter genes were carried out. Mutation of the PPRE sequence (–1977 to –1983 bp) resulted in a remarkable suppression of the PPARγ-dependent induction of luciferase activities in preadipocyte cells (Fig. 4D). These results provide evidence that the PPRE motif (–1974 to –1986 bp) is crucially responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the perilipin gene during adipocyte differentiation.Fig. 4A PPARγ-RXRαcomplex binds to the PPRE in the perilipin promoter and regulates the gene expression.

Two Hsp70s, Lhs1p and Kar2p, are required for protein biogenesis in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we found that Lhs1p and Kar2p specifically interacted to couple, and coordinately regulate, their respective activities. Lhs1p stimulated Kar2p by providing a specific nucleotide exchange activity, whereas Kar2p reciprocally activated the Lhs1p adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase).

Here we describe a technology called enzymatic production of RNAi library (EPRIL) by which cDNAs are converted by a sequence of enzymatic treatments into an RNAi library consisting of a vast array of different shRNA expression constructs. We applied EPRIL to a single cDNA source and prepared an RNAi library consisting of shRNA constructs with various RNAi efficiencies. High-throughput screening allowed us to rapidly identify the best shRNA constructs from the library. We also describe a new selection scheme using the thymidine kinase gene for obtaining efficient shRNA constructs. Furthermore, we show that EPRIL can be applied to constructing an RNAi library from a cDNA library, providing a basis for future whole-genome phenotypic screening of genes."

Biol. 2000; 130: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). It is the main constituent in the deposits that form in the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas in type 2 diabetes mellitus (2Clark A. Cooper G.J. Lewis C.E. Morris J.F. Willis A.C. Reid K.B.

The deposits in this disease correlate with the depletion of islet β-cells and are considered a hallmark feature of disease progression. Amylin, a 37-amino-acid peptide, is produced in the islet β-cells and cosecreted with insulin.

Sweimeh K. Brunner H. Voelter W. Kapurniotu A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) described a partially folded population of hA molecules that, with its self-associated forms, may act as an early, soluble precursor of β-sheet and in amyloid fibril formation. This partially folded state has been characterized as adopting a higher content of secondary structure and as having fluctuating tertiary and quaternary aromatic interactions and solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches. Their data support a nucleation-dependent process with a distinctive lag time for hA fibril formation. Other researchers have also proposed a nucleation-dependent aggregation mechanism (26Rhoades E. Agarwal J. Gafni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Padrick S.B. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), which differs from the former in that it postulates the existence of a reservoir, which maintains a constant concentration of soluble monomeric peptide. Padrick and Miranker (27Padrick S.B. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) extended this proposal by suggesting that hA fibril formation occurs via a double-nucleation mechanism. This includes the formation of nuclei (primary nucleation) that then elongate followed by a further step, which is fibril-dependent (secondary nucleation). One of the proposed mechanisms by which this occurs is by “templated nucleation” using a nongrowing surface of a fibril. This secondary nucleation may be insignificant initially but becomes important once fibrils accumulate. Time-lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to trace hA fibril formation in real time, identifying a putative hA protofibril and observing that it grew bidirectionally with a speed of 1.1 nm/min under the conditions used (28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The protofibril was proposed to be a “building block” of the thicker higher-order mature fibrils (24Goldsbury C.S. Cooper G.J. Goldie K.N. Muller S.A. Saafi E.L. Gruijters W.T. Misur M.P. Engel A. Aebi U. Kistler J. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), which were thought to form by lateral association of protofibrils. However, such side-by-side association of protofibrils has never been directly observed. Mature fibrils with frayed ends, which would support the notion of a lateral association of protofibrils, were not observed. An open question therefore remains about the nature of the assembly mechanism of the mature higher order hA fibrils. Specifically, do they assemble by lateral association of long preformed protofibrils, or do they form by longitudinal growth of full-width structures? Our new data point to the latter as the more likely scenario. We first illustrate how the pretreatment of lyophilized hA with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-isopropanol (HFIP) produces an initial solution of small oligomeric structures, which can be observed by AFM. By time-lapse imaging, we were able to show that these oligomers first increase in height before elongating into mature fibrils. Congo red partially inhibits the height increase of the oligomers and fully inhibits elongation into fibrils, also supporting the notion of a two-step assembly process. Our observations thus reveal an important new aspect, which needs to be considered in the light of increasing evidence that some distinct oligomeric intermediates rather than the mature fibrils are the cytotoxic agent. Peptide Synthesis and Preparation—Lyophilized preparations of synthetic hA (lot numbers 514905, 538994) and rA (lot number 542554) were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Purity was checked by high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Amylin stock solutions were prepared by weighing out the appropriate amount of lyophilized peptide and solubilizing it in HFIP (Fluka) for 1–2 days. The stock solutions of amylin in HFIP were prepared in the concentration range of 0.5–3.2 mm as per BCA assay. At the start of each experiment, amylin HFIP solutions were diluted into buffer, or the HFIP was evaporated off under a nitrogen flow and the amylin was dissolved in water. Atomic Force Microscopy—For the visualization of hA oligomers at specified time points, a fresh solution was prepared (10 μm amylin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.25% HFIP) and added to freshly cleaved mica. After adsorption for 30–120 s, the sample was washed three times with water and imaged under water. For time-lapse AFM, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, alone was scanned initially to check for the presence of any contaminants. Freshly made amylin solutions were injected into the fluid cell to produce a final concentration of 5–10 μm (0–1.25% HFIP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Congo red was added to hA in water, just prior to the addition of buffer and injection into the AFM fluid cell (8 μm hA, 240 μm or 2.4 mm Congo red, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Congo red solutions were freshly prepared in water and filtered three times. Images were obtained with a Nanoscope IIIa multimode scanning probe work station (Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA) operating in tapping mode using a silicon nitride cantilever with a spring constant of 0.32 n/m. All imaging was performed at scan rates of 1.97 Hz using a cantilever drive frequency of 8–9 kHz. All images were captured as 512 × 512 pixel scans and were low-pass filtered. Heights and lengths of oligomers and fibrils were generally measured using the single particle analysis software (Veeco Nanoscope software version 5.12). In the case of time-lapse AFM experiments, fibril and oligomer lengths used to estimate the mass of the oligomers were measured using the sectioning tool (Veeco Nanoscope software version 5.12). Treating the hA oligomers as a partial sphere, the molecular volume was estimated by using the height and lengths, at half-maximal height as described previously (29Schneider S.W. Larmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The number of monomers in the oligomers was deduced by dividing the volume of the hA oligomers by the calculated molecular volume for a hA monomer (29Schneider S.W. Larmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the mass of the oligomers was estimated by dividing the height of the oligomers by 6.9 nm, multiplying by 20 kDa/nm and the length of the oligomer, measured at half-maximal height since the mass-per-length of 6.9 nm high fibrils was determined previously by scanning transmission electron microscopy to be 20 kDa/nm (24Goldsbury C.S. Cooper G.J. Goldie K.N. Muller S.A. Saafi E.L. Gruijters W.T. Misur M.P. Engel A. Aebi U. Kistler J. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Goldsbury C.

Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) Dissolves Preformed Structures and Synchronizes Assembly of hA Oligomers and Fibrils—To examine the early stages of hA fibril assembly, we had to assure ourselves that the stock solution, when diluted into water/buffer at the start of an experiment, did not contain preformed fibrils or assembly intermediates. When hA was dissolved in water and injected into the fluid cell of the AFM filled with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, structures of 90–500 nm in length and 7–20 nm in height appeared on the mica surface within 4–20 min (Fig. 1a, 4-min time point). The structures were polymorphic, representing a heterogeneous mixture of various lengths of fibrils and different sized oligomers. This suggested the presence of preformed structures in the lyophilized stock of hA. The time-lapse AFM experiment revealed that fibrils ranging from about 4 to 6 nm in height, started to grow out of these preformed fibril seeds within the next 20–30 min, elongating further over the next 3 h (Fig. 1a, 44-, 95-, and 237-min time points). To render the starting preparation more homogeneous, we initially dissolved lyophilized hA in HFIP before injection into the buffer-filled fluid cell of the AFM. With this pretreatment, the initial oligomers that appeared were much smaller in height, i.e. ranging from 0.7 to 3.6 nm, in comparison with those that formed when the peptide was dissolved in water (Fig. 1b, 18-min time point). The oligomers were initially 9–65 nm in length and elongated into mature fibrils over the next 30–60 min (Fig. 1b, 35- and 48-min time points). In comparison with the polymorphic fibrils formed from hA stock directly dissolved in water (Fig. 1a), following pretreatment with HFIP, fibrils were generally shorter and more numerous (Fig. 1b, 27-min time point). As expected, rA did not form fibrils under the same conditions, and no oligomeric structures were observed even after 3.5 h of imaging (data not shown). In all of the following experiments, we therefore dissolved hA initially in HFIP, as this enabled the smallest structure intermediates to be imaged in a more reproducible fashion. Growth of Oligomer Precedes Fibril Elongation—Two kinds of experiments were performed to capture the early phases of hA fibril assembly. First, we let assembly begin in a drop of freshly diluted hA on a mica surface. Oligomers and fibrils were free to assemble in the bulk of the solution and adsorb to the mica at any time. Assembly intermediates were trapped at 30, 60, or 120 s by removing the bulk solution and washing the mica surface with water to remove all non-adsorbed structures and soluble hA. The mica was then imaged under water by tapping mode AFM (Fig. 2). After 30 s, small round oligomeric structures were predominant that had an average height of 2.3 ± 1.9 nm and length of 23 ± 14 nm (n = 166) (Fig. 2a). Oligomers were also observed in the samples that had been incubated for 60 s; however, their height was 4.6 ± 2.1 nm, and their length was 47 ± 28 nm (n = 160) (Fig. 2b). The number of oligomers increased with the time of adsorption, and short fibrils were observed occasionally after 60 s incubation. In samples that had been allowed 120 s for assembly and adsorption, typical hA fibrils were formed (Fig. 2c). Measurements of their heights and lengths were 10.6 ± 7.8 nm and 203 ± 170.0 nm, respectively (n = 198). The height and length measurements obtained from all three time points were significantly different from each other (p < 0.0001). This first series of experiments shows that a significant increase in oligomer size occurs before fibrils visibly elongate. This initial enlargement is evident as a doubling of height and length of the oligomer. The height roughly doubles again upon elongation to fibrils. This is distinct from a scenario where protofibrils elongate and subsequently associate laterally to form thicker fibrils (24Goldsbury C.S. Cooper G.J. Goldie K.N. Muller S.A. Saafi E.L. Gruijters W.T. Misur M.P. Engel A. Aebi U. Kistler J. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Time-lapse AFM Quantifies Oligomer Growth—To confirm that the oligomers grew in height before elongating into fibrils, a second kind of experiment was performed. We used timelapse AFM to watch hA fibrils form in real time. For this, the fluid cell of the AFM was first filled with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the mica surface was examined for the presence of any contaminants. An equal volume of freshly diluted hA was then injected into the fluid cell, and the appearance and growth of hA structures on the mica surface were monitored by repeated scanning. Oligomers with heights between 0.7 and 3.6 nm formed on the mica surface within 4–10 min and elongated into fibrils during the next 40–50 min (Fig. 3a). When the height versus length was plotted for individual structures under this assembly regime, it became evident that significant height increases occurred early on in most cases, often before a substantial increase in length (Fig. 3, a and b). When all the heights and lengths from the time-lapse AFM experiments were graphed together, a pattern emerged whereby the oligomers increased in height first, and only when they reached about 6 nm in height did they start to significantly elongate (Fig. 3c). This pattern only emerged clearly when averaging many structures and was less obvious when studying individual structures (Fig. 3b), probably due to the time required to record each picture frame (4 min). In conclusion, both kinds of experiments clearly demonstrate that hA oligomers grow in height before they visibly elongate into fibrils. On average, the height increases from an initial 2 nm to about 6 nm before significant elongation starts (Fig. 3c). A further increase in height to 8–10 nm occurs concomitantly with elongation. Congo Red Allows hA Oligomer Growth but Inhibits Elongation into Fibrils—Congo red is known to interfere with hA fibril formation (30Aitken J.F. Loomes K.M. Konarkowska B. Cooper G.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In light of our data, which have distinguished an initial phase of oligomer growth from a secondary phase of elongation into fibrils, it was of interest to determine at what stage Congo red intervened. For this, we used time-lapse AFM. Again, without the compound, hA formed oligomers within 4–10 min after injection, which elongated into mature fibrils covering much of the mica surface during the next 40–50 min (Fig. 4a). The fibrils that formed after 40–50 min were on average 11.5 ± 4.7 nm in height and 224.9 ± 168.7 nm in length (n = 227) (Fig. 4c). In contrast, hA, to which a 30× molar excess of Congo red had been added, prior to the addition of buffer and injection into the fluid cell of the AFM, formed oligomers within 4–10 min on the mica surface, which did not elongate over time (Fig. 4, b and e). After 90 min of imaging, the oligomers grew to an average height of 3.74 ± 1.1 nm and length of 50.6 ± 26.5 nm (n = 348) (Fig. 4d). Only very few fibrils formed in the presence of the compound. Congo red on its own, at equivalent concentrations, did not produce any precipitates on the mica surface that could have been misinterpreted as hA oligomers even after extensive imaging (data not shown). It appears that Congo red completely prevents the elongation of the oligomers into fibrils. However, in the presence of the inhibitor, the oligomers were still capable of increasing laterally to a height of 3.74 nm, in comparison with the oligomers formed on a mica surface after 30 s, which had a height of only 2.3 nm. These data lend further support to our novel finding that hA fibrillogenesis follows two distinct phases: oligomer growth and elongation into fibrils. The Number of hA Molecules in the Oligomers Can Be Estimated from AFM Data—Dimensions recorded by AFM can be used to crudely estimate the mass of protein assemblies or oligomers (29Schneider S.W. Larmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and therefore, the number of protein molecules per structure. We used the height and length data recorded from hA oligomers to calculate their molecular volume (29Schneider S.W. Larmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The number of hA molecules was deduced by dividing the volume for the oligomers by the calculated volume for an hA monomer. Using the data from the time-lapse AFM experiments (Figs. 1b and 4a), oligomers of <4 nm in height had an estimated mass of 330 ± 140 hA monomers (n = 29). The smallest oligomers, which had a height <2 nm, were estimated to contain 67 ± 28.5 (n = 5) hA molecules. Alternatively, using the data from the timed adsorption experiments (Fig. 2a), oligomers with heights of approximately <2 nm or 2–4 nm were composed of 19 ± 10 (n = 60) and 63 ± 36 (n = 22) hA molecules, respectively. The latter set of estimates was considered more reliable as it was based on larger particle numbers but was probably still inaccurate because the protein density used to calculate the mass was for globular proteins. Therefore, an alternative estimate was also made using the mass density derived from previous scanning transmission electron microscopy mass-per-length measurements. The predominant hA fibril type with a 25 nm periodicity had a mass-per-length value of ∼20 kDa/nm and a height of 6.9 nm (24Goldsbury C.S. Cooper G.J. Goldie K.N. Muller S.A. Saafi E.L. Gruijters W.T. Misur M.P. Engel A. Aebi U. Kistler J. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Assuming that hA oligomers had a packing density similar to this fibril, we estimated the oligomer mass by dividing the height of the oligomers by 6.9 nm and multiplying by the length of the oligomer and the mass-per-length value of 20 kDa/nm. Applying this to the data from the timed adsorption experiments, oligomers <2 nm or 2–4 nm in height were estimated to contain 16 ± 4.6 and 40 ± 14.5 hA molecules, respectively. We consider these as the most accurate estimates for the molecular size of hA oligomers at this stage. Amylin has been known for some time to be the principal molecular constituent of the amyloid deposits that form in the pancreas of patients with type 2 diabetes. Yet the mechanism of amyloid formation by amylin and its role in disease progression have remained poorly understood. Increasing evidence points to oligomeric intermediates rather than the mature fibrils as the cytotoxic agents (18Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3698) Google Scholar, 31Butler A.E. Janson J. Soeller W.C. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 32Janson J. Ashley R.H. Harrison D. McIntyre S. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Our in vitro assembly experiments with synthetic amylin reveal, for the first time, two distinct phases of fibril formation: oligomer growth followed by fibril elongation. The smallest oligomers visualized may contain as few as 16 hA molecules. They have a height of about 2 nm and a length of 23 nm, and they grow to about 6 nm in height before visibly elongating into fibrils. Based on these data and the data of others, we propose a model for the assembly of hA fibrils (Fig. 5) (25Kayed R. Bernhagen J. Greenfield N. Sweimeh K. Brunner H. Voelter W. Kapurniotu A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Monomeric, soluble hA exists in a predominantly random coil conformation in solution (25Kayed R. Bernhagen J. Greenfield N. Sweimeh K. Brunner H. Voelter W. Kapurniotu A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 33Goldsbury C. Goldie K. Pellaud J. Seelig J. Frey P. Muller S.A. Kistler J. Cooper G.J. Aebi U. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). On acquiring secondary structure (a mixture of α- and β-structure), amylin begins to assemble into fibrils (33Goldsbury C. Goldie K. Pellaud J. Seelig J. Frey P. Muller S.A. Kistler J. Cooper G.J. Aebi U. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Initially, oligomeric structures form, and upon reaching a critical size, they act as nuclei for fibril elongation. Although this critical size appears to be about 6 nm in height, oligomers may also grow larger concomitantly with elongation, leading to fibrils 8–10 nm high and giving rise to the previously observed fibril polymorphisms. Time-lapse AFM represents a powerful tool to directly follow the growth of individual fibrils (28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The original time-lapse AFM work performed by Goldsbury et al. (28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) revealed growth of both the 2.4-nm protofibril and a variety of thicker fibrils. The latter were the first to appear, whereas the protofibrils only appeared after a lag phase of approximately 2 h, when hA concentrations were likely to be significantly reduced. Protofibrils did not feature in our present experiments, which focused on the first 2 h only. We can confirm, therefore, that the thicker fibrils represent the primary product, which, in turn, implies that substantial growth of hA oligomers or nuclei precedes fibril assembly. We have been able to image hA oligomers by time-lapse AFM because of the use of HFIP, which was able to dissolve fibril seeds in stock solutions. We estimated the mass of the smallest hA oligomers, observed by AFM, to be composed of 16 monomers. This size of the smallest hA oligomers is similar to mass estimates for other amyloid oligomers reported in the literature. For example, a fibril aggregation unit was described in the case of recombinant amyloidogenic light chain variable domain, SMA, and was reported to consist of 20–24 monomers (34Zhu M. Souillac P.O. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Carter S.A. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50914-50922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Further, in the case of amyloid β-peptide, a micelle spherocylinder was described consisting of 30 monomers (35Yong W. Lomakin A. Kirkitadze M.D. Teplow D.B. Chen S.H. Benedek G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and in the case of phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), an oligomer was reported consisting of 10 monomers (36Modler A.J. Gast K. Lutsch G. Damaschun G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The smallest oligomers that we were able to image averaged 2.3 nm in height. Interestingly, this height is close to the 2.4 nm height of the previously described hA protofibrils (28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This remarkable consistency suggests that the 2.4 nm protofibril, which has so far only been observed as a secondary phenomenon by AFM, i.e. when fibril growth was confined to a mica surface, in fact represents the thinnest possible hA fibril. As outlined above, hA oligomers tend to grow to form full-width nuclei, giving rise to thicker fibrils as the primary product of hA assembly. In our first set of experiments, hA oligomers predominantly increased in height with increasing incubation periods. This was confirmed in the second set of experiments using timelapse AFM, which clearly showed that fibrils started elongating only after oligomers had grown to a height of ∼6 nm. Our results support a mechanism by which fibrils grow directly from hA oligomers or nuclei, which already have the full thickness, rather than by lateral association of protofibrils. We have seen that oligomeric species first increase in height on the mica surface, probably by the stacking of the smallest oligomers. This may actually be the first visualization of a secondary nucleation mechanism hypothesized by Padrick and Miranker (27Padrick S.B. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The lateral association of small oligomers prior to their longitudinal growth may possibly describe their results. Notwithstanding that our experiments were performed on a mica surface that might constrain the assembly of hA fibrils, we believe that the same two-step mechanism probably occurs in solution. It would explain why the 2.4 nm protofibril is seldom observed on its own except when growth is confined to a surface and the monomeric amylin concentration is depleted (28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oligomers reaching slightly variable heights prior to elongation may explain the different hA fibril polymorphisms that had been described previously (Fig. 5) (24Goldsbury C.S. Cooper G.J. Goldie K.N. Muller S.A. Saafi E.L. Gruijters W.T. Misur M.P. Engel A. Aebi U. Kistler J. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This way, an oligomer that grows to 6.9 nm in height before it elongates could give rise to the prominent 25-nm-repeat left-handed coiled fibril, thought previously to assemble by coiling two protofibrils around each other. Oligomers that grow larger in height than this could give rise to mature fibrils consisting of three or more protofibrils. One might argue that the initial increase in the height of the hA oligomer represents an elongation in the direction of the fibril axis. In this scenario, the oligomer would adsorb so that the fibril axis is perpendicular rather than parallel to the mica surface; thus, when the oligomer elongates, its height increases. When the oligomer becomes too long, it tips over, and as it lays down on the mica surface, it elongates further. We consider this interpretation unlikely as it would mean that the growth of one of the ends of the fibril is blocked by the initial adsorption to the mica surface. This is clearly not the case because the fibrils observed in the present study generally grew bidirectionally. In fact, the same bidirectionality was also observed previously for hA protofibrils on mica (28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). One might also expect that the end of the fibril, which was initially adsorbed to the mica, would be deformed; however, there is no evidence of this. Thus, we believe that our two-stage model is the most plausible in that oligomers first laterally grow before they start elongating. We have further demonstrated that time-lapse AFM can be used to assay the inhibitory effect of selected compounds on fibril formation. Congo red appeared to stabilize the hA oligomers, blocking both their lateral and longitudinal growth into mature fibrils, with inhibition of the former process occurring only in part. The inhibitory effect of Congo red is generally consistent with the literature (13Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 30Aitken J.F. Loomes K.M. Konarkowska B. Cooper G.J. Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10842-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reported that at high concentrations of Congo red, the dimeric immunoglobulin light chain variable domain, SMA, favored protein unfolding over aggregation (37Podlisny M.B.

Our observation that Congo red stabilizes hA at the oligomer level is particularly interesting in light of the current view that distinct amyloid oligomers rather than the polymorphic fibrils are the toxic agent. The situation may, however, be more complex as Congo red has also been reported to inhibit hA cytotoxicity and membrane activity (13Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 30Aitken J.F. Loomes K.M. Konarkowska B. Cooper G.J. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) AFM is unique in its ability to image dynamic processes at the nanometer scale and in real time under physiological buffer conditions. One perceived drawback is that fibril growth may be constrained by the mica surface. It should be noted, however, that in vivo environments also contain many surfaces such as the cell membrane. There may actually be an advantage that interactions with a surface result in the stabilization and/or accumulation of structures that are not easily detected in bulk solution, as is the case for the 2.4-nm hA protofibril (28Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Extending from this, direct visualization of the two-set process by which hA oligomers grow into fibrils has been achieved by trapping the oligomers on a surface and directly visualizing their growth and elongation by time-lapse AFM.

https://openalex.org/W1970465585,"The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) subgroup of mitogen-activated protein kinases has been implicated largely in stress responses, but an increasing body of evidence has suggested that JNK also plays a role in cell proliferation and survival. We examined the effect of JNK inhibition, using either SP600125 or specific antisense oligonucleotides, on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. SP600125 was selective for JNK in vitro and in vivo versus other kinases tested including ERK, p38, cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDK1), and CDK2. SP600125 inhibited JNK activity and KB-3 cell proliferation with the same dose dependence, suggesting that inhibition of proliferation was a direct consequence of JNK inhibition. Inhibition of proliferation by SP600125 was associated with an increase in the G2-M and apoptotic fractions of cells but was not associated with p53 or p21 induction. Antisense oligonucleotides to JNK2 but not JNK1 caused highly significant inhibition of cell proliferation. Wild-type mouse fibroblasts responded similarly with proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction, whereas c-jun-/- fibroblasts were refractory to the effects of SP600125, suggesting that JNK signaling to c-Jun is required for cell proliferation. Studies in synchronized KB-3 cells indicated that SP600125 delayed transit time through S and G2-M phases. Correspondingly, JNK activity increased in late S phase and peaked in late G2 phase. During synchronous mitotic progression, cyclin B levels increased concomitant with phosphorylation of c-Jun, H1 histone, and Bcl-2. In the presence of SP600125, mitotic progression was prolonged, and c-Jun phosphorylation was inhibited, but neither H1 nor Bcl-2 phosphorylation was inhibited. However, the CDK inhibitor roscovitine inhibited mitotic Bcl-2 phosphorylation. These results indicate that JNK, and more specifically the JNK2 isoform, plays a key role in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. In addition, conclusive evidence is presented that a kinase other than JNK, most likely CDK1 or a CDK1-regulated kinase, is responsible for mitotic Bcl-2 phosphorylation. The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) subgroup of mitogen-activated protein kinases has been implicated largely in stress responses, but an increasing body of evidence has suggested that JNK also plays a role in cell proliferation and survival.

Studies in synchronized KB-3 cells indicated that SP600125 delayed transit time through S and G2-M phases. Correspondingly, JNK activity increased in late S phase and peaked in late G2 phase. During synchronous mitotic progression, cyclin B levels increased concomitant with phosphorylation of c-Jun, H1 histone, and Bcl-2. In the presence of SP600125, mitotic progression was prolonged, and c-Jun phosphorylation was inhibited, but neither H1 nor Bcl-2 phosphorylation was inhibited. However, the CDK inhibitor roscovitine inhibited mitotic Bcl-2 phosphorylation. These results indicate that JNK, and more specifically the JNK2 isoform, plays a key role in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. In addition, conclusive evidence is presented that a kinase other than JNK, most likely CDK1 or a CDK1-regulated kinase, is responsible for mitotic Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK(s), mitogen-activated protein kinase(s); CDK, cyclin-dependent protein kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; ATF, activating transcription factor. play key roles in the cellular response to extracellular stimuli. Three major mammalian MAPK subgroups have been identified: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK (for review, see Refs. 1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 2Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The JNK subgroup is encoded by three genes: JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed whereas JNK3 is more restricted to the brain, testis, and heart (3Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). JNKs are most strongly activated by stress stimuli including UV and ionizing radiation, heat shock, inflammatory cytokines, metabolic inhibitors, and osmotic or redox shock (3Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway is involved in many forms of stress-induced apoptosis (3Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar, 5Lin A. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). JNK plays a pro-apoptotic role in stress-induced neuronal cell death via transcriptional activation of c-Jun (6Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar), and JNK-null embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to apoptosis induced by UV irradiation and other stress stimuli (7Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). However, under some circumstances, JNK plays a protective role and supports cell survival, and evidence is accumulating to suggest a role in cell proliferation, cell transformation and tumor progression, and embryonic morphogenesis (3Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). These diverse functions are likely because JNK operates in a manner that is dependent on the cell type, stimulus, and context, with the duration of activation and the specific spectrum of substrates targeted adding additional layers of regulatory complexity. Recent evidence supports the notion that JNK signaling is involved in cell growth and proliferation of unstressed cells. For example, most cultured cells have measurable basal JNK activity (8Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar), which is strongly and negatively affected by cell density (9Lallemand D. Ham J. Garbay S. Bakiri L. Traincard F. Jeannequin O. Pfarr C.M. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5615-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, many growth factors stimulate JNK activity (10Bost F. McKay R. Dean N. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33422-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 11Logan S.K. Falasca M. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 1997; 232: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); JNK is required for transformation by Ras and other oncogenes (for review, see Ref. 13Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar); and fibroblasts become partially transformed upon constitutive JNK activation (14Rennefahrt U.E. Illert B. Kerkhoff E. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29510-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Studies using antisense approaches have suggested a role for JNK in tumor cell growth. For example, depletion of JNK1 or JNK2 with antisense oligonucleotides inhibited cell growth of human glioblastoma cells associated with S phase arrest and induction of p21Cip1/Waf1 (15Potapova O. Gorospe M. Bost F. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Mercola D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24767-24775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Other studies revealed that antisense to JNK2 suppressed growth and induced apoptosis of tumor cell lines with mutant but not wild-type p53, with protection of wild-type p53 cells associated with p21Cip1/Waf1 induction (16Potapova O. Gorospe M. Dougherty R.H. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although JNK appears to be involved in cell proliferation, there is little evidence linking JNK activation to specific phases of the cell cycle. In Jurkat cells, JNK activity increased in G2-M phase and was reported to be responsible for mitotic Bcl-2 phosphorylation (17Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). In synchronized KB-3 cells, we observed amino-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun at G2-M phase (18Fan M. Du L. Stone A.A. Gilbert K.M. Chambers T.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6403-6407PubMed Google Scholar). In this study the role of JNK in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression was investigated utilizing several approaches, including the pharmacological inhibitor SP600125 (19Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar), antisense oligonucleotides, and c-jun-/- fibroblasts. We show that selective inhibition of JNK and in particular the JNK2 isoform inhibits proliferation associated with an increase in the G2-M and apoptotic subpopulations. Studies with highly synchronized cells confirmed that JNK is activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and that JNK inhibition results in an expanded cell cycle, with delays in both S and G2 phases. Our results also clarify a long-standing controversy and provide strong evidence that CDK1 rather than JNK is responsible for mitotic Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Materials—SP600125 was synthesized at the Signal Research Division of Celgene or obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) with identical results. Roscovitine was from Calbiochem. Antibodies to JNK1, JNK2, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, Bcl-2, and actin, and the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein substrates, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to p21, cyclin B, and PARP were from BD Biosciences, and antibody to p53 was from NeoMarkers (Union City, CA). Phospho-specific (Ser-63) c-Jun antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Phospho-specific H1 histone antibody, purified activated JNK2, CDK1/cyclin B, CDK2/cyclin E, and the substrate Rb (amino acids 773-928) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone, and other cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Unless otherwise stated, other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture—The KB-3 human carcinoma cell line was maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Wild-type and c-jun-/- mouse 3T3 fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. Erwin Wagner and maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (20Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays—Whole cell extracts used for evaluation of JNK, ERK, and p38 activity were prepared by suspending cells in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 20 min on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 × g. JNK was assayed by a glutathione bead pull-down method using a kit from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, cell extracts (0.25 mg of protein) were incubated with glutathione beads containing 1 μg of GST-c-Jun(1-79) fusion protein, centrifuged, washed, and incubated in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated substrate was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using phospho-specific c-Jun antibody. Quantitation of the inhibition of JNK by SP600125 was performed by densitometric scanning. To detect JNK activity in synchronized KB-3 cells, the same procedure was employed, except that 10,000 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP was used, and phosphorylated substrate was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. ERK and p38 activities were measured by immunocomplex assay with myelin basic protein or GST-ATF2(1-96) fusion protein as substrates, respectively, as described previously (21Osborn M.T. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30950-30955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 22Stone A.A. Chambers T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The effect of SP600125 on purified JNK was examined by incubating 5 milliunits of purified, activated JNK2 in a 50-μl reaction containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10,000 cpm/pmol). After 10 min at 30 °C, the mixture was spotted onto a P81 phosphocellulose disc, washed in 75 mm phosphoric acid, dried, and 32P radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. CDK1/cyclin B was assayed in the same manner except that 0.2 mg/ml histone H1 was used as substrate. CDK2/cyclin A was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.004% (w/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 40 μg/ml Rb (amino acids 773-928) as substrate, and 78 μm ATP (1,000 cpm/pmol). CDK2/cyclin E was assayed similarly except that 0.2 mg/ml H1 histone and 300 μm ATP were used as substrates. Reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 min, terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 7.2%, and acid-precipitated radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. All assays were conducted under conditions where phosphate incorporation was linear with respect to time and enzyme concentration. Cell Viability, Proliferation, and Clonogenic Assays—The effect of SP600125 on cell growth rate was determined by plating cells (2 × 105/well) in a 6-well plate, treating with 20 μm SP600125 or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO), and counting the number of trypan blue-excluding intact cells. Inhibition of cell proliferation was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (23Alley M.C. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Hursey M.L. Czerwinski M.J. Fine D.L. Abbott B.J. Mayo J.G. Shoemaker R.H. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (5,000/well) were plated in 96-well dishes and treated with either SP600125 or vehicle alone (0.1% Me2SO) for 72 h. All treatments were performed in triplicate, and viability was expressed as a percentage of the untreated controls (mean ± S.D.). Clonogenic assays were performed by plating 200 cells in a 60-mm dish and treating with 20 μm SP600125 or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO). Cells were incubated for 8 days and stained with 0.5% methylene blue in 50% methanol. Colonies that contained more than 50 cells were scored, and cloning efficiency was expressed as (number of colonies/number of plated cells) × 100. All treatments were performed in triplicate and results expressed as mean ± S.D. Flow Cytometry Analysis—To determine cell cycle distribution, 5 × 105 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and treated with 20 μm SP600125 or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) for periods up to 3 days. Cells were then collected by trypsinization, fixed in 70% ethanol, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml RNase and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, incubated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature, and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed using the ModFit DNA analysis program (Verity Software House). Antisense Inhibition of JNK Expression—JNK antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, each with 2′-O-methoxyethyl phosphodiester residues, were synthesized by ISIS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA), and were as follows: antisense JNK1 (AS-JNK1; ISIS 20572), 5′-CTC TCT GTA GGC CCG CTT GG-3′; antisense JNK2 (AS-JNK2; ISIS 20571), 5′-GTC CGG GCC AGG CCA AAG TC-3′; scrambled JNK1 (Scr-JNK1; ISIS 20567), 5′-CTT TCC GTT GGA CCC CTG GG-3′; and scrambled JNK2 (Scr-JNK2; ISIS 20569), 5′-GTG CGC GCG AGC CCG AAA TC-3′. Antisense inhibition of JNK1 and/or JNK2 expression was performed as described previously (24Fan M. Goodwin M. Vu T. Brantley-Finley C. Gaarde W.A. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29980-29985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides were added to DMEM in the presence of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) using 2 μl of Lipofectin/ml of DMEM and 100 nm oligonucleotide. After vigorous shaking, the preparation (1 ml) was added to low density KB-3 cells in 6-well plates (seeded 12 h prior at 2 × 105 cells/well). After 4.5 h, the transfection medium was supplemented with 1 ml of DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum, and cells were maintained for an additional 72 h. Adherent and nonadherent cells were combined, stained with trypan blue, and viable cells were counted under a microscope, with n = 6 for each condition. Determination of the expression of JNK1 and JNK2 from triplicate plates was performed by immunoblotting as described previously (24Fan M. Goodwin M. Vu T. Brantley-Finley C. Gaarde W.A. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29980-29985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the chemiluminescent signal to estimate JNK isoform expression was performed using the VersaDoc™ imaging system (Bio-Rad). To estimate the efficiency of oligonucleotide uptake, a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antisense oligonucleotide to c-Raf (ISIS 13153), which is taken up by cells in a similar manner (15Potapova O. Gorospe M. Bost F. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Mercola D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24767-24775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), was used. Cells were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotide as described above, and after 72 h were examined by fluorescent microscopy using an Olympus IX-70 microscope equipped with a BA515IF filter. 500 cells were examined, and those displaying relatively high fluorescence versus background fluorescence were recorded as positive. Cell Synchronization—KB-3 cells were synchronized by the double thymidine block method as described previously (18Fan M. Du L. Stone A.A. Gilbert K.M. Chambers T.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6403-6407PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in medium containing 2 mm thymidine for 16 h, released into normal medium for 9 h, and then incubated for 16 h in medium containing 2 mm thymidine. Preparation of Cell Extracts for Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared by suspending cells in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 15 min on ice, extracts were sonicated (3 × 10 s), insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 12,000 × g), and protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Immunoblotting was performed using 50 μg of protein/lane. SP600125 Selectively Inhibits JNK in KB-3 Cells—To determine the efficacy of SP600125 in KB-3 cells, cells were pretreated with different concentrations of SP600125 for 1 h, then briefly exposed to anisomycin to stimulate JNK activity. Cells extracts were prepared and assayed for JNK activity. SP600125 had no effect up to 3 μm but was effective in the range 10-30 μm, with an IC50 value of ∼14 μm (Fig. 1A). To determine the selectivity of SP600125 for JNK versus other MAPKs, ERK and p38 were assayed under similar conditions. Untreated KB-3 cells exhibit constitutively activate ERK that was unaffected by anisomycin and unaffected by concentrations of SP600125 sufficient to inhibit JNK (Fig. 1B). We also tested the effect of SP600125 on p38. Basal p38 activity is nearly undetectable in untreated KB-3 cells (21Osborn M.T. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30950-30955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), but it was readily activated by anisomycin treatment and was relatively unaffected by SP600125 (Fig. 1C). In vitro, SP600125 inhibited active, purified JNK2 with an IC50 of about 0.2 μm (Fig. 1D and Table I). These results suggest that SP600125 is ∼70-fold more potent in vitro than in the context of KB-3 cells. This differential between the in vitro-based and cell-based assays is similar to results reported previously, where SP600125 exhibited an IC50 for JNK inhibition of 0.04-0.09 μm in vitro and 5-10 μm in stimulated Jurkat cells (19Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). SP600125 also exhibited selectivity for JNK versus several CDKs tested in vitro including CDK1/cyclin B, CDK2/cyclin E, and CDK2/cyclin A (Table I).Table IInhibitory profile in vitro of SP600125 toward JNK versus CDKsProtein kinaseIC50aValues shown are the mean ± S.D.μmJNK20.20 ± 0.02 (n = 4)CDK1/cyclin B6.3 ± 0.7 (n = 4)CDK2/cyclin E22.2 ± 3.7 (n = 3)CDK2/cyclin A3.96 ± 0.45 (n = 7)a Values shown are the mean ± S.D. Open table in a new tab SP600125 Inhibits KB-3 Cell Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis—A series of experiments was conducted to determine the effect of SP600125 on the proliferation of KB-3 cells. First, the effect on cell growth rate was examined. KB-3 cells were treated with vehicle or 20 μm SP600125 for periods up to 3 days, and the number of viable cells was determined daily. As shown in Fig. 2A, SP600125 had little effect after 24 h, but significantly retarded cell growth after 2-3 days. To characterize further the effect of SP600125 on proliferation, clonogenic assays were performed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Untreated KB-3 cells exhibited a cloning efficiency of 60%, whereas no clones were found in the presence of SP600125 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the inhibitor prevents normal proliferation, consistent with the data of Fig. 2A. To determine whether SP600125 exhibited dose-dependent effects on cell proliferation, MTT assays were performed. SP600125 had no effect on viable cell mass up to a concentration of 3 μm but exhibited dose-dependent effects in the range 10-30 μm, with an IC50 of 13 μm (Fig. 2C), closely corresponding to that for JNK inhibition. To determine whether SP600125 altered cell cycle distribution and/or induced apoptosis, cells were treated with SP600125 for periods up to 3 days and subjected to flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Little change was noted after 1 day of treatment, but after 2 and 3 days of treatment, two main changes were observed (Fig. 2D). First, there was an increase in the percentage of cells in the G2-M phase at the expense of cells in G1. Second, there was an increase in cells with a sub-G1 DNA content, indicative of an apoptotic population. To confirm further that SP600125 induced apoptosis, PARP cleavage was examined. PARP cleavage was not evident in control cells or in cells treated with SP600125 for 1 day, but the cleavage product of PARP, as well as intact PARP, was observed in cells treated with SP600125 for 2 or 3 days (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that after prolonged treatment, a proportion of the cells becomes apoptotic, consistent with the results of Fig. 2D. Collectively, the results of Fig. 2 suggest that SP600125 displays more a cytostatic rather than an acutely cytotoxic effect. Inhibition of KB-3 Cell Proliferation by JNK Antisense Oligonucleotides—To assess independently the effect of JNK inhibition on cell proliferation, a complementary approach using antisense oligonucleotides was employed. KB-3 cells were treated with AS-JNK1, AS-JNK2, or a combination of both, and controls were treated with scrambled versions of the corresponding oligonucleotides, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Treatment with AS-JNK1 or AS-JNK2 resulted in reduced expression of the corresponding JNK isoform, and combined treatment reduced expression of both isoforms, whereas scrambled oligonucleotides were without effect. Representative results are shown in Fig. 3A. The results of three independent determinations indicated that the antisense oligonucleotides reduced JNK isoform expression by ∼50% under these conditions (Fig. 3B). Transfection efficiency under these conditions, determined using an fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotide as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was estimated to be ∼60%. Thus, the reduction in JNK isoform expression level was consistent with the transfection efficiency. The growth of KB-3 cells treated with scrambled or JNK antisense oligonucleotides was examined under the same conditions (Fig. 3C). AS-JNK1 had no effect on cell growth, whereas AS-JNK2 highly significantly inhibited cell growth (p < 0.00005 by Student's t test) as did the combination of AS-JNK1 and AS-JNK2 (p < 0.00003). The reduction in cell growth by AS-JNK2 of 50% was similar to the reduction in JNK2 isoform expression, suggesting that cells with depleted JNK2 are highly susceptible to growth inhibition. These results confirm that inhibition of JNK results in inhibition of cell growth and further suggest a specific role for JNK2 versus JNK1 in KB-3 cell proliferation. SP600125 Inhibits Proliferation of Wild-type but Not c-jun-/- Fibroblasts—To determine whether non-tumor cells also responded to SP600125 with growth inhibition, experiments were conducted with mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. SP600125 inhibited fibroblast proliferation (Fig. 4A). This was confirmed by clonogenic assays, where cloning efficiency of untreated fibroblasts was 20 ± 4%, whereas no clones were found in the presence of SP600125 (Fig. 4B). MTT assays were performed to evaluate dose-dependent effects. SP600125 had little effect on viable cell mass up to a concentration of 3 μm, but exhibited dose-dependent effects in the range 10-30 μm, with an IC50 of ∼20 μm (Fig. 4C). The effect of SP600125 on the distribution of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts in the cell cycle was also examined (Fig. 4D). After 1 day, SP600125 treatment caused an increase in the fraction of cells in G2-M phase as well as increases in the population of cells with sub-G1 DNA and >4 n DNA. These latter subpopulations expanded after 2 days of treatment, and after 3 days, mostly sub-G1 cells were observed. PARP cleavage was also examined and confirmed the progressive induction of apoptosis from 1 to 3 days of treatment (Fig. 4E). Experiments were next conducted to compare the effects of SP600125 on wild-type versus c-jun-/- fibroblasts. We reasoned that if SP600125 inhibited proliferation specifically through effects on the JNK/c-Jun pathway, then c-jun-/- cells should be relatively unaffected. Wild-type fibroblasts proliferated with a doubling time of 24 h, whereas c-jun-/- cells proliferated more slowly with a doubling time of 48 h, consistent with previous results (20Schreiber M.

Here we describe a new, enzyme-mediated method for generating numerous functional siRNA constructs from any gene of interest or pool of genes. To test our restriction enzyme-generated siRNA (REGS) system, we silenced a transgene and two endogenous genes and obtained the predicted phenotypes. REGS generated on average 34 unique siRNAs per kilobase of sequence. REGS enabled us to create enzymatically a complex siRNA library (>4 x 10(5) clones) from double-stranded cDNA encompassing known and unknown genes with 96% of the clones containing inserts of the appropriate size."
https://openalex.org/W2006829355,"Pairing, synapsis, and recombination are prerequisites for accurate chromosome segregation in meiosis. The phs1 gene in maize is required for pairing to occur between homologous chromosomes. In the phs1 mutant, homologous chromosome synapsis is completely replaced by synapsis between nonhomologous partners. The phs1 gene is also required for installation of the meiotic recombination machinery on chromosomes, as the mutant almost completely lacks chromosomal foci of the recombination protein RAD51. Thus, in the phs1 mutant, synapsis is uncoupled from recombination and pairing. The protein encoded by the phs1 gene likely acts in a multistep process to coordinate pairing, recombination, and synapsis."

PRL phosphatases constitute a novel class of small (20 kDa), prenylated phosphatases with oncogenic activity.

As shown for the human PRL-2, the role of PRLs is associated with the regulation of progression through mitosis, and their cellular localization is likely controlled by the cell cycle (8Wang J. Kirby C.E. Herbst R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46659-46668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). PRL phosphatases are widely distributed in eukaryotes. In humans, PRL-1 and PRL-2 are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues (6Zeng Q. Hong W. Tan Y.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), whereas PRL-3 is normally expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles (5Matter W.F. Estridge T. Zhang C. Belagaje R. Stancato L.

Comprising typically only 140-180 amino acids, PRLs are among the smallest phosphatases. They consist of a single catalytic domain lacking any auxiliary docking/regulatory domains other than the prenylation site at the C terminus. PRLs contain the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; DSP, dual specificity phosphatase; VHR, vaccinia H1-related phosphatase; CDC, cell division cycle phosphatase; KAP, kinase-associated phosphatase; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy; DTT, dithiothreitol; OMFP, 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate. active consensus motif HCXXGXXR, referred to as the P-loop; however, their primary sequence shows only remote similarity to phosphatases in other regions. Tyrosine-specific phosphatases as well as dual specificity phosphatases (DSP), enzymes capable of dephosphorylating both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine/serine residues, share the same general catalytic mechanism. The key structural elements include the positively charged phosphate-binding region of the P-loop and a catalytic cysteine residue that possesses an unusually low pKa of ∼5 such that its side chain exists as a thiolate at a physiological pH. During catalysis, this cysteine acts as a nucleophile to form a thiophosphoryl enzyme intermediate, and a conserved aspartic acid in a neighboring loop participates in both the formation and the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate. The conserved arginine in the P-loop is important for the stabilization of the transition state (for a review, see Ref. 9Zhang Z.Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In many PTPases, correct positioning of the flexible loop containing the catalytic aspartate is critical for activation and catalytic performance of these enzymes (10Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Recent interest in PRL phosphatases relates to their role in cell proliferation, including promotion of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (2Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A.

Cancer Lett. 2003; 202: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) experiments showed that PRL-3 is massively overexpressed in colon tumors metastasizing to the liver but not in nonmetastatic tumors and in normal colorectal epithelium (13Saha S. Bardelli A. Buckhaults P. Velculescu V.E. Rago C. St. Croix B. Romans K.E. Choti M.A. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2001; 294: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Further support for the involvement of PRL-3 in metastasis was provided by the finding of gene amplification in a significant fraction of metastatic lesions from different patients (13Saha S. Bardelli A. Buckhaults P. Velculescu V.E. Rago C. St. Croix B. Romans K.E. Choti M.A. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2001; 294: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Because of the massive levels of overexpression, PRL-3 constitutes a useful marker for metastasis and possibly a new therapeutic target. More studies at both the physiological and biochemical level are needed to better understand the function of PRL phosphatases and, in particular, to evaluate their involvement and role in metastasis. Here, we determined the solution structure of PRL-3 and classify it as a member of the family of dual specificity phosphatases. The structure and site-directed mutagenesis experiments identify residues that are important for PRL-3 catalytic activity and reveal unique features that distinguish PRL-3 from other phosphatases. PRL-3 Expression and Purification—The human phosphatase PRL-3 sequence, comprising amino acids 1-169, was subcloned into the pET15b vector (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as a His-tagged fusion protein. The protein was purified as described previously (14Kozlov G. Cheng J. Lievre C. Banville D. Gehring K. Ekiel I. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The resulting protein contains the N-terminal extension (Gly-Ser-His) from the cleavage site of the vector and does not include the C-terminal prenylation site (Cys-Cys-Val-Met). Isotopically enriched PRL-3 was prepared from cells grown on minimal M9 medium containing [15N]ammonium chloride with or without [13C6]glucose (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratory, Andover, MA). The PRL-3 isoforms were expressed and purified as described above. PRL-3 mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR. The identities of the proteins were checked by DNA sequencing and further verified at the protein level by mass spectrometry (Sciex APII electrospray mass spectrometer; Thornhill, ON, Canada). All of the mutants were expressed and purified using the same protocol as for the wild-type PRL-3. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples with a protein concentration of 3 mm were exchanged into 50 mm phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, 10-12 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm sodium azide, pH 6.80. NMR experiments were performed at 308 K. Backbone and side chain NMR signal assignments of PRL-3 were determined as described previously (14Kozlov G. Cheng J. Lievre C. Banville D. Gehring K. Ekiel I. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). NOE constraints for the structure determination were obtained from 15N-edited and homonuclear NOESY obtained at Bruker DRX 500-MHz spectrometer and 13C-edited NOESY acquired on a Varian Inova 800-MHz spectrometer. The mixing time was 110 ms for these experiments. 3JHN-Hα coupling constants were obtained from an HNHA experiment (15Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker Biospin) and GIFA (16Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 8: 445-452Google Scholar) software and analyzed with XEASY (17Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—NOE restraints were obtained from 15N- and 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY experiments and from two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY spectra. The φ and ψ torsion angles were derived from Cα, Cβ, and Hα chemical shifts using TALOS (18Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) and compared with experimental values resulting from an HNHA experiment. The structures were calculated using the ARIA module (19Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) implemented in the program CNS (version 1.1) (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

The initial set of several hundred NOEs was assigned for the protein and used to calculate the first ensemble of structures. Manually assigned distance constraints were classified according to the peak intensities as strong (1.8-3.0 Å), medium (1.8-4.0 Å), and weak (1.8-5.0 Å). Two-dimensional NOESY, three-dimensional 15N NOESY, and three-dimensional 13C NOESY spectra were used in the ARIA protocol to calibrate and assign NOE cross-peaks. The unambiguous distance restraints obtained after eight rounds of calculations were used to calculate the final set of structures. The quality of the obtained structures was assessed using PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

All of the assays were performed at 22 °C in TBA buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.15), containing 6 mm DTT, 5% Me2SO. The substrate concentration ranged from 0 to 200 μm. Enzyme concentrations for the wild-type protein and the D71A and C49A mutants were determined from the “burst” amplitude (B) as 2.1, 4.5, and 2.5 μm, respectively. Concentration of the A111S mutant was calculated to be 0.5 μm. Hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of the enzyme to the reaction mixture and monitored for 90 min using a SpectraMAX-220 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) plate reader. The raw data were fitted to Equation 1, v=[(V0×t)+(V0-Vs/k)×(1-e-kt)]+a(Eq. 1) where V0 is the initial rate, k is the reaction constant (burst constant), and Vs is the steady-state rate for the linear portion of the reaction plot. The burst amplitude (B) can be obtained by intersecting the linear part of the reaction plot with the y axis (product). The B value derived from the plot for the reaction where [S] >> Km, i.e. saturating substrate concentration, is stoichiometric to the enzyme concentration [E]. The kinetic constants were defined according to the following enzymatic scheme, E+S⇌k-1k1ES→k2E····P→k3E+PScheme 1 where E is the enzyme, S is the substrate, ES is the enzyme-substrate complex, E....P is the phosphoenzyme intermediate, and P is the leaving phosphate group. The Michaelis-Menten equation was used to obtain kcat and Km after fitting Vs versus [S]. To analyze the exponential phase of the progress curve and to obtain k2 + k3 and KS values kburst (burst constant) was fitted against [S] to provide Equation 2. kburst=(k2+k3)×[S]/(KS+[S])(Eq. 2) To dissect k2 + k3 sum of the rate constants, k2 was derived after fitting B versus [S] to Equation 3. B=[E](k2/(k2+k3))2/(1+(Km/[S]))2(Eq. 3) When k2 >> k3, i.e. dissociation of the E .... P to E + P is rate-limiting, k3 = kcat, and kcat/Km represents the catalytic efficiency of the phosphatase (22Gottlin E.B. Xu X. Epstein D.M. Burke S.P. Eckstein J.W. Ballou D.P. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27445-27449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—Three-dimensional models of phosphatases PRL-1 and PRL-2 were constructed by homology modeling using the program Modeler 6v1 (23Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), using the experimentally determined structure of PRL-3 as a template. Sybyl 6.4 software (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) was used for further structure refinement and analysis. Structural refinement was performed by energy minimization using an AMBER 4.1 all-atom force field (24Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 177: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar) with the Powell minimizer, a distance-dependent (4r) dielectric constant and an 8 Å nonbonded cut-off. The N and C termini were blocked with acetyl- and methylamino groups, respectively, and hydrogen atoms were added explicitly. Solution Structure of PRL-3—We determined the structure of the human phosphatase PRL-3, the first of the PRL protein family. The previously reported resonance assignments (14Kozlov G. Cheng J. Lievre C. Banville D. Gehring K. Ekiel I. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were used to assign NOEs from heteronuclear 15N- and 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY and homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY experiments. The excellent quality spectra yielded a large number of distance constraints. TALOS was applied to generate dihedral angle constraints based on Cα, Cβ, and Hα chemical shifts. These values were confirmed by experimentally determined coupling constants from an HNHA experiment. On average, 15.4 constraints/residue in the PRL-3 structured region (Ala8-Arg153) were used to calculate the PRL-3 structure. The 20 lowest energy structures out of 60 calculated were chosen to represent the final ensemble. The structural statistics are shown in Table I. PRL-3 is comprised of a five-stranded β-sheet and six α-helices (Fig. 1). Strand β1 (Val10-Ser13) is antiparallel with respect to the remaining four parallel strands β2 (Met17-Thr22), β3 (Val45-Val48), β4 (Val65-Trp68), and β5 (Cys99-Val102). The helices α1 (Leu30-Tyr40) and α2 (Lys55-Asp61) are on one side of the β-sheet, and the remaining four, α3 (Lys79-Glu94), α4 (Ala111-Ser122), α5 (Lys125-Gln135), and α6 (Lys144-Tyr152), form a cluster on the opposite side of the β-sheet. This arrangement of the secondary structure elements and overall fold is typical for DSP, structurally classifying PRL-3 as a member of this class of phosphatases. A comparison using DALI server reveals the closest similarity to the dual specificity phosphatases VHR (Protein Data Bank code 1vhr), PTEN (the phosphatase and tensin homologue; 1d5r), and KAP (1fpz) with Z scores of 10.4, 10.1, and 9.9, respectively. The root mean square deviation value between PRL-3 and each phosphatase is ∼2 Å for the 60-80 α-carbons in the conserved elements of secondary structure. Structure-based sequence alignment with other dual specificity phosphatases and tyrosine phosphatases shows sequence identity below 20%, which is typical for this relatively divergent class of enzymes (Fig. 2). This low sequence similarity leads to significant local structural differences. Interestingly, particularly large differences are observed in the loops surrounding the active site, responsible for both catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Fig. 3A shows an enlarged view of this region in PRL-3. The catalytic residues Cys104 and Arg110 are located at opposite ends of the catalytic P-loop. The hydrophobicity of conserved amino acids between Cys104 and Arg110 distinguishes PRL-3 from other dual specificity phosphatases. The amino acids in this region have been shown to contribute to substrate specificity for numerous phosphatases (25Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E.

The other distinct feature of the PRL-3 catalytic site is the lack of protruding loops (Fig. 3B), which often participate in substrate binding (10Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 27Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The N terminus, preceding strand β1, which is usually structured in protein-tyrosine phosphatases and contributes to substrate binding, is unstructured and mobile in PRL-3. The region following strand β2, which recognizes binding partners for KAP phosphatase (27Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 615-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), is much shorter and flat. The loop following strand β3 is also much shorter and flatter than in the PTP1B, VHR, PYST, and KAP phosphatases (10Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 27Song H. Hanlon N. Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Barford D. Mol.

Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The resulting catalytic pocket is extremely shallow and suggests a broad range of specificity for PRL-3. Dephosphorylation is mediated by an acidic residue in the loop adjacent to the catalytic P-loop that serves as a general acid by contributing a proton to the leaving phenolate or serine/threonine group (29Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments suggest that Asp72 in the β4-α3 loop could serve as a general acid for PRL-3 (Fig. 2). This loop also includes four prolines and two glycines responsible for its unusual conformation and high mobility (data not shown). This loop does not seem to interact with other parts of the protein and may undergo conformational changes upon substrate binding. Such substrate-induced conformational adjustment was observed for PTP1B and PYST (10Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 30Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is possible that PRL-3 requires substrate activation, bringing the general acid residue closer to the catalytic cysteine to become fully active because poor activity was observed with synthetic substrates (see below). Mutagenesis and Kinetic Analysis—The conserved catalytic residues Cys104 and Arg110 define the signature motif of PTPases and suggest a similar mechanism of dephosphorylation in PRL phosphatases. Because the C104A mutation was already shown to abolish the catalytic activity of PRL-3 (5Matter W.F. Estridge T. Zhang C. Belagaje R. Stancato L. Dixon J. Johnson B. Bloem L. Pickard T. Donaghue M. Acton S. Jeyaseelan R. Kadambi V. Vlahos C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), our mutagenesis experiments focused on the other conserved residues of the active site such as Ala111, Asp71, Asp72, and Cys49. PRL-3 showed extremely low activity with phosphorylated peptides and the commonly used synthetic substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (data not shown). For this reason, a more reactive substrate, OMFP, was chosen (22Gottlin E.B. Xu X. Epstein D.M. Burke S.P. Eckstein J.W. Ballou D.P. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27445-27449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the wild-type protein showed a slow, two-step reaction with the formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate and very slow, kinetically limiting release of phosphate group for regeneration of the free enzyme (Fig. 4). This differs from the fast burst phase of catalysis observed with other phosphatases (22Gottlin E.B. Xu X. Epstein D.M. Burke S.P. Eckstein J.W. Ballou D.P. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step for PRL-3 activity is the dephosphorylation (regeneration) of the enzyme. The value of kcat/Km obtained for the wild-type PRL-3 was 7.5 s-1m-1, which is 3 orders of magnitude lower than that for a typical DSP such as CDC25 and VHR (22Gottlin E.B. Xu X. Epstein D.M.

Surprisingly, both constants KS and Km (Table II) are very similar to those determined for CDC25 (23Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), implying that in the case of PRL-3 not substrate binding but stability of the phosphoenzyme (EP) is responsible for the slow kinetics.Table IIResults of kinetic analysis for the wild-type PRL-3 and the PRL-3 mutantsPRL-3Exponential phaseaThe analysis of the “burst” phase showed that k2 + k3 = k2, indicating that k2 ≫ k3.Steady-state phasek2KSkcatKmRelative kcatRelative kcat/KmbThe kcat/Km for wild-type PRL-3 is 7.5 s−1m−1.s−1μms−1μmWild type9.8·10−3389.02.5·10−434.41.01.0C49A4.5·10−3330.02.7·10−438.71.10.9D71A3.2·10−399.81.7·10−481.40.70.3D72A<1.0·10−5A111SNDcND, not determined.ND7.1·10−3111.028.48.6a The analysis of the “burst” phase showed that k2 + k3 = k2, indicating that k2 ≫ k3.b The kcat/Km for wild-type PRL-3 is 7.5 s−1m−1.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab A111S Mutant—The most striking feature in the catalytic site of PRL-3 is the presence of an alanine next to the catalytic arginine in the P-loop. Nearly all tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases have a serine or threonine in this position, and the hydroxyl group of this conserved residue is important for the breakdown of the phosphoenzyme intermediate and for stabilizing the thiolate group of the catalytic cysteine (31Denu J.M.

H., and Kundu, G. C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 28593–28606). However, the role(s) of OPN on AP-1-mediated uPA secretion and cell motility and the involvement of c-Src/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in these processes in breast cancer cells are not well defined. In this study we report that OPN induces αvβ3 integrin-mediated c-Src kinase activity in both highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. Ligation of OPN with αvβ3 integrin induces kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in MDA-MB-231 and wild type EGFR-transfected MCF-7 cells, and this was inhibited by the dominant negative form of c-Src (dn c-Src) indicating that c-Src kinase plays a crucial role in this process. OPN induces association between αvβ3 integrin and EGFR on the cell membrane in a macromolecular form with c-Src. Furthermore, OPN induces αvβ3 integrin/EGFR-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and AP-1 activation. Moreover, dn c-Src also suppressed the OPN-induced phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity in these cells indicating that c-Src acts as master switch in regulating MEK/ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways. OPN-induced ERK phosphorylation, AP-1 activation, uPA secretion, and cell motility were suppressed when cells were transfected with dn c-Src or pretreated with αvβ3 integrin antibody, c-Src kinase inhibitor (pp2), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PD153035), and MEK-1 inhibitor (PD98059). To our knowledge, this is the first report that OPN induces αvβ3 integrin-mediated AP-1 activity and uPA secretion by activating c-Src/EGFR/ERK signaling pathways and further demonstrates a functional molecular link between OPN-induced integrin/c-Src-dependent EGFR phosphorylation and ERK/AP-1-mediated uPA secretion, and all of these ultimately control the motility of breast cancer cells.

OPN acts both as chemokine and cytokine. It is produced by osteoclast, macrophages, T cells, hematopoietic cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (3Weber G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1552: 61-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has an N-terminal signal sequence, a highly acidic region consisting of nine consecutive aspartic acid residues, a GRGDS cell adhesion sequence predicted to be flanked by the β-sheet structure (4Prince C.W.

OPN regulates cell adhesion, cell migration, ECM invasion, and cell proliferation by interacting with its receptor αvβ3 integrin in various cell types (6Panda D. Kundu G.C. Lee B.I. Peri A. Fohl D.

Integrins are non-covalently associated, heterodimeric, cellsurface glycoproteins with α- and β-subunits. The various combinations of the α- and β-subunits form integrin dimers with diverse ligand specificity and biological activities. The interaction of cell-surface integrin with ECM proteins can lead to the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, and migration. Integrin-dependent signaling includes Ca2+ influx, cytoplasmic alkalinization, potassium channel activation, activation of lipid mediators, tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), ERK1 and ERK2 (16Clark E.A.

Integrin transduces intracellular signaling by interacting with FAK and Src (21Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After activation by integrins, p125 FAK is phosphorylated at Tyr-397 which serves as a binding site for SH2 domain of c-Src and other Src family kinases (23Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The Src kinase then phosphorylates Tyr-925 of FAK. This generates binding site of the Grb2-SOS complex that leads to the activation of MAPK cascades. Src family kinase could also activate MAPK pathway independent of FAK (24Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the ErbB growth factor receptor family. The overexpression of EGFR has been correlated with tumor progression and poor metastasis in breast and colon cancers (25Khazaie K. Schirrmacher V. Lichtner R.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 255-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 26Radinsky R. Risin S. Fan D. Dong Z. Bielenberg D. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 216: 261-271Google Scholar). The oncogenic effects of EGFR include enhanced DNA synthesis, cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. In fibroblasts, c-Src synergistically increases the oncogenic activity of EGFR suggesting that these two kinases may cooperate in the progression of a malignant phenotype (27Maa M.C. Leu T.H. MeCarley D. Schatzman R.C. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6981-6985Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). c-Src activity has been shown to be required for both the mitogenic effect of EGF in fibroblasts (28Roche S. Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the migratory effects of EGF in epithelial cells (29Rodier J.M. Valles A.M. Denoyelle M. Thiery J.P. Boyer B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Earlier reports have indicated that OPN induces migration of human mammary epithelial cells through activation of EGFR (30Tuck A.B. Hota C. Wilson S.M. Chambers A.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been described that c-Src catalytic activity is required for αvβ3 integrin-EGFR macromolecular complex formation followed by EGFR phosphorylation (31Moro L. Dolce L. Cabodi S. Bergatto E. Erba E.B. Smeriglio M. Turco E. Retta S.F. Giuffrida M.G. Venturino M. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Conti A. Schaefer E. Beguinot L. Tacchetti C. Gaggini P. Silengo L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. J. Biol.

Anticancer Res. 2002; 22: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of ERK1 and ERK2 by the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, resulted in the significant inhibition of the basal cell migration (33Price J.T. Tiganis T. Agarwal A. Djakiew D. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5475-5478PubMed Google Scholar). MEK-1 is a serine/threonine kinase that modulates the ERK1/2 pathway (34Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 plays key role in regulation of the transcription factor, AP-1, as its activation leads to the induction of c-Fos, which associates with c-Jun to form an AP-1 heterodimeric complex that can promote targeted gene expression (35Karin M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which OPN regulates c-Src-dependent EGFR transactivation and whether this leads to the activation of AP-1 through MAPK signaling pathway is not clearly understood. uPA is a member of the serine protease family that interacts with the uPA receptor and facilitates the conversion of inert zymogen plasminogen into widely acting serine protease plasmin (36Besser D. Verde P. Nagamine Y. Blasi F. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 214-237Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Plasmin regulates cell invasion by degrading matrix proteins such as fibronectin, type IV collagen, and laminin or indirectly by activating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (37Dano K. Andreasen P.A.

We have demonstrated recently (15Das R. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28593-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that OPN regulates NFκB-mediated uPA secretion in breast cancer cells. AP-1 transcription factor duplex also plays a major role in regulation of uPA expression through binding to its promoter (42DeCasare D. Vallone D. Caracciolo A. Sassone-Corsi P. Nerlov C. Verde P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 365-376PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which OPN controls AP-1-mediated uPA expression and cell motility in breast cancer cells is not well defined. In this paper, we investigate the involvement of OPN in αvβ3 integrin/c-Src/EGFR-dependent activation of AP-1 and uPA secretion in breast cancer cells. Taken together, we demonstrate that OPN induces αvβ3 integrin-mediated c-Src kinase activity that ultimately phosphorylates ERK1/2 through EGFR-dependent and -independent pathways. This leads to the induction of uPA secretion, cell motility, and ECM invasion through activation of AP-1, which is a prerequisite for proteolytic degradation, invasion, and distant metastasis.

Mouse monoclonal anti-uPA antibody was obtained from Oncogene. Mouse monoclonal anti-human αvβ3 integrin antibody was from Chemicon International. PD153035, pp2, and PD98059 were obtained from Calbiochem. Rabbit muscle enolase was from ICN. LipofectAMINE Plus and GRGDSP and GRGESP peptides were purchased from Invitrogen. The anti-OPN antibody was purchased from R & D Systems. The dual luciferase reporter assay system and AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide were from Promega. Boyden-type cell migration chambers were obtained from Corning Glass, and Bio-Coat Matrigel™ invasion chambers were from Collaborative Biomedical. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (Hyderabad, India). All other chemicals were analytical grade. Cell Culture—The MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. OPN Purification—OPN was purified from human milk as described previously (13Philip S. Bulbule A. Kundu G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44926-44935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cleared milk sample was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephadex column. The fraction containing partially purified OPN was purified further on an FPLC Resource-Q column and rechromatographed on the same Resource-Q column. The purity of OPN was checked by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue or Silver staining. The purified OPN was characterized by Western blot using anti-OPN antibody. Because EGF and TGF-α are also present in milk, we therefore have checked whether trace amounts of EGF or TGF-α are present in the purified OPN preparation. Accordingly, purified OPN was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using either a mixture of anti-OPN and anti-EGF or anti-TGF-α antibody. This purified OPN was used throughout these studies. Plasmids and DNA Transfection—Wild type EGFR (EGFR-WT) and kinase-inactive mutant EGFR (EGFR-K–) cDNA constructs were generous gifts from Dr. A. N. Habib (Beth Israel Deaconess Medial Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston). Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, cDNA (8 μg) was mixed with Plus reagent, and then cDNA reagent Plus was incubated with LipofectAMINE. The LipofectAMINE Plus cDNA complex was added to the cells and incubated further at 37 °C for 12 h. The control cells received LipofectAMINE Plus alone. The cell viability was detected by a trypan blue dye exclusion test. After incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were refed with fresh medium and maintained for an additional 12 h. In other experiments, these cells were individually transfected with the dominant negative form of c-Src cDNA (K296R/Y528F, dn c-Src) in pUSEamp (Upstate Biotechnology) under the same conditions as described above. These transfected cells were used for EGFR phosphorylation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, uPA expression by Western blot analysis, AP-1 activity by luciferase reporter gene assay, cell migration, and ECM invasion assays. Western Blot Analysis—To delineate the role of OPN in regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN at 37 °C for 0–60 min. In another experiment, both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were individually pretreated with anti-αvβ3 integrin blocking antibody (20 μg/ml), GRGDSP (10 μm), GRGESP (10 μm), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (25 pm PD153035), c-Src kinase domain inhibitor (2 nm pp2), or MEK-1 inhibitor (50 μm PD98059) for 1 h and then treated with OPN as described above. In separate experiments, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild type EGFR (EGFR-WT) or kinase-inactive mutant of EGFR (EGFR-K–) cDNA, or both these cells were transfected with dn c-Src cDNA in the presence of LipofectAMINE Plus and then stimulated with OPN. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm EDTA) containing 25 mm NaF and 2 mm Na3VO4. The cleared lysates were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the lysate was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. The lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrotransferred from gel to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody and incubated further with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG. The membrane was washed and detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was reprobed with rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibody to ensure equal protein loading. To investigate the role of αvβ3 integrin, c-Src, EGFR, and ERK1/2 in OPN-induced uPA secretion, both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were individually pretreated with anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (20 μg/ml), GRGDSP (10 μm), GRGESP (10 μm), PD153035 (25 pm) (MDA-MB-231 alone), pp2 (2 nm), PD98059 (50 μm) for 1 h and then treated with 5 μm OPN for an additional 24 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using mouse monoclonal anti-uPA antibody. In separate experiments, both these cells were individually transfected with EGFR-WT, EGFR-K–, or dn c-Src cDNA in the presence of LipofectAMINE Plus and then treated with 5 μm OPN for 24 h. The level of uPA in cell lysates was detected by Western blot analysis. The same blots were reprobed with anti-actin antibody as loading control. Immunoprecipitation—To examine the effect of OPN in regulation of EGFR phosphorylation, both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN at 37 °C for 0–60 min. In separate experiments, MCF-7 cells were transfected with EGFR-WT or EGFR-K– and then treated with 5 μm OPN for 0–60 min as described above. In other experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells or EGFR-WT transfected MCF-7 cells were either pretreated with anti-αvβ3 integrin blocking antibody (20 μg/ml), GRGDSP (10 μm), GRGESP (10 μm), pp2 (2 nm), or transfected with dn c-Src and then treated with 5 μm OPN for 30 min. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody. The immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blot using mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The same blots were reprobed with rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody as loading controls. To delineate whether OPN regulates any direct interactions between αvβ3 integrin and EGFR or c-Src in breast cancer cells, non-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells or EGFR-WT-transfected MCF-7 cells were individually treated with OPN (5 μm) for 0–30 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody. Half of the immunocomplex was immunoblotted with anti-EGFR antibody, and the other half was immunoblotted with anti-c-Src antibody. c-Src and PI 3-Kinase Assays—To check the role of OPN in regulation of c-Src kinase activity, both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN at 37 °C for 0–30 min. In separate experiments, cells were pretreated with anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody (20 μg/ml), GRGDSP (10 μm), or GRGESP (10 μm) for 1 h and then treated with 5 μm OPN at 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were lysed in Src lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm orthovanadate, 10 mg/ml pepstatin, 2.5 mm EDTA), and the lysates were used for c-Src kinase assay as described (43Shih W.L.

Briefly, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Src antibody. Half of the immunocomplex was incubated with kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MnCl2) containing 0.2 μg of acid-denatured enolase, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μm ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The remaining half of the immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blot using anti-c-Src antibody. In separate experiments, both these cells were either pretreated with pp2 (2 nm) or transfected with dn c-Src and then treated with OPN. These treated or transfected cells were used for PI 3-kinase assay as described previously (15Das R. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol.

Hota C. Wilson S.M. Chambers A.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN for 0–60 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase assay buffer at 30 °C for 10 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The remaining half of the immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by Western blot using anti-EGFR antibody. Nuclear Extracts and Western Blot—To check the level of c-Fos expression in the nucleus, both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN for 0–4 h at 37 °C. The nuclear extracts were prepared as described (15Das R. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Kundu G.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were incubated in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and allowed to swell on ice for 10 min. Cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were separated by spinning at 3300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was extracted in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used as nuclear extract. The protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The nuclear extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the level of c-Fos was detected by Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody. EMSA—Both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 μm OPN for 0–4 h at 37 °C. The nuclear extracts were prepared as described above and incubated with 16 fmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded AP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-CGC TTG ATG ACT CAG CCG GAA-3′) in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl) containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The DNA-protein complex was resolved on a native polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. For supershift assay, the OPN-treated nuclear extracts from MDA-MB-231 cells were individually incubated with anti-c-Fos or anti-c-Jun antibody for 30 min at room temperatu"

Recently a family of presenilin homologs was identified. One member of this family, signal peptide peptidase (SPP), has been shown to be a protease, which supports the hypothesis that PS and presenilin homologs are related intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl proteases. SPP has been reported as a glycoprotein of ∼45 kDa. Our initial characterization of SPP isolated from human brain and cell lines demonstrated that SPP is primarily present as an SDS-stable ∼95-kDa protein on Western blots. Upon heating or treatment of this ∼95-kDa SPP band with acid, a ∼45-kDa band could be resolved. Co-purification of two different epitope-tagged forms of SPP from a stably transfected cell line expressing both tagged versions demonstrated that the ∼95-kDa band is a homodimer of SPP. Pulse-chase metabolic labeling studies demonstrated that the SPP homodimer assembles rapidly and is metabolically stable. In a glycerol velocity gradient, SPP sedimented from ∼100–200 kDa. Significantly the SPP homodimer was specifically labeled by an active site-directed photoaffinity probe (III-63) for PS, indicating that the active sites of SPP and PS/γ-secretase are similar and providing strong evidence that the homodimer is functionally active. Collectively these data suggest that SPP exists in vivo as a functional dimer. Presenilin (PS) is the presumptive catalytic component of the intramembrane aspartyl protease γ-secretase complex.

PSs are integral membrane proteins with multiple membrane-spanning domains that are thought to be the catalytic components of a high molecular mass complex referred to as γ-secretase that carries out intramembrane cleavage of multiple type I integral membrane proteins (3Golde T.E.

Because γ-secretase catalyzes the final cleavage that releases amyloid β from its precursor protein, it is a target of emerging Alzheimer's disease therapeutic compounds (3Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

Moreover mutation of either of two conserved aspartates present in adjacent transmembrane domain results in dominant negative PSs that inhibit γ-secretase activity (14Wolfe M.S. Xia W.M. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Despite these recent advances in the understanding of γ-secretase, the multiprotein complex mediating this activity poses significant problems for studies that would inevitably lead to a more definitive structural and mechanistic understanding of this protease. Although the identification of additional members of the γ-secretase complex has enabled reconstitution of γ-secretase activity in a heterologous system (15Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), to date the active complex has not been purified to homogeneity. Shortly after the identification of human PSs, close homologs were recognized in plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Some of these homologs such as those found in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila have been extensively studied and shown to function in high molecular mass complexes like human PSs (for a review, see Ref. 16Golde T.E. Eckman C.B. Sci. STKE. 2003; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/172/re4PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, other proteins with less obvious homology to PSs have been recognized by data base searching (17Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 18Ponting C.P. Hutton M. Nyborg A. Baker M. Jansen K. Golde T.E. Hum. Mol.

Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2002; 67: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These proteins have been referred to by various names. Herein they will be referred to as presenilin homologs/signal peptide peptidase (SPP). All of these proteins are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with multiple membrane-spanning regions and contain both the conserved transmembrane aspartates and the PAL motif near the COOH terminus (16Golde T.E. Eckman C.B. Sci. STKE. 2003; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/172/re4PubMed Google Scholar, 20Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Shortly after its initial in silico identification, one of the presenilin homologs/SPP was identified as an aspartyl I-CliP (17Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This protein has been termed signal peptide peptidase as it has been shown to carry out the intramembrane cleavage of signal peptides of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and hepatitis C virus polyprotein following the initial cleavage of these type II membrane proteins by signal peptidase. SPP-mediated cleavage of major histocompatibility complex class I appears to play an important role in normal immune surveillance as HLA E epitopes are produced from the signal peptide of major histocompatibility complex class I by SPP cleavage (21Lemberg M.K. Bland F.A. Weihofen A. Braud V.M. Martoglio B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6441-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These epitopes are presented to natural killer cells at the cell surface. Such presentation is thought to indicate that the probed cell is healthy (22Karre K. Hansson M. Kiessling R. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 343-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SPP cleavage of an internal signal sequence in the hepatitis C virus polyprotein appears to be essential for proper maturation of the viral core protein. SPP was originally identified using an inhibitor labeling approach with a compound termed TBL4K, which is a photoaffinity probe, based on an inhibitor of SPP activity, (Z-LL)2-ketone (17Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In contrast to human PS1, human SPP activity can be reconstituted in yeast without co-expression of other protein cofactors. Moreover mutation of the second of the conserved transmembrane aspartates (Asp-265) does not alter labeling with TBL4K but does block catalytic activity. More recent studies demonstrate that some γ-secretase inhibitors can inhibit SPP activity and that relatively high concentrations of (Z-LL)2-ketone SPP inhibitors can inhibit γ-secretase activity (23Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A. Paganetti P. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16528-16533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Kornilova A.Y. Das C. Wolfe M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16470-16473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although the topography of SPP has not been definitively established, some evidence suggests that the transmembrane regions containing the proposed catalytic aspartates have an inverted topology relative to PS. If true, this topology would be consistent with the cleavage of type II membrane proteins by SPP and type I membrane proteins by PS (17Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Collectively these bioinformatic and experimental studies of SPP and PS1 support the notion that these proteins are members of a family of biomedically important aspartyl I-CliPs. Because both enzymes are potential targets for therapeutic intervention, PS for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and SPP for anti-hepatitis C virus therapy, it will be important to identify compounds and conditions for the selective inhibition of each protease. In the present study, we set out to characterize a ∼95-kDa species of SPP. Intact SPP is theoretically a ∼42-kDa protein that, when N-glycosylated, has been reported to migrate at ∼45 kDa (17Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that the ∼95-kDa species is a homodimer and that the vast majority of SPP in mammalian cells and brain exists in this dimeric form. This dimer was SDS-stable but was partially heat- and acid-labile. Significantly a photoactivable active site-directed γ-secretase inhibitor specifically labeled the dimeric form of SPP. These results suggest that SPP functions as a homodimer and provide additional evidence that the active sites of SPP and PS are structurally similar. SPP Constructs—Full-length SPP was cloned by amplifying a 1134-bp sequence from a human brain cDNA library. The wild type SPP cDNA contains the entire coding sequence of SPP and 17 bases of 5′ untranslated sequence and 10 bases of 3′ untranslated sequence and was cloned into HindIII (5′) and XbaI (3′) sites of the pAG3 expression vector (25Murphy M.P.

Full-length SPP was also cloned into the pcDNA6-V5-his vector (Invitrogen) to generate a carboxyl-terminally V5 + His6 epitope-tagged SPP (SPP-CTV5his) and into pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma) to generate an amino-terminally FLAG epitope-tagged SPP (SPP-NTFLAG). In SPP-CTV5his, SPP was cloned into HindIII (5′) and XbaI (3′) of cDNA6-V5-his vector such that a vector-derived six-amino acid spacer (SRGPFE) exists between the end of the SPP coding sequence and the V5 tag. In SPP-NTFLAG, full-length SPP was cloned into the HindIII (5′) and XhoI (3′) sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 such that a vector-derived three-amino acid spacer (LLA) separates the FLAG tag from the amino terminus of SPP. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Generation of Pooled Stable Lines—Chinese hamster ovary, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK), or human neuroglioma (H4) cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA preincubated with 8 μl of Fu-GENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) in serum-free OptiMEM (Invitrogen) overnight. Media were then replaced with either Ham's F-12 (Chinese hamster ovary cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HEK cells and H4 cells) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 2.5 μg/ml blasticidin S (Calbiochem). Following selection, greater than 500 colonies were observed in each pooled stable line. Expression levels were monitored periodically by immunoblotting throughout the course of the experiments and remained stable through multiple passages. The HEK cell line that co-expresses the SPP-CTV5his and SPP-NTFLAG constructs was made by mixing 2 μg of SPP-NTFLAG and 0.2 μg of the SPP-CTV5his DNA in the transfection mixture. Stable cell lines were selected by selecting for blasticidin S encoded by pCDNA-6-SPPCTV5his. Cell lines were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Antibodies, Western Blotting, and Immunostaining—Anti-peptide antisera were raised in rabbits to the amino- (anti-SPPnt, residues 1–20) and carboxyl (anti-SPPct, residues 358–377)-terminal domains of human SPP (Covance). Peptides corresponding to these domains of SPP were synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin prior to immunization. Lysates were prepared by lysis in either 2% CHAPSO in 50 mm HEPES (CHAPSO) and 1× Complete PI or 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline with 1× Complete PI (TX-100). Except where indicated in the figure legends, sample loading buffer was added to each sample such that the sample contained a final concentration of 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were run on 10–20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then transblotted to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Blots were probed with rabbit anti-SPPct at a 1:1000 dilution to detect the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of SPP or rabbit anti-SPPnt at a 1:1000 dilution to detect the amino-terminal 20 amino acids of SPP. PS1 was detected with a 1:1000 mixture of antibodies that detect PS1 CTF (PS490, gifts of E. Koo) and PS1 amino terminus (852B3). Anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and anti-FLAG (Sigma) were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Peptide preabsorption was performed by adding excess peptide dissolved in water and incubating it for 1 h at 37 °C. The preabsorbed anti-serum was then centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 2 min. Trichloroacetic Acid Precipitation—Trichloroacetic acid precipitation was performed as described previously (17Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Briefly 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to sucrose gradient fractionation samples. Samples were then centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Pellets were washed twice in acetone and then allowed to dry. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5% CHAPSO, 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 1× PI. Immunocytochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was carried out as described previously (26Lah J.J. Levey A.I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly HEK cells coexpressing SPP-CTV5his and SPP-NTFLAG were plated on 4-well chamber slides. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized in 0.05% saponin. Anti-V5 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:500 dilution, and anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal (Sigma) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (568) and goat anti-mouse IgG (488) were used sequentially at a 1:2000 dilution. Imaging was performed on a confocal Olympus microscope with Fluoview software system. Ni2+ Affinity Purification—HEK cells (one to two confluent 150-mm plates) stably expressing the SPP-CTV5his construct were lysed in CHAPSO lysis buffer with 1× EDTA-free PI. Lysates were centrifuged at 3220 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was diluted to 1% CHAPSO, 50 mm HEPES, and 20 mm imidazole and rocked with 100 μl of nickel NTA slurry overnight at 4 °C. Nickel NTA beads (Qiagen) were washed two times in 50 bed volumes of cold 50 mm HEPES, 1% CHAPSO, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 1× EDTA-free PI. Two consecutive elutions were collected in 50 mm HEPES, 1% CHAPSO, 150 mm NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. All buffers were at pH 7 and had 1× EDTA-free PI. Gradient Fractionation—Sucrose gradients were run as described previously (27Wahrle S. Das P. Nyborg A.C. McLendon C. Shoji M. Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Younkin S.G. Golde T.E. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 9: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Glycerol velocity gradients were run as described previously (28Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y. Duthie M. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16470-16475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Briefly HEK wild type (wt) or HEK cells stably expressing the SPP-CTV5his construct (five confluent 150-mm plates) were lysed in either CHAPSO or TX-100. Lysates were spun at 3220 × g to remove nuclei, insoluble material, and cellular debris, and 1 ml of supernatant was loaded on to the top of an 11-ml 10–40% linear glycerol gradient with either 0.5% CHAPSO, 150 mm NaCl, and 25 mm HEPES or 0.1% TX-100 in Tris-buffered saline. The samples were then centrifuged in an SW 41 rotor for 15 h at 110,000 × g at 4 °C. One-milliliter fractions were collected from the top and analyzed by SDS-PAGE for SPP or PS1 proteins. Control gradients were prepared identically but included a combination of commercially available, characterized, molecular mass standards (Serva). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of SPP—HEK wt or SPP-CTV5his stably expressing cells were labeled for 2 h with 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine. SPP was immunoprecipitated with either anti-SPPnt or anti-V5 antibodies from TX-100 lysates. Each analysis was performed in duplicate. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 10–20% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad). Phosphorimaging analysis of the dried gels was performed. ImageQuant was used to quantitate the SPP in each sample and determine the half-life of SPP. Covalent Labeling of SPP by Photoactivable and Biotinylated Active Site-directed γ-Secretase Inhibitor—Photoprobe III-63 and analog III-31-C were synthesized as described previously (29Esler W.P. Das C. Campbell W.A. Kimberly W.T. Kornilova A.Y. Diehl T.S. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E110-E112Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The photolabeling was performed as described previously (24Kornilova A.Y. Das C. Wolfe M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16470-16473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly 500 nm compound III-63 was incubated with CHAPSO lysates for 1 h in the absence or presence of a parent compound, III-31-C (20 μm), or an SPP inhibitor, (Z-LL)2-ketone (1 μm). Samples were irradiated for 45 min at 350 nm. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated with immobilized streptavidin and detected by SDS-PAGE using anti-V5 antibody for SPP-CTV5his-expressing cells or anti-SPPct antibody for the endogenous SPP in wt cells. Antibodies to SPP Recognize an ∼95-kDa Band—Anti-peptide antisera were raised in rabbits to the amino (anti-SPPnt, residues 1–20) and carboxyl (anti-SPPct, residues 358–377) terminal domains of human SPP. Both of these antibodies recognized a band of ∼95 kDa in human brain and in human cell lines indicating that this band is likely to contain full-length SPP (Fig. 1a). In HEK and H4 cells, a second band of ∼45 kDa was also recognized by both anti-SPP antibodies (Fig. 1, a and d). In human brain, this band was not detected by either antibody even upon longer exposure (not shown). Preabsorption of the antibody with peptide completely blocked detection of both the ∼95- and ∼45-kDa bands (Fig. 1a), and neither band was present in preimmune sera (Fig. 1d). Variability in the relative amounts of the two bands could be seen depending on how the sample was handled post-lysis. For example, samples that had been manipulated for long periods of time (Ni2+ affinity purification or overnight fractionation) or heated excessively had more of the ∼45-kDa band relative to the ∼95-kDa band (e.g. Fig. 1d). Although in most lysates the ∼95-kDa band was always present, lower and more variable levels of the ∼45-kDa band were seen. The ∼95-kDa species was observed from lysates of cells that stably overexpress SPP with a V5 and His6 epitope tag at its COOH terminus (SPP-CTV5his) or a FLAG epitope tag at the NH2 terminus (SPP-NTFLAG) (Fig. 1b). The COOH-terminal V5his tag on SPP was placed at the very COOH terminus after the putative KKXX endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal. In some cases, placement of an epitope tag beyond the endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal can alter the fate of the protein. With SPP, we found no evidence for any effect of the epitope tags on the characteristics of the protein that we analyzed in this study. Except for expected shifts in molecular mass, identical results were obtained with COOH-terminally tagged SPP, NH2-terminally tagged SPP, and endogenous SPP. Upon longer exposure of the blots, a minor ∼45-kDa band was also detected by anti-V5 and anti-FLAG antibodies in immunoblots of SPP-CTV5his-transfected HEK or SPP-NTFLAG-transfected HEK cells (not shown). Ni2+ affinity purification of SPP-CTV5his from HEK cells stably expressing this protein resulted in purification of a ∼45- and a ∼95-kDa band (Fig. 1c). Both ∼45- and ∼95-kDa bands were detected by the anti-SPPnt and anti-SPPct antibodies in SPP lysates that had a higher relative proportion of the ∼45-kDa species than typically seen; nevertheless these results again demonstrated that each band contained full-length SPP (Fig. 1d). The Ni2+ affinity-purified ∼95-kDa band was recognized by both anti-SPPnt and anti-SPPct antibodies demonstrating that the antibodies were recognizing both tagged and untagged versions of SPP (Fig. 1e). Notably the flow-through of the Ni2+ affinity purification had a significant amount of untagged SPP, as detected by anti-SPPnt and anti-SPPct antibodies, that was not purified and ran at a slightly lower molecular mass relative to the eluted SPP-CTV5his (Fig. 1e, lane 2 versus lanes 3 and 4). SPP Is an SDS-stable Dimer—Based on these immunoblotting results, we postulated that the ∼95-kDa form of SPP is either an SDS-stable complex with another protein or a homodimer. To investigate the relationship between the two forms we conducted several experiments. First we attempted to dissociate the ∼95-kDa form using various detergents for lysis. Lysis of HEK cells that overexpress SPP-CTV5his in 1% Triton X-100, 2% CHAPSO, 0.1% SDS, 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, or 6 m urea did not significantly alter the relative levels of the ∼95- and ∼45-kDa bands detected after immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibody (not shown). In all instances, the ∼95-kDa band was the predominant species. To obtain partially purified SPP, we performed sucrose gradient fractionation and collected the buoyant fractions 4 and 5, which contained detergent-resistant membranes and associated proteins. We reported previously that these detergent-resistant membranes contain γ-secretase activity (27Wahrle S. Das P. Nyborg A.C. McLendon C. Shoji M. Kawarabayashi T. Younkin L.H. Younkin S.G. Golde T.E. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 9: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Like PS1, SPP was enriched in these detergent-resistant membranes as well (not shown). Using the detergent-resistant membranes, we performed a number of experiments to determine whether we could disassociate the ∼95-kDa band into the smaller 45-kDa band. Heating the sample without loading buffer did very little to the ratio of the 45- to 95-kDa bands (Fig. 2a, lane 2). However, heating the sample at 65 °C for 20 min after loading buffer (SDS and β-mercaptoethanol) was added made a large difference in the amount of the 45-kDa band relative to the 95-kDa band. Additionally trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the sample generated large quantities of the 45-kDa species (Fig. 2a, lane 4). The combination of trichloroacetic acid precipitation and heating at 65 °C for 20 min after loading buffer was added caused all the ∼95-kDa species to be converted to the ∼45-kDa species (Fig. 2a, lane 5). These are the same conditions (trichloroacetic acid precipitation and heated Western samples) that Weihofen et al. (17Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) used when SPP was initially characterized as a ∼45-kDa protein. Integral membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains are often difficult to recover if cell lysates are heated excessively prior to SDS-PAGE; therefore, in the experiments shown previously, the lysates were only heated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to gel loading. To further determine whether heating alters the relative levels of the two bands observed for SPP, we altered the incubation temperature of TX-100 lysates prior to PAGE. These results showed that as SPP-CTV5his-overexpressing HEK cell lysates were heated from 37 to 65 °C for 20 min, the amount of the ∼95-kDa species decreased, and the ∼45-kDa species increased (Fig. 2b). Above 65 °C the amount of both species decreased, and high molecular mass aggregates became predominant (Fig. 2b). Lysates heated above 85 °C contained primarily an aggregated species that barely entered the gel at all (not shown). Similar results were obtained for CHAPSO-lysed SPP-CTV5his-overexpressing HEK cells, TX-100-lysed SPP-NTFLAG-overexpressing HEK cells, and endogenous SPP in HEK cells (not shown). To confirm that the ∼45-kDa species was a product of the heated ∼95-kDa species, CHAPSO lysates from HEK cells stably overexpressing SPP-CTV5his were separated by SDS-PAGE, and a gel slice in the 90–100-kDa m"

The smaller flavin reductase PheA2 component catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of free FAD according to a ping-pong bisubstrate-biproduct mechanism. The reduced FAD is then used by the larger oxygenase component PheA1 to hydroxylate phenols to the corresponding catechols. We have determined the x-ray structure of PheA2 containing a bound FAD cofactor (2.2 Å), which is the first structure of a member of this flavin reductase family. We have also determined the x-ray structure of reduced holo-PheA2 in complex with oxidized NAD (2.1 Å). PheA2 is a single domain homodimeric protein with each FAD-containing subunit being organized around a six-stranded β-sheet and a capping α-helix. The tightly bound FAD prosthetic group (Kd = 10 nm) binds near the dimer interface, and the re face of the FAD isoalloxazine ring is fully exposed to solvent. The addition of NADH to crystalline PheA2 reduced the flavin cofactor, and the NAD product was bound in a wide solvent-accessible groove adopting an unusual folded conformation with ring stacking. This is the first observation of an enzyme that is very likely to react with a folded compact pyridine nucleotide. The PheA2 crystallographic models strongly suggest that reactive exogenous FAD substrate binds in the NADH cleft after release of NAD product. Nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometry data indeed showed that PheA2 is able to bind one FAD cofactor and one FAD substrate.

The non-enzymatic reduction of free flavins by reduced pyridine nucleotides is known to be a rather slow process. Therefore, microorganisms have evolved flavin reductases (NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductases) that catalyze the reduction of riboflavin, FMN, or FAD by NADH or NADPH (1Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12325-12331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the biological function of reduced flavins is not well understood, it is suggested that they play an important role as redox mediators in iron uptake and metabolism in prokaryotes or in light emission in the bioluminescence reaction of bacteria (2Coves J. Fontecave M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Jeffers C.E. Tu S.-C.

On the basis of amino acid sequences we can distinguish three subgroups of flavin reductases. Members of the first class are found in Escherichia coli and luminous bacteria, like Vibrio fischeri and Vibrio harveyi (5Ingelman M. Ramaswamy S. Nivière V. Fontecave M. Eklund H.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7040-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In recent years, a third class of flavin reductases has been identified, whose members act in combination with a flavin-dependent oxygenase for oxidation of the substrate by molecular oxygen (8Kendrew S.G.

In the case of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase the reductase and oxygenase components do not need to interact for the hydroxylation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (12Gálan B. Diaz E.

Very recent biochemical data have shown that PheA2 catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of free flavins according to a ping-pong bisubstrate-biproduct catalytic mechanism (15Kirchner U. Westphal A.H. Muller R. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47545-47553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The formed reduced flavins react with PheA1 to catalyze the ortho-hydroxylation of simple phenols into the corresponding catechols. To date, no structural information is available for any of the members of the two-component flavoprotein monooxygenase family. PheA2 homologues share weak amino acid sequence identity (>20%) with the archaeal ferric reductase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (19Vadas A. Monbouquette H.G. Johnson E. Schröder I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36715-36721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) from which the x-ray structure has recently been determined (20Chiu H.-J. Johnson E. Schröder I. Rees D.C. Structure. 2001; 9: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the flavin-mediated reduction of ferric iron complexes using NAD(P)H as electron donor. Both biochemical and structural data have shown that the flavin substrate binds only weakly to the enzyme. Intriguingly, ferric reductase uses its single domain to bind both FMN and NAD(P)H and does not contain the Rossmann fold to bind the NAD(P)H molecule (20Chiu H.-J. Johnson E. Schröder I. Rees D.C. Structure. 2001; 9: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here, we present three-dimensional structures of flavin reductase PheA2 from B. thermoglucosidasius A7 in complex with FAD (2.2 Å) and in complex with reduced FAD and NAD (2.1 Å) solved by x-ray crystallography. The bound NAD product adopts an unusual folded conformation in PheA2. On the basis of these crystallographic data and additional electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and fluorescence binding studies we conclude that flavin reductase PheA2 contains a flavin cofactor and an additional binding groove for binding NADH and flavin substrate, which alternate during catalysis. These structural data fully support the proposed ping-pong bisubstrate-biproduct mechanism of action. Protein Expression, Purification, and Analytical and Crystallization Procedures—The pheA2 gene from B. thermoglucosidasius A7 encoding PheA2 was overexpressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium in the absence of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described previously (16Duffner F.M. Kirchner U. Bauer M.P. Müller R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). To obtain the selenomethionine-substituted PheA2, the pheA2 gene was transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (16Duffner F.M. Kirchner U. Bauer M.P. Müller R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To favor the production of selenomethionine-substituted protein, the biosynthesis of native protein was blocked by using growth medium without l-methionine. Specifically, E. coli containing the pheA2 gene was grown in a minimal M9 medium (8 g/liter dibasic sodium phosphate, 4 g/liter monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.5 g/liter sodium chloride, and 0.5 g/liter ammonium chloride, pH 7.4) (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1988Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 mg/liter l-amino acids except l-methionine, 100 mg/liter seleno-dl-methionine, 0.1 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm magnesium sulfate, 1 mm thiamine, 2 g/liter glucose, 1 mg/liter riboflavin, 1 mg/liter niacinamide, 1 mg/liter pyridoxin, and 75 mg/liter ampicillin. The E. coli cells were grown at 30 °C for 2 days in the absence of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Native PheA2 and selenomethionine-substituted PheA2 were purified according to the procedure established by Kirchner et al. (15Kirchner U. Westphal A.H. Muller R. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47545-47553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. E. coli cells were resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 0.5 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mg DNase, pH 7.0. After disruption of the cells by sonication and removal of cell debris, the protein sample was treated with 0.5% (w/v) protamine sulfate followed by the addition of 1.4 m ammonium sulfate. The protein was then loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (10 × 2.6 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 1.3 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. PheA2 was eluted with a linear descending gradient from 1.3 to 0.4 m ammonium sulfate and dialyzed against the sodium phosphate buffer without ammonium sulfate. The dialyzed protein sample was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (10 × 2.6 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. PheA2 was eluted with a linear ascending gradient from 0 to 0.6 m NaCl. The protein was then loaded onto a preparative Superdex 75 (60 × 1.6 cm) column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. Pure PheA2 fractions were pooled and frozen at -80 °C. PheA2 apoprotein was prepared by treating the enzyme with 2.5 m guanidinium hydrochloride in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The FAD prosthetic group was removed by eluting the protein sample over a Biogel P-6 DG size-exclusion chromatography column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 2.5 m guanidium hydrochloride, pH 7.0. All analytical experiments were performed in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on an SLM-Aminco SPF 500C fluorescence spectrophotometer. Dissociation constants of apoenzyme·flavin complexes were determined from fluorescence titration experiments with excitation set at 450 nm. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy experiments were performed on a home-built fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with two photomultipliers arranged in T-format (Thorn EMI 9863QA/350, operating in photon-counting detection mode) as described previously (23Engel M.F. van Mierlo C.P.M. Visser A.J.W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10922-10930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NADH oxidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in absorption of NADH at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1) at 40 °C. The assay mixture routinely contained 0.2 mm NADH and 0.01 mm FAD. To determine the specificity of the reaction, FMN, riboflavin, and NADPH were also tested as substrates. Absorption spectra were recorded using a Hewlett Packard 8453 diode-array spectrophotometer. For nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometry experiments 4 μm PheA2 was prepared in aqueous 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, and mixed with different concentrations of FAD in the same buffer. The protein was introduced in a nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometer coupled to an orthogonal time-of-flight analyzer operating in positive ion mode (Micromass LC-T, Waters). The electrospray voltages applied were optimized for optimal transmission of the PheA2 ions (capillary voltage 1300-1350 V and cone voltage 60 V). Borosilicate glass capillaries (Kwik-Fil, World Precision Instruments) were used on a P-97 puller (Sutter Instruments) to prepare the nanoflow electrospray capillaries with an orifice of about 5 μm. The capillaries were subsequently coated with a thin gold layer using an Edwards Scancoat six Pirani 501 sputter coater (Edwards High Vacuum International). Crystals of PheA2 were grown at 20 °C by the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method. The hanging drops contained 4 μl of an equal mixture of protein solution (16 mg/ml PheA2 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) and reservoir solution (20-26% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.4 m magnesium nitrate). Hanging drops were allowed to equilibrate against 1 ml of reservoir solution for several days. Bright yellow crystals appeared with overall dimensions of 0.5 × 0.4 × 0.1 mm. NAD-complexed enzyme was prepared by soaking the enzyme crystals in the reservoir solution containing 5 mm NADH for 1 h at 20 °C. Bleaching of the FAD cofactor indicated that NADH reacted with the crystalline enzyme resulting in the accumulation of reduced FAD in the crystals. X-ray Data Collection and Processing—PheA2 crystals were cryocooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen, and x-ray data were collected at 100 K using a nitrogen stream. Cryoprotection was accomplished by placing the PheA2 crystals for a few s in a cryoprotectant solution (26% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.4 m magnesium nitrate, and 25% (w/v) glycerol). Data from the selenomethionine-substituted PheA2 were collected on beamline BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) using a MarCCD detector. The two data sets (at 0.97917 and 0.88570 nm for peak and remote, respectively) were processed using MOSFLM (24Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and the CCP4 suite of programs (25Collaborative Computational Project Number 4. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The selenomethionine PheA2 crystals belong to space group P21 with eight protein chains in the asymmetric unit. Structure Determination, Model Building, and Refinement—The initial sites of the anomalous scattering atoms were found using the program ShelxD (26Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) using the peak data. ShelxD detected 48 atoms, corresponding to eight monomers (8 × 6 selenomethionines including the N-terminal selenomethionine residue)/asymmetric unit. The initial sites were refined and employed in phasing using the program ShelxE (26Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The phases were further improved by 8-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging and solvent flattening using the program DM (27Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density map was of excellent quality.

Following the standard protocol suggested by the authors, a total of 1151 of 1224 peptides were traced (94%). The subsequent refinement of this initial model consisted of alternating rounds of manual fitting of the model to electron density maps using the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W.

The water molecules were removed prior to refinement calculations. The initial map showed very clear electron density for NAD bound in a folded conformation. After rigid-body refinement, the structure of NADH-soaked PheA2 was refined as described for native PheA2. The final model consists of a total of 1224 residues, eight reduced FAD cofactors, eight NAD molecules, and 397 water molecules. 92.4% of the amino acids are in the core region of the Ramachandran plot (32Laskowski R.A.

https://openalex.org/W1970924996,"In addition to the generation from specific nitric-oxide (NO) synthases, NO formation from nitrite occurs in ischemic tissues, such as the heart. Although NO binding to heme-centers is the basis for NO-mediated signaling as occurs through guanylate cyclase, it is not known if this process is triggered with physiologically relevant periods of sublethal ischemia and if nitrite serves as a critical substrate. Therefore electron paramagnetic resonance studies were performed to measure nitrosylheme formation during the time course of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion and the role of nitrite in this process. Rat hearts were either partially nitrite-depleted by nitrite-free buffer perfusion or nitrite-enriched by preinfusion with 50 μm nitrite. Ischemic hearts loaded with nitrite showed prominent spectra of six-coordinate nitrosyl-heme complexes, primarily NO-myoglobin, that increased as a function of ischemic duration, whereas in nonischemic-controls these signals were not seen. Total nitrosyl-heme concentrations within the heart were 6.6 ± 0.7 μm after 30 min of ischemia. Nitrite-depleted hearts also gave rise to NO-heme signals during ischemia, but levels were 8-fold lower. Nitrite-mediated NO-heme complex formation during ischemia was associated with activation of guanylate cyclase. Upon reperfusion, the levels of NO-heme complexes decreased 3-fold by the first 15 min but remained elevated for over 45 min. The decrease in NO-heme complex levels was paralleled by the formation of nitrate, suggesting the oxidation of heme-bound NO upon reperfusion. Thus, nitrite-mediated NO-heme formation occurs progressively during ischemia, with these complexes serving as a store of NO with concordant activation of NO signaling pathways.

Nitric oxide (NO), an inorganic free radical, is a biologically important signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes, including vasodilatation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, neurotransmission, and cytotoxic host defense (1Moncada S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Increased intracellular NO formation during and following ischemia has been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion injury (2Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol.

In both the heart and the brain, extensive studies have definitively demonstrated markedly increased NO formation as well as the critical role of this excessive NO in the tissue damage after an ischemic event (2Zweier J.L.

It has been observed that NO reacts with superoxide to form the potent oxidant peroxynitrite that results in protein nitration and cellular injury (7Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J.

However, studies over the last several years have also demonstrated additional pathways and mechanisms for NO synthesis in biological tissues. Within ischemic tissues in particular, it has been shown that NOS/l-arginine-independent pathways of NO formation occur (10Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat.

These are dependent on the reduction or disproportionation of the substrate nitrite, and with increasing periods of ischemia, where there is increasingly severe hypoxia and acidosis, these NOS-independent pathways become the major source of tissue NO production (10Zweier J.L.

The mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as other heme protein-containing reductase systems may also reduce nitrite, NO2-, to NO (21Kozlov A.V. Staniek K. Nohl H.

Pol. 2000; 47: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The major biochemical mechanism by which NO exerts its signaling roles in the cardiovascular system is through its binding to heme proteins (23Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase, sGC, by binding to its heme moiety, leading to the production of cGMP. cGMP is then responsible though activation of kinases for a reduction of calcium influx within the cells, leading to vasorelaxation (24Hobbs A.J. Ignarro L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 134-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life of NO in vivo typically varies from seconds to a few hundred milliseconds in tissues and is pO2-dependent (25Lewis R.S. Deen W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1994; 7: 568-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). When bound to heme moieties, it forms highly stable ferrous nitrosyl-heme complexes whose distinctive spectra have been proposed to serve as a quantitative measure of NO generation (26Komarov A.

In prior studies we have observed the formation of five coordinate nitrosyl-heme complexes derived primarily from myoglobin, Mb, but only in necrotic heart muscle after very long periods of ischemia (10Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). These complexes have axial symmetry and a characteristic triplet splitting due to the hyperfine coupling of the nitrogen nucleus of the heme-bound NO. Up to the present time, however, intrinsic nitrosyl-heme complex formation has not been observed during short sublethal periods of ischemia, and it had been thought that these complexes would not accumulate in significant quantities except under the near anoxic conditions that occur with prolonged global ischemia (2Zweier J.L. Wang P. Kuppusamy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 304-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 10Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat.

Pharmacol. 2001; 37: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study we observe that with short periods of ischemia nitrite-derived nitrosyl-heme complex formation occurs and progressively increases as a function of ischemic duration. Upon reperfusion, levels of these complexes decline but remain elevated for prolonged periods. The magnitude and time course of this process is directly detected and characterized by EPR spectroscopy. It is shown that these nitrosyl-heme complexes have an important role as a store and mediator of NO-derived signaling. Materials—Potassium iodide reagent ACS was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. Vanadium (III) chloride was obtained from Aldrich. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline was obtained form Invitrogen. Hydrochloric acid was purchased from Fisher. cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Sodium [15N]nitrite was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). All the other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Isolated Heart Perfusion—Female Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were heparinized and anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital. The hearts were excised, and the aorta was cannulated. Hearts were perfused at a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg using Krebs bicarbonate buffer (17 mm glucose, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2) bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas at 37 °C. A sidearm in the perfusion line allowed direct infusion of NaNO2 just proximal to the heart. To measure contractile function, a latex balloon was inserted into the left ventricular cavity and connected to a pressure transducer via a hydraulic line, and pressure was recorded with a Gould RS4000 recorder. The balloon was initially inflated to achieve an end-diastolic pressure of 8–14 mm Hg. Left ventricular pressure, heart rate, and coronary flow were monitored throughout the period of perfusion. Isolated hearts were initially perfused for 15 min to enable stabilization of contractile function and then subjected to given durations of 37 °C global ischemia or ischemia followed by reperfusion. At the desired time points, hearts were rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen-cooled Wollenberger tongs. The frozen tissue was maintained at 77 K in liquid nitrogen and fractured to 2–3-mm pieces and placed directly into an EPR finger Dewar. The EPR Dewar was filled to a sufficient height to fill the critical volume of the EPR cavity. EPR Spectroscopy—Tissue was fractured to a particle size of ∼2–3 mm and placed directly into the Dewar that was inserted into a TM110 cavity of Bruker ER300 spectrometer operating at X-band. EPR spectra were recorded at 77 K using liquid nitrogen. The EPR spectra were obtained as an average of 10 scans with sweep time of 60 s with a modulation amplitude of 3.98 G, modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and 5.0 milliwatts of microwave power at a frequency of 9.786 GHz. Quantitation of the total radical concentration in the tissue was determined from the ratio of the double integral of the observed signal to that of a myoglobin-NO standard of known concentration measured using identical EPR parameters. The relative ratios of the component signals were determined using a computer program designed to provide a best fit of the observed spectrum from a linear combination of the component signals. The component signals used were obtained from computer simulation of the components obtained on temperature annealing the tissue in a manner similar to that reported previously using an EPR simulation program for anisotropic systems (31Zweier J.L. Flaherty J.T. Weisfeldt M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Both of these programs were run on Pentium PCs. The EPR data files were directly imported into the fitting program. Chemiluminescence NO Analyzer—A Sievers 270B nitric oxide analyzer was used to measure nitrite and nitrate levels and was interfaced though a DT2821 A to D board to a PC as described previously (12Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 32Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using a custom-developed software (ANOMA, automated NOmeasurement and analysis) (12Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 32Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The concentration of nitrite was determined by quantitative transformation of nitrite to NO performed using the reducing agent KI (1%) under acidic conditions (1 n HCl) in a glass-purging vessel equipped with a heating jacket. Measurement of the NO released into the gas phase was performed by measurement of the light emitted from the chemiluminescence reaction of NO with ozone in the analyzer. Quantification of nitrite was performed by comparison of NO release from standard solutions of nitrite to that from the assay samples (33Garside C. Mar. Chem. 1982; 11: 159-167Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The concentrations of nitrate and nitrite, collectively, were determined using a reaction mixture consisting of 1% VCl3 in 2 n HCl at 90 °C. From the difference of the values obtained from this latter assay and that for nitrite the concentrations of nitrate were calculated. cGMP Assay—cGMP was determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay using a kit from Amersham Biosciences according to the manufacture's specification. Briefly, hearts were freeze-clamped, and 300 mg of tissue was extracted in 6% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. Trichloroacetic acid was removed by diethyl ether (4 washes; 1 ml of extract, 12 ml of diethyl ether was used per each wash), and the samples were dried under nitrogen flow at 60 °C. After appropriate dilution the samples were subjected to enzyme immunoassay utilizing a standard curve prepared with known amount of cGMP (curve range, 2–512 fmol/well). Standards—Nitrosyl-myoglobin standards of were prepared under anaerobic conditions in an argon atmosphere by reacting sodium nitrite with excess horse deoxymyoglobin, 1 mm, in phosphate buffer in the presence of 10 mm hydrosulfite. Samples were frozen at 77 K in a 5-mm diameter cylindrical mold and then processed identically to the tissue with fracturing to a particle size of ∼2–3 mm. These particles were then placed directly in the EPR Dewar for concentration determination. Sodium nitrite solutions were prepared in Krebs buffer immediately before use. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless noted otherwise. The statistical significance of differences between groups was calculated using two-way analysis of variance. p values of <0.05 were considered as significant. Initial experiments were performed to determine whether nitrosyl-heme complexes could be detected in normal and ischemic heart tissue and to determine the role of nitrite in this process. As reported previously, nitrite concentrations in freshly isolated rats hearts are ∼12 ± 5 μm and decrease about 4-fold after isolation and perfusion with nitrite-free perfusate for 15 min, the usual requisite period for stabilization of cardiac function (10Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Intrinsic plasma or tissue concentrations of nitrite have been reported to vary over a wide range from submicromolar values to levels as high as 50 μm (12Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 34Sastry K.V. Moudgal R.P. Mohan J. Tyagi J.S. Rao G.S. Anal.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11482-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Therefore, to evaluate the role of nitrite on nitrosyl-heme complex formation, hearts were either perfused with normal nitrite-free perfusate (nitrite levels < 0.1 μm) or preinfused with 50 μm nitrite for 5 min before the onset of ischemia. After cannulation and a 15-min period for functional stabilization and equilibration of contractile function, developed pressures of >110 mm Hg were observed, and hearts were then infused and loaded with 50 μm NaNO2 for 5 min. The hearts were then immediately freeze-clamped at 77 K or subjected to no-flow ischemia and then frozen. Normally perfused control hearts showed no detectable signal of nitrosyl-heme complexes (Fig. 1A). Only a relatively sharp signal is seen centered at about 3370 Gauss with a g value of 2.004 that has been previously identified as arising primarily from the mitochondrial ubiquinone radical (37Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Lutty G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 38Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Williams R. Rayburn B.K. Smith D. Weisfeldt M.L. Flaherty J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a weak iron sulfur protein signal at about 3500 Gauss with a g value of 1.94 (39Ambrosio G. Zweier J.L. Duilio C. Kuppusamy P. Santoro G. Elia P.P. Tritto I. Cirillo P. Condorelli M. Chiariello M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18532-18541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When hearts not infused with nitrite were subjected to 30 min of ischemia no major nitrosyl-heme signal was seen (Fig. 1B). However, a very prominent nitrosyl-heme signal appeared when hearts preloaded with 50 μm nitrite were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia (Fig. 1C). This broad signal spanning from 3200 to 3500 Gauss appears identical to that of the six coordinate NO-heme complex of NO-Mb that has characteristic g values g1 = 2.08, g2 = 2.01, and g3 = 1.98 as reported previously (40Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3991-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On careful comparison of the spectrum of Fig. 1C to that in 1B, it appears that a small component of the NO-heme signal clearly seen in 1C is also present, contributing to the shoulders seen in 1B over the region from 3250 to 3450 Gauss in the non-nitrite-treated ischemic heart. Experiments were performed to determine the effect of the duration of ischemia on NO-heme complex formation. After 5 min of infusion of 50 μm nitrite, hearts were subjected to periods of global 37 °C ischemia of 0–240 min. As shown in Fig. 2, whereas with control nonischemic hearts infused with nitrite no significant NO-heme signal was observed (Fig. 2, 0′), with even short periods of ischemia of 10 min (Fig. 2, 10′) prominent NO-heme signals were seen that progressively increased as a function of the duration of ischemia. In a matched series of hearts that were also preinfused with the NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (1 mm for 5 min) that would totally block NO formation from NOS, no significant change was seen in the magnitude of NO-heme signals during ischemia. Standard complexes of NO-Mb were prepared to further verify the identity of the observed NO-heme signal and to enable quantitation of these signals in the heart tissue. As can be seen from the inset in Fig. 3, a linear relationship was observed for the EPR signal amplitude and NO-Mb complex concentration. Furthermore, the EPR spectrum of the NO-Mb standard is identical to that of the NO-heme spectrum observed in ischemic heart tissue. This was further verified by computer simulation and fitting of the observed spectra as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the NO-heme (NO-Mb) signals in heart tissue were quantitated. The magnitude of NO-heme formation as a function of ischemic duration was determined from the series of EPR measurements shown in Fig. 2. This graph shows that with nitrite loading prominent NO-Mb complex formation is present even with short periods of ischemia of 10 min with a level of 3.6 μm and rises to values of 6.6 μm at 30 min and 12.7 μm at 240 min. For hearts that were not loaded with nitrite, NO-Mb complex formation was also observed during myocardial ischemia (Fig 4B). In a series of these hearts the levels of NO-Mb also progressively increased as a function of ischemic duration but were about 8–10-fold lower than the nitrite-loaded hearts with concentrations of 0.5 or 1.6 μm after 30 or 240 min, respectively.Fig. 4Time course of Mb-NO complex formation during global 37 °C ischemia. Spectra were recorded at 77 K as described in Fig. 2, and quantification was performed by comparison of the double integral of the signals to that of Mb-NO standards of known concentration as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel A shows the data for hearts loaded with 50 μm nitrite for 5 min before the onset of ischemia, and panel B shows the data for a heart without nitrite loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further experiments were performed to determine the effect of varying myocardial nitrite levels on the magnitude of NO-heme formation during ischemia. NO-heme formation was measured in hearts subjected to 30 min of global ischemia after 5 min of preinfusion with nitrite concentrations in the range of 25–400 μm. With these increasing nitrite loading-dose concentrations a linear correlation was observed between dose and amount of Mb-NO formed from 3.04 ± 0.01 μm in hearts loaded with 25 μm nitrite to 27.0 ± 0.3 μm in hearts with 400 μm nitrite (Fig. 5). To further prove that the observed NO-heme complex formation was derived from nitrite, isotope tracer experiments were performed measuring nitrosyl-heme formation in hearts infused with isotopically labeled [15N]nitrite. Because 15N has a nuclear spin of ½, doublet hyperfine splitting rather than the smaller triplet hyperfine splitting characteristic of natural abundance 14N will be observed. For the six coordinate heme complexes of Mb, although these splittings are not well resolved, the [15N]NO-Mb complex is distinguishable from that with [14N]NO (41Kon H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4350-4357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hearts were labeled with [15N]nitrite or natural abundance [14N]nitrite with a concentration of 250 μm infused for 3 min before the onset of ischemia. With [15N]nitrite labeling, the characteristic centrally split 15NO-Mb spectrum was seen (Fig 6B), whereas with [14N]nitrite the typical 14NO-Mb spectrum was observed (Fig. 6A). Upon reperfusion, myocardial reoxygenation occurs, and it would be expected that the NO-heme complexes formed during ischemia would be oxidized and degraded. To determine the time course of this process and the levels of NO-heme complexes in the reperfused heart, experiments were performed in which hearts preinfused with 50 μm nitrite were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia followed by periods of reperfusion from 1 to 45 min. An initial rapid decrease was seen in the observed NO-heme EPR spectra over the first 15 min of reperfusion followed by a slow decrease thereafter with 26% of the signal intensity persisting at 45 min of reperfusion (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 8, the NO-heme signal decays from a value of 6.8 μm after 1 min to a value of 2 μm at 15 min and over the following 30 min only exhibits a small decrease to 1.75 μm. Thus the NO-heme signal exhibits biphasic decay with a rapid decrease in the early minutes of reperfusion and very slow decay thereafter.Fig. 8Graph of the levels of NO-heme complexes during reperfusion. Quantification was determined from the intensity of the observed EPR spectra in Fig. 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an effort to understand the overall effects of ischemia and reperfusion on the magnitude of NO-heme formation in the heart, a series of hearts (three at each time point) preloaded with 50 μm nitrite were subjected to periods of control perfusion, ischemia of 10–30 min duration, or 30 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion for periods of 1–45 min (Fig. 9). As clearly seen in this graph, the NO-heme levels rapidly rose from near 0, <0.1 μm, before ischemia to high μm levels after greater than 10–30 min of ischemia. Then, upon reperfusion, these levels rapidly declined by about 70% over the first 15 min but only slowly declined thereafter and remained markedly elevated out to 45 min. The decrease in NO-heme signal seen upon reperfusion could be due to oxidation or facilitated release/exchange of the NO bound at the heme site of Mb. With oxidation, nitrate formation would be observed, whereas for released NO, nitrite formation would be expected. Therefore, chemiluminescence NO analyzer studies were performed to measure the formation of the oxidized NO products nitrite and nitrate released from the heart in untreated or nitrite-preloaded hearts (50 μm nitrite infused 5 min before the onset of ischemia). To allow wash-out of residual nitrite in the vasculature, effluent collection was only sampled after the initial 1 min of reperfusion. In the hearts pre"

We found that HOS itself is an unstable protein that undergoes ubiquitination and degradation in a 26 S proteasome-dependent manner. A HOS mutant lacking the F-box that is deficient in binding to the core SCF components underwent ubiquitination less efficiently and was more stable than the wild type protein. Furthermore, ubiquitination and degradation of HOS was impaired in ts41 cells, in which the activities of Cullin-based ligases were decreased because the NEDD8 pathway was abrogated. Whereas HOS was directly ubiquitinated within the SCFHOS complex in vitro, the addition of phosphorylated IκBα inhibited this ubiquitination. Increasing cellular levels of HOS substrate (phosphorylated IκBα) by activating IκB kinase inhibited HOS ubiquitination and led to stabilization of HOS, indicating that interaction between HOS and its substrate might protect HOS from proteolysis. Taken together, our data suggest that proteolysis of HOS depends on its interaction with active components of the SCF complex and that HOS stability is regulated by a bound substrate. These findings may define a mechanism for maintaining activities of specific SCF complexes based on availability of a particular substrate.

Both recognition of a substrate and catalysis of ubiquitin transfer are the major functions of ubiquitin ligases that can be conferred by different domains of a single protein (e.g. Mdm2 and Nedd4) or different proteins within a complex enzyme (e.g. SCF, CBCVHL, APC (anaphase-promoting complex), etc.; for review, see Ref. 1Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). The modular features of complex ubiquitin ligases offer the biological advantages of expanded substrate specificity and rapid switching between various substrates to satisfy cell demand for ligase activity toward a particular substrate. However, an important mechanism regulating disassembly of existing complexes and assembly of new ones must be in place to allow rapid switching. Ubiquitination and degradation of ligase receptors that actually recognize specific substrates may enable the core ligase components to recruit different types of receptors to mediate such a mechanism. F-box proteins serve as receptors for the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) E3 ligases family, whose members ubiquitinate specifically phosphorylated substrates and play a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle, signal transduction and transcriptional activation (for review, see Ref. 2Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). F-box proteins contain WD40- or leucine-rich repeat domains that interact with phosphorylated substrates as well as an F-box motif, which is required for binding to Skp1 (3Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Skp1 tethers F-box proteins to the core ligase complex consisting of Cdc53/Cullin1 and Roc1/Rbx1, which, in turn, recruits an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and mediates substrate ubiquitination (for review, see Ref. 2Deshaies R.J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5362-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination and degradation of F-box proteins as a mechanism underlying reassembly of SCF complexes that allows rapid switching of F-box protein-determined substrate specificity was shown to be essential for cell growth (4Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), although other mechanisms regulating SCF assembly are likely to exist (9Cope G.A. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 663-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In yeast, genetic evidence indicates that ubiquitination and degradation of F-box proteins requires all the core SCF components. Given that the integrity of the F-box motif is also essential for degradation of F-box proteins, it has been suggested that their ubiquitination occurs within the SCF complex in an autocatalytic manner (4Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Galan J.M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been confirmed by biochemical analysis of Cdc4p ubiquitination (10Kamura T. Brower C.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30388-30393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that mammalian F-box protein Skp2 undergoes ubiquitination in vitro within the SCF complex (8Wirbelauer C. Sutterluty H. Blondel M. Gstaiger M. Peter M. Reymond F. Krek W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5362-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, other E3 ligases (such as APC (anaphase-promoting complex) or other SCFs) have been shown to be involved in regulating degradation of the F-box proteins, including Tome1 and Emi1 (11Ayad N.G.

Recent structural studies demonstrate that F-box proteins are positioned far apart from the core ligase components within the SCF E3 complexes, which exhibit a fairly rigid conformation with an ∼59 Å distance between the substrate/F-box interacting determinants and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme recruited by the core ligase components (14Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 15Zheng N.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Such a distance between an F-box protein and E2 does not explain direct ubiquitination of an F-box protein within the SCF complex unless additional factors enabling ubiquitination are involved. Indeed, it has been recently proposed that a release of activated E2 from the core ligase domains toward the lysine residues within the substrates must occur (18Deffenbaugh A.E. Scaglione K.M. Zhang L. Moore J.M. Buranda T. Sklar L.A. Skowyra D. Cell. 2003; 114: 611-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Whether in the absence of a substrate an F-box protein ubiquitination requires such release remains to be determined. Two opposite models could be envisioned to address a major question regarding a potential role for substrate availability in regulating the F-box protein stability. One of these models favors co-ubiquitination of an F-box protein together with a bound substrate, predicting that, in the absence of substrate, stabilization of an F-box protein may occur. Another model proposes that a substrate would shield an F-box protein from ubiquitination by core components of the SCF ligase (2Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence supporting either of these models has not been reported. In this study we sought to investigate the role of SCF ligase and the availability of a substrate in regulating the stability of the HOS F-box protein. HOS (also termed β-TrCP2/Fbw1b) serves as a receptor of the mammalian SCFHOS E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated IκB and β-catenin and regulate NF-κB and β-catenin-signaling pathways (19Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mechanisms determining the abundance of HOS play an important role in regulating these signaling cascades and in turn in modulating cell differentiation and malignant transformation (20Spiegelman V.S. Tang W. Chan A.M. Igarashi M. Aaronson S.A. Sassoon D.A. Katoh M. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1501-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We show that the integrity of the F-box of HOS and the activity of Cullin-based ligases are essential for ubiquitination and degradation of HOS. HOS is ubiquitinated within the SCFHOS complex in vitro, and the addition of phosphorylated IκB inhibits this process. Moreover, stimuli that increase the levels of phosphorylated IκB in cells stabilize HOS and increase its levels. These data provide an insight into the potential contribution of mechanisms regulating HOS stability in satisfying the cellular demands for continuous activity of the SCF-hos E3 ubiquitin ligase. DNA Constructs—The pCDNA3-based construct for expression of HA-tagged HOS was previously described (19Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HOS cDNA was subcloned into pEF-HA vector (a gift from E. Spanopoulou), and PCR-mediated mutagenesis was used to delete the cDNA sequence encoding HOS F-box (amino acids 117–169). Vectors for mammalian expression of FLAG-tagged IκBα proteins (22Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), Cullin1, Skp1, and Roc1 (23Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), as well as constitutively active IκB kinase β (IKKβS177E,S181E) (24Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and His- or HA-tagged ubiquitin (25Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) were described elsewhere. Plasmid for bacterial co-expression of Cullin 1 was prepared by PCR amplification from the pCDNA-FLAG-Cul1 template (with primers 5′-CATATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGATGTCG-3′ and 5′-CATATGTTAAGCCAAGTAACTGTAGGTGTCCTT-3′). The resulting PCR product was digested with NdeI and cloned into the pGEX4T3/pET15b-(GST-HA-Roc1) vector (26Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) via the pET15b-derived multiple cloning site, creating pGEX4T3/pET15b-(GST-HA-Roc1)-(FLAG-Cul1). To construct pET3a-Skp1, human Skp1 was amplified by PCR using pcDNA-hSkp1 vector as a template (with primers 5′-CGCCATATGCCTTCAATTAAGTTGCAGAG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCACTTCTCTTCACACCACTG-3′). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the pET3a vector. Tissue Culture and Transfections—Human 293T human embryo kidney cells and normal human fibroblasts (TIG, a gift from H. Tahara) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Hamster CHO-K1 and ts41 cells (a gift from R. Neve) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, antibiotics, and Fungizone (0.625 μg/ml, Invitrogen) at 34 °C and 5% CO2. These cells were shifted to 40 °C 24 h before harvesting where indicated. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate procedure or LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) at 24–48 h before harvesting. For cell treatment, actinomycin D, sodium salicylate, and cycloheximide (Sigma) as well as neocarzinostatin (NCS, Kayaku Co. Tokyo, Japan) were purchased and used at the indicated concentrations. Antibodies and Immunological Techniques—Antibodies against HA (Roche Applied Science), α-tubulin and FLAG M2 (Sigma), and IκBα (phosphoserine 32-specific, Santa Cruz) were purchased. Antibody against HOS (HOS-C) was previously described (27Spiegelman V.S. Tang W. Katoh M. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) were purchased. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses were described elsewhere (19Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Degradation of HOS proteins was assessed by pulse-chase or CHX chase analyses. For pulse-chase analysis, 293T cells grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected with HOS-HA plasmid were starved in medium lacking methionines and cysteine (Invitrogen), metabolically labeled with a [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and chased with complete medium supplemented with unlabeled methionine and cysteine (2 mm). Cells from a ⅓ sector of each plate were harvested at each time point of the chase, lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% of SDS, 1% of Triton X-100, and 0.5% of sodium deoxycholate and supplemented with inhibitors of proteases and phosphatases) and HOS proteins were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody, separated on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. For CHX chase analysis, unlabeled cells from a ¼ sector of each transfected plate were harvested at each time point after adding CHX (60 μg/ml) to the medium, lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with HA antibody. Ubiquitination Assays—In vivo ubiquitination assays of recombinant HOS were carried out as described elsewhere (25Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). For detection of ubiquitination of endogenous HOS proteins, cells were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin vector and treated with MG132 (40 μm for 1 h). Cells were harvested in a boiling solution of SDS (1% in Tris-buffered saline) and further disrupted by sonication. Lysates were diluted 10-fold with Triton X-100 solution (1% in Tris-buffered saline), incubated with protein A beads for 1 h, and centrifuged. Supernatants were analyzed using immunoprecipitation with HOS antibody and immunoblotting with HA and HOS antibodies. For an in vitro assay Skp1·FLAG-Cul1·GST-HA-Roc1 complex (SCR) was co-expressed in bacterial cells. To this end BL21pJY2 cells were transformed with both pGEX4T3/pET15b-(GST-HA-Roc1)-(FLAG-Cul1) and pET3a-Skp1. Freshly grown bacteria were induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the expressed proteins were co-purified by glutathione affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (26Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Bacterial lysates (200 μl) yielded ∼10 pmol of the SCR complex (as shown in Fig. 4A) by Coomassie staining. The SCR complex, derived from 50 μl of bacterial extracts and immobilized to glutathione beads, was assayed for ubiquitin ligase activity as previously described (28Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Briefly, this complex was incubated with 32P-labeled ubiquitin (1 μg), E1 (20 pmol), E2 (Cdc34 or UbcH5c, 100 pmol), and ATP (2 mm) in the presence of ubiquitination buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid) in a 20-μl total volume at 37 °C for 60 min. Formation of ubiquitin chains was analyzed by autoradiography. To prepare mammalian SCR plasmids for expression of FLAG-tagged Cullin1, Roc1, and Skp1 were transfected into 293T cells, and the entire complex was purified with immobilized FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma). For assessment of in vitro HOS ubiquitination, in vitro translated and [35S]methionine-labeled HOS was captured on immobilized SCR, washed with A-500 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol), re-equilibrated with ubiquitination buffer, and subjected to the ubiquitination reaction with recombinant E1 and E2 as indicated above. Phosphorylated by IKKβ (as described earlier (28Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar)) or non-phosphorylated GST-IκBα, proteins (25 pmol) were added before the start of the reaction as indicated. Products of the reactions were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. HOS Is Ubiquitinated in Cells and Undergoes Proteasome-dependent Degradation—We sought to investigate whether HOS undergoes ubiquitination and degradation in cells. 293T cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged HOS and hexahistidine-tagged ubiquitin and harvested. Immunoblotting analysis of ubiquitinated proteins purified on nickel resins under denaturing conditions (25Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) revealed slower migrating HA-reactive species as a smear at the top of the gel. These species were not observed when either HA-HOS of his-ubiquitin plasmids were omitted from transfection (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that HOS is covalently conjugated with ubiquitin in vivo under these experimental conditions. Previous findings demonstrate that treatment of cells with inhibitors of 26 S proteasome results in accumulation of recombinant HOS (19Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Xiong Y. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We assessed the effect of proteasome inhibition on the rate of HOS proteolysis by pulse-chase analysis. Recombinant HOS was used in these experiments because the low levels of HOS in cells precluded analyzing degradation of the endogenous protein. HOS rapidly degraded in 293T cells, and treating cells with proteasome inhibitors including MG132 (Fig. 1B) or lactacystin (data not shown) delayed this degradation. We next sought to investigate the effects of proteasome inhibitors on the levels of endogenous HOS. We immunoprecipitated endogenous HOS under stringent conditions from cells transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and treated or not with MG132. Analysis of HOS immunoprecipitates revealed that treatment with MG132 led to accumulation of HOS levels (Fig. 1C, lower panel) as well as of levels of slowly migrating HA-reactive species, indicative of ubiquitinated endogenous HOS (Fig. 1C, upper panel). In all, these data suggest that HOS is an unstable protein that undergoes ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent proteolysis. Integrity of the F-box Motif Is Required for Efficient Ubiquitination and Proteolysis of HOS—Ubiquitination and degradation of yeast F-box proteins depend on the integrity of their F-box motifs (4Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Galan J.M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We found that deletion of the F-box in HOS noticeably decreases, but does not entirely abolish this ubiquitination (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that more than one mode of regulation of HOS ubiquitination (F-box-dependent and F-box-independent) may be operative. Cycloheximide chase analysis showed that degradation of wild type HOS protein (Fig. 2B) occurs at a rate comparable with that observed in 35S-labeling pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 1B). Under these conditions degradation of HOSΔF mutant was substantially slower than that of HOSwt (Fig. 2B). These findings show that the efficiency of HOS ubiquitination and degradation depends on the integrity of the HOS F-box motif and suggest that, as in the case of yeast F-box proteins, the association of HOS with Skp1 within the SCF complex may play a role in regulating HOS stability. HOS Degradation Depends on the Activity of the NEDD8 Pathway—The ability of SCF E3 ligases to ubiquitinate their substrates is enhanced by covalent modification of Cullin proteins with ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 (26Wu K.

Palombella V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2326-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Conjugation of NEDD8 to Cullin proteins requires adequate activity of NEDD8-activating E1 enzyme. In temperature-sensitive hamster ts41 fibroblast cells, the APP-BP1 subunit of this enzyme is inactivated when cells are incubated at a non-permissive temperatures (40 °C) (32Chen Y. McPhie D.L. Hirschberg J. Neve R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8929-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), enabling use of these cells as a convenient model for studies of Cullin-dependent protein degradation (33Ohh M. Kim W.Y. Moslehi J.J. Chen Y. Chau V. Read M.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). When expressed in ts41 grown at permissive temperature (34 °C), HOS underwent rapid degradation as measured by CHX chase (Fig. 3A). However, incubation of ts41 cells at 40 °C noticeably delayed proteolysis of HOS. To exclude the possibility that inhibition of HOS degradation is a general characteristic of hamster cells exposed to 40 °C, we carried out a similar experiment in Chinese hamster ovarian cells, which harbor wild type APP-BP1 (33Ohh M. Kim W.Y. Moslehi J.J. Chen Y. Chau V. Read M.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this cell line, HOS degraded at 34 °C (although less efficiently than in ts41 cells, most likely because of the genetic differences between epithelial Chinese hamster ovarian cells and ts41 fibroblasts). However, HOS degradation was accelerated in Chinese hamster ovarian cells grown at 40 °C (Fig. 3A). We further focused our analysis at the levels of endogenous HOS in ts41 cells. Experiments with immunoprecipitation of HOS from ts41 cells transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin revealed that incubation of cells at 40 °C results in accumulation of endogenous HOS as well as in decrease in the extent of HOS ubiquitination (Fig. 3B). Altogether, these findings suggest that activity of NEDD8 pathway is important for HOS ubiquitination and proteolysis and, thus, are consistent with a role of SCF activities in regulating the rate of HOS degradation. Ubiquitination of HOS within the SCF Complex in Vitro Is Impaired in the Presence of a Substrate—Previous studies of yeast F-box proteins and Skp2 (4Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Galan J.M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These findings suggest that F-box proteins may undergo ubiquitination within the SCF complex in an autocatalytic manner. In addition, Cdc4p and Skp2 were efficiently ubiquitinated within the respective SCF complexes in vitro (8Wirbelauer C. Sutterluty H. Blondel M. Gstaiger M. Peter M. Reymond F. Krek W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5362-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 10Kamura T. Brower C.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30388-30393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We sought to analyze HOS ubiquitination in vitro. Our previous data showed that in vitro translated HOS efficiently binds to bacterially expressed GST-Skp1 protein (34Herter J.R. Fuchs S.Y. Med. Sci. Monit. 2002; 8: 283-288Google Scholar). We expressed and purified the core SCF complex (SCR) consisting of recombinant Skp1, FLAG-tagged Cullin1, and GST-tagged Roc1 and confirmed its ability to bind HOS but not HOSΔF mutant and to conjugate ubiquitin in the presence of E1 and E2 (Cdc34) in an in vitro ubiquitin ligase reaction (Fig. 4A). Intriguingly, in vitro-translated HOS captured on the (SCR) complex immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose did not undergo ubiquitination in the presence of either Cdc34 (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–3) or UbcH5c (Fig. 4B, lanes 4–6). Ubiquitination of an in vitro translated HOS was also undetectable, either when SCR was immobilized on M2-agarose or when immunoprecipitated HOS (stringently washed to remove proteins from rabbit reticulocyte lysate) was incubated with SCR in solution (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that in vitro translated HOS lacks modifications that may be required for its autocatalytic ubiquitination, we tested ubiquitination of HOS expressed in cells. Nevertheless, bacterially expressed SCR did not efficiently ubiquitinate HA-HOS immunopurified from 293T cells (data not shown). Because the complex lacks NEDD8 conjugation (Fig. 4A), which is required for its maximal activities (26Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) as well as for degradation of HOS in vivo (Fig. 3), we purified SCR from 293T cells in which Cullin1 undergoes appropriate NEDD8 modification (Refs. 26Wu K.

https://openalex.org/W2079737724,"Radiogenic isotope variations in mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) are commonly attributed to compositional variations in Earth's upper mantle. For the rheniumosmium isotope system, constituent MORB phases are shown to possess exceptionally high Re/Os (parent/daughter) ratios, consequently radiogenic 187Os is produced from the decay of 187Re over short periods of time. Thus, in the absence of precise age constraints, Os isotope variations cannot be unambiguously attributed to their source, although Re-Os isotope data for constituent minerals can yield crystallization ages, details of equilibration, and initial Os isotope values that relate directly to the mantle source."
https://openalex.org/W2079084987,"RasGAP (Ras GTPase-activating protein) is a negative regulator as well as a downstream effector of Ras. To identify partners of RasGAP we used it as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. This resulted in discovering its interaction with Akt. Overexpression of RasGAP or a mutant lacking the GTPase-activating domain (nGAP) enhanced phosphorylation and activity of Akt, which was dependent on the upstream integrin-linked kinase. Also, nGAP protected the cells against staurosporin-induced apoptosis through an Akt-dependent pathway. To determine the role of RasGAP in receptor-mediated activation of Akt, we used short hairpin RNA interference to knock out endogenous RasGAP expression. Although this procedure resulted in enhanced Ras activity, it inhibited Akt phosphorylation. Thus, we propose that Ras-GAP interacts with Akt and is necessary for its activation, possibly via integrin-linked kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-473. The data suggest that this effect is independent of Ras activity. RasGAP (Ras GTPase-activating protein) is a negative regulator as well as a downstream effector of Ras.

To determine the role of RasGAP in receptor-mediated activation of Akt, we used short hairpin RNA interference to knock out endogenous RasGAP expression. Although this procedure resulted in enhanced Ras activity, it inhibited Akt phosphorylation. Thus, we propose that Ras-GAP interacts with Akt and is necessary for its activation, possibly via integrin-linked kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-473. The data suggest that this effect is independent of Ras activity.

(Ras GTPase-activating protein) (amino acids 701-1044) interacts with the effector domain of Ras-GTP (1Adari H. Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Der C.J. McCormick F. Science. 1988; 240: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), resulting in activation of its intrinsic GTPase activity and subsequent termination of its downstream signaling. On the other hand, the N-terminal two-thirds of RasGAP (nGAP) consists of multiple domains, including hydrophobic src homology 3 (SH3)-binding, phosphotyrosine-binding src homology 2 (SH2), proline-binding src homology 3 (SH3), conserved region 2, and phospholipid-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. In the presence of apoptotic insults, the C-terminal catalytic domain is cleaved off. The remainder of the molecule (nGAP) confers protection to the cells from apoptosis (2Yang J.Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that RasGAP has a dominant effector function in cardiac versus epithelial cells (3Abdellatif M. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 525-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and that it induced hypertrophy of cardiac myocyte, via an as-yet unknown pathway (4Abdellatif M. Packer S.E. Michael L.H. Zhang D. Charng M.J. Schneider M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6729-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Evidence suggesting that RasGAP plays a role in the anti-apoptotic pathway comes from the RasGAP knock-out mouse model. The mice were smaller than the wild type littermates (5Henkemeyer M. Rossi D.J. Holmyard D.P. Puri M.C. Mbamalu G. Harpal K. Shih T.S. Jacks T. Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 377: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and died at E9.5 from what appeared to be extensive vascular system defects accompanied by widespread apoptosis in the brachial arch, hindbrain, optic stalk, and telencephalon. More direct evidence is seen when an injected antibody against the SH3 domain of RasGAP induces apoptosis in several cancerous cell lines (6Leblanc V. Tocque B. Delumeau I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5567-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RasGAP has been suggested to function as a sensor for caspase activity that determines the fate of the cell (2Yang J.Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When caspase-9 is moderately activated, RasGAP is cleaved into two fragments; the N-terminal fragment displays anti-apoptotic effects. Upon severe apoptotic stimuli, the N-terminal fragment of RasGAP is further cleaved, and the products potentiate apoptosis. Akt, which is a serine and threonine kinase, is recognized for its role in protection of the cell from programmed death (reviewed in Ref. 7Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar). It also induces protein synthesis and cellular hypertrophy that has been reported not only in cardiac (8Matsui T. Li L. Wu J.C. Cook S.A. Nagoshi T. Picard M.H. Liao R. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 9: 9Google Scholar, 9Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Obata T. Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. Mol.

Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar) but also in pancreatic β cells (11Bernal-Mizrachi E. Wen W. Stahlhut S. Welling C.M. Permutt M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1631-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These two functions are not mutually exclusive because they may have a common mediator, eIF4E (12Polunovsky V.A. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Peterson M. Tan A. Rubins J.B. Manivel J.C. Bitterman P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24776-24780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Akt is activated via a 3-step process (13Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). First, the kinase is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser-124 and Thr-450 in a PH-dependent, growth factor-independent fashion. Second, the kinase is recruited to the membrane via binding of its PH domain to phospholipids in a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-dependent mechanism. Third, the kinase is phosphorylated on Thr-308 and Ser-473 in a growth factor-dependent manner. The kinase phosphorylating the latter two sites has been identified as phospholipid-dependent kinase-1 alone or in collaboration with PRK2 (14Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), respectively. In addition, it has been reported that ILK also phosphorylates Ser-473. It is thought that the binding of the PH domain of Akt to phospholipid is not only important for membrane translocation but also induces a conformational change in Akt that enhances its phosphorylation. Our results provide evidence that RasGAP interacts with the PH domain of Akt and is required for its activation. This effect seems to be mediated through an ILK-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-473 and is independent of Ras activity. cDNA Library Construction and Screening Using the Yeast Two-hybrid System—Messenger RNA from 1-2-day-old neonatal rat hearts was extracted using the Oligotex mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen). The mRNA was reverse-transcribed and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGAD10 vector, upstream of the activation domain of GAL4. Methods and ingredients used were as provided with the yeast two-hybrid library construction kit from BD Biosciences. The library consisted of ∼2 × 106 independent clones with cDNA inserts that ranged in size from 0.5-4 kb. nGAP (amino acids 1-666 of RasGAP) was subcloned downstream of, and in-frame with, GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pAS2.1 vector. This construct was transfected into the yeast strain Y190 (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, cyhr2, LYS2::GAL1UAS-HISTATA-HIS3, URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-LacZ), using the BD Biosciences plasmid transfection kit. This was followed by transfection of the library cDNA and plating of the transformants on tryptophane-, leucine-, and histidine-deficient plates plus 3-aminotriazol (-Trp, -Leu, -His+3AT), for selection of positive interactions between the “bait” and its targets. Histidine-positive clones were also tested for lacZ expression, using a colorimetric filter assay as described in the BD Biosciences manual. The library cDNA plasmid was isolated and then reintroduced into the yeast with the bait or control constructs to reconfirm the interaction before sequencing the insert. Culturing Cardiac Myocyte and Adenovirus Infection—Cardiac myocytes were prepared as previously described (15Abdellatif M. Mcllelan W.R. Schneider M.D. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1994; 269: 15423-15426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were isolated from 1-2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. After dissociation the cells were subjected to Percoll gradient centrifugation followed by differential preplating to enrich for cardiac myocytes and deplete non-myocytes. Cells were then plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham F12 with 10% fetal calf serum at a density of 0.5-1 × 105 cells/cm2. 24 h after plating, serum was removed and the cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5-20 particles/cell. These cells were analyzed for viral effects 20-24 h after infection unless otherwise indicated. For cells infected with shRNA-expressing virus, the cells were harvested after 48 h to allow enough time for depletion of endogenous RasGAP. Construction of Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed, propagated, and titered as previously described by Graham and Prevec (16Graham F.L. Prevec L. Murray E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology. 7. The Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991Google Scholar). Briefly, pBHGloxΔE1,3Cre (Microbix), including the ΔE1 adenoviral genome, was co-transfected with the pDC shuttle vector containing the gene of interest into 293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Through homologous recombination, the test genes were integrated into the E1-deleted adenoviral genome. The viruses were propagated on 293 cells and purified using CsCl2 banding followed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-buffered saline with 2% glycerol. Titering was performed on 293 cells overlaid with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% equine serum and 0.5% agarose. The following cDNAs were constructed and introduced into adenoviruses. Full-length RasGAP cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. C. Der. Deletion mutants of that cDNA, including nGAP (amino acids 1-666) and ΔnGAP, which has a deletion of amino acids 1-157, were generated by PCR. The cDNA of wild type (wt) Akt and its dominant negative mutant were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc. The T308A and S473A mutations and the ΔPH deletion were then introduced by a two-step PCR in the wt background. Wild type ILK and ILK211A cDNA were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc. Assay of Akt Activity—For the Akt assay the cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% NP-50, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm Na pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors mixture. The assay was performed using a kit from Cell Signaling Technologies according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 100 μg of protein was incubated rocking with agarose-linked anti-Akt or anti-His antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice and resuspended with 40 μl of kinase assay buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, and 1 μg of glycogen synthase kinase-3 fusion protein for 30 min at 30 °C. The assay was stopped using sample buffer and boiled before analyzing by Western blotting using anti-phospho GSK-3 antibody. TUNEL Assay—The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/0.3% Tween in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C for 5 min followed by 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C for 20 min. The TUNEL reaction was performed using a kit from BD Biosciences according to the recommended protocol. Briefly, cells were incubated in 200 mm cacodylate (pH 6.6), 25 mm Tris (pH 6.6), 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 mm cobalt chloride equilibration buffer with fluorescein-dUTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by 2× SSC, and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst before imaging. Determining Mitochondrial Membrane Integrity—Myocytes were plated on glass chamber slides. Cells were then infected with the indicated viruses for 24 h in serum-free medium. Five μg of Mitosensor (BD Biosciences) was added to live cells and incubated for 15 min before imaging. The Mitosensor reflects uptake by the mitochondria when it forms red aggregates or remains in the cytoplasm and emits green florescence upon mitochondrial damage. Construction of Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Adenoviral Expression Vectors—pSilencer 1.0-U6 expression vector was purchased from Ambion. The U6 RNA polymerase III promoter and the polycloning region were subcloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector pDC311 (Microbix). The hairpin-forming oligo, corresponding to bases 2315-2336 (5′-AAGATGAAGCCACTACCCTATTTCAAGAGAATAGGGTAGTGGCTTCATCTTTTTTTT) of the rat RasGAP cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_013135), and its antisense with ApaI and Hind III overhangs were synthesized, annealed, and subcloned distal to the U6 promoter. The loop sequence is underlined. A recombinant adenovirus was generated using homologous recombination in 293 as described above. A mutant oligo including six mismatch mutations (in bold) was also generated for use as a control (5′-AAGACAAAGTTACTAAACTATTTCAAGAGAATAGTTTAGTAACTTTGTCTTTTTTTT). Cell Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—For cell fractionation, myocytes were homogenized in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 mm MgCl2, plus protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science), using Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was spun at 500 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and intact cells. The resultant supernatant was transferred to a polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube and spun at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from this step, representing the cytosolic fraction, was separated, and the remaining pellet including surface and endoplasmic membranes was resuspended in RIPA buffer. For immunoprecipitation studies, a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was used to lyse the cells or dilute recombinant proteins. The samples consisting of either 200 μg of total cellular protein or 0.1 μg of recombinant protein were then incubated with the indicated antibody in the presence of protein A/G-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C, rocking. The beads were then washed three times with the above buffer and the proteins released using 50 μl of 2× sample buffer at 95 °C. 20 μl of the final sample was analyzed on a 4-15% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by blotting on a nitrocellulose membrane. The primary and secondary antibody incubation buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 138 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% bovine serum albumin. The antibodies used include anti-RasGAP and anti-ILK (Upstate Biotechnologies); anti-C-terminal RasGAP (Alexis Biochemicals); anti-His (Sigma); anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt (Thr-308), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and PathScan Multiplex Western Mixture I (Cell Signaling); anti-GST and anti-β-spectrin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-β-galactosidase (Roche Applied Science). The PathScan Multiplex Western Mixture I includes antibodies for phospho-p90RSK (Ser-308), phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser-235/236), and eIF4E. Assay of Ras Activity—Ras activity was assayed by measuring its GTP-bound fraction. This was accomplished using agarose-bound Raf-1 Ras-binding domain (Upstate Biotechnologies) as described by the manufacturer. RasGAP Interacts with the PH Domain of Akt—To identify proteins that physically associate with RasGAP in the heart, we used its nGAP fused to Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4 DB) as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat neonatal heart cDNA library. This fragment included the N-terminal SH2-SH3-SH2 and the pleckstrin homology domains. As a result we identified the PH domain of Akt as a target that interacted with nGAP, but not p85 phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, which also contains SH2-SH3 domains, or the GAL4 DB region (not shown). These results were confirmed in vitro by co-immunoprecipitation of a GST fusion protein of the SH3-SH2-SH3 domains of RasGAP (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2), but not GST alone (lanes 3 and 4), with unphosphorylated or phosphorylated Akt-His using agarose-linked anti-His, thus proving a direct interaction between the two molecules. Conversely, a GST fusion of the PH domain of Akt, but not GST alone, co-immunoprecipitated with nGAP-His (lanes 5 and 6), establishing the PH domain as the site of interaction. Eventually, we were able to confirm co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins using an antibody against the C-terminal catalytic domain of RasGAP (Fig. 1B). 200 μg of cell homogenate was used for immunoprecipitation, of which half was loaded on the gel represented in Fig. 1B, and 20 μg of total cell lysate was loaded for estimating immunoprecipitation efficiency. In this experiment, ∼35% of total RasGAP was immunoprecipitated and ∼38% of Akt was co-immunoprecipitated. Thus, the stoichiometry of the interaction calculated from the relative detectable levels of RasGAP:Akt is ∼1:1.3. It should be emphasized though that this estimate is inaccurate until it is normalized to the relative affinities of the corresponding antibodies, which are unknown, and thus may not faithfully represent the endogenous stoichiometry between the two proteins. We also show that RasGAP does not interact with β-spectrin, which similarly contains a PH domain, thus suggesting specificity to the PH domain of Akt. RasGAP Enhances Ser-473 Phosphorylation of Akt and Activity through an ILK-dependent Mechanism—Recently, Yang and Widmann (17Yang J.Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of the N-terminal domain of RasGAP enhanced Akt activity. We observed similar results when nGAP was expressed in cardiac myocytes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). This effect was lost upon deletion of the N-terminal region, including the N-terminal SH2 domain (1-260). But activation of Akt by nGAP was much weaker (2.5×) compared with activation by FBS (7×) (Fig. 3B) and was accompanied by phosphorylation of Ser-473 and, less significantly, Thr-308 (Fig. 3A). Thus, to determine the relative importance of these phospho-amino acids in activating the kinase, we generated alanine-substitution mutants of either. The results show that although the S473A mutant was phosphorylated on Thr-308, nGAP or FBS-induced activity was completely abolished (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, mutation of Thr-308 reduced FBS- (2.5×) but not nGAP-induced activity (2.5×). The results suggest that nGAP preferentially enhances Ser-473 phosphorylation, which alone can partially activate Akt. In contrast, phospho-Thr-308 does not have the capacity to independently activate Akt.Fig. 3nGAP enhances phosphorylation of Akt-Ser-473. A, cultured myocytes were uninfected (Control, C) or infected with 10 m.o.i. of adenoviruses delivering LacZ or nGAP cDNA, where indicated on the top of each lane, in serum-free medium for 24 h or treated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 20 min following 24 h of serum starvation. In addition, each of the above was co-infected with adenoviruses delivering either recombinant Akt-His (wt), Akt473A-His (S473A), or Akt308A-His (T308A) as indicated on the left of each row. Twenty μg of protein were then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Thr-308 Akt, or anti-phospho-Ser-473 Akt as indicated at the bottom of each column. B, 200 μg of the same cell extracts were also assayed for the recombinant virally delivered Akt activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Whereas phospholipid-dependent kinase-1 is involved in phosphorylation of Thr-308, ILK has been shown to phosphorylate Ser-473 (18Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether activation of Akt by RasGAP is mediated through ILK. For that purpose we co-expressed RasGAP with a dominant negative ILK (ILK211A) in the cardiac cells. This mutant has a substitution of Arg-211 to Ala in the PH domain and was shown to completely inhibit basal levels and serum-stimulated Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation (19Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The results of this experiment show that ILK211A completely inhibited RasGAP-induced Akt activation (Fig. 4A). In contrast, overexpression of wild type (wt) ILK increased Akt activity by ∼4× at 5 m.o.i. (Fig. 4B). However, co-delivery of nGAP and ILK did not result in any further enhancement of activity of the kinase. This might imply that they both employ the same mechanism or pathway to activate Akt and that it is limited by their combined concentration. Overall, the data suggest that RasGAP facilitates phosphorylation of Ser-473 through an ILK-dependent mechanism. RasGAP Protects Cells against Apoptosis via an Akt-dependent Mechanism—Because Akt is well established for its anti-apoptotic function, we questioned whether nGAP had the capacity to confer an Akt-dependent anti-apoptotic effect in cardiac myocytes. The results show that overexpression of nGAP, but not the control β-galactosidase virus, reduced staurosporin-induced apoptosis by 80 ± 12% after 2 h of its application as measured by DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5A). In Fig. 5A the cardiac myocytes are also labeled with anti-myosin heavy chain antibody (red) to establish the cell type. Next, to confirm these results, we tested the integrity of the mitochondria under the same conditions. By using a mitochondrial sensor “Mitosensor,” we found that the protective effect of nGAP also preserved mitochondrial integrity, as demonstrated by the predominance of red florescent aggregates in healthy mitochondria versus green florescence in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). To determine the extent of the protective effect of nGAP and its dependence on Akt, we performed a time course for staurosporin treatment in the absence or presence of nGAP with or without co-expression of a dominant negative Akt mutant (dnAkt). The results show that nGAP was almost completely protective within 1 h of staurosporine treatment but only partially effective after longer incubation periods (Fig. 5C). The presence of dnAKT completely inhibited its anti-apoptotic effect. DnAkt had no effect on cell viability by itself under those conditions. We observed, though, a slight increase in apoptosis when both nGAP and dnAkt were added to the cells. This could be explained by the accumulation of apoptotic cleavage products of nGAP, which are generated after prolonged or severe apoptotic insults as previously reported (2Yang J.Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The data suggest that the anti-apoptotic effects of RasGAP may be mediated via its activation of Akt and are limited to mild or transient apoptotic insults. RasGAP Is Required for Serum-induced Akt Activation—The data of Yang and Widmann (17Yang J.Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) suggest that during apoptosis RasGAP is cleaved and that the N-terminal region including the SH2-SH3 domains activates Akt. Our data are in agreement; in addition, we discovered a physical association between the two molecules. However, in both cases the activation of Akt is observed in experiments in which exogenous nGAP is delivered and overexpressed, thus obscuring its physiological relevance. Therefore, we questioned whether endogenous RasGAP plays a role in regulating Akt activity. To address this, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the expression of RasGAP in rat cardiac myocytes. For that purpose we designed a hairpin-forming sequence corresponding to bp 2315-2336 of the rat cDNA that was cloned downstream of the U6 polymerase III-dependent promoter and delivered to the cells via an adenovirus vector. This sequence has been previously used by Kunath et al. (20Kunath T. Gish G. Lickert H. Jones N. Pawson T. Rossant J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) to knock down RasGAP in a transgenic mouse model, which faithfully recapitulated the phenotype of the genomic knock-out. 48 h after delivery of this construct to cardiac myocytes, RasGAP protein, but not actin or filamin, was down-regulated in a specific and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Vice versa, an RNAi against filamin (irrelevant to this study) down-regulated filamin but not RasGAP (Fig. 6B). In addition, a mutant RasGAP shRNA failed to have any effect and was used as a control in subsequent experiments (see Fig. 8).Fig. 8Down-regulation of RasGAP inhibits serum-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Serum-starved cultured cardiac cells were infected with 2.5 m.o.i. of adenovirus delivering RasGAP-shRNAi or a mutant oligonucleotide (mtRasGAP-shRNA). After 48 h, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added for 5, 20, or 60 min before cell lysis as indicated. The cells were then homogenized and the cytosolic and membranous fractions separated. 20 μg of each was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-Ser-473 Akt, anti-phospho-ribosomal S6, anti-RasGAP, or anti-Akt as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the established function of RasGAP is to stimulate the endogenous GTPase activity of Ras, we measured the effect of its knockdown on serum-stimulated Ras-GTP formation. As seen in Fig. 7, reduction of RasGAP protein by RNAi resulted in accumulation of Ras-GTP compared with its typical disappearance within 60 min. Although the activity of Ras was thus prolonged by the absence of RasGAP, the Ser-473 phosphorylation of Akt was nearly completely abolished both in the cytosolic and membrane fractions (Fig. 8). This was paralleled by a reduction in the phosphorylation of the downstream effector of Akt, ribosomal S6 protein. As seen, these effects accompanied RNAi-induced knockdown of RasGAP but not Akt expression (lower panels). We also tested the effect of RasGAP depletion on other serum-stimulated signaling molecules, including p90RSK, Erk1/2, and eIF4E after 20 min or 24 h. This was achieved using a multiplex of antibodies for phospho-p90RSK (Ser-308), phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser-235/236), and eIF4E (PathScan Multiplex Western Mixture I; Cell Signaling), which allows detection of the activity of multiple signaling pathways on the same blot while avoiding variability that may result from stripping the membranes. As seen in Fig. 9, RasGAP is necessary for Akt and S6, but not for p90RSK or Erk1/2, phosphorylation. However, we did observe a slight reduction of Erk1/2 phosphorylation (30 ± 10%), which suggests that RasGAP may also play a partial indirect role in activating this kinase. We also noticed a consistent reduction in eIF4E protein in RasGAP-deficient cells. Whereas the expression of eIF4E is up-regulated by c-myc (21Rosenwald I.B. Rhoads D.B. Callanan L.D. Isselbacher K.J. Schmidt E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6175-6178Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), RasGAP-associated endoribonuclease protein G3BP cleaves c-myc mRNA (22Tourriere H. Gallouzi I. Chebli K. Capony J.P. Mouaikel J. van Der Geer P. Tazi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7747-7760Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This function of G3BP requires its nuclear translocation. Therefore, in the absence of RasGAP, free G3BP may result in enhanced c-Myc mRNA degradation and, in turn, decreased eIF4E. In summary, RasGAP is specifically required for receptor-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in cardiac myocytes. The results also show that although RasGAP binds to the PH domain of Akt it has no effect on its membrane localization. Accumulating evidence suggests that RasGAP severs more functions than just the acceleration of the GTPase activity of Ras. These functions are most likely mediated by the N-terminal two-thirds of the molecule, which is rich in protein-protein-interacting domains. Our previous data show that RasGAP is preferentially an effector rather than a negative regulator of Ras functions in cardiac myocytes (3Abdellatif M. Schneider M.D. J. Biol.

We also showed that the N-terminal region of RasGAP induces cardiac cell hypertrophy and RNA polymerase II phosphorylation (4Abdellatif M. Packer S.E. Michael L.H. Zhang D. Charng M.J. Schneider M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6729-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Likewise, Medema et al. (23Medema R. Laat W.L.D. Martin G.A. McCormick F. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have shown that the SH2-SH3 domains of RasGAP can induce the c-fos promoter. Furthermore, antibodies against the SH3 blocked germinal vesicle breakdown (24Duchesne M. Schweighoffer F. Parker F. Clerc F. Frobert Y. Thang M.N. Tocque B. Science. 1993; : 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), Cdc2 activation (25Pomerance M. Thang M.N. Tocque B. Pierre M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and cytoskeletal reorganization (6Leblanc V. Tocque B. Delumeau I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5567-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) induced by activated Ras. In addition, an anti-apoptotic function of RasGAP has been suggested, possibly through an Akt-dependent pathway (2Yang J.Y. Widmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5346-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Leblanc V. Delumeau I. Tocque B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the knock-out mouse also supports a more intricate role of RasGAP (5Henkemeyer M. Rossi D.J. Holmyard D.P. Puri M.C. Mbamalu G. Harpal K. Shih T.S. Jacks T. Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 377: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), but the downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Our results here show that RasGAP interacts with the PH domain of Akt. When RasGAP is overexpressed, it enhances phosphorylation and activity of Akt and protects the cells against apoptotic insults; when down-regulated it inhibits serum-induced stimulation of Akt. However, we have not demonstrated that the effect of RasGAP on Akt is a direct result of their interaction. Although we found that a PH domain deletion mutant of Akt that fails to interact with RasGAP also fails to respond to its activating effect, this construct differed from the wild type in its inability to localize to membranes (not shown), which might have been the primary reason for its irresponsiveness to nGAP. Thus, a more precise delineation of the interaction site that does not disrupt other functions is necessary to successfully address this issue. Nevertheless, it is difficult to perceive that interaction of RasGAP with Akt does not play a role in mediating its activating effect. Although the PH domain is mainly known to confer interaction with phosphoinositides, it also associates with protein targets such as Gβγ subunits (27Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or in the case of the PH domain of Akt, it has been shown to interact with protein kinase C isoforms (28Konishi H. Kuroda S. Tanaka M. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and Tcl1 (29Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 30Pekarsky Y. Koval A. Hallas C. Bichi R. Tresini M. Malstrom S. Russo G. Tsichlis P. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3028-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Similar to what we see with RasGAP, Tcl1 interacts with the PH domain of Akt and when overexpressed in 293T cells it enhances its activity and in vivo phosphorylation. We show that RasGAP mainly enhances phosphorylation of Ser-473, while Laine et al. (29Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) record Tcl1-induced phosphorylation of Thr-308 as well. In that study, phosphorylation of Akt is enhanced in vitro in the absence of any of its known phosphorylating kinases, suggesting that Tcl1 induces autophosphorylation of both sites. Although we show the effect of RasGAP is mediated by ILK, it remains to be tested whether it has the capacity to induce autophosphorylation as well. A plausible mechanism for the activating effect of RasGAP would be inducement of a conformational change through its binding to the PH domain, which facilitates phosphorylation of Ser-473 by ILK. Thus, although phosphoinositides might bind to the PH domain and mediate localization to the membrane, proteins such as Tcl1 and RasGAP, which bind the same domain, might be necessary for inducing the conformational change necessary for phosphorylation and activation of the kinase. Some aspects of our results agree with those of Yang et al. (17Yang J.Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) who also reported that nGAP activated Akt and exerted anti-apoptotic effects. In their study they show that nGAP protected the cells against the apoptotic effect of the C-terminal catalytic domain of RasGAP (which is cleaved off during apoptosis) and activated Akt and Ras, and its effect was inhibited by dominant negative Akt or Ras mutants, suggesting a Ras-dependent mechanism for activating Akt. Although we also show that nGAP activated Akt and that its anti-apoptotic effect was inhibited by dnAkt, we were unable to detect Ras activation (not shown). Also, we have discovered a physical association between RasGAP and Akt, which suggests a direct role of RasGAP in influencing Akt activity. Thus, the question that presented itself concerned the role of endogenous RasGAP in regulating Akt activity. If the effect of RasGAP is mediated through activation of Ras then its ablation, which is expected to increase active Ras-GTP formation, should subsequently enhance Akt activity. What our results show is that knock down of RasGAP expression by RNAi did indeed increase Ras-GTP formation but, on the other hand, abrogated serum-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Thus it appears that, at least in cardiac myocytes, RasGAP is required for activation of Akt through a Ras-independent mechanism. The level of increase in Akt activity that Yang et al. (17Yang J.Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) record is similar to what we report in this study (∼2-3-fold) and is accompanied by phosphorylation of Ser-473. In the latter study there were no data on the measurement of Thr-308 phosphorylation, and we were unable to detect a significant increase in cardiac cells either. Although phosphorylation of both Thr-308 and Ser-473 is required for full activation of Akt, it has been previously shown that independent phosphorylation of these sites can result in its partial activation. Alessi et al. (31Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a 473D or a 308D mutant of Akt had 5-fold higher constitutive activity relative to wild type. Similarly, our results show that phosphorylation of Ser-473 only, by RasGAP or serum, results in ∼2.5× activation of Akt. In our study, as well as that of Yang and Widmann (17Yang J.Y. Widmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14641-14646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), this extent of activation of Akt was sufficient to protect the cells from programmed death. However, we show here that this protection was limited to a 1-2-h delay in the onset of apoptosis. In conclusion, RasGAP physically associates with Akt and is necessary for its activation in a Ras-independent manner in cardiac myocytes though the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W2047090713,"Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) is a cell surface peptidase expressed by numerous tissues including prostatic epithelial cells. We reported that NEP inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and cell migration by enzymatic inactivation of neuropeptide substrates and through protein-protein interaction independent of catalytic function. The cytoplasmic domain of NEP contains a positively charged amino acid cluster, previously identified as a binding site for ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins. We report here that NEP co-immunoprecipitates with ERM proteins in NEP-expressing LNCaP prostate cancer cells and MeWo melanoma cells. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that ERM proteins associate with wild-type NEP protein but not NEP protein containing a truncated cytoplasmic domain or point mutations replacing the positively charged amino acid cluster. <i>In vitro</i> binding assays showed that NEP binds directly to recombinant N terminus fragments of ERM proteins at the positively charged amino acid cluster within the NEP cytoplasmic domain. Binding of ERM proteins to NEP results in decreased binding of ERM proteins to the hyaluronan receptor CD44, a main binding partner of ERM proteins. Moreover, cells expressing wild-type NEP demonstrate decreased adhesion to hyaluronic acid and cell migration. These data suggest that NEP can affect cell adhesion and migration through direct binding to ERM proteins."
