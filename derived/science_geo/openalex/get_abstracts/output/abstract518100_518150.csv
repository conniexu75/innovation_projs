https://openalex.org/W1973654985,"The strength of synaptic connections fundamentally determines how neurons influence each other's firing. Excitatory connection amplitudes between pairs of cortical neurons vary over two orders of magnitude, comprising only very few strong connections among many weaker ones. Although this highly skewed distribution of connection strengths is observed in diverse cortical areas, its functional significance remains unknown: it is not clear how connection strength relates to neuronal response properties, nor how strong and weak inputs contribute to information processing in local microcircuits. Here we reveal that the strength of connections between layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) obeys a simple rule--the few strong connections occur between neurons with most correlated responses, while only weak connections link neurons with uncorrelated responses. Moreover, we show that strong and reciprocal connections occur between cells with similar spatial receptive field structure. Although weak connections far outnumber strong connections, each neuron receives the majority of its local excitation from a small number of strong inputs provided by the few neurons with similar responses to visual features. By dominating recurrent excitation, these infrequent yet powerful inputs disproportionately contribute to feature preference and selectivity. Therefore, our results show that the apparently complex organization of excitatory connection strength reflects the similarity of neuronal responses, and suggest that rare, strong connections mediate stimulus-specific response amplification in cortical microcircuits."

https://openalex.org/W2167400551,"Electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) have experienced sharp increases in popularity over the past five years due to many factors, including aggressive marketing, increased restrictions on conventional cigarettes, and a perception that E-cigs are healthy alternatives to cigarettes. Despite this perception, studies on health effects in humans are extremely limited and in vivo animal models have not been generated. Presently, we determined that E-cig vapor contains 7x1011 free radicals per puff. To determine whether E-cig exposure impacts pulmonary responses in mice, we developed an inhalation chamber for E-cig exposure. Mice that were exposed to E-cig vapor contained serum cotinine concentrations that are comparable to human E-cig users. E-cig exposure for 2 weeks produced a significant increase in oxidative stress and moderate macrophage-mediated inflammation. Since, COPD patients are susceptible to bacterial and viral infections, we tested effects of E-cigs on immune response. Mice that were exposed to E-cig vapor showed significantly impaired pulmonary bacterial clearance, compared to air-exposed mice, following an intranasal infection with Streptococcus pneumonia. This defective bacterial clearance was partially due to reduced phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages from E-cig exposed mice. In response to Influenza A virus infection, E-cig exposed mice displayed increased lung viral titers and enhanced virus-induced illness and mortality. In summary, this study reports a murine model of E-cig exposure and demonstrates that E-cig exposure elicits impaired pulmonary anti-microbial defenses. Hence, E-cig exposure as an alternative to cigarette smoking must be rigorously tested in users for their effects on immune response and susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections."

These results highlight a readily assayed biomarker, threat-related amygdala reactivity, which predicts psychological vulnerability to commonly experienced stressors and represents a discrete target for intervention and prevention. Exposure to stressful life events is a robust risk factor for the development of treatment-resistant, chronic psychological problems including major depression and anxiety disorders (Faravelli, 1985Faravelli C.

Causal relationship between stressful life events and the onset of major depression.Am. J. Psychiatry. 1999; 156: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). However, whereas most individuals experience stressful life events at some point, the lifetime prevalence for major depression and anxiety disorders is 17% and 29%, respectively (Kessler et al., 2005Kessler R.C. Berglund P. Demler O. Jin R. Merikangas K.R. Walters E.E. Lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2005; 62: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (12944) Google Scholar), indicating that only a subset of individuals experiencing life events will ultimately develop psychopathology. The ability to prospectively identify which individuals are at greatest risk represents a critical gap in our ability to effectively intervene and prevent the emergence of disabling psychological problems. Focusing such efforts on biological processes involved in stress reactivity and regulation is particularly important as they represent not only predictive markers of risk but also discrete targets for intervention and prevention. Amygdala reactivity to threat is a prime candidate biomarker for psychological risk to common stressors given its critical roles in threat detection, stress reactivity, and memory for negative information (Herman and Cullinan, 1997Herman J.P.

Thus, relatively greater amygdala reactivity to common stressors could lead to an altered stress response and biased appraisal and memory of stressful events, all of which are core symptoms and features of depression and anxiety disorders (Burke et al., 2005Burke H.M.

Not surprisingly, heightened threat-related amygdala reactivity is consistently observed in patients with depression and anxiety (Etkin and Wager, 2007Etkin A. Wager T.D.

Rev. 2013; 37: 152-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, cross-sectional research in patients cannot determine whether heightened amygdala reactivity is a premorbid vulnerability present before the development of symptoms, or whether this neural phenotype is a secondary correlate that emerges as a downstream consequence of the onset of symptoms. Prospective research is required to address this limitation and test whether amygdala reactivity predicts internalizing symptoms at a future point in time, controlling for baseline symptom levels. Adolescents at heightened risk for the development of depression and anxiety through a positive family history for these disorders evidence heightened amygdala reactivity to threat (Joormann et al., 2012Joormann J.

It remains to be determined, however, whether such heightened amygdala reactivity predicts the development of internalizing symptoms following the experience of stress in the future. Indeed, only two studies with small samples have examined such a prospective association, with both finding that relatively increased amygdala reactivity measured before the experience of a major traumatic event (i.e., warzone combat [Admon et al., 2009Admon R. Lubin G. Stern O. Rosenberg K. Sela L. Ben-Ami H. Hendler T. Human vulnerability to stress depends on amygdala’s predisposition and hippocampal plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar] or a terrorist attack [McLaughlin et al., 2014McLaughlin K.A. Busso D.S. Duys A. Green J.G. Alves S. Way M. Sheridan M.A. Amygdala response to negative stimuli predicts PTSD symptom onset following a terrorist attack.Depress. Anxiety. 2014; 31: 834-842https://doi.org/10.1002/da.22284Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar]) predicted greater subsequent posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. While these findings suggest that threat-related amygdala reactivity may represent a predictive biomarker of psychological vulnerability to extreme and rare forms of trauma, we do not know whether threat-related amygdala reactivity has similar predictive utility in the broader population, who experience milder forms of common stressful life events. To examine whether relatively increased threat-related amygdala reactivity prospectively predicts psychological vulnerability to common life stressors, we used fMRI to assess baseline threat-related amygdala reactivity in 753 participants aged 18–22 years old, all of whom were free of current depression or anxiety disorders. We chose a sample of young adults as this developmental stage marks the beginning of a peak period of risk for the emergence of a number of internalizing disorders, including major depression, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (Kessler et al., 2005Kessler R.C. Berglund P. Demler O. Jin R. Merikangas K.R. Walters E.E. Lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2005; 62: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (12944) Google Scholar). A widely utilized and well-established face-matching paradigm was used to robustly elicit threat-related amygdala reactivity (Nikolova et al., 2014Nikolova Y.S. Koenen K.C. Galea S. Wang C.M. Seney M.L. Sibille E. Williamson D.E. Hariri A.R. Beyond genotype: serotonin transporter epigenetic modification predicts human brain function.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Prather et al., 2013Prather A.A. Bogdan R. Hariri A.R. Impact of sleep quality on amygdala reactivity, negative affect, and perceived stress.Psychosom. Med. 2013; 75: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). At the time of scanning, participants reported the number of stressful life events they had experienced in the prior year, as well as their experience of childhood trauma and their current levels of depression and anxiety symptoms. We used these baseline measures as covariates in all analyses to test whether amygdala reactivity prospectively predicts future psychological problems as a function of stress above and beyond participants’ reported symptoms and stress levels at baseline. After successful completion of the baseline protocol including fMRI, all participants were subsequently contacted by e-mail every 3 months and invited to complete a short online assessment of their current mood and experience of stressful life events since their last assessment. At baseline and each follow-up, participants were given a checklist (Clements and Turpin, 1996Clements K. Turpin G. The life events scale for students: Validation for use with British samples.Pers. Individ. Dif. 1996; 20: 747-751Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) of stressful life events commonly experienced by students (e.g., death of a very good friend, major car accident, parent losing a job) and were asked to indicate which events had occurred since the last assessment as well as the impact of that event. We calculated the sum of all impact scores for each event reported; thus, higher scores can reflect both a greater number of events as well as more severe events. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were reported at baseline and each follow-up assessment (Watson et al., 1995Watson D. Clark L.A. Weber K. Assenheimer J.S. Strauss M.E. McCormick R.A. Testing a tripartite model: II. Exploring the symptom structure of anxiety and depression in student, adult, and patient samples.J. Abnorm. Psychol. 1995; 104: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). fMRI results were first examined in SPM8 to ensure that the task elicited predicted activation in the amygdala (Figure 1A). As expected, the contrast of fearful and angry faces > shapes was associated with bilateral amygdala reactivity: left amygdala, t(810) = 28.7, p < 0.001 FWE-corrected, peak coordinates (x, y, z): (−22, −6, −18), and right amygdala, t(810) = 32.5, p < 0.001 corrected, (28, −4, 20). A mean parameter estimate reflecting amygdala reactivity as a function of our task (i.e., fearful and angry facial expressions versus shapes) was extracted for each participant and entered into regression models in MPlus v7. To test our hypothesis that baseline threat-related amygdala reactivity predicts psychological vulnerability to the subsequent experience of common life stressors at any point in the future, we first created a model (Model A; Figure 1B) using the largest sample of participants that completed an online assessment at any time post-scanning. For participants that completed multiple assessments, we selected data from the most recent assessment available. Follow-up assessments were available from a total of 340 participants and were collected approximately 1 year post-scanning (M = 468 days, Min-Max = 90–1,402). Model A was significant (Table S1; p < 0.001), with the interaction between amygdala reactivity and life stress reported post-scanning predicting the severity of symptoms (B = 2.01, SE = 0.7, t(339) = 3.08, p = 0.002). Specifically, individuals with relatively heightened amygdala reactivity at baseline who also reported experiencing greater life stress subsequent to scanning had significantly greater symptoms at follow-up (Figure 1C and Figure S1). Exploratory whole-brain results are reported in Table S2. While Model A confirmed our hypothesis that amygdala reactivity represents a predictive biomarker of psychological vulnerability to common life stressors, this model included participants who completed post-scanning assessments in relatively close proximity to the scan (e.g., 3 months). To determine the long-term predictive utility of threat-related amygdala reactivity, we next analyzed data from only those participants who completed an online assessment at least 1 year post-scanning (Model B; Figure 2A). For this model, 192 participants were included who completed their assessment on average 2 years post-baseline (M = 683 days, Min-Max = 365–1,402). Model B was significant (Table S3; p < 0.001), with the interaction between amygdala reactivity and life stress predicting symptom severity following stress occurring approximately 2 years later (B = 1.75, SE = 0.8, t(191) = 2.33, p = 0.02). Again, participants with relatively heightened amygdala reactivity at baseline who experienced relatively high life stress post-scanning reported the greatest symptoms (Figure 2B and Figure S2). A limitation of our previous models is that we used concurrent reports of life stress and internalizing symptoms from the most recent assessment available. Participants experiencing greater negative affect at the time of assessment may be biased toward indicating greater severity of recent life stress. Therefore, we created a final model (Model C, Figure 3A) in which life stress was assessed prospective to the reporting of symptoms. To equate participants in terms of when stressful life events and symptoms were measured, we obtained symptoms from assessments completed approximately 1 year post-scanning. We then computed the mean life stress score for all assessments completed prior to this, yielding a prospective set of variables including threat-related amygdala reactivity at baseline, life stress that occurred post-scanning, and symptoms approximately 1 year post-scanning. Data from 99 participants were available for this analysis. The moderation Model C was significant (Table S3; p < 0.001), indicating a significant interaction between threat-related amygdala reactivity and subsequent life stress in predicting internalizing symptoms 1 year later (B = 5.56, SE = 1.9, t(98) = 2.96, p = 0.003). As in our previous models, individuals with relatively heightened amygdala reactivity who experienced greater life stress post-scanning reported greater internalizing symptoms 1 year later (Figure 3B and Figure S3). The interaction between amygdala reactivity and life stress explained an additional 5% of the variance in symptoms, above and beyond all covariates, including symptoms reported at baseline. Using data from a large longitudinal study of healthy young adults, we provide novel evidence for the utility of threat-related amygdala reactivity—assessed with fMRI—as a predictive biomarker of risk for broad psychological vulnerability to commonly experienced stressful life events. Our neural risk biomarker predicted vulnerability consistent with a diathesis-stress model in both the short and long term as well as independently of negative reporting biases. Critically, we did not find a main effect of amygdala reactivity in predicting future internalizing symptoms, indicating that this neural biomarker predicts greater symptoms only within the context of experiencing relatively high life stress. Remarkably, amygdala reactivity measured at one time point significantly predicted internalizing symptoms, above and beyond baseline symptoms, as much as 1 to 4 years into the future, indicating possible utility of this neural phenotype for prediction of long-term internalizing outcomes. However, it is important to note that the interaction between amygdala reactivity and stress only explained an additional 1%–5% of the variance in symptoms, with the long-term model (Model B) evidencing the weakest effect. There are several methodological limitations of the current study that may have led us to underestimate the size of this effect. First, participants were not guaranteed payment for completing follow-up online assessments but entered into a larger gift card raffle. Thus, missing data may have biased our results. Second, life stress was assessed through a self-report checklist rather than through a more objective approach such as a calendar interview. Third, our non-clinical sample of undergraduate students was generally low-risk and the associated range and variability in internalizing symptoms truncated in comparison to clinical or high-risk samples. We anticipate that future research addressing these limitations may find larger effect sizes than those reported in the present study. Nevertheless, these results underscore the need to identify additional biomarkers, whether neural or genetic, that can explain additional variance in addition to or in interaction with that accounted for by threat-related amygdala reactivity. Notably, a range of previously identified risk factors for depression and anxiety disorders are all associated with relatively increased amygdala reactivity to threat (Bogdan et al., 2012Bogdan R. Williamson D.E. Hariri A.R. Mineralocorticoid receptor Iso/Val (rs5522) genotype moderates the association between previous childhood emotional neglect and amygdala reactivity.Am. J.

Although our follow-up assessments did not allow for direct mapping of threat-related amygdala reactivity onto formal clinical diagnosis, the increased stress-related symptoms of depression and anxiety predicted by amygdala reactivity have been directly associated with dysfunction (Bredemeier et al., 2010Bredemeier K. Spielberg J.M. Silton R.L. Berenbaum H. Heller W. Miller G.A.

Distinguishing between anxiety and depression using the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ).Br. J. Clin. Psychol. 2007; 46: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and relatively increased amygdala reactivity is consistently observed in patients with clinical depression and anxiety disorders (Etkin and Wager, 2007Etkin A. Wager T.D. Functional neuroimaging of anxiety: a meta-analysis of emotional processing in PTSD, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia.Am. J.

Emotional valence modulates brain functional abnormalities in depression: evidence from a meta-analysis of fMRI studies.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2013; 37: 152-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Thus, threat-related amygdala reactivity represents a predictive neural biomarker through which a range of risk factors may create a common diathesis for psychological vulnerability to the experience of common life stressors in the general population. As such, relatively increased threat-related amygdala reactivity further represents a discrete biological mechanism that can be targeted in the development of novel strategies for more effective prevention of otherwise chronic and treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. The amygdala, of course, represents only one node of an extended corticolimbic circuit supporting emotion processing and stress responsiveness. Other circuit nodes include the hypothalamus, brainstem, insula, hippocampal formation, and prefrontal cortex. Future research using paradigms designed to target these other circuit nodes as well as their dynamic interactions may further illuminate biological pathways through which individual differences in stress responsiveness may eventually manifest as disorder. Young adult college students were recruited as part of the Duke Neurogenetics Study. All procedures were approved by the Duke University Medical Center and participants provided informed consent before participating in the study. Participants were included in the present sample if they met the following criteria: (1) free of medical diagnoses of cancer, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney or liver disease, or lifetime history of psychotic symptoms; (2) no use of psychotropic, glucocorticoid, or hypolipidemic medication; (3) no conditions affecting cerebral blood flow and metabolism (e.g., hypertension); and (4) met quality control criteria for functional MRI scanning. Moreover, due to our interest in predicting internalizing symptoms post-scanning, we excluded any participants with a current mood, anxiety, or eating disorder diagnosis at the time of scanning, based on the electronic Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al., 1998Sheehan D.V.

A covariate was included in all analyses to control for participants with a non-internalizing diagnosis (e.g., substance abuse) or with a past internalizing diagnosis. A total of 811 participants met inclusion criteria for the imaging data (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for quality control criteria), 57 were excluded for current psychopathology, and 1 participant was missing data, leaving 753 participants (57% female) ranging in age from 18 to 22 available for analyses (Table 1).Table 1Participant CharacteristicsMeanSDMinMaxBaseline (n = 753)Age19.6 years1.2 years18 years22 yearsChildhood trauma33.27.92575Stressful life events Time 110.18.2066Internalizing symptoms Time 1110.725.461230Time 2 Scores: Model A (n = 340)Age20.8 years1.5 years18 years26 yearsStressful life events Time 24.35.3034Internalizing symptoms Time 2110.726.465214Days between imaging and assessment467.6326.7901402Time 2 Scores: Model B (n = 192)Age21.4 years1.4 years19 years26 yearsStressful life events Time 25.46.2034Internalizing symptoms Time 2111.627.265211Days between imaging and assessment683.0278.63651402Time 2 Scores: Model C (n = 99)Age20.5 years1.1 years19 years23 yearsStressful life events Time 23.34.2027.7Internalizing symptoms Time 2109.929.265230Days between imaging and assessment397.339.2365455Childhood trauma, total of all subscales of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; stressful life events, total impact score for all life events reported on the Life Events Scale for Students; internalizing symptoms, total of all subscales on the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire; SD, standard deviation.

Participants performed a face-matching task that has been shown to elicit robust amygdala reactivity across a range of studies and samples, including the present sample (Nikolova et al., 2014Nikolova Y.S. Koenen K.C. Galea S. Wang C.M. Seney M.L. Sibille E. Williamson D.E. Hariri A.R. Beyond genotype: serotonin transporter epigenetic modification predicts human brain function.Nat.

Impact of sleep quality on amygdala reactivity, negative affect, and perceived stress.Psychosom. Med. 2013; 75: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The current paradigm consisted of four blocks of face matching interleaved with five blocks of a shape-matching sensorimotor control task. During face-matching blocks, participants viewed a trio of faces and selected one of two faces (on bottom) matching a target face (on top). Each face block contained one of the following expressions: fearful, angry, surprised, and neutral. Each trial in the face-matching blocks lasted for 4 s with a variable interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2 to 6 s (M = 4 s), for a total block length of 48 s. In the control blocks, each of the six shape trios was presented for 4 s with a fixed ISI of 2 s, for a total block length of 36 s. Total task time was 390 s. Details regarding fMRI acquisition are reported in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Because we were interested in predicting the future development of internalizing symptoms, we controlled for internalizing symptoms at baseline using the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ) Short Form (Watson et al., 1995Watson D. Clark L.A. Weber K. Assenheimer J.S. Strauss M.E. McCormick R.A. Testing a tripartite model: II. Exploring the symptom structure of anxiety and depression in student, adult, and patient samples.J. Abnorm. Psychol. 1995; 104: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Scores across all subscales (general distress/depression, general distress/anxiety, anxious arousal, and anhedonia) were summed to create a measure of total internalizing symptoms. Likewise, because we were interested in the effect of life stress occurring post-scanning, we controlled for life stress reported at baseline. To assess life stress, we administered the Life Events Scale for Students (LESS; Clements and Turpin, 1996Clements K. Turpin G. The life events scale for students: Validation for use with British samples.Pers. Individ. Dif. 1996; 20: 747-751Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to participants to measure the number of life events that occurred in the past 12 months. Participants also rated the impact that the life event had on them on a 1 to 4 scale (4 = severe impact). The impact score for each event reported was summed to yield a LESS total impact score; higher values indicate both greater number and severity of life events. Additional covariates are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Participants were re-contacted post-scanning to complete follow-up assessments online every 3 months. Successful completers were entered into a raffle for one $50 Amazon gift card for each round of follow-up assessments. The same questions from the LESS were used to assess stressful life events in the post-scanning questionnaires; however, for these assessments participants were asked to report whether any life events had occurred since their last assessment. Participants also completed the MASQ Short Form during these post-scanning assessments. In accordance with our first model (Model A), we selected the most recent assessment available for all participants and obtained the life stress total impact score from the LESS and total internalizing symptoms from the MASQ at this most recent assessment. For Model B, we took a similar approach, except that we limited this model to those participants who had completed an assessment at least 1 year post-scanning. In accordance with our final model (Model C), we selected MASQ symptom scores from questionnaires completed approximately 1 year post-scanning (the inclusion range was set to 365–455 days post-scanning, to take into account the fact that participants may not have completed the assessment exactly 365 days post-scanning). We then computed the mean of the LESS impact score from each assessment completed before that (Figure 3A). Extra care was taken in quality control procedures for these assessments, given that they were administered online. Specifically, individual item responses were examined for any obvious patterns of false reporting (e.g., a participant indicates a yes for every stressful life event on the LESS). Attrition analyses are reported in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. fMRI data were processed in SPM8 using the standard pre-processing stream used in previously published research from the Duke Neurogenetics Study. Further details on the procedure and quality control criteria are reported in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. We hypothesized that results would be specific to threatening facial expressions (fearful and angry), thus the main contrast analyzed was fearful and angry faces > shapes. To examine the specificity of effects to negative expressions, we also ran analyses with parameter estimates for amygdala reactivity to neutral faces > shapes as a control condition, reported in the Supplemental Data. To obtain estimates of amygdala reactivity for each condition, we first identified functional clusters within the amygdala (defined structurally with the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas) activated at p < 0.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected within the region of interest for each condition in SPM8. Then, we extracted parameter estimates for the left and right amygdala for each condition. This procedure has been used in prior published research from the Duke Neurogenetics Study (Nikolova et al., 2012Nikolova Y.S. Bogdan R. Brigidi B.D. Hariri A.R. Ventral striatum reactivity to reward and recent life stress interact to predict positive affect.Biol.

Williamson D.E. Hariri A.R. Beyond genotype: serotonin transporter epigenetic modification predicts human brain function.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because left and right amygdala reactivity for our contrast of interest (fearful and angry faces > shapes) was highly correlated (r = 0.78, p < 0.001), we averaged across hemispheres to obtain one mean parameter estimate of amygdala reactivity and reduce the number of comparisons performed. Our hypothesis was that the association between amygdala reactivity and internalizing symptoms would be moderated by the amount of life stress experienced post-scanning. After parameter estimates of amygdala reactivity were extracted in SPM8, all subsequent analyses to test this proposed moderation model were performed in MPlus version 7. Thus, for Models A–C, MASQ total scores from the follow-up assessment were entered as the dependent variable, and extracted parameter estimates of amygdala reactivity, the total life stress impact score from follow-up, and the interaction between these were entered as predictors. The following were included as covariates: age at the most recent assessment, gender, childhood trauma total scores, LESS total impact scores from the baseline assessment, MASQ total scores at baseline, the psychopathology covariate, days between scanning and completing the follow-up questionnaire, and (for Model C only) the number of assessments contributing to the mean LESS total impact score. Predictors were mean centered. Because symptoms at Time 2 were moderately skewed, MLR estimation was specified to estimate standard errors robust to non-normality.

https://openalex.org/W2070998669,"What role does reward play in real-world human vision? Reward coding in the midbrain is thought to cause the rapid prioritization of reward-associated visual stimuli. However, existing evidence for this incentive salience hypothesis in vision is equivocal, particularly in naturalistic circumstances, and little is known about underlying neural systems. Here we use human fMRI to test whether reward primes perceptual encoding of naturalistic visual stimuli and to identify the neural mechanisms underlying this function. Participants detected a cued object category in briefly presented images of city- and landscapes. Using multivoxel pattern analysis in visual cortex, we found that the encoding of reward-associated targets was enhanced, whereas encoding of reward-associated distractors was suppressed, with the strength of this effect predicted by activity in the dopaminergic midbrain and a connected cortical network. These results identify a novel interaction between neural systems responsible for reward processing and visual perception in the human brain."

Brain imaging studies in humans implicate the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in regulating the conflict between goals and distractors. Here we show that single dACC neurons signal conflict between task goals and distractors in the rhesus macaque, particularly for biologically relevant social stimuli. For some neurons, task conflict signals predicted subsequent changes in pupil size—a peripheral index of arousal linked to noradrenergic tone—associated with reduced distractor interference. dACC neurons also responded to errors, and these signals predicted adjustments in pupil size. These findings provide the first neurophysiological endorsement of the hypothesis that dACC regulates conflict, in part, via modulation of pupil-linked processes such as arousal. Whether driving a car, shopping for food, or paying attention in a classroom of boisterous teenagers, it’s often hard to maintain focus on goals in the face of distraction.

These findings provide the first neurophysiological endorsement of the hypothesis that dACC regulates conflict, in part, via modulation of pupil-linked processes such as arousal. Humans and other animals preferentially process information that has predicted biologically relevant events, either in personal or evolutionary history. For example, both sudden onset stimuli (Remington et al., 1992Remington R.W. Johnston J.C. Yantis S. Involuntary attentional capture by abrupt onsets.Percept. Psychophys. 1992; 51: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and social stimuli such as faces (Cerf et al., 2009Cerf M. Frady E.P. Koch C.

Thus, pursuing important goals like foraging in complex, dynamic environments may require regulation of conflicting demands on attention and action. Understanding how this conflict between prepotent processing of salient distractors and goal pursuit is regulated may help to develop new treatments for disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or schizophrenia, in which these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted, as well as to devise new strategies for improving performance in school or attention-demanding jobs like air-traffic control. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) appears to contribute to managing conflict and regulating focus in humans. Functional and anatomical differences in dACC accompany disorders of distractibility (Bush et al., 1999Bush G. Frazier J.A. Rauch S.L. Seidman L.J. Whalen P.J. Jenike M.A. Rosen B.R. Biederman J.

In humans, conflict signals are apparent in the firing rates of single dACC neurons (Sheth et al., 2012Sheth S.A. Mian M.K. Patel S.R. Asaad W.F. Williams Z.M. Dougherty D.D. Bush G. Eskandar E.N.

This disconnect may reflect methodological differences in studies in monkeys and humans. Conflict paradigms used in humans typically evoke conflict at both the level of the task set (“task conflict”) and the physical action (“action conflict”), while studies in monkeys focus on action conflict (Ito et al., 2003Ito S.

Olson C.R. Neuronal activity in macaque SEF and ACC during performance of tasks involving conflict.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 884-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Alternatively, conflict signaling may be a unique feature of human dACC (Cole et al., 2009Cole M.W. Yeung N. Freiwald W.A. Botvinick M. Cingulate cortex: diverging data from humans and monkeys.Trends Neurosci. 2009; 32: 566-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It also remains unclear how conflict signals in dACC translate into subsequent adjustments in behavioral regulation. One hint is that conflict is not the only task condition that elicits dACC activation. Error signals are commonly reported in dACC in both humans (Carter et al., 1998Carter C.S. Braver T.S.

One pathway by which dACC could shape behavioral control is via subcortical projections to regions implicated in arousal, a state of physiological activation, characterized by pupil dilation and increased heart rate, blood pressure, and perspiration (Kandel et al., 2000Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessell T.M. Principles of Neural Science. Volume 4. McGraw-Hill, New York2000Google Scholar). Arousal is associated with increased reactivity to goal-irrelevant stimuli (Ebitz et al., 2014Ebitz R.B. Pearson J.M. Platt M.L. Pupil size and social vigilance in rhesus macaques.Front.

Pupil size thus provides a potentially useful measure to test the hypothesis that dACC adjusts cognitive control, in part, by regulating processes like autonomic arousal and/or NE tone. We tested these ideas in an animal model in which the precise temporal dynamics of dACC neuronal activity can be linked to behavioral performance and pupil dynamics. To do this, we recorded from single neurons in dACC and tracked pupil size in monkeys making goal-directed saccades for juice reward while periodically confronting them with biologically salient distractors. We previously showed that large pupil size at fixation predicts increased distractor interference in this task (Ebitz et al., 2014Ebitz R.B. Pearson J.M. Platt M.L. Pupil size and social vigilance in rhesus macaques.Front. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 100Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting a modulatory role for pupil-linked processes in conflict regulation. We used faces as distractors because they supersede other stimuli for attention in primates (Cerf et al., 2009Cerf M. Frady E.P. Koch C.

USA. 2013; 110: 11630-11635Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), require no training to acquire salience, and continue to intrude on task performance over tens of thousands of trials. Single neuron recordings allowed us to determine the distribution of distractor and pupil size signals within the smallest functional subunits of dACC, which constrains the computations the region could perform. We also examined the relationship between error signals and pupil size signals within single neurons in order to determine how they are linked. Distractors could be in one of three locations relative to the rewarded target. Specific contrasts across these locations allowed us to differentiate between signals related to different forms of conflict. There is no single accepted operational definition of conflict, and definitions have not always been consistent between studies in humans and monkeys. Our task evokes two types of conflict. First, as is typically done in studies in monkeys (Ito et al., 2003Ito S. Stuphorn V. Brown J.W. Schall J.D. Performance monitoring by the anterior cingulate cortex during saccade countermanding.Science. 2003; 302: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, Amiez et al., 2006Amiez C. Joseph J.P.

Olson C.R. Neuronal activity in macaque SEF and ACC during performance of tasks involving conflict.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 884-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we examined conflict evoked when opposing saccade plans are simultaneously active, by manipulating the relative physical locations of a rewarded target and an irrelevant distractor. This “action conflict” was operationalized as slowing of saccade initiation when a distractor appeared in a location incongruent with the location of the saccade target. Second, we examined the intrusion of prepotent, task-irrelevant information on goal pursuit, a second form of conflict that may also be induced in Stroop or flanker tasks used in studies of conflict in humans (Botvinick et al., 1999Botvinick M.

Here we define “task conflict” as any change in task performance induced by distractors, irrespective of their spatial location or saccade congruence (see also Supplemental Information). We found that firing rates of single neurons in dACC differentiated between distractors that impacted task performance and those that did not, demonstrating for the first time that dACC neurons signal conflict in the macaque. Importantly, the primary conflict signal we observed was task conflict. By contrast, action conflict signals were absent in the initial time-locked distractor response and heterogeneously signed across the dACC population, consistent with previous reports in monkeys (Ito et al., 2003Ito S. Stuphorn V. Brown J.W. Schall J.D. Performance monitoring by the anterior cingulate cortex during saccade countermanding.Science. 2003; 302: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, Amiez et al., 2006Amiez C. Joseph J.P.

Olson C.R. Neuronal activity in macaque SEF and ACC during performance of tasks involving conflict.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 884-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We also addressed the functional significance of task conflict signals in dACC for changes in pupil size. We found a decrease in pupil diameter on trials following both distractors and errors, consistent with long-term and potentially homeostatic downregulation of arousal. Across the dACC population, some neurons responded to distractors and/or errors, some scaled their responses with pupil size, and others signaled information about task events on the current trial and predicted subsequent adjustments in pupil diameter on the next trial. Thus, the dACC population signals information about multiple aspects of task performance, including task conflict, errors, and current pupil size, and predicts subsequent adjustments in pupil size associated with reduced distraction. These findings endorse the hypothesis that dACC contributes to cognitive control, in part, through pupil-linked changes in arousal. In the social interference task (Figure 1B), distractors (intact and phase-scrambled faces; Figure 1B) were briefly flashed (67 ms) during visually guided saccades. On a subset of trials, distractors were also flashed during the ITI (“ITI distractors”) to dissociate neural responses to distraction during task performance from responses to a flashed image (Ito et al., 2003Ito S. Stuphorn V. Brown J.W. Schall J.D. Performance monitoring by the anterior cingulate cortex during saccade countermanding.Science. 2003; 302: 120-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Task distractors were spatially congruent, incongruent, or in a neutral position relative to the target. Interference of distractors on task performance was affected by their location (p < 0.0001, F[1,2] = 204.79) and social content (Figure 1C; interaction with location p < 0.02, F[1,2] = 3.99). Neutral distractors did not influence saccade response time (<1.5 ms different from absent response times, ±4 ms across session STE; p > 0.5). Incongruent distractors slowed response times (p < 0.0001; average slowing = 47 ± 7 ms), but congruent distractors speeded response times (p < 0.0001, post hoc Tukey LSD compared to distractor absent trials; average facilitation = 25 ± 3 ms). Distractors also evoked errant saccades not directed toward the target (14.5% following distractors ± 2% STE versus 8% ± 2% without distractors; p < 0.0001, paired Wilcoxon rank sum, z[55] = 6.31). Errant saccades were more frequent after both congruent (11% ± 2%; p < 0.002, z[55] = 3.20) and incongruent distractors (24.6% ± 2%; p < 0.0001, z[55] = 6.48) compared to neutral distractors (9.5% ± 2%; paired Wilcoxon rank sum tests). Social distractors (intact faces) evoked greater response time effects than nonsocial distractors (phase-scrambled faces). Incongruent social distractors slowed response times more than incongruent nonsocial distractors (13 ms slower, ± 5 ms STE; p < 0.05, Tukey LSD), and there was a trend toward congruent social distractors speeding response times relative to congruent nonsocial distractors (7 ms faster, ± 3 ms STE; p = 0.06, Tukey LSD). Across all distractor locations, errant saccades were more common for social distractors (15.5% ± 2%) than for nonsocial distractors (13.5% ± 2%; paired Wilcoxon rank sum, p < 0.0001, z[55] = 3.90). Both congruent and incongruent distractors affected response time and errant saccade likelihood, relative to both neutral distractors and the distractor absent baseline. Although congruent distractors sped target responses, they did so by capturing oculomotor resources, not by enhancing target detection or processing (Supplemental Information). Therefore both of these distractor types intruded on task performance and evoked task conflict. By contrast, action conflict arises from simultaneous preparation of different saccades and is manifest by slowed response times following incongruent distractors. Thus, in this task, congruent and incongruent distractors together evoke task conflict, but only incongruent distractors evoke action conflict. Social distractors increased both action conflict and task conflict, relative to nonsocial distractors. Pupil size during fixation (Figure 2A) predicted the magnitude of distractor effects on errant saccade likelihood and response times. As baseline pupil size increased, the proportion of trials with errant saccades also increased, regardless of distractor location (Figure 2B; GLM, interaction term, p < 0.05, β3 = 0.001, see Equation 1 in Experimental Procedures). Baseline pupil size did not predict errant saccade frequency in absence of distractors (p > 0.66), suggesting an increase in distractibility rather than a lower threshold for saccade initiation with increasing pupil size. Increasing pupil size also magnified the response time effec"

The Centers for Disease Control have estimated that approximately 10% to 20% of individuals may experience Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome – a set of symptoms including fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and neurocognitive complaints that persist after initial antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease. Little is known about the impact of Lyme disease or post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms (PTLDS) on health care costs and utilization in the United States. Objectives 1) to examine the impact of Lyme disease on health care costs and utilization, 2) to understand the relationship between Lyme disease and the probability of developing PTLDS, 3) to understand how PTLDS may impact health care costs and utilization. Methods This study utilizes retrospective data on medical claims and member enrollment for persons aged 0-64 years who were enrolled in commercial health insurance plans in the United States between 2006-2010. 52,795 individuals treated for Lyme disease were compared to 263,975 matched controls with no evidence of Lyme disease exposure. Results Lyme disease is associated with $2,968 higher total health care costs (95% CI: 2,807-3,128, p<.001) and 87% more outpatient visits (95% CI: 86%-89%, p<.001) over a 12-month period, and is associated with 4.77 times greater odds of having any PTLDS-related diagnosis, as compared to controls (95% CI: 4.67-4.87, p<.001). Among those with Lyme disease, having one or more PTLDS-related diagnosis is associated with $3,798 higher total health care costs (95% CI: 3,542-4,055, p<.001) and 66% more outpatient visits (95% CI: 64%-69%, p<.001) over a 12-month period, relative to those with no PTLDS-related diagnoses. Conclusions Lyme disease is associated with increased costs above what would be expected for an easy to treat infection. The presence of PTLDS-related diagnoses after treatment is associated with significant health care costs and utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2054989395,"Glutamate transporters terminate neurotransmission by clearing synaptically released glutamate from the extracellular space, allowing repeated rounds of signalling and preventing glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Crystallographic studies of a glutamate transporter homologue from the archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii, GltPh, showed that distinct transport domains translocate substrates into the cytoplasm by moving across the membrane within a central trimerization scaffold. Here we report direct observations of these ‘elevator-like’ transport domain motions in the context of reconstituted proteoliposomes and physiological ion gradients using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging. We show that GltPh bearing two mutations introduced to impart characteristics of the human transporter exhibits markedly increased transport domain dynamics, which parallels an increased rate of substrate transport, thereby establishing a direct temporal relationship between transport domain motion and substrate uptake. Crystallographic and computational investigations corroborated these findings by revealing that the ‘humanizing’ mutations favour structurally ‘unlocked’ intermediate states in the transport cycle exhibiting increased solvent occupancy at the interface between the transport domain and the trimeric scaffold. An analysis of a bacterial homologue of the human glutamate transporter using single-molecule FRET and X-ray crystallography reveals that opening of the interface between its distinct transport and scaffold domains is rate determining for the transport cycle. In this manuscript, the authors use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations to probe the dynamics of GltPh, an aspartate transporter from the archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii, and of a double mutant form of the enzyme that has a lower affinity for the substrate, but an increased rate of substrate transport. GltPh is a homologue of the glutamate transporters that play an important role in neural transmission by maintaining low concentrations of neurotransmitter within synapses in the brain, and the two mutations bring the enzyme closer in action to the human equivalent. The structures reveal that opening of the interface between GltPh's distinct transport and scaffold domains — linked to the transition between between outward- and inward-facing states — are directly correlated with the rate of substrate transport."

These results uncover a conserved strategy regulating temporal identity transitions from flies to mammals. In the developing nervous system, various neuronal and glial cell types are generated from multipotent progenitor cells in a specific chronological sequence. Key to this process is the ability of progenitors to change their “temporal identity” as development proceeds, such that they gain or lose the competence to generate specific cell types at the appropriate developmental stage (Kohwi and Doe, 2013Kohwi M.

The alteration of progenitor output over time is a classical feature of the developing vertebrate retina, in which multipotent RPCs give rise to elaborate lineages consisting of many different classes of neurons and one glial cell type in a specific order. Cone photoreceptor, horizontal, and ganglion cells are mostly generated in the earliest phase of retinogenesis, closely followed by amacrine cells, and later by rod photoreceptor, bipolar, and Müller glial cells (Rapaport et al., 2004Rapaport D.H.

While the mechanisms regulating the production of each individual fate upon cell-cycle exit are beginning to be elucidated, how exactly RPCs change their identity over time remains poorly understood (Cepko, 2014Cepko C.

Mechanistically, regulation of temporal identity in neural progenitors is best understood in invertebrate systems. In Drosophila neuroblast lineages, several transcription factor cascades have been shown to alter temporal identity over developmental time (Baumgardt et al., 2009Baumgardt M. Karlsson D.

Doe C.Q. Regulation of neuroblast competence in Drosophila.Nature. 2003; 425: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the zinc finger transcription factor Ikzf1 (Ikaros/Znfn1a1), an ortholog of Drosophila hb, is necessary and sufficient to confer early temporal identity in RPCs (Elliott et al., 2008Elliott J. Jolicoeur C. Ramamurthy V. Cayouette M. Ikaros confers early temporal competence to mouse retinal progenitor cells.Neuron. 2008; 60: 26-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It remains unknown, however, what might confer later temporal identity in RPCs, and whether transcription factor cascades similarly to those used in flies might constitute a general mechanism regulating temporal patterning in vertebrates. A mouse gene homologous to Drosophila cas, named Casz1, is expressed in the retina (Blackshaw et al., 2004Blackshaw S. Harpavat S. Trimarchi J. Cai L. Huang H. Kuo W.P. Weber G. Lee K. Fraioli R.E. Cho S.H. et al.Genomic analysis of mouse retinal development.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E247Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), but the function of Casz1 in the vertebrate nervous system has yet to be examined. Here, we demonstrate that Casz1 lies downstream of Ikzf1 and is essential for conferring mid/late temporal identity in murine RPCs, suggesting conservation of the temporal identity cascade used in flies. Through genome homology searches, we found that a single gene homologous to the Drosophila temporal identify factor cas exists in vertebrates, named Casz1. Like cas, Casz1 encodes multiple unusual C2H2C2H2 zinc finger domains (Figure 1A). The Casz1 locus generates two alternative transcripts, Casz1v1 and Casz1v2, which share an identical N-terminal cluster of four highly conserved C2H2C2H2 domains and a fifth more divergent domain. Casz1v1 additionally contains six divergent C2H2C2H2 motifs (Figure 1A). Thus, since Casz1 is the definitive ortholog of Drosophila cas, and its function has not been explored in the nervous system, we hypothesized that it might play an analogous role in regulating temporal identity in mouse RPCs. We first studied Casz1 transcript and protein expression during retinogenesis. Casz1 was barely detectable during early stages of retinogenesis but increased between embyronic day 14.5 (E14.5) and E16.5 (Figures 1B and 1C; Figures S1A and S1B). During intermediate stages of retinogenesis (E16.5–postnatal day 0 [P0]), Casz1 was almost completely restricted to the progenitor layer (Figures 1C–1E) but became more prominent in differentiating photoreceptors by P4 (Figure 1F; Figure S1) and remained expressed in adult rods and cones (Figure 1G; Figures S1A and S1B). Interestingly, no difference in the expression pattern of Casz1v1 and Casz1v2 was noted at any stage (Figure S1B). Co-stainings at E16.5 and P0 revealed that Casz1 is expressed in almost all proliferating Vsx2+/Ki67+ RPCs during mid-phase retinogenesis (Figures 1H–1O). A few Casz1+;Ki67− cells were also found, however, suggesting Casz1 expression in differentiating cells. Accordingly, Otx2, a marker of committed rod photoreceptor precursors during postnatal stages of retinogenesis, was extensively co-expressed with Casz1 at the apical margin of the progenitor layer (Figures 1P–1S). Conversely, precursors for early-born cell types, such as Lhx1+ horizontal cells and Pou4f+ (Brn3) RGCs did not express Casz1 (data not shown). Finally, by P4, Casz1 was restricted to Otx2+ rod precursors and was undetectable in Ki67+/Otx2− RPCs (Figures 1T–1W). In summary, Casz1 protein is expressed from mid/late stages in RPCs and is maintained in differentiating rod precursors and mature rods. Additionally, Casz1 is found in postmitotic early-born cones and a small subset of GABAergic amacrine cells (Figure S2), suggesting other functions of Casz1 in terminally differentiated neurons. These results indicate a high correlation between mid/late RPC temporal identity and Casz1 expression. To elucidate the function of Casz1 in the developing murine retina, we generated Casz1 mouse mutant alleles. Casz1SALacZ is predicted to be a null allele by causing premature transcription arrest before the zinc finger domains (Figure 2A). Accordingly, no viable Casz1SALacZ/SALacZ homozygotes were found in E10.5 litters (wild-type: 10/33; Casz1SALacZ/+: 21/33; Casz1SALacZ/SALacZ: 0/33) or after birth (n = 0/115), consistent with the previously reported essential role for Casz1 in heart and vascular system development (Charpentier et al., 2013Charpentier M.S.

Taking advantage of the Casz1SALacZ/+ allele, we studied the general expression pattern of the Casz1 locus in developing embryos. In the retina, β-Gal was expressed in a pattern consistent with what we observed by in situ hybridization (Figures S1A and S1B), while whole embryo staining revealed β-Gal expression in the developing heart and arteries, as well as the dorsal neural tube and somatic sensory neurons (Figures S1C–S1E). Since Casz1 deletion is lethal prior to eye formation, we converted Casz1SALacZ into a conditional Casz1Flox allele using the FRT/flipase system in vivo. To monitor Cre-mediated recombination, we additionally introduced a reporter allele (R26-EYFP). Since our goal was to study the role of Casz1 in the development of individual lineages, we first inactivated Casz1 clonally in RPCs using retroviral vector-mediated Cre expression. We infected E13.5 Casz1Flox/+; R26-EYFP or Casz1Flox/Flox; R26-EYFP littermate retinal explants and analyzed the size and composition of resulting viral heterozygote (v-Het) or conditional knockout (v-cKO) clones 20 days later, when retinal development is complete (Figure 2E). Strikingly, we found that early-born fates such as horizontal, amacrine, and cone cells were significantly overrepresented in v-cKO clones, whereas mid-/late-born rods were significantly reduced (Figures 2F–2J; Tables S1 and S2). In contrast, later-born bipolar cells were not affected and Müller glia were increased. It is therefore likely that many Casz1 cKO RPCs that fail to adopt the rod fate default to Müller glia, as this is the latest fate in the temporal sequence. These results suggest that Casz1 suppresses early temporal competence as well as progression into the final temporal state, which is consistent with our finding that RPCs do not express Casz1 during the latest stages of retinogenesis (Figures 1T–1W). Importantly, the overall size distribution of v-cKO clones was unchanged compared to controls (Figure 2K), indicating that Casz1 does not function by regulating the timing of cell-cycle exit or cell death. We next wanted to study the impact of Casz1 inactivation on overall retinal development in vivo. To do this, we crossed the α-Pax6::Cre mouse line, which expresses Cre recombinase in peripheral RPCs from E10.5 (Marquardt et al., 2001Marquardt T. Ashery-Padan R. Andrejewski N. Scardigli R. Guillemot F. Gruss P. Pax6 is required for the multipotent state of retinal progenitor cells.Cell. 2001; 105: 43-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), into the Casz1Flox/Flox; R26-EYFP background to generate retina-specific Casz1 conditional knockouts (α-cKO) (Figure 2A). As expected, α-cKO animals were viable in normal Mendelian ratios, and Casz1 protein was lost in almost all EYFP+ cells (Figures 2B–2D), validating the knockout strategy and confirming the specificity of our antibodies. Consistent with the clonal analysis, adult-staged (∼P40–P80) α-cKO animals had fewer rod photoreceptor cells in the peripheral retina where Cre is expressed (control: 68.93% ± 0.63% of total cells, n = 6; α-cKO: 60.08% ± 0.08%, n = 6; p < 0.0001; Figure S3). The fraction of inner nuclear layer (INL) cells, which includes both interneurons and Müller glia, was concomitantly increased (control: 26.28% ± 0.47%, n = 6; α-cKO INL: 33.07% ± 0.42%, n = 6; p = 0.0013; Figure S3). More specifically, early-born fates like amacrines, cones, as well as ganglion cells, which could not be studied in the v-cKO clones because they rapidly degenerate in explants, were all increased in P0 or P21 α-cKO retinas in vivo (Table S3; Figure S3). Thus, cell fate alterations in α-cKO retinas are consistent with what we observed upon clonal inactivation of Casz1 (increased early fates at the expense of mid-/late-born rods), albeit less severe. It is well-known, however, that multiple pathways can compensate for changes in cell proportions in the retina in vivo, including feedback and apoptosis-mediated mechanisms (Brzezinski et al., 2010Brzezinski 4th, J.A.

Retinal ganglion cell-derived sonic hedgehog locally controls proliferation and the timing of RGC development in the embryonic mouse retina.Development. 2005; 132: 5103-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and it is likely that such compensatory mechanisms are operating when Casz1 is inactivated in a large population of cells, as in the α-cKO retinas. Interestingly, in much older (∼P230) α-cKO retinas, we noted extensive degeneration of the photoreceptor layer (Figures S3G and S3H), suggesting an additional role for Casz1 in the maintenance of mature photoreceptor cells. To test whether Casz1 is sufficient to promote the generation of mid-/late-born fates, we used retroviral vectors to misexpress each isoform of Casz1 in RPCs at E13.5, a stage prior to the upregulation of Casz1 expression. Three weeks later, Casz1v1-overexpressing clones contained normal proportions of rods but nearly double the number of bipolar cells compared to controls (Figures 3A–3D and 3G ; Table S1). Casz1v2, in contrast, had no effect on bipolar cell production but significantly increased rod photoreceptor production (Figures 3E–3G; Tables S1 and S2). The increase in mid-/late-born rods and bipolars came both at the expense of early fates, such as amacrines, horizontals, and cones and also at the expense of the last-born Müller glial cells (Figure 3G). As observed upon Casz1 inactivation, we found no effect on clone size distribution after overexpressing either Casz1 isoform (Figure 3H), reinforcing the idea that Casz1 alters RPC output independently of proliferation or apoptosis. In Drosophila, hb acts as a repressor to suppress cas expression and, conversely, when hb is converted to an obligatory activator by fusing it to the VP16 activation domain, it upregulates cas expression (Tran et al., 2010Tran K.D. Miller M.R. Doe C.Q. Recombineering Hunchback identifies two conserved domains required to maintain neuroblast competence and specify early-born neuronal identity.Development. 2010; 137: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered whether Ikzf1 might similarly regulate Casz1 expression. To test this idea, we generated Ikzf1 and Ikzf1-VP16 constructs and first transfected them into P0 RPCs to test their effect on fate. After 14 days, RPCs transfected with Ikzf1 generated an unusually large number of early-born Pax6+ amacrine/horizontal cells and few rods, as previously reported (Elliott et al., 2008Elliott J. Jolicoeur C. Ramamurthy V. Cayouette M. Ikaros confers early temporal competence to mouse retinal progenitor cells.Neuron. 2008; 60: 26-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ikzf1-VP16 appeared to behave as a dominant negative, as transfected RPCs generated primarily latest-born Ccnd3+ Müller glia (Figures 4A–4H). To determine whether Ikzf1 regulates endogenous Casz1 expression in mouse RPCs, we transfected Ikzf1 or Ikzf1-VP16 and studied Casz1 expression levels in transfected cells. As predicted, Ikzf1 led to a significant repression of Casz1, whereas Ikzf1-VP16 upregulated Casz1 expression relative to untransfected neighboring cells (Figures 4I–4O). To determine whether this regulation was direct, we screened the Casz1 locus for cis regulatory modules (CRMs) that might mediate the transcriptional effects of Ikzf1 (Figures S4A–S4G). To do this, we examined various published chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets for transcription factors implicated in retinal development, reasoning that consistent ChIP-seq peaks in Casz1 would correspond to potential regulatory regions. In this way, we identified CRM1 and CRM2, located within intron 2 and 3 of Casz1, respectively (Figures S4A–S4D). Both CRMs contained conserved Crx ChIP-seq peaks (Corbo et al., 2010Corbo J.C. Lawrence K.A. Karlstetter M. Myers C.A. Abdelaziz M. Dirkes W. Weigelt K. Seifert M. Benes V. Fritsche L.G. et al.CRX ChIP-seq reveals the cis-regulatory architecture of mouse photoreceptors.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 1512-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and CRM2 additionally contained conserved binding sites for Sox2 and Otx2 (Buecker et al., 2014Buecker C. Srinivasan R. Wu Z. Calo E. Acampora D. Faial T. Simeone A. Tan M. Swigut T. Wysocka J.

SOX2 co-occupies distal enhancer elements with distinct POU factors in ESCs and NPCs to specify cell state.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003288Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To study the activity of these CRMs in RPCs, we generated CRM::mGFP reporter constructs, as well as an ∼550 bp Casz1 promoter::EGFP construct (PR::EGFP). These CRM constructs, as well as control GFP constructs, were electroporated in the retina at P0, along with mCherry to monitor transfection efficiency. Both CMR2::mGFP and PR::EGFP were able to drive GFP expression in a pattern similar to Casz1 (Figures S4H–S4K), while CRM1::mGFP or control vectors did not yield any GFP expression (Figures S4L–S4N). Interestingly, both CRM2::mGFP and PR::EGFP constructs were strongly repressed by Ikzf1 in RPCs, but neither element was activated by Ikzf1-VP16 (Figures S4O–S4T). Since Ikzf1-VP16 upregulates Casz1, but cannot affect Ikzf1-sensitive regulatory elements, we conclude that Ikzf1 and Ikzf1-VP16 regulatory activities are probably routed independently and thus indirectly. Together, these results indicate that Ikzf1 sits upstream of Casz1 in a functionally similar epistatic relationship to that of hb and cas in Drosophila. There has been much progress over the past few years to identify factors that promote the production of individual neural cell types, but how exactly the intrinsic potential of neural progenitor cells change over time to regulate histogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we identify the zinc finger protein Casz1 as an important regulator of temporal identity in mouse RPCs. We find that Casz1 is expressed in mid-stage RPCs and is necessary and sufficient to regulate the balance of early- versus late-born cell types in the developing retina. Moreover, we demonstrate that Ikzf1 regulates Casz1 expression, suggesting that the regulatory logic of the fly hb >>> cas temporal identity cascade is conserved in mice. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, neural progenitors use time as a cue to alter their output. Reconstruction of randomly sampled vertebrate RPC lineages, both in clonal culture or in vivo, did not reveal deterministic behavior and instead suggested a model in which RPCs divide or differentiate into specific cell types according to biased probabilities that change over time but remain fixed for multiple cell generations (Gomes et al., 2011Gomes F.L. Zhang G. Carbonell F. Correa J.A. Harris W.A. Simons B.D. Cayouette M. Reconstruction of rat retinal progenitor cell lineages in vitro reveals a surprising degree of stochasticity in cell fate decisions.Development. 2011; 138: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, He et al., 2012He J.

The molecular effectors that change biases over time to produce mostly early- or late-born fates at the appropriate stage, however, have remained unknown. We propose that Ikzf1 and Casz1 have this role in mammalian RPCs (Figure 4P). Such a model is consistent with observations that loss or gain of function of either Ikzf1 or Casz1 alters the balance of early- versus later-born cell types without affecting lineage size, and that loss of either gene leads to a decrease but not a complete absence of cell types associated to a given temporal window. Additionally, ectopic expression of Ikzf1 or Casz1 increases the propensity to generate early- or mid-born cell types, respectively, but does not completely abolish the competence to produce cell types associated to a different temporal window. This suggests that Ikzf1 and Casz1 function non-deterministically to confer specific temporal identities to RPCs during which they are more or less biased to give rise to specific combinations of cell types: early fates during the Ikzf1 expression window and later fates during the Casz1 expression window. Our data suggest that Casz1 confers a mid-phase temporal identity to RPCs. While our preconception was that Casz1 should control late temporal competence, the upregulation of Casz1 in RPCs occurs considerably earlier than would be expected. Casz1 upregulation coincides with the onset of (1) the decline in early fate production and (2) rod generation (Rapaport et al., 2004Rapaport D.H. Wong L.L. Wood E.D. Yasumura D. LaVail M.M. Timing and topography of cell genesis in the rat retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 474: 304-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). While rods, bipolars, and Müllers are all generated from RPCs during the Casz1 expression window, rod production peaks toward the end of the Casz1 expression window, whereas bipolar and Müller cell production peaks several days after. Casz1-mediated suppression of Müller production is therefore consistent with Casz1 suppressing both the early and latest temporal identities. Overexpression of Casz1 probably expands the mid temporal window into the late Müller-producing window, thereby causing a decrease in Müller glia. Conversely, inactivation of Casz1 most likely triggers the late temporal window to start earlier than normal, thereby leading to an overproduction of Müller glia (Figure 4P). It remains unclear, however, why bipolar cells are not suppressed upon Casz1 inactivation. One potential explanation is that Casz1 alters the balance between early- and late-born bipolar cell subtypes, as there is evidence for temporal regulation of subtype production (Morrow et al., 2008Morrow E.M. Chen C.M. Cepko C.L. Temporal order of bipolar cell genesis in the neural retina.Neural Dev. 2008; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the actions of Casz1 are confined solely to neurogenesis and/or that the tendency of Müller glia to be produced at the end of RPC lineages accounts for the observed difference. Future experiments will be required to distinguish between these possibilities. An interesting observation in this study is the differential effects of Casz1 isoforms. At present, we have only a preliminary understanding of why Casz1v1 and Casz1v2 achieve different effects on cell fate. We found in pilot experiments that the genes most differentially regulated by the two isoforms are Ascl1 and Vsx2, two determinants of bipolar cells. Ascl1 was repressed in cells overexpressing Casz1v2, while Vsx2 was upregulated in cells overexpressing Casz1v1 (data not shown), suggesting a potential explanation, but the data remain to be corroborated and validated functionally. While our data do not completely exclude the possibility that Casz1 acts as a traditional fate determinant, we suggest that Casz1 is a bona fide temporal identity factor since (1) Casz1 is expressed in virtually all RPCs within its expression window, whereas the expression of fate determinants tends to be restricted to specific committed precursors, (2) Casz1 does not affect proliferation of RPCs, implying that it does not determine a specific cell identity, whereas fate determinants usually trigger cell-cycle exit to induce differentiation, and (3) Casz1 overexpression promotes rods and bipolar cells, rather than a single cell type. These features are highly reminiscent of the regulation of temporal competence by Drosophila cas, suggesting functional and perhaps mechanistic conservation. Our finding that Ikzf1 negatively regulates Casz1 expression provides a mechanism by which the appropriate sequential expression of each temporal identity factor is controlled in RPCs, analogous to the logic used to control temporal identity in fly neuroblasts. Previous functional analysis of Ikzf1 in retinogenesis revealed that Ikzf1 is necessary and sufficient to confer early competence to RPCs, but it remained unclear whether this biasing activity represented true conservation of the Drosophila temporal fate determination system or was merely coincidence. In this study, we show that Casz1 acts downstream of Ikzf1 in RPCs to promote later neuronal fates. Moreover, just as repressor activities of hb are required for its temporal functions, we show that Ikzf1 similarly acts as a repressor, since Ikzf1-VP16 acts oppositely to overproduce late fates. Nonetheless, the effect of Ikzf1-VP16 on late fate production is different than that of ectopic Casz1 expression. While Ikzf1-VP16-mediated induction of Casz1 might contribute to these effects, the observed overproduction of Müller glia along with our failure to observe sustained Casz1 induction at later time points (data not shown) suggests that Ikzf1-VP16 regulates additional target genes and/or accelerates RPC maturation into the terminal Casz1-negative state. Thus, an analogous transcription factor cascade appears to control temporal competence during vertebrate CNS development. However, our observations suggest that there are also important differences between the murine and fly temporal cascades, including that (1) murine temporal factors act as biasing factors to repress or promote certain fates without completely abolishing the competence to produce fates associated to other temporal windows, whereas Drosophila factors appear to act more deterministically to suppress alternative fates entirely, (2) murine factors regulate competence windows but do not entirely control them, and (3) interactions between mouse cascade members appear to be much less rigid than their Drosophila counterparts. However, it must be emphasized that other factors may lie in between Ikzf1 and Casz1 in the mouse cascade. Orthologs of pdm in mice, for example, belong to a family of Pou-domain-containing transcription factors (Pou2f family) that have not been studied in the retina, and there are hundreds of putative Kr orthologs. It will be important to determine whether these candidates are part of the same temporal cascade as Ikzf1 and Casz1. Since Ikzf1 was recently shown to control early-born neuronal fates in the cerebral cortex (Alsiö et al., 2013Alsiö J.M. Tarchini B. Cayouette M. Livesey F.J. Ikaros promotes early-born neuronal fates in the cerebral cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E716-E725Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and Casz1 is expressed in other regions of the nervous system such as the dorsal spinal cord and medial telencephalon (Liu et al., 2014Liu Z. Li W. Ma X. Ding N. Spallotta F. Southon E. Tessarollo L. Gaetano C. Mukouyama Y.S. Thiele C.J.

Chem. 2014; 289: 29801-29816Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar; Figure S1), it will be interesting to determine whether this system is generally used to control temporal patterning in other regions of the nervous system.

The prevailing view holds that this disorder impairs consciousness by seizure spread to the bilateral temporal lobes. We propose instead that seizures invade subcortical regions and depress arousal, causing impairment through decreases rather than through increases in activity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a rodent model, we found increased activity in regions known to depress cortical function, including lateral septum and anterior hypothalamus. Importantly, we found suppression of intralaminar thalamic and brainstem arousal systems and suppression of the cortex. At a cellular level, we found reduced firing of identified cholinergic neurons in the brainstem pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and basal forebrain. Finally, we used enzyme-based amperometry to demonstrate reduced cholinergic neurotransmission in both cortex and thalamus. Decreased subcortical arousal is a critical mechanism for loss of consciousness in focal temporal lobe seizures."

https://openalex.org/W1987119905,"Mitochondrial carriers, including uncoupling proteins, are unstable in detergents, which hampers structural and mechanistic studies. To investigate carrier stability, we have purified ligand-free carriers and assessed their stability with a fluorescence-based thermostability assay that monitors protein unfolding with a thiol-reactive dye. We find that mitochondrial carriers from both mesophilic and thermophilic organisms exhibit poor stability in mild detergents, indicating that instability is inherent to the protein family. Trends in the thermostability of yeast ADP/ATP carrier AAC2 and ovine uncoupling protein UCP1 allow optimal conditions for stability in detergents to be established but also provide mechanistic insights into the interactions of lipids, substrates, and inhibitors with these proteins. Both proteins exhibit similar stability profiles across various detergents, where stability increases with the size of the associated detergent micelle. Detailed analysis shows that lipids stabilize carriers indirectly by increasing the associated detergent micelle size, but cardiolipin stabilizes by direct interactions as well. Cardiolipin reverses destabilizing effects of ADP and bongkrekic acid on AAC2 and enhances large stabilizing effects of carboxyatractyloside, revealing that this lipid interacts in the m-state and possibly other states of the transport cycle, despite being in a dynamic interface. Fatty acid activators destabilize UCP1 in a similar way, which can also be prevented by cardiolipin, indicating that they interact like transport substrates. Our controls show that carriers can be soluble but unfolded in some commonly used detergents, such as the zwitterionic Fos-choline-12, which emphasizes the need for simple validation assays like the one used here."

Nevertheless, no direct evidence has been reported on the transcriptional regulation of the daptomycin gene cluster expression, which might hinder targeted genetic engineering based on the rational designing of the transcriptional circuit to improve daptomycin production. Secondary metabolism development including antibiotic production in Streptomyces is transcriptionally regulated by extracellular stimuli, intracellular signaling pathways, and their cross-talks (9.Liu G.

AdpA is one of the key pleiotropic transcriptional regulators in Streptomyces griseus, and is widely found in Streptomyces to control morphological development and secondary metabolism (10.Pan Y.

Once activated, AdpA binds to the highly conserved binding elements (5′-TGGCSNGWWY-3′) on the promoters of its regulons, which are involved in various cell developmental programs (11.Ohnishi Y.

In the daptomycin industrial producer S. roseosporus SW0702, we have characterized the DeoR-type regulator DptR2 as required for daptomycin production but not for gene cluster expression (17.Wang F. Ren N.N. Luo S. Chen X.X. Mao X.M. Li Y.Q. DptR2, a DeoR-type auto-regulator, is required for daptomycin production in Streptomyces roseosporus.Gene. 2014; 544: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To further reveal the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of daptomycin production, we applied affinity purification with biotinylated dptEp as a probe to isolate a TetR-type transcriptional regulator, AtrA. In Streptomyces coelicolor, AtrA binds to the coding regions of actII-orf4 and actII-orf3 to positively regulate actinorhodin production, but it is not required for undecylprodigiosin or calcium-dependent antibiotic production or for morphological development (18.Uguru G.C. Stephens K.E. Stead J.A. Towle J.E. Baumberg S. McDowall K.J. Transcriptional activation of the pathway-specific regulator of the actinorhodin biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces coelicolor.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 131-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In S. griseus, AtrA binds to the strR promoter synergistically along with AdpA to conditionally regulate streptomycin production (19.Hirano S. Tanaka K. Ohnishi Y. Horinouchi S. Conditionally positive effect of the TetR-family transcriptional regulator AtrA on streptomycin production by Streptomyces griseus.Microbiology. 2008; 154: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, AveI, the homolog of AtrA in Streptomyces avermitilis, negatively regulates avermectin biosynthesis and does not bind to the aveR promoter (20.Chen L. Lu Y. Chen J. Zhang W. Shu D. Qin Z. Yang S. Jiang W. Characterization of a negative regulator AveI for avermectin biosynthesis in Streptomyces avermitilis NRRL8165.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 80: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we have provided evidence that AtrA could positively regulate daptomycin production by directly binding to the gene cluster promoter; atrA was one of AdpA transcriptional targets to mediate the conserved A-factor signaling pathway. We also have suggested the positive feedback regulation of atrA expression for the proper production of daptomycin. This is the first report to provide direct evidence at the transcriptional regulatory level for daptomycin production and also suggests that an AtrA-mediated A-factor signaling pathway is required for daptomycin production. S. roseosporus SW0702 is an industrial daptomycin producer (17.Wang F. Ren N.N. Luo S. Chen X.X. Mao X.M. Li Y.Q. DptR2, a DeoR-type auto-regulator, is required for daptomycin production in Streptomyces roseosporus.Gene. 2014; 544: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ΔatrA, ΔadpA, and ΔarpA mutants are the in-frame deletion strains of S. roseosporus SW0702. Escherichia coli strain TG1 was the host for routine plasmid subcloning. BL21(DE3) was used for protein expression and ET12456/pUZ8002 for conjugation of plasmids into Streptomyces. E. coli cells were cultured in LB medium for plasmid preparation and protein expression. Solid R5 medium was used for morphological development and sporulation of Streptomyces cells, and MSF medium was used for conjugation (21.Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Butter M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000: 125-160Google Scholar). For daptomycin production, tryptic soy broth plus 5% PEG 6000 was the seed medium, and YEME (0.3% yeast extract, 0.3% malt extract, 0.5% tryptone, 4% glucose) medium was used for fermentation (17.Wang F. Ren N.N. Luo S. Chen X.X. Mao X.M. Li Y.Q. DptR2, a DeoR-type auto-regulator, is required for daptomycin production in Streptomyces roseosporus.Gene. 2014; 544: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Plasmids and primers were listed in TABLE 1, TABLE 2, respectively. Primer pairs 1 + 2 and 3 + 4 were used to amplify the right and left homologous regions of atrA, respectively, and cloned into the HindIII/BamHI and BamHI/EcoRI sites of pKC1139 (22.Bierman M. Logan R. O'Brien K. Seno E.T. Rao R.N. Schoner B.E. Plasmid cloning vectors for the conjugal transfer of DNA from Escherichia coli to Streptomyces spp.Gene. 1992; 116: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar), respectively, to give rise to pKC1139-atrA. Plasmids pKC1139-adpA and pKC1139-arpA were constructed by cloning homologous fragments into the HindIII/BamHI and BamHI/EcoRI sites of pKC1139. Primers 5 + 6 and 7 + 8 were for adpA, and primers 9 + 10 and 11 + 12 were for arpA. The complementation DNA fragments for atrA, adpA, and arpA were amplified with primer pairs 13 + 14, 15 + 16, and 17 + 18, respectively, and cloned into the HindIII/BamHI site of pSET152 (22.Bierman M.

Both promoters were digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of pIPP1 (23.Jones G.H. Integrative, xylE-based promoter probe vectors for use in Streptomyces.Plasmid. 2011; 65: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) to get pIPP1-dptEp and pIPP1-atrAp, respectively. BamHI-digested dptEp was ligated into the BamHI site of pUC18 to generate pUC18-dptEp. atrA and adpA were amplified with primer pairs 24 + 25 and 26 + 27 and cloned into the BamHI/HindIII site of pET32a to obtain the expression plasmids pET32a-atrA and pET32a-adpA, respectively.

DptR2, a DeoR-type auto-regulator, is required for daptomycin production in Streptomyces roseosporus.Gene. 2014; 544: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). pKC1139-based knock-out plasmids were introduced into S. roseosporus SW0702 by conjugation. The conjugates were streaked on the solid R5 medium with apramycin at 37 °C to get the single crossover strains. They were patched on the R5 medium at 37 °C for two rounds of sporulation. Spores were then diluted on the R5 medium into single colonies. The mutants were identified from the apramycin-sensitive clones by PCR and Southern blot (data not shown). The biotinylated vector and vector-dptEp were prepared by PCR from pUC18 and pUC18-dptEp, respectively, with universal primers 28 + 29 and gel-purified. About 500 ng of biotinylated DNA was incubated with streptavidin-agarose (Prozyme) and washed twice with the binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) to eliminate the unbound probes and save the pellet. S. roseosporus SW0702 cells were cultured in tryptic soy broth medium to the logarithmic phase, collected, sonicated in the binding buffer, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min to collect the total lysate. The proteome was incubated initially with vector-streptavidin-agarose at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of 500 μg of sheared sperm DNA to prevent the nonspecific binding of proteins. The mixture was centrifuged briefly, and the supernatant was incubated with dptEp-streptavidin-agarose. After binding at room temperature for 60 min, the beads were spun down and washed with the binding buffer three times, and the binding proteins were eluted with high ionic buffer (binding buffer plus 1 m NaCl). The eluted protein was buffer-exchanged with 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0 on a 10-kDa cut-off YM-10 column (Millipore). Then it was incubated with 10 mm DTT at 56 °C for 30 min and cooled down to room temperature followed by incubation with 20 mm iodoacetamide in the dark for 30 min. The protein mixture was digested with 100 ng of trypsin at 37 °C overnight, vacuum-dried, and subjected to LC/MS/MS to identify the peptide sequences. BL21(DE3) containing expression plasmids for AtrA and AdpA, respectively, was cultured in LB medium at 37 °C to OD = 0.5 and induced with 0.1 mm IPTG at 16 °C for 16 h. Cells were collected and disrupted in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) by sonication. Proteins expressed in soluble form were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen) and eluted in buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole. Proteins were ultra-filtered on a 10-kDa cut-off YM-3 column (Millipore) with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. 5′-Biotin-labeled DNA probes including vector, vector-dptEp, and vector-atrAp were prepared by high fidelity PCR from plasmids pTA2, pTA2-dptEp, and pTA2-atrAp, respectively, with universal primers 28 + 29. These probes were gel-purified and eluted in sterile water. EMSA was demonstrated as described previously with 1 ng of probes and an increasing amount of protein (24.Mao X.M. Sun Z.H. Liang B.R. Wang Z.B. Feng W.H. Huang F.L. Li Y.Q. Positive feedback regulation of stgR expression for secondary metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 2072-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The DNase I footprinting assays were demonstrated as described previously (24.Mao X.M. Sun Z.H. Liang B.R. Wang Z.B. Feng W.H. Huang F.L. Li Y.Q. Positive feedback regulation of stgR expression for secondary metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 2072-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 5′-FAM-labeled dptEp and atrAp were prepared by PCR from plasmids pTA2-dptEp and pTA2-atrAp, respectively, with universal primers 29 + 23 and then gel-purified. About 50 ng of probes were incubated with various amounts of protein, and 0.01 unit of DNase I was added for partial digestion. Daptomycin was produced in S. roseosporus as described previously (17.Wang F. Ren N.N. Luo S. Chen X.X. Mao X.M. Li Y.Q. DptR2, a DeoR-type auto-regulator, is required for daptomycin production in Streptomyces roseosporus.Gene. 2014; 544: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After fermentation, the culture was mixed with an equal volume of methanol and centrifuged. The supernatant was analyzed by HPLC on a reverse phase column (Phenomenex, 250 × 4.6 mm, C18) with UV detection at 366 nm at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. The solutions used were solution A (50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 3.15 ± 0.05) and solution B (100% acetonitrile). HPLC was run using the following procedure: 0–10 min, A:B = 20:50%; 10–40 min, A:B = 50:80%; 40–50 min, A:B = 80:95%. Pure daptomycin was used as a standard. The catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity assays were demonstrated as described previously with minor modifications (25.Ingram C. Brawner M. Youngman P. Westpheling J. xylE functions as an efficient reporter gene in Streptomyces spp: use for the study of galP1, a catabolite-controlled promoter.J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Streptomyces cells were harvested, washed with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and resuspended in 1 ml of sample buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10% acetone). Cells were lysed by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. The assay buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm catechol) was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 min, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μl of cell extract to 900 μl of assay buffer. The optical density at 375 nm was measured over time (0, 1, 2, and 3 min, respectively). Catechol dioxygenase activity was calculated as the change rate in the optical density at 375 nm and converted to milliunits/min/mg of total protein. Two pathway-specific regulators, DptR1 and DptR2, were found when the daptomycin gene cluster was initially sequenced in S. roseosporus NRRL 11379 (3.Miao V. Coëffet-Legal M.F. Brian P. Brost R. Penn J. Whiting A. Martin S. Ford R. Parr I. Bouchard M. Silva C.J. Wrigley S.K. Baltz R.H. Daptomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces roseosporus: cloning and analysis of the gene cluster and revision of peptide stereochemistry.Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1507-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We have reported that the industrial daptomycin producer S. roseosporus SW0702 contains the daptomycin gene cluster in high identity with that from S. roseosporus NRRL 11379 (17.Wang F. Ren N.N. Luo S. Chen X.X. Mao X.M. Li Y.Q. DptR2, a DeoR-type auto-regulator, is required for daptomycin production in Streptomyces roseosporus.Gene. 2014; 544: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The whole gene cluster was reported to be transcribed as a large mRNA from the promoter of dptE (dptEp) (3.Miao V. Coëffet-Legal M.F. Brian P. Brost R. Penn J. Whiting A. Martin S. Ford R. Parr I. Bouchard M. Silva C.J. Wrigley S.K. Baltz R.H. Daptomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces roseosporus: cloning and analysis of the gene cluster and revision of peptide stereochemistry.Microbiology. 2005; 151: 1507-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To further reveal its transcriptional regulatory mechanism, we used the biotinylated dptEp DNA fragment as a probe to isolate regulators that might interact with dptEp directly from the total lysate of mycelia (Fig. 1B). In total, 82 proteins were identified by LC/MS/MS, including the transcription machinery (RNA polymerase and accessary proteins), several transcriptional regulators with DNA-binding domains, and other proteins that might interact with these DNA-binding proteins (data not shown). Among these identified regulators, AtrA is a TetR-type transcriptional regulator with a DNA-binding domain at its N terminus, and protein alignment showed that it had 86, 70, and 67% identity with its homologs from S. griseus, S. avermitilis, and S. coelicolor, respectively, with 100% identity in the DNA-binding domains (data not shown). AtrA was expressed and purified from E. coli. EMSA showed that AtrA specifically bound to dptEp (Fig. 2A), which confirmed our screening strategy. Four AtrA-binding sites on dptEp were determined by DNase I footprinting assays (Fig. 2B). The site closest to the start codon (ATG) of dptE (Fig. 2B, site a) had the same binding pattern, despite the concentration of AtrA, suggesting that a small amount of AtrA could fully occupy this site. On other sites, however, the protection patterns became more significant with the increased amount of AtrA. Farther away from dptE ATG, more AtrA was needed to completely protect these sites (Fig. 2B, site b to d), suggesting gradient binding affinity with AtrA along with dptEp. Moreover, deletion of all four sites on dptEp could abrogate binding of AtrA on dptEp, but removal of each of the binding sites could not apparently alter the binding affinity of AtrA to dptEp (data not shown), further supporting multiple interactive sites on dptEp for AtrA. After alignment with the DNA sequencing data (Fig. 2, C–E), the binding sequence of these sites was determined (Fig. 2F). However, the four AtrA-binding sites had no consensus or apparent palindrome sequence, which is often recognized by TetR-type regulators (26.Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). S. coelicolor AtrA has been shown to bind to the coding region of actII-orf4, and these sites do not show significant conserved sequences but have imperfect inverted repeats of the hexanucleotide GGAAT(G/C) sequence (18.Uguru G.C. Stephens K.E. Stead J.A. Towle J.E. Baumberg S. McDowall K.J. Transcriptional activation of the pathway-specific regulator of the actinorhodin biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces coelicolor.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 131-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Also an imperfect inverted repeat (GGAGGGNNNCGTTCC) was identified in S. griseus, and mutation of this repeat abolishes S. griseus AtrA binding to strRp (19.Hirano S. Tanaka K. Ohnishi Y. Horinouchi S. Conditionally positive effect of the TetR-family transcriptional regulator AtrA on streptomycin production by Streptomyces griseus.Microbiology. 2008; 154: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consistent with the 100% identity of the AtrA DNA-binding domain from three Streptomyces species, we found two GGAG motifs on site a, a GGAC motif on site b, and a GGAA motif on sites c and d, respectively. However, no apparent inverted repeat was observed on any of the sites. Nevertheless, our results suggested that AtrA is a transcriptional regulator that binds directly to the promoter of the daptomycin gene cluster. The xylE reporter assays were used to investigate the effects of AtrA on dptEp activity. atrA was knocked out by in-frame deletion. S. roseosporus had the highest daptomycin productivity, between 3 and 4 days, and subsequently decreased (17.Wang F. Ren N.N. Luo S. Chen X.X. Mao X.M. Li Y.Q. DptR2, a DeoR-type auto-regulator, is required for daptomycin production in Streptomyces roseosporus.Gene. 2014; 544: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the highest dptEp activity was observed at day 2 and then dropped continuously during daptomycin production. But the ΔatrA mutant showed null dioxygenase activities on all the days examined (Fig. 3A). Consistent with these results, HPLC assays showed that the ΔatrA mutant did not produce daptomycin, whereas reintroduction of atrA rescued daptomycin production (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that AtrA can bind directly to the daptomycin gene cluster promoter to positively regulate daptomycin production. The ΔatrA mutant in S. coelicolor does not show a significant difference in morphological development from the wild type (18.Uguru G.C. Stephens K.E. Stead J.A. Towle J.E. Baumberg S. McDowall K.J.

However, the phenotype of the ΔatrA mutant in S. roseosporus was quite different from the wild type in that this mutant grew only in substrate mycelia on the R5 medium, whereas the wild type and the complementation strain underwent morphological development with aerial mycelia (Fig. 4A) and spores (data not shown). This phenotype was reminiscent of the ΔadpA mutant, which also shows the bald phenotype from many Streptomyces species, including S. coelicolor, S. griseus, etc. (11.Ohnishi Y. Yamazaki H. Kato J.Y. Tomono A. Horinouchi S. AdpA, a central transcriptional regulator in the A-factor regulatory cascade that leads to morphological development and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces griseus.Biosci.

The level of AdpA directly affects expression of developmental genes in Streptomyces coelicolor.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 6358-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). S. roseosporus AdpA was identified based on a protein BLAST with S. griseus AdpA as a query against the S. roseosporus SW0702 genome sequence. It displayed 97 and 84% identity with its homologs in S. griseus and S. coelicolor, respectively, and the DNA-binding domain also showed 100% identity (data not shown), suggesting that conserved functions of AdpA in S. roseosporus. adpA was disrupted by in-frame deletion. The ΔadpA mutant constantly grew in substrate mycelia, as expected (Fig. 4B), and did not produce daptomycin (Fig. 4C). Moreover, after 3 days on the R5 medium, red pigment production was observed in wild type and complementation strains but not in the ΔatrA or ΔadpA mutant (data not shown). These results suggested that both AtrA and AdpA are positive regulators of secondary metabolism (especially daptomycin production) and morphological development. AdpA is a pleiotropic regulator that binds to the promoters of a variety of regulons with a consensus motif TGGCSNGWWY (S, G, or C; W, A, or T; Y, T, or C; N, any nucleotide) (15.Higo A. Hara H. Horinouchi S. Ohnishi Y.

Three potential binding motifs were identified on the atrA promoter (atrAp) of S. roseosporus (Fig. 5A), although one or two mismatches were still found (Fig. 5B). However, these motifs, even with two or three mismatches, can still be recognized by AdpA, as exemplified by the wblA promoter in S. coelicolor (13.Lee H.N. Kim J.S. Kim P. Lee H.S. Kim E.S. Repression of antibiotic downregulator WblA by AdpA in Streptomyces coelicolor.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2013; 79: 4159-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), suggesting that atrA might also be one of the AdpA targets in S. roseosporus. AdpA was expressed and purified from E. coli. Consistent with the in silico prediction, EMSA showed that AdpA could specifically bind to atrAp, and three shifted bands were observed (Fig. 5C). Moreover, xylE reporter assays indicated that atrAp activities decreased during daptomycin production in wild type (Fig. 5D), which was coincident with dptEp activities. Deletion of adpA caused a 2–4-fold decrease in atrAp activities (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that AdpA is required for daptomycin production and morphological development by directly regulating atrA expression. The two positive regulators AtrA and AdpA in S. roseosporus showed the highest homology to their counterparts in S. griseus (data not shown), where A-factor-triggered morphological development and secondary metabolism have been extensively studied. The A-factor binds to its receptor protein, ArpA, and releases it from the adpA promoter (adpAp), thus derepressing adpA expression to switch on the developmental programs (11.Ohnishi Y. Yamazaki H. Kato J.Y. Tomono A. Horinouchi S. AdpA, a central transcriptional regulator in the A-factor regulatory cascade that leads to morphological development and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces griseus.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). S. roseosporus ArpA was also identified from the genome sequence by a protein BLAST with S. griseus ArpA. It showed 95% identity with its counterpart in S. griseus and 100% identity in the DNA-binding domain (data not shown). Meanwhile, the binding sequence on adpAp also showed 100% identity in S. roseosporus and S. griseus (data not shown), suggesting that ArpA in S. roseosporus must function via the same mechanism as in S. griseus. This prompted us to construct a strain for a high yield of daptomycin, because deletion of arpA in S. griseus can enhance streptomycin production and accelerate morphological development (27.Onaka H. Ando N. Nihira T. Yamada Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. Cloning and characterization of the A-factor receptor gene from Streptomyces griseus.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6083-6092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). arpA was also deleted in S. roseosporus by in-frame knock-out. Consistent with this hypothesis, the ΔarpA mutant showed earlier development of aerial mycelia compared with the wild type (Fig. 6A) and about 2.5-fold higher production of daptomycin (Fig. 6B). These data suggested that an A-factor-motivated signaling pathway is conserved in S. roseosporus and that removal of the A-factor receptor can promote daptomycin production and morphological development. AtrA was predicted to be a TetR-type transcriptional regulator, which often binds to its own promoter (26.Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). EMSA showed that AtrA could bind directly to atrAp at a low concentration (0.2 μm or about 100 ng), but no shifted band was observed even with more AtrA in the control DNA (Fig. 7A), suggesting AtrA could specifically bind to atrAp at high affinity. Meanwhile, five binding sites were determined by DNase I footprinting assays (Fig. 7B), and the sequences were also determined (Fig. 7C). These binding sites were all very small (4, 8, or 10 bp), and no consensus sequence was found (Fig. 7D). Moreover, deletion of all five sites abolished AtrA-atrAp interaction, whereas removal of each site did not affect AtrA binding to atrAp (data not shown), also supporting the idea of multiple interactive sites of AtrA on its own promoter. Nevertheless, we still observed a GGA motif in site a and a GGAA(G/C) motif in sites b and e (Fig. 7D). Although no GGA motif was found in site c or d (Fig. 7D), these sites were rich in purine, suggesting a more complex binding pattern of AtrA on its own promoter. These results, to some extent, were consistent with the previous report that in S. coelicolor, even though AtrA-atrAp interact at high affinity, no AtrA-binding sites could be determined on atrAp by DNase I footprinting assays (28.Ahn S.K. Cuthbertson L. Nodwell J.R. Genome context as a predictive tool for identifying regulatory targets of the TetR family transcriptional regulators.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e50562Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on xylE reporter assays, atrAp activities in the ΔatrA mutant was only about 1/20th that of the wild type on day 2 and persisted at a lower level than wild type in the following days. However, atrAp activities in the wild type also kept dropping (Fig. 7E), suggesting that atrA is positively autoregulated. Here, we used the biotinylated dptEp to isolate AtrA as a positive regulator for daptomycin production by directly binding to the gene cluster promoter. In other Streptomyces species, AtrA can also positively regulate streptomycin and actinorhodin production in S. griseus and S. coelicolor, respectively, by direct binding to strRp and the flanking regions of actII-orf4p, respectively (18.Uguru G.C. Stephens K.E. Stead J.A. Towle J.E. Baumberg S. McDowall K.J. Transcriptional activation of the pathway-specific regulator of the actinorhodin biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces coelicolor.Mol.

Meanwhile, AtrA negatively regulates avermectin production in S. avermitilis without binding to aveRp (20.Chen L. Lu Y. Chen J. Zhang W. Shu D. Qin Z. Yang S. Jiang W. Characterization of a negative regulator AveI for avermectin biosynthesis in Streptomyces avermitilis NRRL8165.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 80: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting diverse and complex regulatory patterns of AtrA in Streptomyces. AtrA was required for morphological development and secondary metabolism in S. roseosporus, suggesting that AtrA is also a pleiotropic regulator as well as AdpA, the key regulator in the A-factor-induced signaling pathway. In S. griseus, AtrA and AdpA synergistically bind to strRp to positively regulate streptomycin production (19.Hirano S. Tanaka K. Ohnishi Y. Horinouchi S. Conditionally positive effect of the TetR-family transcriptional regulator AtrA on streptomycin production by Streptomyces griseus.Microbiology. 2008; 154: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here in S. roseosporus, we demonstrated that AdpA and AtrA bind to different sites of atrAp, as determined by bioinformatics analysis and DNase I footprinting assays, respectively (FIGURE 5., FIGURE 7.). We also proved that atrA expression was under the direct control of AdpA, thus establishing the signaling pathway from extracellular stimulation of the potential A-factor to daptomycin gene cluster expression and also, for the first time, providing direct evidence about the transcriptional regulation of daptomycin production (Fig. 8). Based on these observations, we propose that targeted genetic engineering by deletion of arpA results in enhanced daptomycin production. Although this industrial strain showed the highest daptomycin production at about day 4, gene cluster expression decreased continuously. The decreasing dptEp activity might be explained by the decreased expression of atrA, as AtrA bound directly to atrAp, and positively regulated its activity, thus composing a positive feedback regulatory pattern of atrA expression by itself. We observed that adpA expression also declined during daptomycin production (data not shown), which also might contribute to the decreased expression of atrA, because AdpA positively regulates atrA expression directly. This ingenious regulation of atrA expression might ensure proper gene cluster expression and daptomycin production. AtrA protein from all three Streptomyces species had 100% identity in their DNA-binding domains, suggesting the same binding pattern among the three. Although imperfect inverted repeats were reported in S. coelicolor and S. griseus, no apparent palindromic sequence was observed in S. roseosporus dptEp or atrAp, suggesting the atypical binding pattern of this TetR-type transcriptional regulator. However, most binding sites of AtrA in S. roseosporus contained GGA motifs and were rich in purine. These observations suggested complex binding mechanism of AtrA. Therefore it might not be possible to map precisely the universal conserved binding motifs of AtrA on DNA. However, it might be possible that the adjacent DNA sequence environment or higher DNA architecture conformation is also critical for AtrA recognition and binding. We may need more experimental information, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays or AtrA-DNA co-crystallization, to establish this binding model. We are grateful to Professor George H. Jones, Department of Biology, Emory University, for providing the xylE reporter plasmid pIPP1. We also thank the reviewers for comments made during the revision process that led to an enhanced discussion of the results."
https://openalex.org/W2088858417,"The central dogma of gene expression (DNA to RNA to protein) is universal, but in different domains of life there are fundamental mechanistic differences within this pathway. For example, the canonical molecular signals used to initiate protein synthesis in bacteria and eukaryotes are mutually exclusive. However, the core structures and conformational dynamics of ribosomes that are responsible for the translation steps that take place after initiation are ancient and conserved across the domains of life. We wanted to explore whether an undiscovered RNA-based signal might be able to use these conserved features, bypassing mechanisms specific to each domain of life, and initiate protein synthesis in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Although structured internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNAs can manipulate ribosomes to initiate translation in eukaryotic cells, an analogous RNA structure-based mechanism has not been observed in bacteria. Here we report our discovery that a eukaryotic viral IRES can initiate translation in live bacteria. We solved the crystal structure of this IRES bound to a bacterial ribosome to 3.8 Å resolution, revealing that despite differences between bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes this IRES binds directly to both and occupies the space normally used by transfer RNAs. Initiation in both bacteria and eukaryotes depends on the structure of the IRES RNA, but in bacteria this RNA uses a different mechanism that includes a form of ribosome repositioning after initial recruitment. This IRES RNA bridges billions of years of evolutionary divergence and provides an example of an RNA structure-based translation initiation signal capable of operating in two domains of life."
https://openalex.org/W1966118001,"Annual forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon had in 2012 declined to less than 5,000 sqkm, from over 27,000 in 2004. Mounting empirical evidence suggests that changes in Brazilian law enforcement strategy and the related governance system may account for a large share of the overall success in curbing deforestation rates. At the same time, Brazil is experimenting with alternative approaches to compensate farmers for conservation actions through economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services, at various administrative levels. We develop a spatially explicit simulation model for deforestation decisions in response to policy incentives and disincentives. The model builds on elements of optimal enforcement theory and introduces the notion of imperfect payment contract enforcement in the context of avoided deforestation. We implement the simulations using official deforestation statistics and data collected from field-based forest law enforcement operations in the Amazon region. We show that a large-scale integration of payments with the existing regulatory enforcement strategy involves a tradeoff between the cost-effectiveness of forest conservation and landholder incomes. Introducing payments as a complementary policy measure increases policy implementation cost, reduces income losses for those hit hardest by law enforcement, and can provide additional income to some land users. The magnitude of the tradeoff varies in space, depending on deforestation patterns, conservation opportunity and enforcement costs. Enforcement effectiveness becomes a key determinant of efficiency in the overall policy mix."

We investigated the effects of post-radiation treatment with ascorbic acid on mouse survival. Mice received whole body irradiation (WBI) followed by intraperitoneal administration of ascorbic acid. Administration of 3 g/kg of ascorbic acid immediately after exposure significantly increased mouse survival after WBI at 7 to 8 Gy. However, administration of less than 3 g/kg of ascorbic acid was ineffective, and 4 or more g/kg was harmful to the mice. Post-exposure treatment with 3 g/kg of ascorbic acid reduced radiation-induced apoptosis in bone marrow cells and restored hematopoietic function. Treatment with ascorbic acid (3 g/kg) up to 24 h (1, 6, 12, or 24 h) after WBI at 7.5 Gy effectively improved mouse survival; however, treatments beyond 36 h were ineffective. Two treatments with ascorbic acid (1.5 g/kg × 2, immediately and 24 h after radiation, 3 g/kg in total) also improved mouse survival after WBI at 7.5 Gy, accompanied with suppression of radiation-induced free radical metabolites. In conclusion, administration of high-dose ascorbic acid might reduce radiation lethality in mice even after exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2072669540,"The kinesin-2 family motor KIF3A/B works together with dynein to bidirectionally transport intraflagellar particles, melanosomes, and neuronal vesicles. Compared with kinesin-1, kinesin-2 is less processive, and its processivity is more sensitive to load, suggesting that processivity may be controlled by different gating mechanisms. We used stopped-flow and steady-state kinetics experiments, along with single-molecule and multimotor assays to characterize the entire kinetic cycle of a KIF3A homodimer that exhibits motility similar to that of full-length KIF3A/B. Upon first encounter with a microtubule, the motor rapidly exchanges both mADP and mATP. When adenosine 5′-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate was used to entrap the motor in a two-head-bound state, exchange kinetics were unchanged, indicating that rearward strain in the two-head-bound state does not alter nucleotide binding to the front head. A similar lack of front head gating was found when intramolecular strain was enhanced by shortening the neck linker domain from 17 to 14 residues. In single-molecule assays in ADP, the motor dissociates at 2.1 s−1, 20-fold slower than the stepping rate, demonstrating the presence of rear head gating. In microtubule pelleting assays, the KDMt is similar in ADP and ATP. The data and accompanying simulations suggest that, rather than KIF3A processivity resulting from strain-dependent regulation of nucleotide binding (front head gating), the motor spends a significant fraction of its hydrolysis cycle in a low affinity state but dissociates only slowly from this state. This work provides a mechanism to explain differences in the load-dependent properties of kinesin-1 and kinesin-2."

https://openalex.org/W2009443452,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are post-translational modifiers that deacetylate proteins. Despite their crucial role in numerous biological processes, the use of broad-range HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), has shown clinical efficacy. However, undesired side effects highlight the necessity to better understand the biology of different HDACs and target the relevant HDACs. Using a novel mouse model, in which HDAC1 and HDAC2 can be simultaneously deleted in the intestine of adult mice, we show that the simultaneous deletion of HDAC1 and HDAC2 leads to a rapid loss of intestinal homeostasis. Importantly, this deletion cannot be sustained, and 8 days after initial ablation, stem cells that have escaped HDAC1 or HDAC2 deletion swiftly repopulate the intestinal lining. In vitro ablation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 using intestinal organoid cultures resulted in a down-regulation of multiple intestinal stem cell markers and functional loss of clonogenic capacity. Importantly, treatment of wild-type organoids with class I-specific HDACi MS-275 also induced a similar loss of stemness, providing a possible rationale for the gastrointestinal side effects often observed in HDACi-treated patients. In conclusion, these data show that HDAC1 and HDAC2 have a redundant function and are essential to maintain intestinal homeostasis.—Zimberlin, C. D., Lancini, C., Sno, R., Rosekrans, S.

Here we demonstrate that this adaptive increase in System A function is restrained in cells subjected to prior incubation with linoleic acid (LOA, an unsaturated C18:2 fatty acid) for 24 h. While fatty acid treatment had no detectable effect upon stress-induced SNAT2 or ATF4 gene transcription, the associated increase in SNAT2 protein/membrane transport activity were strongly suppressed in L6 myotubes or HeLa cells preincubated with LOA.

SNAT1, -2, and -4 form members of the “System A” subgroup of the SLC38 family of amino acid transporters that mediate the cellular uptake of short chain neutral amino acids some of which have key roles in intermediary metabolism (e.g. alanine and glutamine) whereas others are nutritionally indispensable for cell function (e.g. methionine and threonine). Of the three System A transporters, SNAT2 (SLC38A2) is the most widely expressed but a defining feature of all members of this subgroup is their ability to mediate uptake of N-methylated amino acid substrates, such as 2-methylaminoisobutyric acid (Me-AIB), 2The abbreviations used are: Me-AIB2-methylaminoisobutyric acidLOAlinoleic acidmTORCmammalian target of rapamycin complexUPSubiquitin proteasome system. which has proved invaluable in their functional characterization (1.Mackenzie B.

Amino acid uptake via all SLC38 transporters is coupled to the inward movement of sodium down its electrochemical gradient, which helps develop an outwardly-directed concentration gradient for System A substrates that can be utilized to drive the exchange uptake of a range of essential amino acids (e.g. leucine) through transporters (such as System L) that function in parallel with SLC38 in the plasma membrane (2.Baird F.E.

It should be noted that expression of other amino acid carriers and membrane transporters (e.g. System ASC, the Na,K-ATPase and the GLUT4 glucose transporter), are not likewise affected suggesting that the adaptive increase in SNAT2 forms part of a coordinated cell response to nutrient stress. Indeed, the transcriptional up-regulation of SNAT2 in response to amino acid withdrawal relies upon a tripartite amino acid response element in the first intron of the SLC38A2 gene (10.Palii S.S. Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S.

J. 2006; 395: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Precisely how an increase in SNAT2 transcription is triggered by amino acid deficiency remains unclear, although genetic interventions and use of pharmacological inhibitors have implicated the GCN2/ATF4 pathway (7.Kilberg M.S.

Nutr. 2005; 25: 59-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and members of the MAP kinase family (ERK and JNK), the latter through nutrient signaling loci that remain unidentified (11.Franchi-Gazzola R. Visigalli R. Bussolati O. Dall'Asta V. Gazzola G.C. Adaptive increase of amino acid transport system A requires ERK1/2 activation.J. Biol.

The osmoregulatory and the amino acid-regulated responses of system A are mediated by different signal transduction pathways.J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). While increased SNAT2 transcription contributes to the overall increase in SNAT2 abundance, we have previously shown that the SNAT2 adaptive response also includes a non-genomic component involving enhanced stabilization of the SNAT2 protein (13.Hyde R. Cwiklinski E.L. MacAulay K. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Distinct sensor pathways in the hierarchical control of SNAT2, a putative amino acid transceptor, by amino acid availability.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19788-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is thought that under amino acid deficient conditions SNAT2 may adopt a structurally more stable configuration, whereas SNAT2 occupancy by any one single amino acid substrate is sensed as reflecting a state of amino acid sufficiency and one that signals a reduction in SNAT2 transcription and associated destabilization/loss of SNAT2 protein (13.Hyde R. Cwiklinski E.L. MacAulay K. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Distinct sensor pathways in the hierarchical control of SNAT2, a putative amino acid transceptor, by amino acid availability.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19788-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consequently, SNAT2 is thought to function as an amino acid sensor or “transceptor” with the capacity to signal to nutrient responsive pathways that impact upon gene expression and protein turnover. Although numerous studies have explored the processes by which SNAT2 is up-regulated in response to amino acid deprivation, our knowledge of the mechanisms that induce SNAT2 degradation by contrast remain poorly investigated. One potential process that may serve as an important determinant of SNAT2 turnover is the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) given that Nedd4.2, a ubiquitin E3-ligase, has previously been implicated in the polyubiquitination and degradation of SNAT2 (14.Hatanaka T. Hatanaka Y. Setou M. Regulation of amino acid transporter ATA2 by ubiquitin ligase Nedd4–2.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35922-35930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To our knowledge no information currently exists of how SNAT2 processing via the UPS may be stimulated but, given that fatty acid-derived lipids such as ceramide promote a reduction in cell surface SNAT2 with a concomitant loss in membrane transport activity (15.Hyde R. Hajduch E. Powell D.J. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Ceramide down-regulates System A amino acid transport and protein synthesis in rat skeletal muscle cells.FASEB J. 2005; 19: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is plausible that SNAT2 processing via the UPS may be subject to regulation by fatty acid availability. Indeed, evidence showing that fatty acids (e.g. oleic and linoleic acid) can stimulate proteolytic activity in muscle (16.Dahlmann B. Rutschmann M. Kuehn L. Reinauer H. Activation of the multicatalytic proteinase from rat skeletal muscle by fatty acids or sodium dodecyl sulphate.Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and promote proteasomal degradation of both membrane (e.g. CD36 (17.Smith J. Su X. El-Maghrabi R. Stahl P.D. Abumrad N.A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 13578-13585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), tyrosinase (18.Ando H. Watabe H. Valencia J.C. Yasumoto K. Furumura M. Funasaka Y. Oka M. Ichihashi M. Hearing V.J. Fatty acids regulate pigmentation via proteasomal degradation of tyrosinase: a new aspect of ubiquitin-proteasome function.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15427-15433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)) and cytosolic proteins (e.g. fatty acid synthase (19.Wójcik C. Lohe K. Kuang C. Xiao Y. Jouni Z. Poels E. Modulation of adipocyte differentiation by omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids involves the ubiquitin-proteasome system.J. Cell Mol. Med. 2014; 18: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)) provide strong support for this hypothesis. In this study we demonstrate that, while amino acid deprivation and hypertonicity induce a robust increase in cellular SNAT2 expression and function, the adaptive increase in SNAT2 can be significantly suppressed by pretreatment of cells with linoleic acid; a polyunsaturated (C18:2) ω-6 fatty acid. This fatty acid-induced suppression in SNAT2 adaptation cannot be attributed to reduced transcription of the SLC38A2 gene but rather is a consequence of enhanced SNAT2 loss via the UPS given that the fatty acid-induced loss in SNAT2 can be attenuated by MG132, a potent cell permeable proteasomal inhibitor. α-MEM (α-minimal essential medium), DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), EBSS (Earle's Balanced Salt Solution), Opti-Mem, FBS (fetal bovine serum), and antibiotic/antimycotic solution were from Life Technologies.

All primers were synthesized by the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Service (University of Dundee). X-ray film was purchased from Konica Minolta (Tokyo, Japan). shRNA sequences were inserted into the pLKO.1-puro lentiviral vector (Sigma) as follows. Each hairpin consisted of a 21-nucleotide sense sequence, a short hairpin sequence (CTCGAG), a 21-nucleotide antisense sequence and five thymidines (a stop signal for RNA polymerase). Oligonucleotides were constructed for human Nedd4.2 (sense and antisense strands underlined, hairpin loop is indicated by italics): shRNA 1 forward CGGAACAATCGAACCACAACTTGGCTCGAGCCAAGTTGTGGTTCGATTGTTTTTTTG; shRNA 1 reverse AATTCAAAAAAACAATCGAACCACAACTTGGCTCGAGCCAAGTTGTGGTTCGATTGTT. Additional nucleotides were added to the ends of the oligos as shown such that annealing of the two complementary oligos resulted in overhangs consistent with those generated by EcoRI and AgeI. Oligos were annealed by mixing 2 μg of each oligo, heating to 94 °C for 10 min followed by cooling at a rate of 1 °C per min until 21 °C was reached. The final double-stranded DNA sequences were then inserted into pLKO.1-puro at the EcoRI and AgeI sites. Correct insertions of shRNA were confirmed by sequencing. Recombinant lentiviruses were produced by co-transfecting HEK 293T cells with the empty pLKO.1-puro vector, pLKO.1-puro/scramble, or pLKO.1-puro/Nedd4.2 plasmids with the envelope vector pCMV VSVg and the packaging vector pHR CMV8.2 ΔR at ratios of 3:2:2, respectively according to mass. Infectious lentiviral particles were harvested by collecting the cell culture medium 72 h later and filtered through 0.45-μm Minisart cellulose-acetate filters. Infection of HeLa cells was carried out by adding 1 ml crude lentivirus preparation to HeLa cells seeded in 6-cm dishes in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. Medium was replaced with standard growth medium containing 3 μg/ml puromycin 24 h post-transduction, and cells were maintained in this selective medium until fully selected. L6 skeletal muscle cells were cultured to the stage of myotubes as described previously (20.Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S.

HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with pCDNA6-SNAT2-V5 (13.Hyde R. Cwiklinski E.L. MacAulay K. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S.

The 7A-SNAT2-V5 sequence was synthesized by Life Technologies Geneart and the synthesized DNA was cloned into pcDNA6-V5 plasmid via XhoI/XbaI digestion. For isolation of total membranes, cells were grown in 15 cm dishes and treated as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and harvested from culture dishes using a scraper. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min and the resultant pellet resuspended in 3 ml of ice cold buffer I (250 mmol/liter sucrose, 20 mmol/liter HEPES, 5 mmol/liter NaN3, 2 mmol/liter EGTA, 100 μmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmol/liter trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucyl amido [4-guanidino] butane, 1 μmol/liter pepstatin-A, and 1 μmol/liter leupeptin; pH 7.4) and homogenized. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 177,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet, containing the total membranes, was resuspendend in 50 μl of Buffer I supplemented with protease inhibitor and stored at −20 °C. In some experiments, total membranes were deglycosylated using PNGase F enzyme according to manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Proteins from whole cell lysates (30 μg) or total membranes (10 μg) were separated on polyacrylamide resolving gels by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane by immunoblotting as described previously (20.Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Constitutive activation of Protein Kinase Bα (PKBα) by membrane targeting promotes glucose and System A amino acid transport, protein synthesis and GSK3 inactivation in L6 muscle cells.Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and blocked with 5% (w/v) milk in 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies (as indicated in figure legends), and then with an appropriate peroxidase-conjugated IgG for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence on Konica Minolta X-Ray film. Quantification of immunoblots was performed using Image J software. Plasma membrane proteins were isolated using the Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (Thermo Scientific) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, four 10-cm dishes of confluent HeLa cells were treated as described in the figure legend. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin solution (10 ml per dish) for 30 min at 4 °C. After the biotinylation reaction was quenched using 500 μl of quenching solution/dish, cells were scraped, pooled, and washed with 1× TBS. For lysis, cells were suspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer and sonicated. The clarified supernatant was then applied to a NeutrAvidin-agarose column, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed with wash buffer. Biotinylated membrane proteins were eluted by 400 μl of SDS-PAGE with 50 mm DTT and subject to SDS-PAGE and immunblotting with antibodies against SNAT2 and the Na,K-ATPase (a plasma membrane marker). Total RNA was extracted from L6 myotubes using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), SYBR Green JumpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich), and primers targeting Actin and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) as a control. The sequences for these primers are as follows: Slc38a2: rat forward, 5′-GCAGCCGGAGAAGGATGATGAAC-3′, reverse, 5′-GAAGAGGGCGGCAAGCAAATACA-3′, Slc38a2: human forward, 5′-GTGTTAATGGCTGTGACCCTGAC-3′, Slc38a2: human reverse, 5′- GAGACTATGACGCCACCAACTGA-3′, ATF4: rat forward, 5′-ACCCAAACCTTATGACCCACCTG-3′, ATF4: rat reverse, 5′-GCTGCTGTCTTGTTTTGCTCCATC-3′, Nedd4.2: rat forward, 5′-TCTGCCACGGACAACTACAC- 3′, Nedd4.2: rat reverse, 5′- CACAGGCCTGAGTTGGGATT-3′, Nedd4.2: human forward, 5′-CTTAGTCATCCAGTGGAGATTTGTG- 3′, Nedd4.2: human reverse, 5′-AGCAACTCCAGCTCATTTTCATC- 3′, Actin: rat forward, 5′-CCGACAGGATGCAGAAGAAG-3′, Actin: rat reverse, 5′-ATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGTC-3′, GAPDH: forward, 5′-TGGAAAGCTGTGGCGTGAT-3′, and GAPDH: reverse 5′-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTGAT-3′. PCR amplification was performed with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 15 s, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min. The ratio of the different genes mRNA expression to GAPDH mRNA expression was calculated as described previously (38.Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25408) Google Scholar). After experimental treatments, L6/HeLa were incubated with 10 μmol/liter [14C]Me-AIB (1 μCi/ml) for 10 min to assess the uptake of Me-AIB as previously described (20.Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Constitutive activation of Protein Kinase Bα (PKBα) by membrane targeting promotes glucose and System A amino acid transport, protein synthesis and GSK3 inactivation in L6 muscle cells.Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Nonspecific tracer binding was quantified by determining cell-associated radioactivity in the presence of a saturating dose of unlabeled Me-AIB (10 mm). To terminate uptake activity, cells were washed three times with isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl, w/v) and then lysed in 50 mm NaOH. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting and standardized to protein concentration determined using the Bradford method (21.Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar). For multiple comparisons, statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA. For individual comparisons, statistical analysis was performed using a Student’s t test. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software and considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. To assess whether System A adaptation to extracellular amino acid limitation would be sensitive to fatty acid availability, we initially monitored the effect of linoleic acid (LOA; a polyunsaturated (C18:2) ω-6 fatty acid) upon System A transport activity using Me-AIB, a paradigm non-metabolisable System A substrate. Fig. 1, A and B show that a 4 h amino acid deprivation period induces more than a 6-fold increase in System A transport in L6 myotubes compared with cells held in amino acid-containing medium. Strikingly, this adaptive increase in System A transport was reduced when myotubes were preincubated with LOA in time and dose-dependent manner: the suppressive effect of the fatty acid being maximal when myotubes were treated with LOA for 24 h at a dose of 300 μm. The ability to suppress the System A adaptive response in L6 myotubes was not confined to LOA as, in separate experiments, palmitoleic acid (C16:1), oleic acid (C18:1), or docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) also induced a similar inhibitory response (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the observed suppressive effect of LOA on System A was not restricted to L6 myotubes. Fig. 1D shows that HeLa cells (an immortalized human adenocarcinoma cell line) also display a significant (9-fold) increase in System A adaptation upon being subjected to amino acid withdrawal, but that this is strongly suppressed when cells were pretreated with LOA. Our previous studies have indicated that the adaptive response is principally attributed to changes in cellular SNAT2 abundance (9.Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Subcellular localization and adaptive up-regulation of the System A (SAT2) amino acid transporter in skeletal-muscle cells and adipocytes.Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In line with this proposition, Fig. 2A shows that there is a robust increase in SNAT2 protein abundance in total membranes prepared from both L6 myotubes and HeLa cells following a 4 h amino acid deprivation period. It is noteworthy that under amino acid restricted conditions, antibodies to SNAT2 detect two distinct but broad protein bands of ∼60 kDa and ∼40 kDa, respectively, in L6 myotubes. We have previously reported that the 60 kDa band represents the mature cell surface glycosylated transporter (22.Hyde R. Peyrollier K. Hundal H.S. Insulin promotes the cell surface recruitment of the SAT2/ATA2 System A amino acid transporter from an endosomal compartment in skeletal muscle cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13628-13634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas the diffuse lighter band most likely reflects the partially processed but immature intracellular SNAT2 protein. Indeed, in vitro deglycosylation of total membranes with PNGaseF results in loss of the “heavier” immunoreactive band and detection of a more defined 40 kDa band that most likely represents the unprocessed core SNAT2 protein (Fig. 2A). Our findings reveal that HeLa cells also displa"

https://openalex.org/W2076860924,"Glypican-3 (GPC3) is one of the six members of the mammalian glypican family. We have previously reported that GPC3 inhibits Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by competing with Patched (Ptc) for Hh binding. We also showed that GPC3 binds with high affinity to Hh through its core protein, but that it does not interact with Ptc. Several members of the glypican family, including GPC3, are subjected to an endoproteolytic cleavage by the furin-like convertase family of endoproteases. Surprisingly, however, we have found that a mutant GPC3 that cannot be processed by convertases is as potent as wild-type GPC3 in stimulating Wnt activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and 293T cells and in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma growth. In this study, we show that processing by convertases is essential for GPC3-induced inhibition of Hh signaling. Moreover, we show that a convertase-resistant GPC3 stimulates Hh signaling by increasing the binding of this growth factor to Ptc. Consistent with this, we show that the convertase-resistant mutant binds to both Hh and Ptc through its heparan sulfate (HS) chains. Unexpectedly, we found that the mutant core protein does not bind to Hh. We also report that the convertase-resistant mutant GPC3 carries HS chains with a significantly higher degree of sulfation than those of wild-type GPC3. We propose that the structural changes generated by the lack of cleavage determine a change in the sulfation of the HS chains and that these hypersulfated chains mediate the interaction of the mutant GPC3 with Ptc."

Host cell cycle alteration is a sophisticated mechanism used by pathogens to hijack the defense functions of host cells. We previously demonstrated that S. aureus MW2 (USA400) bacteria induced a G2/M phase transition delay in HeLa cells. We demonstrate here that this activity is triggered by culture supernatant compounds. Using size exclusion chromatography of the MW2 supernatant, followed by mass spectroscopy analysis of corresponding peaks, we identified phenol-soluble modulin α (PSMα) peptides as the likely candidates for this effect. Indeed, synthetic PSMα 1 and PSMα3 caused a G2/M phase transition delay. The implication of PSMα in cell cycle alteration was confirmed by comparison of S. aureus Los Angeles County clone (LAC) wild-type with the isogenic mutant LACΔpsmα, which lacks the psmα operon encoding PSMα1-4. PSMα-induced G2/M transition delay correlated with a decrease in the defensin genes expression suggesting a diminution of antibacterial functions of epithelial cells. By testing the supernatant of S. aureus human clinical isolates, we found that the degree of G2/M phase transition delay correlated with PSMα1 production.

https://openalex.org/W2033910499,"To examine the consequences of early-onset hearing loss on several social and health measures and any related gender differences in Japanese populations.Data from a 2007 nationally representative cross-sectional household survey of 136,849 men and women aged 20 to 39 years were obtained (prevalence of self-reported hearing loss: 0.74%). We focused particularly on four social and health measures: employment status (employed/unemployed), marital status (married/unmarried), smoking behavior (yes/no), and psychological distress (K6 instrument: ≥ 5 or not). We examined the association of hearing loss for each measure using generalized estimating equations to account for correlated individuals within households.There was no significant association with employment status (p = 0.447). Men with hearing loss were more likely to be married, whereas women with hearing loss were less likely to be married (p < 0.001 for interaction). Although hearing loss was not associated with a current smoking status in men, women with hearing loss were more likely to be current smokers (p < 0.001 for interaction). Moreover, hearing loss was associated with psychological distress in men and women (both p < 0.001).These findings suggest that hearing loss is related to social and health issues in daily life, including a lower likelihood of marriage, more frequent smoking, and poorer mental health, especially in women. These issues may reflect a gap between the actual needs of women with hearing loss and the formal support received as a result of existing public health policies in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W1999920812,"Teneurins are large type II transmembrane proteins that are necessary for the normal development of the CNS. Although many studies highlight the significance of teneurins, especially during development, there is only limited information known about the molecular mechanisms of function. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal intracellular domain (ICD) of teneurins can be cleaved at the membrane and subsequently translocates to the nucleus, where it can influence gene transcription. Because teneurin ICDs do not contain any intrinsic DNA binding sequences, interaction partners are required to affect transcription. Here, we identified histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (HINT1) as a human teneurin-1 ICD interaction partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen. This interaction was confirmed in human cells, where HINT1 is known to inhibit the transcription of target genes by directly binding to transcription factors at the promoter. In a whole transcriptome analysis of BS149 glioblastoma cells overexpressing the teneurin-1 ICD, several microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) target genes were found to be up-regulated. Directly comparing the transcriptomes of MITF versus TEN1-ICD-overexpressing BS149 cells revealed 42 co-regulated genes, including glycoprotein non-metastatic b (GPNMB). Using real-time quantitative PCR to detect endogenous GPNMB expression upon overexpression of MITF and HINT1 as well as promoter reporter assays using GPNMB promoter constructs, we could demonstrate that the teneurin-1 ICD binds HINT1, thus switching on MITF-dependent transcription of GPNMB.

https://openalex.org/W2045288008,"Introduction Preterm birth is associated with increased risk of asthma-like symptoms and purchase of prescription asthma medication in childhood. We investigated whether this association persists into adulthood and whether it is affected by accounting for neonatal respiratory morbidity (acute respiratory disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Methods A national cohort of all infants born in Denmark in the period 1980–2009 was included in this register study. Data on purchase of asthma medication (combination of inhaled β-2 agonists and other drugs for obstructive airway disease) in 2010–2011 were obtained from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Associations between gestational age (GA), neonatal respiratory morbidity and a cross-sectional evaluation of asthma medication purchase were explored by multivariate logistic regressions. Results A full dataset was obtained on 1,790,241 individuals, 84.6% of all infants born in the period. Odds-ratios (95% CI) for the association between GA and purchase of asthma medication during infancy were: 3.86 (2.46–6.04) in GA 23–27 weeks, 2.37 (1.84–3.04) in GA 28–31 weeks and 1.59 (1.43–1.77) in GA 32–36 weeks compared to term infants with GA 37–42 weeks. Associations weakened in older age groups and became insignificant in young adults born extremely and very preterm with odds-ratios: 1.41 (0.63–3.19) and 1.15 (0.83–1.60) in GA 23–27 and 28–31 respectively. When adjusting for neonatal respiratory morbidity, the associations weakened but persisted both in childhood and adolescence. Conclusion There was a strong dose-response association between gestational age and the purchase of prescription asthma medication in infancy and childhood. This association weakened during adolescence and was mostly non-significant in young adulthood. The increased risk of prescription asthma medication purchase in ex-preterm children could only partly be explained by neonatal respiratory morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2100840632,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) oxygenates arachidonic acid (AA) and the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and arachidonylethanolamide to prostaglandins, prostaglandin glyceryl esters, and prostaglandin ethanolamides, respectively. A structural homodimer, COX-2 acts as a conformational heterodimer with a catalytic and an allosteric monomer. Prior studies have demonstrated substrate-selective negative allosteric regulation of 2-AG oxygenation. Here we describe AM-8138 (13(S)-methylarachidonic acid), a substrate-selective allosteric potentiator that augments 2-AG oxygenation by up to 3.5-fold with no effect on AA oxygenation. In the crystal structure of an AM-8138·COX-2 complex, AM-8138 adopts a conformation similar to the unproductive conformation of AA in the substrate binding site. Kinetic analysis suggests that binding of AM-8138 to the allosteric monomer of COX-2 increases 2-AG oxygenation by increasing kcat and preventing inhibitory binding of 2-AG. AM-8138 restored the activity of COX-2 mutants that exhibited very poor 2-AG oxygenating activity and increased the activity of COX-1 toward 2-AG. Competition of AM-8138 for the allosteric site prevented the inhibition of COX-2-dependent 2-AG oxygenation by substrate-selective inhibitors and blocked the inhibition of AA or 2-AG oxygenation by nonselective time-dependent inhibitors. AM-8138 selectively enhanced 2-AG oxygenation in intact RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells. Thus, AM-8138 is an important new tool compound for the exploration of allosteric modulation of COX enzymes and their role in endocannabinoid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2130277580,"While it has been suggested that malocclusion is linked with urbanisation, it remains unclear as to whether its high prevalence began 8,000 years earlier concomitant with the transition to agriculture. Here we investigate the extent to which patterns of affinity (i.e., among-population distances), based on mandibular form and dental dimensions, respectively, match across Epipalaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic samples from the Near East/Anatolia and Europe. Analyses were conducted using morphological distance matrices reflecting dental and mandibular form for the same 292 individuals across 21 archaeological populations. Thereafter, statistical analyses were undertaken on four sample aggregates defined on the basis of their subsistence strategy, geography, and chronology to test for potential differences in dental and mandibular form across and within groups. Results show a clear separation based on mandibular morphology between European hunter-gatherers, European farmers, and Near Eastern transitional farmers and semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers. In contrast, the dental dimensions show no such pattern and no clear association between the position of samples and their temporal or geographic attributes. Although later farming groups have, on average, smaller teeth and mandibles, shape analyses show that the mandibles of farmers are not simply size-reduced versions of earlier hunter-gatherer mandibles. Instead, it appears that mandibular form underwent a complex series of shape changes commensurate with the transition to agriculture that are not reflected in affinity patterns based on dental dimensions. In the case of hunter-gatherers there is a correlation between inter-individual mandibular and dental distances, suggesting an equilibrium between these two closely associated morphological units. However, in the case of semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers and farming groups, no such correlation was found, suggesting that the incongruity between dental and mandibular form began with the shift towards sedentism and agricultural subsistence practices in the core region of the Near East and Anatolia."
https://openalex.org/W1997035038,The bacterial gene regulatory regions often demonstrate distinctly organized arrays of RNA polymerase binding sites of ill-defined function. Previously we observed a module of closely spaced polymerase binding sites upstream of the canonical promoter of the Escherichia coli fis operon. FIS is an abundant nucleoid-associated protein involved in adjusting the chromosomal DNA topology to changing cellular physiology. Here we show that simultaneous binding of the polymerase at the canonical fis promoter and an upstream transcriptionally inactive site stabilizes a RNAP oligomeric complex in vitro. We further show that modulation of the upstream binding of RNA polymerase affects the fis promoter activity both in vivo and in vitro. The effect of the upstream RNA polymerase binding on the fis promoter activity depends on the spatial arrangement of polymerase binding sites and DNA supercoiling. Our data suggest that a specific DNA geometry of the nucleoprotein complex stabilized on concomitant binding of RNA polymerase molecules at the fis promoter and the upstream region acts as a topological device regulating the fis transcription. We propose that transcriptionally inactive RNA polymerase molecules can act as accessory factors regulating the transcription initiation from a nearby promoter.
https://openalex.org/W2087661473,"Lateral flow tests also known as Immunochromatography (IC) is an antigen-detection method conducted on a nitrocellulose membrane that can be completed in less than 20 min. IC has been used as an important rapid test for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of influenza viruses, but the IC sensitivity is relatively low (approximately 60%) and the limit of detection (LOD) is as low as 10³ pfu per reaction. Recently, we reported an improved IC assay using antibodies conjugated with fluorescent beads (fluorescent immunochromatography; FLIC) for subtyping H5 influenza viruses (FLIC-H5). Although the FLIC strip must be scanned using a fluorescent reader, the sensitivity (LOD) is significantly improved over that of conventional IC methods. In addition, the antibodies which are specific against the subtypes of influenza viruses cannot be available for the detection of other subtypes when the major antigenicity will be changed. In this study, we established the use of FLIC to type seasonal influenza A and B viruses (FLIC-AB). This method has improved sensitivity to 100-fold higher than that of conventional IC methods when we used several strains of influenza viruses. In addition, FLIC-AB demonstrated the ability to detect influenza type A and influenza type B viruses from clinical samples with high sensitivity and specificity (Type A: sensitivity 98.7% (74/75), specificity 100% (54/54), Type B: sensitivity 100% (90/90), specificity 98.2% (54/55) in nasal swab samples) in comparison to the results of qRT-PCR. And furthermore, FLIC-AB performs better in the detection of early stage infection (under 13 h) than other conventional IC methods. Our results provide new strategies to prevent the early-stage transmission of influenza viruses in humans during both seasonal outbreaks and pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W2039165650,"Protein-protein interactions are important in providing compartmentalization and specificity in cellular signal transduction. Many studies have hallmarked the well designed compartmentalization of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) through its anchoring proteins. Much less data are available on the compartmentalization of its closest homolog, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), via its own PKG anchoring proteins (GKAPs). For the enrichment, screening, and discovery of (novel) PKA anchoring proteins, a plethora of methodologies is available, including our previously described chemical proteomics approach based on immobilized cAMP or cGMP. Although this method was demonstrated to be effective, each immobilized cyclic nucleotide did not discriminate in the enrichment for either PKA or PKG and their secondary interactors. Hence, with PKG signaling components being less abundant in most tissues, it turned out to be challenging to enrich and identify GKAPs. Here we extend this cAMP-based chemical proteomics approach using competitive concentrations of free cyclic nucleotides to isolate each kinase and its secondary interactors. Using this approach, we identified Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) as a putative novel GKAP. Through sequence alignment with known GKAPs and secondary structure prediction analysis, we defined a small sequence domain mediating the interaction with PKG Iβ but not PKG Iα. In vitro binding studies and site-directed mutagenesis further confirmed the specificity and affinity of HAP1 binding to the PKG Iβ N terminus. These data fully support that HAP1 is a GKAP, anchoring specifically to the cGMP-dependent protein kinase isoform Iβ, and provide further evidence that also PKG spatiotemporal signaling is largely controlled by anchoring proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2071625197,"Temporal patterns of species abundance, although less well-studied than spatial patterns, provide valuable insight to the processes governing community assembly. We compared temporal abundance distributions of two communities, phytoplankton and fish, in a north temperate lake. We used both 17 years of observed relative abundance data as well as resampled data from Monte Carlo simulations to account for the possible effects of non-detection of rare species. Similar to what has been found in other communities, phytoplankton and fish species that appeared more frequently were generally more abundant than rare species. However, neither community exhibited two distinct groups of “core” (common occurrence and high abundance) and “occasional” (rare occurrence and low abundance) species. Both observed and resampled data show that the phytoplankton community was dominated by occasional species appearing in only one year that exhibited large variation in their abundances, while the fish community was dominated by core species occurring in all 17 years at high abundances. We hypothesize that the life-history traits that enable phytoplankton to persist in highly dynamic environments may result in communities dominated by occasional species capable of reaching high abundances when conditions allow. Conversely, longer turnover times and broad environmental tolerances of fish may result in communities dominated by core species structured primarily by competitive interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2022159715,"Receptor levels are a key mechanism by which cells regulate their response to stimuli. The levels of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) impact breast cancer cell proliferation and are used to predict prognosis and sensitivity to endocrine therapy. Despite the clinical application of this information, it remains unclear how different cellular processes interact as a system to control ERα levels. To address this question, experimental results from the ERα-positive human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) treated with 17-β-estradiol or vehicle control were used to develop a mass-action kinetic model of ERα regulation. Model analysis determined that RNA dynamics could be captured through phosphorylated ERα (pERα)-dependent feedback on transcription. Experimental analysis confirmed that pERα-S118 binds to the estrogen receptor-1 (ESR1) promoter, suggesting that pERα can feedback on ESR1 transcription. Protein dynamics required a separate mechanism in which the degradation rate for pERα was 8.3-fold higher than nonphosphor..."
https://openalex.org/W2004112187,"The postcranial evidence for the Australopithecus genus indicates that australopiths were able bipeds; however, the morphology of the forelimbs and particularly that of the shoulder girdle suggests that they were partially adapted to an arboreal lifestyle. The nature of such arboreal adaptations is still unclear, as are the kind of arboreal behaviors in which australopiths might have engaged. In this study we analyzed the shape of the shoulder joint (proximal humerus and glenoid cavity of the scapula) of three australopith specimens: A.L. 288–1 (A. afarensis), Sts 7 (A. africanus) and Omo 119–73–2718 (Australopithecus sp.) with three-dimensional geometric morphometrics. The morphology of the specimens was compared with that of a wide array of living anthropoid taxa and some additional fossil hominins (the Homo erectus specimen KNM-WT 15000 and the H. neanderthalensis specimen Tabun 1). Our results indicate that A.L. 288–1 shows mosaic traits resembling H. sapiens and Pongo, whereas the Sts 7 shoulder is most similar to the arboreal apes and does not present affinities with H. sapiens. Omo 119–73–2718 exhibits morphological affinities with the more arboreal and partially suspensory New World monkey Lagothrix. The shoulder of the australopith specimens thus shows a combination of primitive and derived traits (humeral globularity, enhancement of internal and external rotation of the joint), related to use of the arm in overhead positions. The genus Homo specimens show overall affinities with H. sapiens at the shoulder, indicating full correspondence of these hominin shoulders with the modern human morphotype."
https://openalex.org/W1999590747,"When patients lack sufficient treatment options for serious medical conditions, they rely on the prompt approval and development of new therapeutic alternatives, such as medical devices. Understanding the development of innovative medical devices, including the characteristics of premarket clinical trials and length of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review, can help identify ways to expedite patient access to novel technologies and inform recent efforts by FDA to more quickly get these products to patients and physicians. We analyzed publicly available information on clinical trials and premarket FDA review for innovative medical devices that fill an unmet medical need. In this first-of-its-kind study focusing on these products, we extracted data on the length of the pivotal trials, primary study endpoint and FDA review; number of patients enrolled in trials; and in what country the device was available first. We identified 27 approved priority review devices from January 2006 through August 2013. The median duration of pivotal clinical trials was 3 years, ranging from 3 months to approximately 7 years. Trials had a median primary outcome measure evaluation time of one year and a median enrollment of 297 patients. The median FDA review time was 1 year and 3 months. Most priority review devices were available abroad before they were approved in the United States. Our study indicates that addressing the length of clinical studies—and contributing factors, such as primary outcome measures and enrollment—could expedite patient access to innovative medical devices. FDA, manufacturers, Congress and other stakeholders should identify the contributing factors to the length of clinical development, and implement appropriate reforms to address those issues."
https://openalex.org/W2010446764,"NCX1 is a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, which is believed to provide a key route for basolateral Ca2+ efflux in the renal epithelia, thus contributing to renal Ca2+ reabsorption. Altered mineral homeostasis, including intestinal and renal Ca2+ transport may represent a significant component of the pathophysiology of the bone mineral density loss associated with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). The objective of our research was to investigate the effects of TNBS and DSS colitis and related inflammatory mediators on renal Ncx1 expression. Colitis was associated with decreased renal Ncx1 expression, as examined by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. In mIMCD3 cells, IFNγ significantly reduced Ncx1 mRNA and protein expression. Similar effects were observed in cells transiently transfected with a reporter construct bearing the promoter region of the kidney-specific Ncx1 gene. This inhibitory effect of IFNγ is mediated by STAT1 recruitment to the proximal promoter region of Ncx1. Further in vivo study with Stat1−/− mice confirmed that STAT1 is indeed required for the IFNγ mediated Ncx1 gene regulation. These results strongly support the hypothesis that impaired renal Ca2+ handling occurs in experimental colitis. Negative regulation of NCX1- mediated renal Ca2+ absorption by IFNγ may significantly contribute to the altered Ca2+ homeostasis in IBD patients and to IBD-associated loss of bone mineral density."
