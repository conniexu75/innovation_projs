https://openalex.org/W2784805535,"Animal movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species survival, yet the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on animal movements have not been estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in areas with a comparatively high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their movements in areas with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction to behavioral changes of individual animals and to the exclusion of species with long-range movements from areas with higher human impact. Global loss of vagility alters a key ecological trait of animals that affects not only population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2791004613,"The peripheral sensory nerves that innervate the cornea can be easily damaged by trauma, surgery, infection or diabetes. Several growth factors and axon guidance molecules, such as Semaphorin3A (Sema3A) are upregulated upon cornea injury. Nerves can regenerate after injury but do not recover their original density and patterning. Sema3A is a well known axon guidance and growth cone repellent protein during development, however its role in adult cornea nerve regeneration remains undetermined. Here we investigated the neuro-regenerative potential of Sema3A on adult peripheral nervous system neurons such as those that innervate the cornea. First, we examined the gene expression profile of the Semaphorin class 3 family members and found that all are expressed in the cornea. However, upon cornea injury there is a fast increase in Sema3A expression. We then corroborated that Sema3A totally abolished the growth promoting effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) on embryonic neurons and observed signs of growth cone collapse and axonal retraction after 30 min of Sema3A addition. However, in adult isolated trigeminal ganglia or dorsal root ganglia neurons, Sema3A did not inhibited the NGF-induced neuronal growth. Furthermore, adult neurons treated with Sema3A alone produced similar neuronal growth to cells treated with NGF and the length of the neurites and branching was comparable between both treatments. These effects were replicated in vivo, where thy1-YFP neurofluorescent mice subjected to cornea epithelium debridement and receiving intrastromal pellet implantation containing Sema3A showed increased corneal nerve regeneration than those receiving pellets with vehicle. In adult PNS neurons, Sema3A is a potent inducer of neuronal growth in vitro and cornea nerve regeneration in vivo. Our data indicates a functional switch for the role of Sema3A in PNS neurons where the well-described repulsive role during development changes to a growth promoting effect during adulthood. The high expression of Sema3A in the normal and injured adult corneas could be related to its role as a growth factor."

This indirect effect is referred to as “genetic nurture.” Kong et al. used data from genome-wide association studies of educational attainment to construct polygenic scores for parents that only considered the nontransmitted alleles (see the Perspective by Koellinger and Harden). The findings suggest that genetic nurture is ultimately due to genetic variation in the population and is mediated by the environment that parents create for their children.

Doron et al. took advantage of this property to map microbial defense systems systematically (see the Perspective by Kim). Candidate immune systems were then experimentally validated for their activities. Like well-known defense arsenals such as restriction-modification and CRISPR systems, these additional immune systems now require mechanistic investigation and could potentially be engineered into useful molecular tools in the future.

Lamb et al. surveyed 159 coral reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. Billions of plastic items were entangled in the reefs. The more spikey the coral species, the more likely they were to snag plastic. Disease likelihood increased 20-fold once a coral was draped in plastic. Plastic debris stresses coral through light deprivation, toxin release, and anoxia, giving pathogens a foothold for invasion.

Wu et al. tackle this issue by determining the underlying mechanisms in unprocessed magnesium alloys. Dilute amounts of solutes enhanced certain ductility-improving mechanisms over ones that cause brittle fracture. From this, the authors developed a theory that may be helpful for screening the large number of potential magnesium alloy compositions. Science , this issue p. 447"
https://openalex.org/W2784697242,"A path to multidrug resistance Permeability glycoprotein (PgP) uses the energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to transport substrates out of the cell. Many of its substrates are drugs, so it plays an important role in drug resistance. Structures in the inward-facing conformation have been determined for mouse, yeast, and algal PgP. Kim and Chen present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of human PgP in an outward-facing conformation. Two ATP molecules are bound between two nucleotide-binding domains. The substrate-binding site, located in the transmembrane domain, is open to the outside of the cell, but compressed, and no substrate is bound. This suggests that ATP binding, rather than ATP hydrolysis, promotes the transition to the outward-facing conformation and substrate release. Science , this issue p. 915"

https://openalex.org/W2767838051,"We report the strong coupling of a single electron spin and a single microwave photon. The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity photon couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. This result opens the way to the realization of large networks of quantum dot based spin qubit registers, removing a major roadblock to scalable quantum computing with spin qubits."
https://openalex.org/W2784380241,"Up with ultrafine aerosol particles Ultrafine aerosol particles (smaller than 50 nanometers in diameter) have been thought to be too small to affect cloud formation. Fan et al. show that this is not the case. They studied the effect of urban pollution transported into the otherwise nearly pristine atmosphere of the Amazon. Condensational growth of water droplets around the tiny particles releases latent heat, thereby intensifying atmospheric convection. Thus, anthropogenic ultrafine aerosol particles may exert a more important influence on cloud formation processes than previously believed. Science , this issue p. 411"

We demonstrate the valley-dependent directional coupling of light using a plasmonic nanowire-tungsten disulfide (WS2) layers system. We show that the valley pseudospin in WS2 couples to transverse optical spin of the same handedness with a directional coupling efficiency of 90 ± 1%. Our results provide a platform for controlling, detecting, and processing valley and spin information with precise optical control at the nanoscale."
https://openalex.org/W2784600881,"Mouse heart development arises from Mesp1-expressing cardiovascular progenitors (CPs) that are specified during gastrulation. The molecular processes that control early regional and lineage segregation of CPs have been unclear. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of wild-type and Mesp1-null CPs in mice. We showed that populations of Mesp1 CPs are molecularly distinct and span the continuum between epiblast and later mesodermal cells, including hematopoietic progenitors. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of Mesp1-deficient CPs showed that Mesp1 is required for the exit from the pluripotent state and the induction of the cardiovascular gene expression program. We identified distinct populations of Mesp1 CPs that correspond to progenitors committed to different cell lineages and regions of the heart, identifying the molecular features associated with early lineage restriction and regional segregation of the heart at the early stage of mouse gastrulation."

Tu et al. used a genetic screen to pinpoint candidate genes that might encode such a protein from mouse taste receptor cells (see the Perspective by Montell). They identified the known protein otopetrin and showed that it conferred proton conductance when expressed in cultured human cells. Their results indicate that otopetrin may function in sensory recognition of sour (acidic) taste in humans and other organisms. Science , this issue p. 1047 ; see also p. 991"
https://openalex.org/W2785016696,"The neuronal population is the key unit The responses of pairs of neurons to repeated presentations of the same stimulus are typically correlated, and an identical neuronal population can perform many functions. This suggests that the relevant units of computation are not single neurons but subspaces of the complete population activity. To test this idea, Ni et al. measured the relationship between neuronal population activity and performance in monkeys. They investigated attention, which improves perception of attended stimuli, and perceptual learning, which improves perception of well-practiced stimuli. These two processes operate on different time scales and are usually studied using different perceptual tasks. Manipulation of attention and learning in the same behavioral trials and the same neuronal populations revealed the dimensions of population activity that matter most for behavior.

https://openalex.org/W2785008128,"The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 58 members of the solute carrier family SLC25, also called the mitochondrial carrier family, many of which have been shown to transport specific metabolites, nucleotides, and cofactors across the mitochondrial membrane. Here, two Arabidopsis members of this family, AtUCP1 and AtUCP2, which were previously thought to be uncoupling proteins and hence named UCP1/PUMP1 and UCP2/PUMP2, respectively, are assigned with a novel function. They were expressed in bacteria, purified, and reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles. Their transport properties demonstrate that they transport amino acids (aspartate, glutamate, cysteine sulfinate, and cysteate), dicarboxylates (malate, oxaloacetate, and 2-oxoglutarate), phosphate, sulfate, and thiosulfate. Transport was saturable and inhibited by mercurials and other mitochondrial carrier inhibitors to various degrees. AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 catalyzed a fast counterexchange transport as well as a low uniport of substrates, with transport rates of AtUCP1 being much higher than those of AtUCP2 in both cases. The aspartate/glutamate heteroexchange mediated by AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 is electroneutral, in contrast to that mediated by the mammalian mitochondrial aspartate glutamate carrier. Furthermore, both carriers were found to be targeted to mitochondria. Metabolite profiling of single and double knockouts shows changes in organic acid and amino acid levels. Notably, AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 are the first reported mitochondrial carriers in Arabidopsis to transport aspartate and glutamate. It is proposed that the primary function of AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 is to catalyze an aspartateout/glutamatein exchange across the mitochondrial membrane and thereby contribute to the export of reducing equivalents from the mitochondria in photorespiration.

It is important to note that some of the carriers characterized from Arabidopsis have broader substrate specificities than their human and yeast counterparts, and additionally some of them are localized in compartments other than the mitochondria, such as peroxisomes, chloroplasts, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the plasma membrane (1Palmieri F.

On the basis of homology with subsequently sequenced MCs, a UCP subfamily was identified containing six members in both humans (hUCP1–6) and Arabidopsis (AtUCP1–6). However, AtUCP4–6 were subsequently renamed dicarboxylate carriers (DIC1–3), following the demonstration that they transport malate, oxaloacetate, succinate, Pi, sulfate, thiosulfate, and sulfite (24Palmieri L.

In the current study, we investigated the potential transport properties of the two closest homologs of hUCP2 in Arabidopsis: AtUCP1 and AtUCP2, also known as PUMP1 and PUMP2.

By contrast, very little is known about AtUCP2; in a proteomic study, it was detected in the Golgi (38Parsons H.T. Christiansen K. Knierim B. Carroll A. Ito J. Batth T.S. Smith-Moritz A.M.

The results presented here demonstrate that AtUCP1 and the less-studied AtUCP2 are mitochondrially localized isoforms and have a broad substrate specificity, transporting a variety of substrates, including aspartate, glutamate, malate, oxaloacetate, and other metabolites. Characterization of metabolite profiles of T-DNA insertional knockout mutants, including a ucp1/ucp2 double mutant, revealed clear changes in organic acid levels, some of which were exacerbated by the application of salt stress. The protein sequences of AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 homologs were collected, aligned, and analyzed (Fig. S1). AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 share 72% identical amino acids. Their sequences are much more similar to each other than to any other Arabidopsis protein; in Arabidopsis, the closest relative to AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 is AtDIC2, which shares 41 and 42% sequence identity with AtUCP1 and AtUCP2, respectively. In humans and S. cerevisiae, the closest homologs are hUCP2 (34Vozza A. Parisi G. De Leonardis F. Lasorsa F.M. Castegna A. Amorese D. Marmo R. Calcagnile V.M. Palmieri L. Ricquier D. Paradies E.

Putative orthologs with high sequence identity with AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 above 75% were found in several plant species. Moreover, from structural sequence alignments using the X-ray structure of the bovine ADP/ATP carrier (6Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G. Structure of mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier in complex with carboxyatractyloside.Nature. 2003; 426 (14603310): 39-4410.1038/nature02056Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) as a template, it can be deduced that 85 and 54% of the residues lining the surface of the substrate translocation pore are identical between AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 and between AtUCP1, AtUCP2, and hUCP2, respectively. These results suggest that AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 are isoforms, and their closest homolog with identified substrates is hUCP2. AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strains (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 7). They accumulated as inclusion bodies and were purified by centrifugation and washing (see “Experimental procedures”). The apparent molecular masses of purified AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 8) were ∼31 kDa, which is in good agreement with the calculated value of 33 kDa for both AtUCP1 and AtUCP2. The identities of the recombinant proteins were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and the yield of the purified proteins was about 10 and 2 mg/liter of culture for AtUCP1 and AtUCP2, respectively. The proteins were detected neither in non-induced cultures nor in cultures with an empty vector (Fig. 1, lanes 1, 2, 3, and 6). Recombinant AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 were reconstituted into liposomes, and their transport activities for various radioactive substrates were tested in homo-exchange experiments (i.e. with the same external (1 mm) and internal (10 mm) substrate). In a first set of homo-exchange experiments, time-dependent uptake of several radioactive substrates (aspartate, malate, and glutamate for reconstituted AtUCP1 and AtUCP2; malonate and sulfate for AtUCP1; and 2-oxoglutarate for AtUCP2) demonstrated typical curves for carrier-mediated transport (Fig. 2, A and B). Both AtUCP1- and AtUCP2-mediated homo-exchanges between external [14C]aspartate and internal aspartate were temperature-dependent (Fig. 2, C and D), as would be expected for protein-catalyzed transport. Furthermore, no [14C]aspartate/aspartate or [14C]malate/malate exchange activity was detected if AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 had been boiled before incorporation into liposomes or if proteoliposomes were reconstituted with lauric acid/sarkosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells lacking the expression vector for AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 or harvested immediately before induction of expression (data not shown). In all of these experiments, a mixture of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate and bathophenanthroline was used to block the AtUCP1- and AtUCP2-mediated transport reactions at various time points. In addition, AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 were found to catalyze homo-exchanges of glutamate, malonate, malate, succinate, and Pi, whereas no or very low transport was observed with glutamine, arginine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, proline, γ-aminobutyrate, citrate, ATP, GTP, S-adenosylmethionine, or glutathione (Fig. 3).Figure 3AtUCP1- and AtUCP2-mediated homo-exchanges of various substrates. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with AtUCP1 (A) and AtUCP2 (B) were preloaded internally with the substrates indicated in the figure (concentration, 10 mm). Transport was initiated by adding radioactive substrate (concentration, 1 mm) to proteoliposomes containing the same substrate. The reaction was terminated after 30 min. The values are means ± S.E.

SAM, S-adenosylmethionine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The substrate specificities of AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 were examined in detail by measuring the initial rate of [14C]aspartate uptake into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with various potential substrates (Fig. 4). For both AtUCP1 and AtUCP2, the highest activities were observed in the presence of internal aspartate, glutamate, cysteine sulfinate, cysteate, malonate, malate, oxaloacetate, maleate, and (for AtUCP2) 2-oxoglutarate. Both proteins also exchanged, albeit to a lower extent, internal d-aspartate, cysteine, oxalate, succinate, 2-oxoglutarate, α-aminoadipate, Pi, sulfate, and thiosulfate. In addition, AtUCP2 exchanged [14C]aspartate with the internal substrates (Fig. 4B) fumarate, glutarate, and nitrate, which were not significantly transported by AtUCP1 (Fig. 4A). By contrast, the uptake of labeled aspartate by AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 was negligible with internal asparagine, d-glutamate, glutamine, serine, glycine, homocysteate, adipate, α-ketoadipate, pyrophosphate, citrate, pyruvate, lactate, phosphoenolpyruvate, acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, N-acetylaspartate, ATP, and glutathione (Fig. 4, A and B). The activity in the presence of these substrates was approximately the same as that observed in the presence of NaCl and no substrate. The effects of other mitochondrial carrier inhibitors on the [14C]aspartate/aspartate exchange reaction catalyzed by reconstituted AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 were also examined. This transport activity was inhibited strongly by bathophenanthroline, pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, and tannic acid and markedly by mersalyl, HgCl2, and butylmalonate (Fig. 5). Phenylsuccinate and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate strongly inhibited AtUCP1 and partially inhibited AtUCP2, whereas bromcresol purple and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate caused partial inhibition of both carriers. By contrast, carboxyatractyloside, bongkrekic acid, and N-ethylmaleimide had little or no effect on either AtUCP1 or AtUCP2 activity.

The [14C]aspartate/aspartate and [14C]malate/malate exchanges followed first-order kinetics (rate constants 1.6 and 1.4 min−1 (AtUCP1) or 0.27 and 0.23 min−1 (AtUCP2); initial rates 14 and 11 mmol/min × g of prot"
https://openalex.org/W2785156213,"Zinc is a metal ion that is an essential cell signaling molecule. Highlighting this, zinc is an insulin mimetic, activating cellular pathways that regulate cellular homeostasis and physiological responses. Previous studies have linked dysfunctional zinc signaling with several disease states including cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The present study evaluated the insulin-like effects of zinc on cell signaling molecules including tyrosine, PRSA40, Akt, ERK1/2, SHP-2, GSK-3β and p38, and glucose oxidation in human and mouse skeletal muscle cells. Insulin and zinc independently led to the phosphorylation of these proteins over a 60-minute time course in both mouse and human skeletal muscle cells. Similarly, utilizing a protein array we identified that zinc could active the phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and GSK-3B in human and ERK1/2 and GSK-3B in mouse skeletal muscle cells. Glucose oxidation assays were performed on skeletal muscle cells treated with insulin, zinc, or a combination of both and resulted in a significant induction of glucose consumption in mouse (p<0.01) and human (p<0.05) skeletal muscle cells when treated with zinc alone. Insulin, as expected, increased glucose oxidation in mouse (p<0.001) and human (0.001) skeletal muscle cells, however the combination of zinc and insulin did not augment glucose consumption in these cells. Zinc acts as an insulin mimetic, activating key molecules implicated in cell signaling to maintain glucose homeostasis in mouse and human skeletal muscle cells. Zinc is an important metal ion implicated in several biological processes. The role of zinc as an insulin memetic in activating key signaling molecules involved in glucose homeostasis could provide opportunities to utilize this ion therapeutically in treating disorders associated with dysfunctional zinc signaling."

We determined rates and factors associated with LTFU in HIV care Lilongwe, Malawi. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected individuals aged 15 years or older at the time of registration for HIV care in 12 ART facilities, between April 2012 and March 2013. HIV-positive individuals who had not started ART (pre-ART patients) were clinically assessed to determine ART eligibility at registration and during clinic follow-up visits. ART-eligible patients were initiated on triple antiretroviral combination. Study data were abstracted from patients’ cards, facility ART registers or electronic medical record system from the date of registration for HIV care to a maximum follow-up period of 24 months. Descriptive statistics were undertaken to summarize characteristics of the study patients. Separate univariable and multivariable poisson regression models were used to explore factors associated with LTFU in pre-ART and ART care. Results A total of 10,812 HIV-infected individuals registered for HIV care. Of these patients, 1,907 (18%) and 8,905 (82%) enrolled in pre-ART and ART care, respectively. Of the 1,907 pre-ART patients, 490 (26%) subsequently initiated ART and were included in both the pre-ART and ART analyses. The LTFU rates among patients in pre-ART and ART care were 48 and 26 per 100 person-years, respectively. Of the 9,105 ART patients with reasons for starting ART, 2,451 (27%) were initiated on ART because of pregnancy or breastfeeding (Option B+) status. Multivariable analysis showed that being ≥35 years and female were associated with decreased risk of LTFU in the pre-ART and ART phases of HIV care. However, being in WHO clinical stage 3 (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20–1.51) and stage 4 (aRR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.62–2.18), body mass index ≤ 18.4 (aRR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.11–1.39) at ART initiation, poor adherence to clinic appointments (aRR 4.55, 95% CI: 4.16–4.97) and receiving HIV care in rural facilities (aRR 2.32, 95% CI: 1.94–2.87) were associated with increased risk of LTFU among ART patients. Being re-initiated on ART once (aRR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.17–0.22), more than once (aRR 0.06, 95% CI: 0.05–0.07), and being enrolled at a low-volume facility (aRR 0.25, 95% CI: 0.20–0.30) were associated with decreased risk of LTFU from ART care. Conclusion A sizeable proportion of ART LTFU occurred among women enrolled during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Non- compliance to clinic and receiving ART in a rural facility or high-volume facility were associated with increased risk of LTFU from ART care. Developing effective interventions that target high-risk subgroups and contexts may help reduce LTFU from HIV care."

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of habitual physical activity and exercise types on physical performance across ages in community-living adults. The Longevity check-up 7+ (Lookup 7+) project is an ongoing cross-sectional survey conducted in unconventional settings (e.g., exhibitions, malls, and health promotion campaigns across Italy) that began on June 1st 2015. The project was designed to raise awareness in the general population on major lifestyle behaviors and risk factors for chronic diseases. Candidate participants are eligible for enrolment if they are at least 18 years of age and provide written informed consent. Physical performance is evaluated through the 5-repetition chair stand test. Analyses were conducted in 6,242 community-living adults enrolled between June 1st 2015 and June 30th 2017, after excluding 81 participants for missing values of the variables of interest. The mean age of the 6,242 participants was 54.4 years (standard deviation 15.2, range 18-98 years), and 3552 (57%) were women. The time to complete the chair stand test was similar from 18 to 40-44 years, and declined progressively across subsequent age groups. Overall, the performance on the chair stand test was better in physically active participants, who completed the test with a mean of 0.5 s less than sedentary enrollees (p < .001). After adjusting for potential confounders, a different distribution of physical performance across exercise intensities was observed, with better performance being recorded in participants engaged in more vigorous activities. Our findings suggest that regular physical activity modifies the age-related pattern of decline in physical performance, with greater benefits observed for more intensive activities. Efforts are needed from health authorities and healthcare providers to promote the large-scale adoption of an active lifestyle throughout the life course."

https://openalex.org/W2785010403,"Despite decades of research, the mechanism of action of the ABC multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) remains elusive. Due to experimental limitations, many researchers have turned to molecular dynamics simulation studies in order to investigate different aspects of P-gp function. However, such studies are challenging and caution is required when interpreting the results. P-gp is highly flexible and the time scale on which it can be simulated is limited. There is also uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the various crystal structures available, let alone the structure of the protein in a physiologically relevant environment. In this study, three alternative structural models of mouse P-gp (3G5U, 4KSB, 4M1M), all resolved to 3.8 Å, were used to initiate sets of simulations of P-gp in a membrane environment in order to determine: a) the sensitivity of the results to differences in the starting configuration; and b) the extent to which converged results could be expected on the times scales commonly simulated for this system. The simulations suggest that the arrangement of the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) observed in the crystal structures is not stable in a membrane environment. In all simulations, the NBDs rapidly associated (within 10 ns) and changes within the transmembrane helices were observed. The secondary structure within the transmembrane domain was best preserved in the 4M1M model under the simulation conditions used. However, the extent to which replicate simulations diverged on a 100 to 200 ns timescale meant that it was not possible to draw definitive conclusions as to which structure overall was most stable, or to obtain converged and reliable results for any of the properties examined. The work brings into question the reliability of conclusions made in regard to the nature of specific interactions inferred from previous simulation studies on this system involving similar sampling times. It also highlights the need to demonstrate the statistical significance of any results obtained in simulations of large flexible proteins, especially where the initial structure is uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W2793520656,"Biochar addition to soil not only sequesters carbon for the long-term but enhances agricultural productivity. Several well-known benefits arise from biochar amendment, including constant provision of nutrients, increased soil moisture retention, decreased soil bulk density, and sometimes the induction of systemic resistance against foliar and soil borne plant pathogens. However, no research has investigated the potential of biochar to increase resistance against herbivory. The white-backed plant hopper (WBPH) (Sogatella furcifera Horváth) is a serious agricultural pest that targets rice (Oryza sativa L.), a staple crop that feeds half of the world's human population. Therefore, we investigated the (1) optimization of biochar amendment levels for two rice varieties ('Cheongcheong' and 'Nagdong') and (2) subsequent effects of different biochar amendments on resistance and susceptibility of these two varieties to WBPH infestation. Initial screening results for the optimization level revealed that the application of biochar 10% (w/w) to the rooting media significantly improved plant physiological characteristics of both rice varieties. However, levels of biochar amendment, mainly 1, 2, 3, and 20%, resulted in negative effects on plant growth characteristics. Cheongcheong and Nagdong rice plants grown with the optimum biochar level showed contrasting reactions to WBPH infestation. Specifically, biochar application significantly increased plant growth characteristics of Nagdong when exposed to WBPH infestation and significantly decreased these characteristics in Cheongcheong. The amount of WBPH-induced damage to plants was significantly lower and higher in Nagdong and Cheongcheong, respectively, compared to that in the controls. Higher levels of jasmonic acid caused by the biochar priming effect could have accumulated in response to WBPH infestation, resulting in a maladaptive response to stress, negatively affecting growth and resistance to WBPH in Cheongcheong. This study highlights the importance of investigating the effects of biochar on different rice varieties before application on a commercial scale to avoid potential crop losses."
https://openalex.org/W2785330210,"Stimulation of renal collecting duct principal cells with antidiuretic hormone (arginine-vasopressin, AVP) results in inhibition of the small GTPase RhoA and the enrichment of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the plasma membrane. The membrane insertion facilitates water reabsorption from primary urine and fine-tuning of body water homeostasis. Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) interact with RhoA, catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP and thereby activate the GTPase. However, GEFs involved in the control of AQP2 in renal principal cells are unknown. The A-kinase anchoring protein, AKAP-Lbc, possesses GEF activity, specifically activates RhoA, and is expressed in primary renal inner medullary collecting duct principal (IMCD) cells. Through screening of 18,431 small molecules and synthesis of a focused library around one of the hits, we identified an inhibitor of the interaction of AKAP-Lbc and RhoA. This molecule, Scaff10-8, bound to RhoA, inhibited the AKAP-Lbc-mediated RhoA activation but did not interfere with RhoA activation through other GEFs or activities of other members of the Rho family of small GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42. Scaff10-8 promoted the redistribution of AQP2 from intracellular vesicles to the periphery of IMCD cells. Thus, our data demonstrate an involvement of AKAP-Lbc-mediated RhoA activation in the control of AQP2 trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2789216844,"In Fennoscandia, mountain hare (Lepus timidus) and brown hare (Lepus europaeus) hybridize and produce fertile offspring, resulting in gene flow across the species barrier. Analyses of maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) show that introgression occur frequently, but unavailability of appropriate nuclear DNA markers has made it difficult to evaluate the scale- and significance for the species. The extent of introgression has become important as the brown hare is continuously expanding its range northward, at the apparent expense of the mountain hare, raising concerns about possible competition. We report here, based on analysis of 6833 SNP markers, that the introgression is highly asymmetrical in the direction of gene flow from mountain hare to brown hare, and that the levels of nuclear gene introgression are independent of mtDNA introgression. While it is possible that brown hares obtain locally adapted alleles from the resident mountain hares, the low levels of mountain hare alleles among allopatric brown hares suggest that hybridization is driven by stochastic processes. Interspecific geneflow with the brown hare is unlikely to have major impacts on mountain hare in Fennoscandia, but direct competition may."
https://openalex.org/W2792240558,"As part of a major project to investigate protective and diagnostic immune markers against tuberculosis (TB), we measured antibody isotype responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigens (LAM, Rv2031, and HBHA) in cohorts of 149 pulmonary tuberculosis patients (PTBP), 148 household contacts (HHCs), and 68 community controls (CCs) in an endemic setting. ELISA was used to measure levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM from sera of cohorts at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months from entry. The results show that there were significant differences in IgA, IgG, and IgM responses to the different antigens and in the three cohorts. At baseline, the level of IgM against RV2031 and LAM did not vary between cohorts, but the levels of IgA and IgG against Rv2031 were significantly higher in PTB patients than HHCs and CCs, followed by HHCs, and the lowest in CCs. In patients, there was a significant variation in antibody responses before and after chemotherapy. The levels of IgA and IgG against HBHA, and IgA against Rv2031 decreased significantly and remained low, while IgA and IgG against LAM increased significantly and remained high following chemotherapy. However, the levels of IgM against Rv2031 and LAM increased at 6 months but decreased again at 12 months. IgM against HBHA did not show any significant variation before and after chemotherapy. Similarly, there were also significant variations in antibody responses in HHCs over time. Our results show that there are significant variations in IgA, IgG and IgM responses to the different antigens and in the three cohorts, implying that not all antibody isotype responses are markers of clinical TB. In addition, the current and previous studies consistently show that IgA and IgG against Rv2031 discriminate between clinical disease, Mtb-infected and non-infected individuals."

The effects of maternal obesity on maternal metabolism and low-grade inflammation during pregnancy, as well as offspring growth, metabolism, low-grade inflammation, testicular maturation and osteochondrotic lesions until 18 months of age were investigated. Material and methods Twenty-four mares were used and separated into two groups at insemination according to body condition score (BCS): Normal (N, n = 10, BCS ≤4) and Obese (O, n = 14, BCS ≥4.25). BCS and plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride, urea, non-esterified fatty acid, serum amyloid A (SAA), leptin and adiponectin concentrations were monitored throughout gestation. At 300 days of gestation, a Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test (FSIGT) was performed. After parturition, foals’ weight and size were monitored until 18 months of age with plasma SAA, leptin, adiponectin, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and cortisol concentrations measured at regular intervals. At 6, 12 and 18 months of age, FSIGT and osteoarticular examinations were performed. Males were gelded at one year and expression of genes involved in testicular maturation analysed by RT-qPCR. Results Throughout the experiment, maternal BCS was higher in O versus N mares. During gestation, plasma urea and adiponectin were decreased and SAA and leptin increased in O versus N mares. O mares were also more insulin resistant than N mares with a higher glucose effectiveness. Postnatally, there was no difference in offspring growth between groups. Nevertheless, plasma SAA concentrations were increased in O versus N foals until 6 months, with O foals being consistently more insulin resistant with a higher glucose effectiveness. At 12 months of age, O foals were significantly more affected by osteochondrosis than N foals. All other parameters were not different between groups. Conclusion In conclusion, maternal obesity altered metabolism and increased low-grade inflammation in both dams and foals. The risk of developing osteochondrosis at 12 months of age was also higher in foals born to obese dams."

All patients underwent PPV with 20% sulfur hexafluoride gas tamponade and were divided into two groups: the groups that did and did not maintain a prone position postoperatively. All patients were followed for more than 3 months. The main outcome measures were the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), retinal reattachment rate, and postoperative complications.Sixty-five eyes were included in the prone position group and 77 eyes in the group without prone positioning; the respective initial reattachment rates were 83.1% and 96.1%, a difference that reach significance (p = 0.011). In the eyes with inferior breaks, the initial reattachment rate was 94.7% (18 eyes) without prone positioning, which was significantly (p = 0.036) better than the 60% (6 eyes) initial reattachment rate in the group with prone positioning. In the eyes without inferior breaks, there was no significant difference in the initial reattachment rates between the two groups. The BCVAs at the 3-month postoperative visit did not differ significantly between the two groups. An epiretinal membrane (ERM) was observed postoperatively in 10 (13.0%) eyes in the group without prone positioning; no ERMs were seen postoperatively in eyes in which the internal limiting membrane (ILM) was peeled during PPV.PPV without postoperative prone positioning is associated with a higher reattachment rate in eyes with a RRD, especially those with inferior retinal breaks. PPV with postoperative supine and lateral positioning might be beneficial to manage RRDs associated with inferior retinal breaks if ILM peeling is performed intraoperatively."
https://openalex.org/W2791416078,"Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is an excellent source of vegetable oil for biodiesel production; however, there are still some limitations for its cultivation in Brazil such as Fatal Yellowing (FY) disease. FY has been studied for many years, but its causal agent has never been determined. In Colombia and nearby countries, it was reported that the causal agent of Fatal Yellowing (Pudrición del Cogollo) is the oomycete Phytophthora palmivora, however, several authors claim that Fatal Yellowing and Pudrición del Cogollo (PC) are different diseases. The major aims of this work were to test, using molecular biology tools, Brazilian oil palm trees for the co-occurrence of the oomycete Phytophthora and FY symptoms, and to characterize the fungal diversity in FY diseased and healthy leaves by next generation sequencing. Investigation with specific primers for the genus Phytophthora showed amplification in only one of the samples. Analysis of the fungal ITS region demonstrated that, at the genus level, different groups predominated in all symptomatic samples, while Pyrenochaetopsis and unclassified fungi predominated in all asymptomatic samples. Our results show that fungal communities were not the same between samples at the same stage of the disease or among all the symptomatic samples. This is the first study that describes the evolution of the microbial community in the course of plant disease and also the first work to use high throughput next generation sequencing to evaluate the fungal community associated with leaves of oil palm trees with and without symptoms of FY."

https://openalex.org/W2791936518,"Nematostella vectensis is a member of the phylum Cnidaria, a lineage that includes anemones, corals, hydras, and jellyfishes. This estuarine anemone is an excellent model system for investigating the evolution of stress tolerance because it is easy to collect in its natural habitat and to culture in the laboratory, and it has a sequenced genome. Additionally, there is evidence of local adaptation to environmental stress in different N. vectensis populations, and abundant protein-coding polymorphisms have been identified, including polymorphisms in proteins that are implicated in stress responses. N. vectensis can tolerate a wide range of environmental parameters, and has recently been shown to have substantial intraspecific variation in temperature preference. We investigated whether different clonal lines of anemones also exhibit differential tolerance to oxidative stress. N. vectensis populations are continually exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during cellular metabolism and by other environmental factors. Fifteen clonal lines of N. vectensis collected from four different estuaries were exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Pronounced differences in survival and regeneration were apparent between clonal lines collected from Meadowlands, NJ, Baruch, SC, and Kingsport, NS, as well as among 12 clonal lines collected from a single Cape Cod marsh. To our knowledge, this is the first example of intraspecific variability in oxidative stress resistance in cnidarians or in any marine animal. As oxidative stress often accompanies heat stress in marine organisms, resistance to oxidative stress could strongly influence survival in warming oceans. For example, while elevated temperatures trigger bleaching in corals, oxidative stress is thought to be the proximal trigger of bleaching at the cellular level."
https://openalex.org/W2784937745,"Mitochondrial cytochromes P450 (P450s) are responsible for important metabolic reactions, including steps involved in steroid and vitamin D metabolism. The mitochondrial P450 24A1 (CYP24A1) is responsible for deactivation of the bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3. Its function relies on formation of a P450–redox partner complex with the ferredoxin and electron donor adrenodoxin (Adx). However, very little is known about how the Adx–CYP24A1 complex forms. In this study, we report the results of solution NMR in which we monitor isotopically labeled full-length Adx as it binds CYP24A1 in complex with the P450 inhibitor clotrimazole. The NMR titration data suggested a mode for P450–Adx interactions in which formation of the complex relies on contributions from multiple recognition sites on the Adx core domain, some of which have not previously been reported. To evaluate differences among CYP24A1–Adx complexes from different mammalian species and displaying distinct regioselectivity for 1,25(OH)2D3, all bound spectra were acquired in parallel for human (carbon-23 and -24 hydroxylase), rat (carbon-24 hydroxylase), and opossum (carbon-23 hydroxylase) CYP24A1 isoforms. Binding data from a series of single and double charge–neutralizing substitutions of Adx confirmed that species-specific CYP24A1 isoforms differ in binding to Adx, providing evidence that variations in redox partner interactions correlate with P450 regioselectivity. In summary, these findings reveal that CYP24A1–Adx interactions rely on several recognition sites and that variations in CYP24A1 isoforms modulate formation of the complex, thus providing insight into the variable and complex nature of mitochondrial P450–Adx interactions."

NaVs are also found in bacteria and are members of a larger family of tetrameric voltage-gated channels that includes CaVs, KVs, and NaVs. Prokaryotic NaVs likely emerged from a homotetrameric Ca2+-selective voltage-gated progenerator, and later developed Na+ selectivity independently.

The underlying stoichiometry, putative interacting surfaces, and mechanisms of β-subunit modulation of NaVs remains poorly understood.

Among these bacterial sodium channels, NaChBac was first isolated from an alkaliphilic bacterium Bacillus halodurans and has been shown to be sodium selective and gated by voltage (59Ren D. Navarro B. Xu H. Yue L. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. A prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel.Science. 2001; 294 (11743207): 2372-237510.1126/science.1065635Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Structural studies of bacterial NaVs (bNaVs) indicate they are surprisingly similar to eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels, with a “domain-swapped” architecture of four voltage-sensing domains, which surround a central, gated pore (60Ahern C.A. Payandeh J. Bosmans F. Chanda B. The hitchhiker's guide to the voltage-gated sodium channel galaxy.J. Gen. Physiol. 2016; 147 (26712848): 1-2410.1085/jgp.201511492Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, bNaVs are phylogenetically related to eukaryotic NaVs (eNaVs) and CaV, but represent a distinct evolutionary lineage. Specifically, bNaVs are the result of an early differentiation from bacterial KVs that likely occurred before the emergence of eukaryotes, whereas eNaVs appeared more recently. Notably, bNaVs are characterized by a homotetrameric quaternary structure, in contrast to the pseudotetrameric single polypeptide eNaV. The functional and structural relationships between prokaryotic and eukaryotic channel types are not fully known. For instance, whereas eNaVs and bNaVs are both sodium selective, the mechanisms are markedly different (61Finol-Urdaneta R.K. Wang Y. Al-Sabi A. Zhao C. Noskov S.Y. French R.J. Sodium channel selectivity and conduction: prokaryotes have devised their own molecular strategy.J. Gen.

On the other hand, bNaVs show a pharmacological profile similar to that of the eNaV family, an observation that suggests that the channels of these two phyla might share structural similarities that support mechanisms of activation and inactivation (63Lee S.

LRRC55 protein is also the only γ subunit of BK channels that is expressed in mammalian nervous system. However, the expression pattern of LRRC55 gene in adult mammalian brain remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the distribution of LRRC55 mRNA in the adult mouse brain by using in situ hybridization. We found that LRRC55 mRNA is richly expressed in the adult mouse medial habenula nucleus (MHb), cerebellum and pons. However, the potential role of LRRC55 in MHb and cerebellum could be different based on the function of BK channels in these brain regions."

https://openalex.org/W2793860820,"A better understanding of the link between cellular metabolism and tumorigenesis is needed. Here, we report characterization of a novel protein named coiled-coil helix tumor and metabolism 1 (CHTM1). We have found that CHTM1 is associated with cancer and cellular metabolism. CHTM1 localizes to mitochondria and cytosol, and its deficiency in cancer cells results in decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP levels as well as oxidative stress indicating mitochondrial dysfunction. CHTM1-deficient cancer cells display poor growth under glucose/glutamine-deprived conditions, whereas cells expressing increased levels of exogenous CHTM1 exhibit enhanced proliferation and survival under similar conditions. CHTM1 deficiency also leads to defects in lipid metabolism resulting in fatty acid accumulation, which explains poor growth of CHTM1-deficient cells under glucose/glutamine deprivation since nutrient deprivation increases dependency on lipids for energy generation. We also demonstrate that CHTM1 mediates its effect via the PKC, CREB, and PGC-1alpha signaling axis, and cytosolic accumulation of CHTM1 during nutrient deprivation appears to be important for its effect on cellular signaling events. Furthermore, analyses of tissue specimens from 71 breast and 97 colon cancer patients show CHTM1 expression to be upregulated in the majority of tumor specimens representing these malignancies. Collectively, our findings are highly significant because CHTM1 is a novel metabolic marker that is important for the growth of tumorigenic cells under limiting nutrient supplies and thus, links cellular metabolism and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2792162272,"The shape diameter function (SDF) is a scalar function defined on a closed manifold surface, measuring the neighborhood diameter of the object at each point. Due to its pose oblivious property, SDF is widely used in shape analysis, segmentation and retrieval. However, computing SDF is computationally expensive since one has to place an inverted cone at each point and then average the penetration distances for a number of rays inside the cone. Furthermore, the shape diameters are highly sensitive to local geometric features as well as the normal vectors, hence diminishing their applications to real-world meshes which often contain rich geometric details and/or various types of defects, such as noise and gaps. In order to increase the robustness of SDF and promote it to a wide range of 3D models, we define SDF by offsetting the input object a little bit. This seemingly minor change brings three significant benefits: First, it allows us to compute SDF in a robust manner since the offset surface is able to give reliable normal vectors. Second, it runs many times faster since at each point we only need to compute the penetration distance along a single direction, rather than tens of directions. Third, our method does not require watertight surfaces as the input—it supports both point clouds and meshes with noise and gaps. Extensive experimental results show that the offset-surface based SDF is robust to noise and insensitive to geometric details, and it also runs about 10 times faster than the existing method. We also exhibit its usefulness using two typical applications including shape retrieval and shape segmentation, and observe a significant improvement over the existing SDF."
https://openalex.org/W2784610445,"Next week, physicists will pick up an old quest for new physics. A team of 190 researchers at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois, will begin measuring the magnetism of a fleeting particle called the muon to exquisite precision, in an experiment known as Muon g-2 (pronounced gee minus two). They hope to firm up tantalizing hints from an earlier incarnation of the experiment that suggested that the particle is ever so slightly more magnetic than predicted by the prevailing standard model of particle physics. That would give researchers something they have desired for decades: proof of physics beyond the standard model. From 1997 to 2001, researchers on the original g-2 experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, saw tantalizing, but inconclusive signs of an excess in the muon magnetism. In 2013, the team lugged the experiment to Fermilab, taking the 28-meter-wide ring by barge around the U.S. eastern seaboard and up the Mississippi River. Now, they have rebuilt, and over the next 3 years they hope to push it to its limits—and perhaps a thrilling new discovery."
