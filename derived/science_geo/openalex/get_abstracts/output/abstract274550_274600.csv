https://openalex.org/W2156765447,"The surface reflectivity of Venus obtained by radar interferometry at a wavelength of 3.8 centimeters has been mapped for a region extending approximately from -80 degrees to 0 degrees in longitude (Carpenter's definition) and from -50 degrees to +40 degrees in latitude. The map is free from the twofold range-Doppler ambiguity because the interferometer fringe pattern makes possible the separation of two points of equal range and Doppler shift. The map presents many new features and clearly delineates features already observed. Most notably, the map shows large circular regions of significantly lower reflectivity than their surroundinigs."

Crystalline inclusions (up to 3 percent) occur in the pores of the crystallites and consist mainly of orthoclase and small amounts of other igneous, metamorphic, and secondary minerals."
https://openalex.org/W2066693933,Observations of the infrared absorption bands attributed to the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups in biotite containing predominantly ferrous iron show that the dipole moments of the hydroxyls associated with ferrous iron are oriented perpendicular to the cleavage plane of the lattice. Oxidation in the biotite from ferrous iron to ferric iron results in the disappearance of the infrared absorption bands due to the hydroxyls associated with ferrous iron. The dipole moments of the hydroxyls associated with ferric iron in the oxidized biotite have been shown to be in an inclined position with respect to the cleavage plae. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis of Barshad and Kishk regarding the effect of oxidation on the replaceability of interlayer potassium ions in biotite by ammonium ions.

carried by Mariner 6 were recently
reported (1). This is a similar
report of the television experiment
aboard Mariner 7. These reports are
presented primarily to communicate
significant results to the scientific community
as rapidly as possible. A more
comprehensive, but still preliminary,
review of the results of both experiments,
and of their implications concerning
the atmosphere and surface of
Mars, is in preparation for submission
to this journal."

https://openalex.org/W2074141358,"Organic sediments beneath historic Lafayette Park mark the site of a freshwater marsh which bordered the Potomac River when it was 15 meters above its present level. Plant microfossils and ice-rafted boulders indicate a climate much colder than now. The carbon-14 age of more than 45,000 years and palynological studies suggest an early Wisconsin age."

https://openalex.org/W2038860412,"Preferred orientation was observed in certain undeformed dolomites with a microphotometric technique. The preferred direction of the c-axis was found to be perpendicular to the bedding planes. The degree of orientation is rather slight, but is considered significant due to the fact that thousands of crystals are included in each measurement. It is suggested that the preferred orientation was acquired during an early diagenetic stage of dolomitization, when the individual crystals could rotate and adjust their position so that their maximum cross section tended to lie horizontally."
