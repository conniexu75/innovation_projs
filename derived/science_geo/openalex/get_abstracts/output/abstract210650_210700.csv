https://openalex.org/W2057294867,"INVESTIGATIONS by several authors1,2 have demonstrated that paramagnetic metal ions produce a certain amount of resistance to radiation in cells. This fact is due partly to the redox effect of these ions3, and partly to the facilitation of forbidden transitions of excited electron states4. Since different nucleic acids contain trace elements in significant amounts5, and since the biological activity of nucleic acids is dependent to a large extent on their trace-element content6–8, it seemed essential to us to investigate the trace-element content of those most important macro-molecules of the cell before and after irradiation. It was also shown that by roentgen irradiation removal of Ca++ and Mg++ from nucleohistone is possible, whereby at the same time reduction in DNA occurs9."

https://openalex.org/W1966184152,"SIGNIFICANT changes in electroretinograms (ERG) and in spontaneous electrical activity recorded from the compound eyes of cockroaches have been found here during investigations of the effects of radiation on insects. These electrical discharges, although similar to the activity recorded from the optic nerve of Limulus1, do not exhibit as marked a change in frequency with light stimulation. In this communication, we present the results of preliminary studies of the effects of X-rays on both the ERG and the spontaneous electrical discharges in the eye of the cockroach B. giganteus."

https://openalex.org/W1981123926,"THE gene responsible for transferrin C seems to be very common in all human populations. Of the rare alleles, those producing the faster-moving variants have mainly been found in Caucasoids. The most common of them is B2, which has been observed in 1 per cent of Canadian Whites, Englishmen and Swedes1–3. Tf B1 has been reported in 1 of 139 British Whites2 and 2 of 1,173 Swedes3."

Their distribution in the organs of the ticks has been, in the past, studied by various investigators3,4 from conventionally stained smears and sections of tick tissues."
