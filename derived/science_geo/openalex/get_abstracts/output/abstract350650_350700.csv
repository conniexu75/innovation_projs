https://openalex.org/W2064170412,"Oxidative damage and inflammation are postulated to be involved in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, the molecular signal(s) linking oxidation to inflammation in this late-onset disease is unknown. Here we describe AMD-like lesions in mice after immunization with mouse serum albumin adducted with carboxyethylpyrrole, a unique oxidation fragment of docosahexaenoic acid that has previously been found adducting proteins in drusen from AMD donor eye tissues and in plasma samples from individuals with AMD. Immunized mice develop antibodies to this hapten, fix complement component-3 in Bruch's membrane, accumulate drusen below the retinal pigment epithelium during aging, and develop lesions in the retinal pigment epithelium mimicking geographic atrophy, the blinding end-stage condition characteristic of the dry form of AMD. We hypothesize that these mice are sensitized to the generation of carboxyethylpyrrole adducts in the outer retina, where docosahexaenoic acid is abundant and conditions for oxidative damage are permissive. This new model provides a platform for dissecting the molecular pathology of oxidative damage in the outer retina and the immune response contributing to AMD."

https://openalex.org/W2127688908,"The statistical methods applied to the analysis of genomic data do not account for uncertainty in the sequence alignment. Indeed, the alignment is treated as an observation, and all of the subsequent inferences depend on the alignment being correct. This may not have been too problematic for many phylogenetic studies, in which the gene is carefully chosen for, among other things, ease of alignment. However, in a comparative genomics study, the same statistical methods are applied repeatedly on thousands of genes, many of which will be difficult to align. Using genomic data from seven yeast species, we show that uncertainty in the alignment can lead to several problems, including different alignment methods resulting in different conclusions."

https://openalex.org/W1987315263,"The propagation of information through signaling cascades spans a wide range of time scales, including the rapid ligand-receptor interaction and the much slower response of downstream gene expression. To determine which dynamic range dominates a response, we used periodic stimuli to measure the frequency dependence of signal transduction in the osmo-adaptation pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We applied system identification methods to infer a concise predictive model. We found that the dynamics of the osmo-adaptation response are dominated by a fast-acting negative feedback through the kinase Hog1 that does not require protein synthesis. After large osmotic shocks, an additional, much slower, negative feedback through gene expression allows cells to respond faster to future stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2158213282,"The proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BAD resides in a glucokinase-containing complex that regulates glucose-driven mitochondrial respiration. Here, we present genetic evidence of a physiologic role for BAD in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by beta cells. This novel function of BAD is specifically dependent upon the phosphorylation of its BH3 sequence, previously defined as an essential death domain. We highlight the pharmacologic relevance of phosphorylated BAD BH3 by using cell-permeable, hydrocarbon-stapled BAD BH3 helices that target glucokinase, restore glucose-driven mitochondrial respiration and correct the insulin secretory response in Bad-deficient islets. Our studies uncover an alternative target and function for the BAD BH3 domain and emphasize the therapeutic potential of phosphorylated BAD BH3 mimetics in selectively restoring beta cell function. Furthermore, we show that BAD regulates the physiologic adaptation of beta cell mass during high-fat feeding. Our findings provide genetic proof of the bifunctional activities of BAD in both beta cell survival and insulin secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2020970511,"Many amyloid inhibitors resemble molecules that form chemical aggregates, which are known to inhibit many proteins. Eight known chemical aggregators inhibited amyloid formation of the yeast and mouse prion proteins Sup35 and recMoPrP in a manner characteristic of colloidal inhibition. Similarly, three known anti-amyloid molecules inhibited Î²-lactamase in a detergent-dependent manner, which suggests that they too form colloidal aggregates. The colloids localized to preformed fibers and prevented new fiber formation in electron micrographs. They also blocked infection of yeast cells with Sup35 prions, which suggests that colloidal inhibition may be relevant in more biological milieus."
https://openalex.org/W2000742564,"Brd4 is a bromodomain protein that binds to acetylated chromatin. It regulates cell growth, although the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Brd4 has also been shown to control transcription of viral genes, whereas its role in transcription of cellular genes has not been fully elucidated. Here we addressed the role of Brd4 in cell growth and transcription using a small hairpin (sh) RNA approach. The Brd4 shRNA vector stably knocked down Brd4 protein expression by approximately 90% in NIH3T3 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Brd4 knockdown cells were growth impaired and grew more slowly than control cells. When synchronized by serum starvation and released, Brd4 knockdown cells were arrested at G(1), whereas control cells progressed to S phase. In microarray analysis, although numerous genes were up-regulated during G(1) in control cells, many of these G(1) genes were not up-regulated in Brd4 knockdown cells. Reintroduction of Brd4 rescued expression of these G(1) genes in Brd4 knockdown cells, allowing cells to progress toward S phase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that Brd4 was recruited to the promoters of these G(1) genes during G(0)-G(1) progression. Furthermore, Brd4 recruitment coincided with increased binding of Cdk9, a component of P-TEFb and RNA polymerase II to these genes. Brd4 recruitment was low to absent at genes not affected by Brd4 shRNA. The results indicate that Brd4 stimulates G(1) gene expression by binding to multiple G(1) gene promoters in a cell cycle-dependent manner."

https://openalex.org/W1981444242,"Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a homodimeric prototype of the galectins with a single carbohydrate-recognition domain, was recently identified as being overexpressed in tumor-associated capillary endothelial cells. The role of Gal-1 in endothelial cellular functions and the mechanism of action of Gal-1 remain unknown. Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a neuronal receptor that mediates repulsive growth cone guidance, and NRP1 functions in endothelial cells as a coreceptor (with vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs)) for VEGF(165). In this study, we found that Gal-1 was overexpressed in the tumor-associated endothelial cells of oral squamous cell carcinomas (P<0.001). Gal-1 increased the proliferation and adhesion of endothelial cells, and enhanced cell migration in combination with VEGF(165). Surprisingly, Gal-1 selectively bound NRP1 via the carbohydrate-recognition domain, but did not bind VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3. The Gal-1-NRP1 interaction mediated the migration and adhesion of endothelial cells. The binding of Gal-1 to NRP1 enhanced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and stimulated the activation of the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases SAPK1/JNK (stress activated protein kinase-1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase). These findings show, for the first time, that Gal-1 can directly bind to NRP1 on endothelial cells, and can promote the NRP1/VEGFR-2-mediated signaling pathway as well as NRP1-mediated biological activities."
https://openalex.org/W2147749026,"Many lines of evidence indicate that GABA and GABAA receptors make important contributions to human sleep regulation. Pharmacological manipulation of these receptors has differential effects on sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia. Here we show that sleep is regulated by GABA in Drosophila and that a mutant GABAA receptor, RdlA302S, specifically decreases sleep latency. The drug carbamazepine (CBZ) has the opposite effect on sleep; it increases sleep latency as well as decreasing sleep. Behavioral and physiological experiments indicated that RdlA302S mutant flies are resistant to the effects of CBZ on sleep latency and that mutant RDLA302S channels are resistant to the effects of CBZ on desensitization, respectively. These results suggest that this biophysical property of the channel, specifically channel desensitization, underlies the regulation of sleep latency in flies. These experiments uncouple the regulation of sleep latency from that of sleep duration and suggest that the kinetics of GABAA receptor signaling dictate sleep latency."
https://openalex.org/W2055814913,"The chromosome passenger complex (CPC) controls chromosome congression, kinetochore-microtubule attachments, and spindle checkpoint signaling during mitosis. Aurora-B kinase is the catalytic subunit of the CPC. To understand how a single kinase can regulate such diverse events, we have investigated the activation of Aurora-B and describe two distinct activation mechanisms. First, Aurora-B activation in vitro requires two cofactors, telophase disc-60kD (TD-60) and microtubules. TD-60 is critical to localize both the CPC and Haspin kinase activity to centromeres and thus regulates Aurora-B at several levels. Second, Aurora-B substrates can inhibit kinase activation, and this is relieved by phosphorylation of these substrates by the centromeric kinases Plk1 and Haspin. These regulatory mechanisms suggest models for phosphorylation by Aurora-B of centromeric substrates at unaligned chromosomes and merotelic attachments."

https://openalex.org/W2071746963,"The expression level of the telomerase catalytic subunit (telomerase reverse transcriptase, TERT) positively correlates with cell survival after exposure to several lethal stresses. However, whether the protective role of TERT is independent of telomerase activity has not yet been clearly explored. Here, we genetically evaluated the protective roles of both TERT and telomerase activity against cell death induced by staurosporine (STS) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). First generation (G1) TERT-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) displayed an increased sensitivity to STS, while TERT transgenic MEFs were more resistant to STS-induced apoptosis than wild-type. Deletion of the telomerase RNA component (TERC) failed to alter the sensitivity of TERT transgenic MEFs to STS treatment. Similarly, NMDA-induced excitotoxic cell death of primary neurons was suppressed by TERT, but not by TERC both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, NMDA accelerated death of TERT-deficient mice, while TERT transgenic mice showed enhanced survival when compared with wild-type littermates after administration of NMDA. In addition, the transgenic expression of TERT protected motor neurons from apoptosis induced by sciatic nerve axotomy. These results indicate that telomerase activity is not essential for the protective function of TERT. This telomerase activity-independent TERT function may contribute to cancer development and aging independently of telomere lengthening."
https://openalex.org/W2152739288,"This study aimed to identify signaling pathways that oppose connective tissue fibrosis in the aortic valve. Using valvular interstitial cells (VICs) isolated from porcine aortic valve leaflets, we show that basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) effectively blocks transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-mediated myofibroblast activation. FGF-2 prevents the induction of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) expression and the exit of VICs from the cell cycle, both of which are hallmarks of myofibroblast activation. By blocking the activity of the Smad transcription factors that serve as the downstream nuclear effectors of TGF-beta1, FGF-2 treatment inhibits fibrosis in VICs. Using an exogenous Smad-responsive transcriptional promoter reporter, we show that Smad activity is repressed by FGF-2, likely an effect of the fact that FGF-2 treatment prevents the nuclear localization of Smads in these cells. This appears to be a direct effect of FGF signaling through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades as the treatment of VICs with the MAPK/extracellular regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 acted to induce fibrosis and blocked the ability of FGF-2 to inhibit TGF-beta1 signaling. Furthermore, FGF-2 treatment of VICs blocks the development of pathological contractile and calcifying phenotypes, suggesting that these pathways may be utilized in the engineering of effective treatments for valvular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2106890990,"The familial cylindromatosis tumor suppressor CYLD is known to contain three cytoskeleton-associated protein glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domains, which exist in a number of microtubule-binding proteins and are responsible for their association with microtubules. However, it remains elusive whether CYLD interacts with microtubules and, if so, whether the interaction is mediated by the CAP-Gly domains. In this study, our data demonstrate that CYLD associates with microtubules both in cells and in vitro, and the first CAP-Gly domain of CYLD is mainly responsible for the interaction. Knockdown of cellular CYLD expression dramatically delays microtubule regrowth after nocodazole washout, indicating an activity for CYLD in promoting microtubule assembly.

Thus CYLD joins a growing list of CAP-Gly domain-containing proteins that regulate microtubule dynamics and function. The microtubule cytoskeleton plays a critical role in many cell activities, such as cell shaping, intracellular trafficking, cell division, and cell motility. The structure and function of microtubules are regulated exquisitely in cells by a repertoire of microtubule-binding proteins, including proteins that regulate the assembly and organization of microtubules and motor proteins that mediate the transport of organelles and vesicles (1Amos L.A. Schlieper D. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 257-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These proteins bind microtubules either at the microtubule ends or on the outside of the microtubule wall or bind to soluble tubulin. Different structural motifs present in the microtubule-binding proteins are responsible for their interaction with microtubules. For example, the microtubule end-binding protein EB1 interacts with microtubules through the calponin homology domain (2Hayashi I. Ikura M. J. Biol.

This domain has been identified in a wide range of microtubule-binding proteins apart from CLIP-170 and p150glued, such as the motor protein kinesin-73, the CLIP-170-like protein BIK1, and the tubulin folding cofactors B and E (5Guasch A.

A common function for the CAP-Gly domains in the CAP-Gly proteins is to mediate their colocalization and association with microtubules. A growing body of evidence suggests that the CAP-Gly domains themselves are responsible for binding to microtubules (8Pierre P. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. J.

Several other functions for CYLD have been proposed recently, such as the regulation of cellular entry into mitosis (16Stegmeier F. Sowa M.E. Nalepa G. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8869-8874Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), although the precise molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated.CYLD is the first protein reported to have three CAP-Gly domains, whereas most other CAP-Gly proteins have only one or two. The first and third CAP-Gly domains of CYLD are quite similar to the previously reported CAP-Gly domains in the amino acid sequence, whereas the second CAP-Gly domain shows weaker similarity (11Bignell G.R. Warren W. Seal S. Takahashi M. Rapley E. Barfoot R. Green H. Brown C. Biggs P.J. Lakhani S.R. Jones C. Hansen J. Blair E. Hofmann B. Siebert R. Turner G. Evans D.G. Schrander-Stumpel C.

It was found recently that ectopically expressed CYLD colocalizes with microtubules in cells (16Stegmeier F. Sowa M.E. Nalepa G. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8869-8874Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether CYLD indeed interacts with microtubules like other CAP-Gly proteins and, if so, whether the interaction is mediated by the CAP-Gly domains. In addition, it is unclear whether CYLD plays a role in regulating microtubule dynamics or microtubule-mediated cellular events as other CAP-Gly proteins do. In this study, we show that CYLD binds microtubules primarily through its first CAP-Gly domain, regulates microtubule dynamics, and is important for cell migration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsâNocodazole, 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and antibodies against FLAG, Î±-tubulin, acetylated Î±-tubulin, and Î²-actin were purchased from Sigma. The antibody against detyrosinated Î±-tubulin was from Abcam, and the antibody against CYLD was generated by immunization of mice with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing amino acids 1â555 of human CYLD. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories.Cell Culture and TransfectionâHeLa and CV1 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in RPMI 1640 medium were cultured in the indicated media supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 Â°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Plasmid transfection was performed using the polyethyleneimine reagent (Sigma). CYLD and enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized by Ribobio (Guangzhou, China) and transfected into cells with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen).Plasmids and ProteinsâThe pEGFPC1-CYLD and pcDNA3-FLAG-CYLD plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. George Mosialos (A. Fleming Biomedical Sciences Research Center, Vari, Greece). The plasmids pEGFPC1-CYLDsm and pEGFPC1-CYLDsmÎCG1 (deletion of amino acids 115â209) encode silent mutants that are not targeted by CYLD siRNA and were generated by PCR. The bacterial expression plasmids for GST-tagged full-length or truncated forms of CYLD were constructed by insertion of the cDNA fragments into the pGEX6P3 vector. The BL21 (DE3) strain of Escherichia coli was used to express GST-CYLD fusion proteins or GST alone, and proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). In vitro transcription and translation of CYLD were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) following the accompanying protocol. Bovine brain tubulin (microtubule-associated protein-free, >99% pure) was obtained from Cytoskeleton Inc.Immunofluorescence MicroscopyâCells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with methanol for 5 min at â20 Â°C or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. Cells were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated in succession with primary and fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by staining with 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min. Coverslips were mounted with 90% glycerol in PBS and examined with an Olympus fluorescence microscope.Western BlottingâProteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) as described previously (17Liu M. Aneja R. Liu C. Sun L. Gao J. Wang H. Dong J.T. Sarli V. Giannis A. Joshi H.C. Zhou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18090-18097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% fat-free dry milk and incubated first with primary antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Specific proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce).Immunoprecipitation and GST PulldownâFor immunoprecipitation, cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-CYLD or the empty vector. The cell lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose beads at 4 Â°C for 2 h. Alternatively, the cell lysate was incubated with anti-Î±-tubulin antibody at 4 Â°C for 2 h, and protein A-agarose beads were then added to incubate for another 3 h. The beads were washed extensively and boiled in SDS loading buffer, and the precipitated proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For GST pulldown in vitro, GST or GST-CYLD fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with purified tubulin at 4 Â°C for 2 h. The beads were washed extensively, and the proteins were analyzed by Western blotting.Microtubule Cosedimentation AssaysâTo examine CYLD-microtubule interaction in vivo, cells were homogenized, added to 100 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, and centrifuged at 4 Â°C for 1 h at 50,000 rpm. The supernatant was added to 20 Î¼m paclitaxel and 1 mm GTP, incubated at 37 Â°C for 5 min, and then placed on ice for 15 min. The mixture was loaded over the PEMG buffer (100 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm GTP, pH 6.8) containing 15% sucrose and 20 Î¼m paclitaxel and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 rpm. The pellet (containing microtubules and associated proteins) and supernatant fractions were then collected individually, and the proteins present in each fraction were examined by Western blotting. To examine CYLD-microtubule interaction in vitro, microtubules were assembled from bovine brain tubulin at 30 Â°C in the presence of 1 mm GTP and 20 Î¼m paclitaxel. The reaction mixture was layered over PEMG buffer containing 50% sucrose and 20 Î¼m paclitaxel and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 rpm. The pellet and supernatant fractions were then collected and analyzed by Western blotting.Microtubule Depolymerization/RegrowthâThe microtubule regrowth experiment was performed as described previously (18Ezratty E.J. Partridge M.A. Gundersen G.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were treated with 5 Î¼m nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules, and the drug was then washed out and microtubules were allowed to regrow. To visualize microtubules with immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and stained with anti-Î±-tubulin antibody. To examine tubulin partitioning between the polymer and soluble dimer by Western blotting, cellular soluble proteins were extracted with PEMG buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 4 m glycerol. The remaining polymeric (cytoskeletal) fraction was dissolved in 0.5% SDS in 25 mm Tris, pH 6.8.Tubulin Turbidity AssayâSpectrophotometer cuvettes held a solution consisting of PEMG buffer and in vitro translated CYLD. The cuvettes were kept at room temperature before the addition of purified tubulin and shifted to 37 Â°C in a temperature-controlled spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). The assembly was monitored by measuring the changes in absorbance (350 nm) as described previously (19Xuan C. Qiao W. Gao J. Liu M. Zhang X. Cao Y. Chen Q. Geng Y. Zhou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28800-28806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of CYLD on microtubule stability, microtubules were assembled from tubulin in the presence or absence of CYLD. The reactions were diluted 1:1 by addition of PEMG buffer, and the temperature was then shifted to 4 Â°C. Microtubule disassembly upon dilution and cooling was examined by measuring the absorbance at 350-nm wavelength.Wound Healing AssayâHUVEC grown in 24-well plates as confluent monolayers were mechanically scratched using a 20-Î¼l pipette tip to create the wound. Cells were washed with PBS to remove the debris, and complete culture media were then added to allow wound healing. Phase-contrast images of the wound were taken at three random locations, first immediately after wounding and then at the same location after 24 h, to examine wound closure by migrating cells. Cells that migrated into the wound area were then counted.RESULTSCYLD Interacts with Microtubules Both in Cells and in VitroâTo investigate whether CYLD interacts with microtubules, we first assessed the subcellular localization of ectopically expressed CYLD tagged with GFP. In agreement with the previous data (16Stegmeier F. Sowa M.E. Nalepa G. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8869-8874Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we found that the GFP-CYLD fusion protein colocalized with microtubules in both CV1 and HeLa cells (data not shown). In addition, with a CYLD-specific antibody, we found that endogenous CYLD also colocalized with the microtubule cytoskeleton in CV1 cells (Fig. 1A) and HeLa cells (data not shown).We studied CYLD-microtubule association further by microtubule cosedimentation assays. HeLa cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged CYLD, and microtubules and associated proteins were then prepared from the cell lysate, in the absence or presence of paclitaxel and GTP, and pelleted by centrifugation. As expected, microtubules (polymerized tubulin) were present in the pellet only when paclitaxel and GTP were added in the preparation procedure (Fig. 1B). FLAG-CYLD was detected in the microtubule pellet, whereas actin was not (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether CYLD interacts with microtubules in the purified system, we incubated 35S-labeled in vitro translated CYLD with microtubules assembled from 10 Î¼m tubulin and then pelleted microtubules. SDS-PAGE and autoradiography revealed that the majority of CYLD cosedimented with microtubules (Fig. 1C), suggesting a direct interaction of CYLD with microtubules in vitro. In addition, we found that the binding of CYLD to microtubules was concentration-dependent and saturable (Fig. 1D).CYLD Interacts with Tubulin Both in Cells and in VitroâWe next investigated whether CYLD interacts with the microtubule subunit tubulin. HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-CYLD, and the cell lysate was then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Western blotting of the precipitate with anti-Î±-tubulin antibody revealed that tubulin was coprecipitated with FLAG-CYLD (Fig. 2A). The interaction between tubulin and FLAG-CYLD in HeLa cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate with anti-Î±-tubulin antibody and Western blotting of the precipitate with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2B). Similarly, we found an interaction between CYLD and tubulin in CV1 cells (Fig. 2C) and 293T cells (data not shown).FIGURE 2CYLD interacts with tubulin both in cells and in vitro. A, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-CYLD or the empty vector pcDNA3. The interaction of FLAG-CYLD with cellular tubulin was analyzed by immunoprecipitation (IP) of the cell lysate with anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotting of the precipitate with anti-Î±-tubulin antibody. B, HeLa cells were transfected as in A, and the interaction between FLAG-CYLD and tubulin was examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Î±-tubulin antibody (or IgG control) and Western blotting of the precipitate with anti-FLAG antibody. C, experiments were performed as in A, except that CV1 cells were used instead of HeLa cells. D, purified bovine brain tubulin was incubated with in vitro translated CYLD, and the CYLD-tubulin interaction was examined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Î±-tubulin antibody (or IgG control), followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. E, purified tubulin was incubated with bacterially purified GST-CYLD or GST immobilized on agarose beads. GST pulldown was then performed, and the presence of tubulin in the pulldown preparation was detected by Western blotting using anti-Î±-tubulin antibody. GST-CYLD and GST used in the pulldown assay were detected by Coomassie Blue staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also examined whether CYLD interacts with tubulin in vitro. In vitro translated CYLD was incubated with purified bovine brain tubulin, and the mixture was immunoprecipitated with anti-Î±-tubulin antibody. SDS-PAGE and autoradiography detected the presence of CYLD in the precipitate (Fig. 2D), indicating an interaction between CYLD and tubulin in vitro. This result was confirmed by incubating bacterially purified GST-CYLD with bovine brain tubulin followed by GST pull-down. As shown in Fig. 2E, Western blotting with anti-Î±-tubulin antibody showed clearly the presence of tubulin in the pull-down preparation.Role of the CAP-Gly Domains in Mediating the Interaction of CYLD with Microtubules and TubulinâCAP-Gly domains are known to mediate the association of CAP-Gly proteins with microtubules. Therefore, we asked whether the CAP-Gly domains of CYLD are responsible for its interaction with microtubules. By microtubule cosedimentation assay, we found that the amino-terminal region of CYLD, which contains the three CAP-Gly domains, mainly resided in the microtubule pellet. In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal region, which contains the ubiquitin hydrolase domain, was not detectable in the pellet (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, the three CAP-Gly domains of CYLD exhibited distinct microtubule binding profiles; the first CAP-Gly domain showed much stronger binding ability than the other two (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the first CAP-Gly domain of CYLD is mainly responsible for its interaction with microtubules.FIGURE 3Role of the CAP-Gly domains in mediating the interaction of CYLD with microtubules and tubulin. A, a schematic representation of fulllength (FL) and truncated forms of CYLD is shown. The three open boxes in the amino terminus represent the three CAP-Gly domains (CG1â3), and the filled box in the carboxyl terminus represents the ubiquitin hydrolase catalytic domain. B, in vitro translated CYLD and its truncated forms were incubated without or with microtubules assembled from 10 Î¼m tubulin. Microtubules were then pelleted by centrifugation, and CYLD proteins in the pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. C, purified tubulin was incubated with bacterially purified GST or various forms of GST-CYLD immobilized on agarose beads. GST pulldown was then performed, and the presence of tubulin in the pulldown preparation was detected by Western blotting using anti-Î±-tubulin antibody. GST fusion proteins used in the pulldown assay were detected by Coomassie Blue staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined by GST pulldown assay the interaction of various forms of CYLD with tubulin. As shown in Fig. 3C, the amino-terminal region of CYLD could interact with tubulin, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region could not. In addition, we found that only the first two CAP-Gly domains of CYLD were able to interact with tubulin (Fig. 3C).Knockdown of Cellular CYLD Delays Microtubule Regrowth after Nocodazole WashoutâThe specific interaction of CYLD with microtubules and tubulin suggested that this protein might play a role in regulating the dynamic property of microtubule assembly. To test this possibility, we transfected HeLa cells with CYLD-specific siRNA and treated cells with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules. Then we examined microtubule regrowth after nocodazole washout. As shown in Fig. 4A, CYLD siRNA resulted in an apparent decrease of CYLD expression (78.6% decrease). Immunofluorescence staining of cellular microtubules showed that knockdown of CYLD expression dramatically retarded microtubule regrowth after nocodazole removal (Fig. 4B). For example, in cells transfected with control siRNA, microtubule fibers were quite evident after 5 min of regrowth. In contrast, only a few small microtubule asters were detected in CYLD siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Knockdown of cellular CYLD expression retards microtubule regrowth after nocodazole removal. A, Western blot analysis of the expression of CYLD and Î±-tubulin in HeLa cells transfected with control (enhanced GFP, siControl) or CYLD (siCYLD) siRNAs is shown. The relative level of CYLD was determined by densitometric analysis of the Western blot bands. B, immunofluorescent images of microtubules are shown. HeLa cells transfected with control or CYLD siRNAs were treated with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules. The drug was then washed out, and microtubules were allowed to regrow for the indicated times. C, HeLa cells were transfected with control or CYLD siRNAs, and microtubule depolymerization-regrowth assay was performed. Tubulin partitioning between the polymer (P) and soluble dimer (S) was then examined after 5 or 15 min of microtubule regrowth. D, experiments were performed as in C, and the ratio of tubulin polymer to soluble dimer (P/S) was measured by densitometric analysis of the Western blot bands. The values shown in this graph represent means Â± S.D. of data from three independent experiments. E, immunofluorescence images of microtubules and GFP-tagged proteins are shown. HeLa cells treated by CYLD siRNA were transfected with plasmids expressing GFP-CYLDsm or GFP-CYLDsmÎCG1 (GFP-CYLDsm and GFP-CYLDsmÎCG1 plasmids encode silent mutants that are not targeted by CYLD siRNA). Cells were treated with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules. The drug was then washed out, and microtubules were allowed to regrow for 5 min. ÎCG1, deletion of the first CAP-Gly domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess quantitatively the effect of CYLD siRNA on microtubule regrowth following nocodazole washout, we prepared cell extracts that contained cytoskeletal (polymeric) and soluble (dimeric) tubulin, respectively, after 5 or 15 min of microtubule regrowth. Consistent with the immunofluorescence staining results, Western blot analysis revealed that CYLD siRNA significantly delayed cellular tubulin polymerization into microtubules (Fig. 4C). Densitometric analysis of the Western blot bands showed a dramatic decrease in the ratio of tubulin polymer to soluble dimer following CYLD siRNA treatment (Fig. 4D).Furthermore, we found that the inhibitory effect of CYLD siRNA on microtubule regrowth could be significantly reversed by the expression of GFP-tagged CYLD (Fig. 4E). In contrast, expression of GFP-CYLD that does not contain the first CAP-Gly domain, which is mainly responsible for CYLD binding to microtubules, was not quite effective in reversing microtubule regrowth (Fig. 4E). Collectively, these data indicate a role for CYLD in promoting microtubule assembly and demonstrate the functional significance of the first CAP-Gly domain of CYLD in cells.CYLD Promotes Microtubule Assembly and Stability in VitroâWe then examined the effect of CYLD on the assembly of tubulin subunits into microtubules in vitro by measuring changes in the turbidity produced upon tubulin polymerization at 37 Â°C. As shown in Fig. 5A, CYLD could increase tubulin turbidity in a concentration-dependent manner, and in the presence of CYLD a larger extent of depolymerization was observed upon cooling the solution to 4 Â°C. These results indicate that CYLD could promote tubulin polymerization into microtubules in vitro.FIGURE 5CYLD promotes microtubule assembly and increases microtubule stability in vitro.

The open arrow refers to the time point when the temperature was shifted to 4 Â°C. B, microtubules assembled from tubulin at 37 Â°C in the presence or absence of in vitro translated CYLD. The reactions were diluted 1:1 by addition of PEMG buffer, and the temperature was then shifted to 4 Â°C.

PTX3 exerts its functions by interacting with a number of structurally unrelated molecules, a capacity that is likely to rely on its complex multimeric structure stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds. In this study, PAGE analyses performed under both native and denaturing conditions indicated that human recombinant PTX3 is mainly composed of covalently linked octamers. The network of disulfide bonds supporting this octameric assembly was resolved by mass spectrometry and Cys to Ser site-directed mutagenesis. Here we report that cysteine residues at positions 47, 49, and 103 in the N-terminal domain form three symmetric interchain disulfide bonds stabilizing four protein subunits in a tetrameric arrangement. Additional interchain disulfide bonds formed by the C-terminal domain cysteines Cys317 and Cys318 are responsible for linking the PTX3 tetramers into octamers. We also identified three intrachain disulfide bonds within the C-terminal domain that we used as structural constraints to build a new three-dimensional model for this domain. Previously it has been shown that PTX3 is a key component of the cumulus oophorus extracellular matrix, which forms around the oocyte prior to ovulation, because cumuli from PTX3-/- mice show defective matrix organization. Recombinant PTX3 is able to restore the normal phenotype ex vivo in cumuli from PTX3-/- mice. Here we demonstrate that PTX3 Cys to Ser mutants, mainly assembled into tetramers, exhibited wild type rescue activity, whereas a mutant, predominantly composed of dimers, had impaired functionality. These findings indicate that protein oligomerization is essential for PTX3 activity within the cumulus matrix and implicate PTX3 tetramers as the functional molecular units required for cumulus matrix organization and stabilization.

Emerging evidence suggests that both short and long pentraxins express distinct bioactivities depending on subunit organization. For example, native CRP inhibits platelet activation and prevents platelet capture of neutrophils, whereas monomeric CRP, resulting from loss of the pentameric symmetry of the molecule, displays potent prothrombotic activities (30Khreiss T.

Moreover disruption of the pentameric structure, as achieved by urea treatment or by site-directed mutagenesis, leads to enhanced CRP binding to C1q and subsequent C1 activation as well as the ability of CRP to interact with complement-regulatory proteins factor H and C4b-binding protein (32BiÌroÌ A.

Neuronal pentraxin 2 (NP2), also known as neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin (Narp), and neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), two members of the long pentraxin subfamily selectively expressed in brain, are covalently linked by disulfide bonds into highly organized complexes (33Omeis I.A.

It has been shown that the recombinant isolated PTX3 C-terminal domain, expressed as a monomeric species, is not able to bind C1q unless polymerized through chemical cross-linking, thus suggesting a role for the protein multimer in complement recognition possibly dependent on avidity and/or cooperativity mechanisms (23Bottazzi B.

PTX3 C-terminal domain three-dimensional structures have been elaborated by homology modeling based on human SAP (Protein Data Bank code 1sac) and CRP (Protein Data Bank code 1b09) crystal structures (22Goodman A.R.

Most interestingly, the pattern of amino acid residues located at the protomer interface in SAP pentamers is not conserved in PTX3, suggesting that PTX3 quaternary assembly might not fit the characteristic short pentraxin pentameric arrangement (38Introna M. Alles V.V. Castellano M. Picardi G. De Gioia L. Bottazzi B. Peri G. Breviario F. Salmona M. De Gregorio L. Dragani T.A. Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Hamilton T.A. Mantovani A. Blood. 1996; 87: 1862-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to CRP and SAP, PTX3 oligomers are stabilized by covalent bonds (23Bottazzi B. Vouret-Craviari V. Bastone A. De Gioia L. Matteucci C. Peri G. Spreafico F. Pausa M. D'Ettorre C. Gianazza E. Tagliabue A. Salmona M. Tedesco F. Introna M. Mantovani A. J. Biol.

The mature protein contains nine cysteine residues: three are located within the N-terminal region (Cys47, Cys49, and Cys103), and six are in the C-terminal domain (Cys179, Cys210, Cys271, Cys317, Cys318, and Cys357). Cys residues at positions 210 and 271 are highly conserved among pentraxins and based on the homology with CRP and SAP are predicted to be engaged in an intrachain disulfide bond (22Goodman A.R.

In this study we resolved the recombinant PTX3 oligomeric assembly, determining the number of subunits forming the functional protein. Both SDS-PAGE, performed under non-reducing conditions, and native-PAGE, carried out according to the Ferguson plot method, showed PTX3 to form mainly covalent octamers. We then identified the network of disulfide bonds stabilizing PTX3 multimers by exploiting two complementary approaches: mass spectrometry and Cys to Ser site-directed mutagenesis. Based on data from both techniques a topological map of PTX3 interchain disulfide bonds was drawn where the protein molecule is represented as a covalent octamer composed of two equivalent tetramers. The contribution of disulfide bonds to protein oligomerization was assessed by PAGE analysis under non-denaturing conditions. The new structural constraints were used to build a refined model of the PTX3 C-terminal domain. A previous study showed that cumuli from Ptx3-deficient mice are unable to organize the glycosaminoglycan HA in a stable matrix and that exogenously added recombinant PTX3 rescues defective cumulus expansion ex vivo (9Salustri A. Garlanda C. Hirsch E. De Acetis M. Maccagno A. Bottazzi B. Doni A. Bastone A. Mantovani G. Beck Peccoz P. Salvatori G. Mahoney D.J. Day A.J. Siracusa G. Romani L. Mantovani A.

We report here that the rescue activity of PTX3 mutants, forming tetramers instead of octamers, was comparable to that of the wt protein. PTX3 mutants, lacking the entire set of interchain disulfide bonds and mainly composed of dimers, proved less effective than the wt protein in rescuing defective cumulus expansion. PTX3 oligomerization is thus essential to protein functionality within the cumulus matrix. Moreover the two tetramers composing the native PTX3 octamer appear to act as functional units in cumulus matrix organization. These findings showed that PTX3 multimeric status plays a key role in defining the biological activity of the protein. Purified Proteins and AntibodiesâHuman recombinant PTX3 was purified from a CHO 3.5 cell line stably and constitutively expressing the protein as described previously (39Rivieccio V. Esposito A. Bellofiore P. Palladino P. Sassano M. Colombo M. Verdoliva A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 51: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Molecular weight calibrants (thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, lactate dehydrogenase, and bovine serum albumin) were purchased from GE Healthcare. Biotin-labeled rabbit anti-human PTX3 polyclonal antibody Î±PTX3pb and rat anti-human PTX3 monoclonal antibody MNB4 were obtained from âMario Negriâ Pharmacological Research Institute, Milan, Italy. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was from GE Healthcare, and rabbit anti-rat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was from Dako, Glostrup, Denmark. Enzymes and ChemicalsâProteomics grade trypsin (from porcine pancreas), Î±-chymotrypsin (NÎ±-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone-treated from bovine pancreas), endoproteinase Asp-N (from Pseudomonas fragi mutant strain), and endoproteinase Glu-C (from Staphylococcus aureus V8) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. DNA Taq polymerase and restriction enzymes applied in molecular cloning were from Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan. Tris acetate 3-8% gradient gels were obtained from Invitrogen. Other electrophoresis reagents and nonfat dry milk were from Bio-Rad. Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membranes and ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents were from GE Healthcare. Phosphate-buffered saline tablets, Tris base, NH4HCO3, NaCl, Tween 20, dithiothreitol (DTT), iodoacetamide, and Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other reagents and solvents were from Carlo Erba, Rodano, Italy and were of the highest purity available. Ferguson PlotâAliquots of purified recombinant PTX3 (5 Î¼g/lane) were loaded on homogeneous polyacrylamide gels cast at 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5% (w/v) total acrylamide concentration (% T) in the absence of SDS. Runs were performed under non-denaturing conditions in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm glycine, pH 8.3, at 150-V constant voltage for 1 h, and proteins were detected by Coomassie staining. Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) were used as molecular mass calibrants. Protein mobility was analyzed by Ferguson plot as described previously (40Butterman M. Tietz D. OrbaÌn L. Chrambach A. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly the relationship between protein mobility (Î¼) and sieving matrix concentration (% T) may be written as log10(Î¼)=log10(Î¼0)-Kr(&percnt;T)(Eq. 1) where Î¼0 is the free solution mobility (zero concentration of sieving matrix) and Kr is the retardation coefficient (which is directly related to protein shape and molecular weight). A standard curve (namely the Ferguson plot) was constructed by plotting the logarithm of calibrant relative mobility (log10Rf) as a function of total polyacrylamide concentration (% T). Retardation coefficients (Kr) were then computed from the plot slope and graphed versus molecular mass (Kr plot). PTX3 samples were processed in the same way as the calibrants, and their molecular mass was finally calculated by Kr plot interpolation. In a separate set of experiments, electrophoresis mobility data for Ferguson plot analysis of purified recombinant PTX3 were derived from Western blots (WBs). Briefly aliquots of protein (20 ng/lane) were loaded on native gels and run under the same experimental conditions as above. Gels were then blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, revealed by immunodetection (see below), and submitted to Ferguson plot analysis as described above. SDS-PAGE and WBâAliquots of purified recombinant PTX3 (either 2 Î¼g for Coomassie staining or 20 ng for immunodetection) were resolved on Tris acetate 3-8% gradient or Tris-glycine 9% homogeneous gels under denaturing conditions in the presence or absence of DTT. Following electrophoresis, proteins were either revealed by Coomassie staining or transferred to Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membranes for subsequent immunodetection. Blotted membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 Â°C with a 1:2,000 MNB4 dilution in blocking buffer. This antibody recognizes a linear epitope mapping in the N-terminal domain of human PTX3 (29Camozzi M. Rusnati M. Bugatti A. Bottazzi B. Mantovani A. Bastone A. Inforzato A. Vincenti S. Bracci L.

Following an additional incubation with rabbit anti-rat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, membranes were finally developed with ECL Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions. PTX3 Proteolysis and MALDI-MSâPurified recombinant PTX3 in phosphate-buffered saline (1 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, by ultrafiltration on Microcon YM-30 centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Protein samples (200 Î¼g) were subjected to proteolysis by incubation with trypsin, Î±-chymotrypsin, Asp-N, or Glu-C endoproteinases. Digestions were performed in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, at 37 Â°C for 16 h in a 225-Î¼l final volume using enzyme: protein ratios of 1:50, 1:100, 1:50, and 1:40 (w/w), respectively. Reactions were terminated by addition of 25 Î¼l of 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilization. PTX3 peptide mixtures were then resuspended in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, and split in 50-Î¼g aliquots. Some aliquots were directly submitted to MS analysis; others were first reduced and/or alkylated by incubation with 1 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 Â°C and/or 20 mm iodoacetamide for an additional 30 min at room temperature. Prior to MALDI-MS analysis, peptide mixtures from endoproteinase digestions were desalted by reversed phase chromatography on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly peptide samples were loaded on a Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column (500 Î¼m; 2.0-mm inner diameter Ã 15-cm length; particle size, 300 AÌ; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) equilibrated by a 95% solvent A, 5% solvent B mixture (solvent A: 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 95% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). Following an isocratic washing step at 5% solvent B for 10 min, a fast linear gradient was applied from 5 to 95% solvent B over 1 min, and peptide mixtures were eluted at 95% solvent B. The flow rate was set to 0.2 ml/min, and peptide elution was monitored as UV absorbance at both 216 and 280 nm. Peptide mixtures, eluted as a single peak, were manually collected and immediately freezedried. Positive ion MALDI-MS analyses of PTX3 peptides were carried out on a Bruker Daltonics Reflex II TOF/TOF MALDI spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) operating in reflectron mode. The MALDI matrix was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 1 ml of acetonitrile, 0.2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (70:30, v/v). Typically 1 Î¼l of matrix was applied to the metallic sample plate, and 1 Î¼l of analyte was then added. Acceleration and reflector voltages were set as foll"

However, CaSR is also expressed in the nervous system, where its role is unknown. We found large amounts of CaSR in perinatal mouse sympathetic neurons when their axons were innervating and branching extensively in their targets. Manipulating CaSR function in these neurons by varying [Ca(2+)](o), using CaSR agonists and antagonists, or expressing a dominant-negative CaSR markedly affected neurite growth in vitro. Sympathetic neurons lacking CaSR had smaller neurite arbors in vitro, and sympathetic innervation density was reduced in CaSR-deficient mice in vivo. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons, which also express CaSR, had smaller dendrites when transfected with dominant-negative CaSR in postnatal organotypic cultures. Our findings reveal a crucial role for CaSR in regulating the growth of neural processes in the peripheral and central nervous systems."
https://openalex.org/W2022719025,"T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory receptor (CD28) signals cooperate in activating T cells, although understanding of how these pathways are themselves regulated is incomplete. We found that Homer2 and Homer3, members of the Homer family of cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins, are negative regulators of T cell activation. This is achieved through binding of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and by competing with calcineurin. Homer-NFAT binding was also antagonized by active serine-threonine kinase AKT, thereby enhancing TCR signaling via calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT. This corresponded with changes in cytokine expression and an increase in effector-memory T cell populations in Homer-deficient mice, which also developed autoimmune-like pathology. These results demonstrate a further means by which costimulatory signals are regulated to control self-reactivity."

We used genome comparisons to conclude that the promoter regions of COX6AH and COX7AH lack NRF sites but have conserved myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) elements.

NRF1 regulates MEF2A promoter-reporters according to overexpression, RNA interference underexpression, and promoter element mutation studies. As there are four mammalian MEF2 isotypes, we used an isoform-specific antibody in ChIP to confirm MEF2A binding to the COX6AH promoter. These findings support a role for MEF2A as an intermediary in coordinating respiratory chain subunit expression in heart and muscle through a NRF1 â MEF2A â COXH transcriptional cascade. MEF2A also bound the MEF2A and PPARGC1A promoters in ChIP, placing it within a feedback loop with PGC1Î± in controlling NRF1 activity.

These act in concert to transfer electrons from succinate or NADH to molecular oxygen while pumping protons from the matrix to the intermembranous space, establishing the electrochemical gradient required for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (1Scheffler I.E.

This is underscored by the mito deficiency and peri-implant lethality of nrf1 null mouse embryos (11Huo L. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell.

Although the entire ETC can be regarded as functioning as a single unit, the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase (COX, complex IV) involves the largest free energy change among ETC reactions (1Scheffler I.E. Mitochondria. Wiley-Liss, New York1999: 141-245Google Scholar). Subunits I, II, and III that together form the catalytic core of COX are encoded in the mito genome, whereas the remaining 10 subunits serve structural or regulatory functions and are products of nuclear genes. Among ETC enzymes, COX alone has tissue-specific subunit isoforms that are the products of separate nuclear genes. Thus, there are both ubiquitous (L, for liver) and heart and muscle-specific (H) isoforms of subunits VIa and VIIa 5Genes encoding the H and L forms of COX VII are sometimes referred to as COX7A1 and COX7A2, respectively. in all mammals, and some species also have L and H variants of COX VIII (2Scarpulla R.C.

D'Elia D. Barsanti P. Caggese C. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R11.1-R11.7Crossref Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have suggested that COXH may confer sensitivity of muscle COX activity and respiration to cellular energy demands (14Anthony G. Reimann A. Kadenbach B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1652-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this study, we began with the question as to how the COXH subunit isoforms are coordinately expressed with one another in a tissue-specific manner but also in harmony with other nuclear-encoded proteins that are critical to mito function in muscle. We show that MEF2A, the gene encoding the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A), is a target of NRF1 regulation. COXH subunit genes are in turn targets of MEF2 (15Yu M. Jaradat S.A.

We therefore propose that a transcriptional cascade exists (NRF1 â MEF2A â COXH) that functions with the NRF â [TFAM, TFBM] â ETCmito cascade and direct NRF â ETCnucl regulation to provide coordinate control of respiratory chain component expression in muscle.

Templates for other cRNA probes were PCR amplicon fragments subcloned into pBluescript, oriented to permit cRNA production from the vector T7 promoter. The 149-bp template for murine nrf1 cRNA used mouse heart RNA and reverse transcription-PCR with primers 5â²-cccggatCCCAGGCTCAGCTTCGGGCA-3â² and 5â²-cccgaattcGCTCTTCTGTGCGGACATCAC-3â². The underlined letters are restriction sites used in subcloning. The uppercase letters are cDNA sequences lowercase are extraneous to the cDNA but used to generate the PCR amplicon and restriction site. Templates for murine cox subunits were made using PCR on expressed sequence-tagged cDNAs or reverse transcription-PCR using liver and heart RNA. Primers and expressed sequence tag clones were: cox6aL (143 bp) IMAGE clone 3487598, 5â²-gggcgcggatcCTCGGATGTGGAAGGCCCTC-3â² and 5â²-gggcgcgaattCTTGGTCCTGATGCGCAGG-3â²; cox6aH (120 bp) IMAGE clone 695934, 5â²-gggcgcggatCCAACACCTGGCGCCTC-3â² and 5â²-gggcgcgaattcGGTGGTGATACGGGATGAAC-3â²; cox7aL (206 bp) 129 strain heart cDNA and IMAGE clone 1248366, 5â²-gggcgcggatccGAGGATAATGGGATGCCAG-3â² and 5â²-gggcgcgaatTCAGATTCCTGGTCCATCG-3â²; cox7aH (171 bp) IMAGE clone 463628, 5â²-gggcgcggaTCCCAGGCTCTGGTCCGG-3â² and 5â²-gggcgcgaattcGCCCCCCAGAGTCAGCGTC-3â²; cox7aR (102 bp) IMAGE clone 678445, 5â²-gggcgcggaTCCAGAAGGCTGATGGTTTCC-3â² and 5â²-gggcgcgaatTCAGGCAGTAGATGGTCCCTC-3â². Reverse transcriptase reactions (Promega) used 1 Î¼g of total RNA and an oligo(dT) primer. Real-time PCR was performed using a MX-3000 multiplex thermal cycler and SYBR Green with reaction conditions according to the master mix reagent supplier (Stratagene). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) primers for human cDNAs were: (GAPDH, 238 bp) 5â²-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3â² and 5â²-TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG-3â²; (NRF1, 281 bp) 5â²-GTACAAGAGCATGATCCTGGA-3â² and 5â²-GCTCTTCTGTGCGGACATC-3â²; (MEF2A, 187 bp) 5â²-GTGTACTCAGCAATGCCGAC-3â² and 5â²-AACCCTGAGATAACTGCCCTC-3â²; (CYCS, 106 bp) 5â²-GTTGAAAAGGGAGGCAAGCA-3â² and 5â²-TGTTCTTATTGGCGGCTGTG-3â²; and (ACTB, 233 bp) 5â²-GGACTTCGAGCAAGAGATGG-3â² and 5â²-AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG-3â².

Mouse mef2a and nrf1 primer pairs were identical to the respective human MEF2A and NRF1 primers. Real-time PCR results were analyzed using MX-3000 software, and the various mRNA quantities were normalized to that of Î²-actin (ACTB or actb). In brief, the fractional difference in the expression of a gene of interest (goi) mRNA in experimental (e) versus control (c) samples was determined using the formula ÎmRNA (arbitrary units) = 2{Îgoi âÎactb}, where Îgoi is the difference ([e] â [c]) in cycle number at critical threshold for the goi and Îactb is the difference ([e] â [c]) in cycle number at critical threshold for actb. Fluorescence determinations were also used to establish conditions (cycle number) to retrieve aliquots of parallel reactions for direct visualization of amplicon levels by agarose gel electrophoresis.

Mutations corresponded to those used in mobility shift assay probes (Fig. 3C). A reverse luciferase primer was used in combination with 5â²-gggcgctgg â cCACGgGCAGCACA-3â² (m1NRF1) or 5â²-gggcgcttt â aaACttGCAGCACA-3â² (m2NRF1) on a MEF2A-Luc template. Amplicons were cut with NcoI and either MscI (m1NRF1) or DraI (m2NRF1), and the NcoI-blunt fragments were substituted into FspI-and NcoI-cut S-MEF2Ap1-Luc. A BamHI-XbaI fragment was substituted into S-MEF2Ap2-Luc to give p2[m1NRF1]-Luc. This strategy was also used with p1[m1MEF2]-Luc and p2[m1MEF2]-Luc (19Ramachandran B. Yu G. Li S. Zhu B. Gulick T. J.

II-E-Luc was made by isolating and subcloning a RPCI-98-01L01 BAC clone EcoRI fragment, using this as a template with forward vector and reverse (5â²-gggcgcgtcgacTCTCCTCTCATTGCGTTTTCC-3â²) primers in PCR, and subcloning the EcoRI- and SalI-restricted amplicon into tata-Luc. An analogous construct containing an EWG element mutation, II-E[m1EWG]-Luc, was made by combining PCR with vector primers and 5â²-GGTTTTTTGCcCATGgGCTCCTTCCCCACAG-3â² and 5â²-GAAGGAGCcCATGgGCAAAAAACCGTAAACTC-3â².

The human NRF1 coding region was PCR-amplified from IMAGE cDNA clone 591311 template using primers (forward) 5â²-gggcgcaagcttgccaccATGGAGGAACACGGAGTGAC-3â² and (reverse) 5â²-gaggtggcggccgcttcaCTGTTCCAATGTCACCAC-3â², and the HindIII- and NotI-restricted amplicon was subcloned to make pCDNA-NRF1. pCDNA-NRF1ÎN85 was made using PCR on this template with forward primer 5â²-gggcgcaagcttgccaccATGGCAACAGGAAAGAAACG-3â² and a reverse vector primer followed by substitution of a HdIII- and EcoRI-restricted amplicon. pCDNA-NRF1VP16 was constructed using PCR with reverse primer 5â²-gaggcgccctgcaggCTGTTCCAATGTCACCACC-3â² to delete the NRF1 stop codon and then reintroducing the coding region into a modified pCDNA3 containing sequences encoding the herpes simplex virus VP16 transactivation domain downstream of an SbfI site. pCDNA3-EWG and -EWGÎN144 and pAc-NRF1 and -NRF1ÎN85 were constructed by swapping coding regions between pAc and pCDNA vectors. A derivative of pCDNA3 containing a viral internal ribosome entry site and enhanced green fluorescent protein was used in pCDNA-NRF1VP16/GFP. pCDNA-PGC1Î± included the IMAGE clone 30094033 SalI to NotI insert. Mobility Shift AssaysâThe NRF1 coding region from pCDNA-NRF1 was subcloned into pET28 (Novagen) to give pET-NRF1. pET-NRF1myc was created by substituting a NRF1 insert lacking a stop codon from pCDNA-NRF1VP16 with a SbfI to NotI fragment containing sequence encoding the c-myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN) and a stop codon. In vitro transcription/translation reactions used these plasmid templates with the TnT system (Promega). Muscle cell nuclear extracts were prepared, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted as described previously (19Ramachandran B. Yu G. Li S. Zhu B. Gulick T. J. Biol.

Chromatin ImmunoprecipitationâThree 15-cm dishes of C2C12 or HEK 293 cells were grown to confluence prior to cross-linking in situ, nuclear isolation, DNA shearing, preclearing, and immunoprecipitation. Procedures used were modified from the ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif) using enzymatic DNA shearing as described previously in detail (19Ramachandran B. Yu G. Li S. Zhu B. Gulick T. J. Biol.

HeLa and HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. S2 cells were maintained at 25 Â°C in DS2 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK 293 cells in 15-cm dishes were transfected with 10 Î¼gof pCDNA-NRF1VP16/GFP prior to GFP+ versus GFPâ fluorescence-activated cell sorting after 48 h. Promoter reporter assays in mammalian cells in 12-well plates were performed as described using Superfect (Qiagen) (19Ramachandran B. Yu G. Li S. Zhu B. Gulick T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10318-10329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). S2 cells in 6-well plates were transfected at 50% confluence. Triplicate wells received 3 Î¼g of reporter plasmid and 1 Î¼g of expression vector, and cells were harvested for luciferase assays after 48 h. 10T1/2 cells stably transformed with a MyoD-ER fusion were maintained in medium with G418 and 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, and myogenesis was induced using 10 nm estradiol as described (17Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RNA InterferenceâsiRNA transfections were performed using HiPerFect (Qiagen) according to the supplier instructions. C2C12 cells were transfected every 24 h for 2 days with subdivisions to maintain cell subconfluence, and RNA was harvested after a total elapsed time of 72 h. HEK 293 cells were transfected once 48 h before RNA harvesting at 80% cell confluence. 75 ng/well (12-well plate) or 150 ng/well (6-well plate) of dsRNA was used in transfections. Double-stranded siRNAs all had 19 bp corresponding to the targeted mRNA and 3â² UU extensions on each strand. Human siRNA sense sequences were: GAPDH, 5â²-GUCAACGGAUUUGGUCGUAUU-3â²; NRF1, 5â²-GAAACGGCCUCAUGUAUUUUU-3â², 5â²-UAGUAUAGCUCAUCUUGUAUU-3â², 5â²-CACAUUGGCUGAUGCUUCAUU-3â², and 5â²-GCUAUUGUCCUCUGUAUCUUU-3â².

A control siRNA that fails to recognize any human or mouse targets (Qiagen catalog No. 1027280) was used as a negative control. An Alex Fluor 488-labeled negative control ds-siRNA (Qiagen) was used initially to optimize transfection conditions. Miscellaneous Reagents and ProceduresâAll plasmid segments derived from PCR were verified by dideoxy sequencing (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Mouse anti-myc epitope (clone 9E10) was from United States Biologicals, and anti-NRF1 antiserum was the generous gift of Richard Scarpula (Northwestern). MEF2 Regulatory Elements Are Common to Heart/Muscle-specific Respiratory Chain Subunit Gene PromotersâWe examined the distribution of cox6a and cox7a isoform mRNA in adult mouse tissues using RPA to discriminate between the highly similar mRNA sequences. Consistent with previous reports (22Parsons W.J. Williams R.S. Shelton J.M. Luo Y. Kessler D.J. Richardson J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H567-H574PubMed Google Scholar), cox6aH was present exclusively in skeletal muscle and heart, whereas cox6aL was expressed in all other tissues examined (Fig. 1). cox7aH was also expressed exclusively in striated muscle, and although cox7aL was highest in non-muscle tissues, it was present in skeletal muscle and quite abundant in heart. cox7aR, a third isoform of this subunit (23Watanabe T. Inoue S. Hiroi H. Orimo A. Kawashima H. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), was expressed ubiquitously at a relatively low level. Using 10T1/2 MyoD-ER cells wherein myogenesis is induced by estrogen (24Bergstrom D.A. Penn B.H. Strand A. Perry R.L. Rudnicki M.A. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 587-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), isoform switching from cox6aL to cox6aH coincided with the appearance of a myosin heavy chain skeletal muscle differentiation marker (not shown). The COX6A, COX7A, and COX8 (H and L forms of each) are compact genes, each having a single promoter and splicing pattern and one initiation codon within the first exon (8Lenka N. Vijayasarathy C. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 309-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We compared 5â²-flanking region sequences of each of these genes among mammals to identify conserved elements (Fig. 1). Transgenic promoter-reporter studies in mice have shown that MEF2 and E box elements provide heart- and muscle-specific expression of mouse cox6aH (16Wan B. Moreadith R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26433-26440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The corresponding region of other mammalian COX6AH genes is highly conserved (25Bachman N.J. Riggs P.K. Siddiqui N. Makris G.J. Womack J.E. Lomax M.I. Genomics. 1997; 42: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Specifically, the region has either one canonical MEF2 element or two sites separated by 7â10 bp (supplemental Table S1). COX7AH and COX8H gene regulatory regions also have functional MEF2 elements (15Yu M. Jaradat S.A. Grossman L.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16Wan B. Moreadith R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26433-26440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). No sequences corresponding to NRF1 or NRF2 elements were detected in COXH promoters. By contrast, both the COX6AL and COX7AL promoters have putative or documented NRF1 or NRF2 elements (2Scarpulla R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 3Kelly D.P. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 8Lenka N. Vijayasarathy C. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 309-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but none has a MEF2 site. Although the COX7AR gene promoter region has not been functionally characterized, we found NRF1 and MEF2 elements within 1.2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS). No other transcription factor binding sites that are conserved and selectively present in the COXH versus COXL promoters were found. Forced Expression of NRF1 Induces MEF2A ExpressionâFour mammalian MEF2 genes encode MEF2 factors 6Primary transcripts of mammalian MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D, but not MEF2B, are alternatively spliced among exons containing coding sequences to produce multiple splicing variants or isoforms. In this paper we refer to MEF2 isotype proteins as those encoded by the different genes and to MEF2 isoform or variant proteins as those encoded by splicing variants. (18Zhu B. Ramachandran B.

https://openalex.org/W1971478609,"Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) is the initial component of a pentose phosphate pathway inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that generates NADPH for ER enzymes. In liver H6PD is required for the 11-oxoreductase activity of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, which converts inactive 11-oxo-glucocorticoids to their active 11-hydroxyl counterparts; consequently, H6PD null mice are relatively insensitive to glucocorticoids, exhibiting fasting hypoglycemia, increased insulin sensitivity despite elevated circulating levels of corticosterone, and increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscles normally enriched in type II (fast) fibers, which have increased glycogen content. Here, we show that H6PD null mice develop a severe skeletal myopathy characterized by switching of type II to type I (slow) fibers. Running wheel activity and electrically stimulated force generation in isolated skeletal muscle are both markedly reduced. Affected muscles have normal sarcomeric structure at the electron microscopy level but contain large intrafibrillar membranous vacuoles and abnormal triads indicative of defects in structure and function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). SR proteins involved in calcium metabolism, including the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), calreticulin, and calsequestrin, show dysregulated expression. Microarray analysis and real-time PCR demonstrate overexpression of genes encoding proteins in the unfolded protein response pathway. We propose that the absence of H6PD induces a progressive myopathy by altering the SR redox state, thereby impairing protein folding and activating the unfolded protein response pathway. These studies thus define a novel metabolic pathway that links ER stress to skeletal muscle integrity and function."
https://openalex.org/W2170749456,"Information about sensory stimuli is represented by spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. The complexity of the central nervous system, however, frequently obscures the origin and properties of signals and noise that underlie these activity patterns. We minimized this constraint by examining mechanisms governing correlated activity in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) under conditions in which light-evoked responses traverse a specific circuit, the rod bipolar pathway. Signals and noise in this circuit produced correlated synaptic input to neighboring On and Off RGCs. Temporal modulation of light intensity did not alter the degree to which noise in the input to nearby RGCs was correlated, and action potential generation in individual RGCs was largely insensitive to differences in network noise generated by dynamic and static light stimuli. Together, these features enable noise in shared circuitry to diminish simultaneous action potential generation in neighboring On and Off RGCs under a variety of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1992379971,"Î²-Catenin is the central signalling molecule of the canonical Wnt pathway, where it activates target genes in a complex with lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor transcription factors in the nucleus. The regulation of Î²-catenin activity is thought to occur via a cytoplasmatic multiprotein complex that includes the serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) that phosphorylates Î²-catenin, marking it for degradation by the proteasome. Here, we provide evidence showing that GSK-3Î² has a nuclear function in downregulating the activity of Î²-catenin. Using colorectal cell lines that express a mutant form of Î²-catenin, which cannot be phosphorylated by GSK-3Î² and ectopically expressed mutant Î²-catenin protein, we show that nuclear GSK-3Î² functions in a mechanism that does not involve Î²-catenin phosphorylation to reduce the levels of Wnt signalling. We show that GSK-3Î² enters the nucleus, forms a complex with Î²-catenin and lowers the levels of Î²-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription in a mechanism that involves GSK-3Î²âAxin binding."
https://openalex.org/W1993688512,"Activation of the agr system, a major regulator of staphylococcal virulence, is initiated by the binding of a specific autoinducing peptide (AIP) to the extracellular domain of AgrC, a classical receptor histidine protein kinase. There are four known agr specificity groups in Staphylococcus aureus, and we have previously localized the determinant of AIP receptor specificity to the C-terminal half of the AgrC sensor domain. We have now identified the specific amino acid residues that determine ligand activation specificity for agr groups I and IV, the two most closely related. Comparison of the AgrC-I and AgrC-IV sequences revealed a set of five divergent residues in the region of the second extracellular loop of the receptor that could be responsible. Accordingly, we exchanged these residues between AgrC-I and AgrC-IV and tested the resulting constructs for activation by the respective AIPs, measuring activation kinetics with a transcriptional fusion of blaZ to the principal agr promoter, P3. Exchange of all five residues caused a complete switch in receptor specificity. Replacement of two of the AgrC-IV residues by the corresponding residues in AgrC-I caused the receptor to be activated by AIP-I nearly as well as the wild type AgrC-I receptor. Replacement of two different AgrC-I residues by the corresponding AgrC-IV residues broadened receptor recognition specificity to include both AIPs. Various types of intermediate activity were observed with other replacement mutations.

In hematopoietic cells, Ikaros localizes to pericentromeric heterochromatin (PC-HC) where it recruits its target genes, resulting in their activation or repression via chromatin remodeling. The function of Ikaros is controlled by post-translational modifications. CK2 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate Ikaros at its C terminus, affecting cell cycle progression. Using in vivo labeling of murine thymocytes followed by phosphopeptide mapping, we identified four novel Ikaros phosphorylation sites. Functional analysis of phosphomimetic mutants showed that the phosphorylation of individual amino acids determines the affinity of Ikaros toward probes derived from PC-HC. In vivo experiments demonstrated that targeting of Ikaros to PC-HC is regulated by phosphorylation. The ability of Ikaros to bind the upstream regulatory elements of its known target gene terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) was decreased by phosphorylation of two amino acids. In thymocytes, Ikaros acts as a repressor of the TdT gene. Induction of differentiation of thymocytes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin results in transcriptional repression of TdT expression. This process has been associated with increased binding of Ikaros to the upstream regulatory element of TdT. Phosphopeptide analysis of in vivo-labeled thymocytes revealed that Ikaros undergoes dephosphorylation during induction of thymocyte differentiation and that dephosphorylation is responsible for increased DNA binding affinity of Ikaros toward the TdT promoter. We propose a model whereby reversible phosphorylation of Ikaros at specific amino acids controls the subcellular localization of Ikaros as well as its ability to regulate TdT expression during thymocyte differentiation.

The mechanism through which Ikaros controls the expression of its target genes remains unclear. Ikaros contains an activation domain (9Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and has been shown to act as a direct transcriptional activator, although abundant data support a role for Ikaros in heritable gene silencing. The majority of Ikaros protein has been shown to produce a punctate pattern of staining in the nuclei of lymphoid cells. Co-staining with antibodies against the murine homologue of Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin protein-1 has shown that the Ikaros protein is localized to pericentromeric heterochromatin (PC-HC) 3The abbreviations used are:PC-HCpericentromeric heterochromatinTdTterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferaseIK-CTSC terminus of IkarosPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateDRB5,6-dichloro-1-Î²-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole.

Using a combined immunofluorescence in situ hybridization approach, Ikaros has been shown to co-localize with Î³-satellite-labeled centromeric regions (10Brown K.E. Guest S.S. Smale S.T. Hahm K.

Ikaros associates with Mi-2Î², a catalytic subunit of the histone deacetylase complex, NuRD, as well as with BRG1, a catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex that acts as an activator of gene expression (13Koipally J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7572-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Ikaros can also associate with two co-repressors, Sin3 and the C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP), which supports the hypothesis that Ikaros has a role in transcriptional repression (13Koipally J.

The current hypothesis is that Ikaros binds the upstream region of target genes and aids in their recruitment to PC-HC, resulting in repression or activation of the gene (10Brown K.E. Guest S.S.

Studying the mechanism of Ikaros action is further complicated by the paucity of credible known Ikaros target genes. Ikaros has been shown to repress expression of the Î»5 gene (18Thompson E.C.

The regulation of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) gene expression during thymocyte differentiation has been extensively studied (20Trinh L.A. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Weinmann A.S. Hahm K.

Ikaros has been shown to bind in vivo to the Dâ² upstream regulatory element of the TdT gene where it competes with the Elf-1 transcription factor to regulate expression of TdT during thymocyte differentiation (20Trinh L.A. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Weinmann A.S. Hahm K. Ernst P. Garraway I.P. Merkenschlager M. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1817-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The activity of the most abundant Ikaros isoform is regulated by association with other Ikaros isoforms (24Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 25Ronni T. Payne K.J. Ho S. Bradley M.N. Dorsam G. Dovat S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2538-2547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as well as association with other members of the Ikaros family (26Dovat S. Montecino-Rodriguez E. Schuman V. Teitell M.A. Dorshkind K. Smale S.T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3508-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The association with smaller Ikaros isoforms that lack the DNA binding domain results in impaired Ikaros function; thus, these isoforms act as dominant negative mutants (24Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The function of Ikaros is also controlled by post-translational modifications. Sumoylation of Ikaros was found to regulate its interaction with Sin3, Mi-2Î², and CtBP corepressors of transcription (27Gomez-del Arco P. Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2688-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). During mitosis Ikaros is inactivated in a cell cycle-specific manner by phosphorylation at its evolutionarily conserved linker sequences (28Dovat S. Ronni T. Russell D. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Ikaros is constitutively phosphorylated at multiple sites. A previous study identified several phosphorylated amino acids located primarily within the C-terminal region of Ikaros. Phosphorylation of Ikaros at its C-terminal region by CK2 kinase was shown to regulate the ability of Ikaros to control G1/S cell cycle progression (29Gomez-del Arco P. Maki K. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2797-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, additional phosphorylation sites have been identified, although their functional and biological significance were not reported (30Sridharan R. Smale S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30227-30238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Here we identify and provide functional analysis of four additional Ikaros phosphorylation sites. Results show that the phosphorylation of particular amino acids alters Ikaros subcellular localization as well as its DNA binding affinity toward probes derived from PC-HC and from the regulatory elements of its target genes. We also provide evidence for the physiological role of reversible phosphorylation of these amino acids in controlling expression of TdT, a known Ikaros target gene, during thymocyte differentiation. Our results also suggest that these sites are targets for CK2 kinase or another kinase in the CK2 pathway. These data provide new evidence for the mechanism by which Ikaros controls expression of the TdT gene during T cell development and for the role of CK2 kinase in regulating Ikaros function. CellsâThe murine VL3-3M2 thymocyte leukemia cell line has been described previously (31Groves T. Katis P. Madden Z. Manickam K. Ramsden D. Wu G. Guidos C.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5011-5022PubMed Google Scholar). The human 293T endothelial kidney cell line and the murine the NIH/3T3 (3T3) fibroblast cell line were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA. Murine thymocytes were isolated as described previously (32Su R.C. Brown K.E. Saaber S. Fisher A.G. Merkenschlager M. Smale S.T. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocol. Treatment of thymocytes with PMA plus ionomycin has been described previously (20Trinh L.A. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Weinmann A.S. Hahm K. Ernst P. Garraway I.P. Merkenschlager M. Smale S.T.

AntibodiesâThe antibodies used to detect the C terminus (IK-CTS) of Ikaros (comprising amino acids (320â515 of the murine IK-VI isoform) have been described previously (33Hahm K. Cobb B.S. McCarty A.S. Brown K.E. Klug C.A. Lee R. Akashi K. Weissman I.L. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 782-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In Vivo Labeling and Phosphopeptide MappingâFor in vivo labeling, cells were incubated with radioactive orthophosphate. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (CD4+/CD8+ murine thymocytes, murine peripheral T cells, and VL3-3M2) or with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS (HEK293T). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for 4 h with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in phosphate-free medium. Cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed on ice for 20 min in solubilizing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL pH 7.2, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 Î¼m leupeptin), and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 Â°C for 20 min. Lysates were incubated with anti-IK-CTS antibodies for 1 h at 4 Â°C, and the resulting immunocomplexes were absorbed to protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), washed 4 times with solubilizing buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nylon membrane, and subjected to autoradiography. The phosphopeptide mapping of Ikaros from labeled cells was performed by two-dimensional separation on thin layer cellulose (TLC) plates. We have used a protocol described by Boyle et al. (34Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ikaros was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-IK-CTS antibodies, transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by autoradiography. The part of the membrane that contained the Ikaros band was excised and soaked in 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-360; Sigma) in 0.1 m acetic acid at 37 Â°C for 30 min to block nonspecific absorption of trypsin. After brief washing with water, the membrane was resuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and simultaneously digested with 10 Î¼g of trypsin and 10 Î¼g of chymotrypsin. Tryptic peptides were released from the membrane during digestion. After digestion, ammonium bicarbonate was removed by repeated lyophilization and resuspended in sterile water. Thin layer electrophoresis was carried out on a TLC plate in pH 1.9 buffer in the Hunter thin layer electrophoresis unit (HTLE 7000; CBS Scientific, Inc., Del Mar, CA) at 1000 V for 20 min. After electrophoresis, thin layer ascending chromatography was done in the second dimension using organic solvent buffer to separate peptides based on their ability to partition between mobile (buffer) and stationary (cellulose) phases. The mobility of phosphopeptides in the electrophoresis dimension is determined by the electrical charge and the mass of the peptide, whereas the mobility of the peptide in the ascending chromatography is determined by the hydrophobicity of the peptide. After chromatography, plates were dried and exposed. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Ikaros ProteinâMurine full-length Ikaros isoform IK-VI cDNA was amplified and cloned into a pGEX-2T glutathione S-transferase-containing vector (GE Healthcare) that was cleaved with BamH1 and EcoR1 as described previously (35Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). IK-VI-glutathione S-transferase-containing pGEX-2T plasmid was transformed and expressed into the SCS-1 strain of Escherichia coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). E. coli were induced with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactopyranoside for 2 h in the presence of 100 Î¼m ZnCl2. The glutathione S-transferase-IK-VI fusion protein was purified from E. coli according to the standard procedures (GE Healthcare) except that all of the buffers contained 10 Î¼m ZnCl2 as described previously (35Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Fractions that contained purified glutathione S-transferase-IK-VI protein were pooled and stored at â80 Â°C. In Vitro Kinase AssayâThe in vitro kinase reaction was carried out with 10 ng of purified recombinant full-length Ikaros IK-VI protein incubated with 4 units of CK2 kinase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 Â°C in the presence of [Î³-32P]ATP. Immunoprecipitated Ikaros protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (28Dovat S. Ronni T. Russell D. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Proteolytic digestion of the Ikaros band was performed simultaneously with trypsin and chymotrypsin. Phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described above and previously (34Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Plasmids, Transfection, and Retroviral TransductionâAlanine or aspartate phosphomimetic substitution mutants for IK-VI were generated using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). For retrovirus generation, phosphomimetic IK-VI mutants were amplified by PCR and cloned between BglII and EcoRI sites of the murine stem cell virus internal ribosome entry site green fluorescent protein vector as described previously (12Cobb B.S.

Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The full-length Ikaros isoform IK-VI was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and its phosphomimetic mutants were transfected into 293T cells via the calcium phosphate method. 3T3 cells were transduced with ecotropic retrovirus. Confocal Microscopyâ3T3 cells were transduced with ecotropic retrovirus and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described previously (12Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Images were acquired at room temperature by a Leica TCS-SP MP Confocal and Multiphoton Microscope with a Leica DM-LFS body (upright fixed-stage microscope) using a 100Ã Leica HX PLAPO (Planapo) oil immersion lens with numerical aperture of 1.4 (Heidelberg, Germany). Biochemical ExperimentsâNuclear extractions, Western blots, and gel-shift experiments were performed as described previously (12Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G.

Mass SpectrometryâAfter the in vitro kinase reaction with CK2 kinase, samples were digested with trypsin in solution. Peptides were loaded onto a self-packed column using Michrom (Auburn, CA) âmagic C18â media. The peptides were then eluted using a reverse phase gradient and injected into the instrument via nanospray electrospray ionization. Spectra were collected using a linear trap quadrupole Fourier-transformed from Thermo Fisher Scientific (San Jose, CA). We screened for phosphopeptides using a neutral loss experiment during the acquisition. MS3 scanning events were triggered by detection of a neutral loss during the MS2 scan event of 98.0, 49.0, or 32.7 m/z. The data were searched against a human protein data base. Identified phosphopeptides from the search which were triggered by the neutral loss experiment were then manually inspected to verify the sites of phosphorylation. Identification of New Ikaros Phosphorylation Sites by in Vivo Labeling and Phosphopeptide MappingâPrevious reports provided evidence that Ikaros is phosphorylated at multiple sites by CK2 kinase. Phosphorylation of several amino acids had been mapped in the region between amino acids 383 and 404 within exon 7 as well as amino acid 63 (29Gomez-del Arco P. Maki K. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2797-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but sites that are less abundantly phosphorylated remained unknown. To identify the additional phosphorylation sites, we performed in vivo phosphopeptide mapping of Ikaros in murine thymocytes and in the murine thymocyte leukemia cell line VL3-3M2 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). To identify less abundantly phosphorylated sites, we used 5 Ã 107 cells for in vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate. After immunoprecipitation and separation on SDS-PAGE, a double digestion of the phosphorylated protein was performed with both trypsin and chymotrypsin to enhance resolution of the phosphorylated peptides. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of double-digested phosphoprotein revealed that Ikaros is phosphorylated constitutively at multiple sites with several phosphopeptides being easily detectable and resolved (Fig. 1A). The observed phosphorylation pattern was identical in VL3-3M2 cells, activated murine peripheral T cells, and the murine B cell line Bal17 (data not shown). A similar phosphopeptide mapping pattern for IK-VI was detected when this isoform was ectopically expressed in 293T (human embrionyl kidney carcinoma) cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that this phosphorylation was not tissue-specific. Phosphopeptide analysis of deletion mutants that span the entire Ikaros protein revealed that three different phosphopeptides are localized within the N-terminal end of Ikaros, whereas the fourth additional phosphopeptide is localized within exon 7 (data not shown). An examination of the potential phosphoacceptors within the N-terminal region of Ikaros suggested that amino acids 13, 23, and 101 might be phosphorylated. In addition, based on theoretical mobilities of the potential Ikaros phosphopeptides (34Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar), we calculated that amino acid 294 might be phosphorylated as well. To test this hypothesis and to identify phosphorylated amino acids, potential phosphoacceptor sites were mutated into alanine, and phosphopeptide mapping of these mutants was performed. Results showed that mutation of serine 13 abolishes phosphopeptide 1 (Fig. 1C), whereas mutation of threonine 23 abolishes phosphopeptide 2 (Fig. 1D). Simultaneous loading of the 13A and 23A samples restored all of the phosphopeptides observed with the wild-type protein (Fig. 1E). Similarly, alanine mutation of serine 101 abolished the phosphopeptide 3 (Fig. 1F), and mutation of serine 294 abolished phosphopeptide 4 (Fig. 1G). When 101A and 294A samples were simultaneously loaded, the wild-type map was again restored (Fig. 1H). These experiments identified four novel phosphorylation sites in the Ikaros protein. The positions of these sites are shown in Fig. 1, panel I. We also identified one additional phosphopeptide (data not shown) that represented a previously described phosphorylation at amino acid 63 (labeled as a star in Fig. 1). All four novel phosphorylated amino acids along with their surrounding sequences (Fig. 1J) are evolutionarily conserved between mouse and human, which suggests their biological relevance. Phosphorylation of Specific Amino Acids Determines the Ability of Ikaros to Bind DNA Probes Derived from Pericentromeric HeterochromatinâThe above results show that Ikaros is phosphorylated at multiple N-terminal amino acids. Phosphorylation of the Ikaros protein has been postulated to control its DNA binding ability. To determine whether phosphorylation of amino acids 13, 23, 63, 101, or 294 affects the ability of Ikaros to bind DNA, gel shift experiments were performed with nuclear extracts from HEK293T cells that overexpressed wild-type Ikaros or its phosphomimetic mutants. In phosphomimetic mutants the mutation of phosphorylation sites to alanine mimics constitutive dephosphorylation, whereas mutation into aspartate mimics constitutive phosphorylation. A major component of Ikaros function is localization to PC-HC. Ikaros binds to repetitive sequences within PC-HC that contain consensus Ikaros binding sites, and its localization to the PC-HC is directly related to its ability to bind these sequences (12Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We used radiolabeled DNA probes that contain a high affinity binding site from Î³ satellite repeat sequence that has previously been shown to confer Ikaros with the ability to localize to PC-HC in mouse (12Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The first probe, Î³ satellite A, contains two consensus Ikaros binding sites in close proximity to each other and is a target for high affinity binding of wild-type Ikaros. The second probe, Î³ satellite B, contains a single consensus Ikaros binding site that provides a target for low affinity binding of wild-type Ikaros protein. Potential differences in DNA binding affinity were quantified by phosphoimaging using the ImageQuant 5.1 program to measure the strength of shifted bands. Results showed that phosphomimetic substitutions to aspartate at amino acids 13 or 294 decrease the ability of Ikaros to bind the Î³ satellite A probe by 5-fold. Aspartate mutation of amino acid 23 reduces the ability of Ikaros to bind the same probe by 3-fold in both high extract (Fig. 2A, lanes 1â12) and low extract concentrations (Fig. 2A, lanes 13â20). Substitutions of the same amino acids to alanine did not change the DNA binding affinity of Ikaros for the Î³ satellite A probe (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when Î³ satellite B probe was used (Fig. 2B). Phosphomimetic substitutions at positions 13, 23, or 294 reduced binding ability toward Î³ satellite B probe by 3â4-fold in high extract concentrations (Fig. 2B, lanes 1â12), whereas DNA binding was abolished in low extract concentrations (Fig. 2B, lanes 13â20). No changes in DNA binding affinity toward the Î³ satellite A or Î³ satellite B probes were observed with phosphomimetic substitutions at positions 63 or 101. These data demonstrate that phosphorylation of a single amino acid can determine DNA binding affinity of Ikaros toward Î³ satellite repeats.

Here, we present a study aimed at engineering the substrate specificity of different HS 3-O-sulfotransferase isoforms. Based on the crystal structures, we identified a pair of amino acid residues responsible for selecting the substrates. Mutations of these residues altered the substrate specificities. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of tailoring the specificity of sulfotransferases to modify HS with desired functions."
https://openalex.org/W2052507160,"Endoglin is a cell-surface adhesion protein as well as a coreceptor for transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²). It is located on endothelial and few other cells, but also found on certain tumor cells. Brain metastatic breast tumor cells derived from the MDA-MB-231 cell line heavily express endoglin in contrast to the corresponding parental ones. To clarify whether this determines their invasive phenotype, we compared their biological properties with endoglin-silenced brain-metastatic cells, low-expressing parental cells and these transfected with L- and S-endoglins, isoforms transducing or lacking TGF-Î² signals. All L-endoglin-overexpressing cells were characterized by numerous invadopodia where endoglin was preferentially localized. Endoglin-expression resulted in elevated levels of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-19) and downregulation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In Boyden-chamber and wound-healing assays, endoglin-overexpressing cells showed a considerably higher migration and chemotaxis to TGF-Î². In 3D spheroid confrontation assays between breast tumor cells and TGF-Î²-secreting glioma cells, high L-endoglin-expressing cells invaded into the glioma-spheroids whereas low-endoglin-expressing cells dissociated in the culture; invasion was blocked by TGF-Î² antibodies. In contrast to parental cells, endoglin-overexpressing cells invaded deeply into mouse brain slices. Thus, endoglin expression on tumor cells enhances their invasive character by formation of invadopodia, extracellular proteolysis, chemotaxis and migration."

https://openalex.org/W2067921554,"There is accumulating evidence that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-activated pathways play important roles in cell growth and survival of BCR-ABL-transformed cells. We have previously shown that the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K) pathway is constitutively activated in BCR-ABL transformed cells and that inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by imatinib mesylate abrogates such activation. We now provide evidence for the existence of a novel regulatory mechanism by which BCR-ABL promotes cell proliferation, involving p70 S6K-mediated suppression of expression of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an inhibitor of cap-dependent translation by blocking the translation initiation factor eIF4A. Our data also establish that second generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors block activation of p70 S6K and downstream engagement of the S6 ribosomal protein in BCR-ABL transformed cells. Moreover, PDCD4 protein expression is up-regulated by inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase in K562 cells and BaF3/BCR-ABL transfectants, suggesting a mechanism for the generation of the proapoptotic effects of such inhibitors. Knockdown of PDCD4 expression results in reversal of the suppressive effects of nilotinib and imatinib mesylate on leukemic progenitor colony formation, suggesting an important role for this protein in the generation of antileukemic responses. Altogether, our studies identify a novel mechanism by which BCR-ABL may promote leukemic cell growth, involving sequential engagement of the mTOR/p70 S6K pathway and downstream suppression of PDCD4 expression.

In studies using the K562, CML-derived, cell line we demonstrate that inhibition of the BCR-ABL/mTOR/p70 S6K pathway results in enhanced protein expression of PDCD4. Similarly, inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity in BaF3 cells stably expressing BCR-ABL or various imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants also results in up-regulation of PDCD4. Importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PDCD4 reverses the suppressive effects of nilotinib (AMN-107) or imatinib mesylate on BCR-ABL-transformed cells, indicating an important role for this protein in the generation of antileukemic responses.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and ReagentsâThe CML-derived K562 cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.

Smith J. Sassano A. Uddin S. Katsoulidis E. Majchrzak B. Kambhampati S. Eklund E.A. Tallman M.S. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Blood. 2005; 106: 2436-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether the mTOR pathway is activated in Ba/F3 cells transformed with various BCR-ABL kinase domain mutants, known to exhibit resistance to imatinib mesylate (52Griswold I.J. MacPartlin M. Bumm T. Goss V.L. O'Hare T. Lee K.A. Corbin A.S. Stoffregen E.P. Smith C. Johnson K. Moseson E.M. Wood L.J. Polakiewicz R.D. Druker B.J. Deininger M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6082-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Constitutive phosphorylation/activation of p70 S6K was observed in native BCR-ABL-transformed cells as well as in cells transformed with the ATP binding loop mutants Y253F and E255K or the H296P and T315I mutants (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this, the S6 ribosomal protein was also constitutively phosphorylated in cells transformed with either native BCR-ABL or the various mutants (Fig. 1B). Treatment of Ba/F3 cells expressing native BCR-ABL with imatinib mesylate resulted in a significant decrease in the phosphorylation/activation of both the p70 S6K (paired p = 0.023) (Fig. 1A) and its substrate, S6 ribosomal protein (paired p = 0.029) (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, phosphorylation/activation of p70 S6K and rpS6 was not decreased in cells expressing E255K and T315I mutants, consistent with the well established resistance of these mutants to the effects of imatinib mesylate (52Griswold I.J. MacPartlin M. Bumm T. Goss V.L. O'Hare T. Lee K.A. Corbin A.S. Stoffregen E.P. Smith C. Johnson K. Moseson E.M. Wood L.J. Polakiewicz R.D. Druker B.J. Deininger M.W. Mol. Cell.

When cells were treated with imatinib mesylate in the presence of rapamycin, there was complete abrogation of phosphorylation of p70 S6K on Thr-389 and the S6 ribosomal protein on Ser-235/236 and Ser-240/244 in both native and E255K BCR-ABL transfectants (Fig. 1C), indicating that rapamycin blocks mTOR activation in cells transformed with imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL kinase mutants.Nilotinib (AMN-107) is a second generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor with known activity against imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants in vitro and in vivo (34O'Hare T.

We examined the effects of this BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor on the activation of components of the mTOR pathway in cells transformed with various BCR-ABL kinase mutants. As expected, treatment of either Ba/F3-BCR-ABL or Ba/F3-BCR-ABL-E255K cells with nilotinib resulted in suppression of cell growth, whereas cells transfected with empty vector were not sensitive to its growth-suppressive effects (Fig. 2A). Nilotinib blocked BCR-ABL-dependent phosphorylation of p70 S6K on Thr-389 and rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser-235/236 and Ser-240/244, in the Y253F, E255K, and H296P mutants (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, nilotinib did not inhibit phosphorylation/activation of p70 S6K in Ba/F3 cells transfected with the T315I mutant (Fig. 2B), consistent with previous work that has established that this mutant is resistant to the effects of nilotinib in vitro and in vivo (30Weisberg E.

The suppression of activation of the p70 S6K pathway was fast, occurring within 30 min of treatment of Ba/F3 transfectants (Fig. 2C). When the cells were treated concomitantly with the BCR-ABL inhibitor and the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, the suppression of 70 S6K activity and phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein in different sites was almost complete (Fig. 2D). Thus, both imatinib mesylate and nilotinib block phosphorylation/activation of the mTOR/p70 S6K in cells expressing native BCR-ABL, whereas nilotinib also blocks such phosphorylation in cells expressing imatinib-resistant mutants, firmly establishing that the engagement of this signaling cascade is BCR-ABL-dependent.FIGURE 2Effects of nilotinib on the phosphorylation/activation status of elements of the mTOR pathway in Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL-resistant mutants.

We show that PTPD1 localizes along actin filaments and at adhesion plaques. PTPD1 forms a stable complex via distinct molecular modules with actin, Src tyrosine kinase, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a scaffold protein kinase enriched at adhesion plaques. Overexpression of PTPD1 promoted cell scattering and migration, short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of endogenous PTPD1, or expression of PTPD1 mutants lacking either catalytic activity (PTPD1C1108S) or the FERM domain (PTPD1Î1-325) significantly reduced cell motility. PTPD1 and Src catalytic activities were both required for epidermal growth factor-induced FAK autophosphorylation at its active site and for downstream propagation of ERK1/2 signaling. Our findings demonstrate that PTPD1 is a component of a multivalent scaffold complex nucleated by FAK at specific intracellular sites. By modulating Src-FAK signaling at adhesion sites, PTPD1 promotes the cytoskeleton events that induce cell adhesion and migration.

Activation of tyrosine kinase receptor by a given growth factor initiates a highly orchestrated signaling cascade involving reversible phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of key cellular substrates. These signaling cascades control major cellular functions, including growth, differentiation, motility, development, and survival (1Bogdan S. Klambt C. Curr.

PTPs act both as inhibitors and enhancers of tyrosine kinase signaling. Several PTPs possess scaffold domains that assemble and target multienzymatic signaling complexes to specific intracellular compartments. Co-localization of PTPs with their substrates increases the rate, magnitude, and specificity of PTP-mediated dephosphorylation of a given target molecule, thus efficiently modulating specific cellular functions (4Alonso A.

PTPD1 cDNA encodes a protein of 1174 amino acids containing an N-terminal sequence homologous to the four-point-one ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM domain) protein family, which includes PTPH1 and PTPMEG1 (Fig. 1A). The FERM motif is a modular structure present within a family of peripheral membrane proteins that link cytoskeleton to plasma membrane. The catalytic domain (PTP) is positioned at the extreme C terminus of PTPD1. An intervening sequence of about 580 residues without apparent homology to known proteins separates the FERM and the PTP domains. PTPD1 regulates signaling induced by Tec family members of membrane receptors (19Jui H.Y. Tseng R.J. Wen X. Fang H.I. Huang L.M. Chen K.Y. Kung H.J. Ann D.K. Shih H.M. J. Biol.

The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 Ã g for 15 min. Cell lysates (1 mg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the anti-HA (2 Î¼g/ml), anti-Src (4 Î¼g/ml), or anti-FAK (4 Î¼g/ml) antibody overnight at 4 Â°C. Protein G-Sepharose (25 Î¼l/sample) was added to the samples and incubated at 4 Â°C for 60 min. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer. Samples of cell lysates (100 Î¼g) and the precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PROTRAN membrane, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. Chemiluminescent (ECL) signals were quantified by scanning densitometry (Amersham Biosciences).GST Pull-down ExperimentsâPTPD1 and its mutants were in vitro synthesized by the TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of 45 Î¼Ci of [35S]methionine. Translated product was incubated overnight with 10 Î¼l of GST or GST-SH2 polypeptides in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with protease inhibitors and 2 mm orthovanadate. The pellets were washed four times in the binding buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and eluted in Laemmli buffer. The eluted samples were resolved in 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed with methanol/acetic acid, enhanced with sodium salicylate, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. GST fusions were visualized by immunoblotting one-fifth of the eluted samples with anti-GST antibody.Immunofluorescence AnalysisâCells were rinsed with PBS and fixed in paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, the cells were incubated with 1Ã phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 60 min at room temperature. Double immunofluorescence was carried out with the following antibodies: TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma), anti-PTPD1 rabbit polyclonal, and anti-FAK. Fluorescein- or rhodamine-tagged anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Technogenetics) secondary antibodies were used. Coverslips were analyzed by confocal microscopy.Cell Migration, Invasion, and Wound Healing AssaysâMigration was assayed in a standard Transwell kit assay (Costar). 1 Ã 105 cells were suspended in migration medium and added to the upper chamber. At selected time points, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min, and stained with crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted and scored. Cell invasion was tested using the Transwell kit assay as described above, with the modification that the polycarbonate membrane was coated with a thin layer of extracellular matrix (Matrigel; Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA). The matrix layer occludes the membrane pores, blocking noninvasive cells from migrating through. Invasive cells, on the other hand, migrate through the matrix layer and cling to the bottom of the polycarbonate membrane. Cells migrated into the membrane were stained with crystal violet and counted. Wound healing assays were performed as follows. Confluent HEK293 cells stably transfected with either empty vector (CMV), PTPD1, or PTPD1C1108S expression vector were scratched with a pipette tip, and cells migrating into the wound were monitored as a function of time.RNA InterferenceâTwo â¼70-bp DNA inserts encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting human PTPD1 (nucleotides 184-204 and 335-355, ATG +1) were subcloned in the pRNA-H1/hygro vectors (GenScript Corp.). A Blast search confirmed that both sequences specifically recognize human PTPD1. A scrambled sequence subcloned in the same vector was used as control. shRNA vectors were transiently transfected using the Lipofectamine protocol. Cells were harvested at 72 h after transfection, and down-regulation of endogenous PTPD1 was monitored by immunoblot analysis with anti-PTPD1 antibody.Hypoosmotic Shock (Lysis Squirting)âHypoosmotic shock was performed as previously described (25Semich R. Robenek H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Human fibroblasts were grown overnight on coverslips. Cells were then rinsed in PIPES buffer (20 mm PIPES, 100 mm KC1, 5 mm MgC12, 3 mm EGTA, pH 6.0) and incubated in a 20% PIPES buffer (a 1:5 dilution of PIPES buffer) for 10 min. This procedure caused osmotic swelling of the cells and destabilization of plasma membranes. Dorsal membranes and most cellular contents were removed with PIPES buffer, pH 7.0. Coverslips were then rapidly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PIPES, pH 7.0, and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis.RESULTSPTPD1 Localizes along Actin Filaments and at Focal Adhesion SitesâPTPD1 contains a FERM domain located at its extreme NH2 terminus that is thought to mediate interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. To determine if PTPD1 associated with actin in situ, we performed immunocytochemical analysis using polyclonal antibodies directed against human PTPD1. The antibody specifically recognized PTPD1, as shown by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B) and immunofluorescence (Fig. 1C). Human fibroblasts were immunostained with anti-PTPD1 antibody, and actin was detected with TRITC-labeled phalloidin. As shown in Fig. 1D (a-c), PTPD1 staining co-localized in part with phalloidin along actin filaments. PTPD1 was also present in membrane extensions and cellular organelles where no actin staining was evident. Serum deprivation for 18 h disassembled actin microfilaments and dispersed phalloidin and PTPD1 signals throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D, d-f).Platelet-derived growth (PDGF) receptor activation is functionally coupled to the small Rho family GTPase, Rac (26Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated Rac induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, formation of stress fibers, and a âring structureâ at internal sites of actin reorganization. We investigated the subcellular location of PTPD1 during actin reorganization. Immunocytochemical analyses in human fibroblasts suggested that PTPD1 dynamically translocates to sites of actin reorganization in response to PDGF treatment (Fig. 1D, g-i). A composite image shows that PTPD1 and actin signals overlap in the same focal plane, suggesting that both proteins are co-localized in intact cells. Treatment with the actin-depolymerizing agent, cytochalasin D, abolished the stress fibers and actin âring structuresâ formed in response to PDGF stimulation and prevented the movement of PTPD1 (Fig. 1D, j-l).Focal adhesions are cellular loci where actin filaments concentrate and create adhesive links between cell membrane and extracellular matrix. Scaffold proteins assemble multifunctional platforms at these structures, where distinct signaling pathways are generated and focused (27Carragher N.O. Frame M.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 241-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 28Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 116: 1409-1416Crossref Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Since PTPD1 co-localizes with actin filaments, we asked if PTPD1 might also be concentrated at adhesion plaques. As shown in Fig. 2A, PTPD1 staining partly overlaps with that of FAK (a-c), a major component of adhesion plaques. To prove that PTPD1 physically interacts with these loci, the cells were lysed by hypoosmotic shock. This procedure disperses cellular membrane, organelles, and actin filaments but leaves some adhesion plaques intact, as shown by immunostaining with anti-FAK antibody (Fig. 2A, d). Treated cells retained some PTPD1 staining, which clearly overlapped with FAK (Fig. 2A, e and f).FIGURE 2PTPD1 localizes at the adhesion sites. A, human fibroblasts were subjected to double immunostaining with the following antibodies: anti-FAK (a) and anti-PTPD1 (b). The cells were subjected to hypoosmotic shock and subsequently immunostained with anti-FAK (d) and anti-PTPD1 (e) antibodies. The right panel (c and f) of each set of images is a merged composite of both signals (red and green). The arrows indicate adhesion plaques. Bar, 5 Î¼m. B, HEK293 cells were serum-deprived overnight, stimulated with EGF for 30 min, and subjected to double immunostaining with anti-PTPD1 (b and e) and anti-FAK (a and d) antibodies. Right panels (c and f) show merge composites of both signals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since PTPD1 modulates EGF signaling, we asked whether EGF stimulation regulates PTPD1 localization. HEK293 cells express functional EGF receptor that couples growth factor signaling to reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and adhesion plaque formation. HEK293 cells were serum-deprived overnight, exposed for 30 min to EGF, and immunostained with anti-FAK and anti-PTPD1 antibodies. Fig. 2B (a-c) shows that PTPD1 and FAK co-localized at adhesion sites. Moreover, some PTPD1 staining was evident at plasma membrane and at actin-enriched sites (Fig. 2B, d-f).PTPD1 Interacts with Actin, Src, and FAKâWe then demonstrated biochemically that actin forms a complex with PTPD1. Cell lysates prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with empty vector (CMV) or with HA-PTPD1 vector were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Fig. 3A shows that anti-HA antibody co-precipitated PTPD1 and actin. Interaction with actin requires the FERM domain; a PTPD1 mutant lacking residues 1-325 (PTPD1Î1-325) failed to pull-down significant amounts of actin.FIGURE 3PTPD1 binds actin and Src. A, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (CMV), HA-PTPD1, or HA-PTPD1Î1-325 vector. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. Aliquots (100 Î¼g) of lysate and precipitates were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-HA and anti-actin antibody. *, antibody heavy chain. B, cell lysates from A were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src antibody. Aliquots (100Î¼g) of cell lysate and precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-HA and anti-Src antibodies. *, antibody heavy chain. C, HEK293 cells were serum-deprived overnight and stimulated with EGF for 30 min. Lysates (1 mg) were subjected to pull down with GST-SH2 polypeptides or immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-PTPD1 antibody. The precipitates were immunoblotted (WB) with the indicated antibodies. D, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-PTPD1 or HA-PTPD1Î1-325 vector, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated with EGF for 30 min. Lysates (1 mg) were subjected to pull down with GST-SH2. The precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-HA (top) and anti-GST (bottom) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although PTPD1 was demonstrated to associate with Src, the interacting domains of the two proteins were not defined (18Moller N.P. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Sures I. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7477-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To identify these domains, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (CMV) or HA-tagged PTPD1 vectors and harvested 24 h later. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Src antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, PTPD1 and Src form a stable complex in the cell extract. In contrast, the PTPD1Î1-325 mutant did not associate with Src. PTPD1 activity was not required for Src binding, since the catalytic inactive mutant of PTPD1 (PTPD1C1108S; see below) was efficiently immunoprecipitated by anti-Src antibody (data not shown).The PTPD1FERM domain contains two highly conserved SH2 binding motifs (Y158ESQ and Y217GEE) that may mediate interaction with Src (29Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 254: 1-13Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We then performed a pull-down assay using GST-SH2 and lysates from HEK293 cells that expressed endogenous PTPD1 (Fig. 3C). Again, PTPD1 was recovered in association with GST-SH2 (Fig. 3C, column 1). We also found that PTPD1 phosphorylation and binding to Src SH2 were regulated by EGF. Thus, serum deprivation decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPD1 by 2-fold and its binding to Src SH2 by 55-60% (Fig. 3C, column 2). Phosphorylation and binding were restored by EGF stimulation (Fig. 3C, column 3). Furthermore, we found that EGF-stimulated SH2 interaction to PTPD1 requires the FERM domain (Fig. 3D).PTPD1 and FAK co-localize at specific subcellular sites, suggesting that both proteins may be part of the same complex in vivo. To demonstrate this association biochemically, lysates from HEK293 cells were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with anti-FAK and anti-PTPD1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A, endogenous PTPD1 and FAK form a stable complex in vivo. These experiments were replicated using an epitope-tagged PTPD1 transgene. Fig. 4B confirmed the interaction between FAK and exogenous HA-tagged PTPD1. Interestingly, a PTPD1 mutant lacking the FERM domain (PTPD1Î1-325) still bound FAK. This implies that Src and FAK bind distinct molecular modules on PTPD1.FIGURE 4PTPD1 interacts with FAK. A, co-immunoprecipitation (Ip) of endogenous PTPD1 and FAK. Lysates (3 mg) from HEK293 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PTPD1 antibody. Precipitates and an aliquot (100 Î¼g) of lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-PTPD1 and anti-FAK antibody. Mouse IgGs were used as control. B, lysates from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with empty vector (CMV), HA-PTPD1, or HA-PTPD1Î1-325 vector were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FAK antibody or with mouse IgG as control.

C, in vitro translated and 35S-labeled PTPD1, PTPD1Î1-325, and PTPD1Î1-581 were incubated for 6 h with lysates (1 mg) from HEK293 and immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody or IgGs as control.

D, in vitro translated and 35S-labeled PTPD1 and PTPD1329-587 were subjected to pull down with GST fused to FERM domain or a carboxyl terminus segment (GST-FRNK) of FAK. GST was used as control. 35S-labeled PTPD1 and PTPD1329-587 were visualized by autoradiography (upper left and right). The presence of GST polypeptides within the precipitates was analyzed by immunoblot (lower left). E, human fibroblasts were transiently transfected with PTPD1Î1-325-GFP (a-c and lower left insets) or PTPD1Î1-600-GFP (d-f) vector. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-FAK antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2071283926,"Atherosclerosis is the underlying pathological process of most cardiovascular disease. A critical component of the âresponse to retentionâ hypothesis of atherogenesis is proteoglycan/low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding. Transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) is present in atherosclerotic lesions, regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proteoglycan synthesis via an unknown signaling pathway, and increases proteoglycan/LDL binding. This pathway was investigated using the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) inhibitor SB431542 and inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase as a possible downstream or alternative mediator. TGF-Î² stimulated and SB431542 inhibited the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. In human VSMC, TGF-Î² increased [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycans associated with a 19% increase in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain size by size exclusion chromatography. SB431542 caused a concentration-dependent decrease in TGF-Î²-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation with 92% inhibition at 3 Î¼m. Two different p38 MAP kinase inhibitors, SB203580 and SB202190, but not the inactive analogue SB202474, concentration-dependently blocked TGF-Î²-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation. TGF-Î² increased [3H]glucosamine incorporation into glycosaminoglycans by 180% and [35S]Met/Cys incorporation into proteoglycan core proteins by 35% with both effects completely inhibited by SB431542. Blocking both Smad2/3 and p38 MAP kinase pathways prevented the effect of TGF-Î² to increase proteoglycan to LDL binding. TGF-Î² mediates its effects on proteoglycan synthesis in VSMCs via the ALK5/Smad2/3 phosphorylation pathway as well as via the p38 MAP kinase signaling cascade.

Chemical Cleavage of GAG ChainsâHuman VSMCs were rendered quiescent and treated in 0.5 ml DMEM, 0.1% FBS with SB431542 (3 Î¼m) under basal conditions and in the presence of TGF-Î² (2 ng/ml) for 4 h prior to the addition of [35S]sulfate (50 Î¼Ci/ml) for a further 24 h. Secreted proteoglycans were harvested, isolated, and concentrated as described previously (20Kawakami S. Arai G. Hayashi T. Fujii Y. Xia G. Kageyama Y. Kihara K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To cleave the GAG chains chemically through a Î²-elimination reaction, pelleted proteoglycans were treated with sodium borohydride (1 m) in NaOH (50 mm) for 24 h at 45 Â°C. The reaction was terminated with glacial acetic acid. Synthesis of Xyloside-initiated GAG ChainsâQuiescent human VSMCs were treated in 0.5 ml DMEM, 0.1% FBS supplemented with methyl Î²-d-xylopyranoside (xyloside) (0.5 mm) with SB431542 (3 Î¼m) under basal conditions in the presence of TGF-Î² (2 ng/ml) for 4 h prior to the addition of [35S]sulfate (50 Î¼Ci/ml) for a further 24 h. Secreted proteoglycans were harvested, isolated, and concentrated as described previously (20Kawakami S. Arai G. Hayashi T. Fujii Y. Xia G. Kageyama Y. Kihara K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Size Analysis of Proteoglycan/GAG Length by SDS-PAGE and Size Exclusion ChromatographyâProteoglycans, cleaved GAG chains, and xyloside-associated GAG chains were sized by SDS-PAGE as described previously (19Nigro J. Dilley R.J. Little P.J. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 162: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cleaved GAG chains and xyloside-associated GAG chains were sized on Sepharose CL-6B columns eluted in guanidine buffer as described previously (21Ballinger M.L. Nigro J. Frontanilla K.V. Dart A.M. Little P.J. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1296-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Data were standardized by calculating Kav values. Thymidine Incorporation into DNAâVSMCs were treated with PDGF (50 ng/ml) and other agents for 16 h, after which time [3H]thymidine (1 Î¼Ci/ml) was added for 3 h at 37 Â°C. Cells were washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (with Ca2+ and Mg2+), incubated on ice for 30 min with 0.2 m HClO4 to precipitate DNA and then washed with HClO4. Cells were digested by the addition of 0.2 m NaOH for 1 h at 37 Â°C, and the reaction was neutralized using 6% acetic acid. Radioactive incorporation was assessed on a liquid scintillation counter. Neutralization of TGF-Î² with anti-TGF-Î²1/2/3 AntibodyâVSMCs were incubated with anti-human-TGF-Î²1/2/3 monoclonal antibody (1-50-fold molar excess) for 40 min prior to treatment with growth factor and radiolabeling to determine the concentration of antibody required to neutralize TGF-Î². Mouse IgG was used as an isotype control. In subsequent experiments, a 20-fold molar excess of anti-TGF-Î²1/2/3 antibody was used. Western BlottingâTotal cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk powder and incubated with anti-phosphorylated Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3) rabbit polyclonal antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-anti-rabbit IgG and ECL detection. Blots from three experiments were quantified by densitometry using NIH ImageJ software. Proteoglycan/LDL Binding by Gel Mobility Shift AssayâHuman VSMCs were cultured, rendered quiescent as described, and treated with SB431542 (3 Î¼m) or SB202190 (10 Î¼m) in the presence of TGF-Î² (2 ng/ml) for 12 h, at which time fresh treatments were added with [35S]Met/Cys (50 Î¼Ci/ml) to radiolabel proteoglycan core proteins (37 Â°C, 24 h). The secreted proteoglycans were harvested and isolated as described and dialyzed into a physiological buffer (20 mm MOPS, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 2mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). Increasing concentrations of LDL (0-0.5 mg/ml) purified from human blood (22Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) were incubated with equal counts (1250 cpm) of proteoglycans for 1 h at 37 Â°C. Samples were run on flat-bed agarose gels (0.7%) as described previously (23Nigro J. Ballinger M. Dilley R. Jennings G. Wight T. Little P. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 2105-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Statistical AnalysisâNormalized data are presented as the mean Â± S.E. of three independent experiments conducted in triplicate unless stated otherwise. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), a two-way ANOVA, or a Student's paired t test as stated. Smad and p38 MAP Kinase-mediated Proteoglycan Synthesis in VSMCâTo determine the extent of TGF-Î²/ALK5-mediated proteoglycan synthesis in human VSMC, we used the ALK5 inhibitor SB431542 (24Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with TGF-Î² (2 ng/ml) in the presence of SB431542 (0-3 Î¼m). SB431542 showed a concentration-dependent decrease of TGF-Î²-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation into secreted proteoglycans (Fig. 1A). [35S]Sulfate incorporation in the presence of TGF-Î² was normalized to 100% for its effect at 10 Î¼m and SB431542 at 3 Î¼m decreased TGF-Î²-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation by 92% (Fig. 1A). The IC50 value was determined to be 0.78 Î¼m (comparable to kinase assay IC50 data from the supplier). SB431542 at 3 Î¼m showed near maximum inhibition with no decrease in cell numbers and was used for subsequent experiments. Separation of proteoglycans on SDS-PAGE showed a concentration-dependent increase in electrophoretic mobility in the presence of SB431542 relative to TGF-Î² treatment alone (Fig. 1B), indicating a concentration-dependent decrease in proteoglycan size upon ALK5 inhibition with SB431542. In the classic TGF-Î² signaling pathway, the effects of TGF-Î² are mediated via phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by ALK5 (11Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). We determined the level of expression of pSmad2/3 protein in whole cell lysates of human VSMC by Western blot. An â¼58-kDa band corresponding to pSmad2/3 was observed in control cells (Fig. 1C, lane 1) indicating the presence of pSmad2/3 under basal conditions. The pSmad2/3 band intensity in TGF-Î² (2 ng/ml)-treated cells (Fig. 1C, lane 3) was increased significantly versus control (24 Â± 5%, p < 0.01), indicating stimulation of Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Treatment with the ALK5 inhibitor SB431542 (3 Î¼m) abolished the pSmad2/3 band in both control cells and TGF-Î²-treated cells. These results demonstrate that in human VSMC SB431542 inhibits phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by ALK5 in the presence of TGF-Î², confirming that SB431542 is able to effectively inhibit the classic TGF-Î² Ser/Thr kinase signaling pathway. Recently p38 MAP kinase was demonstrated to regulate biglycan expression (16Ungefroren H. Groth S. Ruhnke M. Kalthoff H. Fandrich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2644-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether p38 MAP kinase is a mediator of ALK5 signaling in GAG elongation, in our cells we used two inhibitors, SB203580 and SB202190, that specifically block activity of p38 MAP kinase but not ALK5 at concentrations â¤10 Î¼m (25Laping N.J. Grygielko E. Mathur A. Butter S. Bomberger J. Tweed C. Martin W. Fornwald J. Lehr R. Harling J. Gaster L. Callahan J.F. Olson B.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Both inhibitors concentration-dependently blocked TGF-Î²-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation into secreted proteoglycans (Fig. 2A) with a maximum decrease of 50% at 10 Î¼m SB203580 (p < 0.01) and 80% at 10 Î¼m SB202190. There was no significant inhibition observed with the negative control inhibitor SB202474 (Fig. 2A). Separation of proteoglycans on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel showed an increase in electrophoretic mobility of biglycan in the presence of either 10 Î¼m SB203580 or SB202190 relative to TGF-Î² treatment alone (Fig. 2B, lane 3 versus lanes 4/5 and 6/7), indicating that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity by either inhibitor is sufficient to interfere with GAG synthesis in VSMC. To assess whether the change in biglycan size we observed was because of alterations in GAG length, we chemically cleaved the GAG chains from proteoglycan core proteins. In the presence of TGF-Î² the cleaved GAG chains showed a decrease in electrophoretic mobility compared with control, indicating an increased size (Fig. 2C, lane 2 versus 3). Electrophoretic mobility of GAG chains in TGF-Î²-treated cells was inhibited to control levels in the presence of 10 Î¼m SB203580 or 10 Î¼m SB202190 (Fig. 2C). SB202474 had no detectable effect on TGF-Î²-mediated GAG elongation. The results with the p38 inhibitors clearly demonstrate that TGF-Î²-induced GAG elongation in VSMC is dependent on p38 MAP kinase signaling. Taken together with our earlier findings, this indicates that TGF-Î² signals via ALK5/Smad2/3 and p38 MAP kinase to induce GAG elongation in human VSMC. Temporal Effects of SB431542 on TGF-Î²/ALK5-mediated Proteoglycan Synthesis in Human VSMCsâSubsequent experiments focused specifically on ALK5/Smads to determine the extent of changes that signaling via these molecules produces in VSMC proteoglycans. We undertook a time course study of ALK5 inhibition of TGF-Î²-mediated sulfate incorporation. SB431542 (3 Î¼m) decreased TGF-Î² (2 ng/ml)-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation to control levels (Fig. 3A). TGF-Î² caused a decrease in electrophoretic mobility, indicating an increase in proteoglycan size, within 12 h of stimulation (Fig. 3B). No change in the electrophoretic mobility of proteoglycans from TGF-Î²-treated cells was observed in the presence of SB431542 (Fig. 3B, lanes 6-9), suggesting that the action of SB431542 occurs prior to the action of TGF-Î² on proteoglycan synthesis and therefore earlier than 12 h. Effects of TGF-Î² on GAG Synthesis in Human VSMCs Using the ALK5 Inhibitor SB431542 and Glucosamine as an Alternative RadiolabelâUsing the radiolabeled monosaccharide [3H]glucosamine we confirmed the inhibitory effects of SB431542 on VSMC proteoglycans. TGF-Î² (2 ng/ml) caused a 180% increase in [3H]glucosamine incorporation compared with control (p < 0.01) indicating an increase in GAG synthesis. SB431542 (3 Î¼m) decreased basal [3H]glucosamine incorporation by 43% and TGF-Î²-mediated [3H]glucosamine incorporation by 72% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A) indicating inhibition of ALK5-mediated GAG synthesis of VSMC proteoglycans. TGF-Î² Increases Proteoglycan Core Protein Synthesis via the ALK/Smad2/3 Pathwayâ[35S]Met/Cys incorporation was assessed to investigate changes in total proteoglycan core protein synthesis. TGF-Î² increased [35S]Met/Cys incorporation by 35% compared with control (p < 0.01) indicating an increase in core protein synthesis. SB431542 (3 Î¼m) decreased basal [35S]Met/Cys incorporation by 12% and TGF-Î²-mediated [35S]Met/Cys incorporation by 27% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B) indicating inhibition of ALK5-mediated proteoglycan core protein synthesis. Inhibition of ALK5 Blocks TGF-Î²-induced GAG Elongation Dependently and Independently of Proteoglycan Core ProteinsâTo assess whether the changes in proteoglycan size that we observed were specifically because of alterations in GAG length, we chemically cleaved the GAG chains from proteoglycan core proteins. The electrophoretic mobility of cleaved GAG chains was greater compared with complete proteoglycans (Fig. 5A). In the presence of TGF-Î² the cleaved GAG chains showed a decrease in electrophoretic mobility compared with control, indicating an increased size. Electrophoretic mobility of GAG chains in TGF-Î²-treated cells was inhibited to control levels in the presence of 3 Î¼m SB431542 (Fig. 5A). These changes were definitively evaluated by size exclusion chromatography. A representative size exclusion analysis experiment is shown where the vertical line represents the mean Kav of GAG chains from control cells (Fig. 5B). GAG chains from TGF-Î²-treated cells have a Kav value of 0.39 Â± 0.01 compared with control (p < 0.01), where Kav is 0.42 Â± 0.01, indicating TGF-Î²-mediated GAG elongation. Inhibition of ALK5 with SB431542 resulted in a Kav of 0.44 Â± 0.02 compared with TGF-Î² treatment alone (p < 0.02), indicating that SB435142 inhibited TGF-Î² stimulation of GAG elongation. We used Î²-d-xyloside (an initiator of GAG synthesis) to examine GAG synthesis independently of core protein synthesis. TGF-Î² (2 ng/ml) increased [35S]sulfate incorporation by 169% compared with control (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A). SB431542 (3 Î¼m) decreased basal [35S]sulfate incorporation by 24% and TGF-Î²-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation by 64% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A). Xyloside-initiated GAG chains were separated by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic mobility of xyloside-initiated proteoglycans in the presence of TGF-Î² was reduced compared with control (Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 4). Inhibition of ALK5 by SB431542 prevented the effect of TGF-Î² on proteoglycan synthesis and had the same electrophoretic mobility when compared with control (Fig. 6B, lane 5). Complete proteoglycans also may be seen at the top of the gel. As determined by size exclusion chromatography, xyloside-initiated GAG chains from TGF-Î²-treated cells have a Kav value of 0.52 Â± 0.02 compared with control cells (p < 0.05) which have a Kav of 0.62 Â± 0.01 (p < 0.05), demonstrating an increase in GAG length in the presence of TGF-Î². Treatment with SB431542 resulted in a Kav of 0.60 compared with TGF-Î² treatment alone (p < 0.05), verifying that SB435142 inhibited TGF-Î²-mediated stimulation of GAG synthesis. SB431542 Inhibits PDGF-mediated GAG Synthesis but Not VSMC ProliferationâTo examine the specificity of SB431542, we evaluated its action on the tyrosine kinase growth factor, PDGF. It was expected that at the concentration specific for ALK5 inhibition (3 Î¼m), there would be no effect on PDGF. PDGF (50 ng/ml) stimulated [35S]sulfate incorporation by 82% relative to control (p < 0.01) (Fig. 7). Treatment of cells with SB431542 (0-3 Î¼m) showed a concentration-dependent decrease of PDGF-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation into secreted proteoglycans (Fig. 7A) with a maximum decrease of 60% at 3 Î¼m (p < 0.01). Imatinib, a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (26Buchdunger E. Cioffi C.L. Law N. Stover D. Ohno-Jones S. Druker B.J. Lydon N.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 139-145PubMed Google Scholar) that inhibits PDGF-mediated GAG elongation, 3M. L. Ballinger and P. J. Little, unpublished observations. was used as a positive control and inhibited PDGF-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation by 97% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 7A). Separation of proteoglycans on SDS-PAGE showed a concentration-dependent increase in electrophoretic mobility in the presence of SB431542 relative to PDGF treatment alone (Fig. 7B), indicating a concentration-dependent decrease in proteoglycan size upon treatment with SB431542. The effect on VSMC mitogenic response as a classic PDGF cellular action was assessed to investigate whether SB431542 would inhibit PDGFR-mediated responses (Fig. 7C). PDGF caused a 170% increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with control (p < 0.01). No change in [3H]thymidine incorporation was observed in the presence of SB431542, indicating that SB431542 does not block the PDGFR and is not a PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Genistein, used here as a positive control, inhibited PDGF-mediated [3H]thymidine incorporation by 92% (p < 0.01). PDGF is known to mediate TGF-Î² release from VSMCs (27Agrotis A. Saltis J. Bobik A. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PDGF mediates the release of a functional amount of TGF-Î², we used a neutralizing antibody to block the effects of any TGF-Î². Cells were incubated with anti-TGF-Î²1/2/3 antibody (1-50-fold molar excess) in the presence of TGF-Î² (2 ng/ml) to generate a concentration inhibition curve (Fig. 8A). At both 10- and 50-fold molar excess, the anti-TGF-Î² antibody inhibited TGF-Î²-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycans (p < 0.01) (Fig. 8A). Mouse IgG, used as an isotype control, had no effect on TGF-Î²-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation as expected. The anti-TGF-Î² antibody (50-fold molar excess) showed no effect under basal conditions (Fig. 8A). The effect of the antibody at 20-fold molar excess was assessed against PDGF to investigate potential PDGF-mediated TGF-Î² release from VSMCs. The antibody showed no effect under basal conditions. The antibody decreased PDGF (50 ng/ml)-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation by 24% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 8B), suggesting that such a TGF-Î² release may contribute to the action of PDGF on proteoglycan synthesis in VSMCs. The antibody was used with TGF-Î² as a positive control and was found to decrease TGF-Î²-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation by 40% (Fig. 8B). Effects of the antibody on [35S]sulfate incorporation are mirrored on an SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 8C). SB431542 (3 Î¼m) decreased PDGF-mediated [35S]sulfate incorporation by 57% (Fig. 8B) and increased electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 8C). The presence of SB431542 and the antibody together in PDGF-treated cells did not decrease [35S]sulfate incorporation any further (Fig. 8B). The data indicate that SB431542 inhibits PDGF-mediated proteoglycan synthesis in VSMCs and may inhibit an autocrine effect of TGF-Î² released following PDGF stimulation. Inhibition of ALK5 and p38 MAP Kinase Reduces LDL Binding to Proteoglycans from TGF-Î²-treated Human VSMCsâGel mobility shift assays were performed to assess proteoglycan-LDL binding. Proteoglycans derived from cells treated with SB431542 (3 Î¼m) under basal conditions had similar LDL binding to control proteoglycans (data not shown). However, proteoglycans derived from SB431542-treated cells in the presence of TGF-Î² had a decreased binding to LDL compared with TGF-Î² treatment alone (p < 0.001) with half maximal saturation values of 50 and 25 Î¼g/ml LDL, respectively (Fig. 9A). Similarly, proteoglycans from SB202190-treated cells in the presence of TGF-Î² exhibited decreased LDL binding compared with TGF-Î² treatment (p < 0.05) (Fig. 9B), indicating that inhibition of TGF-Î²-mediated signaling via ALK5/Smad2/3 or p38 MAP kinase results in proteoglycans with a decreased propensity to bind LDL. A TGF-Î²-activated Smad2/3 phosphorylation pathway is present in human internal mammary artery-derived VSMCs and, along with p38 MAP kinase signaling, is responsible for the TGF-Î²-mediated elongation of GAG chains on proteoglycans. Inhibiting Smad2/3 phosphorylation with SB431542 antagonized the GAG elongation action of TGF-Î², and inhibition of p38 kinase also blocked TGF-Î²-mediated GAG elongation. Further investigation revealed that SB431542 partially inhibited the GAG elongation action of another atherogenic growth factor, PDGF. However, we demonstrated that this latter action was likely due to the PDGF-stimulated autocrine secretion of functional levels of TGF-Î² and that SB431542 has no direct action to inhibit a classic PDGFR-mediated response such as VSMC proliferation (28Little P.J. Allen T.J. Hashimura K. Nigro J. Farrelly C.A. Dilley R.J. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2003; 59: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Finally, inhibition of phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and p38 MAP kinase with SB431542 and SB202190, respectively, reversed TGF-Î²-mediated increases in proteoglycan/LDL binding. TGF-Î² is a secreted cytokine that controls a plethora of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, extracellular matrix production, and immune functions (9Wrana J.L.

TGF-Î² stimulates the synthesis of elongated GAG chains on VSM proteoglycans (7Little P.J. Tannock L. Olin K.L. Chait A. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elongation of GAG chains on VSM proteoglycans is of particular interest in cardiovascular disease because it leads to enhanced binding of proteoglycans to lipoproteins on LDL (7Little P.J. Tannock L. Olin K.L. Chait A. Wight T.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Ballinger M.L. Nigro J. Frontanilla K.V. Dart A.M. Little P.J. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1296-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has been shown definitively that, in the early stages of human atherosclerosis, the pathological process begins with lipid deposition in the basal layers of diffuse intimal thickenings (6Nakashima Y. Fujii H. Sumiyoshi S. Wight T.N. Sueishi K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the lipid deposition described in early atherosclerotic lesions occurs in association with enrichment of the proteoglycan biglycan (6Nakashima Y. Fujii H. Sumiyoshi S. Wight T.N. Sueishi K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). As such, proteoglycan synthesis, and specifically GAG synthesis, represents a potential therapeutic target (6Nakashima Y. Fujii H. Sumiyoshi S. Wight T.N. Sueishi K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 21Ballinger M.L. Nigro J. Frontanilla K.V. Dart A.M. Little P.J. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1296-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recent advances in elucidation of TGF-Î² signaling pathways may provide insights into possible therapeutic strategies for the future (18Gaedeke J. Noble N.A. Border W.A. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 112-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The use of small specific inhibitors developed for therapeutics can be a powerful tool in dissecting complex signal transduction pathways (31DaCosta Byfield S. Major C. Laping N.J. Roberts A.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 744-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This study focused on TGF-Î² signaling by the use of a potent ALK5 inhibitor, SB431542 (31DaCosta Byfield S. Major C. Laping N.J. Roberts A.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 744-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). SB431542 also inhibits the ALK4 and ALK7 receptors, which are highly related to ALK5 in their kinase domains, but it has no effect on any of the other ALKs (24Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). SB431542 acts by competitively inhibiting ATP binding. It inhibits TGF-Î²- and activin-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which is mediated by ALK4/5/7 (24Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). SB431542 has previously been shown to prevent TGF-Î²-induced gene expression of collagen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and connective tissue growth factor (32Mori Y. Ishida W. Bhattacharyya S.

Future studies will enable us to obtain a clearer picture of the effects of this inhibitor on gene transcriptional events related to proteoglycans in VSM. Our findings show SB431542 to be useful as a novel experimental tool for gaining understanding of TGF-Î² signaling leading to proteoglycan synthesis in VSMCs. Further studies using antibodies to individual Smads or a commercially available inhibitor of ALK5-mediated Smad3 phosphorylation will further define and delineate these signaling pathways. Very little is known about the signaling biochemistry operating between cell surface receptors and the ultimate changes in GAG synthesis and structure. PDGF stimulates GAG elongation and the expression of mRNA for proteoglycan core proteins, but only the increased expression of the core protein versican is blocked by the broad spectrum protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (30Schonherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schonherr E. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Arch. Biochem.

Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2003; 59: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The fact that GAG elongation stimulated by PDGF is not blocked by genistein suggests that a novel signaling pathway dependent upon the PDGFR but independent of its tyrosine kinase activity is responsible for mediating GAG elongation in VSMCs. This observation generated our interest in the signaling pathway by which TGF-Î² stimulated GAG elongation in VSMCs, which revealed that TGF-Î²-mediated GAG elongation proceeds via a known ALK5 and Smad2/3 pathway. In VSMC TGF-Î²-mediated activation of p38 MAP kinase has been shown to induce expression of thrombospondin (34McGillicuddy F.C. O'Toole D. Hickey J.A. Gallagher W.M. Dawson K.A. Keenan A.K. Vascul.

Although TGF-Î² has been demonstrated to regulate biglycan expression via p38 MAP kinase in the pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line PANC-1 (16Ungefroren H. Groth S. Ruhnke M. Kalthoff H. Fandrich F.

Using two p38 MAP kinase inhibitors at concentrations that enable highly specific inhibition, the results clearly demonstrate a role for p38 MAP kinase in TGF-Î² signaling in ALK5-mediated GAG synthesis. We observed inhibition of GAG chain elongation by both the Smad inhibitor and the p38 inhibitors. It remains an interesting question as to the relationship between Smad2/3 and p38 MAP kinase, particularly whether or not p38 MAP kinase is downstream and therefore Smad-dependent or is otherwise a Smad-independent pathway. A recent report in human cardiac fibroblasts has shown that TGF-Î² induction of GAG synthesis occurs through both ALK5 and p38 signaling (37Prante C. Milting H. Kassner A. Farr M. Ambrosius M.

Further studies will facilitate the identification of the signaling intermediates that dictate TGF-Î²-mediated effects on proteoglycans in VSMCs, including the possible downstream association of p38 MAP kinase to upstream Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Although molecular manipulations that interfere with TGF-Î² signaling lead to deleterious actions on the immune system in animal models, there are very little data available on the impact of small molecule TGF-Î² inhibitors (38Agrotis A. Kalinina N. Bobik A. Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2005; 3: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Compared with the molecular genetics approach, these agents may either be more specific in their action or indeed favorably less efficacious in inhibiting TGF-Î² signaling. Small molecule inhibitors provide an opportunity to evaluate the potential of inhibiting growth factor signaling pathways for the prevention of changes in the synthesis and structure of VSMC proteoglycans. The data provided in this paper indicate that a suitable TGF-Î² signaling inhibitor should be evaluated for its potential to prevent lipid deposition and atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1976859893,"The Shaker family voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv1) assemble with cytosolic beta-subunits (Kvbeta) to form a stable complex. All Kvbeta subunits have a conserved core domain, which in one of them (Kvbeta2) is an aldoketoreductase that utilizes NADPH as a cofactor. In addition to this core, Kvbeta1 has an N terminus that closes the channel by the N-type inactivation mechanism. Point mutations in the putative catalytic site of Kvbeta1 alter the on-rate of inactivation. Whether the core of Kvbeta1 functions as an enzyme and whether its enzymatic activity affects N-type inactivation had not been explored. Here, we show that Kvbeta1 is a functional aldoketoreductase and that oxidation of the Kvbeta1-bound cofactor, either enzymatically by a substrate or non-enzymatically by hydrogen peroxide or NADP(+), induces a large increase in open channel current. The modulation is not affected by deletion of the distal C terminus of the channel, which has been suggested in structural studies to interact with Kvbeta. The rate of increase in current, which reflects NADPH oxidation, is approximately 2-fold faster at 0-mV membrane potential than at -100 mV. Thus, cofactor oxidation by Kvbeta1 is regulated by membrane potential, presumably via voltage-dependent structural changes in Kv1.1 channels."

An increasing number of studies demonstrate proliferative effects of membrane ion channels (1Wang Z. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 448: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Voltage-gated K+ channels and other types of K+ channels are expressed in numerous types of tumors, where they may serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers and potential drug targets (2Pardo L.A.

Eag1 channels are probably necessary for progression through the G1 phase and G0/G1 transition of the cell cycle (5Wonderlin W.F. Strobl J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 91-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrates the hyperpolarizing effects of Eag1 and other Kv channels on the membrane voltage of T84 cells, which supports intracellular pH regulation and Ca2+ increase necessary for proliferation (6Spitzner M. Ousingsawat J. Scheidt K. Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the role of Ca2+-activated Clâ channels in cell proliferation (7Kunzelmann K. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 205: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This may be due to the ongoing controversy regarding the molecular nature of Ca2+-activated Clâ channels (8Kunzelmann K. Milenkovic V.M. Spitzner M. Barro Soria R. Schreiber R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; 454: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A family of putative Ca2+-activated Clâ channels has been identified that also controls cell-cell adhesion, apoptosis, and the cell cycle. However, the structure and biophysical properties of these channels are poorly understood (9Pauli B.U. Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Gruber A.D. Archibald H.A. Elble R.C. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol.

Recent studies defined bestrophin proteins as bona fide Ca2+-activated Clâ channels. The Clâ currents generated upon expression of bestrophin show many of the properties found for native Ca2+-activated Clâ currents (11Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 99: 4008-4013Crossref Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 12Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Tsunenari T.

However, bestrophins have also been proposed to function as regulators of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (14Rosenthal R. Bakall B. Kinnick T. Peachey N. Wimmers S. Wadelius C. Marmorstein A.D. Strauss O. FASEB J. 2005; 20: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our own ongoing work in epithelial cells supports both concepts, in that bestrophins may form part of a Clâ channel complex or may couple intracellular Ca2+ signals to Clâ channels of unknown molecular identity (15Barro Soria R. Spitzner M. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17460-17467Google Scholar). In the present report we demonstrate that both voltage-gated Eag1 K+ channels and bestrophin 1 (Best1) Clâ channels support proliferation of fast-growing T84 colonic carcinoma cells. The fast-growing T84 cell clone was obtained through spontaneous transformation of slow-growing T84 cells. In contrast to slow-growing T84 cells, transformed cells do not form polarized monolayers and show a remarkable up-regulation of Eag1 and Best1 expression. We demonstrate that both currents are in charge of enhanced cell proliferation. Cell Culture and Proliferation StudiesâHuman colorectal carcinoma epithelial T84 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 5% CO2 and 37 Â°C. Cells were seeded on fibronectin (Invitrogen)/collagen (Cellon)-coated glass coverslips or permeable supports (Snapwell, Costar). Typically these cells grow slowly as polarized monolayers (T84-slow). Because of spontaneous transformation, a T84 cell line was selected that grew remarkably faster (T84-fast). For proliferation assays, cells were plated at a density of 2000 cells/0.35 cm2 and incubated 2 days later with either niflumic acid (0.01â100 mm) or astemizole (0.5â5000 nm). Cell proliferation was assessed by 5-bromo-2â²-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) 3The abbreviations used are: BrdUrd5-bromo-2â²-deoxyuridineRNAiRNA interferencesiRNAsmall interfering RNAFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterRTreverse transcriptionNFAniflumic acidDIDS4,4â²-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2â²-disulfonic acidANOVAanalysis of varianceeG1early G1 phase. incorporation using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) and cell counting. The cell number was assessed after fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and after staining with Mayer's hemalaun (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 5 min. Digitized microscopic images were taken (Fluovert FS, Leitz), and nuclei were counted using imaging software (TINA version 2.09g). Toxicity of the blockers was assessed using trypan blue (Sigma).

Cell Cycle, FACS Analysis, Caspase Assay, and RT-PCRâCells were synchronized into early G1 by 24-h serum starvation. Incubation in thymidine (2 mm) (Sigma) halted the cells at G1/S transition. 36-h treatment with demecolcine (0.05 Î¼g/ml) (Sigma) synchronized cells into M phase. Synchronization was verified by FACS (COULTER EPICSÂ® XL-MCL, Beckman) using propidium iodide staining of the DNA (Sigma). Apoptosis was analyzed after 8- and 24-h incubation with the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (1 Î¼m) (Sigma) and with detection of cleaved caspase-3 in Western blots using rabbit anti-human caspase-3 antibody (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA). For RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA II columns (Macherey-Nagel, DuÌren, Germany). 1 Î¼g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 37 Â°C using random primer and RT (Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, Promega, Mannheim, Germany). For PCR, the following primers were used: hEag1 (KCNH1, GenBankâ¢ accession number NM_002238), 5â²-CGCATGAACTACCTGAAGACG-3â² (sense) and 5â²-TCTGTGGATGGGGCGATGTTC-3â² (antisense), 560 bp; and hBest1 (VMD2, GenBankâ¢ accession number NM_004183), 5â²-CTGCTCTGCTACTACATCATC-3â² (sense) and 5â²-GTGTCCACACTGAGTACGC-3â² (antisense), 552 bp. The conditions were 94 Â°C for 2 min and 35 cycles of 94 Â°C for 30 s, 58 Â°C for 30 s, and 72 Â°C for 1 min. PCR products were visualized by loading on 2% agarose gels and verified by sequencing. Down-regulation of Best1 and Eag1 Expression by RNAiâThree different batches (A, B, and C) of duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAi with a 3â²-overhanging TT were purchased from Invitrogen. The sense strands of the RNAi used to silence the Best1 gene were 5â²-AAUUCCUGUCGACAAUCCAGUUGGU-3â² (A), 5â²-AUCUCAUCCACAGCCAACAGGGACA-3â² (B), and 5â²-UAAAUAAAGCGGAUGAUGUAGUAGC-3â² (C). RNAi sequences for Eag1 are shown in Ref. 6Spitzner M. Ousingsawat J. Scheidt K. Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar. Fluorophore-labeled RNAi and exposure to the transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) served as controls. After 48 h, cells were further processed in proliferation assays for Western blotting. Detection of Eag1 and Best1 by Western BlottingâT84 cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (150 mmol/liter NaCl, 50 mmol/liter Tris, 100 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture) (Sigma). Equal amounts of total protein (50 Î¼g) were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond-P (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany), and incubated with either rabbit anti-human Kv10.1 (Eag1) (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) or rabbit anti-human VMD2 (Best1) (15Barro Soria R. Spitzner M. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17460-17467Google Scholar) antibodies. Proteins were visualized using goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Acris Antibodies, Hiddenhausen, Germany) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were detected by a Fluor-STM MultiImager (Bio-Rad). Measurement of the Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration and Cell VolumeâT84 cells were loaded with 2 Î¼m Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) with 2.5 mm probenecid for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescence was detected in cells perfused with Ringer's solution containing 2.5 mm probenecid (Sigma) at 37 Â°C using an inverted microscope (IMT-2, Olympus, NuÌrnberg, Germany) and a high speed polychromator system (VisiChrome, Puchheim, Germany). Fura-2 was excited at 340/380 nm, and emission was recorded between 470 and 550 nm using a charge-coupled device camera (CoolSnap HQ, Visitron). [Ca2+]i was calculated from the 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio after background subtraction. The formula used to calculate [Ca2+]i was [Ca2+]i = Kd Ã (RâRmin)(RmaxâR) Ã (Sf2/Sb2), where R is the observed fluorescence ratio. The values Rmax and Rmin (maximum and minimum ratios) and the constant Sf2/Sb2 (fluorescence of free and Ca2+-bound Fura-2 at 380 nm) were calculated using 2 Î¼mol/liter ionomycin (Calbiochem), 5 Î¼mol/liter nigericin, 10 Î¼mol/liter monensin (Sigma), and 5 mmol/liter EGTA to equilibrate intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ in intact Fura-2-loaded cells. The dissociation constant for the Fura-2Â·Ca2+ complex was taken as 224 nmol/liter. Patch ClampingâCell culture dishes were mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (IM35, Zeiss) and perfused continuously (37 Â°C) with Ringer's solution. Patch clamp experiments were performed in the fast and slow whole cell configuration. Patch pipettes had an input resistance of 2â4 megaohms when filled with a solution containing 30 mm KCl, 95 mm potassium gluconate, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 4.8 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.758 mm calcium gluconate, 1.034 mm MgCl2, 5 mm d-glucose, and 3 mm ATP. pH was adjusted to 7.2; Ca2+ activity was 0.1 Î¼m. The access conductance was monitored continuously and was 60â120 nanosiemens. Currents (voltage clamp) and voltages (current clamp) were recorded using an EPC7 amplifier (HEKA, Darmstadt, Germany), an LH1600 interface and PULSE software (HEKA), and Chart software (ADInstruments, Spechbach, Germany). In intervals, membrane voltages were clamped in steps of 10 mV fromâ50 to +50 mV relative to resting potential. Membrane conductance Gm was calculated from the measured current (I) and clamped membrane voltage values according to Ohm's law. Cell volume was measured directly by a Zeiss Axiovert 200M/ApoTome microscope using Axiovision software or was assessed by fluorescence measurements in calcein (2 Î¼m; Molecular Probes)-loaded cells at an excitation of 500 nm and emission of 520â550 nm. The experiments were done in the presence of 2.5 mm probenecid. The control isotonic solution (290 mosm) was prepared by adding 120 mm mannitol. The hypotonic (170 mosm) and control isotonic solutions contained 85 mm NaCl. Materials and Statistical AnalysisâAll compounds used were of the highest purity grade available. Astemizole, niflumic acid (NFA), DIDS, tetrapentylammonium, carbachol, and ATP were all from Sigma. Student's t test (for paired or unpaired samples as appropriate) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical analysis. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. Fast-growing Colonic Carcinoma Cells (T84-fast) Express Eag1 and Best1âT84 cells typically grow in slowly expanding patches (T84-slow). At passage number 73, the cell line spontaneously changed its growth pattern, i.e. the cells grew remarkably faster (T84-fast) as single cells, non-polarized and above each other (Fig. 1, A and B). T84-slow cells formed tight mono-layers with a transepithelial resistance of 2.2 Â± 0.3 kiloohms Ã cm2 (n = 25) when grown on permeable supports, whereas T84-fast cells did not (0.12 Â± 0.07 kiloohms Ã cm2; n = 23). Thus, growth pattern or phenotype was not changed by the way the cells were grown. We examined apoptosis in both cell lines by Western blotting and analyzed uncleaved and cleaved caspase-3. Small amounts of cleaved caspase-3 were detected in T84-slow, but not in T84-fast, cells after treatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (1 Î¼m) (Fig. 1C). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed for voltage-gated K+ channels (Eag1) and putative Ca2+-activated Clâ channels (Best1) using Î²-actin as an internal standard. Densitometric analysis suggested transcript numbers for Eag1 and Best1 that were at least 10 times higher in T84-fast cells. Thus much higher protein expression was found for Eag1 and Best1 in T84-fast cells in Western blots (Fig. 1D). The membrane conductance properties were analyzed in T84-slow and T84-fast cells in whole cell patch clamp experiments, and membrane voltages were measured in the current clamp mode. T84-slow cells (n = 8) were more hyperpolarized (â51.7 Â± 5.6 mV) and had a lower base-line conductance (3.8 Â± 0.7 nanosiemens) than T84-fast cells (â36.6 Â± 2.9 mV and 23.8 Â± 2.9 nanosiemens, n = 8). The increased base-line conductance and depolarized membrane voltages of T84-fast cells were due to higher activity of Clâ channels because replacement of extracellular Clâ by gluconate (5Cl) shifted the I/V curve to more positive clamp voltages. This was not observed for T84-slow cells (Fig. 1E). Eag1 Controls Proliferation of Fast- but Not Slow-growing T84 CellsâEag1 has been demonstrated to support proliferation of several different cell types (6Spitzner M. Ousingsawat J. Scheidt K. Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Pardo L.A. Contreras-Jurado C. Zientkowska M. Alves F. Stuhmer W. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 205: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We therefore examined if high expression levels of Eag1 correlate with increased proliferation of T84-fast cells. To that end, T84-slow and T84-fast cells were treated with three different batches (AâC) of siRNA for Eag1. Incubation of the cells with either fluorescently labeled scrambled oligos or lipid (transfection reagent) and nontreated cells served as controls. Measurement of BrdUrd incorporation clearly indicates inhibition of proliferation of T84-fast cells after treatment with siRNA for Eag1 (Fig. 2A). siRNA treatment of T84-slow cells did not affect cell proliferation, suggesting a proliferative function of Eag1 only in T84-fast cells. Notably, Eag1 expression was significantly up-regulated by the readdition of 10% fetal calf serum in serum-starved cells (data not shown). Using the inhibitor astemizole (5 Î¼m), we examined the contribution of Eag1 to whole cell currents measured in T84-slow and T84-fast cells. Astemizole inhibited whole cell currents in both cell types; however, the effect was more pronounced in T84-fast cells, and thus astemizole-sensitive whole cell currents were significantly larger in T84-fast cells (Fig. 2, B and C). The normalized conductance/voltage relationship for Eag1 (astemizole-sensitive whole cell conductances) was not different for T84-fast (solid line) and T84-slow (dashed line) cells (Fig. 2D). A previous report (6Spitzner M. Ousingsawat J. Scheidt K. Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) supplied evidence that hyperpolarized Eag1 currents assist in the increase of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) when cells are stimulated with secretagogues (such as ATP and carbachol) or mitogens and may thereby support proliferation. Both Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum stores and Ca2+ influx through store-operated Ca2+ channels depend on Kv channel function as reported earlier (6Spitzner M. Ousingsawat J. Scheidt K. Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We compared the increase in [Ca2+]i in Fura-2-loaded T84-slow and T84-fast cells upon stimulation with ATP (100 Î¼m). ATP binds to purinergic P2Y2 receptors and thereby induces a peak and plateau [Ca2+]i increase in both cell lines (Fig. 2E). The peak [Ca2+]i increase was doubled in T84-fast cells when compared with T84-slow cells, which suggests a role of Eag1 in Ca2+ signaling in T84-fast cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Enhanced Ca2+ signaling is not due to an increased expression of the abundant purinergic receptor P2Y2 in T84-fast cells. In contrast, P2Y2 expression was slightly higher in T84-slow cells (Fig. 2G). Eag1 Activity in T84-fast Cells Is Cell Cycle-dependentâIn other cell types Eag1 activity varies during the cell cycle (16Pardo L.A. Contreras-Jurado C. Zientkowska M. Alves F. Stuhmer W. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 205: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined cell cycle dependence of Eag1 in T84-fast cells. Cells were synchronized in early G1 (eG1), G1/S, or M phase (see âMaterials and Methodsâ), and synchronization was verified by FACS analysis (Fig. 3A). We found that astemizole-sensitive whole cell currents were augmented in cells synchronized in G1/S when compared with eG1 or M phase (Fig. 3B). T84 cells also express other voltage-gated K+ channels such as Kv1.5 and Kv3.4, which are blocked by the inhibitor tetrapentylammonium (6Spitzner M. Ousingsawat J. Scheidt K. Kunzelmann K.

However, in contrast to Eag1, tetrapentylammonium-sensitive whole cell currents were not cell cycle-dependent (data not shown). We further compared the increase in [Ca2+]i in T84-fast cells synchronized in eG1 and G1/S phase. Both peak and plateau [Ca2+]i increases were significantly enhanced in G1/S cells. Moreover, the Eag1 blocker astemizole inhibited peak and plateau [Ca2+]i increases in both cell cycle phases, but the effect of astemizole on plateau [Ca2+]i was augmented in the G1/S phase (Fig. 3C). These results supply evidence for cell cycle-regulated Eag1 currents in T84-fast cells and cell cycle-dependent effects of Eag1 on Ca2+ signaling. Best1 Controls Proliferation of Fast- but Not Slow-growing T84 CellsâBecause T84-fast cells show much higher expression of Best1 when compared with T84-slow cells (Fig. 4A), we examined the effect of this putative Ca2+-activated Clâ channel on cell proliferation. T84-slow and T84-fast cells were treated with three different batches (AâC) of siRNA for Best1, which reduced Best1 levels in T84-fast cells. Expression levels in T84-slow cells were already very low, so more protein was loaded on the gel as indicated by the Î²-actin signal (Fig. 4, A and B). Incubation of the cells with either fluorescently labeled scrambled oligos or transfection reagent (lipid) and non-treated cells served as controls. Measurement of BrdUrd incorporation clearly indicates inhibition of proliferation of T84-fast cells after treatment with siRNA for Best1 (Fig. 4C). No effects of siRNA were seen in T84-slow cells, suggesting a proliferative function of Best1 only in T84-fast cells. In whole cell patch clamp experiments, the high base-line conductance found in T84-fast cells could be partially inhibited by the blockers of Ca2+-activated Clâ channels, NFA and DIDS (both 100 Î¼m). Neither inhibitor had an effect in T84-slow cells (Fig. 5A). Stimulation with ATP (100 Î¼m) to increase intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2D) activated a whole cell current in T84-slow, but not in T84-fast, cells (Fig. 5B). In T84-slow cells, ATP activated primarily a K+ conductance as indicated by the hyperpolarizing effect of ATP on the membrane voltage (Fig. 5C). Few effects of ATP were seen in T84-fast cells. Correspondingly, replacement of extracellular Clâ by impermeable gluconate (5Cl) showed no effects in T84-slow cells but reduced the baseline conductance in T84-fast cells (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results suggest active Best1 Clâ channels in non-stimulated T84-fast cells, which cause enhanced proliferation. Increased Proliferation and Clâ Conductance in Best1-transfected T84-slow CellsâTo further demonstrate that Best1 contributes to proliferation of T84 cells, we expressed human Best1 in T84-slow cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, transfection of 100 ng of exogenous Best1 increased Best1 expression in T84-slow cells almost to the level found in T84-slow cells. No change was seen in mock-transfected cells. Notably, overexpression of Best1 changed the growth pattern of T84-slow cells toward that found for T84-fast cells (Fig. 6B). Moreover, after expression of Best1, a DIDS-sensitive whole cell current appeared in T84-slow cells that was not found in mock-transfected or parental cells (Fig. 6C). Measurement of the BrdUrd incorporation indicated a significant increase in proliferation of Best1-transfected T84-slow cells that was not observed for mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6D). In summary, both Eag1 K+ channels and Best1 Clâ channels are up-regulated in spontaneously transformed T84 cells, where they augment proliferation. Eag1 and Best1 Support Intracellular Ca2+ Signaling and Volume Regulation, RespectivelyâEag1 K+ channels (and to some degree Best1) have a clear impact on intracellular Ca2+ signaling. This was demonstrated by stimulation with ATP (100 Î¼m), which increased intracellular peak (endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release) and plateau (Ca2+ influx through store-operated Ca2+ channels) increases in T84-fast cells. Treatment with siRNA for Eag1 significantly reduced peak and plateau Ca2+ increases (Fig. 7A). Volume measurements indicate stronger cell swelling and potent regulatory volume decrease in T84-fast when compared with T84-slow cells, as identified by direct volume measurements and indirect measurements of calcein fluorescence (Fig. 7, BâE). T84-fast cells treated with Best1 siRNA show reduced regulatory volume decrease (Fig. 7B). As both intracellular Ca2+ and cell volume control are essential for the mitotic cell cycle, these results may provide a mechanism for the proliferative role of Eag1 and Best1. Transformation of Colonic Epithelial Cells Increases Proliferation and Ion ConductancesâT84 colonic carcinoma cells are well established (17Dharmsathaphorn K. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 245-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). They grow slowly in patches and form tight and polarized monolayers when cultured on permeable supports. T84 cells were used for numerous electrophysiological studies and resemble a model for electrolyte transport in the colonic epithelium (17Dharmsathaphorn K. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They show many aspects of native epithelial cells such as relatively hyperpolarized membrane voltage and Clâ secretion by cAMP-dependent cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channels. When stimulated by secretagogues such as ATP and carbachol that increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, predominantly K+ channels are activated, hyperpolarizing the membrane voltage. This is comparable with colonic crypt cells, which also activate Ca2+-activated K+ channels upon stimulation of basolateral muscarinic M3 and apical purinergic P2Y2 receptors (18Kunzelmann K. Mall M. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 245-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 19Puntheeranurak S. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Krishnamra N. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 19: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, T84 cells that had undergone spontaneous transformation were remarkably different: they proliferated much faster, were unable to polarize or form tight monolayers when grown on permeable supports, showed typical features of malignancy, and had different membrane conductances. Anderson and Welsh (20Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6003-6007Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) as well as Morris and Frizzell (21Morris A.P. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C968-C976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported earlier that expression of ion channels in epithelial cells is significantly affected by the underlying substrate. Thus Ca2+-activated Clâ channels were prominent in non-differentiated HT29 colonic carcinoma cells but disappeared with polarization (22Fraser G.M. Portnoy M. Bleich M. Ecke D. Niv Y. Greger R. Schwartz B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although T84-fast cells did not polarize when grown on permeable supports, a change in Best1 expression upon differentiation of filter-grown HT29 cells may explain earlier results (22Fraser G.M. Portnoy M. Bleich M. Ecke D. Niv Y. Greger R. Schwartz B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A change in membrane ion conductance has also been reported for spontaneously transformed Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. These fast-growing cells express Ca2+-activated K+ channels that largely enhance cell migration (23Schwab A. Wojnowski L. Gabriel K. Oberleithner H. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fast-growing T84 cells described in the present study showed a strong increase in the expression of the Best1 Clâ channel along with Eag1 potassium channels. Eag1 currents were detected despite a relatively high (100 nm) Ca2+ concentration in resting cells. However, up to 1 Î¼m [Ca2+]i is required for complete inhibition of Eag1, and thus a fraction (â¼40%) of the Eag1 conductance is still detectable in T84-fast cells (24Stansfeld C.E. Roper J. Ludwig J. Weseloh R.M. Marsh S.J. Brown D.A. Pongs O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9910-9914Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Notably, the Clâ channels were already active in non-stimulated cells, i.e. without purinergic stimulation. Additional increase of intracellular Ca2+ by ATP or carbachol did not further increase Clâ conductance. A similar result was obtained when Best1 was overexpressed in T84-slow cells and has also been observed when Best1 was expressed in HEK293 cells (8Kunzelmann K. Milenkovic V.M. Spitzner M. Barro Soria R. Schreiber R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; 454: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This suggests that additional components may be required for Ca2+ regulation of Best1 currents, which may not be present in cancer cells. The presence of these DIDS-sensitive Clâ currents along with astemizole-inhibited Eag1 K+ currents clearly augmented cell proliferation. Ion Channels Induce Malignancy and Metastatic Cell GrowthâClonal selection of fast proliferating T84 cells (T84SF) has been reported previously (25Alessandro R. Flugy A.M. Russo D. Stassi G. De Leo A. Corrado C. Alaimo G. De Leo G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 203: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These cells demonstrate invasive and metastatic cell growth when transferred into nude mice. Basal tyrosine phosphorylation and expression of Src kinase were enhanced in these T84SF cells (25Alessandro R. Flugy A.M. Russo D. Stassi G. De Leo A. Corrado C. Alaimo G. De Leo G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 203: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Along this line, the Src inhibitor PP2 reduced cell growth, invasion, and cell adhesion of T84SF cells (26Boyd D.D. Wang H. Avila H. Parikh N.U. Kessler H. Magdolen V. Gallick G.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 1545-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T lymphocytes, Src kinase controls voltage-dependent Kv1.3 K+ channels, which also affect cell proliferation (27Szabo I. Gulbins E. Apfel H. Zhang X. Barth P. Busch A.E. Schlottmann K. Pongs O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20465-20469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Src kinase may also be up-regulated in fast-growing T84 cells and may be responsible for changes in membrane conductance. It will be interesting to examine in subsequent studies the impact of Eag1 and Best1 on cell migration and tissue invasion since we found previously that genomic amplification of Eag1 in human colorectal carcinoma is an independent marker of adverse prognosis (28Ousingsawat J. Spitzner M. Puntheeranurak S. Terracciano L. Tornillo L. Bubendorf L. Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). How Do Ion Channels Determine Malignancy?âK+ and Clâ channels are essential for cell migration and metastasis of cancer (29Schwab A. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 29-33PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that enhanced intracellular Ca2+ activates Kv channels during intestinal wound healing (30Rao J.N. Platoshyn O. Li L. Guo X. Golovina V.A. Yuan J.X. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C885-C898Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cell migration and formation of tumor metastasis are due to fluctuations in the activity of membrane transporters and ion channels because they cause localized cell swelling and shrinkage (29Schwab A. News Physiol. Sci. 2001; 16: 29-33PubMed Google Scholar). These changes in cell volume appear to be a prerequisite for cell migration and malignant invasion. There are only a few studies that have investigated the role of Clâ channels in cell migration. Clâ channels are probably necessary for cell movement because K+ transport needs to be accompanied by a counterion (23Schwab A. Wojnowski L. Gabriel K. Oberleithner H. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1631-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Notably, bestrophin has been shown to operate as a volume-sensitive Clâ channel (31Fischmeister R. Hartzell H.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 562: 477-491Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A Novel Function of Bestrophin for Cell Proliferation?âClâ currents induced by expression of bestrophins share many of the properties attributed to Ca2+-activated Clâ channels, such as anion selectivity of Iâ > Clâ and inhibition by NFA and DIDS (11Sun H. Tsunenari T. Yau K.W. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 99: 4008-4013Crossref Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 12Qu Z. Fischmeister R. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen.

Chem. 2006; 281: 17460-17467Google Scholar). However, there is an ongoing controversy regarding whether bestrophins are actually channel-forming proteins or, rather, regulators of ion channels. Moreover, other proteins have also been proposed as molecular candidates for the Ca2+-activated Clâ channel (reviewed in Ref. 8Kunzelmann K. Milenkovic V.M. Spitzner M. Barro Soria R. Schreiber R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; 454: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The present results would support the role of Best1 as a Clâ channel. As known from previous studies, Ca2+ and volume-regulated Clâ channels support cell proliferation, and bestrophin is activated by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ as well as cell swelling (7Kunzelmann K. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 205: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 32Chien L.T. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In an ongoing study with M1-collecting duct cells expressing high levels of Best1, we found inhibition of proliferation by the Clâ channel blockers DIDS and NFA. 4M. Spitzner, J. R. Martins, R. Barro Soria, J. Ousingsawat, K. Scheidt, R. Schreiber, and K. Kunzelmann, unpublished results. Thus bestrophins may provide the molecular basis for an understanding of the role of Ca2+ and volume-regulated Clâ channels in cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2157116640,"Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone/cytokine that links nutrition, metabolism, and immune homeostasis and is endowed to modulate several immune responses. We previously demonstrated that both immature and mature human dendritic cells (DCs) express a functional leptin receptor, and we found that leptin activates DCs, licenses them for Th1 priming, and promotes DC survival. Moreover, we found that leptin induces rearrangement of actin microfilaments, leading to uropod and ruffle formation. Here we monitor the effects of leptin on DC migratory capacities, focusing on the intracellular signaling driving cytoskeleton rearrangement. We found that leptin increases immature DC migratory performance both by favoring cytoskeleton dynamics and by up-regulating CCR7 surface expression, thus favoring chemotactic responsiveness. We found that in immature DCs, leptin activates cofilin, favoring the turnover of actin microfilaments, and, by triggering Vav phosphorylation, promotes Rac1 activation. Finally, we found that in immature DCs, leptin up-regulates interleukin-12p70 production on CD40 stimulation and, more importantly, increases their capacity to stimulate activation of autologous CD8(+) T cells. Taken altogether, the findings herein highlight the potential use of leptin as an adjuvant tool in vaccination protocols employing ex vivo-generated autologous DCs."
https://openalex.org/W2053521300,"NEDL1 (NEDD4-like ubiquitin protein ligase-1) is a newly identified HECT-type E3 ubiquitin protein ligase highly expressed in favorable neuroblastomas as compared with unfavorable ones. In this study, we found that NEDL1 cooperates with p53 to induce apoptosis. During cisplatin (CDDP)-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, p53 was induced to accumulate in association with an increase in expression levels of NEDL1. Enforced expression of NEDL1 resulted in a decrease in number of G418-resistant colonies in SH-SY5Y and U2OS cells bearing wild-type p53, whereas NEDL1 had undetectable effect on p53-deficient H1299 and SAOS-2 cells. Similarly, enforced expression of NEDL1 increased number of U2OS cells with sub-G1 DNA content. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays revealed that NEDL1 binds to the COOH-terminal region of p53. Luciferase reporter assay showed that NEDL1 has an ability to enhance the transcriptional activity of p53. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous NEDL1 conferred the resistance of U2OS cells to adriamycin. It is noteworthy that NEDL1 enhanced pro-apoptotic activity of p53 in its catalytic activity-independent manner. Taken together, our present findings suggest that functional interaction of NEDL1 with p53 might contribute to the induction of apoptosis in cancerous cells bearing wild-type p53."
https://openalex.org/W1984871713,"Aldose reductase (AR) catalyzes the reduction of several aldehydes ranging from lipid peroxidation products to glucose. The activity of AR is increased in the ischemic heart due to oxidation of its cysteine residues, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To examine signaling mechanisms regulating AR activation, we studied the role of nitric oxide (NO). Treatment with the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester prevented ischemia-induced AR activation and myocardial sorbitol accumulation in rat hearts subjected to global ischemia ex vivo or coronary ligation in situ, whereas inhibition of inducible NOS and neuronal NOS had no effect. Activation of AR in the ischemic heart was abolished by pretreatment with peroxynitrite scavengers hesperetin or 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis-[4-sulfonatophenyl]-porphyrinato-iron [III]. Site-directed mutagenesis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses showed that Cys-298 of AR was readily oxidized to sulfenic acid by peroxynitrite. Treatment with bradykinin and insulin led to a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of endothelial NOS at Ser-1177 and, even in the absence of ischemia, was sufficient in activating AR. Activation of AR by bradykinin and insulin was reversed upon reduction with dithiothreitol or by inhibiting NOS or PI3K. Treatment with AR inhibitors sorbinil or tolrestat reduced post-ischemic recovery in the rat hearts subjected to global ischemia and increased the infarct size when given before ischemia or upon reperfusion. These results suggest that AR is a cardioprotective protein and that its activation in the ischemic heart is due to peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of Cys-298 to sulfenic acid via the PI3K/Akt/endothelial NOS pathway.

It catalyzes the reduction of a broad spectrum of substrates that range from simple aromatic aldehydes and steroid carbonyls to aldo-keto sugars (1Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. Biochem. Med. Metab.

The wide substrate specificity of AR suggests that the enzyme may be involved in detoxification of endogenous and xenobiotic aldehydes. Our studies show that AR displays highest catalytic efficiency with aldehydes derived from phospholipid oxidation (3Srivastava S. Chandra A. Wang L.F. Seifert Jr., W.E. DaGue B.B. Ansari N.H.

Both free aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal, and phospholipid-bound aldehydes, such as 1-palmitoyl-2-oxo-valeroyl-phosphatidylcholine, are high affinity substrates of the enzyme (4Srivastava S.

Nevertheless, the functional significance of AR up-regulation under conditions of oxidative stress remains unclear. Extant data are contradictory.

Activation of AR in the ischemic heart was found to be due to oxidation of its cysteine residues to sulfenic acids (17Kaiserova K. Srivastava S. Hoetker J.D. Awe S.O. Tang X.L. Cai J. Bhatnagar A. J.

Nonetheless, it remained unclear whether oxidation of AR cysteines to sulfenic acid is a spurious occurrence due to the highly oxidizing conditions prevalent in the ischemic heart or whether it is a controlled event of post-translational modification regulated by intracellular signaling. Accordingly, the present study was undertaken to examine the role of nitric oxide (NO) in this process. Our previous studies show that NO regulates AR activity in vitro (20Chandra A. Srivastava S.

Our primary hypothesis was that NO activates AR in the ischemic hearts and that the activated AR, in turn, protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our findings support this hypothesis and suggest that activation of AR in the ischemic heart is a highly regulated process that could be attributed to peroxynitrite generated in response to stimulation of the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway. Preliminary findings of this study have been reported previously (25Kaiserova K. Awe S.O. Srivastava S. Bhatnagar A. Circulation. 2005; 112: II-283Google Scholar). MaterialsâAmmonium acetate, d,l-glyceraldehyde, dimedone, dithiothreitol (DTT), hesperetin, insulin, heparin, triethanolamine, Me2SO, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002), mammalian protease inhibitor mixture, N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), N-[(4S)-4-amino-5-[(2-aminoethyl)-(aminopentyl)]-Nâ²-nitroguanidine (AAEAPNG), bradykinin, sorbitol, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and peroxynitrite were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The peroxynitrite scavenger, FeTPPS (5,10,15,20-tetrakis-[4-sulfonatophenyl]-porphyrinato iron [III]) was purchased from Calbiochem. Sorbinil (d6-fluoro-spiro-(chroman-4,4â²-(imidazolidine)-2â²,5â²-dione) and the inducible NOS inhibitor BBS-2 (pyrimidine imidazole, or clotrimazole) were the gifts from Pfizer. Tolrestat (N-methyl-N-[(5-trifluoromethyl-6-methoxy-1-napthalenyl)-thiomethyl] glycine was a gift from American Home Products. Primary polyclonal anti-eNOS and phospho-eNOS (Ser(P)-1177)-specific antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Sephadex G-25 columns, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus) reagents, and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harland Teklad. Global Ischemia-Reperfusion ex VivoâA total of 296 rats were used for the entire study. For global ischemia, hearts excised from male rats (300â350 g, 12â16 weeks of age) were cannulated and perfused in the Langendorff retrograde mode, as described (3Srivastava S. Chandra A. Wang L.F. Seifert Jr., W.E. DaGue B.B. Ansari N.H. Srivastava S.K. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10893-10900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 26Bhatnagar A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hearts were perfused at a constant perfusion pressure of 80 mm Hg with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) solution, pH 7.4, containing 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm glucose and equilibrated with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for 10 min. A latex fluid-filled balloon was placed in the left ventricle through an incision in the left atrial appendage and inflated to a pressure of 8â10 mm Hg. The perfusion flow rate was between 8 and 12 ml/min for all heart preparations. The hearts were either perfused for 40 or 70 min with KH solution under aerobic conditions or subjected to indicated durations of ischemia alone or ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Drugs were added to the KH solution 10 min before ischemia. At the end of the protocol, the hearts were freeze-clamped and used for measuring AR and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, sorbitol content, and for Western blot analysis. In Situ Model of Myocardial InfarctionâMale rats (250 to 300 g, 9â12 weeks of age) were subjected either to 20 or 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion or to 15â30 min of occlusion followed by 30 min of reperfusion as described before (17Kaiserova K. Srivastava S. Hoetker J.D. Awe S.O. Tang X.L. Cai J. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15110-15120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Ping P. Zhang J. Huang S.

For studying the effect of AR inhibitors on myocardial ischemic injury, rats were assigned to 6 different groups; in groups 1 and 3, the rats were treated with vehicle (Me2SO, intraperitoneal) alone 30 min before occlusion and subjected to either 20 or 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Groups 2 and 4 rats received sorbinil (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) 30 min before occlusion and underwent either 20 or 30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Group 5 rats were subjected to 30 min of coronary occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion and received intravenous injection of a vehicle (Me2SO) 5 min before reperfusion. Group 6 rats were subjected to 30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 24 h of reperfusion and received intravenous injection of sorbinil (40 mg/kg) 5 min before reperfusion. Rats were given heparin (200 units, intravenously) and then were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intravenous). The hearts were excised and perfused with KH solution through an aortic cannula using the Langendorff apparatus. To delineate the infarcted from the viable myocardium, the hearts were then perfused with a 1% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC staining) in KH solution at a pressure of â¼60 mm Hg (10 ml over 5 min). To demarcate the occluded-reperfused coronary vascular bed, the coronary artery was tied at the site of the previous occlusion, and the aortic root was perfused with a 5% solution of phthalo blue dye (Heucotech, Fairless Hill, PA) in normal saline (3 ml over 3 min). The portion of the left ventricle (LV) supplied by the previously occluded coronary artery (area at risk) was identified by the absence of a blue dye, whereas the rest of the LV was stained dark blue. The heart was then cut into 6â7 transverse slices, and all atrial and right ventricular tissues were excised. The slices were weighed, fixed in a 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde solution, and photographed (Nikon D100 digital camera with a Nikon AF28â105-mm lens plus Promaster Spectrum 7 close-up lenses). Color pictures of heart slices were projected onto a paper screen at 10Ã magnification, and the borders of the infarcted and ischemic-reperfused and non-ischemic regions were traced. The traced papers were then scanned into the computer, and corresponding areas were measured by computerized planimetry (Adobe Photoshop, Version 7.0). The infarct size was calculated as a percentage of the area at risk. Measurement of AR Activity and Sorbitol ContentâThe catalytic activity of AR and tissue sorbitol content were measured as described previously (17Kaiserova K. Srivastava S. Hoetker J.D. Awe S.O. Tang X.L. Cai J. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15110-15120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, left ventricular tissue was homogenized in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT and protease inhibitor mixture (1:100, v/v). Where indicated, the enzyme was reduced with 100 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 Â°C in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. AR activity was measured in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing 0.15 mm NADPH and 10 mm glyceraldehyde. Modification of Recombinant ARâHuman recombinant AR:WT, AR:C298S, and AR:C303S mutants were purified from Escherichia coli as described earlier (28Petrash J.M. Harter T.M. Devine C.S. Olins P.O. Bhatnagar A. Liu S. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24833-24840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that a His-tag leader sequence was inserted into cDNA. The proteins were purified on a Ni2+ affinity column as described before (17Kaiserova K. Srivastava S. Hoetker J.D. Awe S.O. Tang X.L. Cai J. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15110-15120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To examine the molecular mechanism of peroxynitrite-mediated AR activation, reduced DTT-free enzyme (0.3 mg) was incubated with 0.01â1 mm peroxynitrite for 1 h in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, in the dark. The reaction was stopped by desalting the enzyme on Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, or 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0. To document sulfenic acid formation, the modified protein was incubated for 30 min with 0.5 mm dimedone, a sulfenic-acid specific reagent. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI/MS)âFor ESI/MS analysis the protein was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with N2-saturated ammonium acetate (10 mm, pH 7.0). The desalted protein was diluted with the flow injection solvent (acetonitrile:H2O:formic acid; 50:50:1, v/v/v). The mixture was injected into a MicroMass ZMD spectrometer at a rate of 10 Î¼l/min. The operating parameters were as follows: capillary voltage 3.1 kV; cone voltage 27 V; extractor voltage 4 V; source block temperature 100 Â°C and desolvation temperature 200 Â°C. Spectra were acquired at the rate of 200 atomic mass units over the range of 20â2000 atomic mass units. The instrument was calibrated with myoglobin (0.15 mg/ml) dissolved in the mixture of acetonitrile and H2O 50:50 (v/v) containing 0.2% (v/v) formic acid. Western Blot AnalysisâHeart tissue was homogenized in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (1:100). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a polyvinyl difluoride membrane. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL Plus Western blot detection kit. Measurement of SDH ActivityâThe activity of SDH was determined by spectrophotometric monitoring of NADH oxidation, when fructose was reduced to sorbitol, as described previously (29Ng T.F. Lee F.K. Song Z.T. Calcutt N.A. Lee L.W. Chung S.S.M. Chung S.K. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat hearts and liver tissues were homogenized in 100 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was used for enzymatic assay under 100 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 0.4 m fructose, and 0.4 mm NADH. The decrease in A340 was monitored for 3 min at room temperature. Statistical AnalysisâIndividual saturation curves used to obtain steady-state kinetic parameters were analyzed using a general Michaelis-Menten equation in EnzFitter (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). In all cases best fits to the data were chosen on the basis of the standard error of the fitted parameters. All data are expressed as the mean Â± S.D. and were analyzed by one way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons or by Student's t test for unpaired data. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. AR Activation Is Mediated by NOâOur previous study shows that the activity of AR is increased in rat hearts subjected to ischemia (17Kaiserova K. Srivastava S. Hoetker J.D. Awe S.O. Tang X.L. Cai J. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15110-15120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because NO production is increased in the ischemic heart (30Berges A. Van Nassauw L. Timmermans J.P. Vrints C. Pharmacol. Res. 2007; 55: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and AR is activated by NO (13Hwang Y.C. Sato S. Tsai J.Y. Yan S. Bakr S. Zhang H. Oates P.J. Ramasamy R. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we examined the role of NO using NOS inhibitors. As reported before (17Kaiserova K. Srivastava S. Hoetker J.D. Awe S.O. Tang X.L. Cai J. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15110-15120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), measurements of AR activity and sorbitol levels in the heart tissue after different durations of ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion showed a time-dependent increase that reached a maxima after 30 min of ischemia in both ex vivo (Fig. 1A) and in situ (Fig. 1B) models. To examine whether NO generation in the ischemic myocardium affects AR activation, hearts were treated with NOS inhibitor l-NAME before initiating ischemia. As shown in Fig. 1C, treatment with l-NAME (0.1 mm) led to a slight but statistically significant decrease in AR activity and sorbitol content in the perfused hearts and completely prevented AR activation in both ex vivo (Fig. 1C) and in situ (Fig. 1D) models of ischemia-reperfusion. To examine the role of specific NOS isoforms, hearts were treated with the neuronal NOS inhibitor AAEAPNG or the inducible NOS inhibitor BBS-2. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, neither of these inhibitors prevented AR activation in either of the two models. From these results we conclude that eNOS is the most likely source of AR activation in the ischemic heart and that neuronal NOS and inducible NOS do not play a significant role in this process. AR Is Activated by PeroxynitriteâWe had previously reported that activation of AR in the ischemic heart could be prevented by superoxide scavengers (17Kaiserova K. Srivastava S. Hoetker J.D. Awe S.O. Tang X.L. Cai J. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15110-15120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because generation of both superoxide (31Becker B.L. van den Hoek T.L. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: 2240-2246PubMed Google Scholar) and NO (32Node K. Kitakaze M. Kosaka H. Komamura K. Minamino T. Inoue M. Tada M. Hori M. Kamada T. Circulation. 1996; 93: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) is increased during ischemia, we reasoned that AR activation may be dependent upon formation of their product, peroxynitrite. To examine the role of peroxynitrite, isolated hearts were perfused with a peroxynitrite scavenger, hesperetin, or a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, FeTPPS. Both hesperetin and FeTPPS have previously been shown to be potent scavengers of peroxynitrite (33Lancel S. Tissier S. Mordon S. Marechal X. Depontieu F. Scherpereel A. Chopin C. Neviere R. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 43: 2348-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our results show that treatment with 10â100 Î¼m hesperetin or FeTPPS led to a significant dose-dependent reduction of AR activation and sorbitol content in both perfused and ischemic hearts (Fig. 2, AâD). These results suggest that activation of AR in the ischemic heart may be due to peroxynitrite. Because small quantities of peroxynitrite could be formed also in the perfused heart (34Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hwang Y.C. Bakr S. Ellery C.A. Oates P.J. Ramasamy R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2331-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), peroxynitrite could also account for AR activation under non-ischemic conditions. To determine whether peroxynitrite activates AR directly, we examined the effects of peroxynitrite on the kinetic properties of pure AR protein. As shown in the Fig. 3A (inset), incubation of recombinant AR protein with 0.1â1 mm peroxynitrite for 1 h caused a dose-dependent increase in AR activity. At 1 mm peroxynitrite, a 4-fold increase in AR activity was observed. Treatment with peroxynitrite also diminished the inhibitor sensitivity of the enzyme. Although 80% of the activity of the fully reduced non-treated enzyme was inhibited by 1 Î¼m sorbinil, only 20% of the peroxynitrite-modified enzyme was inhibited by the same concentration of sorbinil. Because a decrease in sorbinil sensitivity indicates cysteine oxidation of AR (17Kaiserova K. Srivastava S. Hoetker J.D. Awe S.O. Tang X.L. Cai J. Bhatnagar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15110-15120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), these data suggest that treatment with peroxynitrite causes oxidative modification of AR cysteines. To examine whether this modification is due to oxidation of the cysteines to sulfenic acid, the peroxynitrite-modified enzyme was treated with dimedone, which binds selectively to protein sulfenic acids (36Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Claiborne A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 325-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and abolishes ischemic activation of AR (17Kaiserova K. Srivastava S.

As shown in the Fig. 3A, incubation of un-modified AR with dimedone led to a slight decrease in AR activity (presumably due to the presence of sulfenic acids in the non-treated protein). Treatment with dimedone caused a marked decrease in the activity of the peroxynitrite-treated enzyme. The residual activity of the peroxynitrite and dimedone-treated enzyme was sensitive to sorbinil, indicating that this is due to the unmodified form of the enzyme in which the cysteine residues are in the reduced state. Measurements of steady-state kinetic parameters revealed that treatment of AR with peroxynitrite did not affect the Km (glyceraldehyde) of the enzyme, although Vmax was increased 2.5-fold (Table 1). Dimedone by itself did not affect either the Km or the Vmax of the enzyme; however, it prevented peroxynitrite-mediated change in the Vmax (Table 1). When AR was modified with peroxynitrite, dimedone treatment caused a 3-fold increase in Km of the enzyme, suggesting that binding of dimedone inhibits AR by decreasing the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that peroxynitrite could directly activate AR by oxidizing its"

To this end, we have inhibited the expression of MBD proteins in HeLa cells by short hairpin RNAs; and studied the functional consequences of MBD depletion using microarray-based expression analysis in conjunction with extensive bisulfite genomic sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The removal of MBDs results in a release of gene silencing associated with a loss of MBD occupancy in 5'-CpG islands without any change in the DNA methylation pattern. Our results unveil new targets for epigenetic inactivation mediated by MBDs in transformed cells, such as the cell adhesion protein gamma-parvin and the fibroblast growth factor 19, where we also demonstrate their bona fide tumor suppressor features. Our data support a fundamental role for MBD proteins in the direct maintenance of transcriptional repression of tumor suppressors and identify new candidate genes for epigenetic disruption in cancer cells."

To elucidate the role of SSB in TLS we used an in vitro exonuclease protection assay and found that SSB increases the accessibility of 3â² primer termini located at abasic sites in RecA-coated gapped DNA. The mutant SSB-113 protein, which is defective in protein-protein interactions, but not in DNA binding, was as effective as wild-type SSB in increasing primer termini accessibility, but deficient in supporting polV-catalyzed TLS. Consistently, the heterologous SSB proteins gp32, encoded by phage T4, and ICP8, encoded by herpes simplex virus 1, could replace E. coli SSB in the TLS reaction, albeit with lower efficiency. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that polV directly interacts with SSB and that this interaction is disrupted by the SSB-113 mutation.

RecA has two additional roles in TLS: (a) It activates UmuD by promoting its autocleavage to UmuDâ², which then binds to UmuC to form the UmuDâ²2C complex polV (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. 2nd Ed. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington DC2006: 463-661Google Scholar). (b) A direct role in TLS which involves the recruitment of UmuDâ² to DNA (10Frank E.G. Hauser J. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RecA promotes these activities in its DNA-bound form, which consists of a nucleoprotein filament formed by its cooperative binding to ssDNA (11Roca A.I. Cox M.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

SSB is an essential protein in E. coli, involved in replication, recombination and repair. Functional homologs of SSB are present in all organisms, and their importance is well illustrated by the occurrence of viral SSBs (12Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Overman L.B. Trends Biochem.

E. coli SSB is a 75kDa tetramer composed of four identical subunits. It binds ssDNA strongly via a ssDNA-binding domain located at its N terminus, and interacts with a variety of proteins via its C terminus (15Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 16Genschel J. Curth U. Urbanke C. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Sandigursky M.

A detailed kinetic analysis showed that SSB had a dramatic effect on TLS by polV across an abasic site (21Pham P. Bertram J.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2001; 409: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), however, under some conditions SSB was found to be stimulatory rather than essential for in vitro TLS (22Fujii S. Gasser V. Fuchs R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We used an in vitro reconstituted TLS assay system to study the mechanism by which SSB exerts its effect on TLS. We report here that SSB has a dual role in polV-catalyzed TLS: 1) it increases the accessibility of the primer-template near a template lesion on RecA-coated DNA, and 2) it directly interacts with UmuC. This suggests that SSB functions in the recruitment of polV to the primer-template-lesion site on RecA-coated DNA, an early stage in the initiation of TLS. ProteinsâProteins used in this study were purified as described in the respective references: RecA (23Cox M.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol.

Robert Lehman (Stanford University School of Medicine), and the Î³ complex and human RPA were gifts from Michael O'Donnell (The Rockefeller University, New York). T4 gene 32 protein, E. coli DNA pol I Klenow fragment, and E. coli exonuclease III were from Amersham Biosciences. Bovine serum albumin, proteinase K, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, and Asp700 were from Roche Applied Science; Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, were from New England Biolabs, T7 gp6 exonuclease was from Amersham Biosciences, and S1 nuclease was from Promega. T4 gp32 and ICP8 were free of contaminating E. coli SSB, as determined by Western blot analysis. Construction of Gapped PlasmidsâThe gapped plasmids were constructed as previously described (28Tomer G. Reuven N.B. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14106-14111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Tomer G. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5948-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, a phosphorylated primer was annealed together with phosphorylated downstream oligonucleotide to the template, and following ligation of this gapped duplex to the recipient vector, the reaction products were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gapped circular plasmid was extracted from the gel using an electroelutor (Elutrap, Schleicher and Schuell). The gap was extended to a size of â¼350 nucleotides using phage T7 gp6 5â²â3â² exonuclease as described previously (28Tomer G. Reuven N.B. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14106-14111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). TLS AssayâThe TLS reaction was performed as previously described (7Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 28Tomer G. Reuven N.B. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14106-14111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with minor changes. The standard reaction mixture (12.5 Î¼l) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 Î¼g/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm of each dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP, 2 nm radiolabeled gapped plasmid (GP21E), 25â1000 nm SSB tetramers, 2 Î¼m RecA, 200 nm polV (as 200 nm MBP-UmuC and 400 nm UmuDâ²). When present, the Î² subunit was at 40 nm (as dimers), and the Î³ complex was at 20 nm. SSB H55K, SSB-1, or SSB-113 were each at 25â400 nm tetramers. T4 gp32 was at 1 Î¼m, and HSV ICP8 at 180 nm. Reactions were carried out at 37 Â°C as follows: RecA, and the Î³ complex and Î² clamp when present, were preincubated with the DNA substrate in the assay buffer for 2 min. Next the desired SSB was added, and reactions were incubated for 4 additional min. Then polV was added, and the reaction was further incubated for 4â20 min. Reactions were terminated, and the DNA products were obtained, as described before (30Reuven N.B. Arad G. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5511-5517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The extent of bypass was calculated by dividing the amount of bypass products by the amount of the extended primers (âlesion bypassâ). TLS was also calculated, by dividing the amount of bypass products by the total amount of DNA. Initiation of synthesis was calculated by dividing the amount of extended primers by the total amount of DNA. Primer Accessibility AssayâThe primer accessibility assay consisted of monitoring the excision of the 3â² terminal nucleotides by E. coli exonuclease III using as a substrate RecA-coated gap-lesion plasmid. Reactions were carried out under conditions similar to the TLS assay, but without dNTPs and polV, and in the presence of E. coli exonuclease III at 0.01â0.025 unit/Î¼l. Other proteins, when present, were at the following concentrations: RecA, 2â30 Î¼m; E. coli wild-type SSB and SSB-113, 100 nm (tetramers); T4 gp32, 1 Î¼m. When the RecA protein was present at a concentration >2 Î¼m, the assay was conducted in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, consisting of 0.2 mg/ml creatine kinase and 10 mm creatine phosphate. Reactions were carried out at 37 Â°C as follows: RecA and the DNA substrate were preincubated in the assay buffer for 2 min. Next SSB, SSB-113, or T4 gp32 were added, and the reactions were further incubated for 4 min. Then exonuclease III was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 Â°C for 6â8 min. Reaction products were treated with proteinase K, restricted, and fractionated by urea-PAGE as described for the TLS assay. Restriction Nuclease Protection AssayâThe restriction nuclease protection assay measured the modulation of the restriction of the gap-lesion plasmid by RecA and SSB. The relevant restriction sites are shown in Fig. 3A. The reactions were performed as described for the TLS assay with the following changes. The DNA substrates used were not radiolabeled, and reactions were carried out with neither dNTPs nor polV, and with either RsaI (0.04â0.06 unit/Î¼l) or MspA 1I (1.6 units/Î¼l), RecA (2â25 Î¼m), E. coli SSB (0.2â1 Î¼m as tetramers), and an ATP-regenerating system, as described above. As a control, in addition to the gap-lesion substrate, plasmid pFGP21 was used. This is a control covalently closed plasmid, which is similar to GP21E, except that it is fully double-stranded and contains no lesion (31Avkin S. Adar S. Blander G. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3764-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 37 Â°C as following: RecA and the DNA substrate (GP21E or pFGP21, each at 4 nm) were preincubated in the assay buffer for 2 min. When present, SSB was added at this stage. The reactions were further incubated for 4 min, after which the restriction nuclease was added, and the reaction was incubated at for up to 6 min 37 Â°C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1% SDS loading buffer, heat-inactivated for 5 min at 70 Â°C, and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide. Reaction products were visualized under UV light. Immunoprecipitation AssayâImmunoprecipitation reactions were performed by incubating the indicated proteins (UmuC-MBP, 9.5 Î¼g; MBP, 9.5 Î¼g; SSB, 13 Î¼g; and SSB-113, 13 Î¼g) at 4 Â°C for 30 min, in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, in a final volume of 100 Î¼l. A monoclonal antibody against MBP (1 Î¼g, New England Biolabs) diluted in 200 Î¼l of binding buffer was then added to each reaction mixture, for an additional incubation of 1 h at 4 Â°C. Finally, 50 Î¼l (50% v/v) protein A resin (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the reaction mixtures, for an additional incubation of 1 h. The protein A resins were subsequently washed 6 times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Resin-bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 25 Î¼l of a solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue and fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The presence of SSB in the gel was assayed by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-SSB antibodies (32Witte G. Urbanke C. Curth U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), followed by goat-anti-rabbit antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase (1:20,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc). SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) was used for detecting horseradish peroxidase on immunoblots. The SSB-1 and SSB H55K Mutants Are Defective in polV-catalyzed TLSâThe in vitro TLS assay used in this study, which was previously developed in our laboratory (7Reuven N.B. Tomer G. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Reuven N.B. Arad G. Maor-Shoshani A. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 29Tomer G. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5948-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), is based on a gapped plasmid carrying a site-specific synthetic abasic site in the ssDNA region, and an internal 32P label near the primer terminus. Upon addition of polV, RecA, and SSB, DNA synthesis initiates from the 3â² primer terminus, and continues up to and across the abasic site. To facilitate the analysis of TLS products, the DNA is extracted from the reaction mixture and restricted to produce a set of short radiolabeled oligonucleotides, representing uninitiated primers, replication arrest at the lesion, and TLS products. Analysis of the products obtained in this manner allows the quantification of three variables as follows: (a) synthesis, defined as all extended products out of all available primers; (b) bypass, defined as all synthesis products longer than 30 nucleotides, out of all primers that were extended (the lesion is at position 30 with respect to the MspA1I cleavage site; Fig. 1A); and (c) TLS, defined as all products longer than 30 nucleotides, out of all available primers. First we examined whether the SSB-1 mutant can support in vitro polV-catalyzed TLS. The SSB-1 mutant causes a temperature-sensitive phenotype in vivo, as well as UV sensitivity (33Glassberg J. Meyer R.R. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 14-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lieberman H.B. Witkin E.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 183: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vitro analysis revealed that the SSB-1 mutation causes a defect in tetramerization of the protein, which is likely to be responsible for its phenotype (35Williams K.R. Murphy J.B. Chase J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11804-11811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of TLS with polV, RecA, and the SSB-1 protein revealed strong reductions in both synthesis and bypass by polV (Fig. 1B). Consistently, analysis of the SSB H55K mutant protein, known to be more defective than SSB-1 in tetramerization in vitro (24Curth U. Bayer I. Greipel J. Mayer F. Urbanke C. Maass G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), showed even lower extents of initiation and bypass by polV (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that SSB is required in its tetrameric form during polV-catalyzed TLS. SSB Increases the Accessibility of the 3â² Primer Terminus in RecA-coated Gap-lesion PlasmidsâThe RecA nucleoprotein filament was proposed to target polV to the damaged DNA, most likely through its interaction with UmuDâ². However, as the RecA filament extends to the double-stranded DNA region at the 3â² primer terminus, it might interfere with the binding of polV to the primer terminus. Indeed, high concentrations of RecA were found to inhibit TLS in our system (36Berdichevsky A. Izhar L. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 917-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To directly examine the effects of RecA and SSB on primer accessibility, we utilized an exonuclease protection assay, based on the ability of the E. coli exonuclease III to excise the primer terminus in the 3â²â5â² direction. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, exonuclease III excised the primer strand, as indicated by the appearance of radiolabeled oligonucleotides shorter than 19 nucleotides (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Pre-formation of a RecA nucleoprotein filament with increasing concentrations of RecA caused increasingly stronger inhibition of the 3â²â5â² excision of the primer terminus by exonuclease III (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). Taking the fraction of the degraded primers as a measure of exonuclease activity, excision decreased from 88% in the absence of RecA down to 10â14% in its presence (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). The addition of SSB partially relieved this inhibition, causing up to a 3- to 4-fold increase in primer excision at 15â30 Î¼m RecA (Fig. 2A). SSB alone had a minor effect on the excision by exonuclease III (Fig. 2A, lane 12). A Heterologous SSB Also Increases the Accessibility of the Primer Terminus in RecA-coated DNAâTo examine whether SSB exerts its effect via its ability to bind ssDNA, we examined the ability of a heterologous SSB, the phage T4 gp32, to increase the accessibility of the primer terminus in RecA-coated DNA. To that end we performed the exonuclease protection assay with RecA-coated gapped plasmid as before, but with T4 gp32 instead of SSB. As can be seen in Fig. 2B the addition of RecA to GP21E caused a decrease in primer excision by exonuclease III, as shown above, from 94% to 27% (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7, respectively). Addition of T4 gp32 partially relieved this inhibition, leading to 58% primer degradation (Fig. 2B, lane 8). T4 gp32 itself had a marginal effect on the activity of exonuclease III and did not contain contaminating exonuclease activity (lanes 9 and 10, respectively). The ability of T4 gp32 to relieve the RecA inhibition of exonuclease III activity is generally similar to that of E. coli SSB (Fig. 2, A and B (lanes 1â5)), suggesting that their effect is at the DNA level, mediated primarily by their ssDNA binding activity. The observed mild activity difference between the two SSBs may stem from their different ssDNA binding modes. We also examined the effect of RPA, the human SSB, on primer accessibility in the presence of RecA, using the same assay. In contrast to the E. coli SSB and phage T4 gp32, human RPA was essentially unable to relieve the RecA inhibition of exonuclease activity (supplemental Table S1). Thus not every SSB can relief RecA inhibition of 3â² primer accessibility. SSB Does Not Cause Total Disassembly of the RecA Nucleoprotein FilamentâTo examine whether SSB causes a major disassembly of the RecA nucleofilament, or rather a more local change at the primer-template-lesion region, we used a restriction nuclease-protection assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, the restriction nuclease RsaI has two cleavage sites, located 78 and 1141 bp upstream to the primer terminus. Incubation of RsaI with pFGP21, an intact control plasmid, which mimics filled and ligated GP21E, yielded the two predicted DNA fragments of 1929 and 1063 bp (Fig. 3B, lane 6). Addition of RecA at concentrations of 2â10 Î¼m had no effect on RsaI cleavage (Fig. 3B, lanes 7â9), as expected. This demonstrates that RecA, when not bound to DNA, did not inhibit RsaI. When the assay was conducted with the gap-lesion plasmid GP21E, the digestion pattern changed. In the absence of RecA, the gapped plasmid was fully cleaved by RsaI, yielding two DNA fragments (Fig. 3B, lane 1; the migration of the larger fragment is slightly faster than the control, because it is partially single-stranded). However, upon the addition of RecA, cleavage of GP21E by RsaI was inhibited, such that at 5 and 10 Î¼m RecA the large majority of cleavage products consisted of singly cut GP21E (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Additionally, uncleaved GP21E was also observed (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that both restriction sites were blocked for RsaI digestion. As the only difference between GP21E and pFGP21 is the single-stranded DNA region, these results indicate that a nucleoprotein RecA-ssDNA filament formed at the gapped region enabled RecA to continuously cover the double-stranded DNA region adjacent to the gap in the 5â²â3â² direction, covering both RsaI sites. Addition of increasing amounts of SSB had essentially no effect on the digestion of GP21E by RsaI, as demonstrated in Fig. 3C (lanes 2â5). These results suggest that SSB did not cause an overall disassembly of the RecA nucleoprotein filament. It is noteworthy that SSB itself did not affect the activity of RsaI (Fig. 3C, lanes 6â8). The RsaI site closest to the 3â² primer terminus is located 78 bases upstream from it. To study the effect of SSB on the RecA filament closer to the 3â² primer terminus, another restriction endonuclease, MspA1I, was employed. As schematically shown in Fig. 3A, MspA1I has three restriction sites on GP21E, located 19, 2341 and 2586 bp upstream to the primer terminus (Fig. 3A, right scheme, 1â3, respectively). The predicted products of MspA1I digestion are shown in Fig. 3A, as well. Full digestion of GP21E in the presence of MspA1I is demonstrated in Fig. 3D, lane 2, where only the largest fragment obtained is shown. In the presence of RecA, in addition to the fully digested DNA product, which was 2322 bp long, several longer products were obtained, including the closed circular plasmid (Fig. 3D, lane 3). These fragments resulted from inhibition of MspA1I cleavage, leading to partial digestion. A similar digestion pattern was obtained upon the addition of SSB to RecA-containing reactions (Fig. 3D, lanes 4 and 5). SSB itself did not affect digestion by MspA1I (Fig. 3D, lane 6). Digestion of the control fully double-stranded pFGP21 by MspA1I was unaffected by the presence of RecA (Fig. 3D, lanes 8 and 9), or RecA and SSB (Fig. 3D, lanes 10 and 11). However, SSB itself caused an electrophoretic shift (Fig. 3D, lane 12), consistent with the previously reported binding of SSB to supercoiled DNA (37Clendenning J.B. Schurr J.M. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 52: 227-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The finding that SSB is unable to relieve the RecA inhibition at sites flanking the primer terminus and beyond indicate that SSB acts in a significantly local manner, presumably by exposing the primer terminus to enzymatic activity. Heterologous SSBs Support TLS by polVâIf the function of SSB in TLS involves increasing the accessibility of the 3â² primer terminus, heterologous SSBs, which exhibit a similar property, might be able to substitute for E. coli SSB in the in vitro TLS reaction. Fig. 4A shows the results of a TLS experiment performed with polV, RecA, and T4 gp32. As expected, in the absence of any SSB, polV and RecA did not show any DNA synthesis activity (Fig. 4A, lane 6). Upon addition of T4 gp32, primer extension by polV was observed up to the abasic site, but not beyond it (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 9). T4 gp32 alone did not show any significant primer extension activity (Fig. 4A, lane 12). Because the Î² subunit sliding clamp and the Î³ complex clamp loader were previously shown to stimulate the TLS activity of polV (22Fujii S. Gasser V. Fuchs R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 39Maor-Shoshani A. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14438-14446Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we examined their effect on TLS in the presence of T4 gp32. Remarkably, upon the addition of these processivity proteins polV, in the presence of T4 gp32, was able to significantly bypass the abasic site, as evident from the extension of the primer to a length of 47 nucleotides (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 10). Thus, T4 gp32 can support polV-catalyzed TLS in the absence of SSB, although it is less effective than E. coli SSB (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 5 to 3, and lanes 10 to 8). A similar experiment was performed with ICP8, the HSV single-stranded DNA-binding protein, yielding remarkably similar results (Fig. 4B). DNA synthesis up to the abasic site, but not beyond it, was observed when ICP8 was present in the reaction mixture instead of SSB (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 11). When the Î² subunit sliding clamp and the Î³ complex clamp loader were added, significant bypass across the abasic site by polV was observed in the presence of ICP8 (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 12). Similar to the reaction in the presence of T4 gp32 protein, TLS was less effective when E. coli SSB was replaced by ICP8. We also examined the effect of human RPA on polV-catalyzed TLS. In contrast to the experiments with T4 gp32 and HSV ICP8, only marginal TLS was observed by polV in the presence of RPA (supplemental Table S2), consistent with its inability to increase accessibility of the 3â² primer terminus (supplemental Table S1). SSB Acts in TLS via a Second Mechanism, Additional to ssDNA BindingâThe findings that heterologous SSBs stimulated bypass to a lesser extent than E. coli SSB raised the possibility tha"

https://openalex.org/W2137959498,"Tastin was previously characterized as an accessory protein for cell adhesion that participates in early embryo implantation. Here, we report that tastin is also required for spindle assembly during mitosis. Tastin protein levels peaked in the G(2)/M phase and abruptly declined after cell division. Microscopy showed that tastin is primarily localized on the microtubules, centrosomes, and the mitotic spindle during the cell cycle. Tastin interacted with the dynein intermediate chain, p150(Glued), and gamma-tubulin in addition to Tctex-1 (the light chain of dynein). Overexpression of tastin led to monopolar spindle formation, whereas loss of tastin expression caused profound mitotic block and preferentially induced multipolar spindles. These multipolar spindles were generated through a loss of cohesion in mitotic centrosomes; specifically, tastin depletion caused the fragmentation of pericentrosomal material and the splitting of the centrioles at the spindle poles. Tastin depletion induced centrosome abnormalities exclusively during mitosis and required both microtubule integrity and Eg5 activity. However, tastin depletion did not disrupt the organization of spindle poles, as revealed by localization of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) and the p150(Glued) component of dynactin. These data indicate that the major function of tastin during mitosis is to maintain the structural and dynamic features of centrosomes, thereby contributing to spindle bipolarity."
https://openalex.org/W2005473412,"A major factor in profilin regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics is its facilitation of G-actin nucleotide exchange. However, the mechanism of this facilitation is unknown. We studied the interaction of yeast (YPF) and human profilin 1 (HPF1) with yeast and mammalian skeletal muscle actins. Homologous pairs (YPF and yeast actin, HPF1 and muscle actin) bound more tightly to one another than heterologous pairs. However, with saturating profilin, HPF1 caused a faster etheno-ATP exchange with both yeast and muscle actins than did YPF. Based on the -fold change in ATP exchange rate/Kd, however, the homologous pairs are more efficient than the heterologous pairs. Thus, strength of binding of profilin to actin and nucleotide exchange rate are not tightly coupled. Actin/HPF interactions were entropically driven, whereas YPF interactions were enthalpically driven. Hybrid yeast actins containing subdomain 1 (sub1) or subdomain 1 and 2 (sub12) muscle actin residues bound more weakly to YPF than did yeast actin (Kd = 2 Î¼m versus 0.6 Î¼m). These hybrids bound even more weakly to HPF than did yeast actin (Kd = 5 Î¼m versus 3.2 Î¼m). sub1/YPF interactions were entropically driven, whereas the sub12/YPF binding was enthalpically driven. Compared with WT yeast actin, YPF binding to sub1 occurred with a 5 times faster koff and a 2 times faster kon. sub12 bound with a 3 times faster koff and a 1.5 times slower kon. Profilin controls the energetics of its interaction with nonhybrid actin, but interactions between actin subdomains 1 and 2 affect the topography of the profilin binding site.

Profilin controls the energetics of its interaction with nonhybrid actin, but interactions between actin subdomains 1 and 2 affect the topography of the profilin binding site. The interaction of actin with the small protein profilin is central to the regulation of actin filament dynamics within the cell. Profilin was first identified as a protein that bound to G-actin and, through sequestration of actin monomers, inhibited filament formation (1Southwick F.S. Young C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1965-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Babcock G. Rubenstein P.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The majority of subsequent work demonstrated that profilin exhibited a preference for ATP versus ADP actin and catalyzed the exchange of actin-bound adenine nucleotide (3Romero S. Didry D. Larquet E.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, a few studies have disputed this nucleotide preference (6Kinosian H.J. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Estes J.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6734-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Later work showed that profilin could also work with the actin filament nucleator, formin, to promote filament elongation by delivering actin monomers to the growing end of the formin-capped filament (8Vavylonis D. Kovar D.R. O'Shaughnessy B. Pollard T.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 455-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D.

Cell. 2004; 119: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar).The ability of profilin to preferentially sequester ATP G-actin and to facilitate adenine nucleotide exchange from the actin is important, considering the role that an actin-dependent ATP hydrolysis cycle plays in actin dynamics. G-actin is a poor ATPase whose activity is stimulated by polymerization. Subsequent discharge of the Pi from ADP-Pi F-actin occurs at different rates, depending on the particular actin isoform involved, and results in the generation of ADP-F-actin (11Yao X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25598-25604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Carlier M.F. Adv. Biophys. 1990; 26: 51-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In terms of filament stability, ATP and ADP-Pi actin are more stable than ADP-F-actin (13Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After release of ADP-monomers from the end of the actin filament, the ADP exchanges for ATP, and the polymerization cycle starts again. Profilin may have a role in facilitating this exchange and thereby help to regulate the dynamics of actin filament formation (13Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the necessity for this rate enhancement may not be universally applicable. For example, plant profilin does not catalyze nucleotide exchange from actin (14Perelroizen I. Didry D. Christensen H. Chua N.H. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, it can complement a profilin-deficient strain of Dictyostelium discoideum with little if any loss of normal cell behavior (15Arasada R. Gloss A. Tunggal B. Joseph J.M. Rieger D. Mondal S. Faix J. Schleicher M. Noegel A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Although profilin generally is not thought of as an enzyme, it actually acts as one in its facilitation of the actin nucleotide exchange reaction. It must first reversibly bind to the actin and then cause a conformational change that results in enhanced rates of release of the bound adenine nucleotide. Initial studies revealed that the extent of the enhancement is highly dependent on the type of profilin used. For example, under saturating conditions, with muscle actin, mammalian profilin enhances the rate of exchange 30-1000-fold (16Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), yeast profilin enhances it 3-fold (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and profilin from the plant Arabidopsis shows no enhancement of exchange rate (14Perelroizen I. Didry D. Christensen H. Chua N.H. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Initial studies also suggest that the nature of the binding of profilin to actin seems to depend on both the profilin and the actin involved. For example, human platelet profilin binds muscle actin about 50-fold more tightly than it binds yeast actin (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The energetics that defines the actin-profilin interaction can be very different depending on the particular actin-profilin pair involved. Based on incomplete data obtained so far, change in enthalpy seems to control the interaction of yeast profilin with muscle actin, whereas change in entropy seems to drive the interaction of human profilin with muscle actin (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whether this difference applies only to these two actin-profilin pairs or is more general is not known. Insight into the molecular basis of the profilin-actin interaction came from the crystallographic studies of the profilin-actin complex carried out by Schutt and co-workers (18Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 19Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Profilin binds to actin across actin subdomains 1 and 3 at the barbed end of the actin monomer, and this interaction seems to result in an opening of the cleft separating the two domains of the actin molecule in which the ATP resides. This opening occurs by a pivoting motion of the two domains around a hinge region involving a helix containing residues 137-144 in the bridge between subdomains 1 and 3 (20Page R. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the manner in which this movement is brought about is not understood.To gain more insight into the mechanism governing the profilin-dependent acceleration of the release of actin-bound nucleotide, we have carried out a detailed study of both the binding and exchange reactions involving the interaction of both yeast and human profilins with both muscle and yeast actins. We were especially interested in the yeast/muscle actin comparison, because yeast actin inherently exchanges its nucleotide 30 times faster than does muscle actin despite the 87% homology between the two proteins (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Rubenstein P.A. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We also present work with a hybrid actin we have constructed in which subdomains 1 and 2 are from muscle actin and subdomains 3 and 4 are from yeast actin to better understand the relative importance of subdomains 1 and 3 in its interaction with profilin.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein PreparationsâYeast hybrid and H372R mutant actins were generated as described previously (22McKane M.

Yeast wild type (WT) 2The abbreviations used are: WTwild typeITCisothermal titration calorimetryÏµATPetheno-ATP. and mutant actins were purified by a combination of DNase I affinity chromatography and DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described by Cook et al. (24Cook R.K. Sheff D.R. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Globular actins (G-actins) were stored in G buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 Â°C and used within 5 days. The yeast profilin and human profilin I Escherichia coli expression plasmids were kindly provided by S. Almo (Albert Einstein College of Medicine) and D. Schafer (University of Virginia), respectively. The mutant human profilin I molecules were engineered using the QuikChangeÂ® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All profilins were expressed by E. coli BL21 and purified with a procedure similar to that described by Eads et al. (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the cells expressing the profilin were lysed by sonication in the presence of 1 unit/Î¼l rLysozymeâ¢ (Novagen, San Diego, CA) and 50 Î¼g/ml DNase I (Worthington). The profilin in the cell supernatant obtained by centrifugation of the cell lysate was further purified by polyproline affinity chromatography and Q Sepharose fast flow chromatography. SDS-PAGE of the final material on 15% acrylamide gels revealed a single band. The concentration of either yeast profilin or human profilin was determined spectrophotometrically using an Ïµ280 of 20,300 and 10,800 m-1 cm-1, respectively (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Purified profilins were stored at 4 Â°C.Etheno-ATP (ÏµATP)-bound Actin Preparation and Actin Binding AssayâÏµATP-bound G-actin was prepared as described by Wen (25Wen K.K. Yao X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41101-41109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the free nucleotide was removed from G-actin stock solutions by centrifugation through Zeba Desalting Spin Columns (Pierce) preequilibrated with G0 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 Â°C as described by the manufacturer's protocol. A 20 Î¼m G-actin solution in ATP-free G-buffer was incubated with ÏµATP (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 1 mm at 4 Â°C overnight. Unbound nucleotide was removed by desalting as above in the presence of 0.4 mm CaCl2, which was present throughout the remainder of the procedure. Thus, following the final desalting, the solution containing the 20 mm nucleotide-G-actin complex was in the presence of 0.4 mm CaCl2. Profilin at various concentrations was mixed at 25 Â°C in G0 buffer with 1 Î¼m ÏµATP G-actin to a final volume of 1.5 ml. Free ATP was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 250 Î¼m with constant stirring. Thus, at this time, for all experiments, the free Ca2+ was â¼150 mm for all reactions tested.The decrease in fluorescence due to the disassociation of actin-bound ÏµATP was monitored over time with a Fluorolog-3 instrument containing a thermostatted sample holder (Spex, Edison, NJ) at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 410 nm. The net fluorescence change was determined at each time point and normalized against the total fluorescence change at the end of the exchange. The actin-bound ÏµATP disassociation rate of each experiment was obtained by fitting each individual normalized data set to a single-exponential function by using Excel software (Microsoft).For assessing the effects of profilin on the nucleotide exchange rate, the data at different profilin concentrations were analyzed by Excel and fitted to Equation 1, kobs[A]T=ka[A]T+(kpa-ka)Â·(Kd+[P]+[A]T)-(Kd+[P]+[A]T)2-(4[P][A]T)2(Eq. 1) which is derived from Equation 2, kobs=ka[A][A]T+kpa[PA][A]T(Eq. 2) where kobs is the observed disassociation rate constant, ka is the disassociation rate constant of G-actin in the absence of profilin, kpa is the theoretical disassociation rate constant of the profilin-G-actin complex, [A]T is the concentration of total actin, [A] is the concentration of free G-actin, [P] is the concentration of free profilin, and Kd is the dissociation equilibrium constant of the complex. To obtain the best fit, kpa was subjected to the constraint that it is larger than ka.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)âITC measurements were performed using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). The concentrations of the profilin and actin were measured by UV absorption at 280 or 290 nm as described above, and the proteins were degassed before each experiment. Titrations were performed in 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The concentrations of profilin and the actin mutants varied among experiments, and all interactions were repeated two times. Heats of dilution were calculated by averaging the last 3-5 injections and then were subtracted from the raw data. The data sets were then analyzed individually using a single-site binding model from the ORIGIN ITC analysis software package provided by the VP-ITC calorimeter manufacturer. In this analysis, the values for stoichiometry (n), change in enthalpy (ÎH), and the affinity constant (Ka) were fit using nonlinear least squares analysis. The reported values for n, ÎH, and Ka are the average and S.D. of all injections for an individual interaction.Kinetics of Profilin Binding to G-actinâThe kinetics of the binding of profilin to G-actin was monitored over time by the decrease in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence caused by the interaction using a BioLogic SFM3 stopped-flow instrument (BioLogic). The data were further analyzed with Kinsim/Fitsim software (available on the World Wide Web) and fitted to the following model (Reaction 1),where A represents G-actin, P is profilin, and AP is the actin-profilin complex. The kinetic rate constants (kon and koff) of profilin binding to actin were obtained from the average of fitting data from at least three sets of experiments with different profilin concentrations. The Kd is calculated from the results of koff/kon.RESULTSOur goal was to determine the molecular basis underlying the ability of profilin to facilitate the exchange of nucleotide from actin. Toward this end, we analyzed the interaction of yeast and human profilins with yeast and muscle actin. These two actin isoforms are 87% identical in sequence (21Rubenstein P.A. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and they only vary in three residues in what is thought to constitute the profilin binding surface (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Residues Glu167, Tyr169, and Arg372 in muscle actin are replaced by Ala167, Phe169, and His372 in yeast actin, respectively.We first assessed the rate of nucleotide exchange brought about by increasing concentrations of profilin in the presence of a constant amount of actin. In this analysis, the Kd for the actin-profilin interaction can be derived from the first-order rate constants for the decrease in fluorescence resulting from the exchange of bound ÏµATP from the actin surface. This analysis has been used previously (5Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and is described under âMaterials and Methods.â Fig. 1A shows the increase in nucleotide exchange rate from yeast actin caused by saturating concentrations of yeast profilin (YPF) and human profilin 1 (HPF1). HPF1 produces a 10-fold increase in this rate, whereas YPF produces only a 4-fold acceleration (Table 1). For muscle actin with YPF, there was 3-fold activation (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and with HPF1 and muscle actin, there was a 35-fold enhancement (data not shown). Clearly, the small enhancement of nucleotide exchange previously observed with yeast actin and yeast profilin does not result from some maximal rate at which a yeast actin can exchange nucleotide due to its inherently more open conformation (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Belmont L.D. Orlova A. Drubin D.G. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). HPF1, at saturating conditions, is simply a better catalyst of nucleotide exchange than YPF, whether yeast or muscle actin is utilized.TABLE 1Experimental parameters for the actin-bound âATP exchange for the profilin-actin isoform interactionYPFHPF1-Fold increasea-Fold increase: k (profilin at saturating concentration)/k (no profilin).KdbKd is obtained from fitting the data described in the legend to Fig. 1B with Equation 1 as described under âMaterials and Methods.âEfficiencycEfficiency = -fold increase in exchange rate/Kd.-Fold increaseKdEfficiency-foldÎ¼mÎ¼mâ1-foldÎ¼mÎ¼mâ1Yeast actin40.6dIn our case, the binding of YPF to yeast actin is about 3-fold stronger than previously determined (17).6.7103.23a -Fold increase: k (profilin at saturating concentration)/k (no profilin).b Kd is obtained from fitting the data described in the legend to Fig. 1B with Equation 1 as described under âMaterials and Methods.âc Efficiency = -fold increase in exchange rate/Kd.d In our case, the binding of YPF to yeast actin is about 3-fold stronger than previously determined (17Eads J.C.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 1B shows the rate constants calculated from curves similar to those described in Fig. 1A for the interaction of different concentrations of YPF or HPF1 with yeast actin. Table 1 shows that like the case involving the two profilins with muscle actin (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the homologous pair had a Kd about 5 times stronger than that exhibited by the heterologous pair. However, it is apparent from the data that Kd and rate catalytic ability do not strictly correlate.A better measure of catalytic activity with respect to enzyme function is the catalytic efficiency or kcat/Kd, since most enzymes do not work at saturating conditions. This may very well be the case in vivo for profilins (16Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 27Magdolen V. Drubin D.G. Mages G. Bandlow W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To apply this analysis to the profilin/actin system, for a given actin, we divided the -fold enhancement of rate exchange by the Kd for the particular actin-profilin pair. With yeast actin, this efficiency measure was 6.7 Î¼m-1 for YPF and only 3 Î¼m-1 for HPF1 (Table 1). Based on the data referred to above, the catalytic efficiency for the HPF1-muscle actin pair is 350 Î¼m-1. From the work of Eads et al. (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the catalytic efficiency of the YPF-muscle actin pair is about 1 Î¼m-1. In summary, the homologous set of proteins was always more efficient than the heterologous pair.We next used ITC to examine the energetics that characterized the interaction of yeast actin with yeast and human profilins. Fig. 2A shows the experimental data for the repeated injection of YPF into a solution of yeast actin, and Fig. 2B presents the corrected integrated data with a curve fit for the data in Fig. 2A. Values for ÎH and TÎS were then extracted from these data as described under âMaterials and Methods.â Table 2 shows these values along with the corresponding values for Ka or Kd for the interaction of yeast and human profilins with yeast actin. For the sake of comparison, values obtained previously for the interaction of these two profilins with muscle actin are shown (17Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). With both actins, the interaction with YPF is strongly enthalpically driven. The change in entropy is actually unfavorable. Conversely, for HPF1, although the change in enthalpy is favorable, it is much less so than for yeast actin. This lower ÎH, however, is offset by a favorable change in entropy. The data demonstrate that the nature of the profilin isoform and not the actin isoform appears to dictate the energetics that characterize the interaction of these two proteins. It is interesting that the nature of the interactions is so different, considering that the profilin binding surface on actin is very much alike for the different isoforms involved.FIGURE 2ITC analysis for the interaction of yeast WT actin with yeast profilin.

In comparison with YPF, mammalian profilins contain an extra loop between Leu78 and Asp86. Based on the Î²-actin-bovine profilin co-crystal (18Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), Glu82 in this loop might form a hydrogen bond with actin Lys113 in subdomain 1, which is conserved in both yeast and muscle actins, as shown in Fig. 3. Lys113 is located on the back face of the actin monomer close to His73 and the hinge region. This extra actin Lys113-profilin Glu82 hydrogen bond interaction might enhance the ability of profilin to open the actin cleft, leading to the greater rate of exchange that is observed. To test this hypothesis, we mutated HPF1 Glu82 to Lys, Ser, or Ala and assessed the actin-bound ÏµATP release rate in the presence of the mutant profilins. Fig. 4 demonstrates that at saturating concentrations, all three mutant profilins facilitate the yeast actin nucleotide exchange 9-13-fold, respectively, similar to the value obtained with WT HPF1. The mutations also cause little if any effect on the Kd for the actin-profilin interactions (data not shown). A similar enhancement for muscle actin-bound ATP was also observed (data not shown). Thus, the ability to form this postulated hydrogen bond is not critical for catalysis of nucleotide exchange or for the affinity of the interaction (data not shown).FIGURE 3Location of actin Lys113 and profilin Glu82 in the actin-profilin complex.

We found that BHLHB3 transcript levels were low in three human lung cancer cell lines and downregulated in human lung adenocarcinomas as compared to normal lung tissue. BHLHB3 gene overexpression inhibited colony formation of A549, NCI-H520 and NCI-H596 lung cancer cells. The reduced colony growth was likely due to inhibition of cell proliferation as suggested by the downregulation of cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression in NCI-H520 cells transfected to overexpress the BHLHB3 gene; no evidence of apoptosis was observed. These results point to the potential role of the BHLHB3 protein as a tumor suppressor for lung cancer."

Tax, unlike all the other upstream stimuli such as NFÎºB-inducing kinase, MEK kinase 1, and transforming growth factor Î²-activated kinase 1, is not a kinase that phosphorylates and activates the IKK complex. It activates the complex by direct interaction via a mechanism not clearly understood. It has been proposed that Tax activates the NFÎºB pathway by inducing a conformational change onto IKK (5Harhaj E.W. Harhaj N.S. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified several binding partners for Tax, such as MEK kinase 1 (6Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y.

The catalytic subunit of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was recently identified to bind Tax directly, and it was demonstrated that Tax forms a ternary complex together with IKKÎ³ and PP2A (7Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).

Based on these studies, two models have been proposed to explain the regulation of the IKK complex by Tax in conjunction with PP2A (7Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol.

According to one model, Tax binding to PP2A relieves negative inhibition on the IKK complex, resulting in an active IKK complex (7Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, another group has demonstrated that PP2A positively regulates IÎºB kinase signaling, i.e. IKK-PP2A complexes are essential for IKK activation (9Kray A.E. Carter R.S. Pennington K.N.

In contrast to the viral pathogen human T-cell leukemia virus type-1, the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis, the causal agent for bubonic plague, inhibits the NFÎºB pathway (10Viboud G.I.

Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Yersinia species use the bacterial virulence factor YopJ to block all MAPK and NFÎºB pathways at a common point (11Orth K.

Recent studies revealed that YopJ functions as an acetyltransferase (13Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K.

It blocks the activation of all MAPK kinases, including IKKÎ², by the addition of an acetyl group to the highly conserved serine and threonine residues in the activation loop of the kinase. Acetylation of these residues by YopJ prevents the activation of these kinases by inhibiting phosphorylation. Previously, overexpression studies have shown that YopJ inhibits Tax-mediated activation of the IKK complex (15Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Arrate P. Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

To decipher the requirements of Tax-induced NFÎºB signaling, we have developed an in vitro signaling assay to analyze the activation of the IKK complex by Tax. The assay utilizes wild type and mutant recombinant Tax proteins, an S100 lysate containing unstimulated IKK complex, and a readout for the activation of the NFÎºB pathway, phospho-IÎºB. The mutant Tax proteins that we have used in our assays include M22, H41Q, H43Q, and K85N. Fu et al. (7Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the ability to induce NFÎºB activation is abrogated in the M22 mutant whereas the other three mutants are defective in binding PP2A and also fail to activate the NFÎºB pathway. Based on their study, they proposed that binding of Tax to PP2A is essential for NFÎºB activation. Herein, we find that activation of the NFÎºB pathway by recombinant Tax does not require binding to or the activity of PP2A but is dependent on an intact Hsp90-IKK complex. Recombinant Tax is unable to activate the IKK complex in an S100 lysate that contains the acetyltransferase YopJ. Based on results from transcription reporter assays and our in vitro signaling system, we propose that the activation of the IKK complex by human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 Tax requires both a signaling complex containing functional chaperone Hsp90 and an activation loop on IKKÎ² that is required for phosphorylation. This in vitro signaling assay will thus allow us to dissect the mechanism of Tax-dependent activation of IKK. Plasmids and ReagentsâTax was cloned into pET28a and pcDNA3 vectors using 5â²-BamH1 and 3â²-Xho1. The four Tax mutant constructs, M22, H41Q, H43Q, and K85N, in pET28a and pcDNA3 vectors were created using the Stratagene mutagenesis kit with the following pair of oligonucleotides: M22, 5â²-ACC CTT GGG CAG CAC CTC CCA AGC GCG TCT TTT CCA GAC CCC GGA CTC, M22, 3â²-GAG TCC GGG GTC TGG AAA AGA CGC GCT TGG GAG GTG CTG CCC AAG GGT; H41Q, 5â²-GGA CTA TGT TCG GCC CGC CTA CAG CGT CAC GCC CTA CTG GCC ACC, H41Q, 3â²-GGT GGC CAG TAG GGC GTG ACG CTG TAG GCG GGC CGA ACA TAG TCC; H43Q, 5â²-GGA CTA TGT TCG GCC CGC CTA CAT CGT CAG GCC CTA CTG GCC ACC, H43Q, 3â²-GGT GGC CAG TAG GGC CTG ACG ATG TAG GCG GGC CGA ACA TAG TCC; K85N, 5â²-TTC CCC ACC CAG AGA ACC TCT AAT ACC CTC AAG GTC CTT ACC CCG, K85N, 3â²-CGG GGT AAG GAC CTT GAG GGT ATT AGA GGT TCT CTG GGT GGG GAA. pcDNA3-FLAG-IÎºB was kindly provided by Dr. Zhijian Chen. pSFFV YopJ-FLAG, pSFFV YopJC172A-FLAG, and 5xNFÎºB luciferase reporter were described previously (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-IÎºB antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling, and anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma. Antibodies to Hsp90 and IKKÎ² were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein A-agarose beads were purchased from Invitrogen. Geldanamycin and okadaic acid were purchased from Alexis. pNPP was obtained from Sigma. Expression and Purification of Recombinant ProteinsâWild type and the various mutants of Tax (M22, H41Q, H43Q, and K85N) were expressed as His-tagged proteins in Rosetta (Invitrogen) cells, grown to an O.D. of 0.6â0.8, and induced at room temperature with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside for 8â12 h. The bacterial pellet was then lysed by an Emulsiflex C5 cell disruptor (Avestin) and purified using standard protocols for Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid purification (Qiagen). Recombinant TRAF6 was used as a positive control and was purified from Sf9 cells as described in Li et al. (16Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Anti-Tax was used as previously described (17Lee B. Tanaka Y. Tozawa H. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1989; 157: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Tissue Culture and Lysate PreparationâHEK293 or HeLa cells were cultured in DulbeccoÅs modified EagleÅs medium supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen) in the presence of 5% CO2. For the in vitro assays, untransfected HeLa cells or HEK293 cells transfected with 10 Î¼g of pSFFV, pSFFV-YopJ-FLAG, or pSFFV-YopJC172A-FLAG using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) were grown up to 100% confluency, harvested using phosphate-buffered saline-EDTA, and lysed with equal volume of HTX lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EGTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) by incubating on ice for 20â60 min. Lysate was spun sequentially at 800, 10,000, and then 100,000 Ã g to obtain a cleared S100 lysate that was then stored at -80 Â°C at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Luciferase and Transfection AssaysâHEK293 cells were transfected with 200 ng of WT Tax or the different Tax mutants (M22, H41Q, H43Q, and K85N) and 5xNFÎºB luciferase reporter in the absence or presence of pSFFV YopJ-FLAG or pSFFV YopJC172A-FLAG for 24 h using FuGENE transfection reagent. Each plate was also transfected with pRSV-Renilla to serve as the internal standard control. Lysates were prepared using passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase assays were performed using Fluostar Optima (BMG Labtech). For in vivo activation of the NFÎºB pathway, HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-WT-Tax or mutant Tax and pcDNA3-FLAG-IÎºB in the absence or presence of 100 ng of pSFFV-YopJ-FLAG or pSFFV-YopJC172A-FLAG. 36 h post-transfection, cells were lysed with HNT lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm Î²-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.5 mm EGTA. Lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-IÎºB, anti-FLAG, and anti-Tax antibodies. pNPP AssayâA 1:50 dilution of Hela-S3 cell-free lysate was incubated in the absence or presence of 10 nm okadaic acid. The 96-well microtiter plate assay (Upstate Biotechnology) was carried out in triplicate according to the manufacturerÅs description. The absorbance at wavelength 410 nm was read using a FluoStar Optima (BMG Labtech). In Vitro Assay Using Recombinant TaxâCleared lysates (10 mg/ml) were incubated with or without 2 Î¼m recombinant WT Tax and/or all the mutants or 1 Î¼m TRAF6 in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (10Ã stock: 10 mm ATP, 350 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 500 Î¼g/ml creatine kinase) for 10 min at 37 Â°C. 0.5 Î¼m okadaic acid and 2 Î¼m geldanamycin were added to cleared lysates before the addition of the recombinant protein. Reactions were terminated by addition of 5Ã SDS sample buffer. Proteins from the reaction samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. IKK activation was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-IÎºB antibody. For in vitro assays using Hsp90-immunodepleted lysate, lysates were incubated with anti-Hsp90 antibody for 1 h at 4 Â°C, followed by incubation with 30 Î¼l of Protein A-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 Â°C. This step was performed twice to ensure complete immunodepletion of Hsp90. The lysates were finally incubated with Tax or TRAF6 recombinant proteins. In vitro kinase assays were performed on immunoprecipitated complexes as previously described using [Î³-32P]ATP and GST-IkBÎ±-(1â52) as the recombinant substrate (11Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In Vitro Activation of the NFÎºB Pathway by Recombinant Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type-1 TaxâWe previously established an assay to study the activation of MAPK and NFÎºB signaling pathways in vitro (13Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The assay is initiated by the addition of a partially purified activator of a signaling pathway to an S100 lysate in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, followed by termination of the reaction by addition of SDS sample buffer. The activation of the signaling pathway is assessed by analysis of a downstream indicator by immunoblotting for a phosphorylated protein. Herein, we analyzed the activation of the NFÎºB pathway by the addition of partially purified recombinant WT His6-Tax protein to the unstimulated S100 lysate (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Addition of Tax protein (2 Î¼m) to cleared lysate results in the activation of the NFÎºB pathway as indicated by robust phosphorylation of IÎºB (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Similarly, addition of 1 Î¼m partially purified recombinant TRAF6 (Fig. 1A, lane 6), which served as the positive control in this assay, also activates the NFÎºB pathway (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Using serial dilutions of WT recombinant Tax added to the in vitro signaling system, we demonstrate that the activation of the NFÎºB pathway is detected with as little as 800 nm Tax (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2In vitro activation of NFÎºB pathway by recombinant Tax and TRAF6.A, IKK activation by wild type (wt) Tax and TRAF6 using in vitro signaling assay.

The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that WT His6-Tax protein is activating the IKK complex specifically, we activated lysates with WT His6-Tax protein followed by immunoprecipitation of the IKK complex using antibodies for IKKÎ³ or Tax (Fig. 2C). The isolated signaling complexes were tested for radioactive kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay using GST-IÎºBÎ±-(1â52) as the substrate. Identical phosphorylated protein profiles were observed from signaling complexes isolated using either anti-IKKÎ³ or anti-Tax antibodies, demonstrating that Tax is binding to and activating the IKK complex (Fig. 2C). As expected, only complexes isolated from the Tax-activated lysates were able to phosphorylate GST-IÎºBÎ± (Fig. 2, B and C). Tax-mediated Activation of NFÎºB Pathway Is Independent of Binding to PhosphatasesâTo determine the role of phosphatases in the activation of the NFÎºB pathway by Tax, several previously described mutants of Tax (7Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were used in our in vivo and in vitro signaling assays. The effect on the activation of the NFÎºB pathway by wild type and mutant Tax proteins was first analyzed using transfection-based luciferase assays with an NFÎºB luciferase reporter (Fig. 3A). The activation of the NFÎºB pathway by the various Tax mutants was also analyzed by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-phospho-IÎºB antibody (Fig. 3B). We observed that the M22 mutant, which has previously been described as the inactive form of Tax, fails to induce activation of the NFÎºB pathway, and these findings are consistent with previous studies in which this mutant was shown to be unable to activate the NFÎºB pathway (Fig. 3, A and B) (7Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Tax mutants H41Q, H43Q, and K85N activated the NFÎºB pathway to varying levels, based on both the luciferase assays and the immunoblotting for phospho-IÎºB (Fig. 3, A and B). For the latter experiment, cells were constitutively expressed with FLAG-IÎºB to detect phosphorylation of exogenous IÎºB, because endogenous IÎºB is degraded upon activation of the NFÎºB pathway (13Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The mutants H43Q and K85N were not detected using the anti-Tax antibody because of their decreased expression levels in the mammalian system (Fig. 3B) (17Lee B. Tanaka Y. Tozawa H. Tohoku J. Exp. Med. 1989; 157: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because H41Q, H43Q, and K85N, which are defective in binding PP2A, were able to activate the NFÎºB pathway, the binding of PP2A to Tax does not appear to be essential for Tax-mediated activation of the IKK complex (7Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Tax mutants were also expressed as recombinant His-tagged proteins in bacteria and purified using nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A). The anti-Tax antibody was able to immunoreact with all the recombinant proteins (Fig. 1B). Consistent with previous in vivo observations, addition of the recombinant inactive mutant form of Tax (M22) to the in vitro signaling system was unable to induce phosphorylation of IÎºB (Fig. 4A, lane 5). However, addition of the three recombinant mutant forms of Tax including H41Q, H43Q, and K85N, which are unable to bind PP2A, resulted in activation of the NFÎºB pathway as indicated by phosphorylation of IÎºB in vitro, albeit with varying potency (Fig. 4A, lanes 3, 4, and 6). The profiles of partially purified wild type Tax and the inactive mutant M22 proteins (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2) appear the same, supporting the proposal that differences in the activities can be attributed to the mutated amino acids in the various Tax proteins. Overall, these observations do not support the first model, in that binding of PP2A to Tax is not essential for Tax activation of the IKK complex (7Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Tax-mediated Activation of the NFÎºB Pathway Is Independent of Active PhosphatasesâTo further assess whether PP2A plays a positive role in the in vitro activation of the IKK complex by Tax, the in vitro activation of the NFÎºB pathway was analyzed in the presence of okadaic acid (OA). Addition of 10 nm OA (or 500 nm, data not shown) did not alter the ability of wild type Tax to activate the IKK complex as observed by phosphorylation of IÎºB (Fig. 4B, lane 4). At this very low concentration of OA (10 nm), PP2A activity is effectively repressed in the lysate (Fig. 4C). Therefore, when PP2A activity is inhibited, Tax is still able to activate the IKK complex. As expected, there was no change in IÎºB phosphorylation levels upon addition of TRAF6 to the lysate in the presence of OA (Fig. 4B, lane 6). Based on these observations, Tax can activate the IKK complex independent of PP2A activity, thereby discounting the second model that predicted that the interaction between IKK and PP2A is essential for Tax to be able to activate the IKK complex (9Kray A.E. Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Gomez R.J. Sanders L.E. Llanes J.M. Khan W.N. Ballard D.W. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35974-35982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hsp90 Is Essential for Tax-mediated Activation of the IKK ComplexâStudies were initiated to further understand the requirements for activation of the IKK complex by Tax. The in vitro signaling system recapitulated the activation of the NFÎºB pathway by Tax and also demonstrated that Tax-mediated IKK activation is independent of phosphatases. It is possible that by binding to IKKÎ³, Tax is inducing a conformational change that results in the activation of the IKK complex (5Harhaj E.W. Harhaj N.S. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hsp90, which is known to maintain the structural integrity of protein complexes (18Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), is an integral component of the IKK complex (19Broemer M. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5378-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To test whether Hsp90 plays a role in Tax-mediated activation of the NFÎºB pathway in vitro, geldanamycin (GA), an Hsp90-specific inhibitor, was used in the in vitro signaling system. Upon addition of 2 Î¼m GA to the in vitro signaling assay, it was observed that Tax could no longer activate IKK as indicated by the lack of IÎºB phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lane 4). GA also inhibited the TRAF6-dependent activation of the IKK complex (Fig. 5A, lane 7). This is consistent with previous observations where GA-dependent Hsp90 inhibition has been shown to interfere with IKK activation (19Broemer M. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5378-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To further assess the effect of Hsp90 on Tax-mediated NFÎºB activation, we used lysate, immunodepleted for Hsp90 (Fig. 5B), in our in vitro cell-free signaling assay. Addition of recombinant Tax and TRAF6 proteins to Hsp90-immunodepleted lysate failed to activate the NFÎºB pathway as shown by immunoblotting against phospho-IÎºB (Fig. 5C, lanes 5 and 6). Because Hsp90 is known to maintain the structural integrity of protein complexes, these observations support a new model that a preformed native complex requiring active Hsp90 is essential for the activation of the IKK complex by Tax. This supports the proposed model that binding of Tax to IKKÎ³ in the IKK complex causes a conformational change that induces autoactivation of the kinases in the complex (5Harhaj E.W. Harhaj N.S. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Tax Cannot Bypass Inhibition of the IKK Complex by YopJ AcetylationâTax is one of the upstream activators of the IKK complex; however, the mechanism by which it activates IKK has not been completely deciphered. The effector protein YopJ from Yersinia was recently shown to inhibit MAPK kinase and IKK activation by acetylating the conserved serine and threonine residues in the activation loop of the kinase (13Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 14Mittal R. Peak-Chew S.Y. McMahon H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18574-18579Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 20Mukherjee S. Hao Y.H. Orth K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings, YopJ inhibited IKK activation by Tax, as shown by using a NFÎºB luciferase reporter (Fig. 6A) (15Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Arrate P. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48903-48906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive mutant YopJC172A, however, had no effect on Tax-mediated activation of NFÎºB (Fig. 6A). Transfection experiments with YopJ and Tax followed by immunoblotting with antibody against phospho-IÎºB further confirmed these results because YopJ, but not YopJC172A, inhibited Tax-mediated IÎºB phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). As before, cells constitutively expressed FLAG-IÎºB to detect phosphorylation of exogenous IÎºB. YopJ Inhibits in Vitro Activation of IKK by TaxâTo gain insight into the mechanism used by Tax, in vitro assay of Tax-mediated IKK activation was utilized. 10 mg/ml membrane-cleared lysate was prepared from cells transfected with vector (V), YopJ (J), or YopJC172A (C/A) plasmids (13Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Recombinant WT Tax was then used to activate these lysates. Tax was able to phosphorylate endogenous IÎºBin both V- and C/A-transfected cell lysates (Fig. 6C). By contrast and as expected, Tax had lost its ability to phosphorylate IÎºB from cells expressing YopJ. The results from this in vitro assay confirm the above in vivo results and are in accordance with the work by Carter et al. (15Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Ungurait B.J. Arrate P. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48903-48906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Just like all other upstream stimuli, YopJ is able to block the Tax-mediated activation of the IKK complex. In this study, an in vitro signaling assay was used to analyze the activation of IKK by Tax. Recombinant Tax, purified from bacteria, was able to efficiently induce IÎºB phosphorylation in cleared lysates. The phosphorylation profiles of the Tax-activated complexes isolated by immunoprecipitation with IKKÎ³ or Tax appear the same, supporting the accepted hypothesis that Tax, IKKÎ³, and the IKKs are parts of the same signaling complex. The PP2A binding-deficient mutants of Tax were also able to activate NFÎºB signaling, although not as strongly as WT Tax. These observations do not support the model that the binding of PP2A to Tax is essential for Tax-mediated activation of the IKK complex (7Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments with okadaic acid added to the in vitro assay did not alter the ability of WT Tax to activate the IKK complex and therefore do not support the alternative model that Tax-mediated IKK activation is positively regulated by PP2A (9Kray A.E. Carter R.S. Pennington K.N. Gomez R.J. Sanders L.E. Llanes J.M. Khan W.N. Ballard D.W. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35974-35982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By contrast, Tax was unable to activate the NFÎºB pathway when Hsp90, an integral component of the IKK complex, was inhibited by the addition of geldanamycin to the assay. Binding of Tax to IKKÎ³ in the IKK complex may cause a conformational change that induces autoactivation of the kinases in the complex. As more mutants associated with the other activities of viral Tax are discovered (21Nejmeddine M. Barnard A.L. Tanaka Y. Taylor G.P. Bangham C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29653-29660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), this system can be used to diagnose their role in the activation of IKK. Both in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that YopJ blocks the activation of IKK by Tax. YopJ leads to the acetylation of the conserved serine and threonine in the activation loop of kinases, including IKK. When the activation loop residues are acetylated, they can no longer be phosphorylated and the kinase cannot be activated (13Mukherjee S. Keitany G. Li Y. Wang Y. Ball H.L. Goldsmith E.J. Orth K. Science. 2006; 312: 1211-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 14Mittal R. Peak-Chew S.Y. McMahon H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18574-18579Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 20Mukherjee S. Hao Y.H. Orth K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The acetyltransferase activity of YopJ on IKK thus competes against phosphorylation of IKK by upstream kinases. As YopJ inhibits Tax-mediated IKK activation, these studies strongly indicate that phosphorylation of IKK is a key intermediate step in the activation of IKK by Tax. Our results support previously postulated mechanisms for Tax-mediated activation of the IKK complex, including induction of a conformational change or recruitment of an upstream kinase (5Harhaj E.W. Harhaj N.S. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The in vitro signaling system used in this study in combination with a number of inhibitors and activators has been useful for the elucidation of the biochemical mechanism of Tax-induced activation of the IKK complex. Based on these studies, a model is proposed whereby Tax-dependent activation of the IKK complex requires active Hsp90 and phosphorylation of IKK. Future biochemical studies that further dissect this mechanism may reveal other factors that are essential for the activation of the IKK complex by Tax.
