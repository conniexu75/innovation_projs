https://openalex.org/W2082349588,"Hydrogen sensors and hydrogen-activated switches were fabricated from arrays of mesoscopic palladium wires. These palladium ""mesowire"" arrays were prepared by electrodeposition onto graphite surfaces and were transferred onto a cyanoacrylate film. Exposure to hydrogen gas caused a rapid (less than 75 milliseconds) reversible decrease in the resistance of the array that correlated with the hydrogen concentration over a range from 2 to 10%. The sensor response appears to involve the closing of nanoscopic gaps or ""break junctions"" in wires caused by the dilation of palladium grains undergoing hydrogen absorption. Wire arrays in which all wires possessed nanoscopic gaps reverted to open circuits in the absence of hydrogen gas."

It is thought that they possess no degradative capability and that they are unable to decompose complex organic molecules, the form in which most soil nutrients occur. Earlier suggestions that they could exist saprotrophically were based on observation of hyphal proliferation on organic materials3,4. In contrast, other mycorrhizal types have been shown to acquire nitrogen directly from organic sources5,6,7. Here we show that the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis can both enhance decomposition of and increase nitrogen capture from complex organic material (grass leaves) in soil. Hyphal growth of the fungal partner was increased in the presence of the organic material, independently of the host plant."

We report that mice lacking gammadelta cells are highly susceptible to multiple regimens of cutaneous carcinogenesis. After exposure to carcinogens, skin cells expressed Rae-1 and H60, major histocompatibility complex-related molecules structurally resembling human MICA. Each of these is a ligand for NKG2d, a receptor expressed by cytolytic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. In vitro, skin-associated NKG2d+ gammadelta cells killed skin carcinoma cells by a mechanism that was sensitive to blocking NKG2d engagement. Thus, local T cells may use evolutionarily conserved proteins to negatively regulate malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2009871519,"The parent compounds of the copper oxide high-Tc superconductors are unusual insulators. Superconductivity arises when they are properly doped away from stoichiometry1. In Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, superconductivity results from doping with excess oxygen atoms, which introduce positive charge carriers (holes) into the CuO2 planes, where superconductivity is believed to originate. The role of these oxygen dopants is not well understood, other than the fact that they provide charge carriers. However, it is not even clear how these charges distribute in the CuO2 planes. Accordingly, many models of high-Tc superconductors simply assume that the charge carriers introduced by doping distribute uniformly, leading to an electronically homogeneous system, as in ordinary metals. Here we report the observation of an electronic inhomogeneity in the high-Tc superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x using scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy. This inhomogeneity is manifested as spatial variations in both the local density of states spectrum and the superconducting energy gap. These variations are correlated spatially and vary on a surprisingly short length scale of ~ 14 Angs. Analysis suggests that the inhomogeneity observed is a consequence of proximity to a Mott insulator resulting in poor screening of the charge potentials associated with the oxygen ions left behind in the BiO plane after doping. Hence this experiment is a direct probe of the local nature of the superconducting state, which is not easily accessible by macroscopic measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2073640257,"Positional information is pivotal for establishing developmental patterning in plants, but little is known about the underlying signalling mechanisms. The Arabidopsis root radial pattern is generated through stereotyped division of initial cells and the subsequent acquisition of cell fate. short-root (shr) mutants do not undergo the longitudinal cell division of the cortex/endodermis initial daughter cell, resulting in a single cell layer with only cortex attributes. Thus, SHR is necessary for both cell division and endodermis specification. SHR messenger RNA is found exclusively in the stele cells internal to the endodermis and cortex, indicating that it has a non-cell-autonomous mode of action. Here we show that the SHR protein, a putative transcription factor, moves from the stele to a single layer of adjacent cells, where it enters the nucleus. Ectopic expression of SHR driven by the promoter of the downstream gene SCARECROW (SCR) results in autocatalytic reinforcement of SHR signalling, producing altered cell fates and multiplication of cell layers. These results support a model in which SHR protein acts both as a signal from the stele and as an activator of endodermal cell fate and SCR-mediated cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2068474779,"Species richness in the tropics has been attributed to the gradual accumulation of species over a long geological period in stable equatorial climates or, conversely, to speciation in response to late Tertiary geological events and unstable Pleistocene climates. DNA sequence data are consistent with recent diversification in Inga, a species-rich neotropical tree genus. We estimate that speciation was concentrated in the past 10 million years, with many species arising as recently as 2 million years ago. This coincides with the more recent major uplifts of the Andes, the bridging of the Isthmus of Panama, and Quaternary glacial cycles. Inga may be representative of other species-rich neotropical genera with rapid growth and reproduction, which contribute substantially to species numbers in the world's most diverse flora."

https://openalex.org/W1974651731,"A classic model proposes that the mammalian neocortex is divided into areas early in neurogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms that generate the area map have been elusive. Here we provide evidence that FGF8 regulates development of the map from a source in the anterior telencephalon. Using electroporation-mediated gene transfer in mouse embryos, we show that augmenting the endogenous anterior FGF8 signal shifts area boundaries posteriorly, reducing the signal shifts them anteriorly, and introducing a posterior source of FGF8 elicits partial area duplications, revealed by ectopic somatosensory barrel fields. These findings support a role for FGF signaling in specifying positional identity in the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2039819049,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by multiple clinical features that include pigmentary retinal dystrophy, polydactyly, obesity, developmental delay, and renal defects. BBS is considered an autosomal recessive disorder, and recent positional cloning efforts have identified two BBS genes (BBS2 and BBS6). We screened our cohort of 163 BBS families for mutations in both BBS2 and BBS6 and report the presence of three mutant alleles in affected individuals in four pedigrees. In addition, we detected unaffected individuals in two pedigrees who carry two BBS2 mutations but not a BBS6 mutation. We therefore propose that BBS may not be a single-gene recessive disease but a complex trait requiring three mutant alleles to manifest the phenotype. This triallelic model of disease transmission may be important in the study of both Mendelian and multifactorial disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2107435587,"Fatty acids are synthesized <i>de novo</i> from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA through a series of reactions mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). In rodents, the principal fatty acid produced by FAS is palmitic acid (16:0). Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) enhance the transcription of many genes responsible for fatty acid synthesis. In transgenic mice that overexpress SREBPs in liver, the rate of fatty acid synthesis is markedly increased, owing to the activation of these biosynthetic genes, which include ATP citrate lyase, ACC, FAS, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase. The fatty acids that accumulate in livers of SREBP transgenic mice are 18 carbons rather than 16 carbons in length, suggesting that the enzymes required for the elongation of palmitic to stearic acid may be induced. Here, we report the cDNA cloning of a murine long chain fatty acyl elongase (LCE) that was identified initially by oligonucleotide array analysis of mRNA from SREBP transgenic mouse livers. LCE mRNA is highly expressed in liver and adipose tissue. The cDNA encodes a protein of 267 amino acids that shares sequence identity with previously identified very long chain fatty acid elongases. Cells that overexpress LCE show enhanced addition of 2-carbon units to C12-C16 fatty acids. We provide evidence that LCE catalyzes the rate-limiting condensing step in this reaction. The current studies suggest that mouse LCE expression is increased by SREBPs and that the enzyme is a component of the elusive mammalian elongation system that converts palmitic to stearic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1994603967,"Î²-1,3-d-Glucans are biological response modifiers with potent effects on the immune system. A number of receptors are thought to play a role in mediating these responses, including murine Dectin-1, which we recently identified as a Î²-glucan receptor. In this study we describe the characterization of the human homologue of this receptor and show that it is structurally and functionally similar to the mouse receptor. The human Î²-glucan receptor is a type II transmembrane receptor with a single extracellular carbohydrate recognition domain and an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif in its cytoplasmic tail. The human Î²-glucan receptor is widely expressed and functions as a pattern recognition receptor, recognizing a variety of Î²-1,3- and/or Î²-1,6-linked glucans as well as intact yeast. In contrast to the murine receptor, the human receptor mRNA is alternatively spliced, resulting in two major (A and B) and six minor isoforms. The two major isoforms differ by the presence of a stalk region separating the carbohydrate recognition domain from the transmembrane region and are the only isoforms that are functional for Î²-glucan binding. The human receptor also binds T-lymphocytes at a site distinct from the Î²-glucan binding site, indicating that this receptor can recognize both endogenous and exogenous ligands. Î²-1,3-d-Glucans are biological response modifiers with potent effects on the immune system.

Janeway Jr., C.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). These polymers belong to a class of drugs known as biological response modifiers and have a variety of effects on the immune system, including antitumor (2Ross G.D. Vetvicka V. Yan J. Xia Y. Vetvickova J. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and anti-infective activities, protecting against fungal (3Williams D.L. Cook J.A. Hoffmann E.O. Di Luzio N.R. J. Reticuloendothel. Soc. 1978; 23: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar), bacterial (4Kokoshis P.L. Williams D.L. Cook J.A. Di Luzio N.R. Science. 1978; 199: 1340-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), viral (5Itoh W. Mediat. Inflamm. 1997; 6: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and protozoal infections (6Cook J.A. Holbrook T.W. Dougherty W.J. Infect. Immun. 1982; 37: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both particulate and soluble Î²-glucans mediate these activities by activating leukocytes and stimulating their phagocytic activity and the production of reactive oxygen intermediates, inflammatory mediators, and cytokines (7Williams D.L. Mueller A. Browder W. Clin. Immunother. 1996; 5: 392-399Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Czop J.K. Pathol. Immunopathol. Res. 1986; 5: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Despite the wealth of knowledge regarding the effects of Î²-glucans and their obvious therapeutic potential, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these responses are not well understood. Receptors on leukocytes that recognize Î²-glucans were originally described over 20 years ago as phagocytic receptors for particulate activators of the alternative complement pathway (9Czop J.K. Fearon D.T. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1978; 120: 1132-1138PubMed Google Scholar). At least four receptors have subsequently been identified: complement receptor 3, lactosylceramide, scavenger receptors, and Dectin-1. In addition to the iC3b binding site, complement receptor 3 possesses a lectin site for Î²-glucans that, in combination with iC3b, enhances phagocytic and cytotoxic responses (10Ross G.D. Cain J.A. Lachmann P.J. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3307-3315PubMed Google Scholar, 11Thornton B.P. Vetvicka V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar). Î²-Glucans can also prime the receptor for subsequent iC3b-mediated cytotoxic responses, including the iC3b-restricted antitumor activity (12Vetvicka V. Thornton B.P. Ross G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Lactosylceramide (CDw17), a major glycosphingolipid of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and selected scavenger receptors have also been identified as receptors for Î²-glucans, although their role in Î²-glucan-mediated responses is less clear (13Zimmerman J.W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We recently identified Dectin-1 as a Î²-glucan receptor from a murine macrophage (MÏ)1 cDNA expression library screened with a Î²-glucan-rich particle, zymosan (15Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The receptor possessed a single C-type lectin-like carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) connected to the transmembrane region by a stalk and a cytoplasmic tail possessing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). Dectin-1 was found to be widely expressed in mouse tissues and acted as a pattern recognition receptor, recognizing a variety of carbohydrates containing Î²-1,3- and/or Î²-1,6-glucan linkages and intact Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand Candida albicans (15Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). In addition, the receptor bound T-lymphocytes (16Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Shikano S. Xu S. Ritter III, R. Kumamoto T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20157-20167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) but at a site distinct from that which recognized Î²-glucans (15Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). We had originally identified a human homologue of Dectin-1 that lacked a stalk region between the CRD and transmembrane region (15Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Preliminary analysis suggested that this receptor may function in an analogous fashion to Dectin-1 in that it was able to recognize zymosan and intact yeast. Another human Dectin-1 isoform, possessing a stalk region and therefore more similar in structure to murine Dectin-1, has also been recently described (17Hermanz-Falcon P. Arce I. Roda-Navarro P. Fernandez-Ruiz E. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Yokota K. Takashima A. Bergstresser P.R. Ariizumi K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We describe here the detailed characterization of the human receptor and show that it is widely expressed, functions as a pattern recognition receptor for Î²-glucans, and can also recognize T-lymphocytes. In contrast to the mouse receptor, we show that the human receptor is alternatively spliced and that splicing appears to be regulated in different cell types. Finally we demonstrate that the various receptor isoforms generated by alternative splicing differ in their ability to recognize Î²-glucans. NIH3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC no. TIB-71) and the HEK293T-based Phoenix ecotropic retroviral packaging cell line (a gift from Gary Nolan, Stanford University) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. All cell lines were obtained from the cell bank of the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology (University of Oxford) except for U937, which was provided by Dr. David Williams (East Tennessee State University). The T-cell lines Jurkat, CEM, Molt-4, and Hut-78 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. All cell lines were grown at 37 Â°C in 5% CO2. All routine nucleic acid manipulation techniques were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Campbell R.D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The human Î²-glucan receptor (hÎ²GR) isoforms were amplified by PCR from human peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA (CLONTECH) and human peripheral blood-derived MÏ cDNA using the following two primers: 5â²-AAAGGATCCAGGGGCTCTCAAGAACAATG-3â² and 5â²-AAACTCGAGTCTTCCACCCTTCCCCTTAC-3â². The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), cloned into the pCR4-TOPO3.1 vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced. Sequencing was performed by the Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford. Sequences were submitted to GenBankTM under the following accession numbers: AF400595 (Î²GRA), AF400596 (Î²GRB), AF400597(Î²GRC), AF400598 (Î²GRD), AF400599 (Î²GRE), AF400600 (Î²GRF),AF400601 (Î²GRG), and AF400602 (Î²GRH). To obtain stable cell lines, the cDNA clones were subcloned into the retroviral vector pFB(neo) (Stratagene) and transfected into Phoenix ecotropic packaging cells using FUGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) transfection reagent following the instructions of the manufacturer. After 48 h, retroviral supernatants were harvested and used to transduce NIH3T3 cells in the presence of 5 Î¼g/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Stable transductants were selected using 0.6 mg/ml geneticin (Sigma). Commercially available membranes containing 2 Î¼g of mRNA from various human tissues were purchased from CLONTECH and used as described by the manufacturer. Membranes containing fractionated peripheral blood leukocyte and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated HL-60 and THP-1 total RNA were a gift from Hsi-Hsien Lin (University of Oxford) and were prepared as described previously (20Stacey M. Lin H.H. Hilyard K.L. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18863-18870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The blots were probed using a radiolabeled full-length hÎ²GRB cDNA probe and washed twice for 20 min in a high stringency solution containing 0.1Ã SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 68 Â°C. The membranes were then exposed to x-ray film (Kodak Biomax MR) at â80 Â°C. For RT-PCR analyses, total RNA from various cell lines was prepared using the guanidine isothiocyanate-based RNA isolation kit (Stratagene). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using an oligo(dT) primer and the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (CLONTECH) as described by the manufacturer. An aliquot of the first strand cDNA was then subjected to PCR using the AdvanTaq kit (CLONTECH) with either glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control primers (CLONTECH) or the hÎ²GR primers described above. Cells at 5 Ã 104/well were plated in a 24-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. Carbohydrates were added at the concentrations indicated in the text and incubated for 20 min, after which either fluorescein-labeled zymosan A (Molecular Probes) (50 particles/cell), rhodamine green-X-labeled (Molecular Probes) heat-killed S. cerevisiae (CLONTECH AH109) (50 particles/cell), or C. albicans (ATCC no. 18804) (20 particles/cell) were added. After 1 h of incubation, the cells were thoroughly washed and then lysed in 3% Triton X-100. The relative fluorescence was determined using a FluoroskanII fluorometer (Titertek). Using these experimental conditions, the relative fluorescence gives a linear response (R 2 = 0.98) reflecting the number of fluorescent particles bound by the cells. Carbohydrates for these analyses were obtained from Sigma (laminarin, barley Î²-glucan, mannan, and carboxymethylcellulose), Megazyme (pullulan, galactan, and lichenan), Pharmacia (dextran), Calbiochem (pustulan), and Seikagaku Corp. (laminariheptaose). Glucan phosphate and scleroglucan were a gift from Dr. David Williams (East Tennessee State University) (21Muller A. Rice P.J. Ensley H.E. Coogan P.S. Kalbfleish J.H. Kelley J.L. Love E.J. Portera C.A. Ha T. Browder I.W. Williams D.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3418-3425PubMed Google Scholar). The NIH3T3 transductants expressing hÎ²GRA were plated at 5 Ã 104/well in a 24-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight. T-lymphoid cell lines were grown as described above, washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm EDTA, and fluorescently labeled with 5 Î¼m CFSE (Molecular Probes) as described by the manufacturer. The labeled T-cells were then added to the transductants and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 h. Following the incubation the cells were washed vigorously and lysed in 3% Triton X-100, and the relative fluorescence was determined. We initially identified a human homologue of Dectin-1 that lacked a stalk region, now termed the B isoform, from a search of the GenBankTMDNA sequence data base (accession number AY009090; Ref. 15Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar; Fig.1). A further isoform containing a stalk was cloned by RT-PCR (see below), termed the A isoform, thus having a structure most similar to that of murine Dectin-1 (Fig. 1). Both these isoforms have also been recently identified by others (17Hermanz-Falcon P. Arce I. Roda-Navarro P. Fernandez-Ruiz E. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Yokota K. Takashima A. Bergstresser P.R. Ariizumi K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These receptors possess a single C-terminal C-type lectin-like domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. The CRDs of human and murine Dectin-1 are most similar to those of the natural killer (NK)-like C-type lectin domains (15Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 18Yokota K. Takashima A. Bergstresser P.R. Ariizumi K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), possessing an extra pair of conserved cysteine residues, which are thought to generate a disulfide linkage (22Llera A.S. Viedma F. Sanchez-Madrid F. Tormo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7312-7319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and lacking the residues involved in co-ordinating calcium found in other typical Ca2+-dependent CRDs (23Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). We have termed these receptors the Î²-glucan receptors (Î²GRs) based on the function of the murine homologue and on the data presented below. We examined the cellular and tissue distributions of this receptor by Northern blotting using a full-length Î²GRB cDNA as a probe (Fig.2 a). Two major hÎ²GR mRNA transcripts of â¼4.2 and 2.4 kilobases (kb) were identified. Both transcripts were widely expressed in a variety of immune and nonimmune tissues with highest expression detected in spleen and in peripheral blood leukocytes. Human Î²GR mRNA was not detected in the brain and skeletal muscle. The expression of hÎ²GR in leukocytes was further examined on RNA from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mononuclear cells, monocytes, and lymphocytes obtained through the fractionation of peripheral blood. While both the 4.2- and 2.4-kb Î²GR transcripts were strongly expressed in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, only the lower (2.4-kb) transcript was detected in mononuclear cells, monocytes, MÏ, and faintly in lymphocytes (Fig. 2 b). Furthermore, expression of this transcript increased in cultured MÏ over time. To explore this further, we next examined the expression of hÎ²GR in the monocytic and promyelocytic leukemia cell lines THP-1 and HL-60, respectively, upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced differentiation into MÏ (Fig. 2 c). Consistent with the observations in peripheral blood-derived MÏ, increased expression of the 2.4-kb transcript was observed upon differentiation of both cell lines. Using Me2SO, HL-60 was also induced to acquire a granulocyte-like phenotype (24Collins S.J. Bodner A. Ting R. Gallo R.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 25: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), but no expression of hÎ²GR was detected under these conditions (not shown). The cellular distribution of the Î²GR was further analyzed by RT-PCR on RNA isolated from various cell lines, including B-cells (Daudi and Raji), T-cells (CEM, Molt-4, Hut78, and Jurkat), and a fibroblast (HEK293T) and a monocyte/macrophage (U937) cell line (Fig.2 d). Transcripts of various sizes were detected in all the cell lines tested with higher levels of expression detected in the B-cell lines Raji and Daudi. Similar transcripts were also detected in cDNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytes, and MÏ, consistent with the Northern blot analysis. To determine the nature of the various transcripts observed by Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis, we cloned the products generated by PCR from peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA. Sequence analysis revealed that there were two predominant and six minor transcripts (Fig.3). While one major isoform corresponded to the original Î²GR we had identified, the second major isoform had a structure similar to mouse Dectin-1, possessing a stalk region containing one putative N-linked glycosylation site between the CRD and transmembrane region. This isoform has been described previously (18Yokota K. Takashima A. Bergstresser P.R. Ariizumi K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis using the stalk region as a specific probe demonstrated that this isoform corresponded to the larger 4.2-kb transcript described above (not shown; the A isoform), while the 2.4-kb transcript corresponds to the original isoform (the B isoform). The other minor transcripts consisted of variations of the primary isoforms, some with deletions in the CRD-encoding region (isoforms C and D) and the transmembrane and stalk region (isoforms E and F), while two isoforms (G and H) possessed small insertions. In all the other minor isoforms, except for E, frameshifts would generate premature stop codons and therefore truncated proteins. The RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2 d) also indicated the presence of other isoforms, which are yet to be characterized. To understand the origin of these various isoforms, the genome organization of this gene was examined. Although two contigs, GenBankTM accession numbers NT_024406.02 and NT_024411.3, were identified in the human genome sequence data base, only the former contained all of the coding sequence of this receptor. The human Î²GR has been mapped to chromosome 12p13, placing this gene within the NK gene cluster complex (17Hermanz-Falcon P. Arce I. Roda-Navarro P. Fernandez-Ruiz E.

The Î²GR consisted of six open reading frame-containing exons and five introns, although the precise length of the intron between exons 5 and 6 could not be determined due to incomplete GenBankTM sequence data (Fig. 3). The cytoplasmic tail was encoded mostly by exon 1 and partly by exon 2. The transmembrane region and stalk regions were completed encoded by exons 2 and 3, respectively. The CRD was encoded by three exons (4, 5, and 6), a gene structure typically found in other type II C-type lectin CRDs (26Santis A.G. Lopez-Cabrera M. Hamann J. Strauss M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on this genomic sequence and determination of the splice donor-acceptor sites of the intron-exon boundaries it can be seen that the various isoforms of this receptor have arisen from alternative splicing events (Fig. 3). While most of the isoforms have arisen from miss-splicing and the loss of various exons, isoforms G and H contained additional small exons encoded within introns 2 and 4. Furthermore, as one isoform (B) was observed to predominate in mature MÏ but not in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Fig. 2b), splicing of these transcripts appears to be regulated. We next examined the ability of the human receptor to recognize Î²-glucans. We first tested the capability of NIH3T3 cells expressing the various splice variants to bind zymosan, a Î²-glucan-rich particle (27Di Carlo F.J. Fiore J.V. Science. 1958; 127: 756-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (Fig.4). Both the predominant isoforms, A and B, were capable of binding zymosan as well as mediating the actin-dependent internalization of the zymosan particles (results not shown). Consistent with the lack of residues involved in calcium co-ordination in the CRD (described above), zymosan binding was independent of metal ions (results not shown). In contrast, none of the other splice variants were able to bind these glucan-rich particles. To determine the substrate specificity of Î²GRA and Î²GRB, the ability of various carbohydrates to block zymosan binding was examined (Fig. 5). Most carbohydrates containing Î²-1,3- or Î²-1,6-linked glucans were able to inhibit zymosan binding to both isoforms in a concentration-dependent manner. Laminarin and glucan phosphate, a structurally defined immunologically active Î²-glucan (28Williams D.L. McNamee R.B. Jones E.L. Pretus H.A. Ensley H.E. Browder I.W. Di Luzio N.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 219: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), were the two most effective inhibitors tested. The receptors were not inhibited by monosaccharides (not shown) or by carbohydrates possessing different linkages, such as Î²-1,4-linked cellulose or Î±-1,6-linked dextran. We also examined the ability of the human receptor to recognize S. cerevisiae and the fungal pathogen C. albicans, both of which possess Î²-1,3- and Î²-1,6-linked glucans within their cell walls (29Bartnicki-Garcia S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1968; 22: 87-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Intact S. cerevisiae(not shown) and heat-killed C. albicans conidia (Fig.6) were bound by Î²GRA and Î²GRB transductants in a Î²-glucan-dependent fashion. These interactions were not inhibited by mannan, another major cell wall component of these yeasts (29Bartnicki-Garcia S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1968; 22: 87-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). As mouse Dectin-1 had been found to bind to T-lymphocytes in a Î²-glucan-independent fashion, we next examined the ability of hÎ²GRA, the Dectin1-like isoform, to bind T-lymphocytes. Using a whole cell binding assay, a number of T-lymphocyte cell lines were tested for their ability to bind to hÎ²GR transductants. Of the four cell lines tested, Jurkat, Hut-78, Molt-4, and CEM, only CEM was found to reproducibly bind to NIH3T3 transductants expressing hÎ²GR (Fig. 7). In this assay, binding increased with increasing cell numbers and was saturable around 50â70 CEM cells per transductant. Background binding to NIH3T3 cells was also observed to occur but at a significantly lower level. This binding activity was not dependent on lymphoid cell activation by concanavalin A and was not inhibitable by Î²-glucan (Fig. 7). We describe here the characterization of the human Î²-glucan receptor identified following the discovery of the mouse homologue Dectin-1 as a Î²-glucan receptor (15Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Overall the human receptor is both structurally and functionally very similar to the mouse receptor. They are both type II transmembrane proteins possessing a single extracellular C-type lectin-like CRD domain and a cytoplasmic tail containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. These receptors are widely expressed and act as pattern recognition receptors recognizing a variety of Î²-1,3- and/or Î²-1,6-linked glucans. The receptors bind and internalize zymosan and can also recognize intact yeast. In addition, these receptors possess another binding site for T-lymphocytes and thus appear to recognize both endogenous and exogenous ligands. As we have found that both the mouse and human receptors recognize Î²-glucans and are not restricted to dendritic cells (this work and Ref. 15Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), contradicting previous reports (Dectin-1; Refs. 16Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Shikano S. Xu S. Ritter III, R. Kumamoto T. Edelbaum D.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we have renamed the human receptor the human Î²GR. The human and mouse Î²-glucan receptors differ significantly in that the transcript encoding the human receptor is alternatively spliced. Alternative splicing, which has been described for other type II transmembrane lectins (30Ariizumi K. Shen G.L. Shikano S. Ritter III, R. Zukas P. Edelbaum D. Morita A. Takashima A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11957-11963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31Furukawa H. Yabe T. Watanabe K. Miyamoto R. Akaza T. Tadokoro K. Tohma S. Inoue T. Yamamoto K. Juji T. Immunogenetics. 1998; 48: 87-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), results in the production of two predominant functional isoforms as well as a number of minor nonfunctional isoforms. Although the two predominant isoforms are both expressed in multiple tissues they are expressed differently in various cell types (Fig. 2), suggesting that the alternative splicing of these two isoforms can be regulated. While the significance of this is unclear, the presence or absence of a stalk does not seem to have significant effects on the ability of this receptor to recognize Î²-glucans or intact yeast. The other isoforms represent a minor population of the splice variants, and while we have not been able to determine any zymosan binding function for these variants they may serve regulatory roles, a phenomenon described for other cell surface receptors such as CD40 (32Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and scavenger receptor type A (33Gough P.J. Greaves D.R. Gordon S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its ability to recognize glucans, the human Î²GR also recognizes a subset of T-cells. Given the similarity of the CRDs of the Î²-glucan receptors to those of the NK cell-like C-type lectin-like domains (15Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature. 2001; 413: 36-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 18Yokota K. Takashima A. Bergstresser P.R. Ariizumi K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which normally recognize specific major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on target cells (25Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar), it is possible that the ligands on T-cells are major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. The ability of the human Î²GR to recognize only one of the four T-cell lines tested suggests that the ligand is restricted to a subset of T-cells and we are currently exploring this possibility further. While the biological function of this interaction is unknown at present, it poses an intriguing role for this receptor in the recognition of self and nonself ligands. The recognition of major histocompatibility complex class I by the NK CRDs may be also influenced by glycosylation (34Lian R.H. Freeman J.D. Mager D.L. Takei F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2301-2306PubMed Google Scholar), but the role of carbohydrates in these interactions is unclear. The CRDs of these NK receptors lack the residues normally associated with carbohydrate recognition and are thought to be evolutionarily divergent from the classical Ca2+-dependent lectins (23Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Despite this divergence, some NK CRDs have been shown to be able to recognize polysaccharides in both a Ca2+-dependent and -independent fashion (23Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Given the similarity between the NK CRDs and the Î²-glucan receptors, the ability of the Î²-glucan receptor to recognize Î²-1,3- and/or Î²-1,6-linked polysaccharides may not only represent a novel structure-function relationship but may also provide insights into the interaction of the NK CRDs with their ligands. While the NK C-type lectins function in the activation or inhibition of NK cells (25Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar), the immunomodulatory activities of Î²-glucans are thought to stem from their ability to activate leukocytes (7Williams D.L. Mueller A. Browder W. Clin. Immunother. 1996; 5: 392-399Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Czop J.K. Pathol. Immunopathol. Res. 1986; 5: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of Î²-glucans are unknown, cellular responses to zymosan and yeast pathogens have been shown to require at least two receptors: a phagocytic receptor and the signaling Toll-like receptors (35Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C.B. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors sample the phagosome and trigger an inflammatory response, mediated in part through NF-ÎºB activation (35Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Hajjar A.M. Stevens A. Wilson C.B. Bassetti M. Aderem A. Nature. 1999; 401: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to Î²-glucan receptors has been shown to result in NF-ÎºB activation (36Battle J. Ha T. Li C. Della Beffa V. Rice P. Kalbfleisch J. Browder W. Williams D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and it is therefore likely that these receptors, as the phagocytic receptors and Toll-like receptors, as the signaling receptors have important roles in the mediation of cellular responses to Î²-glucans. We are currently examining the role of the Î²GR and the other Î²-glucan receptors in these mechanisms. This will hopefully lead to a better understanding of the effects exerted by Î²-glucans on the immune system and possibly even the development of novel therapeutics. We thank Drs. David Williams, Hsi-Hsien Lin, and Philip Taylor for reagents and advice."

This splitting reflects the energy difference between the bonding and antibonding states formed by the coherent superposition of the Kondo states of each dot. The occurrence of the Kondo resonance and its magnetic field dependence agree with a simple interpretation of the spin status of a double quantum dot."

The recent crystal structure of FcÎ³RIII in complex with IgG-Fc has provided details of molecular interactions between these components (Sondermann, P., Huber, R., Oosthuizen, V., and Jacob, U. (2000) Nature406, 267â273). One of the most intriguing issues is that glycosylation of IgG-Fc is essential for the recognition by FcÎ³Rs although the carbohydrate moieties are on the periphery of the FcÎ³RIII-Fc interface. To better understand the role of Fc glycosylation in FcÎ³R binding we prepared homogeneous glycoforms of IgG-Fc (Cri) and investigated the interactions with a soluble form of FcÎ³RIIb (sFcÎ³RIIb). A 1:1 complex stoichiometry was observed in solution at 30 Â°C (K d, 0.94 Î¼m; ÎG, â8.4 kcal molâ1; ÎH, â6.5 kcal molâ1; TÎS, 1.9 kcal molâ1; ÎC p, â160 cal molâ1 Kâ1). Removal of terminal galactose residues did not alter the thermodynamic parameters significantly. Outer-arm GlcNAc residues contributed significantly to thermal stability of the CH2 domains but only slightly to sFcÎ³RIIb binding. Truncation of 1,3- and 1,6-arm mannose residues generates a linear trisaccharide core structure and resulted in a significantly decreased affinity, a less exothermic ÎH, and a more negative ÎC p for sFcÎ³RIIb binding, which may result from a conformational change coupled to complex formation. Deglycosylation of the CH2 domains abrogated sFcÎ³RIIb binding and resulted in the lowest thermal stability accompanied with noncooperative unfolding. These results suggest that truncation of the oligosaccharides of IgG-Fc causes disorder and a closed disposition of the two CH2 domains, impairing sFcÎ³RIIb binding. Engagement of FcÎ³ receptors (FcÎ³Rs) with the Fc region of IgG elicits immune responses by leukocytes. The recent crystal structure of FcÎ³RIII in complex with IgG-Fc has provided details of molecular interactions between these components (Sondermann, P., Huber, R., Oosthuizen, V., and Jacob, U.

The minimal oligosaccharide structure is a hexasaccharide (GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc) with variable sugar residues attached, which results in the generation of the multiple glycoforms. The oligosaccharide can be traced in x-ray crystal electron density maps of the IgG-Fc and is sequestered within the internal space enclosed by the CH2 domains. There are extensive noncovalent interactions between the carbohydrate and the protein moiety, resulting in reciprocal influences on conformation (6Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 7Padlan E.A. Metzger H. Fc Receptors and the Action of Antibodies. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Recently we have shown that the CH2 domains exhibit a progressive reduction in thermal stability and functionality with successive removal of outer-arm sugar residues (8Mimura Y. Church S.

However, the precise manner in which the oligosaccharide influences or determines Fc structure and functions remains to be determined. Detailed information of the glycosylation influence of IgG-Fc on FcÎ³R binding and complement activation is critical for application of IgG for therapeutic use. FcÎ³Rs are expressed on various hematopoietic cell types (e.g. macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and lymphocytes) and link cellular and humoral immunity by serving as a bridge between antibody specificity and effector cell function. Stimulation of cells through FcÎ³Rs results in a wide variety of effector functions, including Ab-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (9Fanger M.W. Graziano R.F. Shen L. Guyre P.M. Chem. Immunol. 1989; 47: 214-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phagocytosis (10Anderson C.L. Shen L. Eicher D.M. Wewers M.D. Gill J.K. J. Exp.

Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). FcÎ³RI binds monomeric IgG with high affinity. FcÎ³RII and FcÎ³RIII are low affinity IgG receptors and responsible for the clearance of immune complexes. Furthermore, FcÎ³Rs occur in various isoforms (FcÎ³RIa, -b1, -b2, -c; FcÎ³RIIa1â2, -b1â3, -c) and alleles (FcÎ³RIIa1-HR, -LR; FcÎ³RIIIb-NA1, NA2) (14van de Winkel J.G.J. Capel P.J.A. Immunol.

Jacob U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting conflicting models for the formation of IgG-FcÂ·FcÎ³R complexes. Direct evidence has now been provided from the crystal complex of human IgG1-Fc with recombinant human FcÎ³RIII (20Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and NMR studies of the interaction of mouse IgG2b-Fc with mouse FcÎ³RII (21Kato K. Sautes-Fridman C. Yamada W. Kobayashi K.

Biol. 2000; 295: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), demonstrating a 1:1 stoichiometry as the consistent requirement for the expression of Fc effector functions without triggering permanent activation through a single IgG molecule. To better understand how the oligosaccharide contributes to the expression of the IgG-Fc effector function, we investigated the interaction between a recombinant soluble form of FcÎ³RIIb (sFcÎ³RIIb) and homogeneous Fc glycoforms using isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance. A 1:1 stoichiometry for the interaction of sFcÎ³RIIb with Fc in solution is demonstrated although the binding of two sFcÎ³RIIb molecules to one IgG molecule has been proposed by a modeling approach (19Sondermann P. Huber R. Jacob U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We extend this finding to examine the thermodynamic analysis of defined glycoforms of IgG-Fc on sFcÎ³RIIb binding and show that the mannose residues exert an important influence on sFcÎ³RIIb binding. Finally, we discuss how the oligosaccharide residues of IgG-Fc affect FcÎ³R binding. Recombinant soluble human FcÎ³RIIb was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified, as described previously (22Sondermann P. Jacob U. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the extracellular region of hFcÎ³RIIb2 (23Engelhardt W. Geerds C. Frey J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was overexpressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli which were purified by lysozyme treatment of the cells and subsequent sonication. The resulting suspension was centrifuged (30 min, 30,000 Ã g) and washed with buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) lauryldimethylamine oxide. The centrifugation step and resuspension in lauryldimethylamine oxide-containing buffer was repeated twice, and then twice more without lauryldimethylamine oxide. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and the protein renatured. The dialyzed and filtered protein solution was applied to a human IgG-Sepharose column and eluted by pH jump. The concentrated neutralized fractions were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using a calculated Îµ280 of 29,400 mâ1 cmâ1 (24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). The monoclonal protein IgG1 (Cri, allotype G1m(f)) was isolated from serum from a patient with multiple myeloma and the IgG1-Fc fragment generated as previously reported (25Jefferis R. Lund J. Mizutani H. Nakagawa H. Kawazoe Y. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The following protocols were used to generate truncated glycoforms of IgG1-Fc (Cri). For (NGA2F)2glycoform, the native IgG1-Fc (5 mg) in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, was exposed to sialidase (0.5 unit; Arthrobacter ureafaciens, Roche Molecular Diagnostics, East Sussex, UK) at 37 Â°C for 24 h. The pH was adjusted to 6.0 and Î²-galactosidase (0.2 unit; Diplococcus pneumoniae, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) added and the solution incubated at 37 Â°C for 24 h. For the (M3N2F)2 glycoform, (NGA2F)2 IgG1-Fc (5 mg), in 50 mm citric acid, Na2HPO4, pH 4.8, was exposed toN-acetyl-Î²-d-glucosaminidase (0.225 unit,D. pneumoniae, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 Â°C for 24 h. The (MN2F)2 glycoform, (M3N2F)2IgG1-Fc (5 mg) in 50 mm acetate buffer containing zinc acetate (2 mm), pH 5.0, was exposed to Î±-mannosidase (15 units, Jack bean, Glyko, Oxfordshire, UK) at 37 Â°C for 48 h. For deglycosylated IgG1-Fc the native IgG1-Fc (5 mg) in 40 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, was exposed to peptide-N-glycosidase F (30 units;Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 Â°C for 72 h. Following exposure to glycosidases all proteins were affinity purified using a Streptococcal protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.7. Eluates were immediately neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, and dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline. The IgG1 or IgG1-Fc (Cri) was reduced and alkylated according to Fleischman et al. (26Fleischman J.B. Porter R.R. Press E.M. Biochem. J. 1963; 88: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, IgG1 or IgG1-Fc (Cri, 10 mg/ml) was dissolved in 0.5 m Tris/HCl containing 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The protein was treated with 0.01m dithiothreitol at room temperature for 1 h after being sparged with N2 gas. Iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 0.02 m and incubated on ice for 30 min with gentle stirring. The protein was dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline. Cleavage of the interchain disulfide bonds was confirmed by nonreduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Alkylation of Cys residues involved in inter-chain disulfide bridges (L chain, 1; H chain, 3) was confirmed by an increase in their masses by 59 and 178 Da, respectively, relative to those of reduced L and H chain (data not shown), which corresponds well to the mass of the -CH2-CONH2 group (58 Da) added by alkylation. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed using an LCTTM instrument and MassLynx data acquisition (Micromass, Manchester, UK). This instrument is an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer, with a Z-spray electrospray ion source. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive-ion mode. Resolution of the mass spectrometer was 5000 atm/z 1500. The cone voltage was set to 35 V. The purified IgG1-Fc Cri proteins (1 mg/ml) were extensively dialyzed against distilled water and formic acid added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Ten microliters of the sample solution was injected via a Rheodyne valve into the mobile phase of 50% acetonitrile, and 50% of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water. Ten to twenty spectra were averaged, baseline subtracted, and deconvoluted using MAX.ENT. software (Micromass). ITC was performed at 30.0 Â°C using the MCS-ITC system (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). To examine the stoichiometry of the interaction between IgG-Fc and sFcÎ³RIIb, one of the proteins was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to 10â13 Î¼m and placed in the calorimeter cell (1.34 ml). The injection syringe (250 Î¼l) was filled with a concentrated solution (0.30â0.37 mm) of the other component dissolved in the same buffer. sFcÎ³RIIb from the syringe was titrated into the calorimeter cell containing the homogeneous glycoform of IgG-Fc. A series of injections was made, and the observed heat pulses integrated and fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software Origin 2.9 (MicroCal) with ÎH (the enthalpy change in cal molâ1), K a (the equilibrium association constant in mâ1), and n (the number of binding sites per monomer) as adjustable parameters. The quantity c values (27Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar) were between 5 and 20 in the present study. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated from basic equations of thermodynamics: ÎG = ÎH âTÎS = âRTlnK a, where ÎG, ÎH, and ÎS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding, respectively. T is the temperature in K, andR = 1.98 cal molâ1 Kâ1. The change in heat capacity of binding (ÎC p), which is assumed to be independent of temperature, was determined using the following expression: ÎC p = (ÎH T2 â ÎH T1)/(T 2 âT 1). Experiments were performed on a VP-DSC microcalorimeter (MicroCal) with IgG1-Fc sample concentrations of 4 Î¼m and a scan rate of 60 Â°C hâ1. No concentration dependence of the thermal unfolding temperatures (T m) and calorimetric enthalpies (ÎH) was observed at this low concentration. Data were collected and analyzed using Origin 4.1 software (MicroCal), essentially as previously described (28Ghirlando R. Lund J. Goodall M. Jefferis R. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The area below each transition peak corresponds to ÎH, and the van't Hoff enthalpy (ÎHv) was calculated using the formula: ÎHv = 4RT m2<ÎC p >tr,max/ÎH, where <ÎC p >tr,max is the measured heat capacity at the peak maximum, and R is the gas constant. The cooperativity of the heat transition was calculated as the ratio ÎH/ÎHv (29Sturtevant J.M. Ann. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1987; 38: 463-488Crossref Google Scholar). sFcÎ³RIIb binding was measured using BIAcore 3000 and CM5 biosensor chips (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Homogeneous glycoforms of IgG-Fc were immobilized onto the chips by amide coupling following the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were performed with sFcÎ³RIIb in a mobile phase at flow rate of 10 Î¼l/min using 20 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4. The carbodiimide/ethanolamine-treated blank was included as a control. K d values for the binding of the Fc glycoforms to sFcÎ³RIIb were estimated from the plots of the steady-state binding levels against sFcÎ³RIIb concentrations fitted to a single binding site model using the formula:R eq =R max*c/(K d +c), where R eq is the level of binding at equilibrium, and R max is the theoretical binding capacity, and c is the concentration of sFcÎ³RIIb. Curve fitting was performed with Origin 5.0 (MicroCal). Experimental ÎG T values were fitted using Origin 5.0 to nonlinear van't Hoff equation with a reference temperatureT o of 303.15 K to obtain ÎH To, ÎS To, ÎC p, assuming that the change in heat capacity for the association, ÎC p is a temperature-independent variable (30Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar): ÎG T = ÎH To âTÎS To + (T âT o)ÎC p âTÎC p ln(T/T o). To determine the independent thermodynamic parameters (K d and ÎH) as well as the number of binding sites (n) governing IgG-sFcÎ³RIIb interaction, ITC was carried out at 30 Â°C (Fig. 1). The thermodynamic characteristics for this interaction was enthalpy- and entropy-driven (Table I), which is markedly different from IgG-sFcÎ³RIII interaction where a large unfavorable entropy is compensated by a larger favorable enthalpy at 30 Â°C (31Ghirlando R. Keown M.B. Mackay G.A. Lewis M.S. Unkeless J.C. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13320-13327Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Maenaka, K., van der Merwe, P. A., Stuart, D. I., Jones, E. Y., and Sondermann, P. (September 5, 2001)J. Biol. Chem. DOI 10.1074/jbc.M106812200Google Scholar). Essentially the same thermodynamic parameters were obtained irrespective of whether IgG-Fc was titrated into sFcÎ³RIIb (Fig. 1 A) or sFcÎ³RIIb into IgG1-Fc (Fig. 1 B) (Table I). Both binding isotherms were best fitted to a 1:1 association model. If the stoichiometry were different from 1:1, the values of ÎH and n would differ depending on which component is in the calorimeter cell and which is being titrated as shown for the interaction between IgG and neonatal FcR (33Huber A.H. Kelley R.F. Gastinel L.N. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the results verify that the stoichiometry for the interaction is 1:1 in solution, suggesting that sFcÎ³RIIb binds to the hinge-proximal region of the CH2 domains of Fc in a manner similar to that observed for the structure of Fc in complex with sFcÎ³RIII (20Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic parameters for sFcÎ³RIIb binding to intact IgG molecules were almost the same as those for IgG-Fc (Table I), indicating that the Fab regions of IgG do not contribute significantly to binding of FcÎ³RIIb. We disrupted the hinge inter-chain disulfide bridges of IgG by mild reduction and alkylation to examine its effect on the stoichiometry of the interaction. The stoichiometry for sFcÎ³RIIb interaction with reduced and alkylated IgG remained the same as that for sFcÎ³RIIb-intact IgG interaction (1:1) although the affinity was reduced by a factor of two (Table I). Thus the stoichiometry of binding is unaffected by the integrity of the hinge disulfide bridges of IgG.Table IThermodynamics of the interaction between IgG (Cri) and sFcÎ³RIIb by ITC at 30 Â°CTitrationn(Stoichiometry)K dÎGÎHTÎSÎ¼mkcal/molIgG1-Fc â sFcÎ³RIIb1.00 Â± 0.040.98 Â± 0.01â8.30 Â± 0.01â6.20 Â± 0.202.10 Â± 0.20sFcÎ³RIIb â IgG1-Fc0.91 Â± 0.010.94 Â± 0.06â8.35 Â± 0.04â6.49 Â± 0.271.86 Â± 0.31sFcÎ³RIIb â intact IgG10.97 Â± 0.040.95 Â± 0.02â8.35 Â± 0.01â6.35 Â± 0.272.00 Â± 0.28sFcÎ³RIIb â R/A IgG11-aReduced and alkylated IgG.1.06 Â± 0.021.89 Â± 0.40â7.93 Â± 0.13â3.80 Â± 0.064.12 Â± 0.13The data are the mean values of the two independent experiments with an S.E.1-a Reduced and alkylated IgG.

To dissect the roles of Fc oligosaccharide residues in sFcÎ³RIIb binding, exoglycosidases were used to prepare Fc glycoforms bearing truncated oligosaccharides. The purity and glycosylation homogeneity of the glycoforms of IgG1-Fc (Cri) were tested by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Fig.2). The observed mass of deglycosylated Fc (49,923 Da) was in good agreement with the theoretical mass of the Fc fragment (49,931 Da; calculated for the G1m(f) allotype) lacking the C-terminal lysine, and having Asp at Asn-297. The mass spectra of native Fc showed heterogeneity in terms of glycosylation as reported by Jefferis et al. (25Jefferis R. Lund J. Mizutani H. Nakagawa H. Kawazoe Y. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Experimental masses of the truncated glycoforms were in good agreement with the calculated mass values within an error of 0.03% (TableII).Table IIDetermination of the glycoforms of IgG1-Fc (Cri) by Electrospray ionization mass spectrometryGlycoformMolecular mass (Da)ObservedCalculatedDeglycosylated49,92349,931(MN2F)251,34751,358(M3N2F)251,99352,007(NGA2F)252,81152,820NGA2F + NA1F2-aNA1F, fucosylated and monogalactosylated glycoform.52,97252,982NGA2F + NA2F/(NA1F)22-bNA2F, fucosylated and digalactosylated glycoform.53,13553,144NA1F + NA2F53,29353,306Monosialyl NA1F + NA2F53,59053,5982-a NA1F, fucosylated and monogalactosylated glycoform.2-b NA2F, fucosylated and digalactosylated glycoform. Open table in a new tab The interactions between sFcÎ³RIIb and homogeneous glycoforms of IgG-Fc (Cri) were investigated by ITC (Fig. 3). The thermodynamic parameters were characterized at 30 Â°C (TableIII). The native Fc and its nongalactosylated glycoform, (NGA2F)2, showed very similar thermodynamic parameters (Fig. 3, a and b; TableIII). Removal of terminal GlcNAc residues to generate the (M3N2F)2 glycoform resulted in only a slight decrease in binding affinity without a significant change in enthalpy, indicating a less favorable entropic contribution (Fig. 3 c, Table III). However, trimming of the terminal mannose residues generated the (MN2F)2 glycoform that showed a marked reduction in binding affinity and enthalpy without a significant change in entropy (Fig.3 d, Table III). Interaction of deglycosylated Fc with sFcÎ³RIIb was not detectable (Fig. 3 e). Mock-digested Fc showed essentially the same thermodynamics for sFcÎ³RIIb binding as the native Fc (data not shown).Table IIIThermodynamic parameters for the interactions between sFcÎ³RIIb and homogeneous glycoforms of IgG1-Fc by ITC at 30 Â°CGlycoformStoichiometryK dÎGÎHTÎSÎC pNative0.91 Â± 0.010.94 Â± 0.06â8.35 Â± 0.04â6.49 Â± 0.271.86 Â± 0.31â160 Â± 103-aThe errors represent the estimated standard error obtained from the data fitting.(NGA2F)20.93 Â± 0.010.99 Â± 0.01â8.33 Â± 0.01â6.47 Â± 0.061.85 Â± 0.06ND3-bND, not determined.(M3N2F)20.96 Â± 0.071.19 Â± 0.04â8.21 Â± 0.02â6.58 Â± 0.211.63 Â± 0.14ND3-bND, not determined.(MN2F)20.90 Â± 0.023.03 Â± 0.55â7.63 Â± 0.12â5.89 Â± 0.151.74 Â± 0.27â250 Â± 403-aThe errors represent the estimated standard error obtained from the data fitting.The parameters were calculated from the binding isotherms in Fig. 3.K d is given in units of Î¼m, ÎG, ÎH, and TÎS are given in kcal/mol, and ÎC p is given in cal/mol/K. sFcÎ³RIIb was injected into the calorimeter cell containing various IgG-Fc glycoforms.

The parameters except ÎC p are the mean values of the two independent experiments with an S.E. Surface plasmon resonance was employed for thermodynamic analysis of the interactions of sFcÎ³RIIb with homogeneous glycoforms of Fc immobilized on sensor chips at six different temperatures 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 Â°C. A representative binding profile is shown at 25 Â°C in Fig. 4 A. Although the dissociation constants obtained by surface plasmon resonance were generally greater by about 3-fold (TableIV), relative to those obtained by ITC (Table III), both data sets show the same trends in that trimming of terminal GlcNAc and mannose residues of the oligosaccharide chains of IgG-Fc results in a slight and marked decrease in affinity, respectively (Fig. 4 B). In addition, it was shown that the binding affinity to sFcÎ³RIIb was decreased with increasing the temperature for all glycoforms (Fig. 4 B). The plots of ÎG values against temperature were fitted to a nonlinear van't Hoff equation (Fig. 4 C). Apparently, the thermodynamics were almost the same between native Fc and the (NGA2F)2 glycoform because their plots overlapped closely (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, ÎC p of the (M3N2F)2 glycoform was similar to those of native Fc and the (NGA2F)2 glycoform, however, the value for the (MN2F)2 glycoform was more negative (Table IV).Table IVThermodynamic parameters determined by surface plasmon resonance at 30 Â°CGlycoformK dÎGÎHTÎSÎC pT s 4-aThe temperature at which entropy contribution becomes zero.

As such, several transcription factors have been demonstrated to activate expression of bcl-2, including NF-ÎºB.

This translocation moves the bcl-2 open reading frame from its normal promoter and regulatory sequences on chromosome 18 and places it under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (EÎ¼) on chromosome 14, leading to aberrant expression (1Strasser A. Wang D.C.S. Vaux D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 151-178PubMed Google Scholar). Since its identification, Bcl-2 has become the archetypal member of a related family of proteins involved in the regulation of apoptotic cell death, with its overexpression leading to prolonged survival of lymphocyte and promyeloid cells that ordinarily respond to a variety of apoptotic signals (1Strasser A.

However, not all cell types displaying Bcl-2 overexpression harbor the t(14;18) translocation. Some cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia are characterized by variant translocations of the bcl-2 gene including t(2;18) and t(22;18), which place bcl-2 into the gene loci of the immunoglobulin Îº or Î» light chains, respectively (1Strasser A.

Other transcription factors may also be important in the expression ofbcl-2 including the NF-ÎºB family, which has been implicated in the expression of both bcl-2 andbcl-XL in primary hippocampal neurons (9Tamatani M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and also in the maturation of B-cells, where peripheral B-cells are prevented from undergoing apoptosis by NF-ÎºB-mediated Bcl-2 up-regulation (55Grossmann M.

Thus, depending on the cell type and possibly the stage of differentiation, various transcription factors may regulate expression of the bcl-2 gene. Of the transcription factors mentioned, NF-ÎºB in particular has become especially interesting because it has been implicated in the control of several Bcl-2 family members including A1, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2 itself (9Tamatani M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6351-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). NF-ÎºB was first described by Sen and Baltimore (13Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar) as a B-cell factor that binds to a site in the enhancer region of the gene encoding the immunoglobulin Îº light chain. NF-ÎºB has since been shown to activate transcription of numerous genes involved in inflammation and immunity such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-2,1 IL-6, and IL-8 (14Schreck R. Albermann K. Bauerle P.A. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). The NF-ÎºB family of transcription factors comprises a set of proteins that share what is referred to as a Rel homology domain, including mammalian p50 (NF-ÎºB1), p65 (RelA), p52, c-Rel, and Rel-B. NF-ÎºB is usually described as a dimer composed of the p50 and p65 subunits and is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm in complex with the specific inhibitors IÎºBÎ± or IÎºBÎ². Upon stimulation by certain cytokines such as TNFÎ± and IL-1 or by stress factors including double-stranded RNA, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, phorbol esters, UV light, Î³-radiation, protein synthesis inhibitors, and/or viruses, NF-ÎºB is translocated to the nucleus where it then associates with the DNA-binding motif 5â²-GGGACTTTCC-3â² (consensus 5â²-GGGRNNYYCC-3â²) (15Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 12: 649-681Crossref Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). It is thought that nuclear localization is exclusively achieved by first releasing NF-ÎºB from its cytoplasmic complex with IÎºB (16Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar,17Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The release, initiated by the phosphorylation of IÎºBÎ± on serines 32 and 36, is followed by degradation of the inhibitor via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (18Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 19Bauerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). This overall process is controlled by an auto-feedback loop in which NF-ÎºB regulates the expression of IÎºBÎ± (17Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A nuclear form of NF-ÎºB is constitutive in various cell types, including B-cell lymphomas, and this constitutive activation may arise via a mechanism distinct from that of the classical transient pathway described above. In one such mechanism, hypophosphorylated IÎºBÎ² acts as a chaperone, protecting NF-ÎºB from being bound and inhibited by IÎºBÎ±, and draws NF-ÎºB into the nucleus (20Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 21Philips R.J. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Suyang H. Philips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, constitutive activation of NF-ÎºB through an IÎºB chaperone may not be unique to IÎºBÎ². Bcl-3, a homologue of the IÎºB proteins, has been shown to react with the cytoplasmic pool of p50 complexed with its precursor, p105, thereby forming p50 homodimers that translocate to the nucleus in a p50/p50/Bcl-3 complex (23Watanabe N. Iwamura T. Shinoda T. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is evident that different routes to NF-ÎºB activation, as well as different dimer forms of NF-ÎºB, may provide distinct mechanisms for differential control of various genes containing ÎºB binding sites within their promoter regions, including anti-apoptotic proteins such as inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (24Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar) and members of the Bcl-2 family. We have investigated the role of a constitutively nuclear form of NF-ÎºB that arises during the progression of an apoptosis-sensitive murine B-cell lymphoma cell line displaying little Bcl-2 protein expression (LY-as) to an apoptosis-resistant line with a 30-fold increase in Bcl-2 (LY-ar) (27Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Malone C.G. Hobbs M.L. Meyn R.E Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mirkovic N. Voehringer D.W. Story M.D. McConkey D.J. McDonnel T.J. Meyn R.E. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). By use of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and NF-ÎºB family member-specific antibodies, we provide evidence that p50 homodimers make up the activated nuclear NF-ÎºB complex in LY-ar cells. We demonstrate that reversing the activity of this NF-ÎºB dimer form leads to a decrease in bcl-2 transcripts in the LY-ar cell type. Additionally, EMSA using oligonucleotides representing putative NF-ÎºB sites revealed that several sites within the bcl-2P1 promoter/5â²-flanking region are capable of interacting with p50. Lastly we demonstrate, through in vitro transcription, that p50 is capable of enhancing transcription from the bcl-2 P1 promoter. We conclude that p50 homodimers are capable of enhancing transcription and that bcl-2 is likely a target gene for this NF-ÎºB dimer form. LY-ar and LY-as murine B-cell lymphoma cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) 200 mml-glutamine, and 1% (v/v) 10,000 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C. In some experiments, TPA (Sigma) was added to the culture medium in 100% ethanol at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml and allowed to remain in the culture medium for the times indicated. Experiments in which calpain inhibitor I (Sigma) was used were performed with a final concentration of 5 Î¼m calpain inhibitor I in dimethyl sulfoxide, which was allowed to remain in the culture medium for 12 h. Experiments in which TNFÎ± was used were performed for the indicated times in the presence of 30 ng/ml recombinant murine TNFÎ± (Sigma). Experiments were performed on cells seeded at 3 Ã 105/ml. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (25Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar), and 15 Î¼g of nuclear protein was incubated with 32P-labeled NF-ÎºB oligonucleotide as described by the manufacturer (Promega) except 0.07 pmol of radiolabeled consensus oligonucleotide probe/reaction was used rather than 0.035 pmol. In supershift experiments, 2 Î¼g of antibody specific for NF-ÎºB family members p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB (Santa Cruz) was added to the reaction mix after DNA binding for an additional 30 min at 4 Â°C. Experiments in which recombinant human p50 was used were performed with 1.2 gel shift units (115 ng of total protein) of p50 (Promega), 36.4 Î¼g of HeLaScribe Nuclear Extract (Promega), and 1 ng of bcl-2 promoter-specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotides. Bound probe was resolved from free probe using 4% native gels run at 180 V at 4 Â°C for â¼2.5 h. The gels were visualized by phosphorimaging. Whole cell lysates were prepared in SDS-containing lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min. 20 Î¼g of protein/lane was loaded on 5% stacking/10% resolving polyacrylamide gels and run for â¼1 h at 18 mA. Protein bands were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 100 V for 1 h at 4 Â°C. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 and probed with hamster anti-mouse Bcl-2 (Pharmingen) or anti-actin (Chemicon) overnight. The membranes were then washed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 to remove excess primary antibody and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Syrian hamster (Jackson Laboratories) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for roughly 1 h. The blots were developed with ECL+ and visualized by fluorescence scanning and ImagequantTMsoftware. Bcl-2 primary antibody dilution was 1:2000, and secondary antibody dilution was 1:3000. Actin primary antibody dilution was 1:5000, and secondary antibody dilution was 1:2000. RNase protection assay was performed on 10 Î¼g of RNA prepared with RNAzol B (Tel-Test) using the Riboquant mAPO-2 multi-probe template set as described by the manufacturer (Pharmingen). The gels were visualized by phosphorimaging. A three-step cloning strategy based on previous studies was used to create thebcl-2 promoter construct (50Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 308-bp product was polymerase chain reaction-amplified with primer-generatedXhoI and HindIII sites from a 7.8-kilobase genomic HindIII fragment of the bcl-2 gene. This 308-bp product covers a region just 5â² to the AccI site to just 5â² of the initiation codon. This product was cloned into theXhoI and HindIII sites of the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Promega), producing pGL3-308 Bcl-2. Next, a 486-bpXhoI/AccI restriction fragment was cloned into pGL3-308 Bcl-2, producing pGL3-748 Bcl-2. Finally, a 2100-bpXhoI fragment was cloned into pGL3-748 Bcl-2, producing pGL3-2.8 Bcl-2. The sequence contained within the construct is available as GenBankTM accession numbers X51898 andM13994. Additionally, truncated bcl-2 promoter constructs were generated from pGL3-2.8 Bcl-2 and cloned into the G-less cassette-containing construct, pMLC2AT1GÎ50, generously provided by Dr. Michele Sawadogo. Three constructs containing bcl-2 promoter elements were made. All constructs were made by restriction digestion of pGL3-2.8 Bcl-2 to generate fragments that were then blunt-ended (by fill-in reaction with T4 DNA polymerase) and cloned into a blunt-ended BamHI site within the pMLC2AT1GÎ50 cloning region. Fragments cloned included a 1322-bp fragment generated by digestion with XhoI and AgeI, an 800-bp fragment generated by digestion withAvrII and AgeI, and a 727-bp fragment generated by digestion with HphI and AgeI. All constructs were checked for proper orientation upstream of the G-less cassette. In vitro transcription reactions were performed similarly to the one described by Dignamet al. (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and the in vitro transcription system protocol provided by the manufacturer (Promega). Briefly, 25-Î¼l reaction mixtures were prepared by combining HeLaScribeÂ® nuclear extract (58.2 Î¼g/reaction) with ATP, UTP, CTP (provided at 0.6 mm), and GTP (provided at 0.024 mm) in a buffer solution containing 6 mm MgCl2. [Î±-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) was used to label run-off transcripts. The reactions were performed in the presence of 115 ng of recombinant human p50 (Promega) or BSA, and 500 ng of linearized human bcl-2 P1 promoter/5â²-flanking region was used as a template. The reactions were initiated by addition of HeLa extract and performed at 27 Â°C for 60 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 175 Î¼l of stop solution containing 0.3m Tris-HCl, pH 7.40, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and 3 Î¼g/ml yeast tRNA. RNA was isolated with phenol and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) extractions. RNA was precipitated with 100% ethanol, pelleted, dried, and resuspended in nuclease-free water. The samples were heated to 90 Â°C prior to loading onto gels. RNA was resolved on a 6% acrylamide, 7m urea denaturing gel run at 300 V. Gels were dried, and run-off transcripts were visualized by phosphorimaging and quantified with ImagequantTM software. In vitro transcription reactions using G-less cassette, whole plasmid constructs as a template were performed in a similar manner. Changes to the protocol included the following: 1) 43.7 Î¼g of HeLaScribeÂ® nuclear extract was used per reaction; 2) GTP was omitted from the reaction, and CTP was provided at 0.024 mm; 3) MgCl2 was provided at 7 mm. 4) [Î±-32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) was used to label G-less cassette transcripts; 4) 0.1 mm3â²-O-methyl GTP and 25 units of RNase T1 were included; and 5) the reactions were performed at 30 Â°C. In one set of reactions, 4 Î¼g of antibodies to p50 or RelB were also included in the reaction (Santa Cruz). Two murine B-cell lymphoma cell lines, isolated from a mouse lymphoma (LY-TH) and grown in vitro, were used in these studies. The line designated LY-as is sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis, and the line designated LY-ar was derived from a population of the sensitive cells after maintenance in culture on the basis of its resistance to apoptosis (27Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Malone C.G. Hobbs M.L. Meyn R.E Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar). The resistant cell line was previously shown to have 30 times the amount of Bcl-2 protein expression as the sensitive cell line (28Mirkovic N. Voehringer D.W. Story M.D. McConkey D.J. McDonnel T.J. Meyn R.E. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which apparently accounts for the difference in propensity for apoptotic cell death. A representative Bcl-2 Western blot is provided (Fig. 1 A). We were unable to demonstrate by Southern blot evidence for a translocation event underlying the overexpression of Bcl-2 in the LY-ar cell population (data not shown). This, along with the finding that resistant cells emerge from the sensitive cell population in a reproducible manner with high frequency, suggests that Bcl-2 expression is altered at the level of transcription regulation. Because of previous studies implicating NF-ÎºB as a factor involved in B-cell lymphoma development and Bcl-2 family member expression, we compared NF-ÎºB activity in nuclear extracts from LY-as and LY-ar cells. EMSA revealed that LY-ar cells have a constitutive form of NF-ÎºB DNA binding, whereas LY-as cells do not (Fig. 1 B). To determine what members of the NF-ÎºB family make up the constitutive form of NF-ÎºB in LY-ar cells, EMSA supershift experiments were performed in which antibodies to known NF-ÎºB family members were added to the DNA binding reaction. The only reactive antibody was anti-p50, which efficiently shifted the DNA-binding complex, indicating that the constitutive form of NF-ÎºB found in LY-ar cells is most likely composed of p50 homodimers (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the increase in Bcl-2 expression found between LY-as and LY-ar cells correlated with constitutive activation of p50 homodimers. In an attempt to modulate p50 homodimer activity, we incubated LY-ar cells in the presence of calpain inhibitor I, a proteasome inhibitor shown to reverse NF-ÎºB activity (18Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 47Claudio E. Segade F. Wrobel K. Ramos S. Bravo R. Lazo P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). EMSA revealed that treatment with 5 Î¼m calpain inhibitor I for 12 h led to reversal of p50 homodimer DNA binding in LY-ar nuclear extracts (Fig.2 A). To determine whether reversing nuclear p50 homodimer activity had an effect on the amount ofbcl-2 transcript, RNase protection assay was performed on calpain inhibitor I-treated LY-ar cells. Detectable bcl-2transcripts were diminished in LY-ar cells following treatment with calpain inhibitor I (Fig. 2 B). The correlation of loss of nuclear p50 activity with a decrease in bcl-2 expression is consistent with a role for p50 homodimers in the regulation ofbcl-2 transcription. Because TPA and TNFÎ± activate NF-ÎºB (15Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 12: 649-681Crossref Scopus (5592) Google Scholar), we treated LY-as cells with these agents, and nuclear NF-ÎºB activity and Bcl-2 protein expression were measured. TNFÎ± induced only a single complex, which we deemed to be classical NF-ÎºB composed of p50 and p65 subunits (Fig.3 A). As a control, LY-ar cells were also treated with TNFÎ±. As expected, the complex that TNFÎ± activated migrated more slowly than did p50/p50 in the LY-ar cell type (Fig. 3 B), suggesting than TNFÎ± activated classical NF-ÎºB in this cell system. As a final measure to demonstrate that TNFÎ± activated an NF-ÎºB complex distinct from p50/p50, EMSA in the presence of anti-p65 antibody was performed. TNFÎ± activated a complex that was reactive to anti-p65 antibody as demonstrated by a decrease in the NF-ÎºB-specific shift as well as the detection of a weak supershifted complex (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, TPA induced both p50/p50 and p50/p65 complexes (Fig. 3 D). Interestingly, Bcl-2 Western blot revealed that whereas TNFÎ± did not induce Bcl-2 protein expression, TPA did in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3 E). Similar results were also obtained by treatment with spermine, which activated only the slower migrating classical form of NF-ÎºB but did not induce Bcl-2 protein expression (data not shown). Again, these data were consistent with a role for p50 homodimers in the regulation of Bcl-2 transcription. To investigate whether the bcl-2 promoter region contained sequences capable of interacting with p50, we scanned the bcl-2 promoter/5â²-flanking region for putative NF-ÎºB sites by use of the Transfac (29Heinemeyer T. Chen X. Karas H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Liebich I. Meinhardt T. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 54Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) and Lalign (57Huang X. Miller W. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 373-381Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar) programs. Sequences within the P1 promoter region deemed to be putative ÎºB sites were then prepared as radiolabeled oligonucleotides, and EMSA was performed with recombinant p50 in HeLa nuclear extracts. A schematic of the bcl-2 promoter region with putative NF-ÎºB sites tested is provided (Fig. 4 A). All oligonucleotides led to a p50-specific shift, with oligonucleotides 3, 4, and 7 creating the strongest shifts (Fig. 4 B). These data demonstrate that the bcl-2 promoter region contains sites capable of interacting with p50. To assess whether p50 was capable of mediating transcription of the bcl-2 gene, an in vitrotranscription assay using the human bcl-2 P1 promoter was performed. Representations of the bcl-2 promoter construct and linearized construct used as a template in the transcription assay are provided (Fig. 4 A). The addition of recombinant human p50 to HeLa nuclear extracts led to a roughly 6-fold increase in run-off transcripts corresponding in size to that predicted based on initiation sites (48Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennett S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) for the bcl-2 gene (Fig.4 C). Because the addition of p50 alone led to enhanced transcription, these data indicate that p50 is indeed capable of acting as a transcriptional activator and suggest that bcl-2 is a target gene for its activity. We sought to delineate the regions within the bcl-2 promoter through which p50 enhanced transcription. To do this, we cloned portions of the bcl-2promoter upstream of the P1 start site into the G-less cassette containing construct, pMLC2AT1GÎ50, which also contains the last 50 nucleotides of the adenovirus major late promoter to provide an initiation site for transcription. Truncatedbcl-2 5â²-flanking regions were cloned into the minimal promoter construct, and in vitro transcription reactions were performed. Representations of the truncated constructs used are provided (Fig. 5 A). Addition of recombinant human p50 to HeLa nuclear extracts led to enhanced transcription of the G-less cassette for both theXhoI/AgeI and AvrII/AgeI constructs, with roughly 8- and 3-fold increases, respectively. However, addition of p50 led to little or no increase in transcription from the HphI/AgeI construct. To demonstrate that the effect was specific to p50, antibodies were added to the transcription reaction. Upon addition of anti-p50 antibody, but not antibody to RelB, transcription of the G-less cassette was diminished (Fig. 5 B). These data demonstrate specific enhancement of transcription by p50 using regions of the bcl-2 promoter known to have sequences with which p50 can interact, primarily implicating NF-ÎºB sites as being important to transcription ofbcl-2 by p50. In the present study we investigated the activation of p50/p50 homodimers in a murine B-cell lymphoma. We provided correlative evidence that p50/p50 is important to Bcl-2 expression in the LY-ar cell type and provided additional evidence that p50 can bind regions within the bcl-2 promoter/5â²-flanking region. Lastly, we demonstrated that recombinant p50 is capable of enhancing transcription from the bcl-2 P1 promoter and showed which sites likely contribute to transcription. As such, our data implicatebcl-2 as a target gene for p50/p50-mediated regulation and suggest that constitutive nuclear activation of p50 homodimers in LY-ar cells contributes to the overexpression of Bcl-2 observed for that cell type. Although our data strongly imply that p50 homodimers function to enhance transcription, there have been conflicting reports concerning the role p50/p50 plays in transcription. Some reports support the ability of p50 to transactivate, particularly in the presence of Bcl-3 (39Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D.

In addition, soluble forms of matriptase were isolated from human breast milk and breast cancer cell-conditioned medium. In this paper, we report a processing mechanism that appears to be required for the release of epithin. CHO-K1 or COS7 cells transfected with single full-length epithin cDNA generated two different-sized proteins in cell lysates, 110 and 92 kDa. The 92-kDa epithin was found to be an N-terminally truncated form of the 110-kDa epithin, and it was the only form detected in the culture medium. The 92-kDa epithin was also found on the cell surface, where it was anchored by the N-terminal fragment. The results of in vivo cell labeling experiments indicate that the 110-kDa epithin is rapidly processed to the 92-kDa epithin. Using site-directed mutagenesis experiments, we identified Gly149 of the GSVIA sequence in epithin as required for the processing and release of the protein. These results suggest that N-terminal processing of epithin at Gly149 is a necessary prerequisite step for release of the protein.

Previously, we reported the cloning of a mouse type II membrane serine protease, epithin, from a polymerase chain reaction-based subtractive cDNA library of isolated fetal thymic stromal cells (2Kim M.G. Chen C. Lyu M.S. Cho E.G. Park D. Kozak C. Schwartz R.H. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Northern analysis revealed that epithin mRNA was expressed in intestine, kidney, lung, thymus, and spleen, and enriched in the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)1 thymus. In the thymus, the message is present in the stromal compartment not in the thymocytes. The gene was mapped at 17 centimorgan from the centromere on the mouse chromosome 9. Epithin has a multidomain structure containing a putative N-terminal transmembrane region, two CUB domains, four LDLRA repeats, and a C-terminal serine protease domain (Fig. 1). The human orthologues of epithin, membrane type-serine protease 1 (MT-SP1) and its N-terminal truncated form, matriptase, have also been reported (Refs. 3Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar and 4Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol.

MT-SP1 cDNA was cloned from the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line and shares 81% amino acid identity with epithin. The purified serine protease domain of MT-SP1 expressed in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged fusion protein was found to be autoactivated during the purification process. Ecotin and variants of ecotin, which inhibit the differentiation of rat prostate and the growth of human PC-3 prostate cancer tumors, inhibited the activated protease domain of MT-SP1 at subnanomolar concentrations. These findings suggested a possible role for MT-SP1 in prostate differentiation and the growth of prostatic carcinomas (3Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Using a positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library and substrate phage technique, protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (sc-uPA) were identified as macromolecular substrates of MT-SP1 (5Takeuchi T. Harris J.L. Huang W. Yan K.W. Coughlin S.R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The identification of these molecules as putative in vivo substrates suggests that MT-SP1 regulates the functions mediated by PAR2, such as the inflammatory response or cell adhesion, and by uPA, such as tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Matriptase was initially identified as an 80-kDa matrix-degrading protease from conditioned medium of human breast cancer cells (6Lin C.Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and later it was purified from human breast milk as a complex with a kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor (7Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The isolated cDNA for matriptase appears to be a truncated form of MT-SP1, lacking the N-terminal 172 amino acids of the coding sequence (4Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Using active matriptase isolated from human milk, it has been demonstrated that the protein can convert hepatocyte growth factor/scattering factor to its active form in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, and can activate c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation in A549 human lung carcinoma cells (8Lee S.L. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36720-36725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Studies with MT-SP1/matriptase suggest that epithin and its human orthologue may play important roles in cell migration as well as cancer invasion and metastasis. The presence of an N-terminal transmembrane region in epithin/MT-SP1 led us to predict that these molecules would be localized in the membrane (2Kim M.G. Chen C. Lyu M.S. Cho E.G. Park D. Kozak C. Schwartz R.H. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Later it was shown that MT-SP1 is in fact on the plasma membrane by immunofluorescent microscopy and a cell surface biotinylation technique (5Takeuchi T. Harris J.L. Huang W. Yan K.W. Coughlin S.R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Interestingly, matriptase, which lacked the N-terminal transmembrane region in the initial protein preparation, was also found on the plasma membrane (6Lin C.Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This suggests either that there is an additional signal peptide other than the N-terminal transmembrane domain, or that matriptase noncovalently associates with other proteins in the membrane. Finally, the purification of matriptase from human breast cancer cell-conditioned medium (6Lin C.Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or from human breast milk (4Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) indicates the existence of soluble forms of epithin/MT-SP1, although the mechanism for producing such forms and their exact nature are not yet understood. In the present study, we first characterized the mouse epithin protease domain by showing its activation with trypsin-like serine proteases, including itself, and demonstrating its substrate specificity. We then presented evidence for both N-terminal processing of epithin during protein synthesis and subsequent release of the processed form from the cell membrane into the culture medium. Site-directed mutagenesis identified Gly149 in the N-terminal region as essential for both processing and release. These results suggest that translational processing is important for subsequent release of the protein to carry out its functions in the extracellular environment. COS7 cells, 427.1.86 cells, and 1308 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 10% CO2 incubator. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in F-12 nutrient mixture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 incubator. To obtain the conditioned medium from COS7, 427.1.86, and 1308 cells, they were each cultured in medium supplemented with insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) without FBS. The S2 cell line was grown in a flow hood in Complete DESTM Expression medium with l-glutamine (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 23 Â°C. The vector constructions follow. 1) pGEX-5X-1/epithin: the cDNA (nucleotides 1,287â3,106) containing the CUB2, LDLRA1â4, and serine protease domains was ligated into the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Pharmacia Biotech). 2) pcDNA3/epithin: the full-length epithin cDNA was ligated into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. 3) pcDNA3.1/HisB/epithin protease domain (EpiPD): the cDNA (nucleotides 1,754â3,067) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pcDNA3.1/His B vector (Invitrogen). The construct was designed to be in-frame with an N-terminal His tag and expressed the His-tagged LDLRA4 repeat along with the serine protease domain, spanning amino acids 565â855 of epithin. 4) pMT/BiP/V5-HisB/EpiPD: the cDNA (nucleotides 1,754â2,614) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated into pMT/BiP/V5-His B vector (Invitrogen). The construction was designed to be in-frame with a C-terminal His tag. The His-tagged LDLRA4 repeat plus protease domain, spanning amino acids 565â851 of epithin, was expressed under the control of the Drosophila metallothionein promoter, and could be secreted into the culture medium when the Drosophila S2 cells were induced with CuSO4. A glutathione S-transferase (GST)-epithin fusion protein encoded by pGEX-5X-1/epithin was expressed in bacterial cells and purified by affinity chromatography. Polyclonal antibodies against the purified GST/epithin (anti-epithin antiserum) and against the N-terminal peptide,12GSQDFGAGLKYNSR25 (anti-N antiserum), were produced in rabbits. The purified GST-epithin was also injected into BALB/c mice for the production of a monoclonal antibody, mAb5. Hybridomas were prepared by fusing spleen cells with cells of the myeloma line SP2/O-Ag14. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting were performed to ensure that mAb5 reacted with epithin. For the isotype mapping of mAb5 (IgG2a), mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping reagents (Sigma) were used on ascitic fluid (1â1000 dilution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)). The prepared mAb5 recognized the C-terminal end of epithin. This was demonstrated by Western blotting of cell lysates transfected with two different constructs, pcDNA3.1/HisB/EpiPD, which has the full C-terminal end of epithin, and pMT/BiP/V5-HisB/EpiPD, which does not have the C-terminal 4 amino acids because they have been replaced with a His tag. pcDNA3.1/HisB/EpiPD was in vitrotranslated as described below. Eighty Î¼l of Ni-nitrilo-tri-acetic acid (NTA)-agarose (Qiagen) was added to 50 Î¼l of the in vitro translation mixture and 870 Î¼l of PBS and then incubated on a rotator for 1 h at room temperature. The Ni-NTA and protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), and a final wash was done with a trypsin assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm CaCl2). After adding 200 Î¼l of fresh trypsin assay buffer to the bead complexes, the mixture was divided into aliquots and various concentrations of either trypsin (Sigma), with or without 100 Î¼m tosyl lysyl chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), or 15 nm chymotrypsin (Sigma) was added. The final 36 Î¼l of reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 Â°C and stopped with 2Ã Laemmli sodium dodecyl sulfate-reducing sample buffer. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), the gel was dried and exposed to Fuji x-ray film for 1 week. The pMT/BiP/V5-HisB/EpiPD construct was transfected into S2 cells using the calcium phosphate method. For the selection, the cells were maintained in complete medium containing 300 Î¼g/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3â4 weeks. For the purification of the protease domain, the stable S2 cells were cultured in 500 ml DESTM Serum-Free Medium (Invitrogen). When the cell density reached 2.3 Ã 105/ml, CuSO4 (500 Î¼m final concentration) was added to the culture medium, and the medium harvested 2 days after induction. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C, the medium was applied to a 1-ml Ni-NTA-agarose column. The column was then washed with 10 ml of washing buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) and eluted with 1 ml elution buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole). Elution was repeated five times. Concentration of the pooled fractions to a final 1-ml volume in trypsin assay buffer was achieved by using a Centricon YM-10 concentration system (Amicon, Millipore). Protein quantification was done by a dotMETRIC 1 Î¼l of PROTEIN ASSAY (Chemicon). The activity of the purified protease domain was assayed using the fluorogenic peptide substratesisopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranosideN-t-Boc-QAR-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC),N-t-Boc-AGPR-AMC,N-t-Boc-EKK-AMC, N-succinyl-AAPF-AMC,N-succinyl-LT-AMC, and N-succinyl-LLVY-AMC (Sigma). 10 ng of purified enzyme was added to 0.1 mm of each substrate in 20 Î¼l of 5Ã assay buffer (0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.2, 0.1 m CaCl2), and the final reaction volume of 100 Î¼l was made up by adding distilled water. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 Â°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 Î¼l of 30% acetic acid. After adding 850 Î¼l of distilled water, the released AMC was measured with a Spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu RF-540) configured with the excitation wavelength at 380 nm and the emission wavelength at 440 nm. For the determination of enzyme kinetics, 1 ng of the protease was used, and the measurements were plotted using Microcal Origin software version 3.5 (Microcal Software, Inc.). For the inhibitor assay, 1 ng of enzyme was preincubated with each inhibitor for 20 min, and then the protease activity was assayed using 0.1 mm N-t-Boc-QAR-AMC for 20 min as described above. In vitrotranslation of the pBlueScript/epithin under the T3 promoter was performed using the transcription/translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]Met. For the co-translational modification, 2.5 Î¼l of canine pancreatic microsomal membrane (Promega) were added to the 25 Î¼l of reaction mixture. For deglycosylation, stably transfected CHO-K1 cells on a 100-mm dish were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 100 Î¼m leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Î¼m pepstatin A, 1 mm EDTA). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Clarified lysates were incubated with anti-epithin antiserum for 4 h, followed by an additional incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the same lysis buffer, mixed with denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS and 1% Î²-mercaptoethanol), boiled at 100 Â°C for 10 min, and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was digested with 100 units of endoglycosidase Hf (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, for 10 min, and the other was used as a control without added enzyme. Finally, the reaction mixture was diluted with an SDS sample buffer, boiled at 100 Â°C for 3 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with mAb5. The pcDNA3/epithin constructs were transfected into COS7 cells for transient overexpression or into CHO-K1 cells for both transient and stable expression by using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). In brief, a complex of DNA (1 Î¼g) and the Plus (6 Î¼l)-LipofectAMINE (4 Î¼l) reagent was added to 2.5 Ã 105 COS7 or CHO-K1 cells in a 35-mm dish. At 48 h posttransfection, the cell lysate and conditioned medium of COS7 or CHO-K1 cells were harvested and used for Western blot or immunoprecipitation. For the selection and maintenance of CHO-K1 cells stably expressing epithin (CHO-K1/epithin cells), 700 Î¼g/ml of geneticin 418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the culture medium. An enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) protein biotinylation module (Amersham Life Science) was used to label the surface proteins of CHO-K1 cells following the manufacturer's protocol. The cells in a 35-mm dish were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and labeled with 20 Î¼l of biotinylation reagent in 1 ml of bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.6, on a rocking plate for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 1 ml of RIPA buffer on the rocking plate for 20 min, and the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-epithin antiserum and protein A-Sepharose. After SDS-PAGE, the bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Life Science). CHO-K1/epithin cells in two 100-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 Â°C. The cell pellet was lysed with RIPA buffer for 1 h at 4 Â°C and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C. Separate aliquots of supernatant were used for immunoprecipitation by either anti-N antiserum or anti-epithin antiserum. The samples were analyzed in a gradient SDS-PAGE gel (6â15%) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Gelman). The top and bottom halves of the membranes were separately immunoblotted with anti-epithin antiserum or anti-N antiserum, respectively. CHO-K1/epithin cells in a 35-mm dish were washed twice with Met- and Cys-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 20 min at 37 Â°C in pre-warmed Met- and Cys-free DMEM to deplete the intracellular pools of sulfur-containing amino acids. After the medium was removed, the cells were incubated in DMEM containing 100 Î¼Ci of [35S]Met/[35S]Cys (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, EXPRE 35S35S) for 5 min (pulse) at 37 Â°C. The cells were then rapidly washed twice with PBS and incubated for 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 min (chase) at 37 Â°C in fresh F-12 medium containing FBS. After washing twice with ice cold PBS, cell-free extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 Î¼m leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Î¼m pepstatin A, 1 mm EDTA) and immunoprecipitated with anti-epithin antiserum. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was soaked in destaining solution (10% acetic acid, 30% methanol in distilled water) for 1 h and dried. The dried gel was exposed to x-ray film (Fujifilm) for 24 h. Site-directed mutagenesis of the putative N-terminal processing site was performed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following mutagenic primers were used: primer 1, 5â²-CTGCCTTCAGTGAGaaCAGTGTCATCGCCTAC-3â², and primer 2, 5â²-GTAGGCGATGACACTGttCTCACTGAAGGCAG-3â². Mismatches are indicated by lowercase letters. The mutant construct was verified by DNA sequencing and then transfected into COS7 cells. At 48 h posttransfection, the cells and conditioned medium were harvested for Western blotting or immunoprecipitation. Cells in 100-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 Â°C. The cell pellet was lysed with 1 ml RIPA buffer for 1 h at 4 Â°C and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The conditioned medium (8 ml) from about 90% confluent cells was harvested and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The lysate and the conditioned medium (1 ml) were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-epithin antiserum and protein A-Sepharose. After SDS-PAGE, Western blotting was done with mAb5, and the bands were visualized using the ECL detection system. The protease domain of epithin contains the sequence RVVGG (Fig. 1, arrowhead). Cleavage at such a site (on the C-terminal side of Arg) by trypsin-like serine proteases is responsible for the activation of most zymogen serine proteases. Autoactivation of the human orthologue of epithin, MT-SP1 by cleavage at this site has been previously reported (3Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To test whether mouse epithin could be the specific substrate of trypsin-like serine proteases, we generated the construct pcDNA3.1/HisB/EpiPD (Fig.2 A), which can be in vitro translated. The translation product was purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography. The resulting 36-kDa (327 amino acids) protein was composed of three regions: 1) 36 amino acids containing a metal binding site, 2) the LDLRA4 repeat (38 amino acids), and 3) the serine protease domain (253 amino acids), including the RVVGG sequence. When the in vitro translated protein was incubated with a low concentration of trypsin, two major fragments (27 and 9 kDa) were generated (Fig. 2 B). The larger fragment corresponds in size to the mature enzyme of 241 amino acids and the smaller fragment to a prodomain composed of the metal binding site, the LDLRA4 repeat, and 12 amino acids from the N terminus of the protease domain (Fig. 2 A). This cleavage was blocked by TLCK, a trypsin-like serine protease inhibitor (Fig. 2 B,right-most lane) and was not observed with 15 nmchymotrypsin (data not shown). These results indicate that the protease domain of epithin can be efficiently cleaved by trypsin family serine proteases. To study epithin protease activity, we expressed the protease domain construct pMT/BiP/V5-HisB/EpiPD using a Drosophila expression system and purified the protein using metal-chelate affinity chromatography. The size of the expressed protein on reducing SDS-PAGE gels was 39 kDa. When the eluted fractions were pooled, concentrated, and resuspended in trypsin assay buffer, the single-chain zymogen protease domain was autocatalytically converted to its two-chain active form (data not shown) as previously reported for the MT-SP1 protease domain (3Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of the purified protease domain was tested by using AMC-tagged, synthetic peptide substrates that contained various amino acids at the P1 position (P1-Arg, Lys, Phe, Thr, or Tyr). The only substrates on which the enzyme showed prominent activity were those with P1-Lys or -Arg (Table I). The best of the screened substrates wasN-t-Boc-QAR-AMC. Interestingly, the sequence of the predicted cleavage site in epithin for protease activation is QARâVVGG. Thus, the relative specificity of the enzyme strongly suggests that the QARâVVGG sequence is the mouse epithin autoactivation site. This is in agreement with N-terminal sequencing result on activated protease from MT-SP1 (3Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Table IActivity of the epithin protease domain on various peptide substratesSubstrateReleased AMCpm Ã 104N-t-Boc-QAR-AMC1548.3N-t-Boc-AGPR-AMC134.3N-t-Boc-EKK-AMC131.4N-succinyl-AAPF-AMC0.4N-succinyl-LT-AMC0.3N-succinyl-LLVY-AMC0 Open table in a new tab The activity profile of the protease domain was further characterized using the N-t-Boc-QAR-AMC substrate. These experiments showed concentration- and time-dependent increases in activity (data not shown), yielding Km = 257 Î¼m, Kcat = 1.76 sâ1, and Kcat/Km = 6.85 Ã 103 mâ1 sâ1. The effect of inhibitors on the protease activity of epithin is summarized in TableII. The fact that leupeptin is one of the strongest inhibitors of epithin agrees with the results obtained with matriptase (9Shi Y.E. Torri J. Yieh L. Wellstein A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar). Ecotin, which has been used for the identification of MT-SP1 (3Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), was also a potent inhibitor for mouse epithin.Table IIEffects of various inhibitors on the activity of the epithin protease domainInhibitorConcentrationInhibition%Leupeptin10 Î¼m88Ecotin500 nm85DFP1 mm47PMSF1 mm41TLCK500 Î¼m41TPCK500 Î¼m17NEM1 mm0Idoacetamide1 mm0EDTA20 mm0 Open table in a new tab In our previous study, epithin was predicted to be a type II membrane serine protease with sixN-linked glycosylation sites (Ref. 1Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 857-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). The molecular mass of the predicted protein is about 95 kDa. In in vitro translation experiments, before microsomal modification, epithin cDNA encoded predominantly a 95-kDa protein under reducing conditions (Fig. 3 A,lane 1). Thus, the size of the translated protein matched that of the calculated molecular mass of epithin without glycosylation. After co-translational modification using microsomal membrane preparations, which can cleave signal sequences and glycosylate the target protein in vitro, the size of the translated protein increased to 110 kDa (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). This is consistent with the glycosylation of all six predictedN-linked carbohydrate addition sites in the epithin protein. In contrast to these in vitro translation studies, the stable expression of epithin in CHO-K1 cells revealed predominantly a 92-kDa protein (Epi-S), although a small amount of the 110-kDa protein (Epi-L) was also detected (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). The size of the Epi-L protein matches the fully modified epithin protein in the in vitro translation experiments. When the two epithin proteins from CHO-K1 extracts were treated with endoglycosidase Hf, which removes high-mannose oligosaccharides, the sizes of both forms were reduced by about 15 kDa (Fig. 3 B,lane 2). This indicates that both Epi-L and Epi-S are high-mannose type glycoproteins containing a similar degree of glycosylation. To examine the membrane localization of Epi-S and Epi-L, a surface biotinylation experiment was performed in CHO-K1/epithin cells. Both Epi-S and Epi-L were biotinylated and specifically immunoprecipitated with an anti-epithin antiserum (Fig.4 A, left panel). The recognition of the same proteins by a mAb5 directed against the carboxyl-terminal region of epithin confirmed that the immunoprecipitated proteins were both epithin (Fig. 4 A,right panel). Because biotinylation is restricted to the cell surface, this result indicates that both Epi-S and Epi-L are located on the surface of CHO-K1/epithin cells. To examine the relationship between Epi-L and Epi-S, we employed antibodies that recognize different parts of the epithin protein. The mAb5 against the C terminus recognized both Epi-L and Epi-S in a Western blot of CHO-K1/epithin cell lysates (Fig. 4 B, left panel). Interestingly, however, an anti-N antiserum, directed against the N-terminal peptide, recognized only Epi-L in the same blot (Fig. 4 B, right panel). This observation indicates that Epi-S lacks the N terminus of epithin. The apparent molecular mass of 92 kDa in SDS-PAGE and the lack of immunoreactivity with anti-N antiserum suggested that Epi-S might be generated from Epi-L by N-terminal truncation of an 18-kDa polypeptide, which would include the transmembrane domain. To investigate how Epi-S could localize to the plasma membrane without an N-terminal-containing transme"

We found conditions to increase the cholesterol/phospholipid (C/P) molar ratio on the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes from 0.5 to 0.87, without significant physical damage or change in morphology to the oocytes. In addition, we developed conditions to deplete endogenous cholesterol from oocytes using a methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin incubation procedure without causing membrane instability of the cells. Methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin was also used to examine the reversibility of the inhibitory effect of cholesterol on AChR function. Depletion of 43% of endogenous cholesterol from oocytes (C/P = 0.3) did not show any significant change in macroscopic response of the wild type, whereas in the Î±C418W mutant the same cholesterol depletion caused a dramatic gain-in-function response of this lipid-exposed mutation in addition to the increased response caused by the mutation itself. Increasing the C/P ratio to 0.87 caused an inhibition of the macroscopic response of the Torpedo wild type of about 52%, whereas the Î±C418W mutation showed an 81% inhibition compared with the responses of control oocytes. The wild type receptor did not recover from this inhibition when the excess cholesterol was depleted to near normal C/P ratios; however, the Î±C418W mutant displayed 63% of the original current, which indicates that the inhibition of this lipid-exposed mutant was significantly reversed. The ability of the Î±C418W mutation to recover from the inhibition caused by cholesterol enrichment suggests that the interaction of cholesterol with this lipid-exposed mutation is significantly different from that of the wild type. The present data demonstrate that a single lipid-exposed position in the AChR could alter the modulatory effect of cholesterol on AChR function.

A consensus model for the nAChR topology deduced from hydrophobicity profiles for protein sequences obtained from cDNA sequences indicates that each subunit contains at least four membrane-spanning regions denoted M1 through M4 with both N and C termini located on the extracellular side (7Dipaola M. Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15457-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This integral membrane protein has been extensively used for the study of lipid-protein interactions.Previous biophysical studies of the nAChR used cholesterol as a probe for the study of lipid-protein interactions. Most of the information available on the sensitivity of the nAChR to the lipid environment was obtained using reconstituted membranes of purified Torpedo californica AChR. However, despite a wealth of experimental data from reconstituted systems, the role of membrane cholesterol in regulating AChR function has not been completely elucidated, and some of the results have remained controversial and sometimes even contradictory. The contradictory results in the literature regarding the specific lipid requirements of the nAChR may reflect a variety of conditions, including the fact that the functional status of the nAChR in most cases was performed in reconstituted membranes with the additional lipid of interest tested at a molar percentage of the total membrane lipids different from the natural membranes. The relative level of a given lipid may be the key factor in determining the fraction of AChR in a functional conformation as well as the kinetics of the conformational change.In reconstituted membranes, the ability of the nAChR to conduct cations across the membrane and to undergo conformational transitions from the resting to the desensitized state (R â D) has been shown to be very sensitive to the lipid composition (8Ochoa E.L. Dalziel A.W. McNamee M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 727: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Fong T.M. McNamee M.G.

The mechanism by which lipid modulates the ability of nAChR to undergo an agonist-induced conformational change remains unclear. A previous proposal suggested the possibility that cholesterol regulation of membrane fluidity might play a key role in the modulation of AChR function (9Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 830-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar); however, subsequent work challenged the fluidity hypothesis (11Sunshine C. McNamee M.G. Biochim. Biophys.

A recent Fourier transform infrared study using reconstituted membranes of purified nAChR raised the fluidity hypothesis again (13Baenziger J.E. Morris M.L. Darsaut T.E. Ryan S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 777-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This study proposed that the membrane fluidity modulates the relative population of nAChRs in the resting and desensitized states. The data from reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cholesterol interacts at some discrete class of binding sites on the receptor (14Narayanaswami V. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12420-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Jones O.T. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2364-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Recently, the binding sites for cholesterol at the protein interface of the Torpedo nAChR were mapped using a novel photoreactive analog of cholesterol (125I-azido-cholesterol) (16Corbing J. Wang H.H. Blanton M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1414: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This study found that cholesterol-binding sites were exclusive to the alpha M4 and M1 and gamma M4 transmembrane segments. The binding kinetics of ethidium bromide to the reconstituted Torpedo nobiliananAChR suggest that in the absence of cholesterol the receptor is âlockedâ in the R conformation (17Rankin S.E.

This value corresponds to a C/P molar ratio of about 0.42 that is slightly lower than the molar ratio that we found in the Xenopus oocyteplasmatic membrane.In the present work we manipulate the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratios in the oocyte membrane to reach higher membrane cholesterol levels (C/P = 0.87) than the ratios studied in the reconstituted system. We also depleted endogenous cholesterol from oocytes to reach C/P molar ratios similar to the ones previously examined in the reconstituted system. The voltage clamp technique was used to examine the effect of cholesterol on T. californica nAChR function, including the effect on a novel lipid-exposed Î±C418W mutation that has been shown to increase the macroscopic response (19Lee Y.H.

Our data show that the interaction of cholesterol with Torpedo wild type is remarkably different from the interaction with the Î±C418W mutant. These results raise the importance of the functional role of lipid-protein interactions in ion-channel function and underscore the importance of cysteine 418 in the Î± subunit of the TorpedonAChR in the modulatory action of cholesterol. This approach will open a new dimension for studying lipid effects on ion-channel function.RESULTSWe began our study of the effects of cholesterol on the function of the acetylcholine receptor by developing a strategy to dynamically change the cholesterol levels in the surface of X. laevisoocytes. We took advantage of a recently developed fluorescent cholesterol analog (22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3-ol) to monitor cholesterol incorporation into the surface membrane of cells following the incubation with cholesterol-enriched liposomes using a confocal microscope (Fig. 1). An important consideration in these studies was to significantly enrich the surface membrane of cells without altering intracellular cholesterol concentration. A series of confocal sections of an oocyte exposed to the liposomes containing the cholesterol fluorescent analog are shown in Fig. 1 (left). We found that under our controlled conditions cholesterol was preferentially incorporated into the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, right). Using this approach we estimated the approximate time of liposome exposure required to reach a cholesterol to phospholipid molar ratio (C/P) of 0.87.Cholesterol Enrichment and AChR FunctionThe cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio of the plasma membrane of oocytes was in the range of 0.33â0.62 in seven batches of oocytes tested, and the mean value obtained was 0.51 Â± 0.10 (Fig.2). However, there seems to be variability in the C/P molar ratio that appears to be seasonal. As shown in Fig. 2, the enrichment produced oocytes with a C/P molar ratio in the order of 0.87. This C/P molar ratio is higher than the molar ratios reported in reconstitution experiments of the T. californica AChR (17Rankin S.E. Addona G.H. Kloczewiak M.A. Bugge B. Miller K.W. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The resting membrane potential of the oocytes was only modestly affected during the 45-min period of cholesterol enrichment (Fig.3 A). The shift in membrane potential was overcome by voltage-clamping oocytes at â70 mV for measuring nAChR currents. The moderate hyperpolarization observed during the first 15 min could be caused by an inhibitory effect of cholesterol on the membrane-bound pumps, which are responsible for the upkeep of the underlying ionic gradients. Interestingly, we observed that in almost all the cholesterol-enriched oocytes, exposure to methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin restored the membrane potential by inducing a hyperpolarization that was in the range of â5 to â20 mV. Thus, under the conditions that we used, cholesterol seems to play a modulatory role in maintaining the resting membrane potential of the oocyte. Fig.4 A shows three typical experimental results in which an oocyte was voltage-clamped at â70 mV and perfused with 100 Î¼m acetylcholine (ACh) before (left) and after (right) cholesterol enrichment. In cholesterol-enriched oocytes (C/P = 0.87) theTorpedo wild type AChR displays a macroscopic current inhibition of about 51.5% (n = 20) compared with the control oocytes. Fig. 4 C shows the same experiment for the lipid-exposed mutation Î±C418W, and the same cholesterol enrichment protocol leads to a 80.5% inhibition (n = 16 oocytes) for this mutation. This result indicates that the functional response of the Î±C418W is more sensitive to the presence of higher levels of cholesterol in the plasma membrane than the wild type. Fig.4 B represents an average of the response of control oocytes that were incubated in MOR2 only for the 45 min of incubation (i.e. no added cholesterol present). The macroscopic current was recorded at â70 mV with 100 Î¼m ACh as in the enriched oocyte. This control was performed to subtract the current that appears in the absence of cholesterol that might be due to an apparent gain-in-function due to the assembly of new surface nAChRs. As shown in Fig. 4 (B and D) the negative percentage of inhibition of the macroscopic response represents an increase in the current. This means that, after exposing the oocyte for the first time to ACh, there is a very small increase in the wild type response (2%) response whereas in the Î±C418W the response is higher (33%) than for the wild type. If the Î±C418W produced a higher response after the first exposure to ACh, this suggests that the inhibition of this mutation could be even higher than the 80.5% detected in our protocol. Fig. 5 A shows a family of macroscopic currents from oocytes expressing the Î±C418W mutant before (left) and after cholesterol enrichment (right). The dose-response curves for the control and cholesterol-enriched oocytes expressing the Î±C418W are shown in Fig. 5 B. From the reduction in the macroscopic response, it is clear that cholesterol produced a substantial inhibitory response for the Î±C418W, however; the EC50 for ACh seems to be similar after the enrichment. Fig. 5 C shows a family of macroscopic currents for an oocyte expressing wild type before (left) and after cholesterol enrichment (right). The dose-response curves for the normal and cholesterol-enriched oocytes expressing wild type are shown in Fig.5 D. The EC50 values for the inhibited state in the cholesterol-enriched oocyte appear to be similar to the control experiments for wild type and the Î±C418W, suggesting that the loss in functional response could be due to a reduction in the number of resting nAChR rather than an inhibitory effect on the ion-channel function. To estimate the overall reduction in the macroscopic response, ACh-induced currents of cholesterol-enriched oocytes were normalized to the equivalent maximum current of control oocytes. As shown in Fig. 5 E, after cholesterol enrichment, the wild type displayed a fraction of 0.62 of the original current at the highest ACh concentration used, whereas for the Î±C418W mutant only about 0.1 of the original current was detected after the enrichment.Figure 2Estimation of cholesterol/phospholipid ( C/P ) molar ratios. For each experiment 15 oocytes were used. For the control oocytes the calculated C/P molar ratio average in seven experiments (n = 105 oocytes) was 0.51. After cholesterol enrichment the C/P molar ratio average was 0.87 (six experiments, n = 90 oocytes). For cholesterol-depleted oocytes the C/P molar ratio had an average of 0.3 (four experiments, n = 60 oocytes). In oocytes that were incubated with methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin after cholesterol enrichment, there was a reduction of 0.12 in the C/P molar ratio with a final average of 0.75. Note that the differences were calculated based on the evaluation of the control oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Membrane potential changes during cholesterol enrichment or depletion. Membrane potential was monitored during 45 min of cholesterol enrichment (A) or cholesterol depletion (B); (n = 3 oocytes in both cases). During cholesterol enrichment the membrane potential shifted with a biphasic behavior. First a moderate decrease in the range of 10â15 mV during the first 15 min was followed by a slow membrane repolarization (A). Cholesterol depletion caused a moderate decrease in the membrane potential of oocytes during the first 15 min of methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin exposure that was in the range of 10â15 mV. After 20 min of methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin exposure, the oocytes gradually recovered their membrane potential (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Cholesterol enrichment produces an inhibitory response of the AChR.

After the incubation, oocytes were washed three times with 1 ml of MOR2 and perfused again with 100 Î¼m ACh.

Families of macroscopic current traces for the Î±C418W and WT before and after cholesterol enrichment are shown in A and C, respectively. The ACh concentrations used for the generation of the family of currents were 1.0, 3.0, 10, 30, 100, and 300 Î¼m. Oocytes were clamped at â70 mV. After cholesterol enrichment (C/P = 0.87) the dose-response curves for the Î±C418W (B) and WT (D) remain similar to the control. The EC50 of the Î±C418W (n = 3) was 2.7 Â± 0.6 Î¼m before and 2.3 Â± 0.1 Î¼m after cholesterol enrichment. For the WT (n = 3) the EC50 was 22.6 Â± 0.2 Î¼m before and 27.2 Â± 0.5 Î¼m after cholesterol enrichment. ACh-induced currents of the cholesterol-enriched oocytes (right currents) are normalized to the equivalent ACh-induced currents previous to the cholesterol enrichment (left current traces). Data from three to six different oocytes were normalized to provide a statistical average of the decrease in macroscopic response for the WT and Î±C418W mutant (E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cholesterol Depletion ExperimentsThese experiments were designed to examine the functional response of the Torpedowild type and Î±C418W mutant in a reduced cholesterol environment. The resting membrane potential and the physical condition of oocytes were not affected during the methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin incubation period. During cholesterol depletion we observed a moderate hyperpolarization in the membrane potential of oocytes during the first 15 min that was in the range of 10â15 mV. However, after 25 min the potential gradually recovered (Fig. 3 B). After the depletion protocol, oocytes showed C/P molar ratios in the range of 0.19â0.44; the average C/P obtained in 11 batches of oocytes tested was 0.3 Â± 0.1 (n = 60 oocytes tested) as shown in Fig. 2. Oocytes expressing wild type and the Î±C418W mutant were perfused with 100 Î¼m ACh and then exposed to methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (50 Î¼m) in MOR2 for 45 min. Immediately after incubation oocytes were washed, voltage-clamped, and perfused with 100 Î¼m ACh. Macroscopic currents from a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 6(AâD). Fig. 6 A shows one control experiment in which an oocyte is voltage-clamped at â70 mV and perfused with 100 Î¼m ACh (left) to give a macroscopic current. It was then perfused with MOR2 for 5 min (with no ACh), incubated in MOR2 for 45 min and afterward voltage-clamped again under the same conditions (right). In Fig. 6 B an oocyte expressing the wild type nAChR was voltage-clamped at â70 mV and perfused with 100 Î¼m ACh (left) to give a macroscopic current. Then it was perfused with MOR2 for 5 min (with no ACh) and exposed to methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin for 45 min and voltage-clamped again under the same conditions (â70 mV, 100 Î¼m ACh) (right). As shown in Fig.6 E, exposure of an oocyte expressing the wild type AChR to methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, which leads to a range between 17 and 46% with an average of 43% of decrease in the plasma membrane cholesterol levels (C/P = 0.3), does not seem to affect the wild type. Fig. 6(C and D) shows the same experiments, including the control (C) for oocytes expressing the Î±C418W mutant. As shown in Fig. 6 D, the Î±C418W shows a significant increase in macroscopic response after the depletion protocol. It is remarkable that this increase in macroscopic current response is caused by a single amino acid replacement at the lipid protein interface. Fig.6 F shows the average response of cholesterol depletion experiments for the Î±C418W mutant and its relation to control experiments. To estimate the net increase in the macroscopic response after cholesterol depletion, we estimated the difference between the potentiation in macroscopic response between the experimental and control oocytes. For the wild type the difference is less than 5% whereas for the Î±C418W mutant the potentiation effect is 67%.Figure 6Cholesterol depletion produces an increase of the macroscopic response. Current traces were recorded at 100 Î¼m ACh, â70mV before (left) and after (right) 45 min of methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin exposure. In oocytes expressing wild type AChR (A and B), the average current after cholesterol depletion increased by 6.6%, as estimated from the difference between the experimental and control oocyte values (cholesterol-depleted 8.6â2.0% control;n = 11) (E). In oocytes expressing the Î±C418W AChR (C and D), the average current after cholesterol depletion was 66% (100% cholesterol-depleted â34% control; n = 22) (F). Note that the increase of macroscopic response is more dramatic in the mutant Î±C418W. The C/P molar ratio in control oocytes is 0.51 and 0.30 in the cholesterol-depleted oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the effect of cholesterol depletion on nAChR function we constructed dose-responses curves before and after cholesterol depletion experiments (Fig.7). After cholesterol depletion, the dose-response curve of the wild type remains very similar to that of the control (Fig. 7 A), suggesting that a reduced number of channels, rather than inhibition of the channel gating mechanism, caused the observed effects. The average EC50 value of the control oocytes expressing wild type AChR before and after depletion was 23 and 18 Î¼m, respectively (n = 4 oocytes). In contrast, the EC50 of the Î±C418W shifted from 4.2 Î¼m (control) to 0.9 Î¼m(n = 5 oocytes) after cholesterol depletion (Fig.7 B). The experimental data strongly suggest that cholesterol depletion did not produce any significant effects on theTorpedo wild type, whereas in a cholesterol-depleted environment the Î±C418W mutation displayed a significant gain in function response.Figure 7Cholesterol depletion reduced the Î±C418W EC50. The ACh concentrations used for the generation of dose-response curves were 1.0, 3.0, 10, 30, 100, and 300 Î¼m ACh at â70 mV. After cholesterol depletion (C/P = 0.3) the dose-response curve of the WT (A) remains very similar to the control (23.0 Â± 0.5 Î¼m to 18.0 Â± 0.8 Î¼m;n = 4). In contrast, the EC50 of the Î±C418W (B) shifted from 4.2 Â± 0.3 Î¼m(control) to 0.9 Â± 0.1 Î¼m after this moderate cholesterol depletion (n = 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cholesterol Enrichment and DepletionThese experiments were designed to examine if the inhibition detected in cholesterol enrichment experiments could be reversed by treating the oocytes with methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin. Oocytes expressing wild type or the Î±C418W mutation were perfused with 100 Î¼m ACh and then exposed to cholesterol enrichment. The macroscopic response was assessed using voltage clamping with 100 Î¼m ACh immediately after cholesterol enrichment (C/P = 0.87). Methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (50 Î¼m) in MOR2 was applied for 45 min after which the macroscopic response was measured at 100 Î¼m ACh (Fig.8). We estimate that this protocol removes 14% of the excess cholesterol (Fig. 2) and the C/P molar ratio was 0.75, higher than in a control oocyte (C/P = 0.51). Typical macroscopic currents obtained from these experiments for the wild type and Î±C418W mutant are shown in Fig. 8, A and B, respectively. Cholesterol enrichment reduced the wild type response by 79.7% (n = 8), and after a 14% depletion there was no significant change in the macroscopic response of the wild type. The same treatment in the Î±C418W mutant reduced the macroscopic current by 62.3% (n = 12), but after cholesterol depletion (Fig. 8 B), 63% of the original current was recovered.Figure 8The Î±C418W mutant recovers from inhibition by cholesterol. Oocytes expressing wild type (top) (A) and the Î±C418W mutant (B) were first perfused with 100 Î¼m ACh (at â70 mV) and then exposed to a 45-min period of cholesterol enrichment followed by 45 min of cyclodextrin exposure. The amount of current in nanoamps for each step is indicated below the macroscopic current trace. The percentage of the initial response after cholesterol enrichment (C/P = 0.87) (+ Chol bar) for WT was 20.4% (n = 8) (C) and 37.8% for the Î±C418W mutant (n = 12) (D). After depletion of a fraction of the overloaded cholesterol, the average C/P ratio of the oocytes tested was 0.75. The WT did not recover (26.1% of the original current (n = 8, Chol + CD inC) from the inhibition by cholesterol whereas the C418W mutation recovered 63% of the original current (n = 12, Chol + CD in D) after this moderated cholesterol depletion. Control experiments in the absence of CD showed some degree of recuperation for the Î±C418W that was not observed for wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONPrevious biophysical studies of the nAChR used cholesterol as a probe for the study of lipid-protein interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2051211734,"SNIP1 is a 396-amino acid nuclear protein shown to be an inhibitor of the TGF-Î² signal transduction pathway and to be important in suppressing transcriptional activation dependent on the co-activators CBP and p300. In this report we show that SNIP1 potently inhibits the activity of NF-ÎºB, which binds the C/H1 domain of CBP/p300, but does not interfere with the activity of transcription factors such as p53, which bind to other domains of p300, or factors such as VP16, which are independent of these co-activators. Inhibition of NF-ÎºB activity is a function of the N-terminal domain of SNIP1 and involves competition of SNIP1 and the NF-ÎºB subunit, RelA/p65, for binding to p300, similar to the mechanism of inhibition of Smad signaling by SNIP1. Immunohistochemical staining shows that expression of SNIP1 is strictly regulated in development and that it colocalizes, in certain tissues, with nuclear staining for RelA/p65 and for p300, suggesting that they may regulate NF-ÎºB activity in vivo in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. These data led us to suggest that SNIP1 may be an inhibitor of multiple transcriptional pathways that require the C/H1 domain of CBP/p300."

Here we report that MM-1 showed features of a tumor suppressor. In an EST data base search for cDNAs homologous to MM-1, we found a frequent substitution of amino acid 157 of MM-1, from alanine to arginine (A157R), and the substitution was observed more in tumor cells than in normal cells. A survey of the A157R mutation of MM-1 in 57 cultured cancer cells and 90 tissues from cancer patients showed that the A157R was present in about 50â60% of leukemia/lymphoma cells and in more than 75% of squamous cell carcinoma of tongue cancer. Although both the A157R and the wild-type MM-1 bound to c-Myc, only A157R lost the activities to repress both the E-box-dependent transcriptional activity of c-Myc and themyc/ras cooperative transforming activity in rat 3Y1 cells.

These binding proteins are thought to modulate c-Myc function, and mutation of the proteins or disregulated expression of their genes may lead to cell transformation by c-Myc. Although it has been shown that translocation of c-myc gene to an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene occurs in Burkitt lymphoma (31Leder P. Battey J. Lenoir G. Moulding C. Murphy W. Potter H. Stewart T. Taub R. Science. 1983; 222: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), other molecular mechanisms leading to cell transformation by c-Myc have not been clarified, but several models have been proposed. In Burkitt lymphoma, point mutations of amino acids within the N-terminal region of c-Myc, especially threonine at amino acid 58 or serine at 62, have been frequently observed. p107, an Rb-family tumor suppressor protein, loses its activity to bind to the N-terminal region of c-Myc due to these point mutations, thereby releasing free active c-Myc (9Gu W. Bhatia K. Magrath I.T. Dang C.V. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1994; 264: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), although a controversial result has been reported (10Beijersbergen R.L. Hijmans E.M. Zhu L. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4080-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutations of amino acid 58 and 62 also prolong the stability of c-Myc, leading to disregulated activation of target genes such as cell cycle-regulating genes (32Hoang A.T. Lutterbach B. Lewis B.C. Yano T. Chou T.Y. Barrett J.F. Raffeld M. Hann S.R. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4031-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In familial adenomatous polyposis, mutation of APC, a tumor suppressor, prevents Î²-catenin from degradation, leading to the accumulation of Î²-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex on the c-mycpromoter to activate disregulated c-myc expression (33He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 509-512Crossref Scopus (4047) Google Scholar). p15, an inhibitor of Cdk4, is known to be a tumor suppressor, and it has recently been reported that the p15 gene is up-regulated by Miz-1 by binding to the initiator region of the p15 gene. This activity of Miz-1 to activate the p15 gene is abrogated by formation of Miz-1Â·c-Myc complex that loses DNA binding activity, thereby progressing the cell cycle (34Staller P. Peukert K.

Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). TRRAP, a protein related to the ATM/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, binds to the N-terminal transactivation region of c-Myc and recruits an hGCN5 that possesses histone acetyltransferase activity (15McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 36McMahon S.B. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This activity of TRRAP may be necessary for both transcription and cell transforming activities of c-Myc. Mutation of Miz-1 or TRRAP in cancer cells, however, has not been reported.In addition to a transactivation domain, Myc box II in the N-proximal region of c-Myc also contains a transrepression domain, and several genes repressed by c-Myc have been reported (6Obaya A.J. Mateyak M.K. Sedivy J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 37Li L.H. Nerlov C. Prendergast G. MacGregor D. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that transrepression function of c-Myc is correlated more strongly with the transforming activity of c-Myc than is its transactivation function (5Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2913-3016Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 6Obaya A.J. Mateyak M.K. Sedivy J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We identified a novel protein, MM-1, that binds to this repression domain and represses E-box-dependent transcription activity of c-Myc (18Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which MM-1 represses c-Myc activity, however, has not been elucidated.In this study, we found that a point mutation from alanine to arginine at amino acid 157 in MM-1 frequently occurred in cells from lymphoma, leukemia, and tongue cancer and that this mutation abrogated the inhibitory functions of MM-1 to c-Myc. Human MM-1 gene was mapped at chromosome 12q12â12q13, where many chromosome abnormalities in cancer cells have been reported. Thus, MM-1 is a candidate for a tumor suppressor.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we first determined the genomic structure and chromosome location of the human MM-1 gene that codes for MM-1, a negative regulator of c-Myc, and then revealed that MM-1 is a candidate for a tumor suppressor in leukemia, lymphoma, and tongue cancer. As described under âResults,â about one-third of the nucleotide sequence from the 5â²-end of MM-1 cDNA that we have reported was found to be derived from sequences of chromosome 14 or human endogenous retrovirus type K, thereby leading to the addition of 13 amino acids to the N terminus of MM-1 originating from chromosome 12. Since the results described in our previous report (18Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the results of the current experiments showed no difference between the properties of the fused-type MM-1 and MM-1, we used the fused-type MM-1 throughout this study. In the present study, we also identified at least 4 alternative splicing variants of MM-1 (MM-1Î±, MM-1Î², MM-1Î³, and MM-1Î´), and MM-1 originating from chromosome 12 was renamed MM-1Î±. Characterization of these variants will be described elsewhere.MM-1 was found to be expressed coordinately with c-Myc during G1 and S phases of the cell cycle and re-expressed after the G2 phase, which might affect the functions of MM-1 that are dependent on and independent of c-Myc. MM-1 is located mainly in the cell nucleus, where c-Myc is co-localized (18Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It has been reported, on the other hand, that MM-1 is a subunit of prefoldin/Gim, a new chaperon protein complex sorting unfolded proteins to a chaperonin in which unfolded proteins are folded (43Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 44Siegers K. Waldmann T. Leroux M.R. Grein K. Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Prefoldin/Gim is composed of six subunits, including putative transcription factors and a VHL-binding protein, and MM-1 has been identified as prefoldin 5/Gim 5 (43Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 44Siegers K. Waldmann T. Leroux M.R. Grein K. Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). MM-1 in prefoldin/Gim is therefore thought to function independently of c-Myc.A substitution from Ala to Arg at amino acid 157 in MM-1 was frequently observed in tissue culture cells and cells from patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and tongue cancer. Since other genomic DNAs possessing very similar sequences to that of the MM-1 gene in chromosome 12 exist in several chromosomes such as 11, 7, and X, and these prevent specific primers from being set for the direct sequencing by PCR on genomic DNA as template, the DNA fragments including this mutation site were first amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA or total RNAs as templates and then cloned into plasmid vectors for sequencing. We usually sequenced more than three clones in one sample and classified MM-1 as an Arg mutant when at least a clone contained an Arg substitution. This analysis did not enable precise determination of whether the Arg mutation is homozygous or heterozygous. Furthermore, to determine whether this mutation is hereditary or sporadic,MM-1 genes from a family of lymphoma patient were analyzed, and no mutations were found in this family members. We are currently carrying out linkage analysis using many more samples to try to clarify the above possibilities regarding the MM-1 gene. FISH analysis showed that the MM-1 gene is located at chromosome 12q12â12q13. A search of the data base of the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project of NCBI revealed that this region has been reported to be a hot spot of chromosome abnormalities in cancer cells, including inversion, translocation, and deletion in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, liposarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, lipoma, clear cell sarcoma, germ cell tumor, acute myeloid leukemia, or adenocarcinoma.MM-1, a protein associated with c-Myc at myc box II in the transactivation domain, repressed the E-box-dependent transcriptional activity of c-Myc (18Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and also themyc/ras cooperative cell transforming activity. The cell growth was arrested when the expression vector for MM-1 was introduced. MM-1 was thus thought to be a tumor suppressor that might suppress tumor progression by c-Myc via control of the transcriptional activity of c-Myc. Moreover, these activities of MM-1 as a tumor suppressor were abrogated by a point mutation at amino acid 157 of MM-1 from Ala to Arg, frequently found in cells of leukemia, lymphoma, and carcinoma of the tongue. Cells may have more chances to be transformed when MM-1 carries an A157R-like mutation and has lost its tumor suppressing activity. c-Myc is a transcription factor, and it plays key functions in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Henriksson M.

These binding proteins are thought to modulate c-Myc function, and mutation of the proteins or disregulated expression of their genes may lead to cell transformation by c-Myc. Although it has been shown that translocation of c-myc gene to an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene occurs in Burkitt lymphoma (31Leder P. Battey J. Lenoir G. Moulding C. Murphy W. Potter H. Stewart T. Taub R. Science. 1983; 222: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), other molecular mechanisms leading to cell transformation by c-Myc have not been clarified, but several models have been proposed. In Burkitt lymphoma, point mutations of amino acids within the N-terminal region of c-Myc, especially threonine at amino acid 58 or serine at 62, have been frequently observed. p107, an Rb-family tumor suppressor protein, loses its activity to bind to the N-terminal region of c-Myc due to these point mutations, thereby releasing free active c-Myc (9Gu W. Bhatia K. Magrath I.T. Dang C.V. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1994; 264: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), although a controversial result has been reported (10Beijersbergen R.L. Hijmans E.M. Zhu L. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4080-4086Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutations of amino acid 58 and 62 also prolong the stability of c-Myc, leading to disregulated activation of target genes such as cell cycle-regulating genes (32Hoang A.T. Lutterbach B. Lewis B.C. Yano T. Chou T.Y. Barrett J.F. Raffeld M. Hann S.R. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4031-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In familial adenomatous polyposis, mutation of APC, a tumor suppressor, prevents Î²-catenin from degradation, leading to the accumulation of Î²-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex on the c-mycpromoter to activate disregulated c-myc expression (33He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 509-512Crossref Scopus (4047) Google Scholar). p15, an inhibitor of Cdk4, is known to be a tumor suppressor, and it has recently been reported that the p15 gene is up-regulated by Miz-1 by binding to the initiator region of the p15 gene. This activity of Miz-1 to activate the p15 gene is abrogated by formation of Miz-1Â·c-Myc complex that loses DNA binding activity, thereby progressing the cell cycle (34Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 35Seoane J. Pouponnot C. Staller P. Schader M. Eilers M. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). TRRAP, a protein related to the ATM/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, binds to the N-terminal transactivation region of c-Myc and recruits an hGCN5 that possesses histone acetyltransferase activity (15McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 36McMahon S.B. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This activity of TRRAP may be necessary for both transcription and cell transforming activities of c-Myc. Mutation of Miz-1 or TRRAP in cancer cells, however, has not been reported. In addition to a transactivation domain, Myc box II in the N-proximal region of c-Myc also contains a transrepression domain, and several genes repressed by c-Myc have been reported (6Obaya A.J. Mateyak M.K. Sedivy J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 37Li L.H. Nerlov C. Prendergast G. MacGregor D. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that transrepression function of c-Myc is correlated more strongly with the transforming activity of c-Myc than is its transactivation function (5Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2913-3016Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 6Obaya A.J. Mateyak M.K. Sedivy J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We identified a novel protein, MM-1, that binds to this repression domain and represses E-box-dependent transcription activity of c-Myc (18Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which MM-1 represses c-Myc activity, however, has not been elucidated. In this study, we found that a point mutation from alanine to arginine at amino acid 157 in MM-1 frequently occurred in cells from lymphoma, leukemia, and tongue cancer and that this mutation abrogated the inhibitory functions of MM-1 to c-Myc. Human MM-1 gene was mapped at chromosome 12q12â12q13, where many chromosome abnormalities in cancer cells have been reported. Thus, MM-1 is a candidate for a tumor suppressor. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we first determined the genomic structure and chromosome location of the human MM-1 gene that codes for MM-1, a negative regulator of c-Myc, and then revealed that MM-1 is a candidate for a tumor suppressor in leukemia, lymphoma, and tongue cancer. As described under âResults,â about one-third of the nucleotide sequence from the 5â²-end of MM-1 cDNA that we have reported was found to be derived from sequences of chromosome 14 or human endogenous retrovirus type K, thereby leading to the addition of 13 amino acids to the N terminus of MM-1 originating from chromosome 12. Since the results described in our previous report (18Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the results of the current experiments showed no difference between the properties of the fused-type MM-1 and MM-1, we used the fused-type MM-1 throughout this study. In the present study, we also identified at least 4 alternative splicing variants of MM-1 (MM-1Î±, MM-1Î², MM-1Î³, and MM-1Î´), and MM-1 originating from chromosome 12 was renamed MM-1Î±. Characterization of these variants will be described elsewhere.MM-1 was found to be expressed coordinately with c-Myc during G1 and S phases of the cell cycle and re-expressed after the G2 phase, which might affect the functions of MM-1 that are dependent on and independent of c-Myc. MM-1 is located mainly in the cell nucleus, where c-Myc is co-localized (18Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It has been reported, on the other hand, that MM-1 is a subunit of prefoldin/Gim, a new chaperon protein complex sorting unfolded proteins to a chaperonin in which unfolded proteins are folded (43Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 44Siegers K. Waldmann T. Leroux M.R. Grein K. Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Prefoldin/Gim is composed of six subunits, including putative transcription factors and a VHL-binding protein, and MM-1 has been identified as prefoldin 5/Gim 5 (43Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 44Siegers K. Waldmann T. Leroux M.R. Grein K. Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). MM-1 in prefoldin/Gim is therefore thought to function independently of c-Myc.A substitution from Ala to Arg at amino acid 157 in MM-1 was frequently observed in tissue culture cells and cells from patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and tongue cancer. Since other genomic DNAs possessing very similar sequences to that of the MM-1 gene in chromosome 12 exist in several chromosomes such as 11, 7, and X, and these prevent specific primers from being set for the direct sequencing by PCR on genomic DNA as template, the DNA fragments including this mutation site were first amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA or total RNAs as templates and then cloned into plasmid vectors for sequencing. We usually sequenced more than three clones in one sample and classified MM-1 as an Arg mutant when at least a clone contained an Arg substitution. This analysis did not enable precise determination of whether the Arg mutation is homozygous or heterozygous. Furthermore, to determine whether this mutation is hereditary or sporadic,MM-1 genes from a family of lymphoma patient were analyzed, and no mutations were found in this family members. We are currently carrying out linkage analysis using many more samples to try to clarify the above possibilities regarding the MM-1 gene. FISH analysis showed that the MM-1 gene is located at chromosome 12q12â12q13. A search of the data base of the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project of NCBI revealed that this region has been reported to be a hot spot of chromosome abnormalities in cancer cells, including inversion, translocation, and deletion in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, liposarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, lipoma, clear cell sarcoma, germ cell tumor, acute myeloid leukemia, or adenocarcinoma.MM-1, a protein associated with c-Myc at myc box II in the transactivation domain, repressed the E-box-dependent transcriptional activity of c-Myc (18Mori K.

The cell growth was arrested when the expression vector for MM-1 was introduced. MM-1 was thus thought to be a tumor suppressor that might suppress tumor progression by c-Myc via control of the transcriptional activity of c-Myc. Moreover, these activities of MM-1 as a tumor suppressor were abrogated by a point mutation at amino acid 157 of MM-1 from Ala to Arg, frequently found in cells of leukemia, lymphoma, and carcinoma of the tongue. Cells may have more chances to be transformed when MM-1 carries an A157R-like mutation and has lost its tumor suppressing activity.

https://openalex.org/W2017100422,"Lys114 of the plasma coagulation proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin, has been implicated in binding of the glycosaminoglycan activator, heparin, by previous mutagenesis studies and by the crystal structure of antithrombin in complex with the active pentasaccharide unit of heparin. In the present work, substitution of Lys114 by Ala or Met was shown to decrease the affinity of antithrombin for heparin and the pentasaccharide by â¼105-fold at I 0.15, corresponding to a reduction in binding energy of â¼50%. The decrease in affinity was due to the loss of two to three ionic interactions, consistent with Lys114 and at least one other basic residue of the inhibitor binding cooperatively to heparin, as well as to substantial nonionic interactions. The mutation minimally affected the initial, weak binding of the two-step mechanism of pentasaccharide binding to antithrombin but appreciably (>40-fold) decreased the forward rate constant of the conformational change in the second step and greatly (>1000-fold) increased the reverse rate constant of this step. Lys114 is thus of greater importance for the affinity of heparin binding than any of the other antithrombin residues investigated so far, viz. Arg47, Lys125, and Arg129. It contributes more than Arg47 and Arg129 to increasing the rate of induction of the activating conformational change, a role presumably exerted by interactions with the nonreducing end trisaccharide unit of the heparin pentasaccharide. However, its major effect, also larger than that of these two residues, is in maintaining antithrombin in the activated state by interactions that most likely involve the reducing end disaccharide unit.

N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine The plasma proteinase inhibitor of the serpin family, antithrombin, is a major regulator of blood clotting. Its crucial role is evident from many observations that individuals with heterozygous antithrombin deficiency, resulting in lower amounts of active inhibitor, have an increased tendency to develop thrombosis (1Van Boven H.H. Lane D.A. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 188-204PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of the gene in mice leads to embryonic lethality, due to fibrin deposition in myocardium and liver and consumptive coagulopathy (2Ishiguro K. Kojima T. Kadomatsu K. Nakayama Y.

Antithrombin inhibits most coagulation proteinases, although its main physiological targets are thrombin and factor Xa (1Van Boven H.H. Lane D.A. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 188-204PubMed Google Scholar,3Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function, and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996: 15-109Google Scholar, 4BjoÌrk I.

Like all inhibitorily active serpins, antithrombin inactivates target proteinases by a unique mechanism. The proteinase initially recognizes a reactive bond, located in a surface-exposed loop of the serpin, and proceeds to cleave this bond. At the acyl-intermediate stage of this cleavage, the reactive bond loop is opened, which releases the strain on the loop. As a consequence, the liberated N-terminal part of the loop is rapidly inserted into a major Î²-sheet of the inhibitor, the A sheet. The proteinase is still attached to this segment by an acyl bond and is therefore transported to the opposite pole of the protein. In this location, the proteinase is squeezed against the main body of the inhibitor and is inactivated by the resulting distortion of a large part of its structure, including the active site (3Gettins P.G.W.

In contrast to most serpins, which rapidly inhibit their target proteinases, antithrombin inactivates thrombin and factor Xa at only moderate rates. However, these reactions are greatly accelerated by the sulfated glycosaminoglycan, heparin, which thereby acts as an efficient anticoagulant (3Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function, and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996: 15-109Google Scholar, 4BjoÌrk I. Olson S.T. Church F.C. Cunningham D.D. Ginsburg D. Hoffman M. Stone S.R. Tollefsen D.M. Chemistry and Biology of Serpins. Plenum Press, New York1997: 17-33Google Scholar). The rate acceleration is due to a specific pentasaccharide region of heparin binding to antithrombin (8Thunberg L.

This binding occurs by a two-step mechanism, in which an initial, weak complex is formed in a rapid equilibrium in the first step. A conformational change that tightens the binding of the pentasaccharide region and activates the inhibitor is then induced in the second step (10Olson S.T. Srinivasan K.R. BjoÌrk I. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11073-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Olson S.T. BjoÌrk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conformational change is sufficient to accelerate the inhibition of factor Xa, whereas rapid thrombin inhibition is mainly dependent on approximation of enzyme and inhibitor by both binding to the same pentasaccharide-containing heparin chain of at least 18 saccharide units (3Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function, and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996: 15-109Google Scholar, 4BjoÌrk I. Olson S.T. Church F.C. Cunningham D.D. Ginsburg D. Hoffman M. Stone S.R. Tollefsen D.M. Chemistry and Biology of Serpins. Plenum Press, New York1997: 17-33Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of a complex between antithrombin and a synthetic heparin pentasaccharide (12Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) indicates that the increased heparin affinity induced in the second binding step involves the D helix of the inhibitor being elongated by 1.5 turns and a new, short Î±-helix, the P helix, being formed (Fig. 1). Moreover, the enhanced reactivity of antithrombin with factor Xa caused by heparin is most likely due to an increased exposure of the reactive bond loop. The x-ray structure has also identified several basic residues of antithrombin, predominantly Arg47, Lys114, Lys125, and Arg129, that participate in the binding by interacting with negative groups of the pentasaccharide (Fig. 1). The importance of Arg47 and Arg129 for the binding is consistent with the reduced heparin affinities of natural antithrombin variants in which these residues are altered (13Koide T. Odani S. Takahashi K. Ono T. Sakuragawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Gandrille S. Aiach M. Lane D.A. Vidaud D. Molho-Sabatier P.

The roles of the four residues have been further investigated by mutations in recombinant variants of the inhibitor (15Fan B. Turko I.V. Gettins P.G.W.

Substitution of Arg47, Lys125, and Arg129 led to 20â30-, 30â150-, and 400â2500-fold, respectively, losses of affinity for pentasaccharide and full-length heparin (15Fan B. Turko I.V.

Kinetic studies showed that both Arg47 and Arg129 are involved in the second step of heparin binding (19Arocas V. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. BjoÌrk I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10196-10204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Desai U. Swanson R. Bock S.C. BjoÌrk I. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18976-18984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), predominantly by decreasing the reverse rate constant of this step and thus aiding in keeping antithrombin in its activated form. In contrast, they only moderately contribute to increasing the rate of induction of the conformational change. Analogous studies of the role of Lys125 in the kinetics of heparin binding are lacking. Similarly, although mutation of Lys114 has demonstrated the importance of this residue for heparin binding (16Kridel S.J. Chan W.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Kridel S.J. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7656-7660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), its quantitative contribution to the binding and role in the binding kinetics are unknown. In this work, we have investigated the role of Lys114 in binding of heparin by mutation of this residue to Ala or Met. We find that these mutations decrease the affinity for pentasaccharide and full-length heparin by â¼105-fold, reflecting a considerably larger contribution to heparin binding of Lys114 than of the other residues investigated so far. Like Arg47 and Arg129, Lys114 does not participate to any appreciable extent in the first step of heparin binding but acts predominantly in the second step. However, it functions by both substantially increasing (>40-fold) the forward rate constant and greatly decreasing (>1000-fold) the reverse rate constant of this step. It is therefore of crucial importance both for induction of the heparin-induced conformational change that activates antithrombin and for locking the inhibitor in the conformationally activated state. Antithrombin variants with substitutions of Lys114 by Ala or Met were produced by site-directed mutagenesis with the previously characterized N135A variant as base molecule and were expressed in a baculovirus system (18Ersdal-Badju E.

The K114A/N135A mutant used in the present work has the correct sequence and is not the âK114A/N135Aâ of Ref. 18Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A.Q. Zuo Y.C. Picard V. Bock S.C. J. Biol.

The N135A, K114A/N135A, and K114M/N135A variants were purified by affinity chromatography on a 5-ml HiTrap Heparin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column at pH 7.4, as detailed in earlier work (18Ersdal-Badju E.

However, to bind the K114A/N135A and K114M/N135A variants to the immobilized heparin, it was necessary to reduce the ionic strength of the filtered lysates by dilution with one-half volume of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 Î¼m EDTA, pH 7.4, prior to loading of the columns. These variants were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluted with a 30-ml gradient from 0.02 to 0.6m NaCl in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4. A Lys114 to Met antithrombin variant was also produced by site-directed mutagenesis with an N135Q variant as base molecule and was expressed in a baby hamster kidney cell system (23Gettins P.G.W.

The N135Q and K114M/N135Q variants were purified by affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose, followed by successive chromatographies on DEAE-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (25Olson S.T. BjoÌrk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The purity of the antithrombin preparations was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the Tricine1 or Laemmli buffer systems (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar, 27SchaÌgger H. von Jagow G.

Concentrations of the three variants were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm with the use of the molar absorption coefficient of plasma antithrombin, 37,700 mâ1 cmâ1(28Nordenman B.

Full-length heparin with high affinity for antithrombin was isolated as described previously (11Olson S.T. BjoÌrk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol.

All experiments were carried out at 25.0 Â± 0.2 Â°C. The buffer in most experiments was 20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 Î¼m EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, adjusted to pH 6.0 or 7.4. The ionic strength of this buffer is 0.025 and 0.05 at the two pH values, respectively, and NaCl was added if higher ionic strengths were desired. However, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 100 Î¼m EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 was used for measurements at I0.025, pH 7.4. Stoichiometries and dissociation equilibrium constants for the binding of the different heparin forms to the antithrombin variants were measured by titrations monitored by the enhancement of intrinsic protein fluorescence accompanying the interaction, as described previously (19Arocas V. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. BjoÌrk I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10196-10204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Desai U. Swanson R. Bock S.C. BjoÌrk I. Olson S.T. J. Biol.

Stoichiometries of full-length heparin binding to the N135A and N135Q variants were measured at I 0.15, pH 7.4, with antithrombin concentrations of 0.1â0.3 Î¼m. Stoichiometries of pentasaccharide or full-length heparin binding to the K114A/N135A, K114M/N135A, and K114M/N135Q variants were determined at I 0.025, pH 6.0, and 1â2 Î¼m antithrombin. Affinities of trisaccharide, pentasaccharide, or full-length heparin binding to the variants were determined at pH 6.0 or 7.4 and different ionic strengths with antithrombin concentrations of 50â500 nm. The data were fitted to the equilibrium binding equation by nonlinear least-squares analysis (25Olson S.T. BjoÌrk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The kinetics of binding of pentasaccharide or full-length heparin to the N135A and K114A/N135A antithrombin variants were analyzed under pseudo-first order conditions by monitoring the increase in protein fluorescence in an SX-17MV stopped-flow instrument (Applied Biophysics, Leatherhead, United Kingdom) as in earlier work (11Olson S.T.

Experiments with both saccharides were done at I 0.075, although at pH 6.0 for the pentasaccharide and at pH 7.4 for full-length heparin. Saccharide concentrations varied between 0.2 and 13 Î¼m and were at least 10-fold higher than antithrombin concentrations. Progress curves were fitted to a single exponential function to give the observed pseudo-first order rate constant, kobs. Four traces were averaged for each rate constant determination, and reported kobs values are averages of at least four such determinations. Stoichiometries of inhibition of active site-titrated human Î±-thrombin by the antithrombin variants in the absence of heparin were measured essentially as detailed previously (19Arocas V. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. BjoÌrk I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10196-10204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Desai U. Swanson R. Bock S.C. BjoÌrk I. Olson S.T. J. Biol.

Briefly, a series of samples of thrombin at a constant concentration of 0.1 or 0.5 Î¼m was incubated with increasing amounts of antithrombin variant in I 0.15, pH 7.4 buffer. The residual activity of the enzyme was then determined after 16 h (for 0.1 Î¼m thrombin) or 1â2 h (for 0.5 Î¼m thrombin) from the initial rate of hydrolysis of the substrate, S-2238 (d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide; Chromogenix, MoÌlndal, Sweden). Stoichiometries of thrombin inhibition by the N135A, K114A/N135A, N135Q, and K114M/N135Q variants in the presence of heparin at I 0.05, pH 7.4, were measured by incubating 20 nm thrombin with increasing concentrations of antithrombin variant and 25 nm full-length heparin for 1 h and assaying the residual enzyme activity in the same manner. The inhibition stoichiometries were obtained from linear least-squares fits of plots of residual enzyme activity versus the molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme (25Olson S.T. BjoÌrk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Second order rate constants for inhibition of human Î±-thrombin or factor Xa by the N135A, K114A/N135A, N135Q, and K114M/N135Q variants in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide or full-length heparin were measured under pseudo-first order conditions, essentially as in earlier work (11Olson S.T.

Uncatalyzed reactions with thrombin and factor Xa were analyzed at I 0.15 and 0.05, pH 7.4, and such reactions with factor Xa were also studied at I 0.025, pH 6.0. The rates of the pentasaccharide-catalyzed and full-length heparin-catalyzed reactions of the variants with the two proteinases were only measured at I 0.025, pH 6.0, and I0.05, pH 7.4, respectively. Reaction mixtures contained 100â2000 nm antithrombin and 5â10 nm proteinase, with or without 0.1â700 nm pentasaccharide or full-length heparin. The concentration of the saccharides was in most cases â¤10% of the antithrombin concentration. However, in the analyses of the pentasaccharide-catalyzed thrombin inhibition by the N135A and K114A/N135A variants, the pentasaccharide concentration approached and exceeded the antithrombin concentration, due to the small accelerating effect. After different reaction times, aliquots were diluted 10-fold in I 0.15, pH 7.4 buffer, containing 100 Î¼mS-2238 for thrombin or Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) for factor Xa, and the residual proteinase activity was determined. Observed pseudo-first order rate constants,kobs, were obtained by fitting the decrease of this activity with time to a single exponential decay function with an end point of zero activity (25Olson S.T. BjoÌrk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Second order rate constants for uncatalyzed reactions were obtained by dividing kobs with the antithrombin concentration. Most such rate constants for pentasaccharide- or full-length heparin-catalyzed reactions were derived from the least-squares slope of the linear dependence of kobs on the concentration of the antithrombin-saccharide complex, calculated from measured dissociation constants (11Olson S.T.

Alternatively, the rate constants for some catalyzed reactions were calculated from kobs measured at a single saccharide concentration by first subtracting kobs for the uncatalyzed reaction and then dividing by the calculated concentration of the antithrombin-saccharide complex (22Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. BjoÌrk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Desai U.R. Petitou M. BjoÌrk I. Olson S.T. J. Biol.

Uncatalyzed rate constants for thrombin inhibition by the N135A and K114A/N135A variants at I 0.025, pH 6.0, and I 0.05, pH 7.4, were obtained from the intercepts on the ordinate of the plots of kobs versusthe concentration of the antithrombin-heparin complex from which also the heparin-catalyzed rate constants were derived. K114A and K114M antithrombin variants were expressed on an N135A background in a baculovirus system, as in our previous studies of the roles of Arg47 and Arg129 of the inhibitor in heparin binding (19Arocas V.

In addition, a K114M variant was expressed on an N135Q background in a baby hamster kidney cell system. The N135A or N135Q substitutions produce antithrombin forms, corresponding to Î²-antithrombin in plasma, which have high heparin affinity due to the absence of an oligosaccharide side chain on Asn135 (21Ersdal-Badju E.

https://openalex.org/W2042565773,"Structural prediction of several bacterial and plant ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases, as well as of other sugar-nucleotide pyrophosphorylases, was used for comparison with the three-dimensional structures of two crystallized pyrophosphorylases (Brown, K., Pompeo, F., Dixon, S., Mengin-Lecreulx, D., Cambillau, C., and Bourne, Y. (1999) EMBO J. 18, 4096â4107; Blankenfeldt, W., Asuncion, M., Lam, J. S., and Naismith, J. H. (2000)EMBO J. 19, 6652â6663). This comparison led to the discovery of highly conserved residues throughout the superfamily of pyrophosphorylases despite the low overall homology. One of those residues, Asp142 in the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase fromEscherichia coli, was predicted to be near the substrate site. To elucidate the function that Asp142 might play in the E. coli ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, aspartate was replaced by alanine, asparagine, or glutamate using site-directed mutagenesis. Kinetic analysis in the direction of synthesis or pyrophosphorolysis of the purified mutants showed a decrease in specific activity of up to 4 orders of magnitude. Comparison of other kinetic parameters, i.e. the apparent affinities for substrates and allosteric effectors, showed no significant changes, excluding this residue from the specific role of ligand binding. Only the D142E mutant exhibited altered K m values but none as pronounced as the decrease in specific activity. These results show that residue Asp142 is important in the catalysis of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from E. coli.

The biosynthesis of these polysaccharides proceeds from the formation of the glucosyl donor, ADP-glucose (ADP-Glc).1 ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADP-Glc PPase, EC 2.7.7.27) catalyzes the synthesis of ADP-Glc and pyrophosphate (PPi) from ATP and glucose 1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) (1Espada J.

This reversible reaction is the key regulatory step in the production of glycogen in bacteria and starch in plants (2Preiss J. Annu. Rev.

Most of the enzymes are allosterically regulated by the glycolytic intermediates of the major pathway of carbon assimilation in the organism (6Preiss J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1973: 73-119Google Scholar). The regulatory effectors include the activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and the inhibitor AMP for an enzyme from enteric bacteria, e.g. Escherichia coli (7Preiss J. Shen L. Greenberg E. Gentner N. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1833-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the activator 3-phosphoglycerate and the inhibitor inorganic phosphate for enzymes from plants and other photosynthetic organisms,e.g. algae and cyanobacteria (4Ghosh H.P.

Active ADP-Glc PPase forms a tetramer of about 200 kDa, which is either homomeric (Î±4) in bacteria (8Ozaki H. Preiss J. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 406-413Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Haugen T.H. Ishaque A. Preiss J. J. Biol.

The emergence of two different subunits in plants, designated as small and large based on disparities in molecular weight, likely arose from the need for tissue-specific regulation (5Sivak M.N. Preiss J. Adv. Food Nutr. Res. 1998; 41: 1-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Krishnan H.B. Reeves C.D. Okita T.W. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 642-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, other studies show that each subunit has a separate function: the small subunit is catalytic while the large subunit is a mediator of the allosteric regulation of the small subunit (13Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure of an ADP-Glc PPase has not yet been resolved by x-ray crystallography; however, many structural studies have been performed using other approaches. A combination of techniques, such as chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis, has been applied to study the ADP-Glc PPase enzyme fromE. coli. Azido-based photoaffinity analogs of the ATP substrate and the ADP-Glc substrate (pyrophosphorolysis direction) were used to probe the substrate-binding site. Analysis of the covalently labeled enzyme revealed Tyr114 as the modified residue, and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis of the residue showed a marked decrease in affinity for ATP, as well as a decrease in affinity for Glc-1-P and FBP (14Kumar A. Tanaka T. Lee Y.M. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14634-14639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The residue likely interacts with the adenine ring of ATP but is not crucial for the binding of the substrate. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate, a mild reagent that modifies lysines within ligand-binding sites upon reduction by NaBH4, is an analog of the activator from E. coli, FBP. Reaction of this modifying agent with the enzyme labels two different lysines, Lys39 and Lys195 that are blocked by the inclusion of FBP and of the substrate ADP-Glc, respectively (15Parsons T.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6197-6202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Parsons T.F. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7638-7645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of Lys39 showed that this residue is important in the interaction of the activator FBP with the enzyme (17Gardiol A. Preiss J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the Lys195 residue produced enzymes with drastically increased K m values for Glc-1-P, while the other kinetic constants and the k cat were not altered, showing clearly that this residue is involved in the binding of Glc-1-P in both bacterial and plant enzymes (18Hill M.A. Kaufmann K. Otero J. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12455-12460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).These techniques have also been used to probe the regulatory sites of ADP-Glc PPases from photosynthetic organisms. Studies of pyridoxal-5-phosphate-modified residues in the ADP-Glc PPases from spinach leaves and the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC 7120 have implicated specific lysine residues located in the C terminus that are involved in the binding of the activator 3-phosphoglycerate (20Morell M. Bloom M. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 633-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ball K. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24706-24711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Charng Y.Y. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24107-24113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are not present in the bacterial enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis of these homologous residues in ADP-Glc PPase fromAnabaena and from the heterotetrameric enzyme from potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber specifically affects the apparent affinity for activator (22Charng Y.Y. Iglesias A.A. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24107-24113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ballicora M.A. Fu Y. Nesbitt N.M. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The results from the above structural studies show that functionally important residues located in the active site are conserved in ADP-Glc PPases from different organisms; however, the residues related to the regulation of these enzymes seem to have diverged.Protein sequence alignments of ADP-Glc PPases show a high degree of conservation (85â95% similarity) among enzymes from bacteria and among the small subunits of plants; however, the similarity between the two groups is about half (30â40%) (24Smith-White B.J. Preiss J. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the large subunits from plants in the alignment with the small subunits improves the percent similarity slightly (50â60%) from the comparison between bacteria and the small subunits. The degree of similarity can be increased for enzymes from bacteria and the small and large subunits when limiting the comparison to the region containing roughly the first 200 residues (Fig. 1). Within this region, many residues are highly conserved among the various ADP-Glc PPases. Moreover, the region contains at least a few key residues conserved throughout other enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of a nucleoside diphosphate sugar from a sugar-phosphate and a nucleoside triphosphate (19Fu Y. Ballicora M.A. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although these enzymes have been characterized thoroughly by the above methods, a residue involved in the catalytic reaction has not been isolated. The three-dimensional structure of an ADP-Glc PPase will likely be of help in this endeavor, and work on the crystallography is in progress. In the meantime, a prediction of the structure of ADP-Glc PPase is needed to interpret the relationship between the available genetic and biochemical data and the structure of the enzyme, and to possibly identify putative residues involved in catalysis.In the current study, we present the secondary structure predictions and alignments of several ADP-Glucose PPases by the methods of PHD and a modified âhydrophobic cluster analysis.â These predictions were compared with the solved three-dimensional structures of other enzymes, dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (RmlA (25Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)) andN-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU (26Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)), that catalyze the synthesis of a nucleoside diphosphate sugar. Although sequence homology of these enzymes is low in comparison to the ADP-Glc PPases, we found a definite conservation of secondary structure. Asp142 in E. coli is absolutely conserved throughout these sugar-nucleotide pyrophosphorylases and is located in a predicted loop. This same loop in RmlA and GlmU is located in the catalytic sites of these proteins. This Asp142residue was mutated to an Ala, Asn, and Glu, and the mutant enzymes showed a substantial decrease in V max, with only the Glu mutant demonstrating some variation in theK m of the substrates and effectors. This study shows for the first time a residue from an ADP-Glc PPase that is involved in the catalysis of the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[32P]PPi was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [14C]Glucose-1-P was obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. Glc-1-P, ATP, ADP-Glc, FBP, AMP, and inorganic pyrophosphatase were purchased from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by the Macromolecular Facility at Michigan State University. BL21(DE3) cells and PerfectTMprotein markers were obtained from Novagen, Inc. The Mono Q HR 10/10 column was acquired from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Construction of Plasmids and Site-directed MutagenesisThe pETEC plasmid was used for site-directed mutagenesis and expression of the E. coli wild-type and D142E mutant. It is a derivative of pET-24a (Novagen) into which the coding region of theE. coli ADP-Glc PPase was subcloned after polymerase chain reaction amplification from the plasmid pOP12 (27Okita T.W. Rodriguez R.L. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6944-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pMAB3 plasmid was utilized for expression of the D142A and D142N mutants. pMAB3 is a derivative of pMLaugh10 where the coding regions of the mutants were exchanged from the pETEC vector, after mutagenesis, using the restriction sites XbaI and SacI. As a control plasmid, pMAB5 was used, which is a derivative of pMLaugh10 that has no insert.Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the method of the Combined Chain Reaction (28Bi W. Stambrook P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pETEC plasmid was used as a template, and the following oligonucleotides were utilized to introduce the mutations at position 142: Asn (D142N) 5â²-CTGGCGGGC AAC CATATCTAC-3â²; Ala (D142A) 5â²-CTGGCGGGC GCG CATATCTAC-3â²; Glu (D142E) 5â²-CTGGCGGGC GAA CATATCTAC-3â². The coding regions of the mutated plasmids were sequenced by automated dideoxy sequencing, at the Michigan State University Sequencing Facility, to confirm that no random mutations were introduced.Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant EnzymesThe wild-type and D142E plasmids were expressed in the E. coli bacterial strain BL21(DE3). A single colony of transformed cells was grown in Luria broth (1 liter) at 37 Â°C up to anA 600 of 0.6. Induction was initiated by the addition of isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactoside (1 mm final concentration), with subsequent incubation at 25 Â°C for 4 h. The cells were then harvested and resuspended instorage buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA (about 5 ml of buffer/g of cells). All subsequent protein purification steps were conducted at 0â4 Â°C. The resuspensions were sonicated for three 30-s intervals with cooling on ice between sonications. The sonicated suspensions were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 Ã g, and the supernatants were retained. An ammonium sulfate cut (30â60%) of the supernatants was performed, with centrifugation of the cut samples for 20 min at 20,000 Ã g. The 30â60% ammonium sulfate pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of storage buffer and desalted on Bio-Rad 10 DG chromatography columns equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA). The desalted samples were applied individually to a Mono Q HR 10/10 column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A, and the samples were eluted with a linear KCl gradient (160 ml, 0â0.5 m) in buffer A. Fractions of 4 ml were collected and those containing activity were desalted in buffer A minus the 10% sucrose.The D142N and D142A mutant plasmids were expressed in E. coli bacterial strain AC70R1-504, which is deficient in endogenous ADP-Glc PPase activity. Transformed cells (1 liter) were induced as described for the plasmid pMLaugh10 (13Ballicora M.A. Laughlin M.J. Fu Y. Okita T.W. Barry G.F. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes were purified as above.The specific activity in the crude extracts of the wild type, D142N, D142E, and D142A enzymes were 45, 0.009, 0.5, and 0.01 units/mg, respectively. The enzymes remained stable during the purification, and the total yield was 24, 36, 37, and 21%. Since the proteins were overexpressed, to reach homogeneity (a single band stained with Coomassie Blue after 2 Î¼g were run in a SDS-PAGE) it was necessary to purify them only 4.6-, 3.3-, 5.4-, and 4-fold, respectively.Enzyme AssayAssay A: PyrophosphorolysisFormation of [32P]ATP from [32P]PPi in the direction of pyrophosphorolysis at 37 Â°C was determined by the method of Shen and Preiss (29Shen L. Preiss J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 17: 424-429Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 80 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 7 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm [32P]PPi (1500â2500 cpm/nmol), 2 mm ADP-Glc, 1 mm FBP, 4 mm NaF, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, plus enzyme in a total volume of 250 Î¼l. The reaction mixtures for the D142E mutant were similar, except they contained 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm [32P]PPi, and 3 mm FBP to compensate for increasedK m values.Assay B: SynthesisFormation of [14C]ADP-glucose from [14C]Glc-1-P in the synthesis direction at 37 Â°C was determined by the method of Preisset al. (7Preiss J. Shen L. Greenberg E. Gentner N. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1833-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures consisted of 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm [14C]Glc-1-P (â¼1000 cpm/nmol), 1 mm ATP, 2 mm FBP, 0.0015 units/Î¼l pyrophosphatase, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, plus enzyme in a total volume of 200 Î¼l. The reaction mixtures for the D142E mutant were similar, except they contained 12 mmMgCl2, 3 mm [14C]Glc-1-P (â¼300 cpm/nmol), 6 mm ATP, and 3 mm FBP. When measuring the kinetic value of the inhibitor, AMP, for the wild-type and D142A and D142N mutants, 1.5 mm FBP was present in the assay mixture. The FBP concentration in the same inhibitor assay mixture was increased to 3 mm for the D142E mutant. One unit of enzyme activity in the above assays is equal to 1 Î¼mol of product, either [32P]ATP or [14C]ADP-glucose, formed per minute at 37 Â°C.Kinetic CharacterizationThe kinetic data were plotted as initial velocity (nmol/min)versus substrate or effector concentration (mm). The kinetic constants were acquired by fitting the data with a nonlinear least square formula and the Hill equation using the program OriginTM 5.0. The Hill coefficient,n H, and the kinetic constants, S0.5,A 0.5, and I0.5, which correspond to the concentration of substrate, activator, or inhibitor giving 50% of the maximal velocity, activation, or inhibition, respectively, were calculated from the Hill plots.Protein AssayProtein concentration during enzyme purification was measured by using bicinchoninic acid reagent (30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18445) Google Scholar) from Pierce Chemical Co., with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein concentration of the purified enzymes was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.0.Protein Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingProtein purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar), utilizing 4â15% Tris-HCl pre-cast gradient polyacrylamide gels from Bio-Rad. PerfectTM protein markers were used for molecular weight standards. Following electrophoresis, protein bands were either visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or electroblotted onto a ProtranTM(Schleicher & Schuell) nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was subsequently treated with affinity purified anti-E. coli B strain AC70R1 ADP-Glc PPase IgG (9Haugen T.H. Ishaque A. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7880-7885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting antigen-antibody complex was visualized by treatment with alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG, then staining with BM purple AP-substrate precipitating reagent from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.Stability of the Enzymes to HeatAn aliquot, 15 Î¼g, of the purified enzymes was diluted (1:2) in a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing the following enyzme dilution buffer: 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (total volume: 30 Î¼l). The heat treatment was performed at 55 Â°C for 5 min with subsequent cooling on ice. Aliquots were then removed to measure the activity using assay B. A control without heat treatment was analyzed in parallel for comparison (100% activity).Structure Prediction AnalysisThe amino acid sequence of the ADP-Glc PPases was analyzed by a profile neural network program (PHD program (32Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar)) to predict the secondary structure and the probability for the residues to be exposed. Sequences were aligned manually based on the primary and predicted secondary structure. A modified two-step method of hydrophobic cluster analysis was used to enhance the alignment (33Lemesle-Varloot L. Henrissat B. Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Morgat A. Mornon J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 555-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The original method plotted clusters of amino acids as an Î±-helix, and the hydrophobic ones were highlighted and encircled to signal the presence of a hydrophobic cluster. In our method, we encircled clusters of residues predicted as âburiedâ by the PHD program. To expedite this process, we developed a program in Pascal language. 2J. B. Frueauf, M. A. Ballicora, and J. Preiss, unpublished results. This modified method of hydrophobic cluster analysis proved to be more accurate in finding similar clusters in these homologous proteins.DISCUSSIONThe three-dimensional structure of an enzyme is a valuable tool for analyzing the residues located in the ligand-binding sites and for studying the structure-function relationships and the evolution of homologous domains in enzymes. Unfortunately, no structure of any ADP-Glc PPase has been solved yet. Two enzymes that share a similar catalytic reaction with the ADP-Glc PPase have been crystallized, and their structures have been solved (RmlA and GlmU). However, the homology with ADP-Glc PPase is very low and computer modeling is not possible. To study the structure-function relationship of a putative catalytic domain of the ADP-Glc PPase from E. coli, we made a prediction of the secondary structure, and the helices, loops, and sheets were matched with the structures of RmlA and GlmU. The prediction was extremely similar to these proteins, enhancing the significance of highly conserved residues that were isolated. These residues were found to be in key regions of particular motifs (Fig. 1). Interestingly, structures usually observed in proteins that bind nucleotides were found to be compatible with the prediction. Region 1 (Fig. 1) has a glycine-rich loop after a Î²-sheet that is similar to the âP loopâ in protein kinases or nucleotide-binding sites (36Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar), and region 2 has three predicted Î²-sheets and helices that are compatible with the Rossman fold (37Rossman M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Thus, regions 1 and 2 comprise a putative domain or subdomain that binds ATP. Moreover, Tyr114, which was shown to be reactive to the azido analog of ATP (38Lee Y.M. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1058-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lee Y.M. Mukherjee S. Preiss J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), is in this region. These predictions are in excellent agreement with the three-dimensional structures of the RmlA and GlmU enzymes.The secondary structure of the predicted model is extremely similar to the secondary structure of RmlA and of the pyrophosphorylase domain of the bifunctional enzyme from GlmU. Regions 2, 3, and 4 are virtually identical. In region 4, the only difference is that two Î²-sheets were predicted rather than one because of the presence of Gly214(breaker, Fig. 1). In GlmU, this is only one Î²-sheet, which is bent because of a glycine and is part of the substrate site where the sugar-phosphate rests. Possibly, this motif is typical of the pyrophosphorylase family. The only area that the predicted secondary structures of other pyrophosphorylases, such as GDP-Man PPases, CDP-Glc PPases, and UDP-Glc PPases, did not match was the last 10 residues of region 1 and the first 10 residues of region 2 (data not shown).There are other loops in the structures of GlmU and RmlA that face their respective substrates. In the prediction of the structure of the ADP-Glc PPases we found that there are highly conserved residues in these homologous loops (Fig. 1). Some of them have already been assigned a function. For instance Lys195, the Glc-1-P-binding site in ADP-Glc PPases, is present in the third loop of region 3 and interacts with the sugar-phosphate in both RmlA and GlmU. The homologous lysine is present in RmlA and in GlmU but shifted one position in the latter. The fourth loop in region 2 (Fig. 1) has residues that are conserved in the ADP-Glc PPases and that interact with the dTTP or UTP in RmlA and GlmU, respectively. It contains Tyr114, which has been proposed to be close to the ATP-binding site. Also, the last residue of this loop is Gly116 which is part of the motif âGTADâ that is highly conserved in ADP-Glc PPases. Most probably the function of this loop is to confer the specificity for the nucleotide since these residues interact with the base. Asp142 in ADP-Glc PPase fromE. coli is another one of these highly conserved residues that is located in a loop predicted to be near the substrates by comparison with RmlA and GlmU. In this study the function of this residue was analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. Replacement of Asp142 resulted in a significant decrease in catalysis in either direction of product formation. This effect on catalysis was reduced by conserving the negative charge (Tables I and II), indicating that the charge of this residue plays an important role in the catalytic reaction. This is the first time that a residue involved in the catalysis of an ADP-Glc PPase enzyme has been characterized. Although the activity of the D142N and D142A mutants was reduced by 4 orders of magnitude, we were still able to obtain data on the other kinetic parameters of these mutant enzymes. Measuring the effect of mutations on catalytic residues can be limiting when the activity of the mutant enzyme(s) falls below the sensitivity of the assay. Blankenfeldt et al. (25Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) mutated the corresponding Asp residue in RmlA based on their determination of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme and their results show a decrease in catalytic activity of at least 3 orders of magnitude for the mutated enzymes. However, they were not able to measure any other kinetic parameters, providing them with only partial information about this residue in RmlA. In this study, the kinetic parameters for the substrates and allosteric effectors were not altered very much for the D142A and D142N mutants, indicating that the main function of Asp142 is not related to their binding.Even though mutation of Asp142 most significantly affected the catalysis of ADP-Glc PPase from E. coli, to a lesser extent the mutation affected the regulation of the D142E and D142N mutants (Table I). As discussed above, the A 0.5for FBP of D142E increased 17-fold and the I0.5 for AMP of D142N increased 25-fold over wild-type. These changes can be attributed to a suboptimal interaction between the regulatory and the catalytic sites through a disruption of the local environment surrounding Asp142. The mutation of Asp142 to Glu does not alter the charge. However, there is an extra methylene in Glu which probably interferes with the normal interaction of this negatively charged residue with those residues that might be important for regulation. In fact, the activator of ADP-Glc PPase from E. coli interacts with Lys39, which was predicted to be in a loop by the PHD program (Fig. 1). This loop is predicted to be near Asp142"

Levels of NQO1 activity were much higher (40-fold) in confluent HeLa cells than in sparse cells, the former cells being much more resistant to H2O2. Addition of sublethal concentrations of H2O2 (up to 24 Î¼m) produced a significant increase of NQO1 (up to 16-fold at 12 Î¼m) in sparse cells but had no effect in confluent cells. When cells reached confluency in the presence of pyruvate, a H2O2 scavenger, NQO1 activity was decreased compared with cultures grown to confluency without pyruvate. Inhibition of quinone reductases by dicumarol substantially decreased viability of confluent cells in serum-free medium. This is the first demonstration that regulation of NQO1 expression by H2O2 is dependent on the cell density in HeLa cells and that endogenous generation of H2O2participates in the increase of NQO1 activity as cell density is higher.

Fed. Proc. 1958; 17: 216Google Scholar, 2Ernster L. Navazio F. Acta Chem. Scand. 1958; 12: 595-602Crossref Google Scholar) is a cytosolic flavoenzyme widely distributed and ubiquitously present in all the tissues of nearly all animal species (3Siegel D. Ross D. Free Radic.

Among the various cytosolic NAD(P)H:(quinone acceptor) oxidoreductases described so far, the isoform 1 (NQO1)1 is the best studied enzyme (4Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Several properties of NQO1 make it an unique flavoenzyme (5Cadenas E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These include its nonspecific reactivity toward pyridine nucleotides substrates (NADH or NADPH) and broad electron acceptor specificity, its extreme sensitivity to inhibition by the anticoagulant dicumarol (6Lind C. Cadenas E. Hochstein P. Ernster L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and its obligatory two-electron reaction mechanism, which results in a direct hydride transfer to a variety of quinone substrates to give their corresponding hydroquinones (7Li R.

NQO1 is generally regarded as a protective enzyme that has been shown to prevent the formation of highly reactive quinone metabolites, detoxify benzo(a)pyrene quinone, and reduce chromium (VI) toxicity (4Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar,9Long II, D.J. Waikel R.L. Wang X.J. Perlaky L. Roop D.R. Jaiswal A.K.

Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), thereby promoting their antioxidant function in membranes. On the other hand, metabolism of a number of quinones by NQO1 (and other related reductases as well) produce unstable hydroquinones that can be readily autoxidized to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and can rearrange into bioalkylating compounds causing further damage to the cells (5Cadenas E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar,15Phillips R.M. Burger A.M. Loadman P.M. Jarrett C.M. Swaine D.J. Fiebig H.H.

Thus, the actual antioxidant or prooxidant role of NQO1 in the cell depends upon the chemical nature and reactivity of the particular hydroquinone generated in the reactions it catalyzes (5Cadenas E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 17Siemankowski L.M. Morreale J. Butts B.D. Briehl M.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3638-3644PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, this enzyme has received a renewed interest because of the demonstration of novel roles for NQO1, which include the regulation of the intracellular redox state by controlling the NAD(P)H:NAD(P)+ ratio (18Gaikwad A. Long D.J. Stringer J.L. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22559-22564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-Î± and p53-mediated apoptotic cell death, most likely through to its ability to control the intracellular redox environment (17Siemankowski L.M.

A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Published papers have documented changes in NQO1 expression with relation to the growth phase in cultured cells. In this way, an increase in NQO1 activity has been reported to occur at high densities in normal BALB/c 3T3 cells, and the proposal was made that this increase could be also associated to density-dependent inhibition of growth (21Schlager J.J. Hoerl B.J. Riebow J. Scott D.P. Gasdaska P. Scott R.E. Powis G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1338-1342PubMed Google Scholar). NQO1 expression and activity are also significantly elevated in confluent cell cultures and spheroids of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells (22Phillips R.M. de la Cruz A. Traver R.D. Gibson N.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3766-3771PubMed Google Scholar). Although the demonstration that expression of NQO1 is elevated in confluent cells and inside multicellular spheroids has important implications in the area of bioreductive drug metabolism (22Phillips R.M. de la Cruz A. Traver R.D. Gibson N.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3766-3771PubMed Google Scholar), environmental stimuli responsible for causing elevated NQO1 expression at high density have not been investigated. Furthermore, after the demonstration of NQO1 participation in the maintenance of intracellular redox balance controlling cell growth and apoptosis, the characterization of those factors involved in density-regulated expression of NQO1 may give new insights in the knowledge of the factors that regulate cell growth. Expression of the NQO1 gene is positively or negatively regulated by a number of transcription factors (such as c-Jun, Jun-B, Jun-D, c-Fos, Fra1, Nrf1, and Nrf2) that bind to severalcis-elements of the NQO1 gene promoter, including an antioxidant response element that contains AP-1 and AP-1-like elements, a basal element, and AP-2 element (4Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 23Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). NQO1 expression is coordinately induced with other genes by 3-methylcholantrene, dioxin,trans-stilbene, phenobarbital, azo dyes, aromatic diamines, aminophenols, and phenolic antioxidants (4Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 24Li Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15097-15104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A common feature of all phenolic antioxidants that transcriptionally activate gene expression via the antioxidant response element sequence is their ability to undergo redox cycling to form superoxide radicals and H2O2, which have been recognized as secondary messengers (25Kayanoki Y.

Biochem. 1994; 226: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), this study was set to test the putative role of H2O2 in the regulation of NQO1 expression with relation to density of HeLa cell cultures. Our results have shown that NQO1 activity is considerably increased when HeLa cells reach high density, and this increase correlates with enhanced resistance of cells against H2O2. We report evidence that endogenous generation of H2O2 contributes to the rise of NQO1 activity, and this enzyme is required to maintain cell viability at high cellular densities. Cultures of HeLa cells were maintained at the laboratory in Dulbecco's MEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 mg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma) at 37 Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Prior to experiments using H2O2, the cells were changed to iron-free and pyruvate-free MEM (Sigma) (34Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). The culture medium was changed every 2 days until the cells reached the densities required for each experiment. The cells were grown to a density of about 8,000 viable cells/cm2 (low density, sparse) or 100,000 cells/cm2 (high density, confluent). In some experiments, 10 mm sodium pyruvate was added to the culture medium to study the effect of H2O2 scavenging (35Brand K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 36Brand K.A. Hermfisse U. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 37Li J.-J. Oberley L.W. Fan M.

Stock solutions of the NQO1 inhibitor dicumarol (2 mm) were prepared in 6 mm NaOH and added to cells to a final concentration of 20 Î¼m. The same amount of vehicle was added to controls. The viability of cells was estimated by the trypan blue exclusion assay after detaching cells from culture dishes using a nonenzymatic solution (Sigma). Proliferation was measured from the ability of cells to incorporate thymidine. Briefly, the cells were incubated with 0.25 Î¼Ci/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine for 8â24 h. After incubation, the culture plates were put on ice, and the cells were washed with cold 0.9% NaCl. Cold trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 5%, the supernatants were discarded, and the cells were then lysed with 0.1 n NaOH. Lysates were used for measuring incorporation of radioactivity using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Incorporation was referred to cell number to obtain specific values. All procedures were carried out at 4 Â°C. The cells were separated from culture dishes as described above, concentrated by centrifugation at 1,000 Ãg for 5 min, and washed with cold 130 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm PMSF. The cells were centrifuged again and resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and 20 Î¼g/Î¼l each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A). Homogenization of cells was carried out for 5 min with the aid of a glass-glass potter and then for 30 s with a mechanical cell homogenizer. After disruption of the cells, the concentration of the lysis buffer was raised to 100 mm Tris by adding enough volume of 250 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A. Unbroken cells and debris were separated by centrifugation at 800 Ã g for 5 min, and the supernatant was saved. Cytosolic fractions were separated from membranous material by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 Ã g for 30 min. NQO1 (DT-diaphorase) activity was measured in cytosolic fractions from the NADH and menadione-dependent dicumarol-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c (6Lind C. Cadenas E. Hochstein P. Ernster L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Assays were carried at 37 Â°C with constant gentle stirring. The assay mixture (1 ml) contained 70 Î¼g of cytosolic protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.08% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm NADH, 10 Î¼m menadione, and 77 Î¼m cytochrome c. Assays were carried out either in the absence or in the presence of 10 Î¼mdicumarol, and absorbance was recorded at 550 nm in a Beckman DU-640 UV-visible spectrophotometer. NQO1 activity was calculated from the difference in reaction rates obtained with and without dicumarol. An extinction coefficient of 18.5 mmâ1cmâ1 was used in calculations of specific activities (6Lind C. Cadenas E. Hochstein P. Ernster L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Protein determinations were carried out by the dye binding method described by Stoscheck (38Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 1,500 viable cells/cm2 on 50-cm2 culture dishes in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 3 days growing, viable cells reached a density of about 8,000/cm2 (sparse). The cells from separate plates were allowed to grow for an additional period of 3 days until they reached a density of about 100,000 viable cells/cm2 (confluent) (Fig.1 A). Sparse cells were in exponential phase of growth (Fig. 1), but the growth rate of confluent cells was significantly lower, as estimated from a substantial decrease in thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1 B). All cultures used in our experiments exhibited similar viabilities of about 87%. Growing HeLa cells to densities above 200,000 cells/cm2 resulted in a considerably decrease in viability (Fig. 1 A). Thus, reaching these cellular concentrations was avoided. Cytosolic fractions were obtained from sparse or confluent cells and used for assaying NQO1 activity. Very little NQO1 activity was detected in cytosols obtained from low density HeLa cells, but this activity showed a dramatic increase of up to 40-fold in confluent cultures (Fig.2). To study the kinetics of NQO1 increase with relation to cell density, cytosols were obtained from HeLa cells cultured to different cell densities ranging between 8,000 and 100,000 viable cells/cm2. As shown in Fig.3, a 10â15-fold increase in NQO1 activity was obtained in only 1 day of culture, with the density of cells increasing from about 8,000 to 15,000 cells/cm2. Thereafter, the stimulation of NQO1 continued until a maximal activation was achieved in confluent cultures (about 100,000 viable cells/cm2). It is noteworthy that a significant increase of NQO1 (10â15-fold) was observed well before cells reached confluence, and thus, different factors in addition to cell-to-cell contacts could account for the observed increment in NQO1 activity. A plausible interpretation is that some diffusible agent(s) could mediate the rise of NQO1 as the cell density increases.Figure 3Time course of NQO1 activity increase (A) and cell density (B). The cells were grown either under standard conditions in MEM containing 10% serum or in the same medium supplemented with 10 mmpyruvate. At the indicated times, the cells were detached from culture plates, and the number of viable cells was counted. Cytosolic fractions were obtained to measure NQO1 activity. Increase values in Awere referred to initial NQO1 activity at day three (sparse cells). The cell density was calculated as the number of viable cells/cm2. Closed symbols and bars, standard medium.

Gill V. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1993; 19: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Burdon R.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that H2O2 could be involved in the cell density-related rise of NQO1 activity. As a first step in addressing the putative role of H2O2 in density-regulated expression of NQO1, we checked the resistance of HeLa cells to addition of exogenous H2O2, both in sparse and confluent cultures. The cells were treated with increasing concentrations of H2O2 for 8 h, and then, the viability of cells was estimated from the trypan blue exclusion assay. As shown in Fig. 4, low concentrations of H2O2 (12.5 Î¼m) slightly increased viability of cells, but increasing the concentration of H2O2 produced a significant decline in the number of viable cells in sparse cultures in such a way that after treatment with 75â100 Î¼m H2O2nearly all cells were found not viable. In contrast, treatment of confluent cells with H2O2 up to concentrations of 75 Î¼m did not significantly affect their viability, and only a slight decrease in cell viability was observed at 100 Î¼m H2O2. We first tested the effect of exogenous H2O2 addition to HeLa cells on NQO1 activity. In these experiments, we used H2O2 in a concentration range where no significant losses of cell viability with respect to untreated cells had been observed, both in sparse and in confluent cultures (0â24 Î¼m; Fig. 4). Addition of H2O2 to HeLa cells at low density produced a significant increase of NQO1 activity that was proportional to the concentration of H2O2 used up to 12.5 Î¼m. Increasing the concentration of H2O2 up to 24 Î¼m did not result in a further increase of NQO1 activity, but a stabilization was observed (Fig. 5). When similar experiments were carried out with cells cultured to high density, the addition of H2O2 to the culture medium did not result in a significant change of NQO1, and the activity remained elevated at levels identical to those found for confluent cells not treated with H2O2 (Fig. 5). Because H2O2 stimulated NQO1 activity in sparse but not in confluent cultures, we tested the possibility that endogenous generation of H2O2 was involved in the observed rise of NQO1 activity as the cell density increased. To test the putative role of endogenous H2O2, cells were allowed to grow to confluency in the presence of 10 mm pyruvate. Culturing HeLa cells in the presence of 10 mm pyruvate did not affect significantly their growth rate with respect to cultures grown in its absence (Fig. 3 B). However, a much lower degree of NQO1 activation was observed in HeLa cells cultured in the presence of pyruvate (Fig. 3 A). Whereas scavenging of endogenous H2O2 by pyruvate resulted in a significant prevention of NQO1 increase, the activity was still stimulated about 13-fold with relation to low density cultures, which indicates that endogenous H2O2 is not the sole factor involved in the rise of NQO1 but that additional factors related with cell-to-cell interactions and/or growth conditions at high cellular densities should be considered (21Schlager J.J. Hoerl B.J. Riebow J. Scott D.P. Gasdaska P. Scott R.E. Powis G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1338-1342PubMed Google Scholar, 22Phillips R.M. de la Cruz A. Traver R.D. Gibson N.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3766-3771PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells showed density limitation of growth in such a way that cells exhibited a markedly reduced rate of proliferation at high density, measured as thymidine incorporation. Furthermore, substantial cell death was observed at cellular densities above 200,000 cells/cm2, even in the presence of fresh medium (Fig.1). To test whether increased NQO1 activity induced cell death or, instead, played a protective role, cultures of confluent HeLa cells were treated for 24 h with dicumarol at 20 Î¼m, and then the viability and proliferation rate of the cells was scored. This concentration of dicumarol, which fully inhibited NQO1 activity inin vitro enzymatic assays, was chosen to avoid inhibition of other related quinone reductases that are much more resistant to this compound (39Wu K. Knox R. Sun X.Z. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Zhang D. Deng P.S.-K. Chen S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). When the treatment was carried out in complete culture medium (containing 10% serum), no effect of dicumarol either on the viability or proliferation rate of cells was observed. However, treatment with the inhibitor in serum-free MEM resulted in a considerable decrease of the viability of cells and a reduction in their proliferation rate. Intermediate results were obtained when cells were treated with the inhibitor in the presence of 1% serum. The protective effect of serum reversing the effect of dicumarol treatment was likely due to serum albumin because treatment of cells with dicumarol in the presence of bovine serum albumin mimicked the protective effect of serum (Table I and Fig. 6). Thus, we can conclude that NQO1 plays a protective role, and this activity is necessary to maintain the viability of confluent HeLa cells in the absence of serum.Table IEffect of dicumarol on the viability of HeLa cells at high densityTreatmentViable cellsViable cells after dicumarol treatment%% control10% serum81.3 Â± 1.910% serum + 20 Î¼m dicumarol77.6 Â± 1.895.41% serum76.3 Â± 2.91% serum + 20 Î¼mdicumarol41.6 Â± 2.754.50% serum80.5 Â± 1.50% serum + 20 Î¼m dicumarol34.2 Â± 3.342.5Bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml)72 Â± 2.8Bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) + 20 Î¼m dicumarol70.5 Â± 4.797.9Bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml)71.7 Â± 4.3Bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) + 20 Î¼mdicumarol59.2 Â± 2.182.5HeLa cells cultured in MEM were supplemented with 10% serum until they reached confluence.

The overexpressed protein was found to be in inclusion bodies. The protein was solubilized using 1.5% N-lauroylsarcosine and was purified by gel permeation chromatography. The molecular mass of the protein was approximately 31 kDa. The eluted protein showed ATP-binding ability and exhibited ATPase activity. Among different nucleotide triphosphates, ATP was found to be the preferred substrate for M. tuberculosis PstB-ATPase. The study of the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis yielded K(m) of approximately 72 microm and V(max) of approximately 0.12 micromol/min/mg of protein. Divalent cation like manganese was inhibitory to the ATPase activity. Magnesium or calcium, on the other hand, had no influence on the functionality of the enzyme. The classical ATPase inhibitors like sodium azide, sodium vanadate, and N-ethylmaleimide were without any effect but an ATP analogue, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine, inhibited the ATPase function of the recombinant protein with a K(i) of approximately 0.40 mm. Furthermore, there was hardly any ATP hydrolyzing ability of the PstB as a result of mutation of the conserved aspartic acid residue to lysine in the Walker motif B, confirming the recombinant protein is an ATPase. Interestingly, analysis of the recombinant PstB revealed that it is a thermostable ATPase; thus, our results highlight for the first time the presence of such an enzyme in any mesophilic bacteria."

Three rat ROMK splice variants (ROMK1â3) are expressed in rat kidney and are identical except for distinct NH2-terminal extensions of 19 and 26 amino acids in ROMK1 and ROMK3, respectively (16Ho K.

We recently cloned SUR2B from rat kidney and showed that it was expressed in TAL and cortical collecting duct, similar to the localization of ROMK2 (15Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-expression of ROMK2 with SUR2B in Xenopus laevis oocytes generated glibenclamide-sensitive K+ currents, indicating that SUR2B could be involved in forming and regulating renal KATPchannels (15Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly neither ROMK1 nor ROMK3 formed glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channels when co-expressed with SUR2B (15Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the unique NH2-terminal extensions of ROMK1 and ROMK3 inhibited interactions with SUR2B. In the present study we evaluated the role of the unique NH2-terminal amino acids of ROMK1 in determining interactions with SUR2B using electrophysiology and co-immunoprecipitation methods.DISCUSSIONThe present study defines the molecular site on ROMK1 that inhibits its interaction with SUR2B to form a sulfonylurea-sensitive K+ channel. Our previous study demonstrated that ROMK2, but not ROMK1 or ROMK3, formed a glibenclamide-sensitive K+channel when co-expressed with SUR2B (15Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ROMK1 and ROMK3 are alternatively spliced forms of the renal ATP-regulated K+channel that contain NH2-terminal extensions of 19 and 26 amino acid residues, respectively. Compared with ROMK2, ROMK1 and ROMK3 share a 7-amino acid segment just preceding the ROMK2 initiator methionine (Fig. 1) and we had proposed that this segment could be involved in blocking the interaction of ROMK and SUR2B (15Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we confirmed that ROMK2, but not ROMK1, formed a glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channel when co-expressed with SUR2B, and we have now identified three amino acids (in ROMK1 amino acids 15â17, IRA) that inhibit the interaction with SUR2B and thus render the ROMK1 channel insensitive to glibenclamide. This amino acid triplet is contained within the 7-amino acid region, 13â19, which is identical to amino acids 20â26 in ROMK3 and could also account for the lack of ROMK3 interaction with SUR2B.Since glibenclamide sensitivity was only observed when ROMK co-immunoprecipitated with SUR2B, sulfonylurea sensitivity requires direct interaction between these two proteins. While we do not know the stoichiometry of ROMK-SUR2B to form glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channels in oocytes, previous studies of SUR1 and the ATP-sensitive K+ channel Kir6.2 demonstrated a one-to-one stoichiometry in a 4:4 hetero-octamer (3Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J.P. Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The NH2terminus of Kir6.2 has been suggested to provide a site for coupling to the sulfonylurea receptor (21Reimann F. Tucker S.J. Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 325-336Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to investigate what regions and amino acid residues in ROMK2 play a similar role in the interaction with SUR2B. If a similar region in ROMK2 is required for interacting with SUR2B, then it is possible that the inhibitory âIRAâ triplet in ROMK1 interferes with this NH2-terminal SUR2B binding site by either binding to this region or altering its structure. Interestingly the relative position within the NH2 terminus of this amino acid triplet appears to be critical since transposing it to the beginning of the NH2 terminus allows ROMK1 interaction with SUR2B.It is generally accepted that ROMK forms the small conductance ATP-regulated and glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channel in distal nephron segments of the mammalian kidney mediating K+ secretion (5Wang W. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Palmer L.G. Choe H. Frindt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F404-F410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When ROMK is expressed alone in X. laevis oocytes it is not sensitive to glibenclamide (9McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M.

In this regard, ROMK2 has been shown to form glibenclamide-sensitive K+ currents when co-expressed with the CFTR (9McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc.

Thus, both CFTR and SUR2B may contribute to forming ATP-regulated, small conductance K+ secretory channels in the kidney.While ROMK2-SUR2B and ROMK2-CFTR can form glibenclamide-sensitive K+ currents, CFTR, but not SUR2B, can also impart sulfonylurea sensitivity to K+ currents when co-expressed with ROMK1. ROMK2 is expressed in all distal nephron segments from the TAL to the cortical collecting duct, while ROMK1 is found only in the collecting duct and ROMK3 in TAL cells. The medullary TAL expresses ROMK2, ROMK3, and CFTR, while the cortical TAL expresses ROMK2, ROMK3, CFTR, and SUR2B. The cortical collecting duct expresses ROMK1, ROMK2, CFTR, and SUR2B. Thus TAL and collecting duct cells may express different combinations of ROMK- and sulfonylurea-interacting proteins to give rise to the ATP-regulated, glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channels found in apical membranes of these nephron segments.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the specific location of amino acid triplet IRA (residues 13â15) in the NH2-terminal extension of ROMK1 (and likely ROMK3) plays a key role in the inhibition of subunit assembly of the renal secretary KATP channel ROMK with SUR2B and can account for the lack of glibenclamide sensitivity when SUR2B is co-expressed with ROMK1 or ROMK3.

These channels are formed by octameric complexes of two types of subunits: a pore-forming subunit, the inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir6.1, Kir6.2, or Kir1.1), and a regulatory subunit, the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) or the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), members of the ATP binding cassette transporter protein family (3Aguilar-Bryan L.

SUR1 associates with Kir6.2 to form the neuronal/pancreatic Î²-cell-type KATP channel; SUR2A and SUR2B, splice variants of a single gene, form either the cardiac-type (SUR2A/Kir6.2) or the vascular smooth muscle-type (SUR2B/Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) KATPchannels. Renal KATP channels have been identified in the apical membranes of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL) and principal cells of the cortical collecting duct where they mediate K+ secretion (4Misler S.

Three rat ROMK splice variants (ROMK1â3) are expressed in rat kidney and are identical except for distinct NH2-terminal extensions of 19 and 26 amino acids in ROMK1 and ROMK3, respectively (16Ho K.

We recently cloned SUR2B from rat kidney and showed that it was expressed in TAL and cortical collecting duct, similar to the localization of ROMK2 (15Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Co-expression of ROMK2 with SUR2B in Xenopus laevis oocytes generated glibenclamide-sensitive K+ currents, indicating that SUR2B could be involved in forming and regulating renal KATPchannels (15Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly neither ROMK1 nor ROMK3 formed glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channels when co-expressed with SUR2B (15Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the unique NH2-terminal extensions of ROMK1 and ROMK3 inhibited interactions with SUR2B. In the present study we evaluated the role of the unique NH2-terminal amino acids of ROMK1 in determining interactions with SUR2B using electrophysiology and co-immunoprecipitation methods. DISCUSSIONThe present study defines the molecular site on ROMK1 that inhibits its interaction with SUR2B to form a sulfonylurea-sensitive K+ channel. Our previous study demonstrated that ROMK2, but not ROMK1 or ROMK3, formed a glibenclamide-sensitive K+channel when co-expressed with SUR2B (15Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ROMK1 and ROMK3 are alternatively spliced forms of the renal ATP-regulated K+channel that contain NH2-terminal extensions of 19 and 26 amino acid residues, respectively. Compared with ROMK2, ROMK1 and ROMK3 share a 7-amino acid segment just preceding the ROMK2 initiator methionine (Fig. 1) and we had proposed that this segment could be involved in blocking the interaction of ROMK and SUR2B (15Tanemoto M. Vanoye C.G. Dong K. Welch R. Abe T. Hebert S.C. Xu J.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F659-F666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we confirmed that ROMK2, but not ROMK1, formed a glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channel when co-expressed with SUR2B, and we have now identified three amino acids (in ROMK1 amino acids 15â17, IRA) that inhibit the interaction with SUR2B and thus render the ROMK1 channel insensitive to glibenclamide. This amino acid triplet is contained within the 7-amino acid region, 13â19, which is identical to amino acids 20â26 in ROMK3 and could also account for the lack of ROMK3 interaction with SUR2B.Since glibenclamide sensitivity was only observed when ROMK co-immunoprecipitated with SUR2B, sulfonylurea sensitivity requires direct interaction between these two proteins. While we do not know the stoichiometry of ROMK-SUR2B to form glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channels in oocytes, previous studies of SUR1 and the ATP-sensitive K+ channel Kir6.2 demonstrated a one-to-one stoichiometry in a 4:4 hetero-octamer (3Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J.P. Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The NH2terminus of Kir6.2 has been suggested to provide a site for coupling to the sulfonylurea receptor (21Reimann F. Tucker S.J. Proks P. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 325-336Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to investigate what regions and amino acid residues in ROMK2 play a similar role in the interaction with SUR2B. If a similar region in ROMK2 is required for interacting with SUR2B, then it is possible that the inhibitory âIRAâ triplet in ROMK1 interferes with this NH2-terminal SUR2B binding site by either binding to this region or altering its structure. Interestingly the relative position within the NH2 terminus of this amino acid triplet appears to be critical since transposing it to the beginning of the NH2 terminus allows ROMK1 interaction with SUR2B.It is generally accepted that ROMK forms the small conductance ATP-regulated and glibenclamide-sensitive K+ channel in distal nephron segments of the mammalian kidney mediating K+ secretion (5Wang W. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Palmer L.G. Choe H. Frindt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F404-F410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When ROMK is expressed alone in X. laevis oocytes it is not sensitive to glibenclamide (9McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M.

https://openalex.org/W2145261835,"TAFII105 is a sub-stoichiometric subunit of TFIID important for activation of anti-apoptotic genes and B cell specific genes by the transcription factors NF-ÎºB and OCA-B. This subunit is highly enriched in B and T lymphocytes, and its expression is regulated at a posttranscriptional level. In the present study we investigated the subcellular localization of TAFII105. In normal B cells, a significant portion of native TAFII105 protein is found in the cytoplasm. Treatment of these cells with B cell-specific stimuli decreased the level of cytoplasmic TAFII105. In adherent cultured cells, TAFII105 is predominantly nuclear; however, a small fraction of the cells showed either cytoplasmic or homogenous distribution of TAFII105. Analysis of different TAFII105 mutants and green fluorescence protein fusion proteins identified a region composed of two adjacent sequences displaying nuclear export activity, suggesting that nuclear export of TAFII105 is mediated by a composite nuclear export signal. TAFII105 nuclear export signal is leptomycin B-resistant indicating that it belongs to a CRM1-independent nuclear export pathway. These results reveal a novel mode of regulation of a specialized component of the general transcription apparatus that may affect the transcription of its target genes.

In normal B cells, a significant portion of native TAFII105 protein is found in the cytoplasm. Treatment of these cells with B cell-specific stimuli decreased the level of cytoplasmic TAFII105. In adherent cultured cells, TAFII105 is predominantly nuclear; however, a small fraction of the cells showed either cytoplasmic or homogenous distribution of TAFII105. Analysis of different TAFII105 mutants and green fluorescence protein fusion proteins identified a region composed of two adjacent sequences displaying nuclear export activity, suggesting that nuclear export of TAFII105 is mediated by a composite nuclear export signal. TAFII105 nuclear export signal is leptomycin B-resistant indicating that it belongs to a CRM1-independent nuclear export pathway. These results reveal a novel mode of regulation of a specialized component of the general transcription apparatus that may affect the transcription of its target genes. pre-initiation complex TATA-binding polypeptide expressed sequence tag nuclear localization signal nuclear export signals lipopolysaccharide phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction green fluorescence protein Tris-buffered saline leptomycin B Transcription of class II genes involves the assembly of general transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH) and RNA polymerase II around the transcription start site to form a pre-initiation complex (PIC).1 The general transcription factor TFIID plays an important role in PIC formation, as it is responsible for recognition and binding to core promoter elements. TFIID is a multi-subunit complex consisting of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and associated factors (TAFIIs). TAFIIs play several important roles in transcription (reviewed in Refs. 1Verrijzer C.P.

Certain TAFIIs interact with activation domains of transcription factors transmitting their signal to the general transcription machinery. In addition, some of the TAFIIs are required for recognition of and binding to core promoter elements such as the initiator and the downstream promoter element (4Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Chen J.L.

Biochemical analysis and x-ray crystallography of TAFIIs showed that each subunit forms multiple contacts with other TAFIIs in the complex, and many of these interactions are mediated through histone fold motifs (10Gangloff Y.

Genetic studies in yeast carrying mutations in individual TAFIIs subunits indicated that some TAFIIs are required for transcription of the majority of class II genes and others for transcription activation of only subsets of genes (11Apone L.M.

Recently, some of the TAFIIs were found to be integral components of other transcription regulatory complexes such as the yeast SAGA and human PCAF and TFTC (22Grant P.A. Schielz D. Pray-Grant M.G.

It is expressed at high levels in cells of lymphoid origin relative to other tissues and cell types (24Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 2A. Silkov, O. Wolstein, I. Shachar, and R. Dikstein, submitted for publication.Interestingly, recent data obtained from the human genome project revealed another gene on chromosome 4 encoding close homolog of TAFII105 (accession number AC017007). The previously identified gene is located on chromosome 18 (accession number Y09321). As we found an EST clone identical to the chromosome 4 gene, it is likely that this gene is also expressed. Thus it appears that the family of these TAFIIs is larger than initially anticipated. Analysis of TAFII105 function in cultured cells, in vitro and in an animal model provided evidence that it is involved in transcription activation by p65/RelA, a member of NF-ÎºB family (26Yamit-Hezi A.

TAFII105 is present only in a small fraction of TFIID complexes and is involved in transcription of a subset of genes (27Yamit-Hezi A. Nir S. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).2 The C-terminal domain of hTAFII105 is highly homologous to the C termini of hTAFII135 and dTAFII110 and is essential for assembly into the TFIID complex.2 The N terminus of TAFII105 is more variable and contains binding sites for the activation domains of p65/RelA and OCA-B (26Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Wolstein O. Silkov A. Revach M. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16459-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TAFII105 expression is regulated at the posttranscriptional level since the mRNA levels of TAFII105 in different cell types are similar, whereas a larger amount of protein is present in TFIID complex and in nuclear extracts of B cell lines than in non B cell lines (24Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). One way to regulate biological processes at the posttranscriptional level is by modulating the subcellular localization of the controlling proteins. The activity of nuclear proteins can be adjusted via their nuclear import or export. Nuclear transport in eukaryotic cell is triggered by specific transport signals that are recognized by receptors in the nuclear pore complexes (30Allen T.D. Cronshaw J.M. Bagley S. Kiseleva E. Goldberg M.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear import is mediated by the nuclear localization signal (NLS) present in nuclear proteins. This process involves the importin Î± and importin Î² proteins that usually function in complex with Ran GTPase (reviewed in Ref. 31GoÌrlich D. EMBO. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Nuclear export is much less characterized than nuclear import. Like import, nuclear export is mediated by specific signals, known as nuclear export signals (NES). There are two relatively well defined export proteins: CAS exportin and CRM1 protein. Human CRM1 (hCRM1) binds leucine-rich NESs found in different proteins such as Rev, MKK1, IÎºB and cyclinB (32Fornerod M. Deursen J. Baal S. Reynolds A. Davis D. Murti K.G. Fransen J. Grosveld G.

Vuillard L. Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The CRM1-NES interaction is Ran-GTP-dependent and GTP hydrolysis is required for triggering cytoplasmic dissociation of exported protein from CRM1 (reviewed in Ref. 35Turpin P. Ossareh-Nazari B. Dargemont C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another known NES is KNS that utilizes CRM1-independent pathway, and its sequence specificity distinguishes it from other nuclear transport signals (36Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We have investigated the regulation of human and mouse TAFII105 protein. We report that TAFII105 is exported to the cytoplasm through a composite NES consisting of two adjacent and independent domains bearing nuclear export activity. TAFII105 NES is resistant to the CRM1-specific inhibitor leptomycin B indicating that it is exported by a CRM1-independent nuclear export pathway. The results suggest that the subcellular localization of TAFII105 is a useful mean of controlling TAFII105 assembly into the TFIID complex and transcription of its target genes. Single cell suspensions from spleen were prepared by crushing the organs in RPMI 1640 medium without serum followed by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. An enriched population of B cells was obtained from splenocytes by treatment with eliminating anti-CD4, anti-CD8, and anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) and rabbit complement (Cedarline, Ontario, Canada). B cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Splenic B cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 Î¼g/ml, Sigma) or anti-IgM monoclonal antibody (25 Î¼g/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Cells were counted, and 107cells were precipitated and washed once with PBS and once with 1 ml of dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg Cl2). Cells were resuspended in 300 Î¼l of hypotonic buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Triton X-100, 2 mmdithiothreitol) and incubated 10 min on ice. Soluble cytoplasmic proteins were obtained by centrifugation of lysates at 12,000 g for 2 min and collecting the supernatant. For nuclear proteins, the pellet was resuspended in 50 Î¼l of buffer C1 (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 140 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The volume of resuspended pellet was measured, and an equal volume of buffer C2 (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 700 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol) was added. The suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min. Supernatant containing nuclear proteins was collected. All buffers were supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors. Cell-equivalent amounts of extracts were loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by electrotransfer into nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% low fat milk for 1 h, incubated with primary antibodies diluted 1:2000 in PBST for 1 h, followed by 45 min of incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000 dilution). For detection Super-Signal reagent (Pierce) was used. Quantification was done using the Image-Gouge program (Fuji). Cells were removed from the plates, washed with PBS, suspended in the 5 volumes of buffer A (10 mmHepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH7.9) and incubated for 20 min on ice. After brief centrifugation cells were resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer A and lysed by passing through a syringe or by Dounce homogenizer followed by centrifugation. To the upper phase, cytoplasmic extract, 11% volume of buffer B (0.3 m Hepes, 1.4 m KCl, 0.03m MgCl2) was added. The pellet containing nuclei was suspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mNaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH7.9), Dounced in homogenizer, incubated on a rotator, and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 293T are human embryonic kidney fibroblasts expressing SV 40 large T antigen that allows expression of plasmids with SV 40 origin. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (200 I.U./ml), and streptomycin (100 Î¼g/ml). Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate (CaPO4) coprecipitation technique in 24-well plates containing 8 Ã 104 293T cells/well. Transfection mixture contained 150 ng of expression vector. In each transfection the amount of cytomegalovirus-containing plasmid was constant. Total DNA was kept to 1 Î¼g/well by supplementing with 850 ng of pUC18 DNA. Cells were harvested 24â36 h after the transfection and subjected to immunostaining. TAFII105 and various C-terminal truncated TAFII105-expressing plasmids were described previously (27Yamit-Hezi A. Nir S. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To construct TAFII105Î465â469 and TAFII105(1â552)Î465â469 expressing plasmid we employed PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). We used pCGN-TAFII105 and pCGN-TAFII105(1â552) plasmids as templates and PCR Primers: 5â²-GCA GTT CAA GTC AAG CAA CTA GTA GTT CAG CAG CCT TCA GG-3â²; 5â²-CCT GAA GGC TGC TGA ACT ACT AGT TGC TTG ACT TGA ACT GC-3â²; pCGN-TAFII105(1â475)Î465â469 was obtained from the above reactions except that a point mutation after amino acid 475 yielded a stop codon. All the mutants were sequenced and analyzed for protein expression. GFP-(449â475), GFP-(470â495), and GFP-(495â540) were generated by insertion of a PCR fragment encoding 450â475, 470â495, and 495â540 amino acids of TAFII105, respectively, into GFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH). These peptides were provided with BglII and BamHI restriction sites on their 5â²- and 3â²-ends and inserted intoBglII restriction site of GFP-C3 vector. All fusions were sequenced to verify in-frame cloning and accuracy of sequence. The following PCR primers were used. 449â475: upstream 5â²-GAA GAT CTT TCA CAA CCA GCT GGG ATT CC-3â²; downstream 5â²-GGG GAT CCC CTG AAG GCT GCT GAA CTA C-3â². 470â495: upstream 5â²-GAA GAT CTG GTA GTT CAG CAG CCT TCA G-3â²; downstream 5â²-GGG GAT CCC ATT TCT GAA TGG TCA ATG-3â². 495â540: upstream 5â²-GGA GAT CTG AAA TGT GGA CAG AAG ACG-3â²; downstream 5â²-GGG GAT CCA TTC TAT TTT TCT GAG TAG G-3â². Upstream primers contain BglII restriction site, and downstream primers contain BamHI site. GFP-MKK1 used as a positive control in our studies is a gift from R. Seger (Weizmann Institute). HEK 293T cells were grown on coverslips coated with 20 Î¼g/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma P1274) and harvested 24 h after transfection. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, rinsed, and blocked with blocking solution (TBS, 10% goat serum (Sigma G6767), 1% glycine, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20). Cells were incubated with affinity-purified anti-TAFII105 antibodies (1:100 dilution for endogenous protein and 1:200 dilution for transfected protein) for 1 h, rinsed in PBS, and incubated 1 h with secondary antibody (nitro blue tetrazolium, Alexa 488,A11034). The cells were rinsed again, incubated for 5 min with propidium iodide (2 Ã 10â4 mg/ml), and rinsed again. Samples were mounted with DAKO Fluorescent Mounting Medium (DAKO S3023). Photographs were taken at the Ã60 objective. GST-TAFII105(1â552) was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified on glutathione beads. The protein was cross-linked to the beads in 0.2 m sodium borate, pH 9, by 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linking was terminated by 2 h of incubation with 0.2 m ethanolamine, pH 8, and the beads were then washed with the equilibration buffer (0.5 m NaCl, PBS). The serum containing Î±-TAFII105 antibodies was loaded onto TAFII105 column. The beads were washed with washing buffer (0.5 m NaCl, PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40) and equilibrated again with equilibration buffer. The antibody was released from the antigen using the elution buffer (50 mm glycine, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.5). The pH value of the antibody was neutralized using 1 m Tris, pH 7.9, and the antibodies solution was dialyzed against PBS. TAFII105 is highly expressed in the spleen and the thymus of the mouse.2 To examine the subcellular localization of TAFII105, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from normal mouse B cells isolated from spleen, and cell-equivalent amounts of these fractions were analyzed for the presence of TAFII105 by immunoblot. As expected, most of TAFII105 protein was nuclear; however, a significant portion was also seen in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig.1, lanes 1 and 6). As TAFII105 is a transcription factor its presence in the cytoplasm of resting B cells raises the possibility that its transport into and out of the nucleus may be regulated. Therefore we examined the effect of extracellular signals on TAFII105 localization in B cells. We used LPS and anti-IgM antibodies to induce a mitogenic response in primary B cell. As the survival of the primary culture decreases with time resulting in lower number of live cells at late time points, we determined the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic levels of TAFII105 protein at different time points after stimulation. The results (Fig. 1) indicate that B cell activation either by LPS or anti-IgM is associated with an increase in the relative amount of nuclear TAFII105 compared with the cytoplasmic protein. As a control of nuclear and cytoplasmic extract preparation, a similar analysis was carried out with the same extracts using antibodies against OCT2, a B cell specific transcription factor. As shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel) OCT2 is found exclusively in the nuclear fraction. Since we did not observe appearance of degradation products of TAFII105 in the cytoplasmic extracts of activated cells, it is likely that activation by LPS and anti-IgM affects the transport of TAFII105 protein into or out of the nucleus. Next we examined the intracellular location of TAFII105 in HEK 293 cell line by immunostaining of the endogenous protein together with propidium iodide to visualize the nuclei (Fig.2 A) and by immunoblot of fractionated extracts (Fig. 2 C). In the majority of the cells TAFII105 was found accumulated in the nucleus. However, in some cells (5â7%) it was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm or dispersed throughout the whole cell. To confirm the specificity of TAFII105 staining, HEK 293 cells were immunostained with an irrelevant primary rabbit polyclonal antibody purified by the same method, and only background staining was observed (data not shown). The background of the secondary antibody was also examined and found to be negligible (data not shown). A similar finding was observed using different fixing agents indicating that this phenomenon is not generated by the paraformaldehyde (data not shown). To validate the specificity of the cytoplasmic staining of TAFII105, 293 cells were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies directed against p65/RelA together with anti-TAFII105 antibodies. Fig. 2 B shows a representative field of which p65/RelA is localized in the cytoplasm of non-stimulated cells consistent with previous reports, whereas TAFII105 staining is nuclear in some cells or is cytoplasmic in others. Taken together, these results suggest that subcellular localization of TAFII105 is regulated, and under certain circumstances it can be found in the cytoplasm. To investigate further the localization of TAFII105, HEK 293 cells were transfected with a TAFII105-expressing plasmid immunostained with TAFII105 antibodies and observed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3). Transfected TAFII105 is found both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus but, in contrast to the native protein, is more abundant in the cytoplasm. Nuclear staining can be clearly seen only in cells that express high amounts of TAFII105 protein, whereas cytoplasmic TAFII105 is seen in low expressing cells, indicating that localization in the cytoplasm is not caused by an excess of TAFII105 expression. Cytoplasmic localization of TAFII105 is also observed in fractionated extracts (Fig.3 B). Thus, the possibility is raised that TAFII105 may be exported from the nucleus through a NES. To determine whether TAFII105 bears a NES, we looked at the subcellular localization of several C-terminal deletion mutants of TAFII105, reasoning that removal of NES would result in nuclear accumulation. Since the putative NLS of TAFII105 is situated in the C terminus of the protein, an NLS derived from the SV-40 large T antigen was fused to all C-terminal-truncated TAFII105 mutants. The mutants were transfected into HEK 293T cells and analyzed by immunostaining with TAFII105-specific antibodies. As before, nuclei were visualized by propidium iodide staining (Fig.4). Notably, despite the presence of heterologous NLS, cellular distribution of TAFII105(1â552) was similar to the full-length protein and found predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, aâd). A mutant truncated by a further 80 amino acids (TAFII105(1â472)) was also excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 4, e and f). With further deletion of 20 amino acids the mutant TAFII105(1â452) showed nuclear localization (Fig. 4, g and h). Expression of all mutants was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis of cell extract from the cells transfected with all mutants we used (data not shown). The results imply that TAFII105 contains NES activity located between amino acids 452 and 472. Search of the human genome data base revealed an additional gene on chromosome 4 encoding a close homolog of TAFII105 (we named it TAFII105Î² and the original gene as TAFII105Î±). As we found an EST clone (accession numberBE936325) encoding for a DNA sequence identical to TAFII105Î² it is likely that TAFII105Î² is expressed. In addition, we found an EST clone (accession numberAW297262) almost identical to TAFII105Î±. When we compared the region important for nuclear export between the three genes we found that TAFII105Î± contains insertion of five amino acids (465) that are not present in TAFII105Î² and EST clone AW297262 (Fig. 5 A). To examine whether these extra amino acids in TAFII105Î± are important for nuclear export of this protein a deletion of these amino acids was introduced in TAFII105(1â552) and TAFII105(1â475) to generate TAFII105(1â552)Î465â469 and TAFII105(1â475)Î465â469. The new mutants were transfected into HEK 293T cells, and their localization was determined (Fig. 5 B). As before, TAFII105(1â472) was mostly cytoplasmic (Fig. 5 B, c and d). However, TAFII105(1â475)Î465â469 was nuclear indicating that amino acids 465â469 are important for NES function. Interestingly, the same deletion in the context of TAFII105(1â552) (Fig. 5 B, a andb) or the full-length protein (data not shown) did not affect its cytoplasmic accumulation. One possible explanation of this result is that in TAFII105(1â552) there are additional sequence(s) contributing to its nuclear export, and disruption of one was not sufficient to prevent nuclear export. In TAFII105(1â475) mutant there is only one NES so its disruption by deletion of amino acids 465â469 (FSLFH motif) abolishes export activity. Thus, a second NES must lie C-terminally to amino acid 475. This result suggests that the unique presence of the FSLFH sequence in TAFII105Î± has a potential role in the control of its cellular localization. Remarkably the FSLFH motif is situated near the major NF-ÎºB binding site within TAFII105. We found that deletion of this motif does not affect p65/RelA binding to TAFII105 (the important sequence for p65/RelA binding is found within 454â462 region that is conserved between all the homologs. 3O. Wolstein and R. Dikstein, unpublished data. The proximity of these domains raised the possibility that NF-ÎºB binding and nuclear export protein binding with TAFII105Î± may be mutually exclusive. However, co-transfection of p65/RelA with TAFII105(1â552) did not significantly affect its localization possibly due to the presence of a second NES within TAFII105A (data not shown). To characterize the NES of TAFII105, we analyzed its activity in a heterologous system. The region containing the NES candidate sequences in TAFII105 was divided into subdomains and fused to the GFP protein (Fig. 6). The fusion proteins were transfected into HEK 293, and the expressed proteins were visualized by fluorescent microscopy. As shown, GFP stains cells homogeneously. Fusion of GFP to a fragment encoding for amino acid 495â540 of TAFII105 resulted in distribution similar to that of GFP. The region encoding for amino acids 449â475 exported GFP from the nucleus resulting in more cytoplasmic accumulation. Interestingly, the region of amino acids 470â495 was also capable of driving GFP out of the nucleus. Since the mutant TAFII105(1â475)Î465â469 is located in the nucleus (Fig.5), the presence of amino acids 470â475, which are common to both, is not sufficient to promote nuclear export. Thus, we suggest that TAFII105 contains a nuclear export signal composed of two sequential and independent domains with nuclear export activity that are mapped to amino acids 449â470 and 475â495. Nuclear pore complex protein, CRM1, is able to recognize specific leucine-rich NESs and mediate protein export from the nucleus (reviewed in Ref. 33GoÌrlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). CRM1 is a target of the cytotoxin leptomycin B (LMB). By direct binding of LMB to CRM1, LMB disrupts NES-dependent nuclear export of proteins both in yeast and mammals (37Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In light of the data suggesting that TAFII105 contains NES, we examined whether it is CRM1-dependent. We incubated cells transfected with full-length TAFII105 or TAFII105(1â552) for 2 h with 20 ng/ml LMB (Fig.7). There was no influence of LMB on the nuclear export of either full-length TAFII105 or TAFII105(1â552), whereas MKK1-GFP protein, whose export is known to be dependent on CRM1, (38Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 39Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adahi A. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 303-305Crossref Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) accumulated in the nucleus in the presence of only 5 ng/ml LMB (Fig. 7, kâl). We also examined the effect of LMB on each of TAFII105 domains having nuclear export activity and found that neither of them directs nuclear export through CRM1 (data not shown). Thus TAFII105 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through a pathway that is distinct from CRM1. In the present study we investigated the subcellular localization of TAFII105, a sub-stoichiometric subunit of TFIID complex. We found that TAFII105 is able to shuttle between the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and this transfer is mediated by two adjacent nuclear export signals. Hence, it appears that the subcellular localization of components of the basal transcriptional machinery represents an additional mean of large-scale transcriptional control. Fractionation of primary B cells revealed that TAFII105 is localized in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm and that its cytoplasmic level is reduced in response to the mitogenic stimuli LPS and anti-IgM. As we could not find signs of degradation of the cytoplasmic protein in response to LPS and anti-IgM, the presence of NES in TAFII105 suggests that these extracellular stimuli inhibit its export from the nucleus. Given that induction of B cells, either by LPS or anti-IgM mimics antigenic stimulus to some extent, it is possible that TAFII105 localization is associated with an immune response. This is consistent with its role in activation of subset of B cell-specific genes (28Matza D. Wolstein O. Dikstein R. Shachar I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27203-27206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 29Wolstein O. Silkov A. Revach M. Dikstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16459-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).2 In adherent cultured cells immunostaining experiments showed that endogenous TAFII105 might be localized either in the nucleus or the cytoplasm in some cells, whereas in others it is dispersed homogeneously throughout the cell. Such differences in TAFII105 localization could be associated with the cell cycle stage of a given cell or with its physiological state. However, at present we were unable to link differential localization of TAFII105 to a specific stage of the cell cycle (data not shown). Given that TAFII105 is involved in activation of anti-apoptotic genes (26Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)2 it is possible that this protein is excluded from the nucleus in cells undergoing apoptosis. Since only advanced apoptotic stages can be morphologically observed (reviewed in Ref. 25Hacker G. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 301: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), TAFII105 transfer outside the nucleus in some cells might be one of the initial pro-apoptotic events. Comparison of the cytoplasmic localization of endogenous to transfected TAFII105 protein revealed marked differences in TAFII105 distribution. The level of endogenous TAFII105 in the cytoplasm is lower than that of transfected TAFII105. The distribution of transfected TAFII105 seems to be more comparable with its distribution in normal B cells. A probable explanation to this difference might be that the fraction of transfected TAFII105 that is not incorporated into TFIID complex is exported from the nucleus, whereas TAFII105 that is bound to the TFIID escapes the export machinery. Alternatively, as TAFII105 protein may be encoded by at least two genes, it is possible that these genes are differentially regulated and that the protein present in 293 cells is not identical to the transfected one. Using different TAFII105-truncated mutants as well as GFP-fused peptides of TAFII105 we found that TAFII105 NES consists of two domains located in the middle of the protein. Considering that all of the C-terminally TAFII105-truncated mutants contained heterologous NLS derived from T antigen of SV-40, the cytoplasmic localization of some of these mutants provides further support for the existence of a strong NES. We mapped the first domain in the region between amino acids 452â472 and an additional domain immediately next to it, within amino acid 475â495. It seems that within TAFII105 these two regions collaborate to allow efficient export of the protein. Importantly, both domains are situated near NF-ÎºB binding site within TAFII1053, raising the possibility that binding of p65 to TAFII105 might represent a physical obstacle for binding by export protein. Yet, when the p65/RelA component of NF-ÎºB was co-expressed with TAFII105, no significant effect on cellular localization of TAFII105 was observed (data not shown). There is a group of NESs composed of leucine-rich sequences known to be targeted by CRM1. TAFII105 NESs were not influenced by the CRM1-specific inhibitor LMB, indicating that its export is mediated by a CRM1-independent pathway. Consistent with their LMB-independent function, these NESs are not similar to the consensus leucine-rich sequence. Since the field of nuclear export is relatively new, nuclear export of TAFII105 may be directed by a new exportin receptor that recognizes specifically its NESs. Apparently, additional experiments are required to address the mechanism by which TAFII105 is exported and the importance of its nuclear export. We thank Dr. R.
