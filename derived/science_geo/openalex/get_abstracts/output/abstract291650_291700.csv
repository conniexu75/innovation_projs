https://openalex.org/W2007885388,"A variant of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter with transcriptional activity approximately tenfold higher than that of the natural promoter was constructed by tandem duplication of 250 base pairs of upstream sequences. The duplicated region also acted as a strong enhancer of heterologous promoters, increasing the activity of an adjacent and divergently transcribed transferred DNA gene several hundredfold, and to a lesser extent, that of another transferred DNA gene from a remote downstream position. This optimized enhancer element should be very useful for obtaining high levels of expression of foreign genes in transgenic plants."
https://openalex.org/W2093657535,The discrepancy between the magnetic hysteresis properties of magnetite crystals that are precipitated from solution (<0.3 micrometer) and of crushed sifted grains (>0.3 micrometer) is not an inherent property of magnetite but is caused by the highly stressed state of crushed material and by adhering finer fragments. The size trends of magnetic properties exhibited by submicrometer-size precipitated grains continue in the size range from 1 micrometer to 1 millimeter in a set of hydrothermally recrystallized magnetite crystals. Coercive forces of these narrowly sized crystals follow a power law over a wide size range (0.1 micrometer to 1 millimeter) as predicted by theory. Dislocation etch pits show similar dislocation densities for hydrothermally grown (3 x 10(10) meter (-2)) and natural (1 x 10(10) meter(-2)) magnetite crystals. Hysteresis parameters of hydrothermally grown crystals are similar to those of natural crystals but are about one-fifth of those for crushed grains.
https://openalex.org/W2115888300,"Until recently, gene transfer in plants was achieved only by sexual hybridization. Now, in addition, plant genetic manipulation, with the use of both recombinant DNA and protoplast fusion technology, is being applied to an increasing range of plants. The soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, with its associated plasmid, is used as a vector for introducing DNA into the genomes of dicotyledonous plants, but it has not proved suitable for cereals. Instead, the direct uptake of plasmid DNA into cereal protoplasts is being used for the transformation of cells in rice, wheat, and maize. Transformation efficiencies, in some cases, are becoming comparable to those obtained in dicotyledons with Agrobacterium In rice it is now possible to regenerate efficiently whole plants from protoplasts, and this capability may soon be extended to the other cereals. By means of direct interaction of cereal protoplasts with plasmids, coupled with improved procedures for the regeneration of plants from their protoplasts, gene transfer in the cereals is becoming established at the frontiers of recombinant DNA technology."

https://openalex.org/W2034687857,"Amyloodinium ocellatum, a common dinoflagellate ectoparasite of marine fishes, was successfully propagated on a fish gill cell line. In vitro infections were similar in cytopathology and development to those reported on natural hosts, and large numbers of parasites could be produced. Exposure of parasites in cell culture to an antiprotozoal drug produced a dose-dependent inhibition of infectivity that was much more sensitive than a motility assay previously used to assess the toxic effects of a drug on protozoan ectoparasites. This propagation system may be a useful model for studying the biology and control of protozoan skin parasites of fishes and for quantitatively studying hostparasite interaction at cellular interfaces."
