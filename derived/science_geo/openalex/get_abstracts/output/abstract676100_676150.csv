https://openalex.org/W3175961346,"Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, patients with and survivors of COVID-19 can suffer neurological symptoms1-3. However, an unbiased understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that are affected in the brains of patients with COVID-19 is missing. Here we profile 65,309 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 30 frontal cortex and choroid plexus samples across 14 control individuals (including 1 patient with terminal influenza) and 8 patients with COVID-19. Although our systematic analysis yields no molecular traces of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain, we observe broad cellular perturbations indicating that barrier cells of the choroid plexus sense and relay peripheral inflammation into the brain and show that peripheral T cells infiltrate the parenchyma. We discover microglia and astrocyte subpopulations associated with COVID-19 that share features with pathological cell states that have previously been reported in human neurodegenerative disease4-6. Synaptic signalling of upper-layer excitatory neurons-which are evolutionarily expanded in humans7 and linked to cognitive function8-is preferentially affected in COVID-19. Across cell types, perturbations associated with COVID-19 overlap with those found in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognition, schizophrenia and depression. Our findings and public dataset provide a molecular framework to understand current observations of COVID-19-related neurological disease, and any such disease that may emerge at a later date."

Although cell culture experiments have demonstrated a loss of potency of several anti-spike neutralizing antibodies against variant strains of SARS-CoV-21-3, the in vivo importance of these results remains uncertain. Here we report the in vitro and in vivo activity of a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which correspond to many in advanced clinical development by Vir Biotechnology, AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Regeneron and Lilly, against SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses. Although some individual mAbs showed reduced or abrogated neutralizing activity in cell culture against B.1.351, B.1.1.28, B.1.617.1 and B.1.526 viruses with mutations at residue E484 of the spike protein, low prophylactic doses of mAb combinations protected against infection by many variants in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, 129S2 immunocompetent mice and hamsters, without the emergence of resistance. Exceptions were LY-CoV555 monotherapy and LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 combination therapy, both of which lost all protective activity, and the combination of AbbVie 2B04 and 47D11, which showed a partial loss of activity. When administered after infection, higher doses of several mAb cocktails protected in vivo against viruses with a B.1.351 spike gene. Therefore, many-but not all-of the antibody products with Emergency Use Authorization should retain substantial efficacy against the prevailing variant strains of SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3176983361,"Dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease (DIAD) causes predictable biological changes decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, enabling testing of interventions in the asymptomatic and symptomatic stages to delay or slow disease progression. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-arm trial of gantenerumab or solanezumab in participants with DIAD across asymptomatic and symptomatic disease stages. Mutation carriers were assigned 3:1 to either drug or placebo and received treatment for 4–7 years. The primary outcome was a cognitive end point; secondary outcomes included clinical, cognitive, imaging and fluid biomarker measures. Fifty-two participants carrying a mutation were assigned to receive gantenerumab, 52 solanezumab and 40 placebo. Both drugs engaged their Aβ targets but neither demonstrated a beneficial effect on cognitive measures compared to controls. The solanezumab-treated group showed a greater cognitive decline on some measures and did not show benefits on downstream biomarkers. Gantenerumab significantly reduced amyloid plaques, cerebrospinal fluid total tau, and phospho-tau181 and attenuated increases of neurofilament light chain. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities edema was observed in 19.2% (3 out of 11 were mildly symptomatic) of the gantenerumab group, 2.5% of the placebo group and 0% of the solanezumab group. Gantenerumab and solanezumab did not slow cognitive decline in symptomatic DIAD. The asymptomatic groups showed no cognitive decline; symptomatic participants had declined before reaching the target doses. Results from the phase 2/3 clinical trial of gantenerumab or solanezumab in dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease reveal no beneficial effects on cognitive measures despite a significant reduction in amyloid plaques and other key biomarkers in those treated with gantenerumab."
https://openalex.org/W3176060925,"Candida auris is a fungal pathogen of high concern due to its ability to cause healthcare-associated infections and outbreaks, its resistance to antimicrobials and disinfectants and its persistence on human skin and in the inanimate environment. To inform surveillance and future mitigation strategies, we defined the extent of skin colonization and explored the microbiome associated with C. auris colonization. We collected swab specimens and clinical data at three times points between January and April 2019 from 57 residents (up to ten body sites each) of a ventilator-capable skilled nursing facility with endemic C. auris and routine chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bathing. Integrating microbial-genomic and epidemiologic data revealed occult C. auris colonization of multiple body sites not targeted commonly for screening. High concentrations of CHG were associated with suppression of C. auris growth but not with deleterious perturbation of commensal microbes. Modeling human mycobiome dynamics provided insight into underlying alterations to the skin fungal community as a possible modifiable risk factor for acquisition and persistence of C. auris. Failure to detect the extensive, disparate niches of C. auris colonization may reduce the effectiveness of infection-prevention measures that target colonized residents, highlighting the importance of universal strategies to reduce C. auris transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3176619285,"Hypoxia is a key factor responsible for the failure of therapeutic response in most solid tumors and promotes the acquisition of tumor resistance to various antitumor immune effectors. Reshaping the hypoxic immune suppressive tumor microenvironment to improve cancer immunotherapy is still a relevant challenge. We investigated the impact of inhibiting HIF-1α transcriptional activity on cytotoxic immune cell infiltration into B16-F10 melanoma. We showed that tumors expressing a deleted form of HIF-1α displayed increased levels of NK and CD8+ effector T cells in the tumor microenvironment, which was associated with high levels of CCL2 and CCL5 chemokines. We showed that combining acriflavine, reported as a pharmacological agent preventing HIF-1α/HIF-1β dimerization, dramatically improved the benefit of cancer immunotherapy based on TRP-2 peptide vaccination and anti-PD-1 blocking antibody. In melanoma patients, we revealed that tumors exhibiting high CCL5 are less hypoxic, and displayed high NK, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell markers than those having low CCL5. In addition, melanoma patients with high CCL5 in their tumors survive better than those having low CCL5. This study provides the pre-clinical proof of concept for a novel triple combination strategy including blocking HIF-1α transcription activity along vaccination and PD-1 blocking immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3177272482,"Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is an essential chromatin-modifying complex that monoubiquitinates histone H2A and is involved in maintaining the repressed chromatin state. Emerging evidence suggests PRC1 activity in various cancers, rationalizing the need for small-molecule inhibitors with well-defined mechanisms of action. Here, we describe the development of compounds that directly bind to RING1B-BMI1, the heterodimeric complex constituting the E3 ligase activity of PRC1. These compounds block the association of RING1B-BMI1 with chromatin and inhibit H2A ubiquitination. Structural studies demonstrate that these inhibitors bind to RING1B by inducing the formation of a hydrophobic pocket in the RING domain. Our PRC1 inhibitor, RB-3, decreases the global level of H2A ubiquitination and induces differentiation in leukemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. In summary, we demonstrate that targeting the PRC1 RING domain with small molecules is feasible, and RB-3 represents a valuable chemical tool to study PRC1 biology."
https://openalex.org/W3174193297,"Objective Obesity has been reported as a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in recent studies. However, the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and COVID-19 severity and fatality are unclear. Research design and methods This study included 4,141 COVID-19 patients who were released from isolation or had died as of April 30, 2020. This nationwide data was provided by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Agency. BMI was categorized as follows; &lt; 18.5 kg/m 2 , 18.5–22.9 kg/m 2 , 23.0–24.9 kg/m 2 , 25.0–29.9 kg/m 2 , and ≥ 30 kg/m 2 . We defined a fatal illness if the patient had died. Results Among participants, those with a BMI of 18.5–22.9 kg/m 2 were the most common (42.0%), followed by 25.0–29.9 kg/m 2 (24.4%), 23.0–24.9 kg/m 2 (24.3%), ≥ 30 kg/m 2 (4.7%), and &lt; 18.5 kg/m 2 (4.6%). In addition, 1,654 (41.2%) were men and 3.04% were fatalities. Multivariable analysis showed that age, male sex, BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m 2 , BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 , diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and dementia were independent risk factors for fatal illness. In particular, BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m 2 (odds ratio [OR] 3.97, 95% CI 1.77–8.92), 25.0–29.9 kg/m 2 (2.43, 1.32–4.47), and ≥ 30 kg/m 2 (4.32, 1.37–13.61) were found to have higher ORs than the BMI of 23.0–24.9 kg/m 2 (reference). There was no significant difference between those with a BMI of 18.5–22.9 kg/m 2 (1.59, 0.88–2.89) and 23.0–24.9 kg/m 2 . Conclusions This study demonstrated a non-linear (U-shaped) relationship between BMI and fatal illness. Subjects with a BMI of &lt; 18.5 kg/m 2 and those with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 had a high risk of fatal illness. Maintaining a healthy weight is important not only to prevent chronic cardiometabolic diseases, but also to improve the outcome of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3116096443,"Canonical CRISPR–knockout (KO) screens rely on Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to generate targeted gene KOs. These methodologies may yield distorted results because DSB-associated effects are often falsely assumed to be consequences of gene perturbation itself, especially when high copy-number sites are targeted. In the present study, we report a DSB-independent, genome-wide CRISPR screening method, termed iBARed cytosine base editing-mediated gene KO (BARBEKO). This method leverages CRISPR cytosine base editors for genome-scale KO screens by perturbing gene start codons or splice sites, or by introducing premature termination codons. Furthermore, it is integrated with iBAR, a strategy we devised for improving screening quality and efficiency. By constructing such a cell library through lentiviral infection at a high multiplicity of infection (up to 10), we achieved efficient and accurate screening results with substantially reduced starting cells. More importantly, in comparison with Cas9-mediated fitness screens, BARBEKO screens are no longer affected by DNA cleavage-induced cytotoxicity in HeLa-, K562- or DSB-sensitive retinal pigmented epithelial 1 cells. We anticipate that BARBEKO offers a valuable tool to complement the current CRISPR–KO screens in various settings. CRISPR genetic screens with base editors avoid the confounding effects of DNA breaks."
https://openalex.org/W3173936255,"Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) are fundamental to cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels, but it is unclear how they interact with chromatin and activate their target genes. Here, we use genome-wide mutagenesis to identify genes involved in HIF transcriptional activity, and define a requirement for the histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase SET1B. SET1B loss leads to a selective reduction in transcriptional activation of HIF target genes, resulting in impaired cell growth, angiogenesis and tumor establishment in SET1B-deficient xenografts. Mechanistically, we show that SET1B accumulates on chromatin in hypoxia, and is recruited to HIF target genes by the HIF complex. The selective induction of H3K4 trimethylation at HIF target loci is both HIF- and SET1B-dependent and, when impaired, correlates with decreased promoter acetylation and gene expression. Together, these findings show SET1B as a determinant of site-specific histone methylation and provide insight into how HIF target genes are differentially regulated. The histone H3K4 methyltransferase SET1B is recruited to a subset of hypoxia-inducible genes by the HIF complex. Loss of SET1B reduces HIF transcriptional activity in hypoxia and impairs tumor formation in xenograft models."

https://openalex.org/W3175220249,"The moth pest fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is now present throughout much of the Eastern Hemisphere where it poses a significant economic threat to a number of crops. Native to the Western Hemisphere, fall armyworm is one of the primary pests of corn in the Americas and periodically causes significant economic damage to sorghum, millet, cotton, rice, and forage grasses. This broad host range is in part the result of two populations historically designated as host strains (C-strain and R-strain) that differ in their host plant preferences. Reports of infestations in Africa have to date mostly been limited to the C-strain preferred crops of corn and sorghum, with little evidence of an R-strain presence. However, this could reflect a bias in monitoring intensity, with the R-strain perhaps being more prevalent in other crop systems that have not been as routinely examined for the pest. Because knowledge of whether and to what extent both strains are present is critical to assessments of crops at immediate risk, we analyzed specimens obtained from a systematic survey of pasture grass and rice fields, habitats typically preferred by the R-strain, done contemporaneously with collections from corn fields in Ghana and Togo. Substantial larval infestations were only observed in corn, while pheromone trap capture numbers were high only in corn and rice habitats. Little to no fall armyworm were found in the pasture setting. Comparisons with a meta-analysis of studies from South America identified differences in the pattern of strain-specific markers typically found in fall armyworm collected from rice habitats between the two hemispheres. Genetic tests of specimens from rice and corn area traps failed to show evidence of differential mating between strains. These results are consistent with the R-strain being rare or even absent in Africa and, at least for the Ghana-Togo area, this R-strain lack does not appear to be due to limitations in pest monitoring. The implications of these results to the crops at risk in Africa and the accuracy of existing molecular markers of strain identity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3177307576,"The use of smartphones, tablets and laptops/PCs has become ingrained in adults' and increasingly in children's lives, which has sparked a debate about the risk of addiction to digital devices. Previous research has linked specific use of digital devices (e.g. online gaming, smartphone screen time) with impulsive behavior in the context of intertemporal choice among adolescents and adults. However, not much is known about children's addictive behavior towards digital devices and its relationship to personality factors and academic performance. This study investigated the associations between addictive use of digital devices, self-reported usage duration, delay discounting, self-control and academic success in children aged 10 to 13. Addictive use of digital devices was positively related to delay discounting, but self-control confounded the relationship between the two variables. Furthermore, self-control and self-reported usage duration but not the degree of addictive use predicted the most recent grade average. These findings indicate that children's problematic behavior towards digital devices compares to other maladaptive behaviors (e.g. substance abuse, pathological gambling) in terms of impulsive choice and point towards the key role self-control seems to play in lowering a potential risk of digital addiction."

https://openalex.org/W3176855987,"The ability to tune RNA and gene expression dynamics is greatly needed for biotechnological applications. Native RNA stabilizers or engineered 5′ stability hairpins have been used to regulate transcript half-life to control recombinant protein expression. However, these methods have been mostly ad hoc and hence lack predictability and modularity. Here, we report a library of RNA modules called degradation-tuning RNAs (dtRNAs) that can increase or decrease transcript stability in vivo and in vitro. dtRNAs enable modulation of transcript stability over a 40-fold dynamic range in Escherichia coli with minimal influence on translation initiation. We harness dtRNAs in messenger RNAs and noncoding RNAs to tune gene circuit dynamics and enhance CRISPR interference in vivo. Use of stabilizing dtRNAs in cell-free transcription-translation reactions also tunes gene and RNA aptamer production. Finally, we combine dtRNAs with toehold switch sensors to enhance the performance of paper-based norovirus diagnostics, illustrating the potential of dtRNAs for biotechnological applications. Degradation-tuning RNAs (dtRNAs) have the capacity to increase and decrease RNA stability in vivo and in vitro. Appending these modules to transcripts allows fine tuning of circuit dynamics, CRISPR interference and paper-based viral diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W3173714210,"Background As a consequence of stay-at-home and other lockdown measures, such as social distancing, all health care service provisions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been affected, including the provision of speech therapy. Telehealth services can play a major role in maintaining access to health care, help speech and language pathologists (SLPs) overcome physical barriers by providing patients and caregivers with access to health care, and limit the discontinuity of patient care. To have a better understanding of the changes that have occurred in these services during COVID-19, this research was conducted to explore the nature and current situation of speech-language services in Saudi Arabia based on caregivers’ perspectives. It also investigated whether changes have occurred in these services during the COVID-19 lockdown. The study also determined the perception of caregivers in delivering SLS sessions remotely. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted with 385 caregivers in Saudi Arabia. An online survey asked whether children were experiencing any SLS problems and if they had received any intervention. The survey also assessed the perception of changes in service during the COVID-19 lockdown and the perceptions, acceptance, and willingness of the caregivers to deliver telehealth speech services in Saudi Arabia. Results About 50% of the respondents had or were suspected to have a child with SLS problems, and just over half of them had accessed SLS services. Most of the respondents reported suspension of therapy sessions as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the respondents had little experience using telehealth prior to the pandemic, they generally showed a willingness to use telehealth in therapy sessions, expressing a preference for video calls over other options. Conclusion The study revealed that SLS services in Saudi Arabia are limited and that accessing these services is challenging. Alternative service delivery using remote services could help caregivers overcome such challenges. When telehealth was introduced as an option for service delivery, the caregivers showed welcoming responses, particularly with video calls."
https://openalex.org/W3174566325,"Allele frequencies and haplotype frequencies of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DRB3/4/5, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1, and -DPB1 have been rarely reported in South Koreans using unambiguous, phase-resolved next generation DNA sequencing. In this study, HLA typing of 11 loci in 173 healthy South Koreans were performed using next generation DNA sequencing with long-range PCR, TruSight® HLA v2 kit, Illumina MiSeqDx platform system, and Assign™ for TruSight™ HLA software. Haplotype frequencies were calculated using the PyPop software. Direct counting methods were used to investigate the association with DRB1 for samples with only one copy of a particular secondary DRB locus. We compared these allele types with the ambiguous allele combinations of the IPD-IMGT/HLA database. We identified 20, 40, 26, 31, 19, 16, 4, and 16 alleles of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1, and HLA-DPB1, respectively. The number of HLA-DRB3/4/5 alleles was 4, 5, and 3, respectively. The haplotype frequencies of most common haplotypes were as follows: A*33:03:01-B*44:03:01-C*14:03-DRB1*13:02:01-DQB1*06:04:01-DPB1*04:01:01 (2.89%), A*33:03:01-B*44:03:01-C*14:03 (4.91%), DRB1*08:03:02-DQA1*01:03:01-DQB1*06:01:01-DPA1*02:02:02-DPB1*05:01:01 (5.41%), DRB1*04:05:01-DRB4*01:03:01 (12.72%), DQA1*01:03:01-DQB1*06:01:01 (13.01%), and DPA1*02:02:02-DPB1*05:01:01 (30.83%). In samples with only one copy of a specific secondary DRB locus, we examined its association with DRB1. We, thus, resolved 10 allele ambiguities in HLA-B, -C (each exon 2+3), -DRB1, -DQB1, -DQA1, and -DPB1 (each exon 2) of the IPD-IMGT/HLA database. Korean population was geographically close to Japanese and Han Chinese populations in the genetic distances by multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots. The information obtained by HLA typing of the 11 extended loci by next generation sequencing may be useful for more exact diagnostic tests on various transplantations and the genetic population relationship studies in South Koreans."
https://openalex.org/W3175824771,"The Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration is the leading and demonstration area for the high-quality development of culture tourism (HDCT) in China. It is of great significance to study the spatiotemporal characteristics and impact mechanism of the HDCT for revealing the internal law of HDCT and promoting the collaborative innovation of culture tourism among cities. Based on the scientific construction of the evaluation system of HDCT, this paper made a quantitative analysis of 26 cities’ HDCT by using coupling coordination degree model, Lisa spatiotemporal transition and spatial Durbin model (SDM). The results show that: The overall level of 26 cities’ HDCT shows a fluctuating upward trend, and presents a ""Z"" pattern in space. More than 80% of the cities are at the medium and high level. Shanghai has obvious advantages in the primacy degree. There is a significant positive spatial autocorrelation among cities with high-quality of culture tourism development. The spatial clustering and proximity of the same kind are increasing, and the radiation effect is gradually obvious. The local spatial association patterns are mainly HH and LL agglomeration, and the characteristics of polarization are gradually prominent. The local spatial correlation structure of HDCT has strong stability, the transfer inertia between types is prominent, and the overall spatial evolution is lack of integration with obvious path dependence and lock-in effect. The spatiotemporal evolution of the HDCT is a complex process under the interaction of multiple factors, and there is a significant spatial spillover effect (0.256). The level of economic development, technological innovation, professional talent allocation are the three main factors. According to the dominant factor, it can be divided into economy stabilizing type, industry optimizing type, innovation driving type and traffic impacting type. These findings have implications for local governments and tourism management departments to achieve high-quality innovative development of cultural tourism."
https://openalex.org/W3176357545,"Technologies have become important for interaction in couples. However, in some cases, controlling and aggressive behaviors can occur in the context of virtual interactions in couples; this is known as cyber-dating abuse (CDA). Identifying factors linked to CDA, as perpetrator and victim, are relevant for its prevention; therefore, more research is needed in this novel field of study. To contribute to the literature, our first goal was to analyze the associations among certain risk factors for CDA perpetration and victimization of, i.e., sexist attitudes and violence justification, problematic smartphone usage and impulsivity; sex and age were also considered. The second goal was to study whether there were differences in direct aggression and control, from the perpetrator and victim perspectives, with consideration of the above-mentioned risk factors. Third, differences in the diverse range of control behaviors and direct aggression between women and men were explored. To this end, 697 young adults (aged between 18 and 35 years; 548 women) completed self-report questionnaires that allowed assessment of the above-mentioned variables. The results showed that, among the wide range of CDA behaviors, indirect ones such as control behaviors were the most common. The highest level of control was strongly associated with the inability to manage behaviors under certain emotional states, especially negative ones, along with problematic smartphone usage. Sex differences were also observed: men displayed more sexist attitudes and violence justification, and perceived that they were more controlled by their partners. Regarding CDA behaviors, men and women showed differences in control (e.g. men considered themselves to be more controlled in terms of location and status updates), and direct aggression (e.g. men used more insults and humiliations than women). The results were discussed in terms of the importance of better understanding these risk factors to attenuate the increasing prevalence of CDA in relationships."

The mechanism underlying the transgenerational inheritance of perinatal smoke/nicotine-induced asthma remains unknown, but germline epigenetic modulations may play a role. Using a well-established rat model of perinatal nicotine-induced asthma, we determined the DNA methylation pattern of spermatozoa of F1 rats exposed perinatally to nicotine in F0 gestation. To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was performed on spermatozoa of F1 litters. The top regulated gene body and promoter DMRs were tested for lung gene expression levels, and key proteins involved in lung development and repair were determined. The overall CpG methylation in F1 sperms across gene bodies, promoters, 5'-UTRs, exons, introns, and 3'-UTRs was not affected by nicotine exposure. However, the methylation levels were different between the different genomic regions. Eighty one CpG sites, 16 gene bodies, and 3 promoter regions were differentially methylated. Gene enrichment analysis of DMRs revealed pathways involved in oxidative stress, nicotine response, alveolar and brain development, and cellular signaling. Among the DMRs, Dio1 and Nmu were the most hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes, respectively. Gene expression analysis showed that the mRNA expression and DNA methylation were incongruous. Key proteins involved in lung development and repair were significantly different (FDR < 0.05) between the nicotine and placebo-treated groups. Our data show that DNA methylation is remodeled in offspring spermatozoa upon perinatal nicotine exposure. These epigenetic alterations may play a role in transgenerational inheritance of perinatal smoke/nicotine induced asthma."
https://openalex.org/W3175039143,"The red squat lobster Pleuroncodes monodon is a species of high commercial value that inhabits the Humboldt Current System. Along the Chilean coast, two populations are exploited by the fishing industry, one located off the coast of Coquimbo and the other off the coast of Concepción. Yet, it is unknown whether there are differences in the ""bioenergetic fuel"" (measured as lipid content and fatty acid profile) of juvenile populations of these two fishing units and whether these bioenergetic compounds can be modulated by differences in the environmental parameters (such as temperature or chlorophyll-a) of their breeding areas. To shed some light on this, we measured the lipid content and fatty acid profiles of the viscera and muscle of juvenile female red squat lobsters from these two fishing units, specifically from breeding areas near long-exploited fishing grounds: a) the northern fishing unit (NFU, from 26°S to 30°S) and b) the southern fishing unit (SFU, from 32°S to 37°S). We found differences in the lipid content, fatty acid profiles, and ratios of saturated fatty acids (C16:0/C18:0) of juvenile females from these two locations. In addition, the essential fatty acids (DHA/EPA) found in the viscera versus the muscle of these lobsters varied significantly. Juvenile females from the SFU (i.e. Concepción) showed a higher lipid content compared to the juvenile females from the NFU (i.e. Coquimbo). Consistently, individuals from the SFU had a higher content of fatty acids, which also proved to be richer in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids compared to those from the NFU. Our results are important for the fisheries in both areas because these juvenile populations are the source of new recruits for the adult populations that are exploited by the fishing industry. Our study also aids in determining which populations are healthier or of better quality in bioenergetic terms. Furthermore, increasing the incorporation of bioenergetic parameters in fishery models is essential for the recruitment and stock assessment within an ecosystem approach, since it allows for the evaluation of the nutritional condition of different fishing populations."
https://openalex.org/W3174453752,"Background The World Health Organization (WHO)-defined radiological pneumonia is a preferred endpoint in pneumococcal vaccine efficacy and effectiveness studies in children. Automating the WHO methodology may support more widespread application of this endpoint. Methods We trained a deep learning model to classify pneumonia CXRs in children using the World Health Organization (WHO)’s standardized methodology. The model was pretrained on CheXpert, a dataset containing 224,316 adult CXRs, and fine-tuned on PERCH, a pediatric dataset containing 4,172 CXRs. The model was then tested on two pediatric CXR datasets released by WHO. We also compared the model’s performance to that of radiologists and pediatricians. Results The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for primary endpoint pneumonia (PEP) across 10-fold validation of PERCH images was 0.928; average AUC after testing on WHO images was 0.977. The model’s classification performance was better on test images with high inter-observer agreement; however, the model still outperformed human assessments in AUC and precision-recall spaces on low agreement images. Conclusion A deep learning model can classify pneumonia CXR images in children at a performance comparable to human readers. Our method lays a strong foundation for the potential inclusion of computer-aided readings of pediatric CXRs in vaccine trials and epidemiology studies."
https://openalex.org/W3173974368,"Abstract The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been widely used for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but the development of acquired resistance remains a therapeutic hurdle. The reduction of glucose uptake has been implicated in the anti-tumor activity of EGFR TKIs. In this study, the upregulation of the active sodium/glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) was found to confer the development of acquired EGFR TKI resistance and was correlated with the poorer clinical outcome of the NSCLC patients who received EGFR TKI treatment. Blockade of SGLT1 overcame this resistance in vitro and in vivo by reducing glucose uptake in NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, SGLT1 protein was stabilized through the interaction with PKCδ-phosphorylated (Thr678) EGFR in the TKI-resistant cells. Our findings revealed that PKCδ/EGFR axis-dependent SGLT1 upregulation was a critical mechanism underlying the acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. We suggest co-targeting PKCδ/SGLT1 as a potential strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR TKIs in NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3176660854,"Inadequate and unequal distribution of health workers are significant barriers to provision of health services in Malawi, and challenges retaining health workers in rural areas have limited scale-up initiatives. This study therefore aims to estimate cost-effectiveness of monetary and non-monetary strategies in attracting and retaining nurse midwife technicians (NMTs) to rural areas of Malawi.The study uses a discrete choice experiment (DCE) methodology to investigate importance of job characteristics, probability of uptake, and intervention costs. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with NMTs and students to identify recruitment and retention motivating factors. Through policymaker consultations, qualitative findings were used to identify job attributes for the DCE questionnaire, administered to 472 respondents. A conditional logit regression model was developed to produce probability of choosing a job with different attributes and an uptake rate was calculated to estimate the percentage of health workers that would prefer jobs with specific intervention packages. Attributes were costed per health worker year.Qualitative results highlighted housing, facility quality, management, and workload as important factors in job selection. Respondents were 2.04 times as likely to choose a rural job if superior housing was provided compared to no housing (CI 1.71-2.44, p<0.01), and 1.70 times as likely to choose a rural job with advanced facility quality (CI 1.47-1.96, p<0.01). At base level 43.9% of respondents would choose a rural job. This increased to 61.5% if superior housing was provided, and 72.5% if all facility-level improvements were provided, compared to an urban job without these improvements. Facility-level interventions had the lowest cost per health worker year.Our results indicate housing and facility-level improvements have the greatest impact on rural job choice, while also creating longer-term improvements to health workers' living and working environments. These results provide practical evidence for policymakers to support development of workforce recruitment and retention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3177477682,"For patients with anaplastic Wilms tumor (WiT), metastasis and recurrence are common, and prognosis is generally poor. Novel therapies are needed to improve outcomes for patients with this high-risk WiT. A potential contributor to WiT development is constitutive activation of AKT by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway, but the complete underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)-IGF binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) axis and the tumor-specific IGF1A are key players for constitutive activation of IGF1-AKT signaling leading to the tumor malignancy. HIF-1α and IGFBP2 are highly expressed in a majority of WiT patient samples. Deficiency of either HIF-1α or IGFBP2 or IGF1 in the tumor cells significantly impairs tumor growth and nearly abrogates metastasis in xenografted mice. Pharmacologic targeting of HIF-1α by echinomycin delivered via nanoliposomes can efficiently restrain growth and metastasis of patient-derived relapsed anaplastic WiT xenografts. Liposomal echinomycin is more potent and effective in inhibiting WiT growth than vincristine in an anaplastic WiT mouse model, and eliminates metastasis by suppressing HIF-1α targets and the HIF-1α-IGFBP2 axis, which governs IGF1-AKT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3177292614,"Reservoir facies modeling is an important way to express the sedimentary characteristics of the target area. Conventional deterministic modeling, target-based stochastic simulation, and two-point geostatistical stochastic modeling methods are difficult to characterize the complex sedimentary microfacies structure. Multi-point geostatistics (MPG) method can learn a priori geological model and can realize multi-point correlation simulation in space, while deep neural network can express nonlinear relationship well. This article comprehensively utilizes the advantages of the two to try to optimize the multi-point geostatistical reservoir facies modeling algorithm based on the Deep Forward Neural Network (DFNN). Through the optimization design of the multi-grid training data organization form and repeated simulation of grid nodes, the simulation results of diverse modeling algorithm parameters, data conditions and deposition types of sedimentary microfacies models were compared. The results show that by optimizing the organization of multi-grid training data and repeated simulation of nodes, it is easier to obtain a random simulation close to the real target, and the simulation of sedimentary microfacies of different scales and different sedimentary types can be performed."
https://openalex.org/W3173858324,"Rat Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N) is an animal model of human mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), accompanied by glomerular mesangial cell (GMC) proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Although sublytic C5b-9 formed on GMC membrane could induce cell proliferation, the mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we first demonstrated that the level of SRY related HMG-BOX gene 9 (SOX9), general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and platelet-derived growth factor α (PDGFα) was all elevated both in the renal tissues of Thy-1N rats (in vivo) and in the GMCs (in vitro) with sublytic C5b-9 stimulation. Then, we not only discovered that sublytic C5b-9 caused GMC proliferation through increasing SOX9, GCN5, FGF1 and PDGFα expression, but also proved that SOX9 and GCN5 formed a complex and combined with FGF1 and PDGFα promoters, leading to FGF1 and PDGFα gene transcription. More importantly, GCN5 could mediate SOX9 acetylation at lysine 62 (K62) to enhance SOX9 binding to FGF1 or PDGFα promoter and promote FGF1 or PDGFα synthesis and GMC proliferation. Besides, the experiments in vivo also showed that FGF1 and PDGFα expression, GMC proliferation and urinary protein secretion in Thy-1N rats were greatly reduced by silencing renal SOX9, GCN5, FGF1 or PDGFα gene. Furthermore, the renal tissues of MsPGN patients also exhibited positive expression of these genes mentioned above. Collectively, our findings indicate that GCN5, SOX9 and FGF1/PDGFα can form an axis and play an essential role in sublytic C5b-9-triggered GMC proliferation, which might provide a novel insight into the pathogenesis of Thy-1N and MsPGN."
https://openalex.org/W3174040387,"In the oligotrophic tropical marine environment resources are usually more patchily distributed and less abundant to top predators. Thus, spatial and trophic competition can emerge, especially between related seabird species belonging to the same ecological guild. Here we studied the foraging ecology of two sympatric species–brown booby (BRBO) Sula leucogaster (breeding) and red-footed boobies (RFBO) Sula sula (non-breeding)–at Raso islet (Cabo Verde), across different seasons. Sexual segregation was only observed during Jun-Oct, when RFBO were present, with larger females BRBO remaining closer to the colonies, while males and RFBO travelled further and exploited different habitats. Overall, species appeared to prefer areas with specific oceanic features, particularly those related with oceanic currents and responsible for enhancing primary productivity in tropical oceanic areas (e.g. Sea Surface Height and Ocean Mixed Layer Thickness). Female BRBOs showed high foraging-site fidelity during the period of sympatry, while exploiting the same prey species as the other birds. However, during the months of co-existence (Jun.-Oct.), isotopic mixing models suggested that female BRBO would consume a higher proportion of epipelagic fish, whereas female RFBO would consume more squid compared to the other birds, possibly due to habitat-specific prey availability and breeding energy-constraints for BRBO. We conclude that divergent parental roles, environmental conditions, habitat preference and competition could be mechanisms simultaneously underlying sexual segregation for BRBO during a period of co-existence, while inter-specific foraging differences appear to be more affected by habitat preference and different breeding stages. These results support previous statements that BRBO can adapt their foraging ecology to different circumstances of environmental conditions and competition, and that marine physical features play an important role in foraging decisions of boobies."

First, according to the description of occupation in the Chinese Occupation Classification Grand Dictionary, a text similarity algorithm was used to preliminarily choose recruitment data with high similarity. Second, Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification (TextCNN) was used to further classify the preliminary corpus to obtain a precise occupational dataset.

Finally, putting the extracted entities into the occupational dataset, the occupation characteristics of multiple dimensions were depicted to form a profile of the vocation."
https://openalex.org/W3176236970,"Fibrosis is a pronounced feature of heart disease and the result of dysregulated activation of resident cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Recent work identified stress-induced degradation of the cytoskeletal protein βIV-spectrin as an important step in CF activation and cardiac fibrosis. Furthermore, loss of βIV-spectrin was found to depend on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Therefore, we sought to determine the mechanism for CaMKII-dependent regulation of βIV-spectrin and CF activity. Computational screening and MS revealed a critical serine residue (S2250 in mouse and S2254 in human) in βIV-spectrin phosphorylated by CaMKII. Disruption of βIV-spectrin/CaMKII interaction or alanine substitution of βIV-spectrin Ser2250 (βIV-S2254A) prevented CaMKII-induced degradation, whereas a phosphomimetic construct (βIV-spectrin with glutamic acid substitution at serine 2254 [βIV-S2254E]) showed accelerated degradation in the absence of CaMKII. To assess the physiological significance of this phosphorylation event, we expressed exogenous βIV-S2254A and βIV-S2254E constructs in βIV-spectrin-deficient CFs, which have increased proliferation and fibrotic gene expression compared with WT CFs. βIV-S2254A but not βIV-S2254E normalized CF proliferation, gene expression, and contractility. Pathophysiological targeting of βIV-spectrin phosphorylation and subsequent degradation was identified in CFs activated with the profibrotic ligand angiotensin II, resulting in increased proliferation and signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 nuclear accumulation. While therapeutic delivery of exogenous WT βIV-spectrin partially reversed these trends, βIV-S2254A completely negated increased CF proliferation and signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 translocation. Moreover, we observed βIV-spectrin phosphorylation and associated loss in total protein within human heart tissue following heart failure. Together, these data illustrate a considerable role for the βIV-spectrin/CaMKII interaction in activating profibrotic signaling.

Increased fibrosis, characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, is a critical component of the repair and remodeling response to chronic neurohumoral or biomechanical stress in tissues throughout the body, including heart, lung, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, and skin (1Lynch M.D. Watt F.M. Fibroblast heterogeneity: Implications for human disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In heart, fibrosis is not only important for replacement of damaged/dead myocardium in response to ischemic injury but also promotes electrical and mechanical dysfunction in a wide range of cardiac diseases (2Gourdie R.G. Dimmeler S. Kohl P. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting fibroblasts and fibrosis in heart disease.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2016; 15: 620-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Travers J.G.

Fibroblasts in the infarcted, remodeling, and failing heart.JACC Basic Transl. Sci. 2019; 4: 449-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the underlying cell types responsible for fibrotic remodeling. Under baseline (nondiseased) conditions, CFs play an essential supportive role in maintaining ECM homeostasis. Following injury, however, CFs undergo a transition from their basal state to an activated phenotype, characterized by enhanced proliferation, migration, and ECM deposition leading to increased fibrosis (5Kong P. Christia P. Frangogiannis N.G. The pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71: 549-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Importantly, a diverse array of signaling events, including neurohumoral, biomechanical, and paracrine factors, has been identified in the CF activation process (3Travers J.G. Kamal F.A. Robbins J.

Res. 2016; 118: 1021-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), providing opportunities for therapeutic strategies aimed at convergent molecular targets shared among these numerous signaling cascades. Spectrins are a family of proteins initially identified for their role in providing structural support to cellular membranes (6Bennett V. Baines A.J.

Selective solubilization of a protein component of the red cell membrane.Science. 1968; 159: 203-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The family includes two α- and five β-spectrin gene products where dimers of α- and β-spectrin interact with one another to form heterotetramers to facilitate interaction of membrane proteins with the actin cytoskeleton (8Hashemi S.M.

Since their discovery, our understanding of spectrin function has grown to include critical spatiotemporal regulation of cell signaling events (9Unudurthi S.D. Greer-Short A. Patel N. Nassal D.

Importantly, novel roles for the βIV-spectrin isoform have been discovered in organizing local signaling domains important for stress-induced cardiac remodeling, including arrhythmia and fibrosis (10Hund T.J.

Hund T.J. βIV-spectrin/STAT3 complex regulates fibroblast phenotype, fibrosis, and cardiac function.JCI Insight. 2019; 4e131046Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Specifically, βIV-spectrin targets a subpopulation of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to the cardiac myocyte intercalated disc membrane for regulation of voltage-gated Na+ channels. More recently, a broader role for βIV-spectrin/CaMKII has been identified in regulating gene programs in both cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts through interaction with the signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) (12Unudurthi S.D.

Hund T.J. βIV-spectrin/STAT3 complex regulates fibroblast phenotype, fibrosis, and cardiac function.JCI Insight. 2019; 4e131046Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Importantly, βIV-spectrin sequesters STAT3 near the membrane and out of the nucleus under basal (unstimulated) conditions. CaMKII activation in response to long-term pacing in vitro or chronic pressure overload in vivo promotes loss of βIV-spectrin and redistribution of STAT3 with nuclear accumulation, ultimately leading to changes in gene expression. Here, we tested the hypothesis that βIV-spectrin is a novel target for direct CaMKII phosphorylation with effects on stability/expression of βIV-spectrin. Moreover, given the identified role for CaMKII in regulating cardiac fibrosis, we sought to explore involvement of the βIV-spectrin/CaMKII/STAT3 regulatory nexus in modulating CF gene expression and phenotypes. Using MS guided by a computational screen for consensus motifs, a putative CaMKII phosphorylation site was identified in the βIV-spectrin C terminus (Ser2250 in mouse and Ser2254 in human). Heterologous expression of human βIV-spectrin constructs lacking the putative site (βIV-spectrin with alanine substitution at serine 2254 [βIV-S2254A]) or mimicking constitutive phosphorylation (βIV-spectrin with glutamic acid substitution at serine 2254 [βIV-S2254E]) demonstrated a significance for this site in modulating the rate of βIV-spectrin degradation in vitro. Adenoviral expression of WT and mutant βIV-spectrin constructs in isolated mouse CFs further illustrated the importance for βIV-spectrin phosphorylation in regulating spectrin stability, STAT3 localization, gene expression, cell proliferation, and contractility in genetic models of spectrin deficiency and in response to angiotensin II (AngII). Finally, using a novel custom phospho-specific βIV-spectrin antibody, we identified increased βIV-spectrin phosphorylation at Ser2254 in human failing hearts, supporting an important role for this molecular pathway in human disease. These data advance our understanding of the dynamic range of βIV-spectrin function, including orchestration of its own degradation in response to chronic stress with coordinate changes in gene expression and cell function. Previous results revealed that chronic pressure overload induced prominent loss of βIV-spectrin in WT mice. However, mutant mice expressing truncated βIV-spectrin lacking an identified CaMKII interaction motif (mutant βIV-spectrin allele C-terminal region containing CaMKII interaction motif [qv3J] allele) resulted in maintained βIV-spectrin protein expression (12Unudurthi S.D. Nassal D. Greer-Short A. Patel N. Howard T. Xu X. Onal B. Satroplus T. Hong D. Lane C. Dalic A. Koenig S.N. Lehnig A.C. Baer L.A. Musa H. et al.βIV-spectrin regulates STAT3 targeting to tune cardiac response to pressure overload.J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that rapid pacing of WT myocytes under hyperphosphorylating conditions recapitulated loss of βIV-spectrin observed in vivo, which was prevented by the CaMKII inhibitor autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide as well as when using qv3J myocytes (12Unudurthi S.D. Nassal D. Greer-Short A. Patel N. Howard T. Xu X. Onal B. Satroplus T. Hong D. Lane C. Dalic A. Koenig S.N. Lehnig A.C. Baer L.A. Musa H. et al.βIV-spectrin regulates STAT3 targeting to tune cardiac response to pressure overload.J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we hypothesized that CaMKII directly phosphorylates βIV-spectrin to induce degradation in response to stress. Initial bioinformatics screening of the fragment absent in the qv3J βIV-spectrin allele revealed several putative CaMKII phosphorylation motifs found in both mouse and human, including serine residues 2250, 2268, 2301, 2435, and 2557 (2254, 2272, 2305, 2438, and 2560 in human) (Fig. 1A). Notably, Ser2250/2254 received the highest score as a predicted phosphorylation target (residue highlighted in red, Fig. 1A). We next performed MS analysis on immunoprecipitated βIV-spectrin derived from COS-7 cell lysates transfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged versions of mouse or human βIV-spectrin encoding spectrin repeats 10 through the C terminus. These constructs were coexpressed with or without constitutively active CaMKII. Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated tryptic peptide fragments were identified corresponding to βIV-spectrin residues 2247 to 2259 in mouse (mβIV,2247–2259) and residues 2251 to 2263 in human (hβIV,2251–2263) (associated tandem MS/MS [MS/MS] spectra are shown in Fig. 1B, Table S1). The percentage of phosphorylated mβIV,2247–2259 (out of total detected mβIV,2247–2259) increased from 0% in the absence of CaMKII to 36.2% when coexpressed with CaMKII. A similar effect was observed for the human sequence with an increase in phosphorylated hβIV,2251–2263 from 15.9% to 48.3% in the absence and presence of CaMKII, respectively (Fig. 1D). Notably, human βIV-spectrin achieved higher percentages of phosphorylated peptide at both baseline and in response to constitutively active CaMKII coexpression, suggesting that differences in steady-state levels of phosphorylation may exist between mouse and human βIV-spectrin. Importantly, the identified fragment and corresponding phosphorylation site (Ser2250 in the mouse and Ser2254 in human) are highly conserved across species (Fig. 1E), supporting the physiological significance. MS/MS spectra were unable to detect peptide fragments for the other remaining predicted CaMKII target motifs, preventing assessment of potential phosphorylation of additional sites. Based on our MS results, we generated a rabbit affinity-purified polyclonal antibody for detection of phosphorylated βIV-spectrin Ser2250/2254. The antibody was tested by immunoblot on lysates generated from COS-7 cells transfected with human βIV-spectrin encoding repeats 10 through the C terminus (WT βIV-spectrin) alone, WT βIV-spectrin with constitutively active CaMKII, or a phosphoablated βIV-spectrin derived from the WT βIV-spectrin construct utilizing a serine to alanine mutation at residue 2254 (βIV-S2254A) and coexpressed with constitutively active CaMKII. Increased immunoreactive signal was observed with CaMKII coexpressed with WT βIV-spectrin but not βIV-S2254A (Fig. 2, A and B). In order to more thoroughly evaluate antibody specificity, preadsorption with the antigenic peptide used in antibody generation and affinity purification was performed. As expected, this resulted in the complete loss of signal when treated with the phosphorylated peptide (Fig. S1A). Further antibody characterization was performed by pretreatment of the membrane with alkaline phosphatase to eliminate immunoreactive signal corresponding to phosphorylation of βIV-spectrin. This resulted in signal loss for both WT βIV-spectrin alone (identified to have basal phosphorylation status in MS data; Fig. 1A) and WT βIV-spectrin with CaMKII but marginal loss for βIV-S2254A with CaMKII (Fig. S1, B and C). It is important to note that all validation experiments indicate some degree of crossreactivity with unphosphorylated epitopes. Treatment with the unmodified antigenic peptide also resulted in partial reduction of signal for all evaluated conditions, suggesting partial reactivity with unphosphorylated βIV-spectrin protein. Also, residual immunoreactive signal was apparent in cells expressing βIV-S2254A + CaMKII and in samples pretreated with alkaline phosphatase. Together, these data support the importance of including appropriate controls (i.e., normalization to total βIV-spectrin immunoreactive signal) when using the antibody. That said, these data support the ability of the antibody to detect phosphorylation of βIV-spectrin at S2254. We next tested the hypothesis that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of βIV-spectrin modulates spectrin stability/expression. We cotransfected COS-7 cells with constitutively active CaMKII and the WT and βIV-S2254A constructs. We also included a qv3J construct lacking the C-terminal region containing CaMKII binding and phosphorylation site (starting at spectrin repeat 10 as the case for WT and βIV-S2254A). Cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) 48 h post-transfection to stop new protein synthesis, allowing for assessment of potential differences in protein degradation. Lysates were collected at baseline, as well as 1 and 2 h post-CHX treatment to evaluate the rate of βIV-spectrin loss. WT βIV-spectrin levels (expressed as percentage of baseline expression) were significantly lower 2 h post-CHX treatment compared with qv3J or βIV-S2254A (Fig. 2, C and D), without dramatic changes at longer time points (up to 24 h, data not shown). Notably, there was no difference in relative βIV-S2254A and qv3J expression at 2 h post-CHX. Given that MS results were unable to detect coverage of the other predicted phosphorylation sites (S2272, S2305, S2438, and S2560), a series of phosphoablated mutants were generated to similarly test their functional significance in regulating βIV-spectrin loss. Coexpression of these additional mutants with constitutively active CaMKII led to no change in the rate of βIV-spectrin loss compared with WT (Fig. S2), reinforcing a central role for Ser2254.To subsequently determine whether phosphorylation of Ser2254 was sufficient to induce spectrin degradation, COS-7 cells were transfected with phoshomimetic βIV-spectrin (βIV-S2254E) or WT constructs in the absence of constitutively active CaMKII (GFP cotransfected with βIV-spectrin instead as the cotransfected control). Following treatment with CHX, we again assessed levels of βIV-spectrin expression, which identified a significant loss of spectrin with the βIV-S2254E but not WT construct, even in the absence of CaMKII coexpression (Fig. 3, A and B). Together, these data support an important role for Ser2254 phosphorylation in modulating stability/expression of βIV-spectrin. CFs isolated from βIV-spectrin–deficient mice (mutant βIV-spectrin allele lacking repeats 10 through C terminus [qv4J] mice expressing truncated βIV-spectrin lacking repeats 10 through the C terminus) were previously shown to have enhanced expression of profibrotic genes, increased proliferation, increased contractility, and associated in vivo fibrosis compared with WT animals (13Patel N.J. Nassal D.M. Greer-Short A.D. Unudurthi S.D. Scandling B.W. Gratz D. Xu X. Kalyanasundaram A. Fedorov V.V. Accornero F. Mohler P.J. Gooch K.J. Hund T.J. βIV-spectrin/STAT3 complex regulates fibroblast phenotype, fibrosis, and cardiac function.JCI Insight. 2019; 4e131046Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, as a first step in assessing the potential physiological significance of βIV-spectrin phosphorylation at S2254, we evaluated CF phenotype in qv4J CFs, as a model for βIV-spectrin deficiency. qv4J CFs were subjected to adenoviral expression of human phosphoablated (Ad.βIV-S2254A) or phosphomimetic (Ad.βIV-S2254E) βIV-spectrin or control (Ad.GFP) (Fig. 4A). Mouse and human βIV-spectrin share 96% sequence homology, supporting use of human constructs in mouse CFs. Importantly, qv4J CFs expressing Ad.βIV-S2254A showed a significant reduction in proliferation at both 48 and 72 h post-transduction compared with Ad.βIV-S2254E or control (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, delivery of Ad.βIV-S2254A significantly reduced CF contractility in relation to Ad.βIV-S2254E or Ad.GFP treated cells, as assessed by collagen gel volume compaction (Fig. 4, D and E) as another functional readout for profibrotic activity. At the same time, a significant reduction in select profibrotic genes was observed in Ad.βIV-S2254A expressing CFs compared with Ad.βIV-S2254E or control (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, while CFs expressing Ad.βIV-S2254E showed a similar proliferation rate compared with control, they had significant enhancement of profibrotic gene expression. This change in fibrotic gene expression was specific to the recognized βIV-spectrin/STAT3 pathway, as evaluation of additional fibrosis-associated genes (pdgfra, postn, and vim) previously shown to be unaffected by βIV-spectrin/STAT3 (13Patel N.J.

To ensure that observed phenotypic changes with expression of βIV-spectrin constructs were not an artifact of the qv4J model (expression of truncated βIV-spectrin), we repeated a subset of experiments using our fibroblast-specific βIV-spectrin model utilizing a periostinMerCreMer crossed with βIV-spectrin–floxed mice (inducible fibroblast-specific βIV-spectrin knockout mouse [βIVifKO]) (Fig. S4A) (13Patel N.J.

Hund T.J. βIV-spectrin/STAT3 complex regulates fibroblast phenotype, fibrosis, and cardiac function.JCI Insight. 2019; 4e131046Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Periostin expression is highly specific to activated CFs and can be induced with AngII. Therefore, βIVifKO and control (βIV-floxed, Cre−) mice were treated for 7 days with tamoxifen/AngII for activation of the MerCreMer periostin promoter to induce βIV-spectrin KO in CFs (Fig. S4, A and B), as previously described (13Patel N.J. Nassal D.M. Greer-Short A.D. Unudurthi S.D. Scandling B.W. Gratz D. Xu X. Kalyanasundaram A. Fedorov V.V. Accornero F. Mohler P.J. Gooch K.J. Hund T.J. βIV-spectrin/STAT3 complex regulates fibroblast phenotype, fibrosis, and cardiac function.JCI Insight. 2019; 4e131046Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). CFs isolated from βIVifKO mice were then transduced with Ad.βIV-S2254A, Ad.βIV-S2254E, or Ad.GFP. Consistent with the phenotype observed in the qv4J-derived CFs, Ad.βIV-S2254A treatment reduced contractility (as assessed by collagen gel compaction) compared with Ad.βIV-S2254E and Ad.GFP treated cells. Collectively, these data support a functional role for the phosphorylation of βIV-spectrin at S2254 in its ability to regulate CF gene expression and profibrotic activity. βIV-spectrin alters CF gene expression by controlling subcellular localization of the transcription factor STAT3 through physical interaction and sequestration at the membrane (12Unudurthi S.D.

Notably, conditions of βIV-spectrin loss through genetic or acquired means untethers STAT3, resulting in greater nuclear expression and transcriptional activity. To determine whether phosphorylation of βIV-spectrin at S2254, and subsequent changes in βIV-spectrin stability, altered STAT3 localization, immunostaining was performed on qv4J CFs expressing Ad.βIV-S2254A, Ad.βIV-S2254E, or Ad.GFP. Consistent with previous observations, control (Ad.GFP) qv4J CFs displayed prominent nuclear localization of STAT3 because of the absence of STAT3/βIV-spectrin binding in the qv4J allele (Fig. 4, F and G). Expression of Ad.βIV-S2254A but not Ad.βIV-S2254E in qv4J CFs significantly reduced the relative amount of STAT3 in the nucleus compared with control, consistent with proliferation, gene expression, and compaction assay results. Interestingly, Ad.βIV-S2254A was colocalized with STAT3 in a diffuse and perinuclear pattern, whereas Ad.βIV-S2254E showed a distinct punctate pattern (Fig. 4F). Beyond genetic models of βIV-spectrin deficiency (qv4J and βIVifKO), we sought to test whether βIV-spectrin phosphorylation at Ser2250/2254 influenced CF phenotype under pathophysiological stress conditions involving AngII treatment, which alters CF phenotype (including increased proliferation) in part through activation of CaMKII (14Peng J.F.

CFs treated with AngII (1 μM) showed an increase in phosphorylated βIV-spectrin (expressed as fraction of total) with an overall decrease in total βIV-spectrin expression (Fig. 5, A–C). To determine whether phosphorylation of βIV-spectrin regulated the CF functional response to AngII, WT CFs were transduced with Ad.βIV-WT, Ad.βIV-S2254A, or Ad.GFP prior to treatment with AngII. Consistent with immunoblot data, AngII treatment led to a loss in βIV-spectrin signal in Ad.GFP-expressing CFs (Fig. 5D), together with a significant increase in STAT3 nuclear signal and increased proliferation compared with Ad.GFP-expressing CFs (Fig. 5, D–G). Expression of Ad.βIV-WT significantly reduced AngII-induced translocation of STAT3 into the nucleus and reduced the proliferation rate compared with Ad.GFP-expressing CFs. Interestingly, Ad.βIV-S2254A-expressing CFs were resistant to AngII-induced STAT3 nuclear accumulation with levels comparable to untreated Ad.GFP-expressing CFs (Fig. 5, D and F). Similarly, Ad.βIV-S2254A-expressing CFs treated with AngII showed a similar proliferation rate to untreated Ad.GFP CFs. Together, these studies establish a link between βIV-spectrin phosphorylation, STAT3 localization, and CF profibrotic phenotype. Finally, as a first step in determining whether our findings in mouse translate to human, levels of phosphorylated βIV-spectrin were evaluated in ventricular lysates from normal (nonfailing) and failing human hearts. A significant increase in phosphorylated βIV-spectrin (as a fraction of total βIV-spectrin) was observed together with a decrease in overall βIV-spectrin levels in heart failure–compared control (Fig. 6, A–C), suggesting a potential role for this regulatory site in human disease. Here, we sought to identify the molecu"
https://openalex.org/W3176319171,"With increasing flood risk, evacuation has become an important research topic in urban flood management. Urban flood evacuation is a complex problem due to i) the complex interactions among several components within a city and ii) the need to consider multiple, often competing, dimensions/objectives in evacuation analysis. In this study, we focused on the interplay between two such objectives: efficiency and fairness. We captured the evacuation process in a conceptual agent-based model (ABM), which was analyzed under different hard infrastructure and institutional arrangement conditions, namely, various shelter capacity distributions as a hard infrastructure property and simultaneous/staged evacuation as an institutional arrangement. Efficiency was measured as the time it takes for a person to evacuate to safety. Fairness was defined by how equally residents suffered from floods, and the level of suffering depended on the perceived risk and evacuation time. Our findings suggested that efficiency is more sensitive to the shelter capacity distribution, while fairness changes more notably according to the evacuation priority assigned to the divided zones in staged evacuation. Simultaneous evacuation generally tended to be more efficient but unfairer than staged evacuation. The efficiency-fairness trade-off was captured by Pareto-optimal strategies, among which uniform capacity cases led to a higher efficiency while prioritizing high-risk residents increases fairness. Strategies balancing efficiency and fairness featured a uniform capacity and prioritized high-risk residents at an intermediate time delay. These findings more clearly exposed the interactions between different factors and could be adopted as benchmarks to inform more complicated evacuation ABMs."

Assessment of its magnitude, components, and risk factors is essentials to deploy visible interventions needed to avoid further complications. The study aimed to assess magnitude, components, and predictors of metabolic syndrome in Tigray region northern Ethiopia, 2016.Data were reviewed from Tigray region NCDs STEPs survey data base between May to June 2016. A total of 1476 adults aged 18-64 years were enrolled for the study. Multi-variable regression analysis was performed to estimate the net effect of size to risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome. Statistical significance was declared at p-value of ≤0.05 at 95% confidence interval (CI) for an adjusted odds ratio (AOR).The study revealed that unadjusted and adjusted prevalence rate of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) were (CPR = 33.79%; 95%CI: 31.29%-36.36%) and (APR = 34.2%; 95% CI: 30.31%-38.06%) respectively. The most prevalent MetS component was low HDL concentration (CPR = 70.91%; 95%CI: 68.47%-73.27%) and (APR = 70.61; 95%CI; 67.17-74.05).

https://openalex.org/W3173680466,"Social exclusion is a complex concept that is relevant in terms of the health of vulnerable groups. Attempts have been made in the past to measure it, both at the population and the individual level. The aim of this research was to engage with a broad range of relevant stakeholders in Ireland in order to learn how they defined and conceptualised social exclusion. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 24 participants selected using maximum variation sampling. One quarter of the interviewees were experts by experience. Participants included academic experts, the heads of organisations working nationally with socially excluded groups, politicians, clinicians, support workers and health service managers all with experience of working with socially excluded groups. The resulting definition of social exclusion was ""the experience of lack of opportunity, or the inability to make use of available opportunities, thereby preventing full participation in society."" From this, we developed a new model of the concept comprising three elements; Opportunities, Influencing factors and Social outcomes. Opportunities are the fundamental needs that are required to be met for a person to begin leaving social exclusion. Influencing factors are a mixture of the personal characteristics and more complex problems such as the intergenerational effects of disadvantage. Social outcomes include a person being accepted by wider society, and subsequently being able to participate. The conceptual framework we developed can contribute to a better understanding of the concept of social exclusion. The traditional policy focus on improving the needs of excluded people at the Opportunities level must continue, but must be complemented by tackling the problems at the levels of the Influencing factors and Social outcomes also. In terms of changes to practice, the measurement of the social exclusion status of people engaging with primary care and other services would be an important start in order to better understand the magnitude of the work required."
https://openalex.org/W3174495123,"Angiopoietins Ang1 and Ang2 are secreted ligands for the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 essential for vascular development and maintenance. Ang1 acts as an agonist to maintain normal vessel function, whereas Ang2 acts as a Tie2 antagonist. Ang2 is increased in macular edema, sepsis, and other conditions, in which it blocks Ang1-mediated signaling, causing vascular dysfunction and contributing to disease pathology. Therefore, Ang2 is an attractive therapeutic target. Previously, we reported a Tie2 ectodomain variant that selectively binds Ang2 and acts as soluble ligand trap to sequester Ang2; however, the mechanism of Ang2-binding selectivity is unknown. In the present study, we used directed protein evolution to enhance Ang2-binding affinity of this Tie2 ectodomain trap. We examined contributions of individual residues in the ligand-binding interface of Tie2 to Ang1 and Ang2 binding. Surprisingly, different combinations of Tie2 residues were found to bind each ligand, with hydrophobic residues binding both ligands and polar residues contributing selectively to either Ang1 or Ang2 binding. Our analysis also identified a single Tie2 residue, His168, with a pivotal role in both Ang1 and Ang2 binding, enabling competition between binding ligands. In summary, this study reports an enhanced-affinity Ang2-selective ligand trap with potential for therapeutic development and reveals the mechanism behind its selectivity. It also provides the first analysis of contributions of individual Tie2 residues to Ang1 and Ang2 binding and identifies selectivity-determining residues that could be targeted in the future design of small molecule and other inhibitors of Ang2 for the treatment of vascular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3177274521,"The receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is a multi-functional protein best known for facilitating cellular necroptosis and inflammation. Recent evidence from our lab indicates that RIPK3 expression must be tightly regulated in endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis, to maintain vascular integrity during embryogenesis, and to provide protection from postnatal atherosclerosis. RIPK3 activity and stability are regulated by post-translational modifications and caspase-dependent cleavage. However, less is known about the transcriptional regulation of Ripk3. Here we utilized an unbiased CRISPR-based technology called genomic locus proteomics (GLoPro) to screen transcription factors and coregulatory proteins associated with the Ripk3 locus in a murine endothelial cell line. We found that 41 nuclear proteins are specifically enriched at the Ripk3 locus, including the Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway components NFκB1 and IKBKG. We further verified that NFκB1 and IKBKG directly bind the Ripk3 promoter and prevent TNFα-induced Ripk3 transcription in cultured human primary endothelial cells. Moreover, NFκB1 prevents RIPK3-mediated death of primary endothelial cells. These data provide new insights into NF-κB signaling and Ripk3 transcriptional regulation in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W3173918658,"The role of the cerebellum in controlling the cough motor pattern is not well understood. We hypothesized that cerebellectomy would disinhibit motor drive to respiratory muscles during cough. Cough was induced by mechanical stimulation of the tracheobronchial airways in anesthetized, spontaneously breathing adult cats (8 male, 1 female), and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from upper airway, chest wall, and abdominal respiratory muscles. Cough trials were performed before and at two time points after total cerebellectomy (10 minutes and >1 hour). Unlike a prior report in paralyzed, decerebrated, and artificially ventilated animals, we observed that cerebellectomy had no effect on cough frequency. After cerebellectomy, thoracic inspiratory muscle EMG magnitudes increased during cough (diaphragm EMG increased by 14% at 10 minutes, p = 0.04; parasternal by 34% at 10 minutes and by 32% at >1 hour, p = 0.001 and 0.03 respectively). During cough at 10 minutes after cerebellectomy, inspiratory esophageal pressure was increased by 44% (p = 0.004), thyroarytenoid (laryngeal adductor) muscle EMG amplitude increased 13% (p = 0.04), and no change was observed in the posterior cricoarytenoid (laryngeal abductor) EMG. Cough phase durations did not change. Blood pressure and heart rate were reduced after cerebellectomy, and respiratory rate also decreased due to an increase in duration of the expiratory phase of breathing. Changes in cough-related EMG magnitudes of respiratory muscles suggest that the cerebellum exerts inhibitory control of cough motor drive, but not cough number or phase timing in response to mechanical stimuli in this model early after cerebellectomy. However, results varied widely at >1 hour after cerebellectomy, with some animals exhibiting enhancement or suppression of one or more components of the cough motor behavior. These results suggest that, while the cerebellum and behavior-related sensory feedback regulate cough, it may be difficult to predict the nature of the modulation based on total cerebellectomy."

According to previous works, the economic efficiency and impact mechanism of China's high-tech IDZ are analyzed profoundly. The machine learning (ML)-based Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Malmquist index measurement algorithms are adopted to analyze the dynamic and static characteristics of high-tech IDZ's economic data from 2009 to 2019. Furthermore, a high-tech IDZ economic efficiency influencing factor model is built. Based on the detailed data of a high-tech IDZ, the regional economic changes are analyzed from the following dimensions: economic environment, economic structure, number of talents, capital investment, and high-tech IDZ's regional scale, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model further. Results demonstrate that the comprehensive economic efficiency of all national high-tech IDZs in China is relatively high. However, there are huge differences among different regions. The economic efficiency of the eastern region is significantly lower than the national average. The economic structure, number of talents, capital investment, and economic efficiency of the high-tech IDZs show a significant positive correlation. The economic changes in high-tech IDZs can be improved through the secondary industry, employee value, and funding input.

https://openalex.org/W3176056723,"Human behavior lies somewhere between purely self-interested homo economicus and socially-motivated homo reciprocans. The factors that cause people to choose self-interest over costly cooperation can provide insights into human nature and are essential when designing institutions and policies that are meant to influence behavior. Alcohol consumption can shed light on the inflection point between selfish and selfless because it is commonly consumed and has global effects on the brain. The present study administered alcohol or placebo (N = 128), titrated to sex and weight, to examine its effect on cooperation in a standard task in experimental economics, the public goods game (PGG). Alcohol, compared to placebo, doubled the number of free-riders who contributed nothing to the public good and reduced average PGG contributions by 32% (p = .005). This generated 64% higher average profits in the PGG for those who consumed alcohol. The degree of intoxication, measured by blood alcohol concentration, linearly reduced PGG contributions (r = -0.18, p = .05). The reduction in cooperation was traced to a deterioration in mood and an increase in physiologic stress as measured by adrenocorticotropic hormone. Our findings indicate that moderate alcohol consumption inhibits the motivation to cooperate and that homo economicus is stressed and unhappy."

Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of jiggling exercises for outpatients with advanced- and terminal-stage hip osteoarthritis when performed for longer than 1 year, including increases in joint space width and remission of symptoms. We aimed to use the data from our own treatment to evaluate the short-term impact of intensive jiggling exercises on inpatients with hip osteoarthritis to further examine the clinical utility of this exercise. This retrospective case series study included nine patients (57 ± 12 years) with nine hip joints with advanced- or terminal-stage hip osteoarthritis who performed continuous daily jiggling exercises, beginning from day of hospitalization to 6 months post-discharge. Jiggling exercise was performed seated, using the KENKO YUSURI® automated heel vibrating machine at 3.3-5.0 Hz. The patients were also instructed against weight-bearing during hospitalization. The values of radiographic joint space width and Japanese Orthopaedic Association hip score for pain at hospital admission, discharge, and at the 6-month post-discharge checkup were evaluated. Although the hospitalization period and daily time spent performing the jiggling exercise varied in each case (27-98 days and 2-6 hours, respectively), the joint space width increased in all patients and there was an improvement in the hip pain scores in eight patients. The mean values of the minimum joint space width and hip pain scores at discharge were the highest compared to those at hospital admission and 6 months post-discharge. Our results suggest that intensive jiggling exercise for inpatients with advanced- and terminal-stage hip osteoarthritis leads to earlier improvement in joint space width and pain. Daily jiggling exercise for an adequate duration or in combination with non-weight-bearing practices may be a feasible conservative treatment for hip osteoarthritis."

Thus, the aim of the study was to develop and validate a heated air flow diffusion system to optimize and reduce the drying time of rotary dryers and improve the final quality of coffee. Computational fluid dynamics was used for the simulation of the air fluid dynamics in the combustion chamber of the heat generator. It was observed that the energy losses in the upper and lower walls of the heat generator chamber were higher with an increase in the convective heat transfer coefficient. It was found that the rate of fluid flow presented a fully developed profile, in which the higher speed value was found in the central region of the outlet. The reduction in moisture content during coffee drying was directly proportional to the increase in temperature. The Midilli model shows the best fit to describe the drying curves of the coffee. The effective diffusion coefficient increases with increasing temperature of the drying air. It was observed that the adjustments of the fluid dynamics in the burning of gas and the adaptation of the diffuser system significantly influenced the drying time and final quality of naturally processed and pulped coffees. In conclusion, the adapted technological set, a rotary dryer with gas heating and diffusion of heated air, had a high performance in the final quality of the coffee, and for this reason it is recommended to producers and the industry."
https://openalex.org/W3176776133,"The sla1+ gene of Schizosachharoymces pombe encodes La protein which promotes proper processing of precursor-tRNAs. Deletion of sla1 (sla1Δ) leads to disrupted tRNA processing and sensitivity to target of rapamycin (TOR) inhibition. Consistent with this, media containing NH4+ inhibits leucine uptake and growth of sla1Δ cells. Here, transcriptome analysis reveals that genes upregulated in sla1Δ cells exhibit highly significant overalp with general amino acid control (GAAC) genes in relevant transcriptomes from other studies. Growth in NH4+ media leads to additional induced genes that are part of a core environmental stress response (CESR). The sla1Δ GAAC response adds to evidence linking tRNA homeostasis and broad signaling in S. pombe. We provide evidence that deletion of the Rrp6 subunit of the nuclear exosome selectively dampens a subset of GAAC genes in sla1Δ cells suggesting that nuclear surveillance-mediated signaling occurs in S. pombe. To study the NH4+-effects, we isolated sla1Δ spontaneous revertants (SSR) of the slow growth phenotype and found that GAAC gene expression and rapamycin hypersensitivity were also reversed. Genome sequencing identified a F32V substitution in Any1, a known negative regulator of NH4+-sensitive leucine uptake linked to TOR. We show that 3H-leucine uptake by SSR-any1-F32V cells in NH4+-media is more robust than by sla1Δ cells. Moreover, F32V may alter any1+ function in sla1Δ vs. sla1+ cells in a distinctive way. Thus deletion of La, a tRNA processing factor leads to a GAAC response involving reprogramming of amino acid metabolism, and isolation of the any1-F32V rescuing mutant provides an additional specific link."
https://openalex.org/W3174267836,"The problem of product and process planning analysed so far is how we can take advantage of our strategy in planning. Among the principles of manufacturing and service management concepts is that after planning demand, planning transformation is one of the key steps of integrated efficiency; it makes it possible to save costs that are not value adding and are not necessary from the customer's point of view. Currently, the methods of material requirements and capacity planning can be seen as classic solutions that are based on dependency relations between different resources, which can be dynamic in space and time. Measuring and recording capacities raise several problems in addition to the fact that our planning methods are not always satisfying. In the literature, the methods of material requirements planning or manufacturing resource planning (MRP) are not typically optimization methods, so they do not guarantee the best solution, and even if our planning methods were satisfying, several manufacturing restrictions (the time allowed, the complexity of the planning process, the lack of testing opportunities, etc.) could prevent us from reaching satisfying application. It is necessary to create a simple planning algorithm that can give the planner a greater degree of freedom and that would be simple and algorithmic in order to maintain continuous conscious control, putting an end to planning uncertainty and leading us to the best solution under the given conditions. The aim of our research is to introduce a novel, simple planning algorithm, similar to heuristic methods that eliminates the problem of defining the order quantity when applying traditional methods, which prevents us from determining in advance which method is desirable (causing unnecessary planning steps); computer-based solutions hide the causal relations of the methodology from the planner (causing unreliability uncertainty)."

Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is associated with increased neutrophil granular protein (NGP) levels in the circulation. However, the systemic levels of neutrophil granular proteins were not examined in tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL) disease.We measured the systemic levels of NGP (myeloperoxidase [MPO], elastase and proteinase 3 [PRTN3]) in TBL and compared them to latent tuberculosis (LTB) and healthy control (HC) individuals. We also measured the pre-treatment (Pre-T) and post-treatment (Post-T) systemic levels of neutrophil granular proteins in TBL individuals upon anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) completion. In addition, we studied the correlation and discriminatory ability of NGPs using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Our data suggests that systemic levels of NGPs (MPO, PRTN3, elastase) were significantly reduced in TBL individuals compared to LTB and HC individuals. Similarly, after ATT, the plasma levels of MPO and elastase but not PRTN3 were significantly elevated compared to pre-treatment levels. NGPs (except PRTN3) were positively correlated with absolute neutrophil count of TBL, LTB and HC individuals. Further, NGPs were able to significantly discriminate TBL from LTB and HC individuals.Hence, we conclude reduced neutrophil granular protein levels might be associated with disease pathogenesis in TBL."
https://openalex.org/W3174904593,"In the US, the most significant morbidity and mortality associated with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is embolic stroke, with 90% of thrombus originating from the left atrial appendage (LAA). Anticoagulation is the preferred treatment for the prevention of stroke in NVAF patients, but clinical studies have demonstrated high levels of non-compliance and increased risk of bleeding or ineligibility for anticoagulation therapy, especially in the elderly population where the incidence of NVAF is highest. Alternatively, stroke may be preventing using clinically approved surgical and catheter-based devices to exclude or occlude the LAA, but these devices continue to be plagued by peri-device leaks and thrombus formation because of residual volume. To overcome these limitations, Cor Habere (Louisville, KY) and the University of Louisville are developing a LAA closure device (StrokeShield) that completely occludes and collapses the LAA to minimize the risk of stroke. The StrokeShield device is a collapsible occluder (nitinol reinforced membrane) that completely covers the LAA orifice with an expandable conical coil anchor that attaches to the myocardium. The device is designed for catheter-based delivery and expands to completely occlude the LAA orifice and collapse the LAA. The primary advantages of the StrokeShield system are a completely sealed LAA (no peri-device flow or residual space) and smooth endothelialized connection to the left atrial wall with minimal risk of cardiac bleeding and tamponade. We tested proof-of-concept of a prototype StrokeShield device in acute (n = 2) and chronic 60-day (n = 2) healthy canine models. Acute results demonstrated that the conical coil securely attached to the myocardium (5N pull-out force) and the Nitinol umbrella fully deployed and covered the LAA ostium. Results from the chronic implants demonstrated long-term feasibility of device placement with no procedural or device-related intra- or post-operative complications, secure placement and correct positioning of the device with no device migration. The device successfully occluded the LAA ostium and collapsed the LAA with no interference with the mitral valve, circumflex coronary artery, or pulmonary veins. Necropsy demonstrated no gross signs of thrombus or end-organ damage and the device was encapsulated in the LAA. Histology demonstrated mature neointima covering the device with expected foreign body inflammatory response. These early positive results will help to guide the iterative design process for the continued development of the StrokeShield system."
https://openalex.org/W3174920474,"Quantum computing is a newly emerging computing environment that has recently attracted intense research interest in improving the output fidelity, fully utilizing its high computing power from both hardware and software perspectives. In particular, several attempts have been made to reduce the errors in quantum computing algorithms through the efficient synthesis of quantum circuits. In this study, we present an application of an optimization model for synthesizing quantum circuits with minimum implementation costs to lower the error rates by forming a simpler circuit. Our model has a unique structure that combines the arc-subset selection problem with a conventional multi-commodity network flow model. The model targets the circuit synthesis with multiple control Toffoli gates to implement Boolean reversible functions that are often used as a key component in many quantum algorithms. Compared to previous studies, the proposed model has a unifying yet straightforward structure for exploiting the operational characteristics of quantum gates. Our computational experiment shows the potential of the proposed model, obtaining quantum circuits with significantly lower quantum costs compared to prior studies. The proposed model is also applicable to various other fields where reversible logic is utilized, such as low-power computing, fault-tolerant designs, and DNA computing. In addition, our model can be applied to network-based problems, such as logistics distribution and time-stage network problems."

However, the study of ecological environments primarily focuses on single-element research and lacks a comprehensive perspective. To examine ecological environmental trends on different scales, the present paper selected Yunnan Province as the study area. Chemical oxygen demand, rocky desertification, forest coverage, natural disaster data and spatial analysis methods were used to obtain the ecological environmental characteristics of each county and construct a comprehensive evaluation method of the ecological environment. The present paper revealed that the environmental capacity in Yunnan Province was at a moderate level, the ecological environment fragility was remarkable, the significance of the ecological environment was very high, natural disasters occurred frequently, and spatial differentiation between ecological environments was obvious. The province may be divided into three functional areas: the comprehensive-balanced area, the efficiency-dominated area and the environment-dominated area. Central Yunnan was a key development zone and the main area for the manufacturing and service industries, which were built as a modern industrial system in Yunnan Province. The ecological environment in northwestern Yunnan and southern Yunnan is of high significance, and this region was an ecological environment protection area that was important area for the construction of the modern agricultural system in Yunnan Province. To achieve sustainable development of the ecological environment, the spatial characteristics of the ecological environment must be determined at the county scale."
https://openalex.org/W3177054529,"Modern accounts of visual motion processing in the primate brain emphasize a hierarchy of different regions within the dorsal visual pathway, especially primary visual cortex (V1) and the middle temporal area (MT). However, recent studies have called the idea of a processing pipeline with fixed contributions to motion perception from each area into doubt. Instead, the role that each area plays appears to depend on properties of the stimulus as well as perceptual history. We propose to test this hypothesis in human subjects by comparing motion perception of two commonly used stimulus types: drifting sinusoidal gratings (DSGs) and random dot patterns (RDPs). To avoid potential biases in our approach we are pre-registering our study. We will compare the effects of size and contrast levels on the perception of the direction of motion for DSGs and RDPs. In addition, based on intriguing results in a pilot study, we will also explore the effects of a post-stimulus mask. Our approach will offer valuable insights into how motion is processed by the visual system and guide further behavioral and neurophysiological research."
