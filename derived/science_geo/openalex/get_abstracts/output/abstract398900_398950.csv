Their widespread use is limited by their low energy storage density and relatively high effective series resistance. Using chemical activation of exfoliated graphite oxide, we synthesized a porous carbon with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of up to 3100 square meters per gram, a high electrical conductivity, and a low oxygen and hydrogen content. This sp(2)-bonded carbon has a continuous three-dimensional network of highly curved, atom-thick walls that form primarily 0.6- to 5-nanometer-width pores. Two-electrode supercapacitor cells constructed with this carbon yielded high values of gravimetric capacitance and energy density with organic and ionic liquid electrolytes. The processes used to make this carbon are readily scalable to industrial levels."

Here, we show that deficiency of NLRP6 in mouse colonic epithelial cells results in reduced IL-18 levels and altered fecal microbiota characterized by expanded representation of the bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes (Prevotellaceae) and TM7. NLRP6 inflammasome-deficient mice were characterized by spontaneous intestinal hyperplasia, inflammatory cell recruitment, and exacerbation of chemical colitis induced by exposure to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Cross-fostering and cohousing experiments revealed that the colitogenic activity of this microbiota is transferable to neonatal or adult wild-type mice, leading to exacerbation of DSS colitis via induction of the cytokine, CCL5. Antibiotic treatment and electron microscopy studies further supported the role of Prevotellaceae as a key representative of this microbiota-associated phenotype. Altogether, perturbations in this inflammasome pathway, including NLRP6, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-18, may constitute a predisposing or initiating event in some cases of human IBD."

BRCA2 protects stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation RAD51 filament stabilization by BRCA2 C-ter separates fork protection from HDR Replication stalling of forks unprotected by BRCA2 causes genomic instability MRE11 inhibition prevents fork degradation and reduces resultant genomic instability BRCA2 is one of the two genes frequently found mutated in hereditary breast cancers, and its mutation is also associated with ovarian and pancreatic cancer in adults, as well as brain and other tumors in children with Fanconi anemia (Gudmundsdottir and Ashworth, 2006Gudmundsdottir K.

Although it may have other cellular functions, including during cell cycle progression (Ayoub et al., 2009Ayoub N. Rajendra E. Su X. Jeyasekharan A.D. Mahen R. Venkitaraman A.R.

Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), where it mediates RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation on single-stranded (ss) DNA (Jensen et al., 2010Jensen R.B. Carreira A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Purified human BRCA2 stimulates RAD51-mediated recombination.Nature. 2010; 467: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Human BRCA2 has 8 conserved RAD51 interaction motifs termed BRC repeats, which are essential for HDR (Moynahan and Jasin, 2010Moynahan M.E. Jasin M. Mitotic homologous recombination maintains genomic stability and suppresses tumorigenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The importance of HDR for survival is reflected in the observation that truncations of BRCA2 that include the BRC repeats are lethal in mice during embryogenesis (Moynahan, 2002Moynahan M.E. The cancer connection: BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppression in mice and humans.Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8994-9007Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to the BRC repeats, a RAD51 interaction site has been identified in the C-terminal ∼200 amino acids of BRCA2 (C-ter), which is also conserved, but which is distinct in sequence from the BRC repeats (Esashi et al., 2005Esashi F. Christ N. Gannon J. Liu Y. Hunt T. Jasin M. West S.C. CDK-dependent phosphorylation of BRCA2 as a regulatory mechanism for recombinational repair.Nature. 2005; 434: 598-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Whereas BRCA2 truncations involving only the BRCA2 C-ter region appear developmentally normal, they confer shorter life spans, increased tumorigenesis, and hematopoietic dysfunction (McAllister et al., 2002McAllister K.A.

BRCA2 plays a key role in repairing DSBs arising during replication, which are repaired by HDR (Bryant et al., 2005Bryant H.E. Schultz N. Thomas H.D. Parker K.M. Flower D. Lopez E. Kyle S. Meuth M.

Biol. 2008; 15: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although DSBs in principle can be repaired via nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), HDR is a preferred pathway during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle when homologous chromatids are available to template the repair process (Moynahan and Jasin, 2010Moynahan M.E. Jasin M. Mitotic homologous recombination maintains genomic stability and suppresses tumorigenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). DSB repair by either pathway requires end-processing, for which the MRE11 nuclease is implicated (Mimitou and Symington, 2009Mimitou E.P. Symington L.S. DNA end resection: many nucleases make light work.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2009; 8: 983-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To this end, MRE11 has endonuclease activity that promotes 5′-3′ resection of DNA ends critical for HDR, as well as 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (Williams et al., 2008Williams R.S. Moncalian G. Williams J.S. Yamada Y. Limbo O. Shin D.S. Groocock L.M. Cahill D. Hitomi C. Guenther G. et al.Mre11 dimers coordinate DNA end bridging and nuclease processing in double-strand-break repair.Cell. 2008; 135: 97-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), which may also trim DNA ends for repair. Moreover, MRE11 is rapidly recruited to nuclear foci at stalled forks on exposure to the replication poison hydroxyurea (HU) (Wang et al., 2000Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. BASC, a super complex of BRCA1-associated proteins involved in the recognition and repair of aberrant DNA structures.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939PubMed Google Scholar). Given the central function BRCA2 during HDR, it has been presumed that BRCA2 is required during replication perturbation due to its function in HDR (Budzowska and Kanaar, 2009Budzowska M. Kanaar R. Mechanisms of dealing with DNA damage-induced replication problems.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 53: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, Nagaraju and Scully, 2007Nagaraju G. Scully R. Minding the gap: the underground functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 at stalled replication forks.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 1018-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here we investigate at the molecular level the role of BRCA2 when replication is perturbed in vivo. We find that BRCA2 has a protective function during replication fork stalling that is mechanistically distinct from repair via HDR. Specifically, BRCA2 prevents degradation of nascent strands at stalled forks by MRE11. The RAD51 binding site within the BRCA2 C-ter, which stabilizes RAD51 filaments, is necessary for protection of stalled forks, but it is not required for DSB repair via HDR, providing a separation of function between these two processes. BRCA2 mutants with compromised fork protection exhibit increased spontaneous and HU-induced chromosomal aberrations that are alleviated by MRE11 inhibition. Thus, these data reveal a critical role for BRCA2 in maintaining genomic stability, and likely suppressing tumorigenesis, independent of HDR. To obtain a better understanding of BRCA2′s role during DNA replication, DNA fiber analysis was utilized to monitor replication perturbation genome-wide at single-molecule resolution (Figure 1A ). This procedure marks newly synthesized DNA strands just before (green fluorescent IdU) and after (red fluorescent CldU) exposure to HU, which transiently stalls replication by causing an imbalance in the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pool. Retention of the IdU label after HU treatment measures the stability of stalled forks (Σ IdU) (Figure 1A). In hamster cells expressing wild-type BRCA2 (V-C8+BRCA2), the median IdU tract length is maintained intact with or without HU treatment for 5 hr (9.73 and 9.77 μm respectively, p = 0.924, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) (Figure 1B), indicating that the integrity of stalled forks is not compromised during prolonged periods of replication stress. In contrast, nascent IdU tracts substantially shorten in cells deficient for BRCA2 (V-C8) (Wiegant et al., 2006Wiegant W.W. Overmeer R.M. Godthelp B.C. van Buul P.P. Zdzienicka M.Z. Chinese hamster cell mutant, V-C8, a model for analysis of Brca2 function.Mutat. Res. 2006; 600: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) when replication forks are stalled compared to unperturbed replication (5.44 and 9.06 μm, respectively, p < 0.0001) (Figure 1B). As nascent IdU tracts are formed before treatment with HU, the disappearance of IdU label occurs during HU exposure. We confirmed that IdU shortening in BRCA2-deficient cells occurs irrespective of the choice of the replication poison by replacing HU with the chemotherapeutic gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNA elongation (see Figure S1A available online). Thus, BRCA2 functions in protecting nascent strands when replication forks are stalled. To determine if the requirement for BRCA2 in protecting stalled replication forks is common to other cell types, we examined Brca2lex1/lex2 mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells, which express a C-terminal truncation of BRCA2 (Morimatsu et al., 1998Morimatsu M. Donoho G. Hasty P. Cells deleted for Brca2 COOH terminus exhibit hypersensitivity to gamma-radiation and premature senescence.Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3441-3447PubMed Google Scholar). As with V-C8 cells, IdU tracts shorten in Brca2lex1/lex2 cells exposed to HU compared with unimpeded replication (4.76 and 6.79 μm, respectively; p < 0.0001), whereas the nascent tracts remain intact in wild-type mES cells (Figure 1C and Figure S1B). In addition, human CAPAN-1 cells, which express a similar BRCA2 truncation as V-C8 cells (Goggins et al., 1996Goggins M. Schutte M. Lu J. Moskaluk C.A. Weinstein C.L. Petersen G.M. Yeo C.J. Jackson C.E. Lynch H.T. Hruban R.H. et al.Germline BRCA2 gene mutations in patients with apparently sporadic pancreatic carcinomas.Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5360-5364PubMed Google Scholar), are defective in maintaining nascent tracts compared with unimpeded replication (5.41 μm and 9.53 μm, respectively; p < 0.0001) (Figure 1D and Figure S1C). Reversion of the BRCA2 mutation in the CAPAN-1 cells by a nearby second-site mutation (C2-14 cells) (Sakai et al., 2008Sakai W. Swisher E.M. Karlan B.Y. Agarwal M.K. Higgins J. Friedman C. Villegas E. Jacquemont C. Farrugia D.J. Couch F.J. et al.Secondary mutations as a mechanism of cisplatin resistance in BRCA2-mutated cancers.Nature. 2008; 451: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) (Figure S1C) largely restores the protection of the stalled replication forks (Figure 1D). These results indicate that BRCA2 is required for the protection of stalled replication forks in multiple mammalian cell lines. Depletion of RAD51 has been reported to decrease replication restart after HU (Petermann et al., 2010Petermann E. Orta M.L. Issaeva N. Schultz N. Helleday T. Hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks become progressively inactivated and require two different RAD51-mediated pathways for restart and repair.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 492-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and uncouple leading and lagging-strands (Hashimoto et al., 2010Hashimoto Y. Chaudhuri A.R. Lopes M. Costanzo V. Rad51 protects nascent DNA from Mre11-dependent degradation and promotes continuous DNA synthesis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1305-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To address whether replication recovery is affected when BRCA2 is absent, CldU tract lengths formed after HU exposure were measured. Replication is substantially slowed after HU treatment, but similarly so in both control and BRCA2-deficient cells (5.93 and 5.67 μm, V-C8+BRCA2 and V-C8 after HU, respectively) (Figure 1E). In these experiments, the IdU and CldU labels are often quite separated, indicating that forks stall only transiently with HU in these hamster cells. Therefore, we assessed the frequency of replication restart (IdU→CldU) when CldU was present during HU. As with replication recovery after HU, we find no significant difference between BRCA2-proficient and deficient hamster cells (Figure S1D). Further, the frequency of new replication tracts is also unaffected by BRCA2 status (Figure S1D). Given that replication restart may be more stringently controlled in human cells than rodent cells (Petermann et al., 2010Petermann E. Orta M.L. Issaeva N. Schultz N. Helleday T. Hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks become progressively inactivated and require two different RAD51-mediated pathways for restart and repair.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 492-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), we also assessed restart in CAPAN-1 and revertant cells. Consistent with a more efficient block in human cells, IdU and CdU tracts are more frequently joined when the CldU label is added after HU exposure than they are in hamster cells. This apparent replication restart (IdU→CldU) is not significantly impaired under this condition with or without BRCA2 (Figure S1E), although we did observe a small increase in tracts labeled only with IdU in CAPAN-1 cells (13% to 19%, p = 0.279; Figure S1E). We noticed that most restart tracts have small gaps between the IdU and CldU labels (Figure 1F, right), indicating limited fork progression during exposure to HU. A larger portion of tracts from CAPAN-1 C2-14 cells have gaps (77.5%) compared with CAPAN-1 cells (66.5%), implying that the block to restart is more efficient in the absence of BRCA2 (p = 0.0134) (Figure 1H). To examine transient replication restart during HU, we included CldU during HU in a control experiment in CAPAN-1 cells and found that ∼97% of forks continue to incorporate CldU label even in the presence of HU (Figure 1F, left). Surprisingly, the continuous CldU tracts formed during HU are substantially longer than the gaps between the two labels in experiments where the label is omitted during HU (compare 9.73 μm CldU tract length during HU and 1.27 μm gap length during HU without label) (Figure 1G). We interpret this data to reflect asymmetric replication fork movement during HU, indicating leading and lagging strand uncoupling (Figure S1F). We reasoned that gap tract lengths can be used to assess the ability of both strands to continue replication during HU. Gap lengths are smaller in CAPAN-1 compared to CAPAN-1 C2-14 cells (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1H), providing evidence that BRCA2 can suppress uncoupling of the leading and lagging strands. To better understand the mechanism of replication tract shortening during fork stalling, we monitored the integrity of the nascent strands by varying the exposure times to HU. Consistent with nucleolytic degradation of the stalled forks, preformed IdU tracts in V-C8 cells progressively shorten during HU (Figure 2A , inset, and Figure S2A ), with a rate of 0.7 μm/hr, corresponding to ∼1.8 kb/hr. By contrast, preformed IdU tracts in cells with BRCA2 remain largely unchanged (Figure 2B and Figure S2B).Figure S2Characterization of Nascent Strand Shortening by MRE11, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Cumulative distribution curves for IdU DNA fiber tract lengths of V-C8 (A) and V-C8+BRCA2 (B) cells during different exposure times to HU for data shown in Figure 2A and 2B, respectively.(C) Composite length distribution curves for IdU+CldU DNA fiber tract from V-C8 and V-C8+BRCA2 cells with or without HU (left panel) for data shown in Figure 2D and 2E.

See also Table S1. To fine map the degradation, we consecutively labeled nascent tracts with IdU and CldU for equal periods of time before HU (Figure 2C). In unperturbed V-C8 cells, IdU and CldU tracts are similar in length (CldU/IdU = 1.03) (Figure 2D). When challenged with HU, CldU tracts shorten whereas IdU tracts remain intact (CldU/IdU = 0.65) (Figure 2D and Figure S2C), indicating that the more recently synthesized DNA is degraded first. Thus, leading strands are degraded 3′-5′, whereas lagging strands are degraded 5′-3′ (Figure 2C). In contrast, the CldU/IdU ratio in VC-8+BRCA2 cells is ∼1 with or without HU (Figure 2E and Figure S2C). These results imply that BRCA2 protects against degradation of stalled replication forks with opposite directionalities for the leading and lagging strands. The slow kinetics of degradation (∼1.8 kb/hr) are reminiscent of another controlled degradative process, that of DNA end resection (∼4 kb/hr in yeast) (Fishman-Lobell et al., 1992Fishman-Lobell J. Rudin N. Haber J.E. Two alternative pathways of double-strand break repair that are kinetically separable and independently modulated.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We considered that MRE11, which possesses 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and also promotes 5′-3′ end resection (Mimitou and Symington, 2009Mimitou E.P. Symington L.S. DNA end resection: many nucleases make light work.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2009; 8: 983-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, Williams et al., 2008Williams R.S. Moncalian G. Williams J.S. Yamada Y. Limbo O. Shin D.S. Groocock L.M. Cahill D. Hitomi C. Guenther G. et al.Mre11 dimers coordinate DNA end bridging and nuclease processing in double-strand-break repair.Cell. 2008; 135: 97-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), could promote fork degradation in the absence of BRCA2. To test this, we used mirin, a chemical inhibitor of MRE11 nuclease activity (Dupre et al., 2008Dupre A. Boyer-Chatenet L. Sattler R.M. Modi A.P. Lee J.H. Nicolette M.L. Kopelovich L. Jasin M. Baer R. Paull T.T. et al.A forward chemical genetic screen reveals an inhibitor of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). With mirin, IdU tracts are similar in length irrespective of replication stalling in both BRCA2-deficient and proficient cells (Figure 2F and Figure S2D), suggesting that the MRE11 nuclease degrades stalled forks in the absence of BRCA2. To exclude off-target effects by the inhibitor, we expressed shRNA against MRE11 in Brca2lex1/lex2 cells (Figure 2G), which like mirin, substantially protects the nascent tracts during HU (6.18 and 4.05 μm with and without MRE11 knockdown, respectively; p < 0.0001) (Figure 2G). These results further implicate the MRE11 complex, specifically its nuclease activity, in fork degradation in the absence of BRCA2. The KU heterodimer, a key component of canonical NHEJ, is important in the protection of DNA ends from nucleolytic digestion (Kass and Jasin, 2010Kass E.M. Jasin M. Collaboration and competition between DNA double-strand break repair pathways.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3703-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We tested whether loss of KU would also lead to deprotection of DNA ends at stalled replication forks. Nascent IdU tracts are maintained intact in Ku70−/− mES cells (Figure 3A ), consistent with a specific role for KU at DSBs, but not at stalled forks (Pierce et al., 2001Pierce A.J. Hu P. Han M. Ellis N. Jasin M. Ku DNA end-binding protein modulates homologous repair of double-strand breaks in mammalian cells.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3237-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We next examined whether protection of stalled forks is a property of all HDR proteins. RAD54 acts during late steps of HDR (Heyer et al., 2006Heyer W.D. Li X. Rolfsmeier M. Zhang X.P. Rad54: the Swiss Army knife of homologous recombination?.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4115-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), downstream of BRCA2-mediated RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation. Yet, RAD54 is not evidently involved in fork protection, as Rad54−/− mES cells exhibit similar IdU tract lengths with or without HU (Figure 3B), thus indicating that not all HDR components are required to avoid fork degradation. BRCA2 contains both protein and DNA interaction domains, including several BRC repeats that bind RAD51, a DNA binding domain (DBD) consisting of several DNA binding modules, and a C-terminal site (C-ter) that also binds RAD51 (Figure 4A ). Given the multidomain structure of BRCA2, we sought to characterize the domain requirements for replication fork stability. V-C8 cells have two Brca2 alleles encoding proteins truncated for the C-ter and DBD domain (Figure 4A) (Wiegant et al., 2006Wiegant W.W. Overmeer R.M. Godthelp B.C. van Buul P.P. Zdzienicka M.Z.

USA. 2006; 103: 8768-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and maintenance of fork stability (Figure 1B). As BRCA2 could directly inhibit degradation via protein-DNA interactions requiring the DBD domain, we generated a V-C8 cell line stably expressing a BRCA2 peptide missing the entire DBD domain (PIR2; Figure 4A), but which is proficient at HDR (Figure S3A ) (Edwards et al., 2008Edwards S.L. Brough R. Lord C.J. Natrajan R. Vatcheva R. Levine D.A. Boyd J. Reis-Filho J.S. Ashworth A. Resistance to therapy caused by intragenic deletion in BRCA2.Nature. 2008; 451: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). No substantial difference in IdU tract lengths was observed with or without HU (9.69 and 8.74 μm, respectively) (Figure 4B and Figure S3B). Thus, the BRCA2 DBD is not required for the protection of stalled replication forks, indicating that it is unlikely that BRCA2 directly inhibits nucleolytic degradation by binding to nascent DNA. V-C8 cells stably expressing a peptide consisting of one BRC repeat fused to the large subunit of the ssDNA-binding protein RPA (BRC3-RPA) (Figure 4A) are proficient in HDR (Saeki et al., 2006Saeki H. Siaud N. Christ N. Wiegant W.W. van Buul P.P. Han M. Zdzienicka M.Z. Stark J.M. Jasin M. Suppression of the DNA repair defects of BRCA2-deficient cells with heterologous protein fusions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 8768-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that the main function of BRCA2 in HDR is to deliver RAD51 to ssDNA. These cells, however, exhibit shorter nascent IdU tract lengths when replication is stalled with HU (6.35 and 8.81 μm with and without HU, respectively, p < 0.0001) (Figure 4C and Figure S3C). Although the degradation is not as extensive as with V-C8 cells (Figure 1B), these results suggest that the delivery of RAD51 to ssDNA is not sufficient to protect stalled forks. BRCA2 interacts with RAD51 through both the BRC repeats and the C-ter. Although RAD51 loading through the BRC repeats does not seem to be sufficient for the protection of stalled forks, the conserved C-ter appears to provide an essential function, given our results with the Brca2lex1/lex2 cells (Figure 1C). The C-ter binds RAD51 differently than the BRC repeats in that it interacts with RAD51 oligomers and stabilizes RAD51 filaments (Davies and Pellegrini, 2007Davies O.R. Pellegrini L.

Moreover, the RAD51 binding site at the C-ter contains a cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation consensus sequence that is conserved throughout vertebrates (Esashi et al., 2005Esashi F.

https://openalex.org/W2007296377,"Bacterial persistence is a state in which a sub-population of dormant cells, or 'persisters', tolerates antibiotic treatment. Bacterial persisters have been implicated in biofilms and in chronic and recurrent infections. Despite this clinical relevance, there are currently no viable means for eradicating persisters. Here we show that specific metabolic stimuli enable the killing of both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) persisters with aminoglycosides. This potentiation is aminoglycoside-specific, it does not rely on growth resumption and it is effective in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It proceeds by the generation of a proton-motive force which facilitates aminoglycoside uptake. Our results demonstrate that persisters, although dormant, are primed for metabolite uptake, central metabolism and respiration. We show that aminoglycosides can be used in combination with specific metabolites to treat E. coli and S. aureus biofilms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this approach can improve the treatment of chronic infections in a mouse urinary tract infection model. This work establishes a strategy for eradicating bacterial persisters that is based on metabolism, and highlights the importance of the metabolic environment to antibiotic treatment."

Planarians are flatworms and regenerate from tiny body fragments, a process requiring a population of proliferating cells (neoblasts). Whether regeneration is accomplished by pluripotent cells or by the collective activity of multiple lineage-restricted cell types is unknown. We used ionizing radiation and single-cell transplantation to identify neoblasts that can form large descendant-cell colonies in vivo. These clonogenic neoblasts (cNeoblasts) produce cells that differentiate into neuronal, intestinal, and other known postmitotic cell types and are distributed throughout the body. Single transplanted cNeoblasts restored regeneration in lethally irradiated hosts. We conclude that broadly distributed, adult pluripotent stem cells underlie the remarkable regenerative abilities of planarians."

Katsanis N. Mechanistic insights into Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a model ciliopathy.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Studies of these diseases suggest that their pathogenesis relates to dysfunction of the microtubule-based primary cilium. It is hypothesized that the primary cilium is a sensory organelle, acting as a mechanosensor in the kidney and organizing sensory receptors, including rhodopsin, in the retina. Cilia are also key components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway (Corbit et al., 2005Corbit K.C. Aanstad P. Singla V. Norman A.R. Stainier D.Y. Reiter J.F. Vertebrate Smoothened functions at the primary cilium.Nature. 2005; 437: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, Huangfu et al., 2003Huangfu D. Liu A. Rakeman A.S. Murcia N.S. Niswander L. Anderson K.V. Hedgehog signalling in the mouse requires intraflagellar transport proteins.Nature. 2003; 426: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). The consistent finding of kidney, retinal, liver, limb, and brain defects among the ciliopathies in turn suggests that cilia-dependent sensory and signaling functions are critical in the development, tissue organization, and physiological function of multiple organ systems. However, whether all “ciliopathies” are simply caused by the absence of cilia themselves remains unclear. Specific ciliary signaling pathways, ciliary receptors, additional ciliary effectors, or even centrosomes, may be at the root of specific types of tissue or sensory failure, and these relationships have remained elusive. Three linked ciliopathies called Nephronophthisis (NPHP), Joubert syndrome (JBTS), and Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) are autosomal-recessive disorders, initially described as distinct entities but recently found to share phenotypic overlap, notably in cystic kidney disease. Nephronophthisis is the least severe of the group, characterized primarily by renal cysts but sometimes involving retinal degeneration (called Senior-Loken syndrome), situs inversus, and mental retardation (Hildebrandt et al., 2009aHildebrandt F. Attanasio M. Otto E. Nephronophthisis: disease mechanisms of a ciliopathy.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Joubert syndrome involves both renal and nonrenal manifestations of NPHP disease but is distinguished by cerebellar vermis aplasia, a significant malformation of the cerebellum that is linked to ataxia (Parisi et al., 2007Parisi M.A. Doherty D. Chance P.F. Glass I.A. Joubert syndrome (and related disorders) (OMIM 213300).Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 15: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As a perinatal lethal disease, Meckel-Gruber syndrome is the most severe, characterized by occipital encephalocele, polydactyly, liver fibrosis, and severe renal cysts (Salonen and Paavola, 1998Salonen R. Paavola P. Meckel syndrome.J. Med. Genet. 1998; 35: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To date, mutations in 16 genes have been linked to this group of disorders: NPHP1–9, AHI1/Jouberin, ARL13B, INPP5E, TMEM216, MKS1, MKS3/TMEM67, and MKS6/CC2D2A (Tallila et al., 2008Tallila J.

The role of primary cilia in neuronal function.Neurobiol. Dis. 2010; 38: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar; Supplemental References). Interestingly, different alleles of the same gene can result in the phenotypic spectrum of NPHP, JBTS, and MKS. For example, NPHP1 mutations were reported in patients with both NPHP and JBTS (Parisi et al., 2007Parisi M.A. Doherty D. Chance P.F. Glass I.A. Joubert syndrome (and related disorders) (OMIM 213300).Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 15: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas mutations in NPHP3, NPHP6/CEP290, and NPHP8/RPGRIP1L are linked to all forms of disease along the NPHP-JBTS-MKS spectrum (Baala et al., 2007Baala L. Audollent S. Martinovic J. Ozilou C. Babron M.C. Sivanandamoorthy S. Saunier S. Salomon R. Gonzales M.

Genet. 2007; 81: 170-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ). Because these three diseases can be caused by mutation of the same genes, we considered the hypothesis that these disorders may link to defects in a specific set of cellular mechanisms and that the associated proteins may interact and function in common pathways. NPHP/JBTS/MKS proteins are rich in protein-protein interaction domains (Figure S1A available online), suggesting extensive protein-protein interactions. Studies using yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) discovered interactions of NPHP1 with NPHP2, NPHP3, and NPHP4 (Mollet et al., 2002Mollet G. Salomon R. Gribouval O. Silbermann F.

Complexes associated with each cystoprotein were immunopurified from stable cell lines using anti-GFP antibody beads, eluted with TEV protease and recaptured on S-protein agarose. Eluates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and interacting proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The proteins encoded by genes mutated in NPHP, JBTS, and MKS are found either within the primary cilium or at the basal body, and several have homologs in Chlamydomonas (Hildebrandt et al., 2009aHildebrandt F. Attanasio M. Otto E. Nephronophthisis: disease mechanisms of a ciliopathy.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), suggesting that they participate in conserved ciliary machinery. However, some of these proteins are centrosomal even in the absence of cilia (Chang et al., 2006Chang B. Khanna H. Hawes N. Jimeno D. He S. Lillo C. Parapuram S.K. Cheng H. Scott A. Hurd R.E. et al.In-frame deletion in a novel centrosomal/ciliary protein CEP290/NPHP6 perturbs its interaction with RPGR and results in early-onset retinal degeneration in the rd16 mouse.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1847-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), suggesting that these machines may function at the centrosome, possibly to organize cell polarity or receptor trafficking, rather than simply being a structural component of the primary cilium. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying NPHP-JBTS-MKS, we developed a high-confidence proteomic strategy using the G-LAP tandem-affinity method (Torres et al., 2009Torres J.Z. Miller J.J. Jackson P.K. High-throughput generation of tagged stable cell lines for proteomic analysis.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 2888-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to identify interactors associated with nine disease proteins. Our data show that NPHP-JBTS-MKS proteins form an interaction network that can be classified into three distinct modules: NPHP1-4-8, NPHP5-6, and Mks. Assays for ciliogenesis and epithelial morphogenesis using three-dimensional (3D) renal cultures suggest that NPHP1-4-8 links primarily to apical organization defects seen in nephronophthisis, whereas ciliary NPHP5-6 deficits appear central to retinal and potentially neural deficiency, with Mks module and Hedgehog signaling defects linked to the neural tube defects. Excitingly, our network building strategy allowed us to propose candidates for new ciliopathy disease genes, leading to the identification of the first human mutations in the NPHP gene Ataxin10 (ATXN10) and JBTS gene Tectonic2 (TCTN2). To better define physical interactions among the NPHP-JBTS-MKS disease proteins, we used the G-LAP-Flp purification strategy (Torres et al., 2009Torres J.Z. Miller J.J. Jackson P.K. High-throughput generation of tagged stable cell lines for proteomic analysis.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 2888-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to identify interacting proteins that copurify with the nine disease gene products known at the time that this study was initiated. The G-LAP-Flp strategy is an optimized system for rapid generation of mammalian stable cell lines that facilitates high-confidence and high-throughput proteomic studies. We created clonal Flp-In cell lines stably expressing a LAP tag (EGFP-TEV-S-peptide) fused to the amino terminus of each individual disease protein (NPHP1, NPHP2/inversin, NPHP3, NPHP4, NPHP5/IQCB1, NPHP6/CEP290, NPHP8/RPGRIP1L, AHI1/Jouberin, and MKS1) in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, mouse kidney inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD3) cells, or human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. These ciliated cell models provide a physiologically relevant context for studying ciliary assembly, signaling, and cystogenesis pathways. We then isolated complexes associated with each bait protein by tandem affinity purification and identified interacting proteins by mass spectrometry (MS) (Figure S1B). To identify bona fide interactors, we optimized the LAP purification procedure to avoid the possibility of carryover, which would severely confound the analysis of a protein network (Extended Experimental Procedures). For each candidate interactor, we evaluated metric MS data including the total number of peptides, the sum of ion currents contributing to a specific mass spectrum (Sum TIC), and the percent sequence coverage. Data from fifteen affinity purification protein mass spectrometry (APMS) experiments were compiled into a single data set. If any single spectrum from an identifiable peptide was found, the corresponding protein was included (Table S1 and Data S1). Using the method developed by Scholtens and Gentleman (Scholtens, 2004Scholtens, D. (2004). apComplex: Estimate protein complex membership using AP-MS protein data. R package version 2.14.0.Google Scholar, Scholtens et al., 2005Scholtens D. Vidal M. Gentleman R. Local modeling of global interactome networks.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3548-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we performed a proteomic network analysis (Extended Experimental Procedures and Data S2), which we visualized using the Cytoscape software package (Data S3) (Shannon et al., 2003Shannon P. Markiel A. Ozier O. Baliga N.S. Wang J.T. Ramage D. Amin N. Schwikowski B. Ideker T. Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (18644) Google Scholar). This method creates a ranked list of the most probable subgraphs, representing interactions (edges) between proteins (nodes) in a graphical form (Figures 1D–1F and Figure S2). Here, the nodes represent the individual NPHP, JBTS, and MKS protein baits plus the identified hits. Hits identified in an APMS experiment are hypothesized to interact with the bait protein, and this connection is represented by an edge between the bait node and the node representing the hit. If a newly identified protein (node) shows a single interaction (edge) with a bait, it is of lower informational value compared to a node that shows multiple interactions with different baits; the presence of symmetric interactions, where two baits both identify the other efficiently in the APMS experiment, is of the highest value. Here, we began our analysis by first constructing a network based solely on the physical interactions seen in our APMS data set and later incorporating additional functional data to further validate the network. When the physical interaction data are analyzed using this method, a striking disease protein network emerges. As highlighted in Figures 1B and 1C, we find that the most significant interactors for the NPHP-JBTS-MKS disease proteins are, in fact, other disease proteins from the same group. Our data confirm some previously reported interactions, including the NPHP1-NPHP2 and NPHP1-NPHP4 interactions (Mollet et al., 2002Mollet G. Salomon R. Gribouval O. Silbermann F. Bacq D. Landthaler G. Milford D. Nayir A. Rizzoni G. Antignac C. Saunier S. The gene mutated in juvenile nephronophthisis type 4 encodes a novel protein that interacts with nephrocystin.Nat.

Genet. 2003; 34: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). However, our analysis is more comprehensive and provides a quantitative view of the most abundant interactors (Table S1). To validate our network, we tested several newly identified interactions by coimmunoprecipitation and by in vitro binding to identify direct interactions. Our analysis reveals that NPHP-JBTS-MKS proteins do not form a single complex but instead cluster into three biochemically distinct modules: (1) NPHP1, NPHP4, NPHP8 (“1-4-8”), (2) NPHP5, NPHP6 (“5-6”), and (3) MKS1, MKS6 (“MKS”). Below, we describe interactions within the specific modules. NPHP1, NPHP4, and NPHP8 show strong mutual interactions via LAP tagging. LAP-NPHP1 purifications contained endogenous NPHP4 and NPHP8 peptides in high abundance. Reciprocally, NPHP1 was identified in LAP-NPHP4 and LAP-NPHP8 purifications (Table S1 and Table S2). Visualizing purified LAP-NPHP1 on silver-stained gels revealed a substoichiometric band of NPHP8 and barely detectable NPHP4. LAP-NPHP4 purifications showed a band of NPHP8, NPHP1, and distinctive breakdown products of NPHP4. LAP-NPHP8 showed high-efficiency interactions with NPHP1 and NPHP4 (Figure 2A ). Quite possibly, NPHP1-4-8 form multiple or processed complexes. We used in vitro binding to test whether these NPHP proteins interact directly. We assayed whether in vitro-translated Myc-tagged NPHP1, NPHP4, and NPHP8 immunoprecipitate HA-tagged proteins produced by in vitro translation in wheat germ extracts. We find that NPHP4 directly binds both NPHP1 and NPHP8 in vitro and can bridge the interaction between NPHP1 and NPHP8, whereas NPHP1 and NPHP8 do not appear to bind directly (Figures 2B, 2C, and 2H). To explore functional interactions among NPHP1, NPHP4, and NPHP8, we investigated their subcellular localization. LAP-NPHP1, LAP-NPHP4, and LAP-NPHP8 each localize diffusely in the cytoplasm of IMCD3 cells seeded at low density. Strikingly, as cells approach confluence and develop into polarized epithelial monolayers, these NPHP proteins accumulate to cell-cell contacts, mostly basolateral of tight junctions (Figure 3A and Figures S4A and S4B). The NPHP1-4-8 proteins can also be found at a specified compartment that extends between the basal body to the base of the axoneme, shown by costaining with the mother centriole marker ODF2, centriole distal appendage marker OFD1, and axonemal acetylated tubulin (Figures 3A and 3B). This NPHP1-4-8 compartment is reminiscent of the ciliary transition zone, believed to function as part of the ciliary sensory machinery in worms (Fliegauf et al., 2006Fliegauf M. Horvath J. von Schnakenburg C. Olbrich H. Müller D. Thumfart J. Schermer B. Pazour G.J. Neumann H.P. Zentgraf H. et al.Nephrocystin specifically localizes to the transition zone of renal and respiratory cilia and photoreceptor connecting cilia.J. Am. Soc.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5575-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The localization of NPHP1-4-8 at transition zones can appear even in sparse cells before the cell monolayer is fully organized into an epithelial sheet with complete adherens and apical junctions. This suggests that NPHP1-4-8 can be organized above the basal body independently from its organization at cell-cell junctions, and the basal body may be sufficient to organize the “1-4-8” compartment at the transition zone. NPHP1-4-8 each contain C2 domains, which might mediate interactions with phospholipids at cell-cell junctions or at the ciliary base. Some previously reported interactors of NPHP1-4-8 were not seen in our purifications, including NPHP3, NPHP6, and a group of cortical regulators (Pyk2, p130Cas, PALS1, PATJ, and Par6) (Benzing et al., 2001Benzing T.

These absences likely reflect: (1) differences in the efficiency of detecting interactions by APMS versus coimmunoprecipitation/immunoblot, (2) the difficulty of detecting membrane-protein interactions in detergent lysates, or (3) more interestingly, rewired interactions in different tissues. Notably, we did validate that NPHP1 interacts with NPHP3 by coimmunoprecipitation, showing that co-IP is more sensitive to show some interactions, compared to copurification (Figure S3D ). Purifications of NPHP5 and NPHP6 consistently demonstrated strong binding between NPHP5 (MW ∼68 kD) and NPHP6/CEP290 (MW ∼290 kD) in NIH 3T3, IMCD3, and human RPE cells (Figure 2D, Table S1, and Table S2). We validated this interaction using in vitro-translated proteins and confirmed that NPHP5 binds directly to NPHP6 via an N-terminal domain spanning amino acids 1–1207, consistent with a previously published study (Schäfer et al., 2008Schäfer T. Pütz M. Lienkamp S. Ganner A. Bergbreiter A. Ramachandran H. Gieloff V. Gerner M. Mattonet C. Czarnecki P.G. et al.Genetic and physical interaction between the NPHP5 and NPHP6 gene products.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 3655-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, NPHP6 has been shown to localize to centrosomes (Chang et al., 2006Chang B. Khanna H. Hawes N. Jimeno D. He S. Lillo C. Parapuram S.K. Cheng H. Scott A. Hurd R.E. et al.In-frame deletion in a novel centrosomal/ciliary protein CEP290/NPHP6 perturbs its interaction with RPGR and results in early-onset retinal degeneration in the rd16 mouse.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1847-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Consistently, LAP-NPHP5 and LAP-NPHP6 both colocalize with the centrosome marker pericentrin in IMCD3 cells (Figure 3C). LAP-NPHP5 also colocalizes with endogenous NPHP6, but not with the centriole-distal appendage marker OFD1 (Figure 3D). We tested whether either protein was required to recruit the other to the centrosome by siRNA depletion of NPHP5 or NPHP6. We found that NPHP5 failed to localize to the centrosome in the absence of NPHP6 (Figure 3E). In 53% of cells, LAP-NPHP5 is fully absent from pericentrin-positive centrosomes, compared to only 9% of cells transfected with a nontargeting siRNA. Conversely, depletion of NPHP5 had no effect on NPHP6 localization (data not shown). We conclude that NPHP6 binds NPHP5 and recruits NPHP5 to the centrosome. NPHP5 also interacts with other NPHP proteins. We observed copurification of NPHP5 with NPHP1-4-8 only in NIH 3T3 cells and with NPHP2 only in IMCD3 cells. These interactions were validated by co-IP in HEK293T cells but likely require additional proteins to bridge the interactions because NPHP5 does not bind directly to NPHP1, NPHP4, NPHP8, or NPHP2 in vitro (Figures 2E and 2H). In contrast to the basal body localization of NPHP5, NPHP2 was observed at the basal body but also within the primary cilium (Figure 3F). A recent study suggested that NPHP2 localized primarily to the proximal segment of the axoneme (Shiba et al., 2010Shiba D. Manning D.K. Koga H. Beier D.R. Yokoyama T. Inv acts as a molecular anchor for Nphp3 and Nek8 in the proximal segment of primary cilia.Cytoskeleton (Hoboken). 2010; 67: 112-119PubMed Google Scholar), which the authors termed the “inversin compartment.” Intriguingly, we observed NPHP2/inversin compartment in a range of extensions along the axonemal structure, beginning proximally but extending distally along the axoneme (Figures 3F and 3G and Figure S4C ). The distinct localizations of NPHP1-4-8, NPHP5-6, and NPHP2 suggest a hierarchy for how these interactions are organized. Further, the connections between these modules vary notably among IMCD3, RPE, and NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that these modules may have distinct organization and functions in polarized epithelial cells not seen in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2049275721,"We describe a general computational method for designing proteins that bind a surface patch of interest on a target macromolecule. Favorable interactions between disembodied amino acid residues and the target surface are identified and used to anchor de novo designed interfaces. The method was used to design proteins that bind a conserved surface patch on the stem of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus. After affinity maturation, two of the designed proteins, HB36 and HB80, bind H1 and H5 HAs with low nanomolar affinity. Further, HB80 inhibits the HA fusogenic conformational changes induced at low pH. The crystal structure of HB36 in complex with 1918/H1 HA revealed that the actual binding interface is nearly identical to that in the computational design model. Such designed binding proteins may be useful for both diagnostics and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2014885180,"Class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) are signal-dependent modulators of transcription with established roles in muscle differentiation and neuronal survival. We show here that in liver, class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, 5, and 7) are phosphorylated and excluded from the nucleus by AMPK family kinases. In response to the fasting hormone glucagon, class IIa HDACs are rapidly dephosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus where they associate with the promoters of gluconeogenic enzymes such as G6Pase. In turn, HDAC4/5 recruit HDAC3, which results in the acute transcriptional induction of these genes via deacetylation and activation of FOXO family transcription factors. Loss of class IIa HDACs in murine liver results in inhibition of FOXO target genes and lowers blood glucose, resulting in increased glycogen storage. Finally, suppression of class IIa HDACs in mouse models of type 2 diabetes ameliorates hyperglycemia, suggesting that inhibitors of class I/II HDACs may be potential therapeutics for metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2118833232,"The molecular basis for p53-mediated tumor suppression remains unclear. Here, to elucidate mechanisms of p53 tumor suppression, we use knockin mice expressing an allelic series of p53 transcriptional activation mutants.

Full p53 transactivation potential is required for acute DNA-damage responses Robust transactivation of most known p53 targets is dispensable for tumor suppression p53 transactivation function is critical for tumor suppression This tumor suppression is associated with activation of a set of new target genes The facts that over half of all human cancers sustain mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene and that p53 null mice display a dramatic early-onset, completely penetrant cancer predisposition together underscore the fundamental importance of p53 for tumor suppression (Kenzelmann Broz and Attardi, 2010Kenzelmann Broz D.

Lane D. Levine A.J. Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5798) Google Scholar). p53 serves as a cellular stress sentinel, responding to myriad stresses by restricting cellular expansion under unfavorable conditions (Vousden and Prives, 2009Vousden K.H. Prives C. Blinded by the light: the growing complexity of p53.Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). The best characterized p53 functions are in inducing cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to acute DNA-damage signals. The ability of p53 to eliminate cells that have encountered acute genotoxic stress is thought to be an ancestral function, as this response is conserved through lower eukaryotes, including Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, where it is critical for culling damaged cells to preserve germline and tissue integrity (Lu and Abrams, 2006Lu W.J. Abrams J.M. Lessons from p53 in non-mammalian models.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, oncogene expression can also activate p53, leading to cellular senescence or apoptosis as safeguards against neoplasia (Vousden and Prives, 2009Vousden K.H. Prives C. Blinded by the light: the growing complexity of p53.Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). The extent to which the ability of p53 to respond to DNA damage is involved in mediating tumor suppression has been controversial. Analysis of early human neoplastic lesions has revealed molecular marks of activated DNA-damage components, leading to a model whereby oncogene-induced hyperproliferation results in replication fork collapse, DNA double-strand break formation, checkpoint kinase activation, and p53 induction to ultimately impose a barrier to tumor development (Halazonetis et al., 2008Halazonetis T.D. Gorgoulis V.G. Bartek J. An oncogene-induced DNA damage model for cancer development.Science. 2008; 319: 1352-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). However, studies in mouse models of DNA-damage-induced lymphomas and fibrosarcomas have suggested that to serve as a tumor suppressor, p53 responds not to acute DNA damage but rather to oncogene-induced expression of the p19ARF tumor suppressor, which directly activates p53 through sequestration and inhibition of its negative regulator Mdm2 (Christophorou et al., 2006Christophorou M.A. Ringshausen I. Finch A.J. Swigart L.B. Evan G.I. The pathological response to DNA damage does not contribute to p53-mediated tumour suppression.Nature. 2006; 443: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, Efeyan et al., 2006Efeyan A. Garcia-Cao I. Herranz D. Velasco-Miguel S. Serrano M. Tumour biology: policing of oncogene activity by p53.Nature. 2006; 443: 159Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A clearer understanding of the role of DNA-damage-triggered, p53-induced cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis in tumor suppression would come from elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms for p53 action in the contexts of acute DNA damage versus tumor suppression. Moreover, illuminating any distinct downstream aspects to these pathways has critical therapeutic implications, as many of the deleterious side effects of genotoxic chemotherapies result from p53-driven apoptosis in radiosensitive tissues, and therefore identifying strategies to mitigate these side effects without compromising tumor suppressor function throughout the organism would be broadly valuable for cancer therapy (Gudkov and Komarova, 2003Gudkov A.V. Komarova E.A. The role of p53 in determining sensitivity to radiotherapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The molecular underpinnings for p53 action in tumor suppression have remained elusive. p53 serves as a transcriptional activator of numerous target genes, but several other biochemical activities have also been ascribed to p53 (Green and Kroemer, 2009Green D.R. Kroemer G. Cytoplasmic functions of the tumour suppressor p53.Nature. 2009; 458: 1127-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, Vousden and Prives, 2009Vousden K.H. Prives C. Blinded by the light: the growing complexity of p53.Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). Moreover, no p53 target gene knockout mouse strain recapitulates the dramatic cancer predisposition of p53 null mice, illustrating our incomplete understanding of p53 networks involved in tumor suppression and suggesting that other pathways could be involved (Lozano and Zambetti, 2005Lozano G. Zambetti G.P. What have animal models taught us about the p53 pathway?.J. Pathol. 2005; 205: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Defining the role of transactivation in tumor suppression by p53 is complicated by the fact that p53 contains two distinct transcriptional activation domains (comprising residues 1–40 and 40–83, respectively), whose discrete functions and relative contributions to p53 function are not understood (Candau et al., 1997Candau R. Scolnick D.M. Darpino P. Ying C.Y. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L.

Parsing out the specific roles of these two domains for p53 function in vivo could reveal distinct transcriptional requirements for acute DNA-damage responses and tumor suppression and lead to the discovery of p53 target genes principally important for tumor suppression. Here, we investigate the mechanism of p53-mediated tumor suppression and its relationship to acute DNA-damage responses by deciphering the p53 transactivation requirements for function in these contexts. We generate a series of transactivation domain (TAD) mutant knockin mouse strains, with alterations in the first, second, and both TADs. Knockin mice, in which the mutant genes are expressed from the native p53 promoter, uniquely enable the study of both primary cells ex vivo and tumor development in the physiological context of the organism. Intriguingly, our studies reveal that different p53 transcriptional activation requirements, associated with different target gene expression programs, are important in the settings of acute genotoxic stress and oncogenic stimuli. Our findings thereby provide genetic evidence that the mechanisms through which p53 engages responses to these signals are different and lend fundamental new insight into the networks involved in p53-mediated tumor suppression. To decipher the discrete roles of the two p53 TADs in DNA-damage responses and tumor suppression in vivo, we generated a panel of p53 mutant knockin mouse strains with alterations in the first (p5325,26), second (p5353,54), or both TADs (p5325,26,53,54). L25Q;W26S knockin mice were generated previously, and analysis of a small set of p53 target genes in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from these mice demonstrated compromised transactivation of these genes, except Bax (Johnson et al., 2005Johnson T.M. Hammond E.M. Giaccia A. Attardi L.D. The p53QS transactivation-deficient mutant shows stress-specific apoptotic activity and induces embryonic lethality.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here, we have generated mouse strains bearing either the F53Q;F54S mutations found to incapacitate the second p53 TAD in vitro, or mutations in both TADs (L25Q;W26S;F53Q;F54S; Figures 1A–1D ) (Candau et al., 1997Candau R. Scolnick D.M. Darpino P. Ying C.Y. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L.

All alleles carried a transcriptional stop element flanked by LoxP sites (Lox-Stop-Lox or LSL) in the first p53 intron to allow regulatable p53 expression (Figures 1A–1D). To initially characterize this set of p53 TAD mutant proteins, we cultured homozygous p53LSL-mut MEFs, infected them with adenoviruses expressing Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre), and assayed p53 protein levels and localization (Figures 1E–1G). Using this approach we typically observed over 90% p53 positivity, and in all experiments, we verified widespread p53 expression in the population being examined. Furthermore, MEFs expressed p53 only after Cre introduction, indicating effective silencing of the locus by the LSL cassette (Figure 1G), and allowing us to use MEFs infected with empty adenoviruses (Ad-empty) as convenient p53 null controls. Although basal p5325,26 and p5325,26,53,54 protein levels were elevated relative to wild-type (WT) p53 levels because mutation of residues 25/26 inhibits binding of the Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase (Lin et al., 1994Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Several hydrophobic amino acids in the p53 amino-terminal domain are required for transcriptional activation, binding to mdm-2 and the adenovirus 5 E1B 55-kD protein.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), protein levels were in a physiological range, accumulating to levels only slightly higher than those of wild-type p53 after DNA damage (Figures 1F and 1G). Additionally, p5353,54 basal levels were slightly increased relative to wild-type p53, consistent with the reported contribution of residues 53/54 to the p53-Mdm2 interaction (Chi et al., 2005Chi S.W. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Ahn M.J. Kim J.S. Woo J.Y. Torizawa T. Kainosho M. Han K.H. Structural details on mdm2-p53 interaction.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38795-38802Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). All mutant proteins displayed clear nuclear localization (Figure 1G). To delineate the relative contributions of the respective TADs to overall p53 transactivation function, we examined the activity of the p53 mutants both on a genome-wide scale and quantitatively at select target genes. Initially, we performed gene expression profiling experiments using a model for oncogenic Hras (HrasV12)-driven, p53-dependent senescence in MEFs (Serrano et al., 1997Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Oncogenic ras provokes premature cell senescence associated with accumulation of p53 and p16INK4a.Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar). By comparing HrasV12;p53 wild-type and HrasV12;p53 null MEFs using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (Tusher et al., 2001Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9751) Google Scholar), we defined a group of p53-dependent genes, including numerous established p53 targets such as p21 and Mdm2 (Figure 2A ). Expression of these genes in the mutant MEFs was compared by heat map analysis and Northern blotting to reveal notable differences in the activities of the three mutants. First, expression profiles of p5353,54/53,54 cells resembled those of cells expressing wild-type p53, suggesting that p5353,54 retains p53 transactivation function (Figures 2A and 2B). In contrast, analysis of p5325,26/25,26 MEFs revealed gene expression profiles intermediate between those observed in wild-type and p53 null cells (Figure 2A). To elaborate on this pattern, we focused on individual established p53-inducible genes, to ensure analysis of direct p53 targets. This analysis demonstrated that p5325,26 merely drives extremely low-level expression of p21, Noxa, and Puma but induces efficient expression of Bax comparable to wild-type p53, suggesting that p5325,26 is severely impaired for transactivation of most but not all p53 target genes (Figures 2B and 2D). Finally, the expression profile of p5325,26,53,54/25,26,53,54 MEFs closely resembled that of p53 null MEFs, suggesting that mutation of both TADs abolishes transactivation activity (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2D). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that p53 TAD mutants bind p53 target gene promoters in cells, indicating that these mutations selectively disrupt transactivation function but not chromatin association (Figure 2C; see Figure S1A available online). qRT-PCR on DNA-damage-treated MEFs echoed the microarray results, but emphasized how minimally p5325,26 activated targets relative to p53 null MEFs and further revealed that p5325,26,53,54 retained a slight capacity to activate Bax (Figure 2D; Figure S1B). Together, our analyses identify an allelic series of p53 transactivation mutants that can be used to elucidate the contribution of different extents of transactivation to p53 biological function downstream of acute genotoxic and oncogenic stresses.Figure S1Analysis of DNA Binding and Transactivation Potential of p53 TAD Mutants, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of homozygous MEFs expressing different p53 mutants, using p53 or control antibodies. p53 null MEFs were used as an additional control to indicate the specificity of the p53 antibody.

In the face of acute genotoxic stress, p53 triggers either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis to limit the propagation of damaged cells. We first defined transactivation requirements for p53-dependent G1 cell-cycle arrest using a classical MEF model in which cell-cycle profiles are examined 18 hr after 5 Gy γ-irradiation (Kastan et al., 1992Kastan M.B.

Whereas wild-type and p5353,54/53,54 cells arrested efficiently, both p5325,26/25,26 and p5325,26,53,54/25,26,53,54 cells failed to arrest, indicating that activity of the first, but not the second, p53 TAD is essential for DNA-damage-induced G1 arrest (Figures 3A and 3B ). To assess p53 transactivation function in DNA-damage-triggered apoptosis, we examined p53-dependent apoptosis in radiosensitive tissues in vivo upon exposure to ionizing radiation (Lowe et al., 1993Lowe S.W.

Using Rosa26CreERT2 mice allowed widespread p53 expression in the small intestine and less efficient expression in the thymus upon tamoxifen administration (Figure 3C) (Ventura et al., 2007Ventura A.

Restoration of p53 function leads to tumour regression in vivo.Nature. 2007; 445: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for each p53 allele were exposed to 5 Gy of whole-body ionizing radiation, and apoptosis in the small intestine and thymus was examined 6 hr later. We found that p5325,26 failed to promote apoptosis in vivo, consistent with our previous analyses examining doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in E1A-MEFs and studies in cultured lymphocytes (Chao et al., 2000Chao C.

Transcription activity is required for p53-dependent tumor suppression.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 4397-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Figures 3D–3F). Moreover, compound mutation of both TADs did not alter this phenotype, as p5325,26,53,54 also failed to induce apoptosis. In contrast, mutation of the second TAD alone did not greatly affect p53-dependent apoptosis. Together, these experiments underscore the vital roles of the first TAD and robust transactivation for p53 to promote responses to acute DNA damage and further reveal that the second TAD plays little to no role in these responses. To elucidate p53 transactivation requirements in the context of oncogenic signals, we examined the allelic series of p53 mutants in HrasV12-induced cellular senescence (Serrano et al., 1997Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Oncogenic ras provokes premature cell senescence associated with accumulation of p53 and p16INK4a.Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar). HrasV12 was expressed in MEFs, and cell-cycle arrest was assessed by BrdU labeling. As expected, few cells with wild-type p53 incorporated BrdU, whereas those lacking p53 proliferated efficiently upon HrasV12 expression (Figure 4A ). Interestingly, both HrasV12;p5325,26/25,26 and HrasV12;p5353,54/53,54 MEFs underwent a proliferative arrest with time and displayed hallmarks of cellular senescence, including flattened, enlarged morphologies and both transcriptional induction of Pml and widespread Pml nuclear body accumulation (de Stanchina et al., 2004de Stanchina E. Querido E. Narita M. Davuluri R.V. Pandolfi P.P. Ferbeyre G. Lowe S.W. PML is a direct p53 target that modulates p53 effector functions.Mol.

PML is induced by oncogenic ras and promotes premature senescence.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures 4A–4C and 4E, Figures S2A and S2B ). Additionally, all arresting cells displayed strong nuclear staining for the histone variant macroH2A, another indicator of senescence (Kennedy et al., 2010Kennedy A.L. McBryan T. Enders G.H. Johnson F.B. Zhang R. Adams P.D. Senescent mouse cells fail to overtly regulate the HIRA histone chaperone and do not form robust Senescence Associated Heterochromatin Foci.Cell Div. 2010; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Figure 4D). Unlike their wild-type and p5353,54/53,54 counterparts, however, senescent p5325,26/25,26 cells were negative for SA-β-galactosidase, another common senescence marker (Dimri et al., 1995Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. et al.A biomarker that identifies senescent human cells in culture and in aging skin in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar), suggesting that full p53 transactivation potential is essential for this activity (Figure 4E). Thus, despite being highly impaired for transactivation of most p53 target genes, including the senescence-relevant targets p21 and Pai-1 (Brown et al., 1997Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Bypass of senescence after disruption of p21CIP1/WAF1 gene in normal diploid human fibroblasts.Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, Kortlever et al., 2006Kortlever R.M.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) (Figure 4B), p5325,26 can induce senescence in the context of oncogenic signals. This surprising finding indicates that full p53 transactivation potential is dispensable for p53 to promote senescence. While either single TAD mutant alone was able to induce senescence, mutation of both domains completely reversed this phenotype, as indicated by the high level of proliferation throughout the time course, the paucity of Pml bodies, and the absence of macroH2A staining in HrasV12;p5325,26,53,54/25,26,53,54 cells, mimicking HrasV12;p53−/− MEFs (Figures 4A, 4C, and 4D). The observation that p5325,26,53,54 cannot engage the senescence program indicates that, although the full p53 transactivation program is dispensable, some limited level of p53 transactivation is required for promoting senescence. Together, our findings suggest fundamentally distinct requirements for transcriptional activation between the acute DNA damage and senescence responses: full p53 transactivation is paramount for proper p53 action downstream of genotoxic stress, in both G1 checkpoint function and apoptosis, whereas more selective p53 transactivation function suffices for senescence.Figure S2Detailed Analysis of Senescence Markers in HrasV12 MEFs, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Low magnification images of Pml staining in HrasV12 MEFs to highlight population-wide Pml nuclear body accumulation in genotypes of cells undergoing cell-cycle arrest.

To identify the mechanisms of p53 action downstream of oncogenic signals in vivo, we interrogated the contribution of p53 transactivation to tumor suppression. We employed a model for human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) driven by expression of oncogenic KrasG12D from its endogenous promoter after Cre-mediated excision of an upstream Lox-Stop-Lox element (Jackson et al., 2001Jackson E.L. Willis N. Mercer K. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Montoya R. Jacks T. Tuveson D.A. Analysis of lung tumor initiation and progression using conditional expression of oncogenic K-ras.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3243-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). p53 loss promotes the progression of these Kras-driven lung tumors to more advanced lesions, making this an optimal system to query the mechanism of p53 action (Jackson et al., 2001Jackson E.L. Willis N. Mercer K. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Montoya R. Jacks T. Tuveson D.A.

Cohorts of KrasLSL-G12D/+ mice homozygous for the different p53 alleles were subjected to intranasal Ad-Cre instillation, and tumor burden was assessed 12 weeks later. KrasG12D/+;p53−/− mice exhibited visible tumors studding the lung surfaces, while lungs from KrasG12D/+;p53+/+ mice appeared grossly normal (Figures 5A and 5B ). Additionally, the average tumor burden was dramatically increased in KrasG12D/+;p53−/− mice compared to KrasG12D/+;p53+/+ mice (Figures 5C and 5D).

https://openalex.org/W2002784005,"Activating mutations in the Notch pathway promote tumorigenesis in T-cell leukaemias. Iannis Aifantis and colleagues now find that the same pathway suppresses the development of myeloid leukaemias. Inactivating the pathway in haematopoietic stem cells leads to myeloid disease resembling chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), and mutations in Notch pathway genes can be found in patients with CMML. The Notch pathway is shown to suppress a myeloid differentiation program. These findings demonstrate that the Notch pathway exerts both oncogenic and tumour-suppressor functions in the haematopoietic system and regulates critical cell-fate decisions. Notch signalling is a central regulator of differentiation in a variety of organisms and tissue types1. Its activity is controlled by the multi-subunit γ-secretase (γSE) complex2. Although Notch signalling can play both oncogenic and tumour-suppressor roles in solid tumours, in the haematopoietic system it is exclusively oncogenic, notably in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a disease characterized by Notch1-activating mutations3. Here we identify novel somatic-inactivating Notch pathway mutations in a fraction of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Inactivation of Notch signalling in mouse haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) results in an aberrant accumulation of granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMPs), extramedullary haematopoieisis and the induction of CMML-like disease. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Notch signalling regulates an extensive myelomonocytic-specific gene signature, through the direct suppression of gene transcription by the Notch target Hes1. Our studies identify a novel role for Notch signalling during early haematopoietic stem cell differentiation and suggest that the Notch pathway can play both tumour-promoting and -suppressive roles within the same tissue."

Under normal conditions, microglia are maintained in a quiescent state by neuron and astrocyte-derived factors (Cardona et al., 2006Cardona A.E. Pioro E.P. Sasse M.E. Kostenko V. Cardona S.M.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar), and constantly survey the surrounding environment through an extensive array of ramified processes (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005Nimmerjahn A. Kirchhoff F. Helmchen F. Resting microglial cells are highly dynamic surveillants of brain parenchyma in vivo.Science. 2005; 308: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar). Upon detection of microbial invasion or evidence of tissue damage, microglia rapidly initiate an inflammatory response that serves to recruit the immune system and tissue repair processes. Microglia sense infection and injury through numerous pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLR), that regulate the activities of NF-κB, AP-1 and other signal-dependent transcription factors (Akira et al., 2006Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity.Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7876) Google Scholar). These transcription factors act in a combinatorial manner to induce a robust program of gene expression that initiates innate and adaptive immune responses (Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Regulation and function of NF-kappaB transcription factors in the immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). Astrocytes also sense infection and injury, and amplify the immune reaction initiated by microglia (Saijo et al., 2009Saijo K. Winner B. Carson C.T. Collier J.G. Boyer L. Rosenfeld M.G. Gage F.H.

Microglia/astrocyte activation is required for effective immune responses, but the inflammatory program that is induced by these cells also has the potential to cause neuronal dysfunction and death if inflammatory responses are not properly resolved. Deregulation of inflammatory responses by microglia and astrocytes has been suggested to contribute to the severity of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, HIV-associated dementia and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) (Glass et al., 2010Glass C.K.

Estrogens and synthetic estrogen receptor (ER) ligands have been documented to exert anti-inflammatory effects in animal models for MS (Gold and Voskuhl, 2009Gold S.M. Voskuhl R.R.

Roles of estrogens and their receptors in the brain are particularly complex. Two members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, estrogen receptor (ER), ERα (NR3A1) and ERβ (NR3A2), bind to 17β-estradiol and activate estrogen-regulated target genes (Kuiper et al., 1996Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Cloning of a novel receptor expressed in rat prostate and ovary.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 1032-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). ERα is highly expressed in female reproductive organs and plays major roles in mediating the reproductive and sexually dimorphic effects of estrogens in females. ERβ also regulates reproductive functions, but exhibits a distinct pattern of expression. Both ERβ and ERα are expressed in the brain, with differential levels of expression observed in specific regions (Kuiper et al., 1997Kuiper G.G. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J.

Neurobiol. 1998; 36: 357-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The relative expression levels and functions of ERα and ERβ in specific subsets of microglia, astrocytes and neurons have not been established. Although the DNA binding domains (DBDs) of ERα and ERβ are highly conserved (98% identity in human), their ligand-binding domains (LBDs) exhibit less conservation (59% identity in human), and ERβ binds selectively a distinct spectrum of naturally occurring as well as synthetic and plant-derived steroids (Kuiper et al., 1997Kuiper G.G. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E. Haggblad J. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Comparison of the ligand binding specificity and transcript tissue distribution of estrogen receptors alpha and beta.Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (3678) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, it has been possible to develop synthetic ligands that exhibit preferential affinity for ERα or ERβ (Minutolo et al., 2009Minutolo F. Macchia M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Estrogen receptor beta ligands: Recent advances and biomedical applications. Med Res Rev, 2009Google Scholar). Anti-inflammatory effects of estrogens and ER-selective ligands within the CNS have been extensively evaluated in the context of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS (Gold and Voskuhl, 2009Gold S.M.

Therapeutic mechanisms include anti-inflammatory effects in antigen presenting cells as well as neurotrophic effects. Estrogen represses several proinflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in dendritic cells (Gold et al., 2009Gold S.M. Sasidhar M.V. Morales L.B. Du S.

Estrogen blocks inducible nitric oxide synthase accumulation in LPS-activated microglia cells.Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The protective effect of estrogen requires ERα, since it is not observed in ERα knockout mice (Gold and Voskuhl, 2009Gold S.M. Voskuhl R.R. Estrogen treatment in multiple sclerosis.J. Neurol. Sci. 2009; 286: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, treatment with the ERβ-selective ligand 2,3-bis (4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) was also recently shown to be protective in the EAE model (Tiwari-Woodruff et al., 2007Tiwari-Woodruff S. Morales L.B. Lee R. Voskuhl R.R. Differential neuroprotective and antiinflammatory effects of estrogen receptor (ER)alpha and ERbeta ligand treatment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 14813-14818Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This effect was not associated with anti-inflammatory activity, but rather was proposed to be due to ERβ ligands acting on neurons to promote survival and preserve myelination. Here, we report that synthetic ERβ-specific ligands based on a halogen-substituted phenyl-2H-indazole core (referred to hereafter as Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl) (De Angelis et al., 2005De Angelis M. Stossi F. Carlson K.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Indazole estrogens: highly selective ligands for the estrogen receptor beta.J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 1132-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) potently inhibit transcriptional activation of inflammatory response genes in microglia and astrocytes. This observation led to the identification of an ERβ-specific transrepression pathway that we propose is controlled endogenously by regulated production of 5-androsten-3β,17β-diol (ADIOL). 17β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 14 (HSD17B14), a member of HSD17B-family, converts 5- androsten-3β-ol-17-one (dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA) to ADIOL, and the expression of HSD17B14 itself is controlled by inducers and inhibitors of inflammatory responses. Lack of this enzyme or ERβ results in exaggerated inflammatory responses in microglia and astrocytes. These findings suggest that an ADIOL-ERβ-CtBP repression pathway may play roles in the maintenance of CNS homeostasis by regulating the magnitude and duration of inflammatory responses. Quantitative analysis of nuclear receptor expression in primary mouse and human microglia indicated high levels of ERβ transcripts and relatively low levels of ERα transcripts (Figures S1A and S1B available online). The murine BV2 microglia cell line selectively expressed ERβ (Figure S1C), in agreement with a previous report (Baker et al., 2004Baker A.E. Brautigam V.M. Watters J.J. Estrogen modulates microglial inflammatory mediator production via interactions with estrogen receptor beta.Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5021-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of BV2 cells, we first tested several ERβ-specific synthetic ligands for their effects on LPS-dependent activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene. Notably Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl (Figure S1D) (De Angelis et al., 2005De Angelis M. Stossi F. Carlson K.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A.

Knockdown of ERβ expression using a specific small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) abolished the Indazole-Cl-mediated repression of iNOS mRNA expression upon LPS stimulation (Figure 1B and Figure S1E).

Several lines of evidence suggest that Th17 T cells play essential roles in focal autoimmune diseases including MS (Korn et al., 2009Korn T. Bettelli E. Oukka M. Kuchroo V.K.

The differentiation and activation of Th17 T cells requires specific combinations of cytokines provided by antigen presenting cells such as Transforming growth factor (TGF)β, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IL-23 for mice (Ghoreschi et al., 2010Ghoreschi K.

Since microglia have been suggested to perform an essential role in the onset of EAE (Heppner et al., 2005Heppner F.L. Greter M. Marino D. Falsig J. Raivich G. Hovelmeyer N. Waisman A. Rulicke T.

Neuroendocrinol. 2008; 29: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we tested whether Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl could repress those cytokines required for the differentiation and activation of Th17 T cells. In BV2 cells, Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl significantly repressed the mRNA expression of IL-23p19 (Figure 1C), IL-6 (Figure 1D), and IL-1β (Figure 1E) that are required for the differentiation and activation of Th17 T cells, but not TGFβ, which is important also for the differentiation of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Figure 1F) (Littman and Rudensky, 2010Littman D.R. Rudensky A.Y. Th17 and regulatory T cells in mediating and restraining inflammation.Cell. 2010; 140: 845-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Indazole-Cl repressed IL-6 expression with an EC50 value of ∼30-100 nM in BV2 cells (Figure S1G). Similarly, Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl repressed IL-23p19 and IL-6 in primary mouse microglia cells (Figures S1H and S1I). It was reported that IL-1β, but not IL-6, is required for the differentiation of human Th17 cells (Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007Acosta-Rodriguez E.V. Napolitani G. Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F. Interleukins 1beta and 6 but not transforming growth factor-beta are essential for the differentiation of interleukin 17-producing human T helper cells.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 942-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar, Wilson et al., 2007Wilson N.J. Boniface K. Chan J.R. McKenzie B.S. Blumenschein W.M. Mattson J.D. Basham B. Smith K. Chen T. Morel F. et al.Development, cytokine profile and function of human interleukin 17-producing helper T cells.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also tested whether the Indazoles repressed these cytokines in human microglia cells. Indazoles significantly repressed the mRNA expression of IL-1β (Figure 1G) and IL-23p19 (Figure 1H) to a greater extent than 17β-estradiol. In contrast, 17β-estradiol, but not Indazoles, suppressed expression of TGFβ in human primary microglia (Figure S1J). Next, we tested ERβ-dependency of Indazole-mediated repression of IL-1β, using siRNAs specific for ERβ and ERα. Transfection of siRNAs specifically targeting ERβ abolished Indazole-Cl-mediated repression of IL-1β (Figure S1K-M). In contrast, transfection of siRNAs against ERα did not show any reversal of Indazole-Cl-mediated repression. Thus, Indazole-Cl-mediated repression of proinflammatory genes in human microglia cells is also mediated by ERβ. Finally, we measured cytokine secretion by mouse and human microglia cells by ELISA. Consistent with mRNA data, the production of IL-6 and IL-23 were strongly induced by LPS stimulation, and both Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl significantly inhibited their secretion (Figures 1I and 1J), with corresponding effects on IL-1β in human microglia (Figure 1K). These data indicate that, in contrast to 17β-estradiol, Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl act to strongly suppress the production of proinflammatory mediators in response to LPS, including those required for the differentiation and activation of Th17 T cells. Astrocytes also contribute to inflammatory responses and have been reported to be a major source of BAFF (also known as BLyS/TNFSF13B) (Krumbholz et al., 2005Krumbholz M. Theil D. Derfuss T. Rosenwald A. Schrader F. Monoranu C.M. Kalled S.L. Hess D.M. Serafini B. Aloisi F. et al.BAFF is produced by astrocytes and up-regulated in multiple sclerosis lesions and primary central nervous system lymphoma.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), which supports the survival of potential auto-reactive B cells (Mackay and Browning, 2002Mackay F. Browning J.L. BAFF: a fundamental survival factor for B cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Since both human and mouse primary astrocytes express high levels of ERβ (Figure S2A and B), we next examined whether the Indazoles repressed inflammatory responses in these cells. Activated mouse and human astrocytes upregulated mRNA expression of BAFF when stimulated by IL-1β, consistent with previous reports, and Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl, but not 17β-estradiol, significantly repressed this response (Figures 2A and 2D ). Similarly, Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl suppressed IL1β-induced expression of IL-23p19 and iNOS mRNAs in mouse and human astrocytes (Figures 2B, 2C, 2E, and 2F). Although, the expression of ERα in astrocytes is significantly lower than ERβ, we confirmed that Indazole-mediated repression was indeed ERβ-dependent by knocking down ERα or ERβ expression using specific siRNAs (Figure S2C ). As shown in Figure 2G, knockdown of ERβ expression, but not ERα expression, reverted Indazole-Cl-mediated repression of BAFF mRNA expression. Notably, siRNA knockdown of ERβ resulted in a marked increase in induced BAFF expression. Finally, the Greiss reaction was used to determine effects of ERβ ligands on IL-1β-induced NO production. Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl, but not 17β-estradiol, inhibited IL-1β-induced production of NO in human astrocytes (Figure 2H).Figure S2Expression of ERα and ERβ mRNA in Primary Mouse and Human AstrocytesShow full captionExpression of ERα and ERβ in mouse (A) and human (B) primary astrocytes as determined by qPCR and normalized to HPRT expression.(C) Efficiency of knock down of ERα and ERβ in primary human astrocytes by specific siRNAs as determined by qPCR normalized to HPRT expression. ∗p < 0.01 compared to control (Ctrl) sample.

To determine whether Indazoles could inhibit inflammation in the brain, we monitored the effect of Indazole-Cl treatment on the expression of proinflammatory genes in the substantia nigra following injection of LPS into the peritoneal cavity (Figure 3A ), which induces both systemic and CNS inflammation (Bhaskar et al., 2010Bhaskar K. Konerth M. Kokiko-Cochran O.N. Cardona A. Ransohoff R.M. Lamb B.T.

Indazole-Cl treatment suppressed induction of IL-6 in the substantia nigra (Figure 3A), but did not suppress iNOS induction in the bone marrow (Figure S3A ), consistent with high expression of ERβ in microglia and astrocytes, but low expression in myeloid cells. Based on the ability of Indazole-Br and Indazole-Cl to repress induction of factors in microglia that promote Th17 T cell differentiation and activation, and the established roles of microglia in the onset of EAE (Heppner et al., 2005Heppner F.L.

https://openalex.org/W1970083434,"Under fasting conditions, metazoans maintain energy balance by shifting from glucose to fat burning. In the fasted state, SIRT1 promotes catabolic gene expression by deacetylating the forkhead factor FOXO in response to stress and nutrient deprivation. The mechanisms by which hormonal signals regulate FOXO deacetylation remain unclear, however. We identified a hormone-dependent module, consisting of the Ser/Thr kinase SIK3 and the class IIa deacetylase HDAC4, which regulates FOXO activity in Drosophila. During feeding, HDAC4 is phosphorylated and sequestered in the cytoplasm by SIK3, whose activity is upregulated in response to insulin. SIK3 is inactivated during fasting, leading to the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of HDAC4 and to FOXO deacetylation. SIK3 mutant flies are starvation sensitive, reflecting FOXO-dependent increases in lipolysis that deplete triglyceride stores; reducing HDAC4 expression restored lipid accumulation. Our results reveal a hormone-regulated pathway that functions in parallel with the nutrient-sensing SIRT1 pathway to maintain energy balance."

https://openalex.org/W2061148345,"Dietary restriction can extend lifespan in model organisms such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Although a number of key players in lifespan extension have been identified, little is known about the signals that coordinate the metabolic response of the organism. The endocannabinoid system is one candidate for the role, as it is known to regulate nutrient intake and energy balance in mammals. These pathways, and cannabinoid receptors, are absent in C. elegans, but a possible alternative has now been identified in this important model for ageing studies. Abundance of a class of lipid-derived signalling molecules, the N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), is reduced in C. elegans by dietary restriction, and NAE deficiency alone is sufficient to extend lifespan. In mammals, an arachidonic acid containing NAE elicits many — though not all — of its effects through cannabinoid receptors. Dietary restriction is a robust means of extending adult lifespan and postponing age-related disease in many species, including yeast, nematode worms, flies and rodents1,2. Studies of the genetic requirements for lifespan extension by dietary restriction in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have implicated a number of key molecules in this process3,4,5, including the nutrient-sensing target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway6 and the Foxa transcription factor PHA-4 (ref. 7). However, little is known about the metabolic signals that coordinate the organismal response to dietary restriction and maintain homeostasis when nutrients are limited. The endocannabinoid system is an excellent candidate for such a role given its involvement in regulating nutrient intake and energy balance8. Despite this, a direct role for endocannabinoid signalling in dietary restriction or lifespan determination has yet to be demonstrated, in part due to the apparent absence of endocannabinoid signalling pathways in model organisms that are amenable to lifespan analysis9. N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are lipid-derived signalling molecules, which include the mammalian endocannabinoid arachidonoyl ethanolamide. Here we identify NAEs in C. elegans, show that NAE abundance is reduced under dietary restriction and that NAE deficiency is sufficient to extend lifespan through a dietary restriction mechanism requiring PHA-4. Conversely, dietary supplementation with the nematode NAE eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide not only inhibits dietary-restriction-induced lifespan extension in wild-type worms, but also suppresses lifespan extension in a TOR pathway mutant. This demonstrates a role for NAE signalling in ageing and indicates that NAEs represent a signal that coordinates nutrient status with metabolic changes that ultimately determine lifespan."

Strontium ranelate is a treatment for osteoporosis that has been shown to reduce fracture risk, in part, by increasing bone formation. Here we show that exposure of human osteoblasts in primary culture to strontium increased mineralization and decreased the expression of sclerostin, an osteocyte-specific secreted protein that acts as a negative regulator of bone formation by inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling. Strontium also activated, in an apparently separate process, an Akt-dependent signaling cascade via the calcium-sensing receptor that promoted the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. We propose that two discrete pathways linked to canonical Wnt signaling contribute to strontium-induced osteogenic effects in osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1981526758,"Many proteins are translocated through the SecY channel in bacteria and archaea and through the related Sec61 channel in eukaryotes. The channel has an hourglass shape with a narrow constriction approximately halfway across the membrane, formed by a pore ring of amino acids. While the cytoplasmic cavity of the channel is empty, the extracellular cavity is filled with a short helix called the plug, which moves out of the way during protein translocation. The mechanism by which the channel transports large polypeptides and yet prevents the passage of small molecules, such as ions or metabolites, has been controversial. Here, we have addressed this issue in intact Escherichia coli cells by testing the permeation of small molecules through wild-type and mutant SecY channels, which are either in the resting state or contain a defined translocating polypeptide chain. We show that in the resting state, the channel is sealed by both the pore ring and the plug domain. During translocation, the pore ring forms a 'gasket-like' seal around the polypeptide chain, preventing the permeation of small molecules. The structural conservation of the channel in all organisms indicates that this may be a universal mechanism by which the membrane barrier is maintained during protein translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2016849440,"Osteolytic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteomyelitis, and periodontitis, are usually associated with bacterial infections. However, the precise mechanisms by which bacteria induce bone loss still remain unclear. Evidence exists that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling regulates both inflammation and bone metabolism and that the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and its receptor RANK are the key regulators for bone remodeling and for the activation of osteoclasts. Here, we investigate the direct effects of the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis on osteoclast differentiation and show that P. gingivalis differentially modulates RANKL-induced osteoclast formation contingent on the state of differentiation of osteoclast precursors. In addition, although an optimal induction of cytokines by P. gingivalis is dependent on TLR2 and TLR4, as well as myeloid differentiation factor 88 and Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β, P. gingivalis utilizes TLR2/ myeloid differentiation factor 88 in modulating osteoclast differentiation. P. gingivalis modulates RANKL-induced osteoclast formation by differential induction of NFATc1 and c-Fos. More importantly, RANKL-mediated lineage commitment also has an impact on P. gingivalis-induced cytokine production. RANKL inhibits P. gingivalis-induced cytokine production by down-regulation of TLR/NF-κB and up-regulation of NFATc1. Our findings reveal novel aspects of the interactions between TLR and RANK signaling and provide a new model for understanding the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of bacteria-mediated bone loss."
https://openalex.org/W2115552263,"Structural studies showed that Dnmt3a has two interfaces for protein-protein interaction in the heterotetrameric Dnmt3a/3L C-terminal domain complex: the RD interface (mediating the Dnmt3a-3a contact) and the FF interface (mediating the Dnmt3a-3L contact). Here, we demonstrate that Dnmt3a-C forms dimers via the FF interface as well, which further oligomerize via their RD interfaces. Each RD interface of the Dnmt3a-C oligomer creates an independent DNA binding site, which allows for binding of separate DNA molecules oriented in parallel. Because Dnmt3L does not have an RD interface, it prevents Dnmt3a oligomerization and binding of more than one DNA molecule. Both interfaces of Dnmt3a are necessary for the heterochromatic localization of the enzyme in cells.

The Dnmt3a C-terminal domain provides two interfaces for protein-protein contacts: one hydrophobic FF interface at the Dnmt3a-C/3L-C contact formed by the stacking interaction of four phenylalanine residues (two from each subunit) and one polar RD interface at the Dnmt3a-C/3a-C contact mediated by a hydrogen bonding network between arginine and aspartate residues. The RD interface forms the DNA binding site, while both interfaces are essential for cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding and catalytic activity of the enzyme (38Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 40Jurkowska R.Z. Anspach N. Urbanke C. Jia D. Reinhardt R. Nellen W. Cheng X. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6656-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that Dnmt3a-C oligomerizes in a reversible manner. Initial dimer formation occurs through the FF interface, further oligomerization via the RD interface of the FF dimers. Because each RD interface constitutes an independent DNA binding site, Dnmt3a-C oligomers can bind to two or more DNA molecules, oriented next to each other, roughly in parallel. Dnmt3L prevents this oligomerization, because it lacks the RD interface, and it therefore precludes binding of Dnmt3a to more than one DNA molecule. The formation of Dnmt3a oligomers is required for the localization of the enzyme to heterochromatin, and binding of Dnmt3L changes the subnuclear localization of Dnmt3a, which could be one mechanism describing how Dnmt3L stimulates the methylation of imprinted loci.DISCUSSIONThe Dnmt3a C-terminal domain employs two interfaces for protein/protein contacts in the structure of the Dnmt3a/Dnmt3L heterotetrameric complex: one FF interface and one RD interface. We show here that the FF interface also supports self-interaction of Dnmt3a-C and that Dnmt3a-C dimers can form protein oligomers using their RD interfaces. Since each RD interface constitutes a potential DNA binding site, oligomerization of Dnmt3a creates several DNA binding sites. Our modeling of a Dnmt3a oligomer predicted binding to several DNA molecules oriented next to each other roughly in parallel (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2B). We document this unusual mode of DNA binding to Dnmt3a-C oligomers by binding experiments performed in solution (FRET) and imaging (SFM). Binding of two DNA molecules in parallel orientation so far has been observed only with few proteins (one noticeable example being RecA (50Bell C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) and such DNA binding mode was not anticipated for Dnmt3a.Dnmt3a has been shown to bind tightly to chromatin (21Jeong S.

It is engaged in two interactions with the H3 tail, mediated by its ADD domain binding to the end of the H3 tail unmodified at K4 (29Otani J. Nankumo T. Arita K. Inamoto S. Ariyoshi M. Shirakawa M. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 30Zhang Y. Jurkowska R. Soeroes S. Rajavelu A. Dhayalan A. Bock I. Rathert P. Brandt O. Reinhardt R. Fischle W. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and by its PWWP domain binding to H3K36me3, which was found to be essential for heterochromatic localization (31Dhayalan A.

In addition, Dnmt3a polymerizes on the DNA (38Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 40Jurkowska R.Z. Anspach N. Urbanke C. Jia D. Reinhardt R. Nellen W. Cheng X. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6656-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and we show here that Dnmt3a oligomers bind to several DNA molecules oriented in parallel. Since heterochromatin is defined as a region of very high DNA density, the ability of Dnmt3a oligomers to bind to parallel DNA close to each other may contributes to the targeting of the enzyme to such DNA dense regions. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that heterochromatic localization of Dnmt3a was lost with non-oligomerizing Dnmt3a mutants affected at the FF interface and in the presence of Dnmt3L, which disrupts oligomerization and multiple DNA binding because it lacks an RD interface. The structure of heterochromatic DNA is not known. However, at least one model of the 30 nm chromatin fiber, the helical ribbon model (51Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), proposes an almost parallel arrangement of the linker DNA regions in a spacing that would fit to the model of the Dnmt3a oligomers binding to parallel DNA molecules. Hence, the unusual DNA binding mode of Dnmt3a could represent a novel mechanism of heterochromatic targeting.We have shown that Dnmt3L disrupts the reversible oligomerization of Dnmt3a-C and it interferes with the simultaneous binding to several DNA molecules to Dnmt3a. We investigated the influence of Dnmt3L on the subnuclear localization of Dnmt3a. Strikingly, more than 60% of the cells lost the heterochromatic localization of Dnmt3a in the presence of Dnmt3L, but not when Dnmt3a was co-expressed with the Dnmt3L F261D mutant, which partially lost its ability to interact with Dnmt3a. This observation suggests a novel mode of action of Dnmt3L in setting DNA methylation imprints. In addition to stimulating the activity of Dnmt3a, it might be involved in the release of Dnmt3a from dense heterochromatin to make it available to act at imprinted differentially methylated regions, which are generally located in euchromatin. The expression of Dnmt3L in germ line cells may redistribute Dnmt3a from heterochromatin to euchromatin and, thereby, increase Dnmt3a availability and DNA methylation activity for the generation of DNA methylation imprints.

Dnmt3 proteins comprise two parts: a large multidomain N-terminal part of variable size, which has regulatory and targeting functions and a C-terminal catalytic part. The N-terminal part of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b contains two defined domains: a cysteine-rich ADD (ATRX–DNMT3–DNMT3L) domain, which binds to H3 tails unmodified at K4 (29Otani J. Nankumo T. Arita K.

The structure of a complex consisting of the C-terminal parts of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3L (Dnmt3a-C/Dnmt3L-C) revealed a linear heterotetramer, in which the two Dnmt3L subunits are positioned at the edges and two Dnmt3a molecules in the center (Fig. 1A) (38Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 39Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. Structure. 2008; 16: 341-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The Dnmt3a C-terminal domain provides two interfaces for protein-protein contacts: one hydrophobic FF interface at the Dnmt3a-C/3L-C contact formed by the stacking interaction of four phenylalanine residues (two from each subunit) and one polar RD interface at the Dnmt3a-C/3a-C contact mediated by a hydrogen bonding network between arginine and aspartate residues. The RD interface forms the DNA binding site, while both interfaces are essential for cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding and catalytic activity of the enzyme (38Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 40Jurkowska R.Z. Anspach N. Urbanke C. Jia D. Reinhardt R. Nellen W. Cheng X. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6656-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that Dnmt3a-C oligomerizes in a reversible manner. Initial dimer formation occurs through the FF interface, further oligomerization via the RD interface of the FF dimers. Because each RD interface constitutes an independent DNA binding site, Dnmt3a-C oligomers can bind to two or more DNA molecules, oriented next to each other, roughly in parallel. Dnmt3L prevents this oligomerization, because it lacks the RD interface, and it therefore precludes binding of Dnmt3a to more than one DNA molecule. The formation of Dnmt3a oligomers is required for the localization of the enzyme to heterochromatin, and binding of Dnmt3L changes the subnuclear localization of Dnmt3a, which could be one mechanism describing how Dnmt3L stimulates the methylation of imprinted loci. DISCUSSIONThe Dnmt3a C-terminal domain employs two interfaces for protein/protein contacts in the structure of the Dnmt3a/Dnmt3L heterotetrameric complex: one FF interface and one RD interface. We show here that the FF interface also supports self-interaction of Dnmt3a-C and that Dnmt3a-C dimers can form protein oligomers using their RD interfaces. Since each RD interface constitutes a potential DNA binding site, oligomerization of Dnmt3a creates several DNA binding sites. Our modeling of a Dnmt3a oligomer predicted binding to several DNA molecules oriented next to each other roughly in parallel (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2B). We document this unusual mode of DNA binding to Dnmt3a-C oligomers by binding experiments performed in solution (FRET) and imaging (SFM). Binding of two DNA molecules in parallel orientation so far has been observed only with few proteins (one noticeable example being RecA (50Bell C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) and such DNA binding mode was not anticipated for Dnmt3a.Dnmt3a has been shown to bind tightly to chromatin (21Jeong S. Liang G. Sharma S. Lin J.C. Choi S.H. Han H. Yoo C.B. Egger G. Yang A.S. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 5366-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is engaged in two interactions with the H3 tail, mediated by its ADD domain binding to the end of the H3 tail unmodified at K4 (29Otani J. Nankumo T. Arita K. Inamoto S. Ariyoshi M. Shirakawa M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and by its PWWP domain binding to H3K36me3, which was found to be essential for heterochromatic localization (31Dhayalan A.

In addition, Dnmt3a polymerizes on the DNA (38Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 40Jurkowska R.Z. Anspach N. Urbanke C. Jia D. Reinhardt R. Nellen W. Cheng X. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6656-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and we show here that Dnmt3a oligomers bind to several DNA molecules oriented in parallel. Since heterochromatin is defined as a region of very high DNA density, the ability of Dnmt3a oligomers to bind to parallel DNA close to each other may contributes to the targeting of the enzyme to such DNA dense regions. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that heterochromatic localization of Dnmt3a was lost with non-oligomerizing Dnmt3a mutants affected at the FF interface and in the presence of Dnmt3L, which disrupts oligomerization and multiple DNA binding because it lacks an RD interface. The structure of heterochromatic DNA is not known. However, at least one model of the 30 nm chromatin fiber, the helical ribbon model (51Dorigo B. Schalch T. Kulangara A. Duda S. Schroeder R.R. Richmond T.J. Science. 2004; 306: 1571-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), proposes an almost parallel arrangement of the linker DNA regions in a spacing that would fit to the model of the Dnmt3a oligomers binding to parallel DNA molecules. Hence, the unusual DNA binding mode of Dnmt3a could represent a novel mechanism of heterochromatic targeting.We have shown that Dnmt3L disrupts the reversible oligomerization of Dnmt3a-C and it interferes with the simultaneous binding to several DNA molecules to Dnmt3a. We investigated the influence of Dnmt3L on the subnuclear localization of Dnmt3a. Strikingly, more than 60% of the cells lost the heterochromatic localization of Dnmt3a in the presence of Dnmt3L, but not when Dnmt3a was co-expressed with the Dnmt3L F261D mutant, which partially lost its ability to interact with Dnmt3a. This observation suggests a novel mode of action of Dnmt3L in setting DNA methylation imprints. In addition to stimulating the activity of Dnmt3a, it might be involved in the release of Dnmt3a from dense heterochromatin to make it available to act at imprinted differentially methylated regions, which are generally located in euchromatin. The expression of Dnmt3L in germ line cells may redistribute Dnmt3a from heterochromatin to euchromatin and, thereby, increase Dnmt3a availability and DNA methylation activity for the generation of DNA methylation imprints. The Dnmt3a C-terminal domain employs two interfaces for protein/protein contacts in the structure of the Dnmt3a/Dnmt3L heterotetrameric complex: one FF interface and one RD interface.

Forward and reverse transport directions were investigated at zero membrane potential using preparations with inside-out and right side-out-oriented transporters with Na+ or H+ gradients as the driving force. Under symmetrical pH conditions with a Na+ gradient for activation, both the wt and the pH-shifted G338S variant exhibit highly symmetrical transport activity with bell-shaped pH dependences, but the optimal pH was shifted 1.8 pH units to the acidic range in the variant. In both strains the pH dependence was associated with a systematic increase of the Km for Na+ at acidic pH. Under symmetrical Na+ concentration with a pH gradient for NhaA activation, an unexpected novel characteristic of the antiporter was revealed; rather than being down-regulated, it remained active even at pH as low as 5. These data allowed a transport mechanism to advance based on competing Na+ and H+ binding to a common transport site and a kinetic model to develop quantitatively explaining the experimental results. In support of these results, both alkaline pH and Na+ induced the conformational change of NhaA associated with NhaA cation translocation as demonstrated here by trypsin digestion. Furthermore, Na+ translocation was found to be associated with the displacement of a negative charge.

The Na+/H+ exchanger NhaA is essential for the Na+ and H+ homeostasis in Escherichia coli (1Padan E. Bibi E. Ito M. Krulwich T.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Compared with other transporters, its transport capacity is extremely high. Turnover numbers of up to 1000 s−1 have been reported (3Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

The pH dependence of the transporter activity is paralleled with conformational changes of the enzyme, which could be monitored with various techniques like tryptic digestion (5Rothman A. Gerchman Y.

In general, secondary active transporters are believed to function according to an alternative access model (17Jardetzky O.

This could be a rocker switch-like domain movement in the protein as proposed for the sugar/H+ cotransporter LacY (18Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) or a more subtle one-helix bending or displacement as proposed for NhaA (see e.g. Refs. 11Appel M. Hizlan D. Vinothkumar K.R.

In any case, conformational transitions are most probably involved in substrate transport of NhaA, although their exact nature has yet to be determined. The conformational transitions believed to be involved in NhaA pH regulation are distinct from the transport related ones. For example, it was suggested that at acidic pH an inactive acid-locked state exists where the periplasmic passage is blocked by an ion barrier (19Hunte C. Screpanti M. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 21Olkhova E. Hunte C. Screpanti E. Padan E. Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

J. 2007; 92: 3784-3791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). With increasing pH a signal from a putative “pH sensor” would remove the barrier and restore NhaA activity. A similar mechanism of pH regulation involves a disordered N terminus, and its pH-dependent ordering would restore activity at alkaline pH (11Appel M. Hizlan D. Vinothkumar K.R. Ziegler C. Kühlbrandt W. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These mechanisms have in common that they act in an allosteric manner and differ from the intrinsic pH dependence of the active site caused by the substrate proton. The above described mechanisms of substrate transport and pH regulation have been derived from extensive biochemical, biophysical computational and structural studies. Here we have undertaken another approach, solid supported membrane (SSM) 3The abbreviations used are: SSMsolid supported membraneISOinside outRSOright side out.-based electrophysiology (23Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which allows measurement of the NhaA activity under well defined conditions on both sides of the membrane. The aim of the study was to test whether and to what extent the pH dependence of NhaA is determined by allosteric pH regulation and/or by the intrinsic dependence of transport on the concentration of the substrate protons. Related to this issue is the question of whether the observed conformational transitions are regulative or part of the transport mechanism. solid supported membrane inside out right side out. C-terminal-His-tagged wt- and G338S-NhaA were overexpressed and purified on a Ni2+-NTA column as previously described (24Venturi M. Padan E. Hunte C. Von Jagow G. Schagger H. A Practical Guide to Membrane Protein Purification. Amsterdam, 2002: 179-190Google Scholar). Purified proteins in 25 mm potassium acetate (pH 5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.03% DDM were stored at 4 °C until reconstitution. Reconstitution of purified wild type or G338S mutant was carried out with Escherichia coli phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids). The lipid was evaporated under constant nitrogen flow and rotation. Then a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm DTT (pH 7) was added to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. The lipid suspension was extruded through a 400-nm filter. After extrusion, the liposomes had a mean diameter of 200–300 nm, measured by dynamic light scattering (Zeta Plus, Brookhaven Instrument Corp.). Subsequently, 1% (w/v) β-d-octylglucoside and purified wt- or G338S-NhaA in mass ratios of 1:10–1:50 to the lipid content were added. Removal of detergent was accomplished by adding 30% (v/v) polystyrene beads (Bio-Beads, Bio-Rad) followed by constant shaking at 4 °C overnight. After the polystyrene beads were exchanged for fresh ones, shaking was continued for 1 additional hour at 4 °C. After removal of the polystyrene beads, the proteoliposomes were centrifuged (130,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h) and resuspended in 300 mm KCl, 75 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT (pH 7) to a lipid concentration of 5 mg/ml. The proteoliposomes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Prior to the SSM measurements, the samples were gently sonicated with cooling breaks on ice until the suspensions became translucent. Production of inside out (ISO) membrane vesicles was performed by disruption of wt- or G338S-NhaA overexpressing E. coli with a French press (20,000 p.s.i.). Bacterial debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The ISO membrane vesicles were further purified by metal affinity two-phase partitioning according to Everberg et al. (25Everberg H. Clough J. Henderson P. Jergil B. Tjerneld F. Ramírez I.B. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1118: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Purification of ISO vesicles via a two-phase system in combination with Ni2+-NTA agarose resin was possible, as the His tag is cytoplasmatically located and, therefore, exposed in ISO vesicles. SSM measurements were performed as described previously (23Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly 45 μl of proteoliposomes at a lipid concentration of 5 mg/ml or ISO membrane vesicles at a total membrane protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml were adsorbed to an octadecanethiol/phospholipid hybrid bilayer on a gold surface (sensor). Proteoliposomes were allowed to adsorb to the sensor for 2–3 h. Adsorption of the ISO membrane vesicles was carried out for 3–12 h. By means of solution exchange protocols, electrogenic transport was initiated by a rapid change of substrate ion concentration. SSM measurements were performed according to a single solution exchange protocol (nonactivating solution, 0.5 s; activating solution, 0.5 s; nonactivating solution, 0.5 s) or a double solution exchange protocol (resting solution, 0.75 s; nonactivating solution, 0.8 s; activating solution, 0.5 s; nonactivating solution, 0.5 s; resting solution, 1 s). The double solution exchange protocol allowed separation of the pH artifact from the transporter-derived transient. Currents, recorded throughout the measurements, were amplified with a current amplifier set to a gain of 108-1010 V/A and low pass filtering set to 2000 Hz. To minimize Na+ concentration jump artifacts, sodium was replaced by an equal amount on an inert cation (K+ or choline) in the nonactivating solution. In addition, the ionic strength was kept high by adding choline+ or K+ to a total cation concentration of 305 mm. Details concerning the composition of the solutions are given in the figure legends. The current generated by the transporter is distorted by capacitive coupling via the network of the compound membrane formed by the SSM and the adsorbed liposomes (23Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In particular a characteristic time constant of the network τ is introduced into the signal, which was determined by an appropriate mono-exponential least-squares fit. Neglecting a constant scaling factor, the transporter current Irec can be reconstructed from the measured current I(t) using,Irec(t)=I(t)+1τ∫otI(t)dtEq. 1 For details see the supplemental Figs. 1–2. In general, three different data sets from three individual sensors were recorded for a substrate dependence. The peak currents of each Na+ dependence and Na+ gradient as well as pH gradient driven were normalized to the corresponding Vmax values resulting from a hyperbolic fit to the individual data sets and then averaged. Although data for a specific figure were obtained with a single proteoliposome or membrane preparation, various preparations were tested throughout this study, yielding essentially the same results. To describe the pH dependence of the transport activity after a Na+ concentration jump, peak currents Ipeak as well as the stationary component of reconstructed pump currents Irec were displayed. The currents (Ipeak or Irec) of each individual pH dependence at 10 and 100 mm Na+ (3–4 data sets) were first normalized to the scaling parameter A of the minimal-model turnover fit and then averaged. For presentation, the averaged currents were finally normalized to their maximal value at 100 mm Na+. For a detailed description of the minimal model, see the supplemental Fig. 3. Purified NhaA (5 μg) was resuspended in a 0.5-ml reaction mixture containing 0.1 m choline chloride, 0.7 mm EDTA/K+, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, 50 mm HEPES/Tris at the indicated pH values with or without the indicated concentration of NaCl. At zero time, 0.1 μg of trypsin (Sigma, type III from bovine pancreas) was added, the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, type II). The protein was precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C, centrifuged (21,000 × g for 30 min 4 °C), resuspended in sampling buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, and Coomassie Blue-stained, and the band density was quantified by Image Gauge (Fuji) software. Membrane vesicles prepared from bacteria overexpressing wild type (wt) or G338S NhaA and liposomes reconstituted with purified wt or G338S NhaA were analyzed using SSM-based electrophysiology. Membrane vesicles prepared by French press cell disruption have an ISO orientation (27Adler L.W. Ichikawa T. Hasan S.M. Tsuchiya T. Rosen B.P. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 7: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We have further ensured complete ISO orientation of the vesicles by using an extraction procedure with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-tagged beads (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown previously, in the proteoliposomes, NhaA is in a right-side out (RSO) orientation (28Zuber D. Krause R. Venturi M. Padan E. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1709: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two preparations enabled us to investigate the kinetics of the transporter in the forward and reverse modes (Fig. 1). Here the terms “forward” and “reverse” mode refer to the physiological transport direction of NhaA, where Na+ is transported from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic side of the protein, whereas H+ moves in the opposite direction or vice versa, respectively. Na+ gradient (ΔNa)-driven transport was investigated on the SSM by applying an inward-directed Na+ gradient (Na+ inside = 0) to the membrane vesicles or proteoliposomes. Therefore, ΔNa-driven transport corresponds to the forward mode in ISO membrane vesicles and to the reverse mode in RSO proteoliposomes. H+ gradient (ΔpH)-driven transport was studied only with RSO proteoliposomes using inside and outside-directed gradients, which again allowed the investigation of the forward and reverse transport modes. Membrane vesicles or proteoliposomes were adsorbed to the SSM, and transport was initiated by applying a pH or a Na+ concentration jump (Fig. 1). This generated a transient current in the capacitively coupled system (23Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In general, the observed transient currents represent the stationary transport activity of NhaA (28Zuber D. Krause R. Venturi M. Padan E. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1709: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the peak currents were taken to quantify the activity (23Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Only under extreme conditions were presteady-state current components observed in the signal (see Fig. 6). To account for this, the NhaA transporter current was numerically reconstructed using the properties of the capacitively coupled system (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the stationary component of the reconstructed transporter current was determined. In comparison it was found that reconstructed currents and peak currents yield essentially the same results (see Fig. 2). In the following we will use only the peak currents and consider them as a reliable measure of the transporter steady-state activity.FIGURE 2pH dependence of transient currents obtained with wt- and G338S-NhaA after a Na+ concentration jump using the single solution exchange protocol. A and B, typical transient currents were recorded after a 100 mm Na+ concentration jump using RSO proteoliposomes and ISO membrane vesicles. Signals of ISO membrane vesicles are a superposition of the NhaA transporter current (negative phase) and the solution exchange artifact (positive phase). Signals of RSO proteoliposomes are so large that the contribution of artifacts is negligible. C and D, normalized peak currents at the indicated pH values were subtracted by the Na+ jump artifact. E and F, shown are normalized reconstructed stationary currents at the indicated pH values. The graphs show average values from recordings using three individual sensors and the corresponding S.D. Currents are normalized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, C, and E, ISO membrane vesicles with G338S NhaA (red) or wt NhaA (black) are shown. B, D, and F, RSO proteoliposomes (LPR = 10) with G338S NhaA (red) or wt NhaA (black) are shown. For the Na+ concentration jumps, activating solutions containing 10 mm NaCl and 290 mm KCl or 100 mm NaCl and 200 mm KCl titrated to the indicated pH values with HCl or Tris were used. The nonactivating solutions contained 300 mm KCl instead. In addition all buffers contained 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris, 25 mm MOPS, 25 mm MES, and 1 mm DTT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To compare the transport properties of G338S NhaA and wt NhaA, the pH dependence of ΔNa-driven transport was investigated using SSM measurements. Therefore, concentration jumps of 10 and 100 mm Na+ were performed at pH values of pH 5 to 8 for G338S NhaA and at pH values of pH 6 to 9.5 for wt NhaA (Fig. 2). The pH dependence of transport was investigated in forward (Fig. 2, A, C, and E) and reverse transport direction (Fig. 2, B, D, and F) using ISO membrane vesicles and RSO proteoliposomes, respectively. Transient currents are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. In agreement with the 1Na+/2H+ stoichiometry of NhaA, ΔNa-driven transport results in a negative current (Fig. 2, A and B). Because the transporter currents of the ISO preparation are small, positive solution exchange artifacts superimpose the signal, resulting in biphasic current transients (Fig. 2A). The peak currents (Fig. 2, C and D) as well as the stationary component of reconstructed transporter currents (Fig. 2, E and F) are displayed. As is apparent in the figure, peak currents and reconstructed stationary currents are hardly different. wt NhaA, after a 100 mm Na+ jump at pH 8.5, yielded peak currents of −1.2 ± 0.3 nA for ISO membrane vesicles and −12 ± 2 nA for RSO proteoliposomes. G338S NhaA peak currents after a 100 mm Na+ jump at pH 7 were −1.6 ± 0.7 nA for RSO proteoliposomes and −1.2 ± 0.4 nA for ISO membrane vesicles. At pH 6, after a 100 mm Na+ jump, wt NhaA transient currents were of positive polarity with peak currents of 129 ± 63 pA for RSO proteoliposomes and 213 ± 120 pA for ISO membrane vesicles. The same was observed at pH 5 after a 100 mm Na+ jump using G338S NhaA with peak currents of 180 ± 20 pA for RSO proteoliposomes and 140 ± 40 pA for ISO membrane vesicles. The positive transient currents closely resembled the Na+ solution exchange artifact on empty sensors that are caused by ion binding/release to/from the SSM (29Garcia-Celma J.J. Hatahet L. Kunz W. Fendler K. Langmuir. 2007; 23: 10074-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In particular, time constants and peak values for a particular sensor were equal. Therefore, these currents were assigned to Na+ solution exchange artifacts, and their amplitudes (peak currents) were subtracted from the signal amplitudes. Comparison of the ΔNa-driven transport in forward (Fig. 2, C and E) and reverse direction (Fig. 2, D and F) showed that transport of wt NhaA and G338S NhaA is virtually transport direction-independent at all pH values. G338S NhaA showed a maximal transport activity between pH 7 and 7.5. In contrast, the pH dependence of wt NhaA showed a maximal transport activity between pH 8.5 and 9. At pH values higher and lower than optimal, the currents decreased with the same characteristics for wt NhaA and G338S NhaA. Note that the decrease of the transients at non-optimal pH values was fully reversible throughout the entire pH range shown in the figure. Hence, G338S NhaA is not independent of pH in the physiological pH range. It rather shows a pH dependence shifted by ∼1.8 pH units to more acidic pH values compared with the wt. The Na+ dependence of ΔNa-driven transport of wt NhaA in the forward direction was investigated at pH 8.5, where the transport activity is maximal, and at pH 7.5, where a reduced transport activity is observed (Fig. 3, A and B). In the reverse transport direction, the Na+ dependence was measured at pH 9 and 7.5 (Fig. 3, C and D). For a direct comparison, data for RSO proteoliposomes at pH 8.5, determined previously (28Zuber D. Krause R. Venturi M. Padan E. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1709: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), are included in Table 1.TABLE 1ΔNa-driven transport using ISO and RSO preparationsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The individual data sets obtained with different sensors were fitted with a hyperbolic model function with a half-saturation concentration Km and a saturation value of vmax. A direct comparison of vmax at pH 7.5 and 8.5 (ISO) or pH 7.5 and 9.0 was possible, because data for both pH values were determined with the same sensor. The comparison showed that vmax did not change significantly when the pH was reduced. In forward transport direction, vmax decreased by 30% on average when going from pH 8.5 to 7.5. In reverse transport direction, vmax decreased by 20% on average when going from pH 9 to 7.5. For a comparison of KmNa, averaged data of different sensors as shown in Fig. 3 were used. In contrast to vmax, KmNa varied significantly with pH (Table 1). As observed for the pH dependence (Fig. 2), the kinetic properties of NhaA in forward and reverse transport direction were similar. For comparison, the Na+ dependence of ΔNa-driven transport of G338S NhaA in forward and reverse directions was investigated at pH 7.0 and 6.0 (Fig. 4). A similar analysis as described above for wt NhaA led to the conclusion that also in this case vmax did not change significantly with pH, but KmNa does. Again the kinetic properties of NhaA in forward and reverse transport direction were similar (Table 1). To estimate a putative influence of Na+ contaminations introduced into the nominally Na+-free buffers by the KCl salt, the concentration of Na+ in the normally used nonactivating solution was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy to be 100 ± 40 μm. In addition, the concentration dependence was measured with choline chloride instead of KCl and with ultraclean KCl beads. In the latter case, the Na+ contamination was only 3 μm. With choline chloride and ultraclean KCl beads we obtained a KmNa = 7.8 ± 0.7 and 6 ± 1 mm, respectively. This is not significantly different from the previously determined value of KmNa = 11 ± 0.7 mm (28Zuber D. Krause R. Venturi M. Padan E. Bamberg E. Fendler K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1709: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, an influence of contaminating Na+ on the determined kinetic parameters could be ruled out. To investigate ΔpH-driven transport of NhaA, the dependence of the transient currents after a pH jump at different symmetrical Na+ concentrations was studied (Fig. 5) using wt NhaA, RSO proteoliposomes. A pH jump from high to low pH corresponds to transport in the forward direction (high pH inside, low pH outside the liposomes), and a pH jump from low to high pH reflects transport in the reverse direction. As a consequence, pH jumps from pH 8.5 to 7, 6, or 5 generated transient currents of positive sign. In contrast, pH jumps from pH 5, 6, or 7 to pH 8.5 resulted in negative currents. As a control, pH jumps in the absence of sodium were recorded. These pH artifact currents are most probably due to an interaction of protons with lipid headgroups (29Garcia-Celma J.J. Hatahet L. Kunz W. Fendler K. Langmuir. 2007; 23: 10074-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). They were small (approximately a factor of 10 smaller than at 50 mm Na+), and their peak currents were subtracted from the corresponding peak currents measured in the presence of Na+. For optimal timing of the experimental steps, the equilibration time needed to attain symmetrical Na+ concentrations after a Na+ concentration change was determined. First ΔpH-induced currents were measured in the presence of 1.25 mm Na+. After incubation at a Na+ concentration of 100 mm for 1 h, much larger ΔpH-induced currents were recorded. Subsequently, a Na+ concentration of 1.25 mm was reestablished. After an incubation time >6 min, the initial low current amplitude was obtained again. Therefore, after a change in Na+ concentration, the SSM was incubated for 6 min at the new concentration before the currents were recorded. Using different pH concentration jump protocols, positive (forward mode) and negative (reverse mode) currents could be generated. These currents were of a comparable magnitude as the ΔNa-driven currents at pH 8.5 (see Fig. 5 A for a comparison). Interestingly the ΔpH-driven currents persisted without a detectable d"

To satisfy the demand for ribosomes, cells have evolved mechanisms to ensure robust production of rRNAs. In eukaryotes, the specialized RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription machinery is dedicated to this process. In proliferating yeast cells, more than 60% of total transcription is due to Pol I activity (Warner, 1999Warner J.R. The economics of ribosome biosynthesis in yeast.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), whose only essential function is the synthesis of a large precursor comprising three out of four rRNAs (Nogi et al., 1991Nogi Y. Yano R. Nomura M. Synthesis of large rRNAs by RNA polymerase II in mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in RNA polymerase I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 3962-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Efficient template usage by Pol I is supported by gene multiplication, resulting in large tandem arrays of rRNA genes that may be scattered throughout the genome depending on the respective organism (Raska et al., 2004Raska I. Koberna K. Malínský J. Fidlerová H. Masata M. The nucleolus and transcription of ribosomal genes.Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, only a fraction of the rRNA gene population is transcriptionally active even in exponentially growing cells. The underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. In good correlation with their transcriptional activity, rRNA genes adopt two discrete chromatin states. Besides initial evidence by electron microscopy and biochemical fractionation (Miller and Beatty, 1969Miller Jr., O.L. Beatty B.R. Visualization of nucleolar genes.Science. 1969; 164: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, Davis et al., 1983Davis A.H. Reudelhuber T.L. Garrard W.T. Varigated chromatin structures of mouse ribosomal RNA genes.J. Mol.

Two different chromatin structures coexist in ribosomal RNA genes throughout the cell cycle.Cell. 1989; 57: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the two rDNA chromatin states are distinguished due to their different accessibility to the DNA intercalating drug psoralen. Additional analyses supported a model in which psoralen-accessible (open) rRNA genes are actively transcribed and nucleosome free, whereas psoralen-inaccessible (closed) rRNA genes are nontranscribed and nucleosomal (Dammann et al., 1993Dammann R.

Importantly, both forms coexist throughout the cell cycle (Conconi et al., 1989Conconi A. Widmer R.M. Koller T. Sogo J.M.

Since then, the absence or presence of nucleosomes on transcribed rRNA genes has been a matter of debate (reviewed in Birch and Zomerdijk, 2008Birch J.L. Zomerdijk J.C.B.M.

Chromatin organization of active ribosomal RNA genes.Epigenetics. 2008; 3: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A recent study in yeast demonstrated that the HMG box protein Hmo1 is part of a special chromatin state characteristic of transcribed rRNA genes, which is largely devoid of histone molecules (Merz et al., 2008Merz K. Hondele M. Goetze H. Gmelch K. Stoeckl U. Griesenbeck J. Actively transcribed rRNA genes in S. cerevisiae are organized in a specialized chromatin associated with the high-mobility group protein Hmo1 and are largely devoid of histone molecules.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1190-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Until recently, it has been unclear why eukaryotic cells maintain a fraction of their rRNA genes in the transcriptionally inactive, closed chromatin state. An analysis by Kobayashi and coworkers revealed that yeast strains carrying a reduced copy number of rRNA genes that are all actively transcribed become sensitive to DNA damage induced by mutagens (Ide et al., 2010Ide S. Miyazaki T. Maki H. Kobayashi T. Abundance of ribosomal RNA gene copies maintains genome integrity.Science. 2010; 327: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, the fraction of nontranscribed rRNA genes appears to be important for the integrity of the ribosomal DNA locus (rDNA). Maintenance of the two different chromatin states by inheritance of covalent histone modifications or DNA methylation pattern in metazoan cells has been suggested (reviewed in McStay and Grummt, 2008McStay B. Grummt I. The epigenetics of rRNA genes: from molecular to chromosome biology.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In yeast, however, individual rRNA genes may change their transcriptional state stochastically such that, each new generation, the set of rRNA genes may be different from the set that was active the previous generation (Dammann et al., 1995Dammann R. Lucchini R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Transcription in the yeast rRNA gene locus: distribution of the active gene copies and chromatin structure of their flanking regulatory sequences.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5294-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in experiments showing that the passage of the replication fork leads to nucleosome assembly at rRNA genes on both daughter strands, no strict correlation between the chromatin state of individual rRNA genes before and after replication could be observed (Lucchini and Sogo, 1995Lucchini R. Sogo J.M. Replication of transcriptionally active chromatin.Nature. 1995; 374: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). More recent data based on transcript counting in single yeast cells and mathematical modeling indicated that the set of transcriptionally active rRNA genes changes independent of replication (Tan and van Oudenaarden, 2010Tan R.Z. van Oudenaarden A. Transcript counting in single cells reveals dynamics of rDNA transcription.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the average ratio between the two chromatin states at yeast rRNA genes is faithfully transmitted to daughter cells during growth in exponential phase. Here, we investigated chromatin dynamics at yeast rRNA genes during the cell cycle and upon cell-cycle arrest. We found that replication is required to convert rRNA genes into the closed chromatin state. Thus, almost the entirety of rRNA genes adopts the open chromatin state when replication is prevented. This conversion to the open rRNA gene chromatin state is impaired in the absence of Pol I transcription. Although Pol I transcription is required to establish the open rRNA gene chromatin state, it is not needed for its maintenance outside of S phase. Instead, we identified the HMG box protein Hmo1 as a factor stabilizing open rRNA gene chromatin in the absence of Pol I transcription, presumably interfering with replication-independent nucleosome assembly. In S. cerevisiae (hereafter called yeast), the rDNA locus consists of around 150 tandemly repeated transcription units on the right arm of chromosome XII (Figure 1A ). Each of these rDNA units comprises the RNA polymerase III transcribed 5S rRNA gene, the intergenic spacer region (IGS), and the 35S rRNA gene transcribed by Pol I, yielding the precursor of the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. We performed psoralen crosslinking analyses with yeast cells before, during, and after release from G1 arrest (see histograms in Figure 1B for flow cytometric analysis). After psoralen treatment, isolated DNA fragments originating from open or closed 35S rRNA genes migrate with different mobility in native agarose gel electrophoresis (Conconi et al., 1989Conconi A. Widmer R.M. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Two different chromatin structures coexist in ribosomal RNA genes throughout the cell cycle.Cell. 1989; 57: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, Dammann et al., 1993Dammann R. Lucchini R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Chromatin structures and transcription of rDNA in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis revealed that the open/closed ratio of two different EcoRI fragments spanning the region coding for 18S rRNA and for 25S rRNA, respectively, varied during the cell cycle (Figure 1C, top; see Figures 1D and 1E for quantitation). In contrast, psoralen accessibility of an EcoRI rDNA fragment containing the IGS, migrating as one single band in the gel in all samples taken in course of the experiment, did not change (Figure 1C, bottom). The fraction of open 35S rRNA genes decreased whenever cells entered S phase (Figure 1C, top, lanes 6–8 and 12–14; see Figure 1E for quantitation). This is consistent with earlier reports indicating that all newly replicated 35S rRNA genes are assembled into an array of nucleosomes and become psoralen inaccessible (Lucchini and Sogo, 1995Lucchini R. Sogo J.M. Replication of transcriptionally active chromatin.Nature. 1995; 374: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A constant increase in the open/closed ratio of 35S rRNA genes was observed at all stages of the cell cycle following DNA replication or during the cell-cycle arrest (Figure 1C, top, lanes 2–4 and 9–11; see Figure 1E for quantitation). To test replication-dependent nucleosome assembly by another approach, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments with extracts from cells expressing histone H4 as a fusion protein with C-terminal HA-epitope from its endogenous chromosomal location (Figure S1A available online). We also included the corresponding wild-type strain as an untagged control (Figure S1B). We observed a slight but reproducible increase in the coprecipitation of various DNA fragments encompassing regions of the 35S rRNA-coding sequence with the tagged histone during S phase, whereas three different reference loci inside and outside of the rDNA did not show this tendency (Figure S1A). The increased coprecipitation of 35S rRNA gene DNA fragments with histone H4 during S phase (by a factor of 1.3 in average) was in good correlation with the increase in the fraction of closed 35S rRNA genes observed in the psoralen crosslinking analysis in this condition (by a factor of 1.28 in average). We observed similar alterations of 35S rRNA gene chromatin structure in cells after release from late anaphase arrest or G2/M arrest (Figures S1C and S1D). Moreover, a strain carrying a reduced rDNA repeat copy number with most of the 35S rRNA genes in the open chromatin state and actively transcribed (Cioci et al., 2003Cioci F. Vu L. Eliason K. Oakes M. Siddiqi I.N. Nomura M. Silencing in yeast rDNA chromatin: reciprocal relationship in gene expression between RNA polymerase I and II.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 135-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) also showed a substantial fraction of closed 35S rRNA genes during S phase (Figure S1E). These results indicate that DNA replication is required to establish the closed chromatin state at 35S rRNA genes in proliferating yeast cells. We next investigated to what extent the fraction of open 35S rRNA genes can be increased when entry into S phase and thus initiation of DNA replication is blocked. Cells were arrested in G1, G1/S, and late anaphase (see histograms in Figures 2A–2C for flow cytometric analysis). In all cases, we observed a strong increase in the fraction of open 35S rRNA genes (Figures 2A–2C, top, see graphs for quantitation), whereas psoralen accessibility of an IGS fragment remained unaltered (Figures 2A–2C, bottom). Thus, almost the entire 35S rRNA gene population can adopt the open chromatin state in the absence of DNA replication. The psoralen-accessible state of 35S rRNA genes has been linked to Pol I transcription, the presence of the HMG box protein Hmo1, and the absence of histone molecules (Merz et al., 2008Merz K. Hondele M. Goetze H. Gmelch K. Stoeckl U. Griesenbeck J. Actively transcribed rRNA genes in S. cerevisiae are organized in a specialized chromatin associated with the high-mobility group protein Hmo1 and are largely devoid of histone molecules.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1190-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To define the rDNA chromatin states on a molecular level before and at different times during G1 arrest, we analyzed the protein composition at open and closed rRNA genes. We used a combination of chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC) and psoralen crosslinking (Merz et al., 2008Merz K. Hondele M. Goetze H. Gmelch K. Stoeckl U. Griesenbeck J. Actively transcribed rRNA genes in S. cerevisiae are organized in a specialized chromatin associated with the high-mobility group protein Hmo1 and are largely devoid of histone molecules.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1190-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We created yeast strains expressing either histone proteins H2A or H3, Pol I subunits A190 or A43, or Hmo1 in fusion with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) from their endogenous chromosomal location. Cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde before and after 2 and 4 hr of G1 arrest. After nuclei preparation, calcium was added to induce cleavage by the MNase fusion proteins in the proximity of their respective DNA-binding sites. The samples were treated with psoralen, and the DNA was isolated and analyzed in a Southern blot. If a MNase fusion protein is a specific component of open or closed 35S rRNA genes in the cell, the corresponding psoralen crosslinked DNA-fragment will be selectively degraded as a consequence of ChEC (Merz et al., 2008Merz K. Hondele M. Goetze H. Gmelch K. Stoeckl U. Griesenbeck J. Actively transcribed rRNA genes in S. cerevisiae are organized in a specialized chromatin associated with the high-mobility group protein Hmo1 and are largely devoid of histone molecules.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1190-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We confirmed that open 35S rRNA genes were virtually free of histone molecules and thus resistant to MNase cleavage before and at all time points of the arrest, whereas closed 35S rRNA genes were nucleosomal and thus fully degraded by histone-MNase fusion proteins (Figure 3A and 3B , see graphs for quantitation). In contrast, Pol I-, and Hmo1-MNase fusion proteins degraded selectively the open 35S rRNA genes (Figures 3C–3E, see graphs for quantitation). We noticed that the degradation of open 35S rRNA genes mediated by different Pol I-MNase fusion proteins became significantly slower with prolonged G1 arrest (Figures 3C and 3D, compare panels asyn, 2h G1, and 4h G1). This suggests a decreased density of Pol I-MNase fusion proteins on open 35S rRNA genes during prolonged G1 arrest. Alternatively, only a subpopulation of rRNA genes could be actively transcribed under these conditions. Importantly, the reduced Pol I association with the rRNA genes does not affect the maintenance of the open chromatin state. Different from Pol I-MNase fusion proteins, Hmo1-MNase-mediated degradation of open 35S rRNA genes followed the same kinetics in nuclei from asynchronously growing cells and cells after 2 hr and 4 hr arrest in G1 (Figure 3E). These analyses corroborate our previous observation that Hmo1 is a component of the open 35S rRNA gene chromatin state being largely depleted of histone molecules (Merz et al., 2008Merz K. Hondele M. Goetze H. Gmelch K. Stoeckl U. Griesenbeck J. Actively transcribed rRNA genes in S. cerevisiae are organized in a specialized chromatin associated with the high-mobility group protein Hmo1 and are largely devoid of histone molecules.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1190-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It further points to the possibility that reduced Pol I association with rRNA genes does not affect the stability of the open chromatin state. These results were verified in an independent experiment. We performed ChIP with extracts from cells expressing the histone H3, the Pol I subunit A190, or Hmo1 as fusion proteins with a C-terminal HA-epitope from their endogenous chromosomal location. We also included the corresponding wild-type strain as an untagged control. We analyzed coprecipitation of DNA fragments from the Pol I promoter (Figure 4A , Prom), three different regions within the 35S rRNA gene-coding sequence (Figure 4A, 18S, 25S_1, 25S_2), the 5S rRNA gene (Figure 4A, 5S), and two unrelated genomic loci within an intergenic region close to the 3′ end of the NUP57 gene and within the open reading frame of the NOC1 gene. None of these DNA fragments was significantly enriched when ChIP experiments were performed in the untagged strain (Figure 4B, graph “untagged”). In good correlation with the increase in the number of open rRNA genes and the result of the above ChEC experiments (Figures 3A and 3B), we observed a decrease in coprecipitation of 35S rRNA gene fragments with the tagged histone molecule in course of the G1 arrest (Figure 4B, graph H3). Notably, DNA fragments including the 5S rRNA gene or the NOC1-coding sequence were also less efficiently enriched during prolonged G1 arrest, although the observed decrease in coprecipitation with the tagged histone molecule was substantially smaller than the decrease in coprecipitation of 35S rRNA gene fragments. Interestingly, the 5S rRNA gene and NOC1 fragments include genomic regions, which are potentially transcribed under these experimental conditions. Coprecipitation of the intergenic fragment close to the 3′ end of NUP57 with the tagged histone H3 instead got slightly more efficient in course of the arrest. Again, in good correlation with the increase in the number of open rRNA genes and the results of the ChEC analyses, we found a strong increase in the coprecipitation of 35S rRNA gene fragments with the tagged Hmo1 molecule in the course of the G1 arrest (Figure 4B, graph Hmo1). A slight increase in coprecipitation of the DNA fragment including the 5S rRNA gene was also observed, correlating with the slightly decreased coprecipitation of this fragment with the tagged histone H3 (Figure 4B, graph H3). DNA fragments spanning the other genomic loci investigated were not considerably enriched upon precipitation of the tagged Hmo1 protein. Thus, these results are in full agreement with an anticorrelation of the association of histones and Hmo1 molecules with 35S rRNA genes (Merz et al., 2008Merz K. Hondele M. Goetze H. Gmelch K. Stoeckl U. Griesenbeck J. Actively transcribed rRNA genes in S. cerevisiae are organized in a specialized chromatin associated with the high-mobility group protein Hmo1 and are largely devoid of histone molecules.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1190-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast to results obtained with tagged Hmo1, coprecipitation of 35S rRNA gene fragments with the tagged Pol I subunit A190 rather decreased in the course of the G1 arrest (Figure 4B, graph A190), although the number of open 35S rRNA genes increased in these conditions (Figure 2A). This is consistent with the results of the ChEC experiments with Pol I-MNase fusion proteins during prolonged G1 arrest (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, an increase in the number of open 35S rRNA genes does not necessarily involve an increased association of Pol I with these genomic loci. Taken together, opening of rRNA genes in the absence of replication correlates with the depletion of histones (Figures 3A and 3B and Figure 4B) and with the recruitment of Hmo1 (Figure 3E and Figure 4B). Nevertheless, a high Pol I occupancy does not seem to be required to maintain the open chromatin state (Figures 3C and 3D and Figure 4B). We next investigated the contribution of Pol I transcription to the establishment of open rRNA gene chromatin. We performed psoralen crosslinking in a strain carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the RRN3 gene (rrn3-ts), encoding a factor that is essential for Pol I transcription initiation (Yamamoto et al., 1996Yamamoto R.T. Nogi Y. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. RRN3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an essential RNA polymerase I transcription factor which interacts with the polymerase independently of DNA template.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this strain, the ratio between open and closed 35S rRNA genes remained constant when the cells were cultured in the exponential phase at the permissive temperature (Figure 5A , lanes 1–6). Instead, we observed conversion from the open to the closed 35S rRNA gene chromatin state when the rrn3-ts mutant was cultured at the restrictive temperature for more than 1 hr (Figure 5A, lanes 7–12). Accordingly, we observed a slight increase in the coprecipitation of DNA fragments spanning regions of the 35S rRNA gene with tagged histone molecules in ChIP experiments after shutdown of Pol I transcription (Figure S2A ). However, we noticed that there was still a detectable fraction of open 35S rRNA genes even 5 hr after the inactivation of Pol I transcription (Figure 5A, see profile analysis on the right). Along these lines, we still found Hmo1 bound to rRNA genes, although its association with these loci is substantially reduced in these conditions (data not shown). This suggests that not all of the 35S rRNA genes have undergone replication-dependent nucleosome assembly after complete shutdown of Pol I transcription. In support of this notion, cell division ceased 2 hr after temperature shift of the rrn3-ts mutant (Figure S2B). We conclude that Pol I transcription is important for maintenance of the ratio between open and closed 35S rRNA genes in proliferating cells, presumably because it is required for re-establishment of the open chromatin state after replication.Figure S2Inhibition of Pol I Transcription, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Inhibition of Pol I transcription leads to nucleosome assembly at rRNA genes in replicating cells.

Samples were taken before (0h) or at the indicated times after temperature shift. Cell number was determined and plotted against hours after temperature shift. To test more directly the involvement of Pol I transcription in the opening of 35S rRNA gene chromatin, we performed a similar analysis in the absence of replication. The rrn3-ts strain was arrested in G1 and simultaneously shifted to the restrictive temperature or kept at the permissive temperature as a control. G1 arrest of the strain grown at the restrictive and at the permissive temperatures was monitored by flow cytometry (Figure 5B, histograms). Whereas most of the 35S rRNA gene population opened during the arrest under permissive conditions (Figure 5B, lanes 1–6, see profile analysis for quantitation), the ratio of open and closed 35S rRNA genes first increased and then remained constant 2 hr after shutdown of Pol I transcription initiation (Figure 5B, lanes 7–12, see profile analysis for quantitation). To exclude that the temperature shift interfered with opening of rRNA genes, a corresponding RRN3 wild-type strain was treated identically. In this strain, almost the entire 35S rRNA gene population became psoralen accessible after 5 hr of G1 arrest at 37°C (Figure 5B, lanes 13–18, see profile analysis for quantitation). Altogether, these data indicate that Pol I transcription is required to convert 35S rRNA genes from the closed to the open chromatin state. Interestingly, open 35S rRNA genes can be stably maintained when both rDNA transcription and replication (entry into S phase) are blocked (Figure 5B, lanes 7–12, see profile analysis for quantitation). To further explore the molecular basis of maintenance of the open rRNA gene chromatin in the absence of Pol I transcription and replication, we performed ChEC in combination with psoralen crosslinking using rrn3-ts strains expressing A190- or Hmo1-MNase fusion proteins. Degradation of open rRNA genes by A190-MNase was negligible after 1 hr of temperature shift and G1 arrest and undetectable after 5 hr (Figure 5C, lanes 9–12 and 17–20, see graphs for quantitation). In contrast, Hmo1-MNase efficiently degraded open rRNA gene chromatin, eve"
https://openalex.org/W2095345152,"Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs, FGF11-14) bind to the C termini (CTs) of specific voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC) and thereby regulate their function. The effect of an individual FHF on a specific VGSC varies greatly depending upon the individual FHF isoform. How individual FHFs impart distinctive effects on specific VGSCs is not known and the specificity of these pairwise interactions is not understood. Using several biochemical approaches combined with functional analysis, we mapped the interaction site for FGF12B on the Na(V)1.5 C terminus and discovered previously unknown determinants necessary for FGF12 interaction. Also, we demonstrated that FGF12B binds to some, but not all Na(V)1 CTs, suggesting specificity of interaction. Exploiting a human single nucleotide polymorphism in the core domain of FGF12 (P149Q), we identified a surface proline that contributes a part of this pairwise specificity. This proline is conserved among all FHFs, and mutation of the homologous residue in FGF13 also leads to loss of interaction with a specific VGSC CT (Na(V)1.1) and loss of modulation of the resultant Na(+) channel function. We hypothesized that some of the specificity mediated by this proline may result from differences in the affinity of the binding partners. Consistent with this hypothesis, surface plasmon resonance data showed that the P149Q mutation decreased the binding affinity between FHFs and VGSC CTs. Moreover, immunocytochemistry revealed that the mutation prevented proper subcellular targeting of FGF12 to the axon initial segment in neurons. Together, these results give new insights into details of the interactions between FHFs and Na(V)1.x CTs, and the consequent regulation of Na(+) channels."

Here, we describe a novel role for the enzyme in the regulation of TGFβ1 signaling in dermal fibroblasts both in vivo and in vitro. Adamts5(-/-) mice, generated by deletion of exon 2, exhibit impaired contraction and dermal collagen deposition in an excisional wound healing model. This was accompanied by accumulation in the dermal layer of cell aggregates and fibroblastic cells surrounded by a pericellular matrix enriched in full-length aggrecan. Adamts5(-/-) wounds exhibit low expression (relative to wild type) of collagen type I and type III but show a persistently elevated expression of tgfbRII and alk1. Aggrecan deposition and impaired dermal repair in Adamts5(-/-) mice are both dependent on CD44, and Cd44(-/-)/Adamts5(-/-) mice display robust activation of TGFβ receptor II and collagen type III expression and the dermal regeneration seen in WT mice. TGFβ1 treatment of newborn fibroblasts from wild type mice results in Smad2/3 phosphorylation, whereas cells from Adamts5(-/-) mice phosphorylate Smad1/5/8. The altered TGFβ1 response in the Adamts5(-/-) cells is dependent on the presence of aggrecan and expression of CD44, because Cd44(-/-)/Adamts5(-/-) cells respond like WT cells. We propose that ADAMTS5 deficiency in fibrous tissues results in a poor repair response due to the accumulation of aggrecan in the pericellular matrix of fibroblast progenitor cells, which prevents their transition to mature fibroblasts. Thus, the capacity of ADAMTS5 to modulate critical tissue repair signaling events suggests a unique role for this enzyme, which sets it apart from other members of the ADAMTS family of proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1994560730,"Although amyloid fibrils deposit with various proteins, the comprehensive mechanism by which they form remains unclear. We studied the formation of fibrils of human islet amyloid polypeptide associated with type II diabetes in the presence of various concentrations of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) under acidic and neutral pH conditions using CD, amyloid-specific thioflavin T fluorescence, fluorescence imaging with thioflavin T, and atomic force microscopy. At low pH, the formation of fibrils was promoted by HFIP with an optimum at 5% (v/v). At neutral pH in the absence of HFIP, significant amounts of amorphous aggregates formed in addition to the fibrils. The addition of HFIP suppressed the formation of amorphous aggregates, leading to a predominance of fibrils with an optimum effect at 25% (v/v). Under both conditions, higher concentrations of HFIP dissolved the fibrils and stabilized the α-helical structure. The results indicate that fibrils and amorphous aggregates are different types of precipitates formed by exclusion from water-HFIP mixtures. The exclusion occurs through the combined effects of hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions, both of which are strengthened by low concentrations of HFIP, and a subtle balance between the two types of interactions determines whether the fibrils or amorphous aggregates dominate.

IntroductionAmyloid fibrils play an important role in a range of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, dialysis-related amyloidosis, and type II diabetes mellitus (1Sipe J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab.

In addition, various proteins and peptides not related to amyloidosis form similar fibrillar deposits in vitro (5Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5041) Google Scholar). In several cases, the fibrillar deposits are functional (6Fowler D.M. Koulov A.V. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. Trends Biochem.

Although the biological impact of amyloid fibrils is tremendous, we still do not have a general view of why and how the fibrils form. On the other hand, we have increasing evidence suggesting the underlying mechanism of fibril formation. 1) First, fibril formation is coupled with the denaturation of proteins (8Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 9Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Talapatra A. Minert L.J. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Millett I. Fink A.L.

Because the cross-β structure with a hydrogen bond network is essential for the fibrils (11Nelson R. Eisenberg D. Adv.

Interestingly, amyloidogenicity is enhanced only at moderate concentrations of alcohols.

As far as we know, no case was reported where an entire region of a molecule of more than 20,000 formed fibrils (16Fändrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M.

For an example, medin, a 50-residue-long peptide produced from lactadherin, a 364-residue glycoprotein, is a main component of aortic medical amyloid (19Häggqvist B. Näslund J. Sletten K.

It is worth noting that various peptide hormones easily form fibrils. Short amyloidogenic peptides form microcrystals useful for obtaining structural insights into amyloid fibrils (11Nelson R.

Taking these findings together, one should consider the formation of amyloid fibrils with respect to the solubility of proteins and peptides in a denatured state. Vendruscolo and co-workers (22Tartaglia G.G. Pechmann S. Dobson C.M. Vendruscolo M. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Pechmann S. Vendruscolo M. Mol. Biosyst. 2010; 6: 2490-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) studied this issue by simulating the competition between folding and aggregation and the solubility of proteins. At the same time, one should consider the difference between amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates. To address these issues, it would be useful to examine the effects of alcohols.The effects of alcohols on proteins and peptides have been investigated extensively, including the destruction of the native conformation, the induction of α-helices, and the dissolution of peptide aggregates (24Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). These effects can be explained by the polarity of the solvent (24Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In solvents of low polarity, the hydrophobic interactions stabilizing the native structure or peptide aggregates are weakened, and simultaneously local hydrogen bonds are strengthened, resulting in denaturation and the stabilization of extended α-helical structures. Among various alcohols, TFE and HFIP are often used because of their marked potential (25Hirota N. Mizuno K. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This efficiency is linked with the propensity of these alcohols to form dynamic clusters via hydrophobic interactions (26Hong D.P. Hoshino M. Kuboi R. Goto Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 8427-8433Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The effects of detergents such as SDS can be interpreted in a similar way, in which the formation of micelles is important to understand their effects (13Yamaguchi K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).To examine the effects of alcohols on amyloidogenic proteins in detail, we used human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP, also known as amylin) with a high propensity to form amorphous aggregates as well as amyloid fibrils. hIAPP is a 37-residue peptide hormone with an amidated C terminus and an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys-2 and Cys-7 (supplemental Fig. S1A). Amyloid fibrils of hIAPP deposit near pancreatic β-cells of type II diabetes, with their presence strongly correlating with a loss of β-cell mass and decreased pancreatic function (27Clark A.

In the absence of HFIP at neutral pH, hIAPP tended to form amorphous aggregates, suggesting that HFIP destabilizes a pathway leading to these aggregates and instead stabilizes the pathway to the fibrils. Here, we propose that the amyloid fibril is a unique conformation of proteins of relatively short length and peptides when they are excluded from water.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, the formation of fibrils by hIAPP in the presence of various concentrations of HFIP suggests that amyloid fibrils are one type of protein precipitate formed upon exclusion from an aqueous environment. Amyloid fibrils are distinct from amorphous aggregates in terms of the organized formation of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, which is promoted in the presence of moderate concentrations of HFIP. The effects of moderate concentrations of HFIP or SDS may mimic the membrane environment, accelerating the formation of fibrils. We also suggest that the length of the polypeptide chain is critical in determining the morphology of the precipitates of polypeptides, from single crystals to amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates. IntroductionAmyloid fibrils play an important role in a range of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, dialysis-related amyloidosis, and type II diabetes mellitus (1Sipe J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab.

In addition, various proteins and peptides not related to amyloidosis form similar fibrillar deposits in vitro (5Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5041) Google Scholar). In several cases, the fibrillar deposits are functional (6Fowler D.M. Koulov A.V. Balch W.E. Kelly J.W. Trends Biochem.

Although the biological impact of amyloid fibrils is tremendous, we still do not have a general view of why and how the fibrils form. On the other hand, we have increasing evidence suggesting the underlying mechanism of fibril formation. 1) First, fibril formation is coupled with the denaturation of proteins (8Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 9Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Talapatra A. Minert L.J. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Millett I. Fink A.L.

Biol. 2011; 407: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that it is a property of unfolded or non-native proteins. 2) Hydrophobicity is a dominant factor determining the amyloidogenicity of proteins. Because the cross-β structure with a hydrogen bond network is essential for the fibrils (11Nelson R. Eisenberg D. Adv. Protein Chem. 2006; 73: 235-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the propensity of side chains as well as the main chains to form hydrogen bonds is also important. 3) Alcohols, particularly 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) 3The abbreviations used are: TFE2,2,2-trifluoroethanolHFIP1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanolCMCcritical micelle concentrationhIAPPhuman islet amyloid polypeptideThTthioflavin TAFMatomic force microscopyTEMtransmission electron microscopyTIRFMtotal internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2059015361,"Deregulated IL-12 and IL-23 production from activated myeloid lineage cells is a key driver of numerous T cell-dependent autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. IL-12 and IL-23 share a common p40 subunit encoded by Il12b, which is negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by the STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)-activating anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. We found that IL-10 targets an enhancer 10 kb upstream of the Il12b transcriptional start site. Within the enhancer, a single 10-bp site is required for the inhibitory effects of IL-10 and is bound by NFIL3 (nuclear factor, interleukin 3-regulated), a B-ZIP transcription factor. Myeloid cells lacking NFIL3 produce excessive IL-12p40 and increased IL-12p70. Thus, the STAT3-dependent expression of NFIL3 is a key component of a negative feedback pathway in myeloid cells that suppresses proinflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2001008864,"Uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are thought to be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Previously, we have shown that in RPE monolayers, oxidative-stress reduced complement inhibition on the cell surface. The resulting increased level of sublytic complement activation resulted in VEGF release, which disrupted the barrier facility of these cells as determined by transepithelial resistance (TER) measurements. Induced rather than basal VEGF release in RPE is thought to be controlled by different mechanisms, including voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) activation and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Here we examined the potential intracellular links between sublytic complement activation and VEGF release in RPE cells challenged with H(2)O(2) and complement-sufficient normal human serum (NHS). Disruption of barrier function by H(2)O(2) + NHS rapidly increased Ras expression and Erk and Src phosphorylation, but had no effect on P38 phosphorylation. Either treatment alone had little effect. TER reduction could be attenuated by inhibiting Ras, Erk and Src activation, or blocking VDCC or VEGF-R2 activation, but not by inhibiting P38. Combinatorial analysis of inhibitor effects demonstrated that sublytic complement activation triggers VEGF secretion via two pathways, Src and Ras-Erk, with the latter being amplified by VEGF-R2 activation, but has no effect on constitutive VEGF secretion mediated via P38. Finally, effects on TER were directly correlated with release of VEGF; and sublytic MAC activation decreased levels of zfp36, a negative modulator of VEGF transcription, resulting in increased VEGF expression.

IRP1 is a bifunctional protein that mostly exists in a non-IRE-binding, [4Fe-4S] cluster aconitase form, whereas IRP2, which does not assemble an Fe-S cluster, spontaneously binds IREs. Although both IRPs fulfill a trans-regulatory function, only mice lacking IRP2 misregulate iron metabolism. NO stimulates the IRE-binding activity of IRP1 by targeting its Fe-S cluster. IRP2 has also been reported to sense NO, but the intrinsic function of IRP1 and IRP2 in NO-mediated regulation of cellular iron metabolism is controversial. In this study, we exposed bone marrow macrophages from Irp1(-/-) and Irp2(-/-) mice to NO and showed that the generated apo-IRP1 was entirely responsible for the posttranscriptional regulation of transferrin receptor 1, H-Ft, L-Ft, and ferroportin. The powerful action of NO on IRP1 also remedies the defects of iron storage found in IRP2-null bone marrow macrophages by efficiently reducing Ft overexpression. We also found that NO-dependent IRP1 activation, resulting in increased iron uptake and reduced iron sequestration and export, maintains enough intracellular iron to fuel the Fe-S cluster biosynthetic pathway for efficient restoration of the citric acid cycle aconitase in mitochondria. Thus, IRP1 is the dominant sensor and transducer of NO for posttranscriptional regulation of iron metabolism and participates in Fe-S cluster repair after exposure to NO."
https://openalex.org/W2050479583,"Gram-negative bacterial pathogens have developed specialized secretion systems to transfer bacterial proteins directly into host cells. These bacterial effectors are central to virulence and reprogram host cell processes to favor bacterial survival, colonization, and proliferation. Knowing the complete set of effectors encoded by a particular pathogen is the key to understanding bacterial disease. In addition, the identification of the molecular assemblies that these effectors engage once inside the host cell is critical to determining the mechanism of action of each effector. In this work we used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), a powerful quantitative proteomics technique, to identify the proteins secreted by the Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 type three secretion system (SPI-2 T3SS) and to characterize the host interaction partners of SPI-2 effectors. We confirmed many of the known SPI-2 effectors and were able to identify several novel substrate candidates of this secretion system. We verified previously published host protein-effector binding pairs and obtained 11 novel interactions, three of which were investigated further and confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. The host cell interaction partners identified here suggest that Salmonella SPI-2 effectors target, in a concerted fashion, cellular processes such as cell attachment and cell cycle control that are underappreciated in the context of infection.

Bacterial pathogens have evolved specialized secretion systems to transfer bacterial virulence proteins, also called effectors, from the bacterium to the host cell cytoplasm. The type three secretion system (T3SS) 9The abbreviations used are: T3SStype three secretion systemSPISalmonella pathogenicity islandSCVSalmonella-containing vacuoleSILACstable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell cultureLTQlinear trap quadrupoleOSBPoxysterol-binding protein 1NLRnucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containingPKN1protein kinase N1LPMlow phosphate, low magnesium. is a large macromolecular machine consisting of three transmembrane complexes: an inner membrane ring, an outer membrane ring, and a translocon pore that forms within the host cell membrane. Effectors are transferred from bacteria to the host cell through a needle-shaped structure that connects the outer membrane ring and the translocon (1Galán J.E. Wolf-Watz H. Nature. 2006; 444: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Effectors translocated by the T3SS are central to pathogenesis, as mutations that prevent proper assembly of the secretion machinery result in significant virulence defects and often completely hinder bacterial colonization of the host. Consequently, technology to identify and characterize effectors is the key to our understanding of bacterial disease. type three secretion system Salmonella pathogenicity island Salmonella-containing vacuole stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture linear trap quadrupole oxysterol-binding protein 1 nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein kinase N1 low phosphate, low magnesium. Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (S. typhimurium) is an intracellular pathogen that causes gastroenteritis in humans and a systemic infection resembling typhoid fever in mice (2Valdez Y. Ferreira R.B. Finlay B.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2009; 337: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). S. typhimurium virulence depends on two T3SSs that are encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and -2) (2Valdez Y. Ferreira R.B. Finlay B.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2009; 337: 93-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Marcus S.L. Brumell J.H. Pfeifer C.G. Finlay B.B. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The SPI-1 T3SS is key during the early stages of infection and effectors translocated by this secretion system mediate entry of S. typhimurium into nonphagocytic cells (4Galán J.E. Curtiss 3rd, R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 6383-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 5Menendez A. Arena E.T. Guttman J.A. Thorson L. Vallance B.A. Vogl W. Finlay B.B. J. Infect. Dis. 2009; 200: 1703-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This is accomplished by commandeering the ability of the host to rearrange its cytoskeleton, resulting in the generation of membrane ruffles that permit uptake of the S. typhimurium cells. Accordingly, many SPI-1 effectors have biochemical activities that facilitate this specific cellular reprogramming, such as the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor SopE/SopE2 and the GTPase-activating protein SptP that act upon the host cell Rho family GTPase proteins that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics. Another facet of SPI-1 effector function is that several effectors target related processes to facilitate bacterial entry into host cells. In addition to SopE/SopE2 and SptP, which manipulate Rho protein signaling, the SipA and SipC effectors directly influence actin dynamics through interaction with actin or its regulatory proteins (6Zhou D. Galán J. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 1293-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Once inside the cell, S. typhimurium resides within a membrane-bound compartment, the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). The SPI-2 T3SS translocates a separate set of effectors into the host cell cytosol through the SCV membrane to ensure survival and replication of intracellular bacteria and is critical for S. typhimurium virulence (7Shea J.E. Beuzon C.R. Gleeson C. Mundy R. Holden D.W. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ochman H. Soncini F.C. Solomon F. Groisman E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, unlike with several SPI-1 effectors, the predicted or demonstrated biochemical activities of SPI-2 effectors do not offer much insight into their biological functions. For example, analogous to the SPI-1 effectors SopE and SptP, the SPI-2 effectors SseL and SspH2 also possess opposing biochemical activities, catalyzing deubiquitination and E3 ubiquitin ligation reactions, respectively (10Rytkönen A. Poh J. Garmendia J. Boyle C. Thompson A. Liu M. Freemont P. Hinton J.C. Holden D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3502-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Le Negrate G.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4864-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, knowledge of the specific biological functions of these SPI-2 effectors is largely lacking and is not obviously inferred from their enzymatic activities. In general, the mechanisms of action and the host cell targets of many SPI-2 effectors are still poorly understood (13Abrahams G.L. Hensel M. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The genomic context and sequence information are often insufficient to accurately identify T3SS substrates. For example, many bona fide effectors are situated distally from the loci that encode their cognate T3SS (14Bhavsar A.P. Auweter S.D. Finlay B.B. Future Microbiol. 2010; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As a complementary approach to identifying T3SS substrates, proteomics offers direct detection of these proteins, as high sensitivity mass spectrometry can readily identify proteins that are secreted into culture supernatants. A combination of the annotated genome sequence, the judicious use of T3SS mutants, inducible secretion conditions, and quantitative mass spectrometry provides a powerful platform to directly measure the SPI-2 secretome. In this study we employed stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to identify and characterize S. typhimurium effectors secreted by the SPI-2 T3SS. SILAC utilizes selective metabolic labeling of proteins by growing cells in the presence of differentially labeled amino acid isotopologs, allowing different experimental conditions (e.g. specific versus nonspecific interactors) to be mass encoded. After liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry, the relative abundances of proteins in the original sample are inferred from the isotopic ratios of the labeled peptides. Thus, the peptide mass also indicates its origin from either the control or experimental samples, allowing for the elimination of unspecific background that is equally abundant under control and experimental conditions and thereby reliably identifying proteins specific to the experimental sample (15Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Ong S.E. Nielsen M. Foster L.J. Mann M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 16Rogers L.D. Kristensen A.R. Boyle E.C. Robinson D.P. Ly R.T. Finlay B.B. Foster L.J. J. Proteomics. 2008; 71: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We used SILAC technology to explore two important aspects of S. typhimurium effectors in this study: identification and function within the host cell environment. We developed a straightforward screen to rapidly and comprehensively analyze the entire complement of S. typhimurium effectors secreted by the SPI-2 T3SS. This screen did not require extensive genetic manipulation and in one run successfully identified many of the known S. typhimurium SPI-2 effectors. Furthermore, using this approach, we generated a strong candidate list of novel SPI-2 T3SS-secreted proteins, including the L21 protein of the large ribosomal subunit. We also used SILAC methodology to screen for host interaction partners of effectors translocated by the SPI-2 T3SS. This interaction partner screen identified previously published host protein-effector pairs and revealed 11 novel interactions, three of which were further confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. The newly identified interactions point toward a set of biological processes, such as host cell attachment, innate immunity, and cell cycling, in which these effectors fulfill their respective functions. Some of these processes have been understudied in the context of S. typhimurium infection, and our results suggest that they merit future investigation, further underscoring the utility of SILAC technology. The technology outlined in this study proved to be specific and sensitive and provides a tool for the identification of bacterial effectors and the study of their function within the host cell. Deletions of the lysA, argH, and fliF genes were performed using allelic exchange. Briefly, 1 kb of flanking sequence for each gene was amplified and cloned into pRE112 using compatible restriction enzyme sites designed to include a 14-amino acid scar of the deleted gene between the flanks. Deletion constructs were transformed into SM10λpir and conjugated into recipient S. typhimurium SL1344 wild type or ssaR strains. Plasmid integration was driven by antibiotic selection, and subsequent plasmid excision was driven by sucrose counterselection and verified by antibiotic sensitivity. Gene deletion was verified by PCR, auxotrophy was verified by growth in limiting medium, and flagellar impairment was verified by motility assay. S. typhimurium lysA argH fliF derivatives were inoculated at 1:100 from an overnight culture into 500 ml of modified low phosphate, low magnesium (LPM) medium pH 5.8 (17Coombes B.K. Brown N.F. Valdez Y. Brumell J.H. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49804-49815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Modifications to LPM medium included increasing MgCl2 to 24 μm and replacing casamino acids with individual amino acids at the following concentrations: Ala, 2.8%; Asp, 6.3%; Cys, 0.3%; Glu, 21.1%; Gly, 2.2%; His, 2.7%; Ile, 5.6%; Leu, 8.4%; Met, 2.7%; Phe, 4.6%; Pro, 9.9%; Ser, 5.6%; Thr, 4.2%; Trp, 1.1%; Tyr, 6.1%; Val, 5.0%; Arg, 3.6%; and Lys, 7.5%). The SPI-2 secretion-competent strain was inoculated into LPM medium containing [4,4,5,5-D4]lysine and [U-13C6]arginine, and the SPI-2 secretion mutant (ssaR) strain was inoculated into LPM medium containing natural abundance, isotopically labeled arginine and lysine. Cultures were grown for 8 h at 37°C with shaking at 225 rpm. Bacteria were harvested, and culture supernatants were passed through a 0.22-μm filter. Filtered supernatants from the two cultures were pooled in an equivalent ratio based upon optical density measurement of the culture at the time of harvest. Supernatants were concentrated successively using a nitrogen-stirring cell (Amicon) and centrifugal concentrators (Amicon) with 10,000-MWCO (molecular weight cut-off) filters. Filters were washed with TBS, and the washes were pooled with the supernatant and further concentrated. Secreted proteins were precipitated overnight using three volumes of 100% EtOH, 50 mm sodium acetate, and 20 μg of glycogen. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE or isoelectric focusing and subjected to in-gel digestion as indicated below. STM2949 and rplU including 1 kb of upstream sequence was amplified from S. typhimurium SL1344 genomic DNA and cloned using SalI and BglII restriction sites to replace gogB in the pWSK129 derivative pgogB-HA, which encodes a double hemaggluttinin epitope tag (18Coombes B.K.

These plasmids, renamed pWSK129ptpS-2xHA and pWSK129-L21–2xHA, were transformed into wild type S. typhimurium SL1344- and SPI-2-deficient strains. In vitro SPI-2 secretion assays were performed essentially as described previously (18Coombes B.K. Wickham M.E. Brown N.F. Lemire S. Bossi L. Hsiao W.W. Brinkman F.S. Finlay B.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 817-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Secreted or total protein fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and probed with rat anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-DnaK (Stressgen Biotechnologies), and anti-SseB (laboratory-raised) antibodies. For expression of effectors in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (ATCC), effector genes were amplified from S. typhimurium SL1344 genomic DNA and inserted into a pcDNA3 expression vector engineered to include an N-terminal tandem hemagglutinin (HA) tag (pcDNA3(2HA)) using SrfI and NotI restriction sites, as described previously (16Rogers L.D. Kristensen A.R. Boyle E.C. Robinson D.P. Ly R.T. Finlay B.B. Foster L.J. J. Proteomics. 2008; 71: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A bacterial expression plasmid was engineered based on the pGEX-6P-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to carry an N-terminal triple HA tag by insertion of three consecutive hemagglutinin sequences between the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Effector genes were amplified from S. typhimurium SL1344 genomic DNA and inserted into pGEX(3HA) using either the XhoI and NotI or SalI and NotI restriction sites. The gene encoding oxysterol-binding protein 1 was amplified from cDNA clone ATCC 10659005 (ImageID 4560111) and inserted into the unmodified pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) using the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites. HEK293T cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 4500 mg/liter glucose and 4 mm l-glutamine and supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% GlutaMax, and 10% fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen). To screen for interaction partners using effectors expressed in HEK293T (see Fig. 4, strategy A), cells were transferred into arginine- and lysine-free DMEM (Caisson Laboratories Inc.) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen) and either 36.5 mg/liter [4,4,5,5-D4]lysine and 21 mg/liter [U-13C6]arginine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), for heavy control cells, or expanded in regular growth medium for effector transfection as described previously (16Rogers L.D. Kristensen A.R. Boyle E.C. Robinson D.P. Ly R.T. Finlay B.B. Foster L.J. J. Proteomics. 2008; 71: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To screen for interaction partners using effectors expressed in Escherichia coli (Fig. 4, strategy B), cells were transferred into arginine- and lysine-free DMEM (Caisson Laboratories Inc.) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen) and either 36.5 mg/liter [4,4,5,5-D4]-lysine and 21 mg/liter [U-13C6]-arginine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) for heavy cells or equimolar amounts of normal isotopic abundance arginine and lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) for light cells and maintained for at least five cell divisions in these media prior to immunoprecipitation experiments. HEK293T cells (ATCC) were seeded at a density of ∼1 × 106 cells/dish in 10-cm dishes and transfected the following day with 8 μg/dish Ca3(PO4)2-complexed DNA. Cell lysates were harvested 48 h after transfection. E. coli BL21 DE3 was transformed with pGEX-6P-3 derivatives containing cloned effectors and grown at 30°C with shaking (225 rpm) until an A600 of ∼0.4 was reached. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and growth was continued for 3 or 16 h at 37 or 16°C, respectively. Cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml DNase, 10 μg/ml RNase, and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 16,000 psi, and lysate was clarified by successive centrifugation steps at 8,000 and 30,000 × g for 10 and 30 min, respectively. All purification steps were performed on an AKTApurifier (GE Healthcare). Clarified lysate was applied to a GSTrap column (GE Healthcare) and eluted in a single step with GST elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm glutathione, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). Appropriate fractions were pooled and loaded onto a preparative S200 column (GE Healthcare) that was run using S200 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Appropriate fractions were pooled and diluted 3-fold with MonoQ buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) prior to loading onto a MonoQ anion exchange column (GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of MonoQ buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) applied over 20 column volumes. Appropriate fractions were pooled, concentrated if necessary, and frozen at −80°C. Protein concentration was determined using Coomassie Plus Bradford assay reagent (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were activated by treatment with ice-cold HCl and incubated with 1 mg/ml normal mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or mouse-α-HA (clone 2C16) at 4 °C overnight. HEK293T cells were washed with PBS and harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 (all from Sigma)) completed with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Debris was pelleted at 16,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min, and total protein concentration in the supernatants was determined as indicated above; 15 mg of total protein were used for each immunoprecipitation. For strategy B (see Fig. 4), ∼100 pmol of purified effector was added to lysates labeled with heavy isotopes for each immunoprecipitation. Lysates containing effector protein and control lysates were independently precleared with 150 μl of IgG-coated Sepharose beads (30 min, 4 °C), and subsequent immunoprecipitations were performed with 75 μl of anti-HA antibody-coated Sepharose beads (2 h, 4 °C). Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, bound protein was eluted with 6 m urea/2 m thiourea, and eluates from both samples were pooled. Protein mixtures were supplemented with 20 μg of glycogen and precipitated with a 5-volume excess of ethanol and a final concentration of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Protein were pelleted at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Culture supernatants of the secretome analysis were highly complex, and thus proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE or isoelectric focusing and subjected to in-gel digestion prior to mass spectrometric analysis essentially as described previously (19Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7787) Google Scholar). Briefly, gel slices were minced, washed to remove stain using NH4HCO3/EtOH, and dehydrated with EtOH. Proteins were reduced with DTT, and free sulfhydryl groups were blocked with iodoacetamide. Gel pieces were subjected to repeated washing/dehydration steps as outlined above, and excess EtOH was removed by vacuum centrifugation. Proteins were digested with trypsin, and the remaining gel pieces were successively extracted with MeCN/TFA/AcOH, MeCN/AcOH, and MeCN. The organic solvents from all extracts were removed by vacuum centrifugation. Samples immunoprecipitated from solution in the interaction partner screen were less complex and were therefore subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) without additional SDS-PAGE fractionation. Immunoprecipitates were resolubilized in a small volume of 6 m urea/2 m thiourea and reduced with 1 μg of DTT for 30 min at room temperature, and cysteine residues were acetylated with 5 μg of iodoacetamide for 20 min at room temperature. Proteins were then treated with 1 μg of LysC (3 h at room temperature), diluted with 4 volumes of 50 mm NH4HCO3, and incubated with 1 μg of trypsin at 37 °C overnight. Tryptic peptides were diluted in 3% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.5% acetic acid and bound to a C18 resin. The resin was washed with 0.5% acetic acid, and peptides were eluted with 0.5% acetic acid, 80% acetonitrile for mass spectrometric analysis. Mass spectrometry, data analysis, and database searches were performed as described previously (16Rogers L.D. Kristensen A.R. Boyle E.C. Robinson D.P. Ly R.T. Finlay B.B. Foster L.J. J. Proteomics. 2008; 71: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, digested peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a LTQ-OrbitrapXL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The LTQ-OrbitrapXL was coupled on-line to Agilent 1100 series nanoflow HPLC instruments using a nanospray ionization source (Proxeon Biosystems) holding columns packed into 15-cm-long, 75-μm-inner diameter fused silica emitters (8-μm-diameter opening pulled on a P-2000 laser puller from Sutter Instruments) using 3-μm-diameter ReproSil Pur C18 beads. Buffer A consisted of 0.5% acetic acid, and buffer B consisted of 0.5% acetic acid and 80% acetonitrile. Gradients were run from 6% B to 30% B over 60 min and then 30% B to 80% B in the next 10 min, held at 80% B for 5 min, and then dropped to 6% B for another 15 min to recondition the column. The LTQ-OrbitrapXL was set to acquire a full-range scan at 60,000 resolution from 350 to 1500 Thomson units (Th) in the Orbitrap and to simultaneously fragment the top five peptide ions in each cycle in the LTQ. For immunoprecipitates, proteins were identified using Mascot (v2.2, Matrix Science) to search against the international protein index (IPI) human database with S. typhimurium effectors and common contaminants added along with concatenated reversed sequences (v3.69, 154,798 sequences), using the following criteria: electrospray ionization-ion trap fragmentation characteristics and tryptic specificity with up to one missed cleavage; ±10 ppm and ±0.6 Da accuracy for MS and MS/MS measurements, respectively; cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification; N-terminal protein acetylation, methionine oxidation, and duplex ([2H4]Lys, [13C6]Arg) SILAC as appropriate. Peptides matching these criteria with ion scores greater than 28 were determined to meet a false discovery rate of ∼1%, so we considered proteins identified if at least two such peptides were observed. Quantitation of SILAC data for immunoprecipitations was performed using MSQuant (PMID 19888749). The analytical variability of SILAC data in the types of experiments performed here is typically <30%, and biological variability was addressed in these experiments by performing at least three independent replicates of each experiment. For the interaction partner screen, each effector was analyzed in triplicate, and binding partners were listed here only if they gave ratios >3 and were detected with more than two unique peptides in at least two replicates. For the secretome data, all identification and quantification was done using MaxQuant (PMID 19029910) with the default settings for Orbitrap data. Cell lysates were generated as described above. For oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP)-SseL co-immunoprecipitations, HEK293T lysates containing 3 mg of total protein were mixed with 2 μg of purified HA3-SseL. Mixtures were precleared with 70 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C, and supernatants were incubated with either 5 μg of goat α-OSBP (Abcam) or mouse α-HA (clone 2C16) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C and subsequent centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min. After three washes in lysis buffer, beads were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer for Western blot analysis. Sgt1-SspH2 and Bub3-SspH2 co-immunoprecipitations were performed using empty vector (pcDNA3(2HA)) or SspH2 (pcDNA3(2HASspH2))-transfected HEK293T lysate containing 2 mg of total protein. Lysates were precleared as described above and then incubated with 1–5 μg of either mouse α-HA (clone 2C16), mouse IgG, mouse α-Sgt1, or mouse α-Bub3 (BD Biosciences) antibodies. Immune complex capture and washing were performed essentially as outlined above. Proteins were separated on 10–12% acrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% w/v skim milk powder, 0.1% v/v Tween in PBS, or TBS and incubated in the same buffer with primary and secondary antibodies as follows: mouse α-HA (clone 2C16) 1:3,000; rat α-HA (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) 1:2,500; goat α-OSBP (Abcam) 1:1,000; mouse α-SGT1 (BD Biosciences) 1:5,000; mouse α-Bub3 (BD Biosciences) 1:1,000; goat α-mouse HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) 1:10,000; and rabbit α-goat HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1:5,000. Proteins were detected with ECL detection reagent (GE Healthcare) and BioMax light film for chemiluminescence (Kodak). We designed a quantitative proteomic screen to identify the repertoire of proteins secreted by the S. typhimurium SPI-2 T3SS (Fig. 1). Isogenic strains of S. typhimurium SL1344 were created containing deletions of argH, lysA, and fliF. Deletion of fliF prevents secretion of flagellar proteins and was included because preliminary experiments had detected excessive amounts of the flagellin protein FliC that was masking the detection of lower abundance proteins. Initial SILAC experiments in S. typhimurium indicated that even when fed arginine and lysine, the bacteria would still produce about 5% of these amino acids, so deletions in the arginine and lysine biosynthetic pathways (argH and lysA) generated the requisite auxotrophies to allow differential labeling of the bacterial proteome. The lysA and argH genes were specifically targeted for deletion to avoid impingements on alternate pathways with shared precursor metabolites in the arginine and lysine biosynthetic pathways, e.g. diaminopimelic acid biosynthesis for cell wall assembly. To differentiate between general secreted proteins and those secreted via the SPI-2 T3SS, an additional deletion"
https://openalex.org/W2035418438,"We have analyzed the role of the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) in epidermal homeostasis. Reduced keratinocyte proliferation is found in interfollicular epidermis of mice lacking the thyroid hormone binding isoforms TRα1 and TRβ (KO mice). Similar results were obtained in hypothyroid animals, showing the important role of the liganded TRs in epidermal proliferation. In addition, KO and hypothyroid animals display decreased hyperplasia in response to 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate. Both receptor isoforms play overlapping functional roles in the skin because mice lacking individually TRα1 or TRβ also present a proliferative defect but not as marked as that found in double KO mice. Defective proliferation in KO mice is associated with reduction of cyclin D1 expression and up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p19 and p27. Paradoxically, ERK and AKT activity and expression of downstream targets, such as AP-1 components, are increased in KO mice. Increased p65/NF-κB and STAT3 phosphorylation and, as a consequence, augmented expression of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines is also found in these animals. These results show that thyroid hormones and their receptors are important mediators of skin proliferation and demonstrate that TRs act as endogenous inhibitors of skin inflammation, most likely due to interference with AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT3 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2078358752,"Phosphonoformic acid (PFA, foscarnet) belongs to a class of antiviral drugs that inhibit the human cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase (UL54) by mimicking the pyrophosphate leaving group of the nucleotide transfer reaction. Difficulties expressing UL54 have hampered investigation of the precise structural requirements rendering inhibition by this drug. However, a previously engineered chimeric DNA polymerase, constructed by mutating the homologous polymerase from bacteriophage RB69 (gp43) to express several variable elements from UL54, can bypass this obstacle because of its favorable expression and acquired sensitivity to PFA (Tchesnokov, E. P., Obikhod, A., Schinazi, R. F., and Götte, M. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 34218–34228). Here, we compare two crystal structures that depict the chimeric DNA polymerase with and without PFA bound. PFA is visualized for the first time in the active site of a DNA polymerase, where interactions are resolved between the PPi mimic and two basic residues absolutely conserved in the fingers domain of family B polymerases. PFA also chelates metal ion B, the cation that contacts the triphosphate tail of the incoming nucleotide. These DNA complexes utilize a primer-template pair enzymatically chain-terminated by incorporation of acyclo-GMP, the phosphorylated form of the anti-herpes drug acyclovir. We postulate that the V478W mutation present in the chimera is critical in that it pushes the fingers domain to more readily adopt the closed conformation whether or not the drug is bound. The closed state of the fingers domain traps the variant polymerase in the untranslocated state and increases affinity for PFA. This finding provides a model for the mechanism of UL54 stalling by PFA.

The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 3The abbreviations used are: HCMVhuman cytomegalovirusPFAphosphonoformic acid or foscarnet3′-OH3′ hydroxylTLStranslation, libration, and screw-rotation. belongs to the herpesviridae family, into which several important human pathogens are classified. A primary infection of this virus in pregnant mothers can be devastating to the developing fetus, resulting in several congenital disorders. Although a substantial portion of the global adult population is currently HCMV-seropositive, a functional immune system can hold the virus in check. For immunocompromised individuals, on the other hand, infection with HCMV presents a severe threat (1Mercorelli B. Sinigalia E. Loregian A. Palù G. Rev. Med.

In this setting, infection with the virus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. human cytomegalovirus phosphonoformic acid or foscarnet 3′ hydroxyl translation, libration, and screw-rotation. The limited pharmacological options available for treatment of HCMV largely consist of nucleoside analog inhibitors that target the gene product of UL54, a family B DNA polymerase. Although some inhibitors, such as cidofovir, are chemically synthesized as acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, most nucleoside analogs require monophosphorylation by a viral kinase, such as UL97 in HCMV, before other cellular kinases convert these drugs into triphosphorylated substrates of the DNA polymerase (4De Clercq E. Holý A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 928-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Following incorporation into the viral DNA, these non-natural nucleotides interfere with subsequent DNA synthesis by merit of either a distorted or absent 3′-hydroxyl (3′-OH) moiety. The nucleoside analog acyclovir, for example, becomes triphosphorylated to acyclo-GTP (Fig. 1), which contains both a guanine base and an acyclic sugar moiety lacking a 3′-OH that chain terminates DNA synthesis after incorporation at the primer terminus. Although acyclovir inhibits HCMV to a certain extent, this drug is not approved for treatment of HCMV (5Spector S.A. Kelley E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Rather, acyclovir serves primarily against herpes simplex viruses (HSVs), which are also members of herpesviridae and closely related to HCMV. Cidofovir and ganciclovir, on the other hand, provide approved treatment of HCMV, serving as nonobligate chain terminators that the polymerase extends poorly (6Magee W.C. Aldern K.A. Hostetler K.Y. Evans D.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2008; 52: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Reardon J.E. J. Biol.

Phosphonoformic acid (PFA or foscarnet; Fig. 1) is a broad spectrum antiviral mimicking the pyrophosphate (PPi) leaving group of the nucleotide transfer reaction. For the treatment of HCMV, PFA provides alternative inhibition of UL54 in second line regimens after accumulated resistance compromises nucleoside analog-based therapies. PFA additionally inhibits HIV-1 RT by trapping a DNA-bound pretranslocation complex, which suggests a common mechanism of action against other polymerases (9Marchand B. Tchesnokov E.P. Götte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3337-3346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Beilhartz G.L. Wendeler M. Baichoo N. Rausch J. Le Grice S. Götte M. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Many questions concerning the exact binding site of PFA have remained elusive, however, in part because poor expression levels of recombinant UL54 have precluded prior crystallographic investigation. Moreover, it is still unclear why PFA preferentially inhibits herpesviridae DNA polymerases, whereas other family B polymerases, such as RB69 DNA polymerase (gp43) or the replicative eukaryotic DNA polymerases δ or ∈, are left unaffected by the drug (11Li L. Murphy K.M. Kanevets U. Reha-Krantz L.J. Genetics. 2005; 170: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The fingers domain in family B polymerases consists of two long helices, N and P, which contain two highly conserved basic protein residues (Arg-482 in helix N and Lys-560 in helix P) known to interact with the triphosphate tail of incoming nucleotides. Based on the hypothesis that the intervening variable regions between these conserved side chains might influence PFA inhibition in herpesviridae, a chimeric DNA polymerase, derived from the parental sequence of RB69 gp43, was engineered to express several of these variable elements originating from the fingers domain of UL54 (12Tchesnokov E.P. Obikhod A. Schinazi R.F. Götte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26439-26446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These elements consisted specifically of three blocks of amino acids adjacent to the absolutely conserved basic residues, Arg-482 and Lys-560 in gp43, therefore allowing the chimeric mutations considerable sequential proximity to the proposed PPi binding site (see Fig. 4). Interestingly, these modifications transformed RB69 gp43 into a PFA-sensitive polymerase, without compromising high expression of the recombinant enzyme. Here, we report the first crystal structure of any DNA polymerase-binding PFA. By comparing DNA complexes of the chimeric DNA polymerase with and without PFA bound, the exact structural requirements for PFA inhibition are unveiled. The primer termini in these structures are chain-terminated by acyclo-GMP, thus providing an added first glimpse of acyclovir in its fully metabolized active form at the primer terminus. We provide evidence that the sensitivity of the chimera to PFA arises primarily because of the V478W mutation, which induces a clash with helices of the N-terminal domain when the fingers open. Oligonucleotides for biochemical assays were purchased from Invitrogen. Primers were 5′-labeled with 32P and gel-purified as described previously (13Tchesnokov E.P. Gilbert C. Boivin G. Götte M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1440-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Primer and template oligonucleotides for crystallization were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX) and gel-purified on 16% polyacrylamide denaturing gel, prior to desalting over Waters (Milford, MA) Sep-Pak C18 columns. New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) kindly provided acyclo-GTP, whereas deoxynucleotides were purchased from Fermentas Life Sciences. PFA was manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich, and PEG 20,000 stocks were purchased from Hampton Research (Aliso Viejo, CA). All other reagents were from either Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher and of the highest quality available. The gp43 coding sequence was cloned into pPR-IBA1 (IBA) using the BsaI site to generate pPR-IBA1/gp43. This construct facilitates protein purification through Strep-tag affinity chromatography (IBA). The chimeric form of gp43 contains nine amino acid substitutions in helices N and P: V478W/F479V/N480S and I557M/N558A/R559L/L561V/L562T/I563C, respectively (see Fig. 4) (12Tchesnokov E.P. Obikhod A. Schinazi R.F. Götte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26439-26446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). D222A and D327A substitutions were introduced to eliminate the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of the polymerase for biochemical assays. The chimeric DNA polymerase used for crystallization only required mutation of one of the two catalytic aspartates (D222A), which also eliminates 3′-5′ exonuclease activity efficiently. Variant enzymes were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, utilizing PfuUltra DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to catalyze PCR according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The RB69 DNA polymerase wild-type, mutant, and chimeric enzymes were expressed as described previously, except from within the vector pPR-IBA1 (14Hogg M. Wallace S.S. Doublié S. EMBO. J. 2004; 23: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This expression plasmid encodes a C-terminal Strep-tag, which facilitated purification of all enzymes by affinity chromatography (IBA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. IC50 experiments utilized the following templates: T1 = 5′-CCAATATTCACCATCAAGGCTTGACGTGACTTCACTCCACTATACCACTC and T2 = 5′-GGAAATCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACCTGAAAGCGAAAGGGAAAC. The underlined nucleotides are the portions of the templates that anneal to the primers, which were of the sequences: P1 (5′-GAGTGGTATAGTGGAGTGAA) and P2 (5′-GTTTCCCTTTCGCTTT). The assay was conducted with 100 nm duplex DNA, obtained from annealing T1 to P1, and preincubated for 5–10 min at 37 °C with a given DNA polymerase in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. To compare different enzymes in single nucleotide incorporation assays, we adjusted the enzyme concentration and the time point of the reaction such that ∼40–50% of the primer substrate was used at the saturating concentration of dGTP (25 μm). Nucleotide incorporation was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of three reaction volumes of formamide containing traces of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. The samples were then subjected to 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by phosphorimaging. The incorporation of single nucleotides was quantified as the fraction of the DNA substrate (primer n) converted to product (primer n+1). The extent of PFA-mediated inhibition of nucleotide incorporation was determined by plotting the percentage of dGMP incorporation against the concentration of PFA. IC50 values were calculated by fitting 11 data points to a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) equation using GraphPad Prism (version 5.0). Standard deviations for all of the experiments were determined on the basis of at least three independent replicates and represented a maximum of 20% of the reported IC50 value. Oligonucleotides for crystallization consisted of the following sequences: P (5′-GCGGCTGTCATAA) and T (5′-CGTCTTATGACAGCCGCG), where the underlined portion of the template anneals to the primer, placing dCMP in templating position. The template 3′ end contains a dGMP that overhangs the primer and is required for essential crystal contacts between adjacent asymmetric units (15Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Chimeric RB69 DNA polymerase was dialyzed into a buffered solution containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT and concentrated to 7 mg/ml. A reaction mixture for crystallization was then prepared by reacting 42 μm concentrated polymerase, 50 μm P/T, and 1 mm acyclo-GTP for 30 min at 25 °C. PFA (10 mm) and a crystallization buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 33 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 6 mm MgCl2 were then added, bringing the final volume of reaction mixture to 12 μl. PFA was omitted for reactions intended to crystallize polymerase, P/T, and acyclo-GTP only. An aliquot from 1 ml of reservoir solutions containing 3–5% (w/v) PEG 20 000, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1–7.5), and 0.1% (v/v) glycerol was mixed with an equal volume of reaction mixture to create a 1-μl hanging drop. After 5–9 days of vapor equilibration at 25 °C, primitive orthorhombic crystals grew to a final size up to 100 × 220 × 40 μm3. These crystals were cryoprotected by adding 0.5 μl of a solution containing 7% (w/v) PEG 20,000 and 50% (v/v) glycerol directly to the hanging drop and plunged into liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a MAR m300 CCD detector at Beamline 23ID-B of the advanced photon source under cryocooled conditions (100 K). Measurements of intensity were integrated, scaled, and merged with version 1.98.4 of Denzo/Scalepack, yielding complete 2.7 Å data sets (see Table 1) (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Merging observations from four crystals produced the high redundancy reported for the PFA complex. Although the Rmerge is high, as can be expected from a data set with high redundancy, the RFriedel indicates that the data are of very high quality (17Rould M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsAcyclo-GMP, gp43-UL54 chimeraPFA, acyclo-GMP, gp43-UL54 chimeraComplex TypeClosed binaryUntranslocated ternaryProtein Data Bank code3KD13KD5Data collectionSpace groupP212121P212121Cell dimensions (a, b, c) (Å)78.5, 121.7, 131.577.9, 122.4, 133.3No. of crystals14Wavelength (Å)1.031.03Resolution (Å)50-2.66 (2.76-2.66)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.40-2.70 (2.80-2.70)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.Rmerge (%)aRmerge = Σ(|Ihkl,i − <Ihkl>|)/Σ(Ihkl,i).10.6 (100)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.11.3 (100)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.RFriedel (%)bRFriedel = Σ(|I+ − I−|)/Σ(<I>).7.2 (67.9)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.3.4 (44.6)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.I/σI17.7 (2.2)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.26.9 (3.4)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.Completeness (%)100 (100)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.100 (100)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.Redundancy7.6 (7.2)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.23.4 (21.1)dHighest resolution data are shown in parentheses.No. of reflections281,195 (36,963)eThe total number of reflections is shown.

Open table in a new tab The structure without PFA was solved by isomorphous replacement using an RB69 ternary complex devoid of all nonprotein atoms as a starting model (Protein Data Bank code 2OZS) (18Zahn K.E. Belrhali H. Wallace S.S. Doublié S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10551-10561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), after all nine amino acid side chains mutated in the chimeric enzyme were cropped to the β-carbon to avoid introduction of any model bias at these sites. Rigid body refinement was conducted with CNS on each protein domain, prior to subsequent TLS and residual B-factor refinement in Refmac (19Brunger A.T. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 20Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The TLS model excluded both DNA and ligands and was based roughly on protein domains, where nonconsecutive regions of the same domain were further broken into unique TLS groups. Fo − Fc maps revealed interpretable density for the chimeric mutations and duplex DNA, which unambiguously showed chain termination by acyclo-GMP. Chimeric side chains and DNA were built with the modeling software Coot (21Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Because the chimeric RB69 polymerase does not contain the D327A mutation, a single metal ion was present in the exonuclease domain. The complete model was further refined by iterative rebuilding with Coot and refinement in Refmac. The PFA complex was built using Fo − Fo isomorphous difference maps generated with phases from the model lacking PFA, which was made possible by the high degree of isomorphism between the two crystal forms. The resulting electron density maps revealed without ambiguity that PFA was centered in the polymerase active site. Although several side chain rearrangements were indicated by peak-hole pairs, only minor rebuilding and refinement was needed to obtain the fully refined structure. The refined B-factors in the deposited Protein Data Bank files represent residual B-factors. The B-factors indicated in Table 1 were averaged from anisotropic B-factors, derived from our refined TLS model by the software TLSANU and reported to avoid any unintentional misrepresentation of these values (22Howlin B. Butler S. Moss D. Harris G. Driessen H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 622-624Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Coordinates and structure factors were deposited into the Protein Data Bank under codes 3KD1 and 3KD5 for the complexes without and with PFA, respectively. The chimeric DNA polymerase complexed to a primer-template pair readily co-crystallized in both the presence and the absence of 10 mm PFA after the primer was chain-terminated by enzymatic incorporation of acyclo-GMP, yielding diffraction quality crystals able to scatter synchrotron radiation to 2.7 Å resolution. Unexpectedly, both of these crystal types indexed with primitive orthorhombic lattices and unit cell parameters characteristic of previous ternary complexes, even though the next complementary nucleotide following the acyclo-GMP was not present in these crystallization reactions. Subsequent isomorphous replacement verified this unanticipated result and showed that the fingers domain occupied the closed conformation typical of ternary complexes, regardless of the addition of PFA. The final models with and without PFA were refined to respective Rfree values of 25 and 26%, while maintaining close geometric agreement with reference bond lengths and angles (Table 1). Historically, capturing a closed ternary complex (enzyme, primer-template, and nucleotide) of any replicative DNA polymerase has required the presence of DNA lacking a functional 3′-OH, in addition to an incoming dNTP complementary to the templating nucleotide (15Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 18Zahn K.E. Belrhali H. Wallace S.S. Doublié S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10551-10561Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the active site, the dNTP induces a conformational change, closing the fingers domain and trapping the complex at the enzymatic step directly preceding nucleophilic attack on the α-phosphate. A similar strategy utilizes a functional 3′-OH but requires a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide to stall the nucleotide transfer reaction (24Batra V.K. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.C. Wilson S.H. Structure. 2006; 14: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Although both structures of the chimeric DNA polymerase depict the closed conformation of the fingers domain, the untranslocated state of the DNA retains the 3′-incorporated acyclo-GMP at the insertion site (Fig. 2A), which distinguishes these models uniquely from previous structures. The complex without PFA is best described as a closed binary complex, to emphasize the closed configuration of the fingers domain in relation to conventional binary complexes that orient the fingers in the open conformation. The PFA complex is conceptually similar to previously characterized closed ternary complexes, given that this new complex also shows a closed conformation and contains three different molecules—protein, DNA, and PFA—in the biological assembly. We expound the unique configuration of the DNA in the PFA structure by classifying it as an untranslocated, closed ternary complex. This liganded structure reflects the likely conformation of gp43 directly following phosphoryl transfer but prior to dissociation of PPi, which is mimicked here by PFA. Difference Fourier methods were employed to compare diffraction data collected from isomorphous crystals grown with and without PFA (25Stein M. Spencer D. Kantor A. Lakier R. Lachter J. Ben-Yosef R. Bezwoda W.R. Tumori. 1994; 80: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The 2.7 Å Fo − Fo electron density map presented a large positive peak centered in the polymerase active site, into which PFA was unambiguously modeled (Fig. 2A). The orientation of PFA suggests that the drug engages in electrostatic interactions with the two absolutely conserved basic residues of the fingers domain, Arg-482 and Lys-560 (Fig. 2B). By superimposing this structure with a previous translocated, closed ternary complex, we observed that the carboxyl group of PFA overlaps with the β-phosphate of an incoming dATP such that the phosphonate group mimics the γ-phosphate (Fig. 3A). Intriguingly, no other contacts to PFA were seen from any of the protein residues mutated to match the HCMV sequence (Fig. 3B). Together with the propensity of the chimeric DNA polymerase to crystallize with the fingers closed, these findings suggest that sensitivity to PFA is a function of polymerase conformation, rather than directed by specific side chain interactions unique to UL54. PFA also interacts with the coordination sphere of metal ion B, contributing two contacts. Because PFA is known to chelate cations, this property appears essential for the capacity of the drug to mimic PPi in the polymerase active site. Furthermore, metal ion A was resolved in the PFA structure, coordinated by single contacts from Asp-411 and Asp-623, in addition to two contacts from the backbone phosphate located 5′ of the primer terminus (Fig. 2A). The remaining two sites of the coordination sphere of this cation were filled by partially occupied water molecules. Metal ion A is not usually observed in translocated, closed ternary complexes of RB69 gp43 crystallized in the presence of Mg2+ because chain-terminated primers do not include a 3′-OH and therefore cannot complete the coordination requirements of the metal ion, unless a water molecule is able to satisfy this role (23Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). In the PFA complex, the O3′ of the n − 1 nucleotide in the untranslocated primer strand contacts metal ion A in a manner similar to that modeled for 3′-OH in translocated, closed ternary complexes of polymerase β captured with nonhydrolyzable nucleotide triphosphate analogs (24Batra V.K. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.C. Wilson S.H. Structure. 2006; 14: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This comparison suggests that the PFA complex represents the catalytic step directly following phosphoryl transfer, prior to dissociation of PPi. Unambiguous assignment of metal ions in polymerase structures is complicated because Mg2+ is devoid of anomalous signal and its atomic mass is such that its electron density cannot easily be distinguished from those of sodium cations or water molecules. Given that magnesium salts were present in both the crystallization reaction mixture and in the reservoir solution, we assigned the ions in the PFA complex as Mg2+. The refined PFA structure exhibits an average coordination geometry of 2.2 Å over all 12 contacts, supporting that Mg2+ ions could occupy both the octahedral cation-binding sites (24Batra V.K. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.C. Wilson S.H. Structure. 2006; 14: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The use of calcium or manganese has resolved metal ion A in crystal structures of RB69 gp43 previously, although these ions are not expected to be physiological metals (15Franklin M.C. Wang J.

Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Calcium is coordinated at a greater distance than magnesium and inhibits DNA synthesis by distorting the active site. Manganese binds with higher affinity than magnesium and reduces the fidelity of DNA synthesis through relaxed coordination requirements (27Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.C.

This study provides a rational foundation for understanding the dengue virus-macrophage interaction and the role of CLEC5A in dengue virus-induced lethal disease. Macrophage effector functions can be triggered by the interactions of activating receptors on the macrophage surface with appropriate ligands. The activation of macrophages is beneficial in the immune response against many infectious pathogens, but dengue virus infection can trigger excessive cytokine release, which contributes to mortality by various mechanisms, including increased capillary permeability (1Wilder-Smith A. Schwartz E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). There is no vaccine or effective antiviral treatment against dengue virus, which is the most common arboviral (or arthropod-borne) cause of disease worldwide and a major cause of mortality in endemic regions (1Wilder-Smith A. Schwartz E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The World Health Organization estimates that there are 50 million dengue virus infections each year with 890,000 cases reported in the Americas alone in 2007 (2World Health Organization Dengue and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever. World Health Organization, Geneva2009Google Scholar). The C-type lectin-like protein CLEC5A has recently been shown to be a macrophage receptor for dengue virus, and the CLEC5A-virus interaction triggers macrophage activation with a marked proinflammatory cytokine release (3Chen S.T. Lin Y.L. Huang M.T. Wu M.F. Cheng S.C. Lei H.Y. Lee C.K. Chiou T.W. Wong C.H. Hsieh S.L. Nature. 2008; 453: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). CLEC5A contributes substantially to the mortality associated with dengue virus-induced infection by triggering excessive macrophage activation (3Chen S.T. Lin Y.L. Huang M.T. Wu M.F. Cheng S.C.

Blockade of CLEC5A improves survival and shows promise as a therapeutic approach in dengue virus disease (3Chen S.T. Lin Y.L. Huang M.T. Wu M.F. Cheng S.C. Lei H.Y. Lee C.K. Chiou T.W. Wong C.H. Hsieh S.L. Nature. 2008; 453: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). CLEC5A is expressed on the surface of monocytes and macrophages and was identified by its interaction with DNAX-activating protein of molecular mass 12 kilodaltons (DAP12) 3The abbreviations used are: DAPDNAX-activating proteinBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferBRETeffBRET efficiencyEenvelope. ; it is also known as myeloid DAP12-associated lectin (MDL-1) (4Bakker A.B. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). CLEC5A contains a C-type lectin-like domain in its C-terminal extracellular region and has only four amino acids in its predicted N-terminal cytoplasmic region. Signal transmission occurs through the interaction with DAP12, which has a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (4Bakker A.B. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L.

Immunol. 2001; 209: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The CLEC5A-DAP12 interaction depends upon a charge-charge interaction between a lysine residue and an aspartate residue in the transmembrane domains of CLEC5A and DAP12, respectively (4Bakker A.B.

Immunol. 2002; 38: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ligand binding by CLEC5A induces the phosphorylation of DAP12 by Src kinases and an interaction with Syk, which triggers further downstream signaling events (6Gingras M.C. Lapillonne H. Margolin J.F. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). CLEC5A has been shown to associate with both DAP12 and DAP10 in bone marrow-derived osteoclasts, triggering osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling (7Inui M. Kikuchi Y. Aoki N. Endo S. Maeda T.

CLEC5A plays an important role in the activation of macrophages; CLEC5A stimulation of mouse myeloid cells up-regulates expression of the inflammatory mediator CD11b, inducing significant chemokine production and concurrent signaling through Toll-like receptors (4Bakker A.B.

Kobayashi H. Sato K. Tateno M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2009; 85: 508-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both human and mouse CLEC5A have been reported to bind to dengue virions, and the interaction is inhibited in vitro by fucose and mannan (3Chen S.T. Lin Y.L. Huang M.T. Wu M.F. Cheng S.C. Lei H.Y. Lee C.K. Chiou T.W. Wong C.H. Hsieh S.L. Nature. 2008; 453: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, the precise ligand on the virions bound by CLEC5A has not yet been identified. To better understand how host immune cells interact with dengue virus and to explore the role of CLEC5A in dengue virus-induced lethal disease, we have solved the crystal structure of the extracellular, C-type lectin-like domain of CLEC5A and undertaken functional and computational analyses. We examined the binding of CLEC5A to different serotypes of dengue virus and investigated carbohydrate binding to the protein using glycan microarrays and computational docking experiments to map putative ligand binding sites on the structure. These studies demonstrate that CLEC5A is a dimer capable of undergoing a clear conformational switch, which may occur in the presence of a ligand. CLEC5A is capable of binding the different serotypes of dengue virus, although the precise ligand is not known. Collectively, these findings suggest a model whereby a conformational switch may mediate downstream signaling through DAP12, ultimately causing cytokine release and stimulating an inflammatory response. Recombinant human CLEC5A protein constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified by size exclusion chromatography as described previously (9Watson A.A. O'Callaghan C.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 29-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Protein purity and molecular weight were assessed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectroscopy, respectively. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry was performed using a reversed-phase C4 column on an Ultima HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) connected to a quadrupole time-of-flight Micromass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA). For microarray analyses, BirA enzyme was produced and used to biotinylate CLEC5A protein, which had a BirA recognition tag engineered onto its N terminus using the approach described previously (10O'Callaghan C.A. Byford M.F. Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Jakobsen B.K. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Biotinylated CLEC5A protein was conjugated to FITC-labeled neutravidin (Sigma) or Alexa Fluor 647-labeled streptavidin (Invitrogen). Recombinant CLEC5A lacking an N-terminal BirA recognition sequence was crystallized as reported (9Watson A.A. O'Callaghan C.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 29-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The structure of CLEC5A was solved from a twinned crystal with twin fractions of 0.79 and 0.21 using a multistep molecular replacement protocol (see supplemental data) using the program MOLREP and human CD94 (Protein Data Bank code 3BDW) as a search model (11Vagin A.

Subsequent manual rebuilding and refinement cycles used Coot and Refmac5, and the twin refinement function of Refmac was used (13Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The structure of CLEC5A was subjected to validation using the programs PROCHECK and WHATIF before Protein Data Bank deposition under code 2YHF (15Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 16Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8 (29): 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). The Dynamite package was used to infer, analyze, and graphically represent the likely modes of motion of CLEC5A (17Barrett C.P. Hall B.A. Noble M.E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2280-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Electrostatic surface potentials and isocontour representations were calculated using Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) software scaled between −5 and +5, −7 and +7, or −10 and +10 kTe, and images were created using Visual Molecular Dynamics and PyMol (Schrödinger, Portland, OR) and rendered with Raster3D (18Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (27-28): 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39889) Google Scholar). The model of dimeric CLEC5A was assembled by manual superimposition of two copies of the structure of monomeric CLEC5A onto the dimeric structure of the related C-type lectin-like receptor NKG2D (Protein Data Bank code 1KCG) using Coot. Subsequent energy minimization was performed using algorithms implemented by the WHATIF server (16Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8 (29): 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the transmembrane helices of these proteins were performed following the approach described by Psachoulia et al. (19Psachoulia E. Fowler P.W. Bond P.J. Sansom M.S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10503-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, simulations were set up with helices preinserted into a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer and separated from one another. Simulations lasted 5 μs, and the helices were allowed to freely diffuse through the bilayer and interact with one another. Simulations were performed with Gromacs 4 at 323 K. Temperature and pressure were coupled using a Berendsen thermostat (tau_p = 10 ps and tau_t = 1 ps). Pressure was coupled semi-isotropically with a compressibility of 3 × 10−5 bar−1. The force field used was the same derivative of the MARTINI force field used by Psachoulia et al. (19Psachoulia E. Fowler P.W. Bond P.J. Sansom M.S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10503-10512Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Each simulation was repeated five times with different starting velocities. HEK 293T cells were washed in cold PBS and incubated with either mouse anti-CLEC5A antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or the appropriate isotype control for 20 min on ice in PBS, 0.5% FCS. Cells were then washed three times and incubated with an allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody for 20 min on ice. Cells were then washed and analyzed on a FACSCanto machine (BD Biosciences) and subsequently with FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR). For confocal microscopy, HEK 293T cells were grown on glass-bottomed dishes suitable for live cell microscopy (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and imaged 24 h following transfection. A 488 nm argon laser was used to excite fluorophores, and live cells were visualized under an oil-immersed objective with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope and a Zeiss XL3 live cell incubator system (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Munich, Germany). 60% confluent HEK 293T cells were transfected with varying ratios of plasmids encoding full-length human CLEC5A protein tagged at its cytoplasmic N terminus with either green fluorescent protein 2 (GFP2) or luciferase together with either an empty pcDNA3 plasmid or one encoding full-length DAP12 using GeneJuice (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ). These CLEC5A fusion proteins contain the CLEC-2 cytoplasmic domain (residues 1–32) in place of the very short CLEC5A cytoplasmic domain (residues 1–4). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. For each transfection, 10 μm DeepBlueC coelenterazine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to 100 μl of cells in a 96-well plate, and light emission in the 410 ± 40- and 515 ± 15-nm wavelength ranges was collected immediately as described previously using a Fusion microplate analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (20James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). GFP2 and luciferase expression was measured in a separate well and converted to a ratio of concentrations. BRET efficiency (BRETeff) and GFP:luciferase ratio values were calculated by comparison with those obtained for a positive BRET control consisting of a soluble, fused form of luciferase and GFP, which were taken as 1 and 1:1, respectively. CLEC5A or CLEC-2 protein samples were spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS and then incubated with supernatants from UV light-treated dengue virus serotype DEN1 (Hawaii), DEN2 (16681), DEN3 (H87), DEN4 (H241), or mock-infected C6/36 cells for 2 h. After washing three times with PBS, anti-dengue virus mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 4G2, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Bangkok, Thailand) was added to the membrane and incubated for an additional hour followed by a secondary HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at a 1:1000 dilution. After washing, the membranes were developed with enhancement chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare). Recombinant CLEC-2 protein was used as a negative control and was prepared as reported previously (21Watson A.A. O'Callaghan C.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 1094-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Watson A.A. Brown J. Harlos K. Eble J.A. Walter T.S. O'Callaghan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3165-3172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Human anti-dengue virus antibody was purified from hyperimmune serum. The assay was repeated four times. Recombinant CLEC5A protein was tested for its capacity to bind to a wide range of glycan sequences displayed on two different microarray systems as described in detail in the supplemental data. The software GOLD, a program for calculating the docking modes of molecules in protein binding sites, was used to predict the binding of the putative carbohydrate ligands to the crystal structure of CLEC5A (23Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 24Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). The carbohydrates included the monosaccharides fucose and mannose and the N-glycan core tetrasaccharide (α1,6-fucosylated chitobiose core with a mannose residue), which was used in modeling of the core region of the insect N-glycans visualized in the crystal structure of the dengue virus serotype 2 envelope (E) protein dimer (Protein Data Bank code 1OAN) (25Modis Y. Ogata S. Clements D. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6986-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein encoding the extracellular domain of human CLEC5A (Fig. 1A) was purified and crystallized (9Watson A.A. O'Callaghan C.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 29-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Crystals with maximum dimensions of 0.63 mm diffracted synchrotron radiation to 1.9-Å resolution (Table 1). These crystals exhibited partial merohedral twinning with twin fractions of 0.79 and 0.21 and were additionally found to possess a non-crystallographic symmetry axis aligned with the twin axis (see supplemental data). Therefore, a multistep molecular replacement approach was used to assign the precise three-dimensional structure of CLEC5A from these pseudosymmetric crystals. There are nine copies of CLEC5A within the asymmetric unit, representing a range of structural conformers and so providing a valuable insight into the range of possible conformations that this receptor may adopt in vivo.TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection for CLEC5AData collectionSpace groupP31Cell dimensionsa = 109.109, b = 109.109, c = 84.879, α = β = 90.000, γ = 120Wavelength (Å)1.117Resolution (Å)50.00-1.90 (1.97-1.90)Rmerge0.072 (0.495)I/σ(I)12.90 (1.63)Completeness (%)87.1 (76.4)Twin operators, twin fractionh, k, l, 0.79; −h, h + k, −l, 0.21RefinementResolution (Å)50.00-1.90No. protein atoms8560No. solvent atoms1134Average B-factor (Å2)22.408r.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)0.01r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)0.947Rcryst/Rfree0.216/0.267Ramachandran analysisFavored (%)92.91Allowed (%)6.32Outliers (%)0.77 Open table in a new tab The overall architecture of CLEC5A is that of a C-type lectin-like molecule based on two core antiparallel β-sheets flanked by two α-helices. Typically, the long loop region of these proteins plays a key role in ligand binding (22Watson A.A. Brown J. Harlos K. Eble J.A. Walter T.S. O'Callaghan C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3165-3172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Dimasi N. Moretta L. Biassoni R. Immunol. Res. 2004; 30: 95-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E. Proteins. 2003; 52: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The CLEC5A long loop is unusual in two respects. First, of the 20 loop residues, 10 are glutamines or asparagines (Fig. 1A). Regions of high glutamine/asparagine content often act as molecular polar zippers, influencing ligand binding. Such polar zipper regions influence the interactions between hemoglobin subunits and between several transcription factors and specific DNA segments (28Perutz M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Second and most significantly, two different long loop region conformations exist in the crystal. In four of the nine CLEC5A molecules within the asymmetric unit, the long loop region contains an extra β-strand, which is positioned such that it forms an extension of the antiparallel β-sheet beneath it, thus simultaneously reducing loop flexibility and stabilizing the protein core (Fig. 1, B–D, molecule A). However, in the remaining molecules (Fig. 1, B–D, molecule E), this section is disordered, suggesting that in the absence of a stabilizing crystal lattice ligand binding may promote a conformational switch between these two states. This arrangement has not been documented hitherto for members of this family of proteins. Although the long loop regions of related molecules NKG2D and LOX-1 also contain short, β-strand-like elements, these features are considerably smaller than the CLEC5A long loop region β-strand and do not form part of a greater β-sheet assembly; in contrast, the CLEC-2 long loop region contains a short 310 helix (22Watson A.A.

Tsuchiya D. Machida S. Morikawa K. Tate S. Structure. 2005; 13: 905-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, this β-sheet can potentially function as a “tether,” attenuating the flexibility of the long loop region at its N terminus, and as an enhanced internal scaffold, imparting greater central stability to CLEC5A. This raises the likelihood that CLEC5A has substantial potential dynamic flexibility compared with related molecules and is capable of undergoing a conformational change on binding to a ligand at the cell surface. As is typical of C-type lectin-like proteins, the core of CLEC5A is maintained by three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Non-covalent mechanisms also contribute to the core stability of CLEC5A with three internal hydrophobic centers drawing together the secondary structural elements of the C-type lectin-like domain (Fig. 1E). These hydrophobic cores play an important role in the internal stability of CLEC5A through adhesive interactions between the delocalized electrons of aromatic rings. To explore the possible roles of these structural features of CLEC5A in ligand binding and subsequent signal transduction, we performed computational dynamics analyses of the crystal structural data. The analyses incorporated information from all of the nine structural conformers present in the unit cell. A covariance web for CLEC5A indicates the presence of three distinct structural subdomains, which appear to move independently from one another, centering on the unique third β-sheet as a fulcrum (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, a porcupine plot reveals that the “distal” and “proximal” portions of CLEC5A (defined in terms of relative distance from the cell membrane) are predicted to be capable of moving in opposing, twisting motions around a rigid, central core (Fig. 2B). Although it is unclear how this putative twisting motion might affect the ligand binding capabilities of CLEC5A, such twisting may influence downstream signaling via the adapter molecule DAP12. A twisting motion in the extracellular domain of a membrane protein can result in a change in the orientation of a transmembrane helix in terms of its tilt angle and/or rotation; this is well demonstrated for the Tar chemoreceptor of E. coli (31Moore J.O. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 2009; 17: 1195-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such a change in the CLEC5A transmembrane helix could bring the CLEC5A and DAP12 pairs of charged residues into closer proximity, which may influence subsequent signaling through the activating motifs of DAP12. This may occur by reciprocal twisting of the signaling region into a more accessible position perhaps less sterically inhibited by the membrane. Many C-type lectin-like molecules bind their ligands as dimers (26Dimasi N. Moretta L. Biassoni R. Immunol. Res. 2004; 30: 95-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Radaev S. Rostro B. Brooks A.G.

Additionally, all DAP12-associated C-type lectin-like molecules are dimeric (34Feng J. Call M.E. Wucherpfennig K.W. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e142Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CLEC5A crystallized as a monomer, and the site on its surface equivalent to the homodimerization site of many C-type lectin-like proteins does not possess a surface distribution of hydrophobic patches sufficient to dictate constitutive dimerization as observed in some family members, such as the immune receptor NKG2D and members of the Ly49 receptor family (26Dimasi N. Moretta L. Biassoni R. Immunol. Res. 2004; 30: 95-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Radaev S. Rostro B. Brooks A.G. Colonna M. Sun P.D. Immunity. 2001; 15: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, we have recently shown that the related receptor CLEC-2, which similarly lacks a prominent “dimerization patch,” does indeed form dimers in the plasma membrane, and this dimerization is central to its function (32Watson A.A. Christou C.M. James J.R. Fenton-May A.E. Moncayo G.E. Mistry A.R. Davis S.J. Gilbert R.J. Chakera A. O'Callaghan C.A. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 10988-10996Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This and the homodimeric nature of DAP12 prompted us to investigate whether CLEC5A can similarly homodimerize in the membrane. BRET assays determine the BRETeff between luciferase (a light donor) and GFP2 (a light acceptor) fusion proteins. As this efficiency depends upon the distance between the donor and acceptor, this provides a quantitative method for distinguishing between monomers and dimers at the cell surface (20James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently cotransfected with a “BRET pair” of plasmids encoding full-length CLEC5A (one tagged with GFP2 and the other tagged with luciferase) and with either an empty control vector or one expressing DAP12 (see supplemental data). Surface expression of these CLEC5A constructs was confirmed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3, A–C). Quantitative analysis of this type 1 BRET data demonstrates that CLEC5A oligomerizes in the absence and presence of DAP12, and the dependence of BRETeff on the acceptor:donor ratio fits best to a dimer model (Fig. 3D). The BRETeff maxima for the CLEC5A BRET pairs reside between the documented BRETeff maxima for known monomers and for disulfide-linked homodimers, and the curve shape is typical of nonconstitutive homodimerization (20James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These curves resemble those we previously reported for the nonconstitutive homodimer and related C-type lectin-like protein CLEC-2 and indicate that human CLEC5A homodimerizes at the cell surface and that this dimerization occurs independently of DAP12 (20James J.R. Oliveira M.I. Carmo A.M. Iaboni A. Davis S.J. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 32Watson A.A. Christou C.M. James J.R. Fenton-May A.E. Moncayo G.E.

A model of dimeric CLEC5A based on the CLEC5A crystal structure and standard dimerization arrangement for related molecules (Fig. 3E) indicates that there will be a large potential binding surface area for ligand interactions.

https://openalex.org/W1974564737,"TSG-6 (TNF-α-stimulated gene/protein 6), a hyaluronan (HA)-binding protein, has been implicated in the negative regulation of inflammatory tissue destruction. However, little is known about the tissue/cell-specific expression of TSG-6 in inflammatory processes, due to the lack of appropriate reagents for the detection of this protein in vivo. Here, we report on the development of a highly sensitive detection system and its use in cartilage proteoglycan (aggrecan)-induced arthritis, an autoimmune murine model of rheumatoid arthritis. We found significant correlation between serum concentrations of TSG-6 and arthritis severity throughout the disease process, making TSG-6 a better biomarker of inflammation than any of the other arthritis-related cytokines measured in this study. TSG-6 was present in arthritic joint tissue extracts together with the heavy chains of inter-α-inhibitor (IαI). Whereas TSG-6 was broadly detectable in arthritic synovial tissue, the highest level of TSG-6 was co-localized with tryptases in the heparin-containing secretory granules of mast cells. In vitro, TSG-6 formed complexes with the tryptases murine mast cell protease-6 and -7 via either heparin or HA. In vivo TSG-6-tryptase association could also be detected in arthritic joint extracts by co-immunoprecipitation. TSG-6 has been reported to suppress inflammatory tissue destruction by enhancing the serine protease-inhibitory activity of IαI against plasmin. TSG-6 achieves this by transferring heavy chains from IαI to HA, thus liberating the active bikunin subunit of IαI. Because bikunin is also present in mast cell granules, we propose that TSG-6 can promote inhibition of tryptase activity via a mechanism similar to inhibition of plasmin."
https://openalex.org/W2133933234,"Using a high-sensitivity torsional oscillator technique, we mapped the rotational and relaxational dynamics of solid helium-4 throughout the parameter range of the proposed supersolidity. We found evidence that the same microscopic excitations controlling the torsional oscillator motions are generated independently by thermal and mechanical stimulation. Moreover, a measure for the relaxation times of these excitations diverges smoothly without any indication for a critical temperature or critical velocity of a supersolid transition. Finally, we demonstrated that the combined temperature-velocity dependence of the TO response is indistinguishable from the combined temperature-strain dependence of the solid's shear modulus. This implies that the rotational responses of solid helium-4 attributed to supersolidity are associated with generation of the same microscopic excitations as those produced by direct shear strain."

https://openalex.org/W2168511716,"The molecular basis of ligand binding and activation of family B G protein-coupled receptors is not yet clear due to the lack of insight into the structure of intact receptors. Although NMR and crystal structures of amino-terminal domains of several family members support consistency in general structural motifs that include a peptide-binding cleft, there are variations in the details of docking of the carboxyl terminus of peptide ligands within this cleft, and there is no information about siting of the amino terminus of these peptides. There are also no empirical data to orient the receptor amino terminus relative to the core helical bundle domain. Here, we prepared a series of five new probes, incorporating photolabile moieties into positions 2, 15, 20, 24, and 25 of full agonist secretin analogues. Each bound specifically to the receptor and covalently labeled single distinct receptor residues. Peptide mapping of labeled wild-type and mutant receptors identified that the position 15, 20, and 25 probes labeled residues within the distal amino terminus of the receptor, whereas the position 24 probe labeled the amino terminus adjacent to TM1. Of note, the position 2 probe labeled a residue within the first extracellular loop of the receptor, a region not previously labeled, providing an important new constraint for docking the amino-terminal region of secretin to its receptor core. These additional experimentally derived constraints help to refine our understanding of the structure of the secretin-intact receptor complex and provide new insights into understanding the molecular mechanism for activation of family B G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2135631930,"The parasitic protozoa Leishmania major produces a peroxidase (L. major peroxidase; LmP) that exhibits activities characteristic of both yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) and plant cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (APX). One common feature is a key Trp residue, Trp208 in LmP and Trp191 in CCP, that is situated adjacent to the proximal His heme ligand in CCP, APX, and LmP. In CCP, Trp191 forms a stable cationic radical after reaction with H2O2 to form Compound I; in APX, the radical is located on the porphyrin ring. In order to clarify the role of Trp208 in LmP and to further probe peroxidase structure-function relationships, we have determined the crystal structure of LmP and have studied the role of Trp208 using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), mutagenesis, and enzyme kinetics. Both CCP and LmP have an extended section of β structure near Trp191 and Trp208, respectively, which is absent in APX. This region provides stability to the Trp191 radical in CCP. EPR of LmP Compound I exhibits an intense and stable signal similar to CCP Compound I. In the LmP W208F mutant, this signal disappears, indicating that Trp208 forms a stable cationic radical. In LmP conversion of the Cys197 to Thr significantly weakens the Compound I EPR signal and dramatically lowers enzyme activity. These results further support the view that modulation of the local electrostatic environment controls the stability of the Trp radical in peroxidases.

Heme peroxidases are found in many organisms and utilize peroxides to oxidize a variety of physiologically important molecules (1Dunford H.B. Peroxidases and Catalases: Biochemistry, Biophysics, Biotechnology, and Physiology. 2nd Ed. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2010Google Scholar). Because these enzymes are robust and form spectroscopically visible and stable intermediates, heme peroxidases have proven to be a model system to probe structure-function relationships in heme proteins. The general heme peroxidase mechanism is outlined below. Fe(III)R+H2O2→Fe(IV)-OR+˙+H2OCOMPOUND I Fe(IV)-OR+˙+S→Fe(IV)-OR+S⋅COMPOUND II Fe(IV)-OR+S→Fe(III)R+H2O+S⋅SCHEME I Upon the addition of an equimolar amount of H2O2, the enzyme forms the stable intermediate termed Compound I. H2O2 is heterolytically cleaved, releasing a water molecule while the second peroxide-derived oxygen atom remains coordinated to the heme iron. The iron-linked oxygen atom with only six valence electrons oxidizes the heme iron to Fe(IV) and a nearby organic moiety to a cationic radical. The enzyme returns to the resting state upon two successive electron transfer events from two individual reducing substrate molecules (S in the above scheme), forming the second water that remains in the active site of the resting enzyme. For most heme peroxidases, R is the porphyrin ring. In the case of cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP), 2The abbreviations used are: CCPcytochrome c peroxidaseAPXascorbate peroxidaseSADsingle wavelength anomalous dispersionLmPL. major peroxidase. however, R is an amino acid residue, Trp191, located in the proximal pocket directly adjacent to the proximal His heme ligand (2Sivaraja M.

CCP is also the only well characterized peroxidase that utilizes another protein, cytochrome c, as a reducing substrate. cytochrome c peroxidase ascorbate peroxidase single wavelength anomalous dispersion L. major peroxidase. These unique mechanistic features of CCP have prompted many investigations probing the relationship between structure and function in heme peroxidases. Structurally, all heme peroxidases have a highly conserved 10-α-helical bundle with sequence identities ranging from ∼16 to 50% (3Gajhede M. Schuller D.J. Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) and very similar active site architectures. The initial crystal structures and sequence alignments provided reasonable explanations for why CCP forms a Trp radical and not a porphyrin radical. A large majority of heme peroxidases have a Phe at the analogous position of Trp191 in CCP, and because the indole side chain is easier to oxidize than the phenyl side chain, it was postulated that the CCP Trp is preferentially oxidized. This hypothesis was disproved after electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments illustrated that cytosolic pea ascorbate peroxidase (APX) forms a heme porphyrin radical despite APX maintaining proximal Trp (4Patterson W.R. Poulos T.L. Goodin D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4342-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These unexpected results with APX led to numerous studies that clearly illustrated that stabilization of the Trp191 cation radical is dependent upon the surrounding electrostatic environment (5Barrows T.P.

One obvious difference between CCP and APX is the K+ ion (Ca2+ in other peroxidases) in APX that is located about 8.5 Å from the proximal Trp and is, therefore, in position to electrostatically destabilize the positive charge on the cationic Trp radical. CCP lacks the K+ and instead binds a water molecule at this location. Our group has shown that engineering the APX K+ site into CCP destabilizes the Trp191 radical in a cationic concentration-dependent manner and decreases activity to about ∼0.02% of wild type levels (5Barrows T.P. Bhaskar B. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8826-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Bonagura C.A. Sundaramoorthy M. Bhaskar B. Poulos T.L.

Other studies illustrated that the electronegative amino acids unique to CCP, Met230 and Met231, near Trp191 are also important for stabilization of the Trp radical (5Barrows T.P. Bhaskar B.

A recently characterized peroxidase from Leishmania major, LmP, was reported to be a naturally occurring hybrid, a putative “missing link” of heme peroxidases, because it exhibits sequence homology and enzyme activities characteristic of both APX and CCP (13Adak S. Datta A.K. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This peroxidase has been designated LmAPX due to its initial designation as an ascorbate peroxidase, but as will become evident further on, we will refer to the L. major peroxidase as LmP. LmP conserves not only the proximal Trp (Trp208) but also the two Met (positions 248 and 249) residues known to help stabilize the Trp191 radical in CCP (Met230 and Met231), leading us to hypothesize that LmP might be the first well characterized peroxidase to mechanistically mimic CCP (13Adak S. Datta A.K. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Yadav R.K. Dolai S. Pal S. Adak S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 495: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We therefore have solved the crystal structure of LmP and employed EPR spectroscopy, enzyme kinetics, and mutagenesis to determine the location of the cationic radical in LmP Compound I. LmP was expressed without the hydrophobic N-terminal tail, as Δ34LmP. The construct was generously supplied by Dr. Subrata Adak (13Adak S. Datta A.K. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Δ34LmP was inserted into the pPAL7 (Bio-Rad) vector using the Infusion® Dry-Down PCR cloning kit. The primers were designed to conserve the SpeI and NotI restriction sites in the pPAL7 vector and therefore code for two extra amino acids on the N terminus of Δ34LmP, Thr and Ser. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon®: forward primer (SpeI), 5′-G CTC TTC AAA GCT TTG ACT AGT GAG GAG CCG CCG TTC-3′ and reverse primer (NotI), 5′ CGG GCT TAT GCG GCC GCT TAG CTC TCC GAA GCG-3′. Successful insertion was first verified with double digests using SpeI and NotI, followed by sequencing. All mutants in this paper were prepared using the Stratagene® Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit; and all mutagenic oligonucleotides, forward and reverse complement, were also obtained through Operon®. The forward mutagenic primers for Δ34LmP C197T and Δ34LmP W208F were 5′-GCG CAC ACA TGC GGT GAG ACC CAC ATC GAA TTC TCC GGC-3′ and 5′-GGC TAC CAT GGG CCG TTC ACA CAC GAC AAG AAC-3. CCPK1 is a CCP mutant that has been engineered to bind K+ at the same location as the K+ site in APX and LmP (7Bonagura C.A. Sundaramoorthy M. Pappa H.S. Patterson W.R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6107-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CCPK1/T180C was prepared in the same manner, using the CCPK1 mutagenic construct from our earlier studies (7Bonagura C.A. Sundaramoorthy M. Pappa H.S. Patterson W.R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6107-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The forward mutagenic oligonucleotide was 5′-GGG GCT CAC ACC CTG GGC AAG TGC CAC TTG AAG AAC TCT GGA TAC G-3′. Mutagenesis was confirmed with sequencing. The pPAL7/LmP plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and plated onto minimal media agar with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). One colony was picked and grown in LB containing 0.5% glucose, to repress leaky expression, and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) overnight at 37 °C and 220 rpm agitation. Expression cultures of TB media with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were inoculated with the overnight culture (1:100). The cells were grown at 37 °C with agitation of 220 rpm in a New Brunswick® Scientific C25KC incubator. When the culture reached an A600 of 0.8, the temperature was dropped to 25 °C, and agitation was decreased to 100 rpm. Induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was found to be unnecessary because it caused a greater level of insoluble protein. The cells were harvested by centrifugation after 18 h of growth and stored at −80 °C. The cells were thawed and resuspended by stirring for 1 h at 4 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 150 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm l-ascorbic acid, 25 μm magnesium acetate, 100 μg/ml lysozyme, 0.2 μg/ml DNase, and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin. Sonication on ice for 2 min ensured efficient lysis. The soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 37,500 × g, 4 °C for 1 h; the lysate was loaded onto a 10-ml Profinity eXact (Bio-Rad) gravity column that had been pre-equilibrated with 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol at a rate of 2 ml/min at 4 °C. The column then was washed with 10 column volumes of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, followed by 10 column volumes of 300 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol. The column was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 column volume of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 100 mm sodium fluoride. The protein was eluted with the same buffer the following day at room temperature. The eluted protein was then concentrated in a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Amicon® concentrator at 4 °C and then loaded onto a Superdex 75 16/60 column that had been pre-equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, 5% glycerol at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at 4 °C. The resulting chromatogram exhibited three peaks. Active LmP elutes in the second peak as determined by the spectroscopic formation of Compound I upon equimolar addition of hydrogen peroxide. Sample homogeneity was determined by SDS-PAGE. Fractions with an Rz (A408/A280) of ≥1.2 were pooled and concentrated to at least 30 mg/ml. The C197T and W208F mutants were expressed and purified in the same manner. The protein concentration of LmP was calculated with the molar extinction coefficient, ∈280 = 74.3 mm−1 cm−1, determined using the Pierce® modified Lowry protein assay kit. The same kit was used to determine the molar extinction coefficients of the mutants, W208F ∈280 = 70.4 mm−1 cm−1 and C197T ∈280 = 69.2 mm−1 cm−1. The heme content of LmP and both mutants was between 95.6 and 99.7%. A slightly modified hemochromagen assay (15Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), 20% pyridine and 0.2 m NaOH, was used to determine heme content and these Soret molar extinction coefficients: LmP ∈408 = 113.6 mm−1 cm−1, C197T ∈408 = 104.3 mm−1 cm−1 and W208F ∈410 = 108 mm−1 cm−1. Purified protein was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. CCP, CCPK1, and CCPK1/T180C were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described previously by Fishel et al. (12Fishel L.A. Farnum M.F. Mauro J.M. Miller M.A. Kraut J. Liu Y.J. Tan X.L. Scholes C.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1986-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and Meharenna et al.

However, after the heme incorporation, both the CCP and CCPK1 were eluted from the DEAE column using a gradient of 20–500 mm potassium phosphate pH 6, whereas the CCPK1/T180C was eluted with 500 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0. Spectrophotometric steady-state activity assays using both reduced horse heart cytochrome c and l-ascorbic acid as substrates were performed at room temperature using a Cary 3E UV-visible spectrophotometer. The assays were carried out in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, which had been filtered with a 0.2-μm sterile filter unit. The pH for CCP and the CCP mutants was 6.0, whereas the pH for LmP and its mutants was 7.0. Attempts to dialyze wild type and mutant LmP against a pH 6.0 buffer resulted in protein precipitating out of solution. Horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma) was dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm sodium dithionite and incubated on ice for 30 min. Dithionite was removed by gel filtration over a disposable PD-10 column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The concentration of reduced horse heart cytochrome c was determined using the molar extinction coefficient, ∈550 = 27.6 mm−1 cm−1, and the steady-state oxidation of reduced horse heart cytochrome c was calculated using Δ∈550 = 19.6 mm−1 cm−1 (16Margoliash E.

The reaction was initiated by the addition of hydrogen peroxide and monitored for 30 s. l-Ascorbic acid was dissolved in water, and the concentration was determined using ∈265 = 14.5 mm−1 cm−1 (20Buettner G.R. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1988; 16: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Final reaction conditions for ascorbate oxidation activity assays were as follows: LmP, 585 nm; CCP, 766 nm; C197T, 621 nm; W208F, 600 nm; CCPK1, 627 nm; and CCPK1/T180C, 521 nm with 0.1 mm ascorbate and 0.3 mm hydrogen peroxide. The addition of hydrogen peroxide initiated the reactions, which were monitored at 290 nm (∈290 = 2.8 mm−1cm−1) over 1 min (21Nakano Y. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1981; 22: 867-880Google Scholar, 22Nakano Y. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 131-140Google Scholar). All LmP enzyme concentrations were determined using the Soret molar extinction coefficients reported in this paper, and the molar extinction coefficient used for CCP was ∈408 = 93 mm−1 cm−1, and that used for CCPK1 and CCPK1/T180C was ∈408 = 96 mm−1 cm−1 (7Bonagura C.A.

CCP, CCPK1, and CCPK1/T180C were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, and LmP C197T and W208F were dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, which had been filtered sterile, at 4 °C, overnight. Enzyme concentrations were determined using the Soret molar extinction coefficients. Compound I EPR samples were prepared by combining equal volumes of 0.3 mm enzyme with 0.36 mm of hydrogen peroxide to total 0.3 ml. The sample was immediately transferred to an EPR tube and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen; this process took no more than 3 min for each sample. After the initial EPR spectra were collected at 7 K, each sample was concurrently removed from a cryo-Dewar and allowed to sit at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were simultaneously refrozen in liquid nitrogen and again subjected to EPR at 7 K. All spectra were standardized against a 1,1 diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, g = 2.0036 (23Yordanov N.D. Appl. Magn. Reson. 1996; 10: 339-350Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Yordanov N.D. Christova A. Appl. Magn. Reson. 1994; 6: 341-345Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). EPR settings were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.387 GHz; modulation amplitude, 0.40 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; field sweep rate, 23.84 G/s; microwave power, 0.638 milliwatt; receiver gain, 1.0 × 104; and time constant, 5.120 ms. The precrystallization test (Hampton) was used to determine the most promising range of protein concentrations, 5–7 mg/ml, for the initial screenings of LmP. Various commercial crystallization kits were used to set up hanging drop vapor diffusion trays with a high throughput nanoliter dispensing robot, the Mosquito®. LmP crystallized in a variety of conditions, the precipitant usually being PEG 3350. All crystallization reagents were filtered sterile (0.2 μm). Diffraction quality crystals were grown overnight using sitting drop vapor diffusion trays at room temperature. An equal volume, usually 2 μl, of 6 mg/ml LmP in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol was combined with the crystallization solution, 0.2 m potassium chloride, 16% PEG 3350, and 2.5–5% glycerol. In an attempt to obtain the ascorbate-bound structure, we soaked these crystals in cryo (well solution plus 20% glycerol) containing 0.5 and 1 mm ascorbic acid. The crystals, however, began to melt immediately upon introduction of this substrate. Nevertheless, LmP co-crystallized in the presence of ascorbic acid; 2 μl of 9 mg/ml LmP was combined with an equal volume of 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 3.0% tacsimate, pH 7.0, 5 mm l-ascorbic acid, 20% PEG 3350, and 5–12.5% glycerol. These crystals were grown using sitting drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C and would not grow without l-ascorbic acid. C197T crystals were obtained by using hanging drop trays and combining an equal volume of 7 mg/ml C197T with the reservoir solution of 0.1–0.12 m potassium chloride, 7.5–11.5 mm calcium chloride, 12% glycerol, and 18% PEG 3350. All cryoprotectants were identical to the specific crystallization solutions and included a final concentration of 20% glycerol. LmP crystals diffracted to 1.76 Å resolution and belong to space group P212121 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. Data for LmP were collected at SSRL beamline 7-1. The LmP structure was solved by combining phase information from molecular replacement and single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) at the iron absorption edge. The SAD data were collected at 1.7 Å x-ray wavelength using an inverse beam protocol. High resolution data were also collected with a different crystal at 0.97 Å wavelength in two scans; in the low resolution scan, 100 frames were collected with 5-s exposure and 1° oscillation per frame, and in the high resolution scan, 200 frames were collected with 25-s exposure and 0.5° oscillation per frame. The data for each scan were indexed and integrated separately and scaled together using HKL-2000 software (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. Pt. A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). SAD data were also processed using HKL-2000. Molecular replacement calculations were carried out with Phaser (26McCoy A.J. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) through the CCP4i graphic interface (27Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) using cytochrome c peroxidase (Protein Data Bank entry 2CYP) as a search model. Phaser was also used for the SAD phasing calculation. Phases were combined using SigmaA followed by density modification using DM in the CCP4 suite. The resulting electron density was in excellent quality. The structure was then inspected and some surface regions manually rebuilt using COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar, 29Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17674) Google Scholar). Refinement was completed with REFMAC5 (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). LmP crystals grown in the presence of ascorbate diffracted to 1.98 Å and were also in the P212121 space group with two molecules per asymmetric unit. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled in the aforementioned manner; molecular replacement was done with Phaser using substrate-free LmP as the search model. The resulting maps showed no electron density for ascorbate. C197T crystals diffracted to 2.38 Å and were also in the P212121 space group. Two data sets from two separate crystals were collected at SSRL beamline 7-1; the first data set was 200 frames exposed for 25 s/frame, and the second data set was 200 frames exposed for 12 s/frame, both with 0.5° oscillations. Data were indexed and integrated separately and scaled together with HKL-2000. For the initial density calculation, all cations were removed from the LmP model, and Cys197 was mutated into Ala to prevent any bias. After three rounds of refinements, the density continued to clearly exhibit the conserved cation binding sites (density visible up to 13 σ in Fo − Fc maps) and the Thr density at position 197. Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table 1, where all Rfree values are calculated with 5% of the data excluded from refinements.TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsData setLmP native SADLmP native HiRes (PDB code 3RIV)LmP C197T (PDB code 3RIW)Space groupP212121P212121P212121Unit cell dimensions (a, b, c) (Å)46.535, 77.048, 155.64146.600, 77.101, 155.73445.819, 77.766, 160.580Resolution range (Å)50–2.5850–1.7650–2.38Radiation sourceSSRL 7-1SSRL 7-1SSRL 7-1Wavelength (Å)1.70.971.09Total observations141,780278,239186,582Unique reflections (highest shell)33,860 (1,622)56,061 (2,779)23,951 (1,191)Completeness (%) (highest shell)99.9 (97.7)99.9 (100)100 (99.9)Rsym (highest shell)0.06 (0.18)0.074 (0.399)0.097 (0.584)〈I/σ〉 (highest shell)25.05 (6.01)33.22 (2.82)17.15 (3.08)Wilson B factor27.135.5Reflections used in refinement53,05522,558Resolution range (Å) in refinement38.5–1.7635.5–2.38Rwork0.1610.181Rfree0.2090.242 Open table in a new tab The structure of LmP has been solved to 1.76 Å resolution and exhibits the characteristic peroxidase 10 α-helical bundle fold (Fig. 1). The triple β-strand unique to CCP is present in LmP. This structural element is not present in APX. The electron density of LmP shows two cations, a potassium that is visible up to 20 σ in the Fo − Fc difference map and a calcium visible up to 26 σ in the same map (Fig. 2). Given the coordinating amino acids (Table 2) and the electron density, the distal cation is probably a Ca2+, whereas the proximal cation is probably a K+. These cations are conserved among the majority of heme peroxidases except CCP, which has no cations, and APX, which conserves only the proximal Na+/K+. The presence or absence of the K+ ion is critically important for stabilization of the Trp191 cationic radical in CCP Compound I. The mechanism of stabilization is electrostatic. When Trp191 is converted to a Gly, thus creating a proximal pocket cavity, the cavity can be filled with small molecules with a strong preference for positively charged imidazoles (8Fitzgerald M.M. Churchill M.J. McRee D.E. Goodin D.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3807-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and monovalent cations (9Miller M.A. Han G.W. Kraut J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 11118-11122Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, computational studies indicate that the Trp191 local environment is designed to stabilize a positive charge (10Jensen G.M. Bunte S.W. Warshel A. Goodin D.B. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 8221-8228Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has engineered the APX K+ binding site into CCP to give the mutant termed CCPK1. The presence of this positive charge so close to Trp191 destabilized the Trp191 cation radical in Compound I, as observed through EPR and significantly reduced cytochrome c peroxidase activity (6Bonagura C.A. Sundaramoorthy M. Bhaskar B. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5538-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Bonagura C.A. Sundaramoorthy M. Pappa H.S. Patterson W.R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6107-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We also showed that Met230 and Met231 are important for stabilization of the cationic Trp191 radical (11Barrows T.P. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14062-14068Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Like CCP, changing the proximal Trp to Phe in LmP greatly decreased the cytochrome c peroxidase activity (31Yadav R.K. Dolai S. Pal S. Adak S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that LmP might also form a Trp radical. This would be inconsistent with the presence of the proximal K+ site in LmP. Therefore, it was important to determine if LmP forms a stable Trp208 radical using EPR spectroscopy.FIGURE 2Calcium and potassium binding coordination in LmP.

IntroductionSortases are cysteine transpeptidases that catalyze covalent anchoring of surface proteins to the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria. Catalytic action of sortase entails a peptide ligation reaction that occurs in two steps and involves an acyl-enzyme intermediate (1Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Science. 1999; 285: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 2Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mazmanian S.K.

Rev. 2006; 70: 192-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The prototypical sortase (SrtA) of Staphylococcus aureus recognizes a pentapeptide LPXTG motif present near the carboxyl terminus of surface proteins, cleaves the scissile T-G peptide bond, and captures the protein as an acyl-enzyme intermediate with the active site cysteine covalently linked to a Thr residue by a thioester bond (5Ton-That H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9876-9881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This acyl-enzyme intermediate is resolved by nucleophilic attack of the α-amino group of a pentaglycine sequence present in peptidoglycan leading to anchoring of proteins to the cell wall (Fig. 1A).Whereas the housekeeping sortases, e.g. SrtA of S. aureus, are responsible for cell wall anchoring of surface proteins, other members of the sortase family, referred to as pilin sortases, carry out covalent assembly of long protein fibers termed pilus (9Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 10Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Trends Microbiol. 2004; 12: 228-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The pilus structure is assembled from pilin subunits. These subunits consist of an LPXTG motif at the C terminus, a pilin motif containing a conserved lysyl residue (WXXXVXVYPKN) at the N terminus, and an E box motif (YXLXETXAPXGY) harboring a conserved glutamyl residue located in the central region of the protein (11Ton-That H. Marraffini L.A. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Scott J.R. Zähner D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 320-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Sortase-mediated pilin polymerization also proceeds via the intermediary of a thioester acyl-enzyme intermediate (Fig. 1B), which is resolved through nucleophilic attack of the ∈-amino group of the lysyl residue (cf. α-amino of pentaglycine for cell wall anchoring) in the pilin motif of another subunit (13Telford J.L. Barocchi M.A. Margarit I. Rappuoli R. Grandi G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 14Guttilla I.K. Gaspar A.H. Swierczynski A. Swaminathan A. Dwivedi P.

Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 33-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The reaction is facilitated by head to tail arrangement of subunits wherein the N-terminal domain of one subunit is abutted against the C-terminal domain of another allowing correct disposition of the critical lysine of the pilin motif in close proximity to the C-terminal LPXTG motif (16Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Clow F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17Kang H.J. Paterson N.G. Gaspar A.H. Ton-That H. Baker E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus sequence specificity as well as proximity of the reacting ends appears to be an important feature of the “isopeptide” ligation reaction catalyzed by pilin sortases.SrtA-mediated peptide ligation reaction can be replicated efficiently in vitro with short LPXTG peptides and oligoglycine (8Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9876-9881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The propensity of SrtA to recognize a simple pentapeptide consensus sequence and a triglycine has inspired the use of this enzyme as a synthetic tool in biological chemistry (19Mao H. Hart S.A.

In contrast, “isopeptide ligation” activity of pilin sortases has not been so far applied to the synthesis of branched polypeptides. This is presumably because recombinant pilin sortases exhibit poor catalytic efficiency in vitro (33Manzano C. Contreras-Martel C. El Mortaji L. Izoré T. Fenel D. Vernet T. Schoehn G. Di Guilmi A.M. Dessen A. Structure. 2008; 16: 1838-1848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The synthetic utility of pilin sortases is further marred by restrictions imposed by stereochemical aspects of the ligation reaction alluded to above. Given the limited synthetic utility of pilin sortases, we turned our attention toward SrtA of S. aureus and explored if this enzyme could accept ∈-amino group of Lys residue in the transpeptidation reaction. We were motivated by the fact that SrtA displays rather relaxed specificity for the amine nucleophile and can accept a variety of molecules, terminating in aminomethyl (H2NCH2-) or aminoethyl (H2NCH2CH2-) moieties, as substitutes for oligoglycines (28Parthasarathy R. Subramanian S. Boder E.T. Bioconjug. Chem. 2007; 18: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31Ito T. Sadamoto R. Naruchi K. Togame H. Takemoto H. Kondo H. Nishimura S.

Our results provide insights about principles governing isopeptide ligation reactions catalyzed by SrtA to produce cyclic and/or branched peptides and suggest that the presence of a long-lived highly stable acyl-enzyme intermediate may be obligatory for facile branching.RESULTSSrtA Catalyzes Intermolecular Transfer of a Model LPXTG Peptide to a Pilin-specific Lys Residue in a Short Peptide SequenceThe process of covalent pilus assembly in Gram-positive bacteria projects a complex mechanism. However, general principles governing the assembly process have emerged in the past couple of years, particularly, from detailed mechanistic studies of pilus formation in Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The importance of the tripartite motif (a pilin motif, an E-box motif, and an LPXTG like sortase-recognition motif) and the identity of specific pilin sortases (distinct from a housekeeping sortase) have been established. It is abundantly clear that pilin sortases cleave the scissile T-G peptide bond in the recognition motif and ligate the threonyl carboxylate to an ∈-amine of a lysyl residue in the pilin motif of another subunit. Some evidence has been provided for the involvement of a Glu residue located in the E-box motif in pilus assembly (9Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is apparent that facile covalent assembly of pilus would require the proximity of the reactive Lys residue in the pilin motif and Thr of the LPXTG sortase-recognition sequence, and the correct positioning of the Glu residue of the E-box motif for providing the needed anchimeric assistance. Notwithstanding the conformational requirements of appropriate stereochemistry and orientation of the topogenic motifs, the specific ∈-amine of the pilin motif must also be endowed with enhanced nucleophilicity. This aspect of the sortase-mediated isopeptide ligation reaction can be tested with short synthetic peptides comprising pilin and the LPXTG motif. Accordingly, peptide sequences representing the pilin motif of the RrgB protein of S. pneumoniae and a model sortase recognition sequence YALPNTGK were chosen for the study. The housekeeping sortase (SrtA) of S. aureus was used keeping in mind the practical synthetic utility of this enzyme.To begin with, a peptide, YPKNTEAKPK (designated P1, see Table 1), comprising residues 181–190 of RrgB was synthesized (9Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Spraggon G. Koesema E. Scarselli M. Malito E. Biagini M. Norais N. Emolo C. Barocchi M.A. Giusti F. Hilleringmann M. Rappuoli R. Lesley S. Covacci A. Masignani V. Ferlenghi I. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This stretch of the sequence was chosen to include the YPK pilin motif as well as to accommodate extra Lys residues at positions 188 and 190 to evaluate the site specificity of the isopeptide ligation reaction. RP-HPLC analyses of a mixture of P1 and YALPNTGK incubated in the presence of SrtA yielded two new peaks (supplemental Fig. S1). ES-MS analysis of the peak 1A gave a mass of 1833.83 Da, which fit to an adduct of YALPNT-YPKNTEAKPK (calculated mass, 1833.96 Da). The mass of peak 1B was found to be 677.31 Da, which corresponded well to the mass of a hydrolyzed peptide (YALPNT, calculated mass: 677.34 Da). Taken together the data suggested that peaks 1 and 2 were transpeptidation and hydrolyzed products, respectively.The transpeptidation product (Peak 1A) was further characterized to delineate the site of peptide ligation. MALDI-TOF spectrum of the V8 protease digest of the transpeptidation product yielded a peptide fragment of m/z 1410.45 (supplemental Fig. S2A), which corresponded to the m/z of the peptide adduct YALPNT-YPKNTE. That this peptide adduct was branched and involved linkage between the ∈-amine of the YPK motif Lys residue and Thr carboxylate of the YALPNT sequence was ascertained from MS/MS analysis of the m/z 1410.45 fragment (supplemental Fig. S2B and supplemental Table S1). Formation of the branched peptide product, albeit in small amounts, highlights the intrinsic propensity of the YPK sequence to undergo transpeptidation.SrtA Catalyzed the Intramolecular Cyclization through Isopeptide Ligation in a Pilin Motif Sequence Nested with the LPXTG MotifNext a single peptide containing both the pilin motif and sortase-recognition sequence was designed to explore the possibility of oligomerization through isopeptide ligation at Lys183 (conserved Lys residue in the pilin motif of RrgB). Accordingly, a 24-mer peptide, VDAHVYPKNTEAKPKGGGLPNTGK (designated P2), was synthesized in which residues 176–190 of RrgB representing the pilin sequence was nested with an LPXTG sequence at the C terminus separated by a triglycine linker. Incubation of P2 with SrtA followed by RP-HPLC (supplemental Fig. S3) revealed the formation of two new peaks (3A and 3B), which were analyzed by ES-MS. The mass of peak 3A was determined to be 2292.3 Da, which fit to the calculated mass of the hydrolyzed peptide, VDAHVYPKNTEAKPKGGGLPNT (calculated 2292.18 Da). The experimental mass of peak 3B peptide was found to be 2275.23 Da. Interestingly this mass was about 18 units less than that of the hydrolyzed peptide, thus indicating the cyclic nature of this product. Further characterization of peak 3B, employing tryptic mapping, mass spectrometry, and Edman sequencing, was carried out to establish its identity.20 cycles of Edman degradation produced a single residue in each cycle (corresponding to residues 176–190 of RrgB) in the desired yield except for the 8th cycle where the expected Lys residue (Lys183) was present in very small amounts (supplemental Table S2) suggesting that this residue was derivatized. The RP-HPLC profile of the tryptic digest (supplemental Fig. S4) showed a single peak whose mass (2292.34 Da) was 18 units higher than that of the parent peptide (peak 3B) suggesting that tryptic cleavage occurred at a single peptide bond. Formation of such a product is consistent with a single point hydrolysis at the K-G peptide bond (supplemental Scheme 1) in the cyclized product because the Lys188–Pro189 bond will be recalcitrant to tryptic hydrolysis. Taken together, the results suggest that SrtA catalyzed the intramolecular cyclization through isopeptide ligation of the Thr carboxylate of the sortase-recognition sequence and conserved Lys of the YPK pilin sequence when the two motifs were nested together. Notably in this reaction, desired branching/oligomerization of the peptide was not observed.SrtA-mediated Transpeptidation Reaction of Indolicidin-derived PeptidesThe stereochemical proximity of the amino and carboxyl groups and their pKa appear to be two important thermodynamic factors that facilitate the formation of a peptide bond. Although the proximity effect diminishes the entropic cost of bringing the reacting ends together, lowering the pKa reduces the enthalpic barrier to peptide bond synthesis (40Homandberg G.A. Laskowski Jr., M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 41Wallace C.J.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the propensity of an ∈-amine of the pilin Lys residue to form isopeptide bond leading to branching or cyclization must be related to its pKa and proximity effects. The significant lowering of pKa could occur if the lysine is present in a hydrophobic environment. In fact, isopeptide bonds involving lysine residues in major pilin subunits in C. diphtheriae, Bacillus cereus, and S. pneumoniae, and minor pilin subunits Cpa in Streptococcus pyogenes, and RrgA and RrgC in S. pneumoniae, are found to be buried in hydrophobic cores (17Kang H.J.

The likely mechanism proposed for the formation of such bonds is that a hydrophobic environment alters the pKa of ionizable groups, in turn favoring a neutral form and facilitating a nucleophilic attack by the unprotonated lysine ∈-amino group (46Kang H.J. Baker E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 229-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Based on the above features (and some intuition!) a short, 13-mer antimicrobial peptide indolicidin was considered for further exploration of the sortase-mediated isopeptide ligation reaction. The indolicidin sequence contains five tryptophan residues and a single Lys residue flanked by hydrophobic indole rings (47Falla T.J. Karunaratne D.N. Hancock R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19298-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The indolicidin sequence length is similar to the pilin motif peptide tested above. Importantly, indolicidin displays antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as fungi. Indolicidin oligomeric derivatives may be useful as antibiotics.SrtA Catalyzed the Isopeptide Ligation of a LPXTG Peptide to IndolicidinThe ability of native indolicidin, ILPWKWPWWPWRR-NH2 (designated P3), to act as a nucleophile donor in SrtA-mediated transpeptidation was investigated. Incubation of this peptide with a LPXTG substrate, YALPNTGK, yielded a new product in addition to the hydrolyzed peptide, YALPNT (supplemental Fig. S5A). The mass of the new peptide (5A) was found to be 2565.43 Da, which fit to the calculated mass of an adduct (2564.37 Da) of YALPNT and P3 suggesting that this was a transpeptidation product (supplemental Fig. S5B). Two N-terminal peptide sequences namely, ILPWKWP and YALPNT, could be discerned from Edman degradation confirming that the transpeptidation generated a branched peptide through isopeptide ligation involving the Thr carboxylate and ∈-amino group of indolicidin Lys residue. Thus sortase-catalyzed intermolecular transfer of the LPXTG peptide to indolicidin occurred in much the same way as the pilin motif peptide.SrtA Produced a Cyclized Peptide and a Gamut of Isopeptide-linked Branched Oligomers from an Indolicidin Sequence Nested with an LPXTG MotifNext the intramolecular isopeptide ligation of indolicidin peptide containing the LPXTG motif separated by a triglycine linker was investigated just as was done in case of the pilin motif peptide. Accordingly, a 22-mer peptide sequence ILPWKWPWWPWRRGGGLPNTGK-NH2 (designated P4) was synthesized with an aim to examine if this peptide undergoes SrtA-catalyzed reaction in a manner similar to that observed in pilin motif peptide P2 or forms branched oligomer(s). Interestingly, incubation of P4 with sortase led to an array of reaction products. The RP-HPLC profile revealed six new peaks in addition to the parent peptide and SrtA. These peaks were designated as peaks 1–6 based on their order of elution from the reverse-phase column (Fig. 2). The individual peaks were collected and characterized by mass spectrometry (supplemental Table S3) and related methods as described below.FIGURE 2SrtA-catalyzed isopeptide ligation of LPXTG-embedded indolicidin sequence (P4). The reaction of P4 with SrtA was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” The reaction mixture was analyzed by RP-HPLC (C18 column, Phenomenex, 100 Å, 5 μ, 4.6 × 250 mm, gradient: 4–72% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA over 130 min, flow rate: 1 ml/min). The product peaks are numbered 1–6 in order of elution from the column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Peak 1The experimentally determined mass of peak 1 was found to be 20338.2 Da (Fig. 3A), which fits to the calculated mass of a covalent adduct of SrtA and the hydrolyzed peptide (ILPWKWPWWPWRRGGGLPNT, supplemental Table S3). Ten cycles of amino acid sequencing of peak 1 yielded two sequences corresponding to the first 10 residues of SrtA and indolicidin, respectively, indicating that the adduct was branched and may be a thioester acyl-enzyme intermediate. The co-presence of indolicidin and sortase peptide fragments as well as a unique fragment with m/z 2553.26 seen in the MALDI-TOF spectrum (Fig. 3B, supplemental Table S4) of the peak 1 tryptic digest corresponding to a branched sequence derived from active site residues 176–190 (DKQLTLITCDDYNEK) and RGGGLPNT sequence of P4 (supplemental Table S4, entry 9) confirmed the identity of peak 1 as an acyl-enzyme intermediate.FIGURE 3Mass spectrometric characterization of peak 1 obtained from reaction of SrtA and P4 (see Fig. 2). A, ES-MS analysis of peak 1 provided an experimental mass of 20338.2 Da, which corresponds to a covalent adduct of SrtA (17854.08 Da) and hydrolyzed peptide (ILPWKWPWWPWRRGGGLPNT, 2502.32 Da).

Tryptic digestion and ES-MS analyses were carried out to delineate if the dimer was linear or formed through isopeptide ligation involving the Thr carboxyl of one molecule to the Lys (∈-amine) of the other. Toward this, the tryptic digest of peak 3 was resolved by RP-HPLC (supplemental Fig. S6) and individual tryptic fragments labeled A to G were subjected to mass spectrometric analyses. The mass data (supplemental Table S5) of the tryptic fragments were commensurate with the branched nature of the dimer. Finally, 10 cycles of Edman degradation on tryptic fragment peak D (2345.19 Da) produced two sequences (supplemental Table S6) confirming peptide branching and intermolecular isopeptide ligation between Lys and Thr.Peak 4ES-MS of peak 4 revealed the presence of two molecular species with mass of 2484.26 and 7654.57 Da, respectively (supplemental Table S3). Indeed further fractionation of peak 4 on RP-HPLC using an altered gradient gave rise to two distinct peaks labeled 7A and 7B (supplemental Fig. S7). The mass of 7A (2484.2 Da) was about 18 Da less than that of the hydrolyzed peptide suggesting that 7A may be a cyclized product. To establish that this was indeed the case, peptide 7A was subjected to trypsin digestion. RP-HPLC fractionation of the digest (supplemental Fig. S8) predominantly revealed a single peptide whose mass was found to be 2346.68 Da. The mass of this peptide was 138 Da (2484 −2346 Da) less than the parent peptide (7A) and was equivalent to 18 units less than the mass of an Arg residue (156 Da). This could be interpreted to mean that cleavage occurred at both Arg sites leading to the excision of an Arg residue and that the Lys site was resistant to proteolysis due to its engagement in the cyclization reaction (supplemental Scheme 2). The mass of 7B (7658.03 Da) could fit to a covalent adduct composed of one molecule of the parent peptide (P4) and two molecules of the hydrolyzed peptide suggesting the trimeric nature of the molecule (supplemental Table S3).Peaks 5 and 6The mass of peak 5 was determined to be 10,139 Da (supplemental Table S3), which was in agreement with the calculated mass of an adduct comprising one molecule of the parent peptide (P4) and three molecules of the hydrolyzed peptide. Likewise, peak 6 gave a mass of 12,623 Da that fit to the composition of one molecule of the parent peptide (P4) and four molecules of the hydrolyzed peptide. These peaks were not characterized any further and were inferred, by analogy and pattern, as tetramer and pentamer, respectively.Thus SrtA action on P4 yielded a stable thioester acyl-enzyme intermediate, a cyclic monomer, and a gamut of oligomers (dimer, trimer, tetramer, and pentamer) in which one molecule of the parent peptide (P4) was linked to one or more molecules of the hydrolyzed peptide through an isopeptide linkage comprising the ∈-amine of Lys and α-carboxyl group of Thr. This is in contrast to the results seen in the case of the LPXTG-appended pilin motif peptide (P2) wher"

The polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion of huntingtin (Htt) is implicated in the pathogenesis of HD via interaction with an RNA splicing factor, Htt yeast two-hybrid protein A/forming-binding protein 11 (HYPA/FBP11). Besides the pathogenic polyQ expansion, Htt also contains a proline-rich region (PRR) located exactly in the C terminus to the polyQ tract. However, how the polyQ expansion influences the PRR-mediated protein interaction and how this abnormal interaction leads to the biological consequence remain elusive. Our NMR structural analysis indicates that the PRR motif of Htt cooperatively interacts with the tandem WW domains of HYPA through domain chaperoning effect of WW1 on WW2. The polyQ-expanded Htt sequesters HYPA to the cytosolic location and then significantly reduces the efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing.

The normal Htt exon 1 consists of a polyQ repeat of some 20 glutamines and a proline-rich region (PRR) of 40 amino acid residues and also has an additional 17 residues in the N terminus and 13 residues in the C terminus. Numerous proteins have been reported to interact with Htt (3Kaltenbach L.S. Romero E. Becklin R.R. Chettier R. Bell R. Phansalkar A. Strand A. Torcassi C. Savage J. Hurlburt A. Cha G.H. Ukani L.

These Htt-interacting proteins are engaged in transcription, trafficking, endocytosis, signaling, and metabolism, in which many proteins interact with Htt through the PRR region (4Li S.H. Li X.J.

The WW domain-containing proteins, such as Htt yeast two-hybrid proteins (HYPA, HYPB, and HYPC), interact with Htt protein through its PRR region, and these meet the genetic criteria for direct involvement in HD pathology (6Passani L.A. Bedford M.T. Faber P.W. McGinnis K.M. Sharp A.H. Gusella J.F. Vonsattel J.P. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2175-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). HYPA, a human homolog of mouse forming-binding protein 11 (FBP11), is a component of mammalian mRNA splicing U1 complex (7Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R.

Furthermore, mutation of the splicing factors or change in their stoichiometry can play important roles in diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (9Cooper T.A. Wan L.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction between Htt and HYPA might be associated with the pathogenesis of HD. The proline-rich motif that is included in the large Htt protein belongs to a particularly abundant group of molecular recognition domains that can interact with SH3, WW, EVH1 domains, and so on (11Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE8PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Usually these modular domains recognize short linear proline-rich motifs of not more than 10 residues (11Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE8PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). The PRR motif of Htt consists of almost 40 amino acid residues, whereas HYPA contains two WW domains in a tandem array (see Fig. 1A). This is reminiscent of a complicated mechanism underlying their specific interactions that may consequently impact on the cellular RNA processing. Our previous work elucidated the specific binding of Htt-PRR with SH3 and WW domains (13Gao Y.G. Yan X.Z. Song A.X. Chang Y.G. Gao X.C. Jiang N. Zhang Q. Hu H.Y. Structure. 2006; 14: 1755-1765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, how the expanded polyQ tract influences the interaction of Htt with HYPA and consequently impacts on the cellular function of HYPA are largely unknown. In this report, we applied structural and molecular biology approaches to study the interaction between PRR motif of Htt and the tandem WW domains of HYPA and the effect of polyQ expansion on the function of HYPA in cells. We propose that the toxic gain-of-function of the Htt mutants that causes dysfunction of cellular RNA processing is likely an alternative pathogenic way for HD. The cDNA encoding for the N-terminal 171 residues of Htt was cloned into a vector of pcDNA3.0 with a FLAG tag in the N terminus. The wild type and mutant Htt contains 18 and 100 repeated Gln residues denoted as Htt18Q and Htt100Q, respectively. The PRR-deleted mutant Htt100QΔP was cloned by ligation of N-terminal and C-terminal Htt100Q. Although many efforts tried, we have not got the clone of full-length HYPA. To mimic the full-length protein, we cloned the DNA fragments for the N-terminal residues 1–423 (6Passani L.A. Bedford M.T. Faber P.W. McGinnis K.M. Sharp A.H. Gusella J.F. Vonsattel J.P.

Mutation of PYYY to TYYY in WW2 was produced according to the corresponding sequence of WW1 and denoted as P67T for the sake of structural analysis. Several mutants in WW1 and WW2 domains or the linker regions were produced and named as W38A, W79A, W38A/W79A, GS-Sub, and Su(dx)-Linker, respectively. The peptides corresponding to the sequence of Htt PRR (PP1, PP3, PP12, PP23, and PP35) were obtained from solid-phase synthesis and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The plasmids encoding proteins were transformed to Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The proteins were purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity column followed by gel filtration chromatography. 15N/13C-Labeled proteins were prepared by using the M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and/or d-[13C6]glucose as the sole nitrogen and/or carbon resource, respectively. The sample containing ∼1 mm 15N/13C-labeled 2WW-P67T protein in a phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 6.0) was used for the structural determination by NMR as our previous study (13Gao Y.G. Yan X.Z.

All data acquisition was carried out at 25 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 spectrometer. For the backbone and side-chain assignments, spectra of HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, C(CO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY were obtained. NOE restraints were obtained from 15N- and 13C-edited NOE spectra. The NMR data were processed by using NMRPipe (15Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and analyzed with SPARKY (16Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2008Google Scholar). Backbone dihedral restraints were derived from TALOS program (17Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints for the backbone consistent with NOE patterns were also added. The structures were calculated using ARIA2.0 (18Rieping W. Habeck M. Bardiaux B. Bernard A. Malliavin T.E. Nilges M. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), assessed by PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

HEK 293T cells were transfected by FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. For fractionating the cytosolic and nuclear proteins, procedures were strictly followed according to the instruction manual (Beyond Time). The antibodies used were as follows: anti-FLAG (Sigma) and anti-Myc (Cell signaling) antibodies, mouse polyclonal anti-HYPA antibody (Abnova), and mouse polyclonal anti-tubulin (Sigma) or rabbit polyclonal anti-SP1 antibody. For confocal microscopy, HEK 293T cells were grown on glass coverslips for 48 h after transfection. Images were obtained on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). Pre-mRNA splicing was assayed by recording the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities accordingly (22Nasim M.T. Eperon I.C. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1022-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Che M.X. Jiang Y.J. Xie Y.Y. Jiang L.L. Hu H.Y. FASEB J. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed at 48 h after transfection, and the activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase on hydrolyzing the substrates (Promega) were measured using GLOMAX Luminometer (Promega). HEK 293T cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid containing minigene TG13T5 (23Che M.X. Jiang Y.J. Xie Y.Y. Jiang L.L. Hu H.Y. FASEB J. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection, and the total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized by retro-transcription from 1 μg of total RNA with ReverTra Ace-α (TOYOBO). Secondary PCR was carried out by using the following primers: Bra-2, 5′-TAGGATCCGGTCACCAGGAAGTTGGTTAAATCA-3′; a2-3, 5′-CAACTTCAAGCTCCTAAGCCACTGC-3′. For small RNA-mediated interference, the sequences of the small RNAs were as follows: siHYPA1, 5′-GAAGAGUGCACCACAACAUTT-3′; siHYPA2, 5′-GUGUGGAAGUAUCCAGUAATT-3′; control siRNA, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′. It was reported that Htt interacts with HYPA through the N-terminal PRR and the tandem WW domains (Fig. 1A) (24Faber P.W. Barnes G.T. Srinidhi J. Chen J. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Our previous work identified that the first and third portions of Htt PRR specifically interact with the tandem WW domains (13Gao Y.G. Yan X.Z. Song A.X. Chang Y.G. Gao X.C. Jiang N. Zhang Q. Hu H.Y. Structure. 2006; 14: 1755-1765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To better understand how the tandem WW domains of HYPA interact with the Htt PRR motif, we used GST pulldown experiments to characterize the interactions between N-terminal Htt and different GST-fused WW domains (Fig. 1B). Although not strictly quantitative, GST pulldown consistently shows that the tandem WW domains (2WW) interact with the N-terminal fragment (residues 1–171) of normal Htt (Htt18Q) stronger than the individual WW1 and WW2 domains, whereas the binding of WW2 with Htt18Q is weaker than that of WW1. A similar result is also obtained from the polyQ-expanded Htt (Htt100Q), which shows stronger binding affinity with 2WW than the single WW domains (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, only Htt100Q but not Htt18Q can be precipitated by HYPA in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment (supplemental Fig. S1A), although both Htt18Q and Htt100Q exhibit interaction with HYPA in the GST pulldown (supplemental Fig. S1B). This inconsistency is probably due to the different sensitivities of these two biochemical techniques under different experimental conditions. We further characterize the structural properties of different WW domains by NMR spectroscopy. The WW1 domain shows a wide dispersion of chemical shifts in both 1H and 15N dimensions of the HSQC spectrum (supplemental Fig. S1C), indicating that WW1 forms a well folded structure. However, the HSQC spectrum of the WW2 domain exhibits few resonance peaks and narrow dispersion of the chemical shifts (supplemental Fig. S1D), suggesting that WW2 is unstructured in solution. The unfolded WW2 domain may be the major cause for its weak binding with Htt18Q (Fig. 1B). We recorded the HSQC spectrum of 2WW under the same conditions used for WW1 and WW2. The spectrum shows wide chemical-shift dispersion and relatively sharp line widths of the resonances, indicating that both domain moieties in 2WW are well folded in solution (supplemental Fig. S1E). The overlay plot of the three spectra shows that most resonances of WW2 do not overlap with those in 2WW (Fig. 1D). This indicates that the WW1 domain may have a chaperoning effect on WW2, which means folding of WW1 is beneficial to the folding of the WW2 moiety. This chaperoning effect of WW1 on WW2 may enhance the interaction of 2WW with Htt18Q, as compared with single WW1 and WW2. Thus, the domain chaperoning effect provides implication that the tandem WW domains of HYPA cooperatively interact with the N-terminal fragment of Htt. WW domains are small protein modules composed of ∼40 amino acid residues (25Macias M.J. Wiesner S. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). For structural analysis, we made a mutation of Pro-67 in WW2 to Thr residue, which leads to improvement of the NMR spectra in the WW2 moiety (supplemental Fig. S2A) but no considerable difference of the chemical shifts in 2WW (supplemental Fig. S2B). Thus, the mutation is considered to have little effect on both its structure and binding ability (see below). We elucidated the solution structure of the tandem WW domains (2WW-P67T) by NMR techniques (a summary of the experimental restraints and structural model statistics is shown in supplemental Table S1). Fig. 2A shows the superposition of 10 lowest-energy structures of 2WW-P67T. Each WW domain folds as a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and is connected by a short α-helical linker (Fig. 2B). The structure was refined very well by using only short-range restraints as NOEs, hydrogen bonds, and dihedral angles (supplemental Table S1). This structure is somehow similar to that of its yeast homologue Prp40 (26Wiesner S. Stier G. Sattler M. Macias M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which was elucidated based on residual dipolar coupling (RDC) restraints besides NOEs. Especially, the structure includes a rigid helical linker that is close to WW2, implying that the helix contributes to the chaperoning effect on the folding of WW2. This structure is different from those of the tandem WW domains of another splicing factor FBP21 (supplemental Fig. S2D) (27Huang X. Beullens M. Zhang J. Zhou Y. Nicolaescu E. Lesage B. Hu Q. Wu J. Bollen M. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25375-25387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the Notch signaling suppressor Su(dx) (supplemental Fig. S2E) (28Fedoroff O.Y. Townson S.A. Golovanov A.P. Baron M. Avis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34991-35000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); both structures contain disordered linkers. Compared with the tandem WW domains of Prp40, that has a long helical linker (supplemental Fig. S2F), 2WW of HYPA contains a shorter α-helical linker, and the binding pockets of the WW domains point toward each other. The heteronuclear 15N-{1H} NOEs provides further evidence that 2WW of HYPA tumbles as a unit fold due to the similar motions of the linker region with the two domains (supplemental Fig. S2C). In comparison of the WW1 and WW2 units in 2WW of HYPA, it gives a backbone r.m.s.d. of 1.88 Å (supplemental Fig. S2G), whereas the backbone r.m.s.d. is up to 1.9 Å when comparing the structure of WW1 unit in 2WW with that of the isolated WW1 domain from this protein (Fig. 2C) (29Kato Y. Hino Y. Nagata K. Tanokura M. Proteins. 2006; 63: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because the structure of the linker region between the two WW domains in HYPA is significantly different from any known structures of tandem WW domains (26Wiesner S. Stier G. Sattler M. Macias M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Huang X. Beullens M. Zhang J. Zhou Y. Nicolaescu E. Lesage B. Hu Q. Wu J. Bollen M. Shi Y. J. Biol.

Substitution with DSGGS (GS-Sub) is designed to destroy the helical linker, whereas substitution with the linker from Su(dx) (Su(dx)-Linker) is to insert an extended region. By using fluorescence titration with dansyl chloride (DNS)-labeled Htt-35 peptide (Fig. 2D), both the linker mutations present decreases of the binding affinities with Htt-PP35 (Table 1). This demonstrates that the helical linker plays an important role in cooperative interaction with Htt PRR, and the two WW domains of HYPA act as an ensemble structurally for the specific interaction.TABLE 1Binding affinities (KD) of 2WW and its mutants with Htt-PP35 peptide as determined by fluorescence titrationWTW38AW79AP67TGS-SubaThe linker substitution mutants were generated based on the P67T mutant of 2WW.Su(dx)-LinkeraThe linker substitution mutants were generated based on the P67T mutant of 2WW.KD (μm)10.6 ± 2.851.6 ± 14.9524 ± 10729.3 ± 5.383.4 ± 11.194.0 ± 6.1a The linker substitution mutants were generated based on the P67T mutant of 2WW. Open table in a new tab In general, WW domains recognize short proline-rich motifs typically of not more than 10 amino acid residues (11Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE8PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). However, the PRR motif of Htt contains almost 40 residues. Thus, the experiment is designed to understand how 2WW interacts with the long PRR motif. By using NMR and fluorescence titrations, we elucidated the interaction between the tandem WW domains of HYPA and Htt PRR. Because the middle portion of Htt PRR does not contribute to bind with the 2WW domains (13Gao Y.G. Yan X.Z. Song A.X. Chang Y.G. Gao X.C. Jiang N. Zhang Q. Hu H.Y. Structure. 2006; 14: 1755-1765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we performed chemical shift perturbation on the interactions of the 15N-labeled 2WW with several peptides based on the first and third portions (Fig. 3A). As in the literatures (11Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: RE8PubMed Google Scholar, 25Macias M.J. Wiesner S. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), Htt-PP1 and Htt-PP3 bind to both WW domains on the hydrophobic sites formed by Thr-17/Lys-58, Glu-18/59, His-19/Tyr-60, Tyr-27/69, Tyr-28/70, Ser-36/77, and Trp-38/79 (Fig. 3, B and C). These residues show large chemical shift changes, but the linker residues remain unperturbed. Besides the large chemical shift changes in the domain regions, Htt-PP35 titration also causes dramatic chemical shift changes in the linker region (residues 42–53), suggesting that the linker region is involved in the interaction (Fig. 3D). The elongated peptides Htt-PP12 and Htt-PP23 can also cause similar effects on the linker (supplemental Fig. S3). Accordingly, we speculate that the tandem WW domains of HYPA interact with full-length Htt-PRR in a bipartite manner. We also determined the dissociation constants of different WW domains with different peptides by NMR titration (Table 2). During Htt-PP35 titration, the chemical shift changes of the corresponding residues in both WW1 and WW2 moieties are almost the same (Fig. 3D). Based on the titration curves, we calculated the binding affinities with a stoichiometry of 1:2 for the binding of 2WW with Htt-PP1 or Htt-PP3. In the tandem array, the WW2 moiety has increased affinities with Htt-PP1 and Htt-PP3, respectively, whereas WW1 does not (Table 2). This provides further evidence for the interdomain chaperoning effect between WW1 and WW2. Moreover, the affinity for 2WW binding with Htt-PP35 is dramatically increased (Table 1). Comparison of the binding affinities of W38A and W79A mutants with wild-type 2WW suggests a more important role of the WW2 moiety in tandem WW domains. Taken together, these results further demonstrate that the tandem WW domains of HYPA cooperatively interact with Htt PRR in a bipartite manner; that is, both two WW domains of HYPA and two peptide segments of Htt PPR are all engaged in the cooperative interaction.TABLE 2Binding affinities (KD) of the WW domains with various Htt-PRR peptides as determined by NMR titrationKD (μm)PP1PP3PP12PP23PP35WW1683 ± 110282 ± 77WW2 (P67T)1661 ± 3191435 ± 2162WW (P67T)772 ± 219236 ± 131308 ± 167185 ± 45∼10 Open table in a new tab Expanded polyQ tract can cause Htt to interact abnormally with a variety of proteins to gain its toxic function (4Li S.H. Li X.J. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 146-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The WW domain-containing proteins may be also engaged in the disease pathogenesis (6Passani L.A. Bedford M.T. Faber P.W. McGinnis K.M. Sharp A.H. Gusella J.F. Vonsattel J.P. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2175-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the effects of the polyQ expansion on HYPA interaction and cellular distribution, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and microscopic experiments. As a control, HYPA cannot be precipitated by normal Htt18Q protein (Fig. 4A), but a different situation occurs in the case of the isolated 2WW (Fig. 1B). However, HYPA can be precipitated by polyQ-expanded Htt100Q (Fig. 4A). Compared with wild-type HYPA, the amounts of HYPA mutants in the 2WW region precipitated by Htt100Q are reduced, in the order W38A, W79A, and W38A/W79A. This result suggests that in the context of HYPA, the tandem WW domains can access to the full-length PRR motif in the polyQ-expanded form of Htt in a bipartite manner. Normally, HYPA is localized in nuclear speckle (30Mizutani K. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), whereas Htt18Q is dominantly localized in cytosol and the polyQ-expanded Htt100Q is localized both in cytosol and nucleus (31DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). To directly observe the co-localization of Htt and HYPA in cells, we applied confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging (Fig. 4B). In most HEK 293T cells overexpressed with Htt18Q and HYPA, as usual, Htt18Q is mostly localized in cytosol, whereas HYPA is in the nucleus (first row). To our surprise, when Htt100Q overexpressed with HYPA, these two proteins are co-localized mostly in the cytosol (second row), suggesting that HYPA is sequestered to the cytosol by Htt100Q but not by Htt18Q. Abnormal Htt100Q can also sequester W38A and W79A mutants of HYPA to the cytosol but to less extent (Fig. 4, B and C). To further examine whether Htt100Q can redistribute endogenous HYPA, we prepared nuclear and cytosolic extracts from HEK 293T cells transfected with mock vector, Htt18Q, or Htt100Q (Fig. 4D). Western blotting indicates that the endogenous HYPA is decreased in the nuclear fraction when transfected with Htt100Q but not with Htt18Q, whereas the cytosolic fraction is still undetectable due to a small amount of the endogenous HYPA and low sensitivity of the polyclonal antibody we used. These results demonstrate that polyQ expansion enhances interaction with HYPA and triggers cellular redistribution of HYPA. This abnormal interaction can be considered to be a partial contribution of the polyQ-expanded Htt to the pathogenesis of HD. HYPA is one of the constitutive components of splicesome U1 complex that can enhance the efficiency of RNA splicing in mammalian cells (7Wahl M.C. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Cell. 2009; 136: 701-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, 8Lin K.T. Lu R.M. Tarn W.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9176-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because HYPA could be sequestered by polyQ-expanded Htt, investigating the biological consequences of the abnormal interaction and redistribution is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of HD caused by mutant Htt. To examine whether Htt100Q can influence pre-mRNA splicing, we performed in vivo splicing assays after transient transfection of vector, Htt18Q, or Htt100Q. The splicing efficiency was quantified by using pTN23 reporter gene (22Nasim M.T. Eperon I.C. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1022-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Unspliced transcripts yield only β-galactosidase, whereas spliced transcripts express a fusion protein with both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (supplemental Fig. S4). Thus, the ratio of luciferase over β-galactosidase activity stands quantitatively for the pre-mRNA splicing efficiency. As a result, transfection of Htt100Q in HEK 293T cells can significantly reduce the pre-mRNA splicing efficiency, as compared with transfection of Htt18Q (Fig. 5A). As a control, transfection of polyQ expanded ataxin-3 (Atx371Q) has no significant effect on the pre-mRNA splicing, as in the case of normal ataxin-3 (Atx322Q).

https://openalex.org/W2090307137,"The pathologic response to implant wear-debris constitutes a major component of inflammatory osteolysis and remains under intense investigation. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles, which are released during implant wear and loosening, constitute a major culprit by virtue of inducing inflammatory and osteolytic responses by macrophages and osteoclasts, respectively. Recent work by several groups has identified important cellular entities and secreted factors that contribute to inflammatory osteolysis. In previous work, we have shown that PMMA particles contribute to inflammatory osteolysis through stimulation of major pathways in monocytes/macrophages, primarily NF-κB and MAP kinases. The former pathway requires assembly of large IKK complex encompassing IKK1, IKK2, and IKKγ/NEMO. We have shown recently that interfering with the NF-κB and MAPK activation pathways, through introduction of inhibitors and decoy molecules, impedes PMMA-induced inflammation and osteolysis in mouse models of experimental calvarial osteolysis and inflammatory arthritis. In this study, we report that PMMA particles activate the upstream transforming growth factor β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), which is a key regulator of signal transduction cascades leading to activation of NF-κB and AP-1 factors. More importantly, we found that PMMA particles induce TAK1 binding to NEMO and UBC13. In addition, we show that PMMA particles induce TRAF6 and UBC13 binding to NEMO and that lack of TRAF6 significantly attenuates NEMO ubiquitination. Altogether, these observations suggest that PMMA particles induce ubiquitination of NEMO, an event likely mediated by TRAF6, TAK1, and UBC13. Our findings provide important information for better understanding of the mechanisms underlying PMMA particle-induced inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W1994330689,"The RNA polymerase II (pol II) initiation and elongation factor elongation factor TFIIF can be extensively phosphorylated in vivo, although the significance of this modification has not been clear. We now show that phosphorylation of recombinant TFIIF by casein kinase 2 (CK2) reduces or eliminates some of the functions of TFIIF while paradoxically leaving others intact. Phospho-IIF is fully functional in binding to free pol II and is able to support the initiation of transcription. However, the phosphorylated factor does not bind to stalled elongation complexes as measured in a gel mobility shift assay. Significantly, phosphorylation strongly reduces (or for some truncated versions of RAP74, eliminates) stimulation of transcript elongation by TFIIF. Thus, although TFIIF must participate at the initiation of transcription, its ability to continue its association with pol II and stimulate transcript elongation can be specifically regulated by CK2. This is particularly interesting because CK2 is required for initiation at a subset of pol II promoters. Modulation of TFIIF function could be important in controlling promoter-proximal pausing by pol II during the early stage of transcript elongation."

Here we first sought to delineate the Vpr determinants involved in the binding to DCAF1 and to the target. On the one hand, the three α-helices of Vpr are necessary and sufficient for binding to DCAF1; on the other hand, nonlinear determinants in Vpr are required for binding to the target, as shown by using protein chimeras. We also underscore that a SRIG motif conserved in the C-terminal tail of Vpr proteins from HIV-1/SIVcpz and HIV-2/SIVsmm lineages is critical for G(2) arrest. Our results suggest that this motif may be predictive of the ability of Vpr proteins from other SIV lineages to mediate G(2) arrest. We took advantage of the characterization of a subset of G(2) arrest-defective, but DCAF1 binding-proficient mutants, to investigate whether Vpr interferes with cell viability independently of its ability to induce G(2) arrest. These mutants inhibited cell colony formation in HeLa cells and are cytotoxic in lymphocytes, unmasking a G(2) arrest-independent cytopathic effect of Vpr. Furthermore these mutants do not block cell cycle progression at the G(1) or S phases but trigger apoptosis through caspase 3. Disruption of DCAF1 binding restored efficiency of colony formation. However, DCAF1 binding per se is not sufficient to confer cytopathicity. These data support a model in which Vpr recruits DCAF1 to induce the degradation of two host proteins independently required for proper cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2100351886,"The DNA helicase encoded by gene 4 of bacteriophage T7 forms a hexameric ring in the presence of dTTP, allowing it to bind DNA in its central core. The oligomerization also creates nucleotide-binding sites located at the interfaces of the subunits. DNA binding stimulates the hydrolysis of dTTP but the mechanism for this two-step control is not clear. We have identified a glutamate switch, analogous to the glutamate switch found in AAA+ enzymes that couples dTTP hydrolysis to DNA binding. A crystal structure of T7 helicase shows that a glutamate residue (Glu-343), located at the subunit interface, is positioned to catalyze a nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of a bound nucleoside 5'-triphosphate. However, in the absence of a nucleotide, Glu-343 changes orientation, interacting with Arg-493 on the adjacent subunit. This interaction interrupts the interaction of Arg-493 with Asn-468 of the central β-hairpin, which in turn disrupts DNA binding. When Glu-343 is replaced with glutamine the altered helicase, unlike the wild-type helicase, binds DNA in the presence of dTDP. When both Arg-493 and Asn-468 are replaced with alanine, dTTP hydrolysis is no longer stimulated in the presence of DNA. Taken together, these results suggest that the orientation of Glu-343 plays a key role in coupling nucleotide hydrolysis to the binding of DNA."

The present study identifies a potential antigenic stimulus that might trigger systemic lupus erythematosus in a subset of patients. An immunodominant peptide (p185(378–394)) derived from the c-erbB2 gene product, was recognized by an anti-DNA antibody, B3, and importantly by two classical DNA-binding proteins, Tgo polymerase and Pa-UDG. These reactivities were inhibited by DNA, confirming that the peptide mimicked DNA. BALB/c mice immunized with p185(378–394) developed significant titers of IgG anti-dsDNA antibodies. Screening of 39 human lupus sera revealed that 5% of these sera possessed reactivity toward p185(378–394). Representative mouse and human sera with anti-p185(378–394) reactivity bound intact p185, and this binding was inhibited by dsDNA. This is the first demonstration of a naturally occurring autoantigen mimotope. The present study identifies a potential antigenic stimulus that might trigger systemic lupus erythematosus in a subset of patients. IgG anti-dsDNA antibodies are serological markers of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 2The abbreviations used are: SLEsystemic lupus erythematosusMAPmultiple antigenic peptide. (1Isenberg D.A.

Katz J.B. Paul E. Aranow C. Lustgarten D. Scharff M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 731-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Given that mammalian dsDNA is a poor immunogen (5Madaio M.P. Hodder S. Schwartz R.S. Stollar B.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 872-876PubMed Google Scholar) and that some bacterial DNAs although immunogenic in normal mouse strains, do not elicit the production of antibodies cross-reactive with eukaryotic DNA (6Pisetsky D.S. Grudier J.P. Gilkeson G.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Gilkeson G.S. Pippen A.M. Pisetsky D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1398-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the nature of the original trigger inducing the production of these human disease-specific antibodies, remains unclear. However, a screening of peptide libraries has recently identified some molecular motifs that are recognized by a subset of murine pathogenic antibodies (8Gaynor B. Putterman C. Valadon P. Spatz L. Scharff M.D. Diamond B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 1955-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and that generate anti-dsDNA reactivity in nonautoimmune mice following immunization (9Putterman C. Diamond B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Attempts have also been made to use DNA mimotope peptides for elimination of the B cells producing anti-dsDNA antibodies as a therapy of SLE (10Dimitrova I. Gesheva V. Nikolova K. Mihaylova N. Todorov T. Nikolova M. Tchorbanov A. Lupus. 2010; 19: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In our study investigating the role of heavy and light chains of human autoantibodies in determining their anti-DNA/cardiolipin binding activity (11Kumar S. Kalsi J. Ravirajan C.T. Rahman A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35129-35136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we employed the Fab construct of an anti-p185 antibody as a negative control. To our surprise, however, the anti-p185 antibody exhibited significant anti-DNA reactivity both against calf thymus DNA in traditional ELISA (12Le Page S.H. Williams W. Parkhouse D. Cambridge G. MacKenzie L. Lydyard P.M. Isenberg D.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1989; 77: 314-318PubMed Google Scholar) and against a synthetic oligonucleotide in a novel ELISA (11Kumar S. Kalsi J. Ravirajan C.T.

Matsubara K. Yoshida M. Sasaki M. Suzuki T. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and is homologous to, but distinct from, the EGF receptor. c-erbB2 is the human analog of the transforming neu proto-oncogene, found originally in a rat neuroblastoma cell line (14Padhy L.C. Shih C. Cowing D. Finkelstein R. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 865-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The product of the c-erbB2 proto-oncogene is a trans-membrane glycoprotein of 185 kDa, which, due to its structure (15Akiyama T. Sudo C. Ogawara H. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1986; 232: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) and localization on the membrane, seems to be a receptor for a new growth factor (16Gullick W.J. Berger M.S. Bennett P.L. Rothbard J.B. Waterfield M.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 40: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In normal breast cells, c-erbB2 is present as a single gene copy, whereas its amplification and consequent overexpression have been found in 25–30% (17van de Vijver M.J. Mooi W.J. Peterse J.L. Nusse R. Eur. J. Surg. Oncol. 1988; 14: 111-114PubMed Google Scholar, 18Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9746) Google Scholar) of primary human breast cancer cases. This evidence stimulated a considerable clinical interest in the role played by the c-erbB2 gene in breast cancer. Different studies (19De Potter C.R. Van Daele S. Van de Vijver M.J. Pauwels C. Maertens G. De Boever J. Vandekerckhove D. Roels H. Histopathology. 1989; 15: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Natali P.G. Nicotra M.R. Bigotti A. Venturo I. Slamon D.J. Fendly B.M. Ullrich A. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that when overexpressed, the c-erbB2 gene product represents a tumor-restricted marker. Anti-p185 antibodies are currently being evaluated for their immunotherapeutic potential against breast cancer (21Zhou X.X. Ji F. Zhao J.L. Cheng L.F. Xu C.F. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2010; 257: 1266-1275Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Goldenberg M.M. Clin. Ther. 1999; 21: 309-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 23Park B.W. Zhang H.T.

Interestingly, p185-interacting molecules (e.g. EGF) would appear to possess reactivity against molecules similar to DNA. For example, one class of EGF binds heparin, a sulfated polyanion with affinity for DNA-binding proteins in general (24Wells A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) and interacts with p185 (25Ethier S.P. Langton B.C. Dilts C.A. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Given the observed anti-DNA activity of anti-p185 antibody, we asked if antibodies reactive to DNA also bind p185. Interestingly, an immunodominant epitope, p185(378–394), derived from the extracellular domain of p185, possessed the conserved part of the consensus motif previously shown to be recognized by a subset of anti-DNA antibodies (26Spatz L. Iliev A. Saenko V. Jones L. Irigoyen M. Manheimer-Lory A. Gaynor B. Putterman C. Bynoe M. Kowal C. Kuo P. Newman J. Diamond B. Methods. 1997; 11: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Using two well characterized autoantibodies, B3 (anti-dsDNA) and UK4 (anti-cardiolipin), in combination with the synthetic p185(378–394) peptide, we now report that such cross-reactivity does indeed exist. These IgG λ mAbs were derived from SLE patients and were selected because of their known distinct and diverse pathogenic properties. The light chains of B3 and UK4 are encoded by the 2A2 gene segment known to be the most commonly used among humans (27Ignatovich O. Tomlinson I.M. Jones P.T. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with no known mouse homologue (28Williams S.C. Frippiat J.P. Tomlinson I.M. Ignatovich O. Lefranc M.P. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Furthermore, B3 light chain, earlier shown to possess anti-DNA activity (11Kumar S. Kalsi J. Ravirajan C.T. Rahman A. Athwal D. Latchman D.S. Isenberg D.A. Pearl L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35129-35136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), possesses the 8.12 idiotope and is encoded by the Vλ2 gene family most commonly expressed in humans (27Ignatovich O. Tomlinson I.M. Jones P.T. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The 8.12 idiotope is of particular interest because its presence has been shown in SLE glomerular lesions, and the titers of 8.12+ antibodies are elevated in the serum of up to 50% of patients with SLE (29Isenberg D. Williams W. Axford J. Bakimer R. Bell D. Casaseca-Grayson T. Diamond B. Ebling F. Hahn B. Harkiss G. J. Autoimmun. 1990; 4: 393-414Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that anti-DNA and anti-p185 activities co-exist on the light chain of B3. Importantly, the peptide was recognized by two classical DNA-binding proteins, Tgo polymerase and Pa-UDG, in a DNA-inhibitable manner, confirming that the peptide mimics DNA structurally. To investigate a possible role of p185 in the induction of anti-dsDNA antibodies, we immunized BALB/c mice with the peptide p185(378–394) configured as a multimer on a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) backbone (30Tam J.P Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar, 31Tam J.P J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 196: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The immunized BALB/c mice developed significant titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies as well as glomerular immunoglobulin deposition suggestive of lupus nephritis. We now demonstrate that a subset of human lupus sera possess reactivity toward p185(378–394) and that these sera could recognize intact p185 in a dsDNA-inhibitable manner. This is the first demonstration of the presence of an autoantigen (dsDNA) mimotope on a naturally occurring eukaryotic cell molecule in humans. The present study identifies a potential antigenic stimulus that might trigger SLE. This is also the first report of promiscuous binding of a DNA look-alike protein molecule by classical DNA-binding proteins. The cloning, expression, preparation of the periplasm, and purification of the Fabs of the human autoantibodies B3 and UK4 and the related hybrids have been described previously (11Kumar S. Kalsi J. Ravirajan C.T. Rahman A. Athwal D. Latchman D.S. Isenberg D.A. Pearl L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35129-35136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Periplasmic extracts prepared from E. coli with or without IPTG induction were tested in an anti-DNA antibody ELISA involving a biotinylated 35-mer oligonucleotide in its single- or double-stranded form (11Kumar S. Kalsi J. Ravirajan C.T. Rahman A. Athwal D. Latchman D.S. Isenberg D.A. Pearl L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35129-35136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) for the evaluation of DNA binding activities of the recombinant Fabs. p185(378–394) (PESFDGDPASNTAPLQPE) was synthesized (Alta Bioscience, Birmingham, UK) with N terminus biotin conjugation. The polystyrene plates were coated (4 °C, overnight) with streptavidin (5 μg/ml, half of the wells) and Moα-HL (1:1000; one-fourth of the wells). The biotinylated peptide was applied to the streptavidin-coated wells (5 μg/ml, 1 h, 37 °C). The plate was blocked (2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, 1 h, 37 °C), and the periplasmic preparations were applied (1 h, 37 °C). The binding was detected using goat α-HL conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. The DNA/p185(378–394)-specific binding is expressed in relation to that for Moα-HL as percentage of binding using the equation, percentage binding = ((ODDNA/p185 − background)/(ODMoα-Hλ − background)) × 100. The Fab preparations of BB were mixed with calf thymus dsDNA (the final DNA concentration ranging in doubling dilution from 500 to 1.95 μg/ml), incubated (37 °C, 3 h), and applied (1 h, 37 °C) to the plates precoated with p185(378–394), and the binding was detected as described above. The first of the two letters in the name of the Fab construct from B3 and UK4 denotes the light chain, and the second of the letters denotes the heavy chain. The gene encoding for thermostable type B DNA polymerase from Thermococcus gorgonarius (Tgo polymerase) was obtained from Dr. B. A. Connolly (Newcastle, UK) and expressed in E. coli (BL21DE3) (Novagen) using the expression vector pET17b (Novagen) under the control of the T7 promoter. Protein expression and its initial purification were carried out as described previously (32Greagg M.A. Fogg M.J. Panayotou G. Evans S.J. Connolly B.A. Pearl L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9045-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The protein thus obtained was concentrated in an Amicon Centriprep-50 centrifugal concentrator and loaded onto a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) column. The fractions containing the pure protein were determined by SDS-PAGE and pooled. The gene encoding for Pyrobaculum aerophilum Pa-UDG was obtained from Dr. J. Jiricny (Institute of Medical Radiobiology, Zürich, Switzerland) on the plasmid pET28-paudg, a derivative of pET28c(+) (Novagen). The protein was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminal His6-tagged Pa-UDG under the control of the Lac operator and the T7 RNA polymerase and was purified to homogeneity by immobilized metal affinity chromatography as described previously (33Sartori A.A. Schär P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The binding of Tgo polymerase and Pa-UDG to p185(378–394) was evaluated in a solid-phase binding assay. Polystyrene plates were coated with the purified proteins (20 μg/ml, 250 μl/well, overnight, 4 °C) prepared in a modified Pfu buffer (20 mm Trizma base, pH 8.8, 10 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm magnesium sulfate, 2 mm magnesium chloride). The plates were washed (three times) and blocked (1% BSA in the modified Pfu buffer, 37 °C, 2 h). The biotinylated p185(378–394) peptide was diluted in the modified Pfu buffer containing 100 μg/ml BSA (six doubling dilutions starting from 80 μg/ml). The different dilutions of the peptide were applied to polystyrene plates precoated with Tgo or Pa-UDG. Calf thymus dsDNA was diluted (three doubling dilutions starting from 25 μg/ml) in the modified Pfu buffer containing 100 μg/ml BSA and applied to half of the wells (in duplicate) precoated with Tgo or Pa-UDG (37 °C, 1 h). The plates were washed (six times). The peptide was applied either directly to untreated wells in the absence of calf thymus dsDNA or in the presence of the dsDNA dilutions to the wells treated with corresponding dsDNA concentration and incubated (1 h, 37 °C). The binding of the peptide was evaluated using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. Immunization was as follows. Female BALB/c mice (Harlan, Bicester, UK; age 6 weeks) were acclimatized in the animal facility for 2 weeks before immunization. Mice were immunized with either 100 μg of p185(378–394) MAP peptide emulsified 1:1 (v/v) with complete Freund's adjuvant (n = 5) or with 100 μg of p185(378–394) MAP peptide in saline without adjuvant (n = 5). Control groups of mice received MAP lysine backbone either emulsified with CFA (n = 5) or in saline without adjuvant (n = 5). The mice were boosted on days 7, 14, and 21, with incomplete Freund's adjuvant being substituted for CFA. At each immunization, half the dose was administered subcutaneously, and half was given intraperitoneally. The mice were tail-bled on days 11, 30 and 74 and sacrificed on day 107 with kidneys collected for analysis. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Mouse sera were evaluated for the presence of anti-DNA antibodies by a standard ELISA and a pull-down ELISA as described below. Mice sera were tested in an anti-DNA antibody ELISA involving a biotinylated 35-mer oligonucleotide in its single- or double-stranded form (11Kumar S. Kalsi J. Ravirajan C.T. Rahman A. Athwal D.

Biotinylated or nonbiotinylated 35-mer oligonucleotides (5′-biotin-CCGAATCAGTTCACTTCCAGCCCAGGTATTTAGCC-3′ and its nonbiotinylated complementary strand) (11Kumar S. Kalsi J. Ravirajan C.T. Rahman A.

Hybridization of the equimolar concentrations of the two nucleotides was performed in 1 m NaCl, 20 mm monosodium phosphate, 0.1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 7 (1 h, 37 °C) as recommended by Pharmacia Biosensor AB (Application Note 306, 1995) to achieve the final dsDNA concentration of 4 μg/μl. Two microliters of each serum were mixed with 50 μl of PBS containing 2 μg of dsDNA and incubated overnight at room temperature. The volume of the mixture was then raised to 500 μl and applied in duplicate (250 μl/well) to the polystyrene plates precoated (4 °C, overnight) with streptavidin (10 μg/ml, 250 μl/well) and blocked with 10% FCS (2 h, 37 °C), and the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies pulled out by biotinylated dsDNA were detected. Binding of the serum IgG (1:150) to p185(378–394) peptide was evaluated as described above for the Fab fragments. Mouse sera diluted in PBS (1:150, 1:300, 1:600, 1:1200, and 1:2400) were applied to polystyrene plates precoated with biotinylated dsDNA via streptavidin. Mouse sera (1:250) mixed with calf thymus dsDNA (final DNA concentration ranging in doubling dilution from 1 to 0.0625 mg/ml) or PBS (controls) were incubated (37 °C, 3 h) and applied to the polystyrene plates precoated with p185(378–394) via streptavidin. Purified cardiolipin and lysozyme were obtained commercially. The 96-well microtiter plates were coated with cardiolipin (50 μg/ml in ethanol, dried overnight, 4 °C) or lysozyme (5 μg/ml in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, overnight, 4 °C). The plates were blocked (PBS plus 10% FCS, 1 h, 37 °C), and the mouse sera were applied (1:150, 1 h, 37 °C). The binding was detected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibody to the mouse Fc region. The binding of serum antibodies to the dsDNA polar body of Crithidia lucilae (Biodiagnostics, Worcestershire, UK) was determined by indirect immunofluorescent assay (11Kumar S. Kalsi J.

For the anti-DNA ELISA, kidney homogenates prepared in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (0.45 g of tissue per 2 ml of PBS-Tween) were spun in a microcentrifuge (14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 1 h), and the supernatants were filtered (0.22 μm) and applied to polystyrene plates precoated with goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific) (250 μl/well, overnight, 4 °C) and blocked (10% FCS in PBS-Tween, 37 °C, 2 h). Plates were washed (six times, PBS-Tween), treated with DNase I (Type IV, 37 °C, 1 h) washed again (six times, PBS-Tween), and treated with 2 m NaCl (37 °C, three washes of 30 min each) to remove any substances bound nonspecifically by charge interactions to the immunoglobulins. Plates were washed (six times, PBS-Tween), and biotinylated dsDNA was applied (1 μg/ml, 37 °C, 1 h). Binding of the dsDNA to the captured kidney immunoglobulins was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. Four-micrometer-thick renal sections using frozen kidneys from mice immunized with peptide-MAP or MAP backbone alone were cut and stained with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:40; Southern Biotechnology; room temperature, 30 min). The slides were washed in PBS, mounted in 10% glycerol, and viewed under UV light (filter set at 530 nm) using an MRC 600 scanning system connected to image analysis software (Bio-Rad). Sera from SLE Patients and Healthy Individuals were obtained as follows. Thirty-nine sera from SLE patients with known clinical history and 20 sera from normal healthy individuals (controls) were analyzed for the presence of the reactivity against p185(378–394). The female/male ratios in the two groups were as follows: 35:4 and 20:0 (controls). The ages (mean ± S.D., years) of the patients in the three groups were as follows: 36.47 ± 12.46 and 40.15 ± 8.8 (controls). For the anti-peptide antibody ELISA to detect the anti-p185(378–394) activity of human lupus serum IgG, p185(378–394) and a control peptide of similar length (p185(1238–1255), KGTPTAENPEYLGLDVPV; Alta Bioscience, Birmingham, UK) with N terminus biotin conjugation were utilized. The serum anti-p185(378–394) activity was determined using the ELISAs. The polystyrene plates were coated (4 °C, overnight) with streptavidin (5 μg/ml, half of the wells). The two biotinylated peptides (p185(378–394) and p185(1238–1255)) were applied to the streptavidin-coated wells (5 μg/ml, 1 h, 37 °C). The plate was then blocked (2% each casein and BSA in PBS, 1 h, 37 °C), and sera (1:300, diluted in the casein-BSA blocker) were applied in duplicate. The binding of serum IgG was evaluated using a monoclonal anti-human IgG antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. Optical density was measured at 405 nm. Preparation of Intact p185 was as follows. The p185-overexpressing SKBR-3 cell line was obtained from the Cell Line Resource of the Institute of Cancer Research (London, UK). SKBR-3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (containing glutamine; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and allowed to reach confluence. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C) and lysed using n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (30 mm) (34Gould R.J. Ginsberg B.H. Spector A.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6776-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was dialyzed against PBS and centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant supplemented with glycerol (10% of final concentration) was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. The amount of protein was determined using Lowry's method (56Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). The cell extract was stored at −20 °C. The serum reactivity to the intact p185 molecule was determined using an ELISA. The polystyrene plates were coated (1 μg/ml, 4 °C, overnight) with a mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma/Genosys, Cambridge, UK) to the cytoplasmic domain (residues 1238–1255) of p185. The SKBR-3 cell extract was applied to half of the wells (10 μg/ml, 1 h, 37 °C). The plate was then blocked (2% each casein and BSA in PBS, 1 h, 37 °C). Two sera earlier determined to possess anti-p185(378–394) activity, one representative of immunized mice and one human (serum number 23) (1:300, diluted in the casein-BSA blocker) were applied in duplicate to p185-coated or non-coated wells. The above described mouse and human sera (1:250) mixed with calf thymus dsDNA (final DNA concentration ranging in doubling dilution from 0.5 to 0.125 mg/ml) or PBS (controls), were incubated (37 °C, 3 h) and applied to the polystyrene plates precoated as described above, with intact p185. The binding of serum IgG was evaluated using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or monoclonal anti-human IgG antibody. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise mentioned. Polystyrene plates (Maxisorp) were purchased from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark). Moα-HL was from Immunostics (London, UK). Only B3 exhibited significant anti-p185(378–394) activity (Fig. 1a). The anti-p185(378–394) activity of hybrid Fab BU containing B3 light chain and UK4 heavy chain was comparable with that of BB. The anti-p185(378–394) activity of BB was inhibited in the presence of dsDNA in an inhibitor concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1b). Both of the DNA-binding proteins (Pa-UDG, Fig. 2a; Tgo, Fig. 2c) tested, especially Pa-UDG, exhibited significant binding to the peptide. These reactivities were inhibited by dsDNA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, b and d). BALB/c mice immunized with p185(378–394) peptide mixed with saline (Fig. 3, a and c) or FCA (Fig. 3, b and d), developed significant titers of IgG anti-dsDNA antibodies (Fig. 3, a and d) as determined by traditional (Fig. 3, a and b) or a novel pull-down (Fig. 3, c and d) anti-dsDNA antibody ELISA. Although both of the immunoassays yielded consistent results, the pull-down ELISA was observed to be more sensitive, yielding significantly higher OD values. The mice also developed significant titers of IgG anti-ssDNA and anti-peptide antibodies (Fig. 3, a and b). Although the antibody titers were relatively higher in mice that received peptide with CFA compared with those receiving the peptide in saline on day 30, the titers of the two groups were generally comparable on day 74. The mice also developed low titers of anti-cardiolipin antibodies; however, none of the sera exhibited convincing reactivity to lysozyme that was used as a negative antigen control (Fig. 4a). Four representative sera, two from each group of mice (receiving peptide in Freund's adjuvant or in saline), were further analyzed in the inhibition assays; the sera exhibited a decrease in their binding to dsDNA in a concentration-dependent manner when applied in doubling dilutions (Fig. 4, b and c). Interestingly, the anti-peptide and anti-dsDNA activities exhibited a similar pattern of antigen reactivity when plotted in a decreasing order of anti-peptide activities of the sera (Fig. 4d), indicating that the two activities were associated. The anti-peptide activities in the four sera were inhibited by dsDNA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5, a–c). The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies could be detected in the extracts of the kidneys only of the mice immunized with the peptide (Fig. 4d). The sera from the mice immunized with the peptide and not those from the control mice receiving MAP backbone alone also reacted with dsDNA in Crithidia assays, and immunoglobulin deposition was present in renal glomeruli only from these mice (data not shown). Two (serum numbers 23 and 31) of the 39 human sera from the patients with lupus but none of the 20 sera from healthy individuals possessed significant reactivity to p185(378–394) (Fig. 6a). None of the 59 sera possessed convincing reactivity to the control peptide (Fig. 6b). One of the representative sera from mice exhibiting anti-p185(378–394) activity and the human lupus serum number 23 were further analyzed for their ability to recognize the intact p185 molecule derived from SKBR3 cells. Both of these sera bound the intact p185 (Fig. 6c), and this reactivity was inhibited by dsDNA (Fig. 6d).FIGURE 2Binding of p185(378–394) peptide to the DNA repair enzyme Pa-UDG (a) or DNA polymerase Tgo (c) in its doubling dilutions starting from 80 μg/ml.
