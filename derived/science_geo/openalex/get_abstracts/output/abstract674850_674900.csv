https://openalex.org/W3164260036,"Ionizing radiation causes DNA damage and is a mainstay for cancer treatment, but understanding of its genomic impact is limited. We analyzed mutational spectra following radiotherapy in 190 paired primary and recurrent gliomas from the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis Consortium and 3,693 post-treatment metastatic tumors from the Hartwig Medical Foundation. We identified radiotherapy-associated significant increases in the burden of small deletions (5-15 bp) and large deletions (20+ bp to chromosome-arm length). Small deletions were characterized by a larger span size, lacking breakpoint microhomology and were genomically more dispersed when compared to pre-existing deletions and deletions in non-irradiated tumors. Mutational signature analysis implicated classical non-homologous end-joining-mediated DNA damage repair and APOBEC mutagenesis following radiotherapy. A high radiation-associated deletion burden was associated with worse clinical outcomes, suggesting that effective repair of radiation-induced DNA damage is detrimental to patient survival. These results may be leveraged to predict sensitivity to radiation therapy in recurrent cancer."

Therefore, this study aimed at assessing depression, anxiety, stress and identifying their associated factors among university students in Ethiopia during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We invited students to complete an online survey using Google forms comprising consent, socio-demographic characteristics, and the standard validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire. After completion of the survey from June 30 to July 30, 2020, we exported the data into SPSS 22. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were computed. Associated factors were identified using binary logistic regression and variables with a p-value &lt;0.05 were declared as statistically significant factors with the outcome variables. Results A total of 423 students completed the online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in this study was 46.3%, 52%, and 28.6%, respectively. In the multivariable model, female sex, poor self-efficacy to prevent COVID-19, those who do not read any material about COVID-19 prevention, lack of access to reading materials about their profession, and lack of access to uninterrupted internet access were significantly associated with depression. Female sex, lower ages, students with non-health-related departments, those who do not think that COVID-19 is preventable, and those who do not read any materials about COVID-19 prevention were significantly associated with anxiety. Whereas, being female, students attending 1 st and 2 nd years, those who do not think that COVID-19 is preventable, presence of confirmed COVID-19 patient at the town they are living in, and lack of access to reading materials about their profession were significantly associated with stress. Conclusions Depression, anxiety, and stress level among University students calls for addressing these problems by controlling the modifiable factors identified and promoting psychological wellbeing of students."
https://openalex.org/W3164147480,"Significant losses can occur for various smart grid stake holders due to the Power Quality Disturbances (PQDs). Therefore, it is necessary to correctly recognize and timely mitigate the PQDs. In this context, an emerging trend is the development of machine learning assisted PQDs management. Based on the conventional processing theory, the existing PQDs identification is time-invariant. It can result in a huge amount of unnecessary information being collected, processed, and transmitted. Consequently, needless processing activities, power consumption and latency can occur. In this paper, a novel combination of signal-piloted acquisition, adaptive-rate segmentation and time-domain features extraction with machine learning tools is suggested. The signal-piloted acquisition and processing brings real-time compression. Therefore, a remarkable reduction can be secured in the data storage, processing and transmission requirement towards the post classifier. Additionally, a reduced computational cost and latency of classifier is promised. The classification is accomplished by using robust machine learning algorithms. A comparison is made among the k-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes, Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine. Multiple metrics are used to test the success of classification. It permits to avoid any biasness of findings. The applicability of the suggested approach is studied for automated recognition of the power signal's major voltage and transient disturbances. Results show that the system attains a 6.75-fold reduction in the collected information and the processing load and secures the 98.05% accuracy of classification."
https://openalex.org/W3165295777,"In ovoid-shaped, Gram-positive bacteria, MapZ guides FtsZ-ring positioning at cell equators. The cell wall of the ovococcus Streptococcus mutans contains peptidoglycan decorated with serotype c carbohydrates (SCCs). In the present study, we identify the major cell separation autolysin AtlA as an SCC-binding protein. AtlA binding to SCC is attenuated by the glycerol phosphate (GroP) modification. Using fluorescently labeled AtlA constructs, we mapped SCC distribution on the streptococcal surface, revealing enrichment of GroP-deficient immature SCCs at the cell poles and equators. The immature SCCs co-localize with MapZ at the equatorial rings throughout the cell cycle. In GroP-deficient mutants, AtlA is mislocalized, resulting in dysregulated cellular autolysis. These mutants display morphological abnormalities associated with MapZ mislocalization, leading to FtsZ-ring misplacement. Altogether, our data support a model in which maturation of a cell wall polysaccharide provides the molecular cues for the recruitment of cell division machinery, ensuring proper daughter cell separation and FtsZ-ring positioning. Glycerol phosphate modifications of cell wall carbohydrates localize regulators of cell division in Streptococcus mutans."

Methods Adults (n = 369; 236 females) aged 65–74 years living independently were recruited from the cross-sectional Researching Eating Activity and Cognitive Health (REACH) study. Body fat percentage and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) (sum of lean mass in the arms and legs) were assessed using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (Hologic, QDR Discovery A). The ASM index was calculated by ASM (kilograms) divided by height (meters) squared. Isometric grip strength was measured using a hand grip strength dynamometer (JAMAR HAND). Results Linear regression analyses revealed that muscle strength was positively associated with the ASM index (R 2 = 0.431, p &lt; 0.001). When exploring associations between muscle strength and muscle mass according to obesity classifications (obesity ≥30% males; ≥40% females), muscle mass was a significant predictor of muscle strength in non-obese participants. However, in participants with obesity, muscle mass was no longer a significant predictor of muscle strength. Conclusions Body fat percentage should be considered when measuring associations between muscle mass and muscle strength in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W3165066364,"Human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) obtained from women affected by gestational diabetes (GD-HUVECs) display durable pro-atherogenic modifications and might be considered a valid in vitro model for studying chronic hyperglycemia effects on early endothelial senescence. Here, we demonstrated that GD- compared to C-HUVECs (controls) exhibited oxidative stress, altered both mitochondrial membrane potential and antioxidant response, significant increase of senescent cells characterized by a reduced NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) activity together with an increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (P16), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1 (P21), and tumor protein p53 (P53) acetylation. This was associated with the p300 activation, and its silencing significantly reduced the GD-HUVECs increased protein levels of P300 and Ac-P53 thus indicating a persistent endothelial senescence via SIRT1/P300/P53/P21 pathway. Overall, our data suggest that GD-HUVECs can represent an “endothelial hyperglycemic memory” model to investigate in vitro the early endothelium senescence in cells chronically exposed to hyperglycemia in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3165292665,"Background Since the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic, countries have been mirroring each other’s policies to mitigate the spread of the virus. Whether current measures alone will lead to behavioral change such as social distancing, washing hands, and wearing a facemask is not well understood. The objective of this study is to better understand individual variation in behavioral responses to COVID-19 by exploring the influence of beliefs, motivations and policy measures on public health behaviors. We do so by comparing The Netherlands and Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium. Methods and findings Our final sample included 2,637 respondents from The Netherlands and 1,678 from Flanders. The data was nationally representative along three dimensions: age, gender, and household income in both countries. Our key outcome variables of interest were beliefs about policy effectiveness; stated reasons for complying with public rules; and changes in behavior. For control variables, we included a number of measures of how severe the respondent believed Covid-19 to be and a number of negative side effects that the person may have experienced: loneliness, boredom, anxiety, and conflicts with friends and neighbors. Finally, we controlled for socio-demographic factors: age, gender, income (categorical), education (categorical) and the presence of Covid-19 risk factors (diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, allergies). The dependent variable for each of the estimation models is dichotomous, so we used Probit models to predict the probability of engaging in a given behavior. We found that motivations, beliefs about the effectiveness of measures, and pre-pandemic behavior play an important role. The Dutch were more likely to wash their hands than the Flemish (15.4%, p&lt;0.01), visit family (15.5%, p &lt; .01), run errands (12.0%, p&lt;0.05) or go to large closed spaces such as a shopping mall (21.2%, p&lt;0.01). The Dutch were significantly less likely to wear a mask (87.6%, p&lt;0.01). We also found that beliefs about the virus, psychological effects of the virus, as well as pre-pandemic behavior play a role in adherence to recommendations. Conclusions Our results suggest that policymakers should consider behavioral motivations specific to their country in their COVID-19 strategies. In addition, the belief that a policy is effective significantly increased the probability of the behavior, so policy measures should be accompanied by public health campaigns to increase adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3165846701,"Background The global pandemic of Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has plunged the world into both social and economic disarray, with vaccines still emerging and a continued paucity of personal protective equipment; the pandemic has also highlighted the potential for rapid emergence of aggressive respiratory pathogens and the need for preparedness. Avian immunoglobulins (IgY) have been previously shown in animal models to protect against new infection and mitigate established infection when applied intranasally. We carried out a proof-of-concept study to address the feasibility of using such antibodies as mucosally-applied prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. Methods Hens were immunized with recombinant S1 spike glycoprotein of the virus, and the resulting IgY was evaluated for binding specificity, inhibition of glycoprotein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein (the requisite binding site for the virus), and inhibition of viral replication in Vero cell culture. Results Titers of anti-S1 glycoprotein IgY were evident in yolks at 14 days post-immunization, peaking at 21 days, and at peak concentrations of 16.8 mg/ml. IgY showed strong and significant inhibition of S1/ACE2 binding interactions, and significantly inhibited viral replication at a concentration of 16.8 mg/ml. Four weeks’ collection from eggs of two hens produced a total of 1.55 grams of IgY. Conclusions In this proof-of-concept study we showed that avian immunoglobulins (IgY) raised against a key virulence factor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus successfully inhibited the critical initial adhesion of viral spike glycoproteins to human ACE2 protein receptors and inhibited viral replication in vitro , in a short period using only two laying hens. We conclude that production of large amounts of IgY inhibiting viral binding and replication of SARS-CoV-2 is feasible, and that incorporation of this or similar material into an intranasal spray and/or other mucosal protecting products may be effective at reducing infection and spread of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3164476706,"Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes are prolific vectors of arboviruses that are a global threat to human and animal health. Increased globalization and ease of travel have facilitated the worldwide dissemination of these mosquitoes and the viruses they transmit. To assess disease risk, we determined the frequency of arboviruses in western Kenyan counties bordering an area of high arboviral activity. In addition to pathogenic viruses, insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs), some of which are thought to impair the transmission of specific pathogenic arboviruses, were also evaluated. We trapped mosquitoes in the short and long rainy seasons in 2018 and 2019 at livestock markets and hospitals. Mosquitoes were screened for dengue, chikungunya and other human pathogenic arboviruses, ISFs, and their blood-meal sources as determined by high-resolution melting analysis of (RT-)PCR products. Of 6,848 mosquitoes collected, 89% were trapped during the long rainy season, with A. aegypti (59%) and Cx. pipiens sensu lato (40%) being the most abundant. Most blood-fed mosquitoes were Cx. pipiens s.l. with blood-meals from humans, chicken, and sparrow (Passer sp.). We did not detect dengue or chikungunya viruses. However, one Culex poicilipes female was positive for Sindbis virus, 30 pools of Ae. aegypti had cell fusing agent virus (CFAV; infection rate (IR) = 1.27%, 95% CI = 0.87%-1.78%); 11 pools of Ae. aegypti had Aedes flavivirus (AeFV; IR = 0.43%, 95% CI = 0.23%-0.74%); and seven pools of Cx. pipiens s.l. (IR = 0.23%, 95% CI = 0.1%-0.45%) and one pool of Culex annulioris had Culex flavivirus. Sindbis virus, which causes febrile illness in humans, can complicate the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with fever. The presence of Sindbis virus in a single mosquito from a population of mosquitoes with ISFs calls for further investigation into the role ISFs may play in blocking transmission of other arboviruses in this region."
https://openalex.org/W3165726771,"Osteoarthritis is a progressive degenerative joint disease which is high prevalent in dogs. In the late stage of the disease, it determines chronic neuropathic pain which leads to reduced quality-of-life in affected patients. To date it has not yet been identified a specific treatment, but it has been proved that nutraceutical and dietary supplements may play an important role in controlling inflammation and pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate, by the use of force plate gait analysis, the clinical efficacy of Boswellia and Curcuvet® combined with conventional nutraceutical therapy compared with conventional nutraceutical alone in dogs affected by osteoarthritis.Twenty client-owned dogs, over 12 months old and 20 kg of body-weight, with a confirmed diagnosis of Osteoarthritis, were included in this randomized, double-blinded study. The dogs were randomly divided into two groups: the first group (A) received a conventional nutraceutical (consisted in a preparation of glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, fish-oil containing 80% of omega 3-fatty acid, vitamin C and E, saccharomyces Cerevisiae) with a combination of acid boswellic and Curcuvet®, while the second group (B) received a conventional nutraceutical. All the enrolled dogs underwent a washout period before starting the treatment with nutraceuticals products which were the only admitted treatment over the study period. A full orthopaedic and neurologic examination, and force plate gait analysis were performed before starting the treatment, at 45, 90, and 60 days post-treatment. Ground reaction forces were recorded and analyzed.Twenty dogs were enrolled in the study. In both groups there was an increasing values of ground reaction forces. These results might indicate that both nutraceutical products determined a better condition in terms of pain feeling but that effect is much more visible after 60 days from the end of the administration in treated group.In conclusion Curcuvet in combination with Boswellic acid could be considered a valid aid in a multimodal treatment for canine osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W3165741751,"Molecular recognition is a fundamental principle in biological systems. The olfactory detection of both food and predators via ecological relevant odorant cues are abilities of eminent evolutionary significance for many species. Pyrazines are such volatile cues, some of which act as both human-centered key food odorants (KFOs) and semiochemicals. A pyrazine-selective odorant receptor has been elusive. Here we screened 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, a KFO and semiochemical, and 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, an innate fear-associated non-KFO, against 616 human odorant receptor variants, in a cell-based luminescence assay. OR5K1 emerged as sole responding receptor. Tested against a comprehensive collection of 178 KFOs, we newly identified 18 pyrazines and (2R/2S)-4-methoxy-2,5-dimethylfuran-3(2H)-one as agonists. Notably, OR5K1 orthologs in mouse and domesticated species displayed a human-like, potency-ranked activation pattern of pyrazines, suggesting a domestication-led co-evolution of OR5K1 and its orthologs. In summary, OR5K1 is a specialized olfactory receptor across mammals for the detection of pyrazine-based key food odors and semiochemicals."
https://openalex.org/W3164477027,"Chronic pain affects 50 million Americans and is often treated with non-pharmacologic approaches like physical therapy. Developing a no-show prediction model for individuals seeking physical therapy care for musculoskeletal conditions has several benefits including enhancement of workforce efficiency without growing the existing provider pool, delivering guideline adherent care, and identifying those that may benefit from telehealth. The objective of this paper was to quantify the national prevalence of no-shows for patients seeking physical therapy care and to identify individual and organizational factors predicting whether a patient will be a no-show when seeking physical therapy care.Retrospective cohort study.Commercial provider of physical therapy within the United States with 828 clinics across 26 states.Adolescent and adult patients (age cutoffs: 14-117 years) seeking non-pharmacological treatment for musculoskeletal conditions from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017 (n = 542,685). Exclusion criteria were a primary complaint not considered an MSK condition or improbable values for height, weight, or body mass index values. The study included 444,995 individuals.Prevalence of no-shows for musculoskeletal conditions and predictors of patient no-show.In our population, 73% missed at least 1 appointment for a given physical therapy care episode. Our model had moderate discrimination for no-shows (c-statistic:0.72, all appointments; 0.73, first 7 appointments) and was well calibrated, with predicted and observed no-shows in good agreement. Variables predicting higher no-show rates included insurance type; smoking-status; higher BMI; and more prior cancellations, time between visit and scheduling date, and between current and previous visit.The high prevalence of no-shows when seeking care for musculoskeletal conditions from physical therapists highlights an inefficiency that, unaddressed, could limit delivery of guideline-adherent care that advocates for earlier use of non-pharmacological treatments for musculoskeletal conditions and result in missed opportunities for using telehealth to deliver physical therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3165212091,"Prior studies have reported inconsistent findings with regard to the effects of small-group student talk on developing individual students’ English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) writing ability. To further explore the question under discussion, we designed a quasi-experimental study that included a pretest, a posttest, and a delayed posttest, and implemented it in two English-major groups at a university in China. We randomly assigned the students to an intervention group and a comparison group to investigate whether employing structured small-group student talk as collaborative prewriting discussions would effectively facilitate individual students’ EFL writing development and whether such effects could be retained. The immediate and sustained effects after the quasi-experimental study was completed were measured by the analytic scores on five components of the writing task (content, organization, vocabulary, language, and mechanics) and the holistic writing scores cumulated of all these components. Statistical analyses revealed that the two groups were significantly distinguished by their analytic and holistic scores, indicating that students in the intervention group outperformed their comparison group peers in writing performance. The effects of collaborative prewriting discussions in the form of structured small-group student talk were found statistically significant in facilitating students’ writing improvement in the content, organization, vocabulary, and language use, but not mechanics. The effects on content, organization, and vocabulary were retained as seen from the delayed posttest, while those on language use were not. The comparison group showed little improvement in their writing performance across the three tests. We concluded this study with a discussion on the implications for English-as-a-second/foreign-language (L2) writing instruction."
https://openalex.org/W3164823338,"Accurate computation of joint angles from optical marker data using inverse kinematics methods requires that the locations of markers on a model match the locations of experimental markers on participants. Marker registration is the process of positioning the model markers so that they match the locations of the experimental markers. Markers are typically registered using a graphical user interface (GUI), but this method is subjective and may introduce errors and uncertainty to the calculated joint angles and moments. In this investigation, we use OpenSim to isolate and quantify marker registration-based error from other sources of error by analyzing the gait of a bipedal humanoid robot for which segment geometry, mass properties, and joint angles are known. We then propose a marker registration method that is informed by the orientation of anatomical reference frames derived from surface-mounted optical markers as an alternative to user registration using a GUI. The proposed orientation registration method reduced the average root-mean-square error in both joint angles and joint moments by 67% compared to the user registration method, and eliminated variability among users. Our results show that a systematic method for marker registration that reduces subjective user input can make marker registration more accurate and repeatable."
https://openalex.org/W3165616174,"The economic valuation of ecosystem services in part reflects the desire to use conventional economic tools (markets and economic instruments) to conserve ecosystem services. However, for regulating and supporting ecosystem services that depend on ecosystem structure and function, estimation of economic value requires estimates of the current level of underlying ecological functions first. This primary step is in principle, the job of environmental scientists, not economists. Here, we provide a coarse-level quantitative assessment of the relationship between the research effort expended by environmental scientists (on the biophysical values) and economists (on the monetary values) on 15 different regulating and supporting services in 32 ecosystem types using peer-reviewed article hits retrieved from bibliographic databases as a measure of research effort. We find a positive, moderately strong (r = 0.69) correlation between research efforts in the two domains, a result that, while encouraging, is likely to reflect serendipity rather than the deliberate design of integrated environmental science-economics research programs. Our results suggest that compared to environmental science research effort economic valuation is devoted to a smaller, less diverse set of ecosystem services but a broader, more diverse, set of ecosystem types. The two domains differed more with respect to the ecosystem services that are the major focus of research effort than they did with respect to the ecosystem types of principal research interest. For example, carbon sequestration, erosion regulation, and nutrient cycling receive more relative research effort in the environmental sciences; air quality regulation in economic valuations. For both domains, cultivated areas, wetlands, and urban/semi-urban ecosystem types received relatively large research effort, while arctic and mountain tundra, cave and subterranean, cryosphere, intertidal/littoral zone, and kelp forest ecosystem types received negligible research effort. We suggest ways and means by which the field of sustainability science may be improved by the design and implementation of a searchable database of environmental science and economic valuation literature as well as a global ecosystem service research network and repository that explicitly links research on the estimation and prediction of biophysical ecosystem functions with that of the social sciences and other knowledge systems. These suggestions would, at least in principle, facilitate a more efficient research agenda between economists and environmental scientists and aid management, regulatory and judicial decision-makers."
https://openalex.org/W3164068269,"This paper empirically examines whether there is an association between financial reporting disclosure quality and sustainability disclosure quality of the top 100 socially reputed Chinese listed firms. The paper computed financial disclosure quality by empirically combining earning qualities of accrual, persistence, predictability, and smoothness. Using content analysis and survey questionnaire research methods, it calculated sustainability quality by combining disclosure quantity (through quantitative weightings), disclosure type (through qualitative weightings), and disclosure item importance (through qualitative weightings) of economic, social, and environmental disclosures made in annual and sustainability reports, ascertained using the Global Reporting Initiative sustainability framework. The study finds that sustainability disclosure in the current period is sufficiently associated with financial disclosure quality of the current period and future period. Consistent with stakeholder theory, firms with a social reputation are perceived as trustworthy by stakeholders and shareholders. The findings lead to a cultural stakeholder theory where underlying values of societal culture create a condition supporting mutual stakeholder relationships between firm and various stakeholders. Demonstrating trustworthiness through disclosures can help boost consumer confidence and foreign trade relations for Chinese firms. The Chinese government can design innovative schemes to reward and promote trustworthiness in firms, such as regulating base-point reductions in interest rates on borrowing or raising funds."
https://openalex.org/W3165390869,"Dengue is an endemic disease in Colombia. Norte de Santander is a region on the border of Colombia and Venezuela and has reported the co-circulation and simultaneous co-infection of different serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV). This study aimed to conduct a phylogenetic analysis on the origin and genetic diversity of DENV strains circulating in this bordering region. Serum samples were collected from patients who were clinically diagnosed with febrile syndrome associated with dengue during two periods. These samples were tested for DENV and serotyping was performed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Subsequently, positive samples were amplified and the envelope protein gene of DENV was sequenced. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses were performed using the sequences obtained. Basic local alignment search tool analysis confirmed that six and eight sequences belonged to DENV-1 and DENV-2, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of DENV-1 showed that the sequences belonged to genotype V and clade I; they formed two groups: in the first group, two sequences showed a close phylogenetic relationship with strains from Ecuador and Panama, whereas the other four sequences were grouped with strains from Venezuela and Colombia. In the case of DENV-2, the analysis revealed that the sequences belonged to the Asian-American genotype and clade III. Furthermore, they formed two groups; in the first group, three sequences were grouped with strains from Colombia and Venezuela, whereas the other five were grouped with strains from Venezuela, Colombia and Honduras. This phylogenetic analysis suggests that the geographical proximity between Colombia and Venezuela is favourable for the export and import of different strains among serotypes or clades of the same DENV serotype, which could favour the spread of new outbreaks caused by new strains or genetic variants of this arbovirus. Therefore, this information highlights the importance of monitoring the transmission of DENV at border regions."
https://openalex.org/W3164248669,"While a substantial amount of literature addresses the relationship between natural resources and economic growth, relatively little is known regarding the relationship between natural resource endowment and health at the population level. We construct a 5-year cross-country panel to assess the impact of natural resource rents on changes in life expectancy at birth as a proxy indicator for population health during the period 1970-2015. To estimate the causal effects of interest, we use global commodity prices as instrumental variables for natural resource rent incomes in two-stage-least squares regressions. Controlling for country and year fixed effects, we show that each standard deviation increase in resource rents results in life expectancy increase of 6.72% (CI: 2.01%, 11.44%). This corresponds to approximately one additional year of life expectancy gained over five years. We find a larger positive effect of rents on life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared to other world regions. We do not find short-term effects of rents on economic growth, but show that increases in resource rents result in sizeable increases in government revenues in the short run, which likely translate into increased spending across government sectors. This suggests that natural resources can help governments finance health and other development-oriented programs needed to improve population health."
https://openalex.org/W3164272590,"The aim of our research was to investigate the influence of the situational context of presenting contemporary critical artworks (in an art gallery vs in a laboratory setting) and the way in which one is acquainted with contextual information, i.e. a curatorial description (reading it on one’s own vs listening to it vs a lack of curatorial information), on the reception of critical art. All experimental stimuli were exemplars of contemporary art which raise current controversial social and political issues. Non-experts in the field of art were asked to rate their emotional reactions on non-verbal scales and estimate their liking and understanding of the artworks. As predicted, the art gallery context increased both the experience of aesthetic emotions–in terms of valence, arousal, subjective significance, and dominance and aesthetic judgements–in terms of liking. Thus, for critical art (i.e. current artworks which critically address serious, up-to-date issues) the situational context of the gallery increased the aesthetic experience–which is in line with previous studies on the gallery (or museum) effect. Curatorial information increased understanding, so non-experts seem to need interpretative guidance in the reception of critical art. Subjective significance was higher in the reading of curatorial information condition than the listening to curatorial information condition or the control condition (a lack of curatorial information). It seems, therefore, that art non-experts have a better understanding of critical art after being exposed to the curatorial description, but this does not result in an increase in liking and aesthetic emotions. Probably this is because the curatorial description allows one to grasp the difficult, often unpleasant issue addressed by critical art."
https://openalex.org/W3164328274,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening disease of pregnant women associated with severe hypertension, proteinuria, or multi-organ injuries. Mitochondrial-mediated placental oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PE. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be revealed. Here, we identify Rnd3, a small Rho GTPase, regulating placental mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). We showed that Rnd3 is down-regulated in primary trophoblasts isolated from PE patients. Loss of Rnd3 in trophoblasts resulted in excessive ROS generation, cell apoptosis, mitochondrial injury, and proton leakage from the respiratory chain. Moreover, Rnd3 overexpression partially rescues the mitochondrial defects and oxidative stress in human PE primary trophoblasts. Rnd3 physically interacts with the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and promotes the PPARγ-mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) cascade. Forced expression of PPARγ rescues deficiency of Rnd3-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that Rnd3 acts as a novel protective factor in placental mitochondria through PPARγ-UCP2 signaling and highlight that downregulation of Rnd3 is a potential factor involved in PE pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3165023451,"City air quality monitoring (AQM) network are typically sparsely distributed due to high operation costs. It is of the question of how well it can reflect public health risks to air pollution given the diversity and heterogeneity in pollution, and spatial variations in population density. Combing high-resolution air quality model, spatial population distribution and health risk factors, we proposed a population-health based metric for AQM representativeness. This metric was demonstrated in Hong Kong using hourly modelling data of PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and O3 in 2019 with grid cells of 45m * 48m. Individual and total hospital admission risks (%AR) of these pollutants were calculated for each cell, and compared with those calculated at 16 monitoring sites using the similarity frequency (SF) method. AQM Representativeness was evaluated by SF and a population-health based network representation index (PHNI), which is population-weighted SF over the study-domain. The representativeness varies substantially among sites as well as between population- and area-based evaluation methods, reflecting heterogeneity in pollution and population. The current AQM network reflects population health risks well for PM10 (PHNI = 0.87) and PM2.5 (PHNI = 0.82), but is less able to represent risks for NO2 (PHNI = 0.59) and O3 (PHNI = 0.78). Strong seasonal variability in PHNI was found for PM, increasing by >11% during autumn and winter compared to summer due to regional transport. NO2 is better represented in urban than rural, reflecting the heterogeneity of urban traffic pollution. Combined health risk (%ARtotal) is well represented by the current AQM network (PHNI = 1), which is more homogenous due to the dominance and anti-correlation of NO2 and O3 related %AR. The proposed PHNI metric is useful to compare the health risk representativeness of AQM for individual and multiple pollutants and can be used to compare the effectiveness of AQM across cities."
https://openalex.org/W3165845924,"In primary health care, multi-stakeholder partnerships between clinicians, policy makers, academic representatives and other stakeholders to improve service delivery are becoming more common. Literature on processes and approaches that enhance partnership effectiveness is growing. However, evidence on the performance of the measures of partnership functioning and the achievement of desired outcomes is still limited, due to the field's definitional ambiguity and the challenges inherent in measuring complex and evolving collaborative processes. Reliable measures are needed for external or self-assessment of partnership functioning, as intermediate steps in the achievement of desired outcomes. We adapted the Partnership Self-Assessment Tool (PSAT) and distributed it to multiple stakeholders within five partnerships in Canada and Australia. The instrument contained a number of partnership functioning sub-scales. New sub-scales were developed for the domains of communication and external environment. Partnership synergy was assessed using modified Partnership Synergy Processes and Partnership Synergy Outcomes sub-scales, and a combined Partnership Synergy scale. Ranking by partnership scores was compared with independent ranks based on a qualitative evaluation of the partnerships' development. 55 (90%) questionnaires were returned. Our results indicate that the instrument was capable of discriminating between different levels of dimensions of partnership functioning and partnership synergy even in a limited sample. The sub-scales were sufficiently reliable to have the capacity to discriminate between individuals, and between partnerships. There was negligible difference in the correlations between different partnership functioning dimensions and Partnership Synergy sub-scales. The Communication and External Environment sub-scales did not perform well metrically. The adapted partnership assessment tool is suitable for assessing the achievement of partnership synergy and specific indicators of partnership functioning. Further development of Communication and External Environment sub-scales is warranted. The instrument could be applied to assess internal partnership performance on key indicators across settings, in order to determine if the collaborative process is working well."
https://openalex.org/W3164078283,"Although the Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica is well studied throughout its temperate and low Arctic breeding range, few have studied the species in its far northern distribution. This study is the first to present data on the migratory movements of the ""large-billed"" subspecies, F. a. naumanni, that breeds in the high Arctic and which has significantly larger body size than those farther south. During 2013-2015, migration tracks were collected from nine adult puffins (6 males and 3 females) tagged with geolocators in northwest Greenland. Overall, female puffins traveled farther than males on their annual migration, with one female puffin traveling over 13,600 km, which was nearly a third farther than any tagged male in our study. Differential migration was observed in migratory phenology and route, with males using a form of chain migration with acute synchrony between individuals while females appeared to largely use leap-frog migration and showed little synchrony between individuals. Extreme sexual segregation in wintering areas was evidenced by two females that migrated to the southern limit of the species' range while the six males remained at the northern limit, and wintered along the sea ice edge during portions of the non-breeding season. Male puffins thus wintered in regions with sea surface temperatures up to 10° C cooler than female puffins, and in areas with generally colder sea surface temperatures when compared to previously known wintering areas of temperate and low Arctic puffin breeding populations. The degree to which body size enables male F. a. naumanni to remain in colder waters likely reflects differing life history constraints between sexes and populations (i.e., subspecies). Further study is warranted to investigate how recent changes in climate have further exacerbated the observed differences between sexes in high Arctic puffins and possibly other marine avian species."
https://openalex.org/W3164731295,"Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms have had a positive impact on biological research, leading to the development of numerous omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, and pangenomics. These analyses provide insights into the gene contents of various organisms. However, to understand the evolutionary processes of these genes, comparative analysis, which is an important tool for annotation, is required. Using comparative analysis, it is possible to infer the functions of gene contents and identify orthologs and paralogous genes via their homology. Although several comparative analysis tools currently exist, most of them are limited to complete genomes. PAN2HGENE, a computational tool that allows identification of gene products missing from the original genome sequence, with automated comparative analysis for both complete and draft genomes, can be used to address this limitation. In this study, PAN2HGENE was used to identify new products, resulting in altering the alpha value behavior in the pangenome without altering the original genomic sequence. Our findings indicate that this tool represents an efficient alternative for comparative analysis, with a simple and intuitive graphical interface. The PAN2HGENE have been uploaded to SourceForge and are available via: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pan2hgene-software."
https://openalex.org/W3164821592,"Empowerment is considered pivotal for how women access and use health care services and experience their sexual and reproductive rights. In Mozambique, women's empowerment requires a better understanding and contextualization, including looking at factors that could drive empowerment in that context. This study aims to identify socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioural determinants of different domains of women's empowerment in Mozambique.Using the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in 2015 for Mozambique, a sample of 2072 women aged between 15 and 49 years old were included in this study. The DHS's indicators of women's empowerment were used in a principal component analysis and the obtained components were identified as the domains of empowerment. Logistic regressions were run to estimate the association of socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioural characteristics with each domain of empowerment. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.Three domains of women's empowerment were identified, namely (1) Beliefs about violence against women, (2) Decision-making, and (3) Control over sexuality and safe sex. Region, rurality, the experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) and partner's controlling behaviours were associated with Beliefs about violence against women, while Decision-making and Control over sexuality and safe sex were also associated with education, age and wealth. Employment, polygamous marriage and religion was positively associated with Decision-making, and access to media increased the odds of Control over sexuality and safe sex.Women's empowerment seems to be determined by different socio-economic, demographic, and behavioural factors and this seems to be closely related to different domains of empowerment identified. This finding affirms the multi-dimensionality of empowerment as well as the importance of considering the context- and community-specific characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3165220115,"Clinically, bone destruction caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis was serious especially in patients with vitamin D (VD) deficiency. However, the role of VD in M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction remains clear. In this context, we investigate the role of VD and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction. First, we infected RAW264.7 and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (M. bovis BCG) in vitro. Then, we activated VDR through VD administration. TRAP and FAK staining, bone resorption assays, immunofluorescence staining, qPCR, and western blot were carried out. In vivo, the M. tuberculosis-induced osteolytic model on the murine skull was established and the μCT and histological analyses were performed. We found that VDR and TRAP were upregulated in bone tuberculosis tissue and proved that M. tuberculosis infection promoted osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 and BMMs. VD could inhibit osteoclasts differentiation, fusion, and bone resorption dose-dependently. However, when VDR was knocked down, the inhibitory effect of VD on osteoclasts disappeared. In mechanism, activation of VDR inhibits the phosphorylation of IκB α, thereby inhibiting NFκB signaling pathway and alleviating osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, in the skull osteolysis model, VD administration reduced osteolysis, but not in VDR−/− mice. Our study, for the first time, demonstrates that activation of VDR by VD administration inhibits M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction. Our results reveal that VD and VDR are potential therapeutic targets for M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction, and are of great clinical significance for the development of new therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3165228820,"Evaluating the performance and analyzing the cost drivers of water utilities is of great interest for water regulators and water sector managers. This study uses a quadratic cost function to investigate the existence of economies of scale and scope in the Chilean water and sewerage industry over the period 2010-2017. We also estimate and decompose productivity growth into technical change and scale efficiency change. Technical change is further broken into pure, non-neutral and scale-augmenting technical change. The results indicate that cost savings can be achieved by increases in the scale of production and the separation of water and sewerage services. Productivity progressed favorably throughout the whole period at an annual rate of 8.4%, which was attributed to the scale effect, the adoption of new technologies and a good allocation of resources. Some policy implications are finally discussed based on our findings."
https://openalex.org/W3165337679,"Accurate and precise abundance estimation is vital for informed wildlife conservation and management decision-making. Line transect surveys are a common sampling approach for abundance estimation. Distance sampling is often used to estimate abundance from line transect survey data; however, search encounter spatial capture-recapture can also be used when individuals in the population of interest are identifiable. The search encounter spatial capture-recapture model has rarely been applied, and its performance has not been compared to that of distance sampling. We analyzed simulated datasets to compare the performance of distance sampling and spatial capture-recapture abundance estimators. Additionally, we estimated the abundance of North Atlantic right whales in the southeastern United States with two formulations of each model and compared the estimates. Spatial capture-recapture abundance estimates had lower root mean squared error than distance sampling estimates. Spatial capture-recapture 95% credible intervals for abundance had nominal coverage, i.e., contained the simulating value for abundance in 95% of simulations, whereas distance sampling credible intervals had below nominal coverage. Moreover, North Atlantic right whale abundance estimates from distance sampling models were more sensitive to model specification compared to spatial capture-recapture estimates. When estimating abundance from line transect data, researchers should consider using search encounter spatial capture-recapture when individuals in the population of interest are identifiable, when line transects are surveyed over multiple occasions, when there is imperfect detection of individuals located on the line transect, and when it is safe to assume the population of interest is closed demographically. When line transects are surveyed over multiple occasions, researchers should be aware that individual space use may induce spatial autocorrelation in counts across transects. This is not accounted for in common distance sampling estimators and leads to overly precise abundance estimates."
https://openalex.org/W3164079792,"Breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). It is still unclear which DCIS will become invasive and which will remain indolent. Patients often receive surgery and radiotherapy, but this early intervention has not produced substantial decreases in late-stage disease. Sprouty proteins are important regulators of ERK/MAPK signaling and have been studied in various cancers. We hypothesized that Sprouty4 is an endogenous inhibitor of ERK/MAPK signaling and that its loss/reduced expression is a mechanism by which DCIS lesions progress toward IDC, including triple-negative disease. Using immunohistochemistry, we found reduced Sprouty4 expression in IDC patient samples compared to DCIS, and that ERK/MAPK phosphorylation had an inverse relationship to Sprouty4 expression. These observations were reproduced using a 3D culture model of disease progression. Knockdown of Sprouty4 in MCF10.DCIS cells increased ERK/MAPK phosphorylation as well as their invasive capability, while overexpression of Sprouty4 in MCF10.CA1d IDC cells reduced ERK/MAPK phosphorylation, invasion, and the aggressive phenotype exhibited by these cells. Immunofluorescence experiments revealed reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and relocation of E-cadherin back to the cell surface, consistent with the restoration of adherens junctions. To determine whether these effects were due to changes in ERK/MAPK signaling, MEK1/2 was pharmacologically inhibited in IDC cells. Nanomolar concentrations of MEK162/binimetinib restored an epithelial-like phenotype and reduced pericellular proteolysis, similar to Sprouty4 overexpression. From these data we conclude that Sprouty4 acts to control ERK/MAPK signaling in DCIS, thus limiting the progression of these premalignant breast lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3164094182,"Our aim was to determine characteristics of children with chronic critical illness (CCI) admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care children’s hospital in Turkey. The current study was a multicenter retrospective cohort study that was done from 2014 to 2017. It involved three university hospitals PICUs in which multiple criteria were set to identify pediatric CCIs. Pediatric patients staying in the ICU for at least 14 days and having at least one additional criterion, including prolonged mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, sepsis, severe wound (burn) or trauma, encephalopathy, traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, being postoperative, and neuromuscular disease, was accepted as CCI. In order to identify the newborn as a chronic critical patient, a stay in the intensive care unit for at least 30 days in addition to prematurity was required. Eight hundred eighty seven (11.14%) of the patients who were admitted to the PICU met the definition of CCI and 775 of them (87.3%) were discharged to their home. Of CCI patients, 289 (32.6%) were premature and 678 (76.4%) had prolonged mechanical ventilation. The total cost values for 2017 were statistically higher than the other years. As the length of ICU stay increased, the costs also increased. Interestingly, high incidence rates were observed for PCCI in our hospitals and these patients occupied 38.01% of the intensive care bed capacity. In conclusion, we observed that prematurity and prolonged mechanical ventilation increase the length of ICU stay, which also increased the costs. More work is needed to better understand PCCI."
https://openalex.org/W3164160253,"Background Chronic schistosomiasis is predominantly induced through up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-13. IL-13 may contribute to the disease outcomes by increasing eosinophil infiltration thereby promoting fibrosis. IL-13 may act as an immunosuppressive inflammatory cytokine that may promote carcinogenesis and also may offer protection against schistosomiasis thereby reducing risk of schistosome infections. Our study evaluated the frequency of the IL-13 rs1800925/-1112 C/ T promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among schistosomiasis infected individuals and assessed the association of the variants on IL-13 cytokine levels. We also investigated IL-13 rs1800925 polymorphisms on prostate-specific antigen levels as an indicator for risk of prostate cancer development. Methodology The study was cross-sectional and included 50 schistosomiasis infected and 316 uninfected male participants residing in Murehwa District, Zimbabwe. IL-13 rs1800925 SNPs were genotyped by allele amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction. Concentrations of serum prostate-specific antigens and plasma IL-13 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Frequencies of the genotypes CC, CT and TT, were 20%, 58% and 22% in schistosomiasis infected, and 18.3%, 62.1% and 19.6% in uninfected participants with no statistical differences. There were significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher IL-13 cytokine levels among both infected and uninfected participants with the genotypes CC and CT; median 92.25 pg/mL and 106.5 pg/mL, respectively, compared to TT variant individuals; 44.78 pg/mL. Within the schistosomiasis uninfected group, CC and CT variants had significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher IL-13 levels; median 135.0 pg/mL and 113.6 pg/mL, respectively compared to TT variant individuals; 47.15 pg/mL. Within the schistosomiasis infected group, CC, CT and TT variant individuals had insignificant differences of IL-13 level. Using logistic regression, no association was observed between prostate-specific antigen levels, IL-13 cytokine levels and IL-13 rs1800925 variants (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion IL-13 rs1800925 C variant individuals had the highest IL-13 cytokine levels among the schistosomiasis uninfected suggesting that they may be protective against Schistosoma infections. There was no association between IL-13 concentrations or IL-13 rs1800925 variants and risk of prostate cancer indicating that IL-13 levels and IL-13 rs10800925 may not be utilised as biomarker for risk of prostate cancer in schistosome infections."
https://openalex.org/W3165818196,"Objectives Social media use is associated with developing communities of practice that promote the rapid exchange of information across traditional institutional and geographical boundaries faster than previously possible. We aimed to describe and share our experience using #neoEBM (Neonatal Evidence Based Medicine) hashtag to organise and build a digital community of neonatal care practice. Materials and methods Analysis of #neoEBM Twitter data in the Symplur Signals database between 1 May 2018 to 9 January 2021. Data on tweets containing the #neoEBM hashtag were analysed using online analytical tools, including the total number of tweets and user engagement. Results Since its registration, a total of 3 228 distinct individual Twitter users used the hashtag with 23 939 tweets and 37 259 710 impressions generated. The two days with the greatest number of tweets containing #neoEBM were 8 May 2018 (n = 218) and 28 April 2019 (n = 340), coinciding with the annual Pediatric Academic Societies meeting. The majority of Twitter users made one tweet using #neoEBM (n = 1078), followed by two tweets (n = 411) and more than 10 tweets (n = 347). The number of individual impressions (views) of tweets containing #neoEBM was 37 259 710. Of the 23 939 tweets using #neoEBM, 17 817 (74%) were retweeted (shared), 15 643 (65%) included at least one link and 1 196 (5%) had at least one reply. As #neoEBM users increased over time, so did tweets containing #neoEBM, with each additional user of the hashtag associated with a mean increase in 7.8 (95% CI 7.7–8.0) tweets containing #neoEBM. Conclusion Our findings support the observation that the #neoEBM community possesses many of the characteristics of a community of practice, and it may be an effective tool to disseminate research findings. By sharing our experiences, we hope to encourage others to engage with or build online digital communities of practice to share knowledge and build collaborative networks across disciplines, institutions and countries."
https://openalex.org/W3165859105,"Early life respiratory insults, such as viral infections or hyperoxia, often increase asthma susceptibility later in life. The mechanisms underlying this increased susceptibility are not fully understood. IL-33 has been shown to be critically involved in allergic airway diseases. IL-33 expression in the neonatal lung can be increased by various respiratory insults associated with asthma development. Therefore, we investigated whether and how early life increases in IL-33 impact allergic airway responses later in life. Using a novel IL-33 transgenic mouse model, in which full-length IL-33 was inducible overexpressed in lung epithelial cells, we transiently upregulated lung IL-33 expression in neonatal mice for one week. After resting for 4-6 weeks, mice were intranasally exposed to a single-dose of recombinant IL-33 or the airborne allergen Alternaria. Alternatively, mice were exposed to Alternaria and ovalbumin multiple times for one month. We found that a transient increase in IL-33 expression during the neonatal period promoted IL-5 and IL-13 production when mice were later exposed to a single-dose of IL-33 or Alternaria in adulthood. However, increased IL-33 expression during the neonatal period did not affect airway inflammation, type 2 cytokine production, lung mucus production, or antigen-specific antibody responses when adult mice were exposed to Alternaria and ovalbumin multiple times. These results suggest that transient increased IL-33 expression early in life may have differential effects on allergic airway responses in later life, preferentially affecting allergen-induced acute type 2 cytokine production."
https://openalex.org/W3164381172,"Peg3 (Paternally expressed gene 3) is an imprinted gene encoding a DNA-binding protein that is a well-known transcriptional repressor. Previous studies have shown that the mutant phenotypes of Peg3 are associated with the over-expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. In the current study, we investigated four potential downstream genes of Peg3, which were identified through ChIP-seq data: Acly, Fasn, Idh1, and Hmgcr. In vivo binding of PEG3 to the promoter region of these key genes involved in lipogenesis was subsequently confirmed through individual ChIP experiments. We observed the opposite response of Acly expression levels against the variable gene dosages of Peg3, involving 0x, 1x, and 2x Peg3. This suggests the transcriptional repressor role of Peg3 in the expression levels of Acly. Another set of analyses showed a sex-biased response in the expression levels of Acly, Fasn, and Idh1 against 0x Peg3 with higher levels in female and lower levels in male mammary glands. These results overall highlight that Peg3 may be involved in regulating the expression levels of several key genes in adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3164563465,"A unique and highly virulent subgenogroup (-IVb) of Piscine novirhabdovirus , also known as Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV), suddenly appeared in the Laurentian Great Lakes, causing large mortality outbreaks in 2005 and 2006, and affecting &gt;32 freshwater fish species. Periods of apparent dormancy have punctuated smaller and more geographically-restricted outbreaks in 2007, 2008, and 2017. In this study, we conduct the largest whole genome sequencing analysis of VHSV-IVb to date, evaluating its evolutionary changes from 48 isolates in relation to immunogenicity in cell culture. Our investigation compares genomic and genetic variation, selection, and rates of sequence changes in VHSV-IVb, in relation to other VHSV genogroups (VHSV-I, VHSV-II, VHSV-III, and VHSV-IVa) and with other Novirhabdoviruses. Results show that the VHSV-IVb isolates we sequenced contain 253 SNPs (2.3% of the total 11,158 nucleotides) across their entire genomes, with 85 (33.6%) of them being non-synonymous. The most substitutions occurred in the non-coding region (NCDS; 4.3%), followed by the Nv- (3.8%), and M- (2.8%) genes. Proportionally more M -gene substitutions encoded amino acid changes (52.9%), followed by the Nv- (50.0%), G- (48.6%), N- (35.7%) and L- (23.1%) genes. Among VHSV genogroups and subgenogroups, VHSV-IVa from the northeastern Pacific Ocean has shown the fastest substitution rate (2.01x10 -3 ), followed by VHSV-IVb (6.64x10 -5 ) and by the VHSV-I, -II and-III genogroups from Europe (4.09x10 -5 ). A 2016 gizzard shad ( Dorosoma cepedianum ) from Lake Erie possessed the most divergent VHSV-IVb sequence. The in vitro immunogenicity analysis of that sample displayed reduced virulence (as did the other samples from 2016), in comparison to the original VHSV-IVb isolate (which had been traced back to 2003, as an origin date). The 2016 isolates that we tested induced milder impacts on fish host cell innate antiviral responses, suggesting altered phenotypic effects. In conclusion, our overall findings indicate that VHSV-IVb has undergone continued sequence change and a trend to lower virulence over its evolutionary history (2003 through present-day), which may facilitate its long-term persistence in fish host populations."
https://openalex.org/W3164905353,"Circadian clocks orchestrate multiple different physiological rhythms in a well-synchronized manner. However, how these separate rhythms are interconnected is not exactly understood. Here, we developed a method that allows for the real-time simultaneous measurement of locomotor activity and body temperature of mice using infrared video camera imaging. As expected from the literature, temporal profiles of body temperature and locomotor activity were positively correlated with each other. Basically, body temperatures were high when animals were in locomotion. However, interestingly, increases in body temperature were not always associated with the appearance of locomotor activity. Video imaging revealed that mice exhibit non-locomotor activities such as grooming and postural adjustments, which alone induce considerable elevation of body temperature. Noticeably, non-locomotor movements always preceded the initiation of locomotor activity. Nevertheless, non-locomotor movements were not always accompanied by locomotor movements, suggesting that non-locomotor movements provide a mechanism of thermoregulation independent of locomotor activity. In addition, in the current study, we also report the development of a machine learning-based recording method for the detection of circadian feeding and drinking behaviors of mice. Our data illustrate the potential utility of thermal video imaging in the investigation of different physiological rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W3165059209,"Except cells circulating in the bloodstream, most cells in vertebrates are adherent. Studying the repercussions of adherence per se in cell physiology is thus very difficult to carry out, although it plays an important role in cancer biology, e.g. in the metastasis process. In order to study how adherence impacts major cell functions, we used a murine macrophage cell line. Opposite to the monocyte/macrophage system, where adherence is associated with the acquisition of differentiated functions, these cells can be grown in both adherent or suspension conditions without altering their differentiated functions (phagocytosis and inflammation signaling). We used a proteomic approach to cover a large panel of proteins potentially modified by the adherence status. Targeted experiments were carried out to validate the proteomic results, e.g. on metabolic enzymes, mitochondrial and cytoskeletal proteins. The mitochondrial activity was increased in non-adherent cells compared with adherent cells, without differences in glucose consumption. Concerning the cytoskeleton, a rearrangement of the actin organization (filopodia vs sub-cortical network) and of the microtubule network were observed between adherent and non-adherent cells. Taken together, these data show the mechanisms at play for the modification of the cytoskeleton and also modifications of the metabolic activity between adherent and non-adherent cells."

This retrospective cohort study with 83 cerebrospinal fluid culture-confirmed CM patients was conducted at China Medical University Hospital from 2003 to 2016. The 3-year mortality rate in patients with CM was 54% (45 deaths among 83 patients). Advanced age, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seronegative state, low Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission, decreased hemoglobin and hyperglycemia on diagnosis were associated with 3-year mortality. After multivariate adjustment in the Cox proportional hazard model, only severe hyperglycemia (serum glucose ≥200 mg/dL) on diagnosis could predict 3-year mortality."

However, limited is known about interactive effect of nitrogen (N) and boron (B) nutrition on pomological, yield and fruit quality attributes of grafted watermelon. This two-year study tested the influence of different N and B doses on pomological, yield and fruit quality attributes of grafted watermelon under field conditions in Çukurova plains of Turkey. Four different N (0, 90, 180 and 270 kg ha-1) and two B doses (0 and 2 kg ha-1 B) were tested. The individual and interactive effects of N and B significantly altered pomological, yield and fruit quality attributes during both years. Overall, application of 270 kg ha-1 N and 2 kg ha-1 B improved yield, pomological and fruit quality attributes during both years. The highest values for yield, main stem length, stem diameter, fruit weight, fruit width, number nodes and branches per stem were recorded for 270 kg ha-1 N during both years. However, rind thickness was not altered by N application. Similarly, the highest values for quality attributes such as sucrose, glucose, fructose, citric acid, tartaric acid and ascorbic acid were noted for 270 kg ha-1 N during both years. Interestingly, no N application and 90 kg ha-1 N recorded the highest values of maleic acid during both years. The highest values of rind thickness, fruit length, fruit width and fruit weight were noted for 2 kg ha-1 B during both years, while B application had no effect on main stem length, main stem diameter, number of nodes and number of branches. Regarding N by B interactions, 180 and 270 kg ha-1 N with both B doses observed the highest values for yield, pomological and quality attributes during each year. These results indicate that N has significant contribution towards yield, pomological attributes and fruit quality of grafted watermelon. Therefore, N should be applied at the rate of 270 kg ha-1 for better yield, pomological attributes and fruit quality. Nonetheless, where necessary grafted watermelon should be fertilized with 2 kg ha-1 B for better fruit quality and pomological attributes."
https://openalex.org/W3163967185,"While albino mice are widely used in research which includes the use of visually guided behavioral tests, information on their visual capability is scarce. We compared the spatial resolution (acuity) of albino mice (BALB/c) with that of pigmented mice (C57BL/6J). We used a high-throughput pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and pattern visual evoked potential (PVEP) method for objective assessment of retinal and cortical acuity, as well as optomotor head-tracking response/ reflex (OMR). We found that PERG, PVEP, and OMR acuities of C57BL/6J mice were all in the range of 0.5–0.6 cycles/degree (cyc/deg). BALB/c mice had PERG and PVEP acuities in the range of 0.1–0.2 cyc/deg but were unresponsive to OMR stimulus. Results indicate that retinal and cortical acuity can be reliably determined with electrophysiological methods in BALB/c mice, although PERG/PVEP acuities are lower than those of C57BL/6J mice. The reduced acuity of BALB/c mice appears to be primarily determined at retinal level."
https://openalex.org/W3164022449,"In this paper, we try to analyse the extent to which a redefinition of the monetary policy rule would help to avoid the zero-lower bound, as well as to explore the conditions needed to avoid that constraint. To that aim, we estimate the threshold values of the key variables of the policy rule: the inflation gap and the output gap. The threshold model allows us to know which are the turning points from which the relationship between the key variables and the interest rate revert. In the Eurozone countries, we have found that the inflation gap always contributes to increasing the nominal interest rate. On the contrary, the output gap works differently when it reaches values above or below the threshold value, which would favour the reduction of the interest rates towards the zero level."

HRQoL data collected after one year from newly diagnosed 436 TB patients who were registered and successfully completed treatment at Government health facilities in Tiruvallur district, south India under the National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) were used for this analysis. In this study, the four independent latent variables such as physical well-being (PW = PW1-7), mental well-being (MW = MW1-7), social well-being (SW = SW1-4) and habits were considered. The BSEM was constructed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for identifying the factors that contribute to the HRQoL of TB patients who completed treatment.Bayesian estimates were obtained using 46,300 observations after convergence and the standardized structural regression estimate of PW, MW, SW on HRQoL were 0.377 (p<0.001), 0.543 (p<0.001) and 0.208 (p<0.001) respectively. The latent variables PW, MW and SW were significantly associated with HRQoL of TB patients. The age was found to be significantly negatively associated with HRQoL of TB patients.The current study demonstrated the application of BSEM in evaluating HRQoL.

In the present study, two experiments were conducted to explore the effects of different emotion-inducing methods on memory between healthy participants and non-clinically depressed participants. The results from experiment 1 showed that when feedback was used as induction, the memory performance of the non-clinical depression group was significantly higher than that of the healthy group under the condition of negative feedback. Under positive and neutral feedback, there were no significant differences between the two groups. In experiment 2, when emotional materials were used as a mode of induction, no significantly difference in each emotional condition between the healthy and depressed groups was found. The results of the present study show that different methods of emotional induction have different effects on depressed participants. Compared with the emotion induced by the emotional material, the non-clinical depressed participants had a better memory effect induced by negative emotional events."

For the purpose of expanding the usefulness of correlational techniques, this article focuses on the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and the Fisher's z transformation for developing equivalence procedures of correlation coefficients. Equivalence tests are proposed to assess whether a correlation coefficient is within a designated reference range for declaring equivalence decisions. The important aspects of Type I error rate, power calculation, and sample size determination are also considered. Special emphasis is given to clarify the nature and deficiency of the two one-sided tests for detecting a lack of association. The findings demonstrate the inappropriateness of existing methods for equivalence appraisal and validate the suggested techniques as reliable and primary tools in correlation analysis."

In March 2020, stringent national restrictions were enforced in the UK to protect public health and slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Restrictions were likely to have resulted in collateral consequences for the health and welfare of horses and ponies, especially those at risk of obesity and laminitis and this issue warranted more detailed exploration. The current study utilised qualitative methodology to investigate the implications of COVID-19 related policies upon equine management and welfare with a focus on horses and ponies at risk of laminitis and obesity. Twenty-four interviews with five sub-groups of key equestrian welfare stakeholders in the UK were conducted between May and July of 2020 to understand the challenges facing equine welfare in the context of laminitis and obesity susceptible animals. Thematic analysis revealed lockdown-associated factors with the potential to compromise welfare of horses and ponies at risk of obesity and laminitis. These included: disparate information and guidance, difficulties enacting public health measures in yard environments, and horses having reduced exercise during the pandemic. Positive examples of clear and consistent information sharing by farriers were reported to have improved horse owner understanding of routine hoof care during lockdown. Analysis suggested that the recommendations for supporting the management-based needs of horses under reduced supervision were not clearly defined, or were not sufficiently disseminated, across the equine industry. These findings support the development of guidelines specific to the care of horses and ponies at risk of obesity and laminitis through collaborative input from veterinary and welfare experts, to reduce the negative impacts of future lockdown events in the UK."
https://openalex.org/W3164982148,"Altered attentional processing of pain-associated stimuli-which might take the form of either avoidance or enhanced vigilance-is thought to be implicated in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. In contrast to reaction time tasks like the dot probe, eye tracking allows for tracking the time course of visual attention and thus differentiating early and late attentional processes. Our study aimed at investigating visual attention to emotional faces in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (N = 20) and matched pain-free controls (N = 20). Emotional faces (pain, angry, happy) were presented in pairs with a neutral face for 2000 ms each. Three parameters were determined: First fixation probabilities, fixation durations (overall and divided in four 500 ms intervals) and a fixation bias score as the relative fixation duration of emotional faces compared to neutral faces. There were no group differences in any of the parameters. First fixation probabilities were lower for pain faces than for angry faces. Overall, we found longer fixation duration on emotional compared to neutral faces ('emotionality bias'), which is in accord with previous research. However, significant longer fixation duration compared to the neutral face was detected only for happy and angry but not for pain faces. In addition, fixation durations as well as bias scores yielded evidence for vigilant-avoidant processing of pain faces in both groups. These results suggest that attentional bias towards pain-associated stimuli might not generally differentiate between healthy individuals and chronic pain patients. Exaggerated attentional bias in patients might occur only under specific circumstances, e.g., towards stimulus material specifically relating to the specific pain of the patients under study or under high emotional distress."

Methods In each season between 2006/07 and 2015/16, we fitted multilevel Poisson regression models to compare GP consultation rates for clinically diagnosed influenza, acute respiratory infections (ARI), pneumonia, and lower back pain (as a control) between vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals. Season-specific relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled into summary risk ratio (SRR) through random-effects meta-analysis models. Analyses were stratified by patient age (&lt;45, 45–59, 60–74, ≥75 years) and medical indication for the vaccine (any vs. none, subjects aged ≤60 years only). Results Overall, 12.6% and 21.4% of study subjects were vaccinated because of their age only or because of an underlying medical condition. Vaccine uptake declined over time, especially among subjects aged ≤74 years with medical indications for vaccination. Vaccinated individuals had significantly higher GP consultation rates for clinically diagnosed influenza (SRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.12–1.38, p-value &lt;0.001), ARI (SRR 1.33, 95% CI 1.27–1.39, p-value &lt;0.001), pneumonia (SRR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19–1.36, p-value &lt;0.001), and lower back pain (SRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.14–1.28, p-value &lt;0.001) compared to unvaccinated individuals. Discussion Contrary to expectations, influenza vaccinees have GP consultation rates for clinically diagnosed influenza, ARI and pneumonia that are 24–33% higher compared to unvaccinated individuals. The lower back pain finding suggests that the increase in consultation rates is partially caused by confounding. Importantly, considering the data are not laboratory-confirmed, our results cannot be linked directly to influenza, but only to respiratory illnesses in general."
https://openalex.org/W3165806931,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are major contributors to morbidity and mortality in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Features of the natural environment, such as greenness, are a potential, modifiable determinant of CVD, yet there is a lack of evidence, particularly in LMICs. Our study investigated associations between residential greenness, measured using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and self-reported heart disease in 5268 Sri Lankan men aged 34 to 55 years. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to examine associations between mean NDVI within 100 m, 400 m, 800 m, 1600 m, and 2000 m of the residential address, adjusting for age, marital status, income, education, alcohol consumption, smoking and road length. Fully adjusted models showed that a 0.1 increase in mean NDVI was associated with lower odds of heart disease when using the 400 m (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.00), 800 m (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.14), and 2000 m (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.13) buffers. Further research in different contexts, and with improved outcome measures, is needed to confirm relationships between residential greenness and heart disease in rural areas and in LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W3164157833,"Public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the veterinary domain are widely implemented worldwide and can help to strengthen the capacities of Veterinary Services. Few analyses have been made of these initiatives. This study is aimed at developing an evaluation tool based on participatory approaches and focusing on the quality of PPP processes in the veterinary domain. The tool was divided into ten sections relevant to PPP process organisation and activities. The 44 evaluation criteria and six quality attributes (operationality, relevance, acceptability, inclusiveness, adaptability, and stability) were identified based on literature review and case-study application. The tool was adjusted during four regional PPP training workshops bringing together stakeholders from both public and private sectors. Finally, the tool was validated through an experts' elicitation process and applied in the field in Paraguay. The tool was developed in a non-normative perspective to help the partners adapt the PPP to their specific context, to maximize the opportunities and minimize the risks of such collaborations, and to formulate adapted recommendations to strengthen and improve the PPP collaborative process and thus the outcomes. In an ex-ante perspective, this tool would also help public and private actors to engage and develop a PPP process following the best possible practices. The aim of this tool is to help decision making in terms of PPP development and implementation in the veterinary domain to ensure the added value and relevance of such a collaborative approach in different countries worldwide."
