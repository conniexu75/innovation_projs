https://openalex.org/W2980128108,"In cancer, recurrent somatic single-nucleotide variants—which are rare in most paediatric cancers—are confined largely to protein-coding genes1–3. Here we report highly recurrent hotspot mutations (r.3A>G) of U1 spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in about 50% of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastomas. These mutations were not present across other subgroups of medulloblastoma, and we identified these hotspot mutations in U1 snRNA in only <0.1% of 2,442 cancers, across 36 other tumour types. The mutations occur in 97% of adults (subtype SHHδ) and 25% of adolescents (subtype SHHα) with SHH medulloblastoma, but are largely absent from SHH medulloblastoma in infants. The U1 snRNA mutations occur in the 5′ splice-site binding region, and snRNA-mutant tumours have significantly disrupted RNA splicing and an excess of 5′ cryptic splicing events. Alternative splicing mediated by mutant U1 snRNA inactivates tumour-suppressor genes (PTCH1) and activates oncogenes (GLI2 and CCND2), and represents a target for therapy. These U1 snRNA mutations provide an example of highly recurrent and tissue-specific mutations of a non-protein-coding gene in cancer. Highly recurrent hotspot r.3A>G mutations are identified in U1 splicesomal small nuclear RNAs in about 50% of Sonic hedgehog medulloblastomas, which result in disrupted RNA splicing and the activation of oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2982660864,"Objective To identify modifiable risk factors for development and progression of frailty in older adults living in England, as conceptualised by a multidimensional frailty index (FI). Methods Data from participants aged 50 and over from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) was used to examine potential determinants of frailty, using a 56-item FI comprised of self-reported health conditions, disabilities, cognitive function, hearing, eyesight, depressive symptoms and ability to carry out activities of daily living. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to measure frailty development (n = 7420) and linear regression models to measure frailty progression over 12 years follow-up (n = 8780). Results Increasing age (HR: 1.08 (CI: 1.08–1.09)), being in the lowest wealth quintile (HR: 1.79 (CI: 1.54–2.08)), lack of educational qualifications (HR: 1.19 (CI: 1.09–1.30)), obesity (HR: 1.33 (CI: 1.18–1.50) and a high waist-hip ratio (HR: 1.25 (CI: 1.13–1.38)), being a current or previous smoker (HR: 1.29 (CI: 1.18–1.41)), pain (HR: 1.39 (CI: 1.34–1.45)), sedentary behaviour (HR: 2.17 (CI: 1.76–2.78) and lower body strength (HR: 1.07 (CI: 1.06–1.08)), were all significant risk factors for frailty progression and incidence after simultaneous adjustment for all examined factors. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that there may be scope to reduce both frailty incidence and progression by trialling interventions aimed at reducing obesity and sedentary behaviour, increasing intensity of physical activity, and improving success of smoking cessation tools. Furthermore, improving educational outcomes and reducing poverty may also reduce inequalities in frailty."
https://openalex.org/W2982637165,"The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling axis is a target of covalent drugs and bioactive native electrophiles. However, much of our understanding of Nrf2 regulation has been focused at the protein level. Here we report a post-transcriptional modality to directly regulate Nrf2-mRNA. Our initial studies focused on the effects of the key mRNA-binding protein (mRBP) HuR on global transcriptomic changes incurred upon oxidant or electrophile stimulation. These RNA-sequencing data and subsequent mechanistic analyses led us to discover a novel role of HuR in regulating Nrf2 activity, and in the process, we further identified the related mRBP AUF1 as an additional novel Nrf2 regulator. Both mRBPs regulate Nrf2 activity by direct interaction with the Nrf2 transcript. Our data showed that HuR enhances Nrf2-mRNA maturation and promotes its nuclear export, whereas AUF1 stabilizes Nrf2-mRNA. Both mRBPs target the 3'-UTR of Nrf2-mRNA. Using a Nrf2 activity-reporter zebrafish strain, we document that this post-transcriptional control of Nrf2 activity is conserved at the whole-vertebrate level.-Poganik, J. R., Long, M. J.

https://openalex.org/W2982541072,"Background Physical activity (PA) as a precondition of child development is related with social environmental correlates. However, domain-specific PA and gender issues have been neglected in studies on social support and modelling and PA in school-aged children. The aim of this study was to assess the relationships of parental and peer modelling and social support with domain-specific PA participation in a large sample of school-aged children, taking gender into account. Methods 3,505 school children aged 6 to 17 years old participated in the German nationwide ‘MoMo’ cohort-study. By using the MoMo-PAQ the participants and their parents provided self-report data on perceived social support and social modelling and domain-specific PA participation. Relationships of social environmental variables and the physical outcomes were analysed by logistic regression analyses. Results At secondary school level, girls were less likely than boys to participate in physical activity in and outside of sports clubs, extra-curricular physical activity and in outdoor play (p < 0.05), but at primary school level this pattern only applied to club sport (p < 0.01). Girls also received less social support than boys (p < 0.01). Physical activity participation in all domains was associated with any of the social support and modelling variables and differences between physical activity domains and between boys and girls occurred. Most consistently physical activity in sports clubs was related with the social environmental correlates in boys (primary school: R2 = 0.60; secondary school: R2 = 0.45) and girls (primary school: R2 = 0.53; secondary school: R2 = 0.47). Conclusions In future, reciprocal relationships of social environmental variables and PA should be considered in longitudinal studies to obtain insights into the direction of the associations. Furthermore, interventions encompassing the social environment and focussed particularly on the promotion of domain-specific PA in girls in secondary school-age are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2982631587,"Statements about building walls, deportation and denying services to undocumented immigrants made during President Trump's presidential campaign and presidency may induce fear in Latino populations and create barriers to their health care access. To assess how these statements relate to undocumented Latino immigrants' (UDLI) and Latino legal residents/citizens' (LLRC) perceptions of safety and their presentations for emergency care, we conducted surveys of adult patients at three county emergency departments (EDs) in California from June 2017 to December 2018. Of 1,684 patients approached, 1,337 (79.4%) agreed to participate: 34.3% UDLI, 36.9% LLRC, and 29.8% non-Latino legal residents/citizens (NLRC). The vast majority of UDLI (95%), LLRC (94%) and NLRC (85%) had heard statements about immigrants. Most UDLI (89%), LLRC (88%) and NLRC (87%) either thought that these measures were being enacted now or will be enacted in the future. Most UDLI and half of LLRC reported that these statements made them feel unsafe living in the US, 75% (95% CI 70-80%) and 51% (95% CI 47-56%), respectively. More UDLI reported that these statements made them afraid to come to the ED (24%, 95% CI 20-28%) vs LLRC (4.4%, 95% CI 3-7%) and NLRC (3.5%, 95% CI 2-6%); 55% of UDLI with this fear stated it caused them to delay coming to the ED (median delay 2-3 days). The vast majority of patients in our California EDs have heard statements during the 2016 presidential campaign or from President Trump about measures against undocumented immigrants, which have induced worry and safety concerns in both UDLI and LLRC patients. Exposure to these statements was also associated with fear of accessing emergency care in some UDLIs. Given California's sanctuary state status, these safety concerns and ED access fears may be greater in a nationwide population of Latinos."

https://openalex.org/W2982319582,"Most cell wall and secreted β-glucans are synthesised by the CAZy Glycosyltransferase 2 family (www.cazy.org), with different members catalysing the formation of (1,4)-β-, (1,3)-β-, or both (1,4)- and (1,3)-β-glucosidic linkages. Given the distinct physicochemical properties of each of the resultant β-glucans (cellulose, curdlan, and mixed linkage glucan, respectively) are crucial to their biological and biotechnological functions, there is a desire to understand the molecular evolution of synthesis and how linkage specificity is determined. With structural studies hamstrung by the instability of these proteins to solubilisation, we have utilised in silico techniques and the crystal structure for a bacterial cellulose synthase to further understand how these enzymes have evolved distinct functions. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses were performed to determine amino acid conservation, both family-wide and within each sub-family. Further structural analysis centred on comparison of a bacterial curdlan synthase homology model with the bacterial cellulose synthase crystal structure, with molecular dynamics simulations performed with their respective β-glucan products bound in the trans-membrane channel. Key residues that differentially interact with the different β-glucan chains and have sub-family-specific conservation were found to reside at the entrance of the trans-membrane channel. The linkage-specific catalytic activity of these enzymes and hence the type of β-glucan chain built is thus likely determined by the different interactions between the proteins and the first few glucose residues in the channel, which in turn dictates the position of the acceptor glucose. The sequence-function relationships for the bacterial β-glucan synthases pave the way for extending this understanding to other kingdoms, such as plants."
https://openalex.org/W2982526456,"Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), the major member of advanced glycation end products, was widely studied in diabetic complications and aging-associated diseases. However, the impact of CML on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI) was rarely reported. In the present study, CML was increased in both patients with acute myocardial infarction (53.4 ± 7.8 vs. 28.1 ± 4.4 ng; P = 0.017), and mice underwent MI/RI (16.4 ± 1.4 vs. 10.8 ± 0.9 ng; P = 0.006). Depletion of neutrophils reduced CML (17.8 ± 1.0 vs. 9.9 ± 0.3 ng; P < 0.001), indicating neutrophils were the major cells contributing to CML formation during MI/RI. CML treatment exacerbated MI/RI by elevating myocardial injury marker (274.3 ± 18.0 vs. 477.2 ± 34.3 pg; P < 0.001), enlarging myocardial infarct size (32.9 ± 3.6 vs. 45.2 ± 3.8%; P = 0.03), increasing myocardial fibrosis (17.5 ± 1.6 vs. 29.7 ± 2.2%; P < 0.001) and impairing cardiac function (59.4 ± 2.4% vs. 46.0 ± 1.3%; P = 0.001). Further study revealed that CML increased the phosphorylation of receptor interacting protein (RIP) 3, an important initiator of necroptosis, and its downstream proteins. Receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) deficiency effectively blocked RIP3 phosphorylation induced by CML and rescued CML-mediated MI/RI, indicating CML promoted RIP3-mediated necroptosis through RAGE. In addition, glyoxalase-1 overexpression could effectively attenuate MI/RI by reducing CML formation, providing a potential therapeutic target for MI/RI.-Yang, J., Zhang, F., Shi, H., Gao, Y., Dong, Z., Ma, L., Sun, X., Li, X., Chang, S., Wang, Z., Qu, Y., Li, H., Hu, K., Sun, A., Ge, J.

https://openalex.org/W2982350926,"Negative social interactions have been extensively studied in dairy cattle, but little is known about the establishment of positive (preferential) relationships. Adult dairy cows are known to spend more time at close proximity to specific social partners, indicating that they establish stronger bonds with these animals, but few studies have explored what happens in socially housed calves. In this study, we explored whether calves that spent their entire life in the same social group established social preferences (i.e. pairs of individuals that interact more) that are stable over time (two 48-h periods, separated by three days), across two types of behavior (standing and lying) and across contexts (change in environment and housing design). When housed in an open pack, calves showed consistent proximity patterns when standing (but not when lying). These preferential relationships persisted even after calves were moved into a new pen fitted with free stalls. At the individual level, calves varied in how selective they were in their social relationships, with some calves spending much more time with specific partners than did others. This degree of selectivity was not associated to Sociability, marginally associated to Fearfulness, but was associated with Pessimism (more pessimistic calves were more selective in their social relationships). In conclusion, calves can form selective relationships that appeared to be consistent over time and across context, and the degree to which calves were selective varied in relation to individual differences in Pessimism."
https://openalex.org/W2982418603,"Several studies reported an association between Caesarean section (CS) birth and childhood obesity. However, there are several limitations in the current literature. These include an inability to distinguish between planned and emergency CS, small study sample sizes and not adjusting for pre-pregnancy body-mass-index (BMI). We examined the association between CS delivery and childhood obesity using the United Kingdom Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).Mother-infant pairs were recruited into the MCS. Use of sampling weights ensured the sample was representative of the population. The exposure was categorised as normal vaginal delivery (VD) [reference], assisted VD, planned CS and emergency CS. Childhood obesity prevalence, at age three, five, seven, eleven and fourteen years was calculated using the International Obesity Taskforce criteria. Mixed-effects linear regression models were fitted with associations adjusted for several potential confounders like maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, education and infant macrosomia. Linear regression models were fitted evaluating body fat percentage (BF%), at age seven and fourteen years.Of the 18,116 infants, 3872 (21.4%) were delivered by CS; 9.2% by planned CS. Obesity prevalence was 5.4%, 5.7%, 6.5%, 7.1% and 7.6% at age three, five, seven, eleven and fourteen years respectively. The mixed-effects linear regression model showed no association between planned (adjusted mean difference = 0.00; [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10; 0.10], p-value = 0.97) or emergency CS (adjusted mean difference = 0.08; [95% CI -0.01; 0.17], p-value = 0.09) and child BMI. At age seven years, there was no association between planned CS and BF% (adjusted mean difference = 0.13; [95% CI -0.23; 0.49]); there was no association at age fourteen years.Infants born by planned CS did not have a significantly higher BMI or BF% compared to those born by normal VD. This may suggest that the association, described in the literature, could be due to the indications/reasons for CS birth or residual confounding."
https://openalex.org/W2982531774,"Background Client satisfaction towards the pharmacist services is essential to measure the level of pharmacy services offered to clients and the implementation of pharmaceutical care in the hospital. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess client satisfaction towards the pharmacist service from April 20 to 30, 2019 at OPD pharmacy of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH). Clients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were interviewed by using a five scale Likert scale. Then data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21. The results of the study were presented using table, frequency, and percentage. A binary logistic regression was also employed. The association was declared at p<0.05. Result In this study 250 study participants were included. Majority of the participants were males (56.4%, n = 141) with the mean (±standard deviation) age of 38.97±13.73. The mean satisfaction was 51.6%. Study participants perception on pharmacy staff number insufficiency (AOR = 0.32, 95%CI: 0.17, 0.59) and their perception towards the waiting area scored as somewhat fair (AOR = 0.50 (0.27, 0.94) and not convenient (AOR = 0.18 (0.06, 0.56) were negatively associated with their satisfaction. Conclusion In this study, study participants have an overall satisfaction of above 50%. Respondent satisfaction for pharmacist approach or communication skill was higher than their satisfaction towards the medication guidance given to them. Study participants perception of the waiting area and staff number sufficiency for the service were significant predictors of their satisfaction. Hence, the TASH administration is expected to improve such pharmaceutical service areas to meet patient demands."
https://openalex.org/W2982560632,"The information processing capability of the brain decreases during unconscious states. Capturing this decrease during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness has been attempted using standard spectral analyses as these correlate relatively well with breakdowns in corticothalamic networks. Much of this work has involved the use of propofol to perturb brain activity, as it is one of the most widely used anesthetics for routine surgical anesthesia. Propofol administration alone produces EEG spectral characteristics similar to most hypnotics; however, inter-individual and drug variation render spectral measures inconsistent. Complexity measures of EEG signals could offer better measures to distinguish brain states, because brain activity exhibits nonlinear behavior at several scales during transitions of consciousness. We tested the potential of complexity analyses from nonlinear dynamics to identify loss and recovery of consciousness at clinically relevant timepoints. Patients undergoing propofol general anesthesia for various surgical procedures were identified as having changes in states of consciousness by the loss and recovery of response to verbal stimuli after induction and upon cessation of anesthesia, respectively. We demonstrate that nonlinear dynamics analyses showed more significant differences between consciousness states than spectral measures. Notably, attractors in conscious and anesthesia-induced unconscious states exhibited significantly different shapes. These shapes have implications for network connectivity, information processing, and the total number of states available to the brain at these different levels. They also reflect some of our general understanding of the network effects of consciousness in a way that spectral measures cannot. Thus, complexity measures could provide a universal means for reliably capturing depth of consciousness based on EEG changes at the beginning and end of anesthesia administration."
https://openalex.org/W2982296770,"Although tobacco smoke has been associated with many infections, little is known of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV) infections among young adult women. The aim of the study was to explore the association of tobacco smoke exposure on HPV infections in young adult women in the United States. It was hypothesized that tobacco smoke exposure (both active and passive) as objectively measured by cotinine levels was associated with increased HPV infection in a national sample of 18 and 26 year-old women in the United States.The NHANES 2007-2012 dataset was used in the analyses. A national representative sample of women 18 to 26 year old (N = 1,414) was included in the study. Infection with any HPV was determined by PCR while tobacco smoke exposure was determined by measuring serum cotinine levels. Women with cotinine levels <0.05 ng/mL were considered unexposed and those with levels > = 0.05 were considered as exposed. Exposed women were further categorized as passive smokers (cotinine levels 0.05-<10 ng/mL, while active smokers were those with cotinine levels = > 10ng/mL). Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis. Exposed women (passive smokers with cotinine levels > = 0.05ng/mL-10ng/mL) were almost 2 times (64% vs 35%) more likely to be infected with any HPV type than their unexposed counterparts (cotinine levels <0.05ng/mL). Also women who were active smokers (cotinine levels > = 10 ng/mL) were more than twice more likely (75%) to be infected with the virus than the unexposed counterparts. The relationship held true even after controlling for various socio-demographics. Indeed in the multiple regression analyses controlling for the various confounders, compared to their unexposed counterparts, women exposed to second hand smoke were more than twice more likely to have HPV infections (OR: 2.45; 95% C.I = 1.34-4.48). When compared to their unexposed counterparts, actively smoking women were more than 3.5 times more likely to be infected with HPV (OR = 3.56; 95% CI 1.23-10.30). Finally, a strong dose-response relationship was further demonstrated with increasing risk of HPV with each quartile of cotinine levels even after controlling for various confounders. The risk of HPV was lowest in the lowest quartile (Referent OR = 1) and increased steadily with each quartile of cotinine levels until the risk was highest among women with cotinine levels in the 4th quartile (OR = 4.16; 95% C.I. = 1.36-12.67).Both passive and active tobacco smoking were strongly associated with any HPV infection in 18 to 26 year old young women with a significant dose-response relationship. Future studies should explore the effect of tobacco smoke exposure among younger women less than 18 years of age."
https://openalex.org/W2982449925,"Most research manuscripts are not accepted for publication on first submission. A major part of the resubmission process is reformatting to another journal's specific requirements, a process separate from revising the scientific content. There has been little research to understand the magnitude of the burden imposed by the current resubmission process.We analyzed original research article submission requirements from twelve randomly selected journals in each of eight scientific and clinical focus areas from the InCites Journal Citation Reports database. From the 96 journals selected, we randomly identified three recently published manuscripts and sent surveys to those first and/or corresponding authors (288 total) to solicit information on time spent reformatting resubmissions and opinions on the process.There was significant variation in manuscript submission requirements for journals within the same scientific focus and only 4% of journals offered a fully format-free initial submission. Of 203 authors responding (71.5% response rate), only 11.8% expressed satisfaction with the resubmission process and 91% desired reforming the current system. Time spent on reformatting delays most publications by at least two weeks and by over three months in about 20% of manuscripts. The effort to comply with submission requirements has significant global economic burden, estimated at over $1.1 billion dollars annually when accounting for a research team's time.We demonstrate that there is significant resource utilization associated with resubmitting manuscripts, heretofore not properly quantified. The vast majority of authors are not satisfied with the current process. Addressing these issues by reconciling reformatting requirements among journals or adopting a universal format-free initial submission policy would help resolve a major subject for the scientific research community and provide more efficient dissemination of findings."
https://openalex.org/W2982439028,"Background Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a man-made problem when bacteria are resistant to at least two anti TB drugs (Rifampicin and Isoniazid). Currently from tuberculosis infected patients, two out of ten are developing MDR-TB and it is an emerging public health problem in Ethiopia. Despite high burden of MDR-TB in Ethiopia, the treatment outcomes and predictors related to incidence among MDR-TB patients is not studied in Oromia region, Ethiopia. Therefore, the present study assessed the predictors of time to unfavorable treatment outcomes among patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Oromia region, Ethiopia Method Facility based retrospective cohort study was conducted at hospitals in Oromia Region. All registered MDR-TB patient charts from 2015 to 2017 were considered for the study. Data entry was done by using EPI data version 3.1 Statistical Software and data analysis was done by SPSS version 20. The descriptive statistics, frequency, median and range were employed. Bivariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to identify predictors of time to unfavorable treatment outcomes of multidrug resistant tuberculosis. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the variables with P- value less than and equal to 0.05 were considered as predictor variables for time to unfavorable treatment outcome of MDR-TB. Result From the total of 415 (92.84%) complete MDR-TB charts, the overall cumulative probability of unfavorable treatment outcome at the end of the treatment (two years) was 21.21%. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis initial culture result [AHR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.96], HIV test result [AHR = 3.76; 95% CI: 2.45, 5.78] and culture at the end of continuation phases [AHR = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.20] were the predictors of unfavorable treatment outcome. Conclusion The magnitude of unfavorable treatment outcome at Oromia hospitals was lower than WHO regional report of 2018. This finding demonstrated that low unfavorable treatment outcomes for MDR-TB patients can be achieved in a resource-constrained and high TB-burden setting. Whereas, Initial culture result, HIV test result and culture at the end of continuation phases were determined as predictor factors with associated unfavorable treatment outcomes. Culture positive and HIV positive MDR-TB patients need special attention at the time of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2982447307,"Food labels may have both informational and signaling influences on consumer demand. We conduct a choice experiment with over 1,300 subjects to examine the signaling effect of the food product labels on consumer demand for other competing products in the market. Specifically, we focus on the genetically modified (GM) text labeling for fresh produce (strawberries, apples, and potatoes) in the United States. Contrary to some previous studies, our results indicate that the absence-claim label (Not-GM) does not have a negative impact on the demand for related conventional products. Instead, we find that consumer demand for unlabeled products is significantly enhanced with the introduction of presence-claimed GM labels. Our results contribute to the ongoing discussion of the enactment of mandatory labeling for GM foods by the federal U.S. government. Our results suggest that, in the case of direct text disclosure labels, consumers may no longer differentiate between unlabeled products and Not-GM-labeled products after the mandatory GM labeling law is in effect."
https://openalex.org/W2982631667,"Drug resistance is the leading cause of breast cancer-related mortality in women, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype, affecting African American women more aggressively compared to Caucasians women. Of all cancer-related deaths, 15 to 20% are associated with inflammation, where proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the tumorigenesis process. The current study investigated the effects of the polyphenolic compound butein (2',3,4,4'-tetrahydroxychalcone) on cell proliferation and survival, as well as its modulatory effect on the release of proinflammatory cytokines in MDA-MB-231 (Caucasian) and MDA-MB-468 (African American) TNBC cell. The results obtained showed that butein decreased cell viability in a time and dose-dependent manner, and after 72-h of treatment, the cell proliferation rate was reduced in both cell lines. In addition, butein was found to have higher potency in MDA-MB-468, exhibiting anti-proliferative effects in lower concentrations. Apoptosis assays demonstrated that butein (50 μM) increased apoptotic cells in MDA MB-468, showing 60% of the analyzed cells in the apoptotic phase, compared to 20% in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, butein downregulated both protein and mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokine, CCL2, and IKBKE in TNFα-activated Caucasian cells, but not in African Americans. This study demonstrates butein potential in cancer cell suppression showing a higher cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects in African Americans, compared to Caucasians TNBC cells. It also reveals the butein inhibitory effect on CCL2 expression with a possible association with IKBKE downregulation in MDA-MB-231 cells only, indicating that Caucasians and African Americans TNBC cells respond differently to butein treatment. The obtained findings may provide an explanation regarding the poor therapeutic response in African American patients with advanced TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2982527975,"While there are now numerous records of dinosaurs from Cretaceous rocks around the state of Alaska, very few fossil records of terrestrial vertebrates are known from the Mesozoic rocks of the southwestern part of the state. Here we report the new discovery of extensive occurrences of dinosaur tracks from Aniakchak National Monument of the Alaska Peninsula. These tracks are in the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Chignik Formation, a cyclic sequence of rocks, approximately 500–600 m thick, representing shallow marine to nearshore marine environments in the lower part and continental alluvial coastal plain environments in the upper part of the section. These rocks are part of the Peninsular Terrane and paleomagnetic reconstructions based on the volcanic rocks of this terrane suggest that the Chignik Formation was deposited at approximately its current latitude which is almost 57° N. Recent field work in Aniakchak National Monument has revealed over 75 new track sites, dramatically increasing the dinosaur record from the Alaska Peninsula. Most of the combined record of tracks can be attributed to hadrosaurs, the plant-eating duck-billed dinosaurs. Tracks range in size from those made by full-grown adults to juveniles. Other tracks can be attributed to armored dinosaurs, meat-eating dinosaurs, and two kinds of fossil birds. The track size of the predatory dinosaur suggests a body approximately 6–7 m long, about the estimated size of the North Slope tyrannosaurid Nanuqsaurus. The larger bird tracks resemble Magnoavipes denaliensis previously described from Denali National Park, while the smaller bird tracks were made by a bird about the size of a modern Willet. Previous interdisciplinary sedimentologic and paleontologic work in the correlative and well-known dinosaur bonebeds of the Prince Creek Formation 1400km-1500km further north in Alaska suggested that high-latitude hadrosaurs preferred distal coastal plain or lower delta plain habitats. The ichnological record being uncovered in the Chignik Formation of southwestern Alaska is showing that the hadrosaur tracks here were also made in distal coastal and delta plain conditions. This similarity may corroborate the habitat preference model for Cretaceous high-latitude dinosaurs proposed for the data gathered from the Prince Creek Formation, and may indicate that at least Beringian hadrosaurids had similar habitat preferences regardless of latitude."

One thousand six hundred participants were recruited with equal segregation of age (20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s) and gender. We assessed the association between ethical view and gender, age, infertility, and the knowledge level of UTx, using a questionnaire. The findings were as follows. First, 36.5% and 31.0% of respondents agreed that UTx and gestational surrogacy should be approved, respectively. Second, the respondents would potentially choose to receive UTx (34.4%), gestational surrogacy (31.9%), and adoption (40.3%), if they or their partners experienced absolute uterine factor infertility. Third, 10.1%, 5.8%, and 14.3% of the respondents chose UTx, gestational surrogacy, and adoption as the most favorable option, respectively. Fourth, if their daughters suffered from absolute uterine factor infertility, 32.3% of female respondents might want to be donors, and 36.7% of male respondents might ask their wives to be donors. These data were affected by age, gender, infertility, or the knowledge level of UTx. UTx was a more acceptable option than gestational surrogacy and adoption. The effects of gender, age, infertility, and the level of knowledge of UTx are important in understanding the attitude toward UTx.

It is important to continue to understand public attitudes to inform the development and safety of UTx, which will enhance the discussion on the ethical consensus on UTx."
https://openalex.org/W2982303867,"Tapinocephalids were one of the earliest therapsid clades to evolve herbivory. In acquiring derived tooth-to-tooth occlusion by means of an exaggerated heel and talon crown morphology, members of this family have long been considered herbivorous, yet little work has been done to describe their dentition. Given the early occurrence of this clade and their acquisition of a dentition with several derived features, tapinocephalids serve as an important clade in understanding adaptations to herbivory as well as macroevolutionary patterns of dental trait acquisition. Here we describe the histology of tapinocephalid jaws and incisors to assess adaptations to herbivory. Our results yield new dental characters for tapinocephalids including a peculiar enamel structure and reduced enamel deposition on the occlusal surface. These traits are convergent with other specialized herbivorous dentitions like those found in ornithischian dinosaurs and ungulates. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that while acquiring some specializations, tapinocephalids also retained plesiomorphic traits like alternate, continuous replacement. We interpret these findings as an example of how different combinations of traits can facilitate a derived and specialized dentition and then discuss their implications in the acquisition of a mammal-like dentition."
https://openalex.org/W2982576087,"While substantial task-related neural activity has been observed during motor tasks in rodent primary motor cortex and premotor cortex, the long-term stability of these responses in healthy rats is uncertain, limiting the interpretability of longitudinal changes in the specific patterns of neural activity associated with learning or motor recovery following injury. This study examined the stability of task-related neural activity associated with execution of two distinct reaching tasks in healthy rodents. A novel automated rodent behavioral apparatus was constructed and rats were trained to perform a reaching task combining a ‘gross’ lever press and a ‘fine’ pellet retrieval. In each animal, two chronic microelectrode arrays were implanted in motor cortex spanning the caudal forelimb area (rodent primary motor cortex) and the rostral forelimb area (rodent premotor cortex). We recorded multiunit spiking and local field potential activity from 10 days to 7–10 weeks post-implantation to characterize the patterns of neural activity observed during each task component and analyzed the consistency of channel-specific task-related neural activity. Task-related changes in neural activity were observed on the majority of channels. While the task-related changes in multi-unit spiking and local field potential spectral power were consistent over several weeks, spectral power changes were more stable, despite the trade-off of decreased spatial and temporal resolution. These results show that neural activity in rodent primary and premotor cortex is associated with specific phases of reaching movements with stable patterns of task-related activity across time, establishing the relevance of the rodent for future studies designed to examine changes in task-related neural activity during recovery from focal cortical lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2982595864,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic red cell disorder associated with multiple vascular complications, microvessel injury and wound-healing deficiency. Although stem cell transplantation with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) can promote wound healing and tissue repair in SCD patients, therapeutic efficacy is largely dependent on the paracrine activity of the implanted BM stromal cells. Since in vitro expansion and culture conditions are known to modulate the innate characteristics of BMSCs, the present study investigated the effects of normoxic and hypoxic cell-culture preconditioning on the BMSC secretome, in addition to the expression of paracrine molecules that induce angiogenesis and skin regeneration. BMSCs derived from SCD patients were submitted to culturing under normoxic (norCM) and hypoxic (hypoCM) conditions. We found that hypoxically conditioned cells presented increased expression and secretion of several well-characterized trophic growth factors (VEGF, IL8, MCP-1, ANG) directly linked to angiogenesis and tissue repair. The hypoCM secretome presented stronger angiogenic potential than norCM, both in vitro and in vivo, as evidenced by HUVEC proliferation, survival, migration, sprouting formation and in vivo angiogenesis. After local application in a murine wound-healing model, HypoCM showed significantly improved wound closure, as well as enhanced neovascularization in comparison to untreated controls. In sum, the secretome of hypoxia-preconditioned BMSC has increased expression of trophic factors involved in angiogenesis and skin regeneration. Considering that these preconditioned media are easily obtainable, this strategy represents an alternative to stem cell transplantation and could form the basis of novel therapies for vascular regeneration and wound healing in individuals with sickle cell disease."
https://openalex.org/W2982657274,"Ungulate populations face declines across the globe, and populations are commonly conserved by using protected areas. However, assessing the effectiveness of protected areas in conserving ungulate populations has remained difficult. Using herd size data from four years of line transect surveys and distance sampling models, we modeled population densities of four important herbivore species across a gradient of protection on the edge of Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park (SLNP) while accounting for the role of various ecological and anthropogenic variables. Our goal was to test whether protection was responsible for density dynamics in this protection gradient, and whether a hunting moratorium impacted herbivore densities during the studies. For all four species, we estimated lower densities in partially protected buffer areas adjacent to SLNP (ranging from 4.5-fold to 13.2-fold lower) compared to protected parklands. Density trends through the study period were species-specific, with some species increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable in all or some regions of the protection gradient. Surprisingly, when controlling for other covariates, we found that these observed differences were not always detectably related to the level of protection or year. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for variables beyond strata of interest in evaluating the effectiveness of a protected area. This study highlights the importance of comprehensively modeling ungulate population density across protection gradients, identifies lands within an important protection gradient for targeted conservation and monitoring, documents prey depletion and expands our understanding on the drivers in a critical buffer area in Zambia."
https://openalex.org/W2982530256,"We compared the distribution and occurrence of 15 carnivore species with data collected monthly over three years by trained native trackers using both sign surveys and an encounter-based, visual-distance method in a well-preserved region of southern Guyana (Amazon / Guiana Shield). We found that a rigorously applied sign-based method was sufficient to describe the status of most carnivore species populations, including rare species such as jaguar and bush dog. We also found that even when accumulation curves for direct visual encounter data reached an asymptote, customarily an indication that sufficient sampling has occurred to describe populations, animal occurrence and distribution were grossly underestimated relative to the results of sign data. While other researchers have also found that sign are better than encounters or camera traps for large felids, our results are important in documenting the failure of even intensive levels of effort to raise encounter rates sufficiently to enable statistical analysis, and in describing the relationship between encounter and sign data for an entire community of carnivores including felids, canids, procyonids, and mustelids."
https://openalex.org/W2982668963,"Insufficient and delayed fracture healing remain significant public health problems with limited therapeutic options. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, a major pathway involved in regulation of fracture healing, promotes proliferation, migration, and differentiation of osteoprogenitors. We have recently reported that knock-in mice with a global increase in PI3K signaling (gCblYF) show enhanced femoral fracture healing characterized by an extraordinary periosteal response to injury. Interestingly, of all growth factor receptors involved in fracture healing, PI3K directly binds only to PDGFR. Given these findings, we hypothesized a PDGFR-PI3K interaction is necessary for mediating robust periosteal cell activation following fracture. In this study, we isolated primary periosteal cells from gCblYF mice to analyze cross-talk between the PDGFRβ and PI3K signaling pathways. We found PDGFRβ signaling contributes to robust Akt phosphorylation in periosteal cells in comparison with other growth factor signaling pathways. Additionally, we performed femoral fractures on gCblYF mice with a conditional removal of PDGFRβ in mesenchymal progenitors using inducible alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) CreERT2 mice. Our studies showed that depletion of PDGFRβ signaling within these progenitors in the early phase of fracture healing significantly abrogates PI3K-mediated periosteal activation and proliferation three days after fracture. Combined, these results suggest that PDGFRβ signaling through PI3K is necessary for robust periosteal activation in the earliest phases of fracture healing."
https://openalex.org/W2982348744,"The aim of this paper is to derive an index able to indicate if a discount function exhibits increasing or decreasing impatience, and, even, in the last case, whether the decreasing impatience is moderate or strong. Moreover, it will be shown that the sign of this indicator coincides with the sign of the convexity index of the discount function when only considering the cases of increasing and decreasing impatience. Consequently, this parameter supposes an improvement of Prelec’s index of convexity. The main advantage of this novel measure is that, the same as Prelec’s index, it uses the differential calculus and, moreover, can be easily plotted by showing the changes from a type of impatience to another one according to time."
https://openalex.org/W2982535164,"There is a paucity of empiric data evaluating whether Tuberculosis (TB) is a useful surrogate measure for Universal Health Coverage (UHC), despite recognition of the importance of TB control efforts as part of the broader UHC agenda. We hypothesized that indicators of TB burden and coverage are sensitive tracers of UHC, when compared to other disease-specific indicators of service provision.Linear regression models were used to determine the extent to which variability in UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) was accounted for by (1) TB incidence rates and (2) TB mortality rates across 183 countries. Dominance analyses, stratifying countries by World Bank income criteria and TB burden, were used to determine the importance of TB treatment coverage in predicting UHC SCI scores, relative to other disease-specific indicators of service provision.Across 183 countries, TB incidence rate and TB mortality rate were negatively correlated, with UHC SCI score, (r = -0.67 and r = -0.74, respectively). In linear regression models including all 183 countries, TB incidence rates explained 45% of the variability in SCI scores; TB mortality rate explained 55% of variability. Restricting models to the 30 highest TB burden countries, both incidence and mortality explained less of the variability in SCI score (16% and 36%, respectively). In dominance analysis, comparing 13 disease-specific indicators of service provision, TB effective treatment coverage, ranked ninth overall. In dominance analysis stratified by TB burden, the TB treatment coverage estimate was ranked ninth in the 30 high burden countries and sixth in the 153 non-high burden countries. In separate analyses stratified by world bank income status, TB coverage ranked as third most important variable in LICs and fifth in LMICs and UMICs, but was less important in analysis restricted HICs (ranked seventh).Compared to other disease-specific indicators of service provision, TB coverage was an important indicator of overall UHC service coverage, especially in low-income countries. These findings highlight that national-level inequities in TB-coverage may be an important tracer of universal health coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2982562464,"All languages borrow words from other languages. Some languages are more prone to borrowing, while others borrow less, and different domains of the vocabulary are unequally susceptible to borrowing. Languages typically borrow words when a new concept is introduced, but languages may also borrow a new word for an already existing concept. Linguists describe two causalities for borrowing: need, i.e., the internal pressure of borrowing a new term for a concept in the language, and prestige, i.e., the external pressure of borrowing a term from a more prestigious language. We investigate lexical loans in a dataset of 104 concepts in 115 Eurasian languages from 7 families occupying a coherent contact area of the Eurasian landmass, of which Indo-European languages from various periods constitute a majority. We use a cognacy-coded dataset, which identifies loan events including a source and a target language. To avoid loans for newly introduced concepts in languages, we use a list of lexical concepts that have been in use at least since the Chalcolithic (4000–3000 BCE). We observe that the rates of borrowing are highly variable among concepts, lexical domains, languages, language families, and time periods. We compare our results to those of a global sample and observe that our rates are generally lower, but that the rates between the samples are significantly correlated. To test the causality of borrowing, we use two different ranks. Firstly, to test need, we use a cultural ranking of concepts by their mobility (of nature items) or their labour intensity and “distance-from-hearth” (of culture items). Secondly, to test prestige, we use a power ranking of languages by their socio-cultural status. We conclude that the borrowability of concepts increases with increasing mobility (nature), and with increased labour intensity and “distance-from-hearth” (culture). We also conclude that language prestige is not correlated with borrowability in general (all languages borrow, independently of prestige), but prestige predicts the directionality of borrowing, from a more prestigious language to a less prestigious one. The process is not constant over time, with a larger inequality during the ancient and modern periods, but this result may depend on the status of the data (non-prestigious languages often remain unattested). In conclusion, we observe that need and prestige compete as causes of lexical borrowing."
https://openalex.org/W2982297357,"Tobacco smoking causes cardiovascular diseases, lung disease, and various cancers. Understanding the population-based characteristics associated with smoking and the cause of death is important to improve survival. This study sought to evaluate the differential impact of smoking on cardiac or non-cardiac death according to age. Data from 514,866 healthy adults who underwent national health screening in South Korea were analyzed. The participants were divided into three groups: never-smoker, ex-smoker or current smoker according to the smoking status. The incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) of cardiac or non-cardiac deaths according to smoking status and age groups during the 10-year follow-up were calculated to evaluate the differential risk of smoking. Over the follow-up period, 6,192 and 24,443 cardiac and non-cardiac deaths had occurred, respectively. The estimated incidence rate of cardiac and non-cardiac death gradually increased in older age groups and was higher in current smokers and ex-smokers than that in never-smokers among all age groups. After adjustment of covariates, the HRs for cardiac death of current smokers compared to never-smokers were the highest in individuals in their 40's (1.82; 95% CI, 1.45-2.28); this gradually decreased to 0.96 (95% CI, 0.67-1.38) in individuals >80 years. In contrast, the HRs for non-cardiac death peaked in individuals in their 50's, (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.57-1.82) and was sustained in those >80 years (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.17-1.69). Ex-smokers did not show elevated risk of cardiac death compared to never-smokers in any age group, whereas they showed significantly higher risk of non-cardiac death in their 60's and 70's (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.19-1.39; HR 1.22, 95% CI, 1.12-1.32, respectively). Acute myocardial infarction and lung cancer showed patterns similar to those of cardiac and non-cardiac death, respectively. Smoking was associated with higher relative risk of cardiac death in the middle-aged group and non-cardiac death in the older age group. Ex-smokers in the older age group had elevated risk of non-cardiac death. To prevent early cardiac death and late non-cardiac death, smoking cessation should be emphasized as early as possible."
https://openalex.org/W2982298266,"Basic bovine behavior is a crucial parameter influencing cattle domestication. In addition, behavior has an impact on cattle productivity, welfare and adaptation. The aim of the present study was to infer quantitative genetic and genomic mechanisms contributing to natural dual-purpose cow behavior in grazing systems. In this regard, we genotyped five dual-purpose breeds for a dense SNP marker panel from four different European countries. All cows from the across-country study were equipped with the same electronic recording devices. In this regard, we analyzed 97,049 longitudinal sensor behavior observations from 319 local dual-purpose cows for rumination, feeding, basic activity, high active, not active and ear temperature. According to the specific sensor behaviors and following a welfare protocol, we computed two different welfare indices. For genomic breed characterizations and multi-breed genome-wide association studies, sensor traits and test-day production records were merged with 35,826 SNP markers per cow. For the estimation of variance components, we used the pedigree relationship matrix and a combined similarity matrix that simultaneously included both pedigree and genotypes. Heritabilities for feeding, high active and not active were in a moderate range from 0.16 to 0.20. Estimates were very similar from both relationship matrix-modeling approaches and had quite small standard errors. Heritabilities for the remaining sensor traits (feeding, basic activity, ear temperature) and welfare indices were lower than 0.09. Five significant SNPs on chromosomes 11, 17, 27 and 29 were associated with rumination, and two different SNPs significantly influenced the sensor traits ""not active"" (chromosome 13) and ""feeding"" (chromosome 23). Gene annotation analyses inferred 22 potential candidate genes with a false discovery rate lower than 20%, mostly associated with rumination (13 genes) and feeding (8 genes). Mendelian randomization based on genomic variants (i.e., the instrumental variables) was used to infer causal inference between an exposure and an outcome. Significant regression coefficients among behavior traits indicate that all specific behavioral mechanisms contribute to similar physiological processes. The regression coefficients of rumination and feeding on milk yield were 0.10 kg/% and 0.12 kg/%, respectively, indicating their positive influence on dual-purpose cow productivity. Genomically, an improved welfare behavior of grazing cattle, i.e., a higher score for welfare indices, was significantly associated with increased fat and protein percentages."
https://openalex.org/W2982456197,"Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) is a neurodegenerative disease with no approved therapy that is the result of frataxin deficiency. The identification of human FA blood biomarkers related to disease severity and neuro-pathomechanism could support clinical trials of drug efficacy. To try to identify human biomarkers of neuro-pathomechanistic relevance, we compared the overlapping gene expression changes of primary blood and skin cells of FA patients with changes in the Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) of the KIKO FA mouse model. As DRG is the primary site of neurodegeneration in FA, our goal was to identify which changes in blood and skin of FA patients provide a 'window' into the FA neuropathomechanism inside the nervous system. In addition, gene expression in frataxin-deficient neuroglial cells and FA mouse hearts were compared for a total of 5 data sets. The overlap of these changes strongly supports mitochondrial changes, apoptosis and alterations of selenium metabolism. Consistent biomarkers were observed, including three genes of mitochondrial stress (MTIF2, ENO2), apoptosis (DDIT3/CHOP), oxidative stress (PREX1), and selenometabolism (SEPW1). These results prompted our investigation of the GPX1 activity as a marker of selenium and oxidative stress, in which we observed a significant change in FA patients. We believe these lead biomarkers that could be assayed in FA patient blood as indicators of disease severity and progression, and also support the involvement of mitochondria, apoptosis and selenium in the neurodegenerative process."
https://openalex.org/W2982509858,"In the United States, National Guard soldiers have been called upon at unprecedented rates since 2001 to supplement active duty military forces. Frequent military deployments generate many occupational and environmental stressors for these citizen-soldiers, from serving in a dangerous zone to being away from family and home for long periods of time. Whereas there is a substantial amount of research focused on deployment-related health outcomes in relation to active duty (i.e., full-time) military populations, reserve forces are less understood. This study focuses on a United States Army National Guard combat unit deployed to Afghanistan. This prospective longitudinal study was conducted over the course an operational deployment cycle (i.e., before, during, and after) to document the evolution of salient mental health outcomes (i.e., post-traumatic stress, depression, general anxiety, and aggression). The findings show that both combat (e.g., killing others) and non-combat (e.g., boredom) stressors negatively affect mental health outcomes, and the severity of these outcomes increases over the course of a deployment cycle. Of special note, the study reveals key gender differences in the evolution of post-traumatic stress (PTS), depression, and anxiety across a deployment cycle: females report increased PTS, depression, and anxiety 6 months post-deployment, whereas the levels reported by males stabilize at their mid-deployment levels. The findings offer insights for medical providers and policymakers in developing more targeted health promotion campaigns and interventions, especially at the post-deployment phase."
https://openalex.org/W2982580362,"Climate change is affecting interactions among species, including host-parasite interactions. The effects of warming are of particular interest for interactions in which parasite and host physiology are intertwined, such as those between parasitic plants and their hosts. However, little is known about how warming will affect plant parasitic interactions, hindering our ability to predict how host and parasite species will respond to climate change. Here, we test how warming affects aboveground and belowground biomass of a hemiparasitic species (Castilleja sulphurea) and its host (Bouteloua gracilis), asking whether the effects of warming depend on the interaction between these species. We also measured how warming affected the number of haustorial connections between parasite and host. We grew each species alone and together under ambient and warmed conditions. Hosts produced more belowground biomass under warming. However, host biomass was reduced when plants were grown with a hemiparasite. Thus, parasitism negated the benefit of warming on belowground growth of the host. Host resource allocation to roots versus shoots also changed in response to both interaction with the parasite and warming, with hosts producing more root biomass relative to shoot biomass when grown with a parasite and when warmed. As expected, hemiparasite biomass was greater when grown with a host. Warmed parasites had lower root:shoot ratios but only when grown with a host. Under elevated temperatures, hemiparasite aboveground biomass was marginally greater, and plants produced significantly more haustoria. These findings indicate that warming can influence biomass production, both by modifying the interaction between host plants and hemiparasites and by affecting the growth of each species directly. To predict how species will be affected, it is important to understand not only the direct effects of warming but also the indirect effects that are mediated by species interactions. Ultimately, understanding how climate change will affect species interactions is key to understanding how it will affect individual species."

Design Register-based descriptive study. Participants All children born in Denmark in the period 1994–2016 followed until 5 years of age. Main outcome measures Annual incidence rates of mortality and health service utilisation outcomes, and incidence rate ratios compared to the reference calendar year 1999. The new measure of post-discharge mortality is presented. Results Post-discharge mortality decreased from 1999 to 2016, IRR2016 = 0.49 (95% CI: 0.36 to 0.66). Total contacts did not change much over time, IRR2016 = 1.02 (1.02 to 1.03), but increased among neonates, IRR2016 = 3.69 (3.63 to 3.75), and decreased among children with chronic disease IRR2016 = 0.94 (0.93 to 0.94). In- and out-patient hospitalisations increased, IRR2016 = 1.26 (1.24–1.27) resp. IRR2016 = 1.62 (1.60–1.63), contacts with medical specialists increased, IRR2016 = 1.43 (1.42 to 1.43), whilst contacts with general practitioner decreased, IRR2016 = 0.91 (0.91 to 0.91). Medication use decreased, IRR2016 = 0.82 (0.82 to 0.82). Conclusions Our measure of post-discharge mortality was halved during the study period indicating improved health. Overall health service utilisation did not change much, but the type of utilisation changed, and the development over time differed between subgroups defined by age and chronic disease status. Our findings call for considerations about the benefit of increased specialisation and increased use of health services among ‘healthy’ children not suffering from chronic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2982464487,"Polymorphic variants of the gene encoding for metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGlu3) are linked to schizophrenia. Because abnormalities of cortical GABAergic interneurons lie at the core of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, we examined whether mGlu3 receptors influence the developmental trajectory of cortical GABAergic transmission in the postnatal life. mGlu3-/- mice showed robust changes in the expression of interneuron-related genes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including large reductions in the expression of parvalbumin (PV) and the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors. The number of cortical cells enwrapped by perineuronal nets was increased in mGlu3-/- mice, suggesting that mGlu3 receptors shape the temporal window of plasticity of PV+ interneurons. Electrophysiological measurements of GABAA receptor-mediated responses revealed a more depolarized reversal potential of GABA currents in the somata of PFC pyramidal neurons in mGlu3-/- mice at postnatal d 9 associated with a reduced expression of the K+/Cl- symporter. Finally, adult mGlu3-/- mice showed lower power in electroencephalographic rhythms at 1-45 Hz in quiet wakefulness as compared with their wild-type counterparts. These findings suggest that mGlu3 receptors have a strong impact on the development of cortical GABAergic transmission and cortical neural synchronization mechanisms corroborating the concept that genetic variants of mGlu3 receptors may predispose to psychiatric disorders.-Imbriglio, T., Verhaeghe, R., Martinello, K., Pascarelli, M.

By pouring liquid paint with the help of a stick or from a can, Pollock deposited viscous fluid filaments on a horizontal canvas, rhythmically moving around it. The intricate webs of lines, ubiquitous in his compositions, have fascinated art historians and scientists. Based on image analysis of historical video recordings, we experimentally reproduced the painting process. We conclude that Pollock avoided the appearance of the hydrodynamic instabilities, contrary to what was argued by previous studies. Pollock selected the physical properties of the paint to prevent filament fragmentation before deposition, and applied it while moving his hand sufficiently fast and at certain heights to avoid fluid filaments from coiling into themselves. An understanding of the physical conditions at which these patterns were created is important to further art research and it can be used as a tool in the authentication of paintings."

Some evidence shows high loss to follow-up (LTF) under this model. However, gaps in data systems limit this evidence. We collected additional information for women and infants LTF from Option B+ in Eswatini to assess more accurate outcomes. Methods LTF at 6-months postpartum was assessed using facility data. Additional data was gathered from: 1) the national ART database and paper records; 2) patient tracing; and 3) interviews and abstraction from patient-held records. Engagement in care was defined as any clinic visit within 91 days before or after 6-months postpartum or completion of a documented transfer; or, for those traced but not completing study interviews, visits at 6-months postpartum or later (for infants), or visits within 3-months of tracing (for women). Multivariable loglinear models were used to identify correlates of engagement. Results One-hundred-ninety-four (44.7%) of 434 LTF women had outcomes ascertained, including 122 (62.9%) women engaged in care. Among 510 LTF infants, 265 (52.0%) had ascertained outcomes, including 143 (54.0%) engaged in care, 47 (17.7%) pregnancy losses, and 18 (6.8%) deaths. Seventy-two of 189 live infants (38.1%) with ascertained outcomes had a 6-week early infant diagnostic (EID) test. Among women with ascertained outcomes, gestational age of 20+ weeks (vs. fewer than 20 weeks, aRR 0.80; 95% CI 0.68–0.94) and age 25–29 years (vs. 15–24 years, aRR 0.81; 95% CI 0.67–0.97), were associated with lower engagement; initiating ART after first ANC visit was associated with higher engagement (vs. at first ANC visit, aRR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04–1.21). Among infants with ascertained outcomes, mother not initiating ART was associated with lower engagement (vs. ART at first ANC visit, aRR 0.71; 95% CI 0.54–0.91). Conclusion Substantial numbers of women and infants classified as LTF under Option B+ were engaged in care, though a suboptimal level of 6-week EID testing was observed. These findings highlight a need to improve coverage of routine EID testing, and improve data systems to better capture PMTCT patient outcomes."

Only 21 bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) grow now in the immediate vicinity of the 5,300 year old Iceman discovery site at 3,210m above sea level in the Ötztal Alps, Italy. By contrast 75 or more species including at least ten liverworts were recovered as subfossils frozen in, on and around the Iceman from before, at and after his time. About two thirds of the species grow in the nival zone (above 3,000m above sea level) now while about one third do not. A large part of this third can be explained by the Iceman having both deliberately and inadvertently carried bryophytes during his last, fatal journey. Multivariate analyses (PCA, RDA) provide a variety of explanations for the arrivals of the bryophytes in the rocky hollow where the mummy was discovered. This is well into the nival zone of perennial snow and ice with a very sparse, non-woody flora and very low vegetation cover. Apart from the crucial anthropochory (extra-local plants), both hydrochory (local species) and zoochory (by wild game such as ibex of both local and extra-local species) have been important. Anemochory of mainly local species was of lesser importance and of extra-local species probably of little or no importance. The mosses Neckera complanata and several other ecologically similar species as well as a species of Sphagnum (bogmoss) strongly support the claim that the Iceman, took northwards up Schnalstal, South Tyrol, as the route of the last journey.

MR13A10A, generic rocuronium with a novel solution, reduced the injection-induced withdrawal reflex in rodents. We hypothesized that MR13A10A would reduce the frequency and severity of injection-induced withdrawal reflexes compared with original rocuronium during clinical anesthesia induction.This prospective, open (but assessor-blinded), randomized, controlled study was conducted at a single academic hospital. The assessor was blinded to the study condition in order to minimize observer bias. Participants were allocated to either MR13A10A or traditional formula groups by a blocked stratified randomization method. Participants in the MR13A10A group received MR13A10A, whereas the original rocuronium group received the same amount of original rocuronium. The primary outcome was presence of the withdrawal reflex after rocuronium injection. Severity of the withdrawal reflex, changes in blood pressure and heart rate, and the train of four (TOF) ratio were measured as secondary outcomes. The withdrawal reflex was assessed using a video recording in a blinded manner.Of the 149 participants, 76 were allocated to the MR13A10A group and 73 to the original rocuronium group. The frequency of the withdrawal reflex was significantly lower with MR13A10A compared with original rocuronium (19.7% and 54.8% for MR13A10A and original rocuronium groups, respectively, p<0.001). The odds ratio adjusted for cannulation site, cannula size, induction agent and age was 6.27 (95% CI, 2.87, 13.73 p<0.001). Original rocuronium was an independent factor related to a higher post-treatment heart rate. The proportions of TOF ratios = 0 were similar between the two groups.The frequency and severity of the withdrawal reflex after injection were significantly reduced by using MR13A10A. MR13A10A might contribute to safe and less invasive anesthesia management."
https://openalex.org/W2982617993,"Calculators are often unnecessary to solve routine problems, though they are convenient for offloading cognitively effortful processes. However, errors can arise if incorrect procedures are used or when users fail to monitor the output for keystroke mistakes. To investigate the conditions under which people's attention are captured by errant calculator outputs (i.e., from incorrectly chosen procedures or keystroke errors), we programmed an onscreen calculator to ""lie"" by changing the answers displayed on certain problems. We measured suspicion by tracking whether users explicitly reported suspicion, overrode calculator ""lies"", or re-checked their calculations after a ""lie"" was presented. In Study 1, we manipulated the concreteness of problem presentation and calculator delay between subjects to test how these affect suspicion towards ""lies"" (15% added to answers). We found that numeracy had no effect on whether people opted-in or out of using the calculator but did predict whether they would become suspicious. Very few people showed suspicion overall, however. For study 2, we increased the ""lies"" to 120% on certain answers and included questions with ""conceptual lies"" shown (e.g., a negative sign that should have been positive). We again found that numeracy had no effect on calculator usage, but, along with concrete formatting, did predict suspicion behavior. This was found regardless of ""lie"" type. For study 3, we reproduced these effects after offering students an incentive for good performance, which did raise their accuracy across the math problems overall but did not increase suspicion behavior. We conclude that framing problems within a concrete domain and being higher in numeracy increases the likelihood of spotting errant calculator outputs, regardless of incentive."

https://openalex.org/W2982340893,"What role does children’s trust in communication play in their acquisition of new meanings? To answer, we report two experimental studies (N = 81) testing how three- to four-year-olds interpret the meaning of a novel communicative device when it is used by a malevolent and potentially deceptive informant. Children participated in a hiding game in which they had to find a reward hidden in one of two boxes. In the initial phase of the experiments, a malevolent informant always indicated the location of the empty box using a novel communicative device, either a marker (Study 1), or an arrow (Study 2). During that phase, 3- and 4-year-olds learned to avoid the box indicated by the novel communicative device. In the second phase of the test, the malevolent informant was replaced by a benevolent one. Nevertheless, children did not change their search strategy, and they kept avoiding the box tagged by the novel communicative device as often as when it had been produced by the malevolent informant. These results suggest that during the initial phase, children (i) did not consider the possibility that the malevolent informant might intend to deceive them, and (ii) did not ignore the unfamiliar communicative signal or treat it as irrelevant. Instead, children relied on the unfamiliar communicative signal to locate the empty box’s location. These results suggest that children’s avoidance of the location indicated by an unfamiliar signal is not unambiguous evidence for distrust of such signal. We argue that children’s trust in ostensive communication is likely to extend to unfamiliar communicative means, and that this presumption of trustworthiness plays a central role in children’s acquisition of new meanings."
https://openalex.org/W2982463684,"Students in many western countries struggle to achieve acceptable standards in numeracy despite its recognition as an important 21st century skill. As commercial math programs remain a staple of classroom instruction, investigations of their effectiveness are essential to inform decision-making regarding how to invest limited resources while maximizing student gains. We conducted a cluster randomized-controlled trial of the effectiveness of JUMP Math, a distinctive math program whose central tenets are empirically supported, for improving elementary math achievement (clinical trial.gov no. NCT02456181). The study involved 554 grade 2 (primary) and 592 grade 5 (junior) students and 193 teachers in 41 schools, in an urban-rural Canadian school board. Schools were randomly assigned to use either JUMP Math or their business-as-usual, problem-based approach to math instruction. We tracked student progress in math achievement on standardized and curriculum-based measures of computation and problem solving, for 2 consecutive school years. Junior students taught with JUMP Math made significantly greater progress in computation than their non-JUMP peers but the groups did not differ significantly in problem solving. Effects took hold relatively quickly, replicating the results from an earlier pilot study. Primary students in the non-JUMP group made significantly greater gains in problem solving and computation in year 1. But those taught with JUMP Math made significantly greater gains in problem solving and the groups did not differ in computation, in year 2. The positive effects of JUMP Math are noteworthy given that the JUMP Math teachers were likely still adjusting to the new program. That these positive findings were obtained in an effectiveness study (i.e. in real-world conditions), suggests that JUMP Math may be a valuable evidence-based addition to the teacher's toolbox. Given the importance of numeracy for 21st century functioning, identifying and implementing effective math instruction programs could have far-reaching, positive implications."
https://openalex.org/W2938013520,"In this work we investigate how future actions are influenced by the previous ones, in the specific contexts of scientific collaborations and friendships on social networks. We describe the activity of the agents, providing a model for the formation of the bipartite network of actions and their features. Therefore we only require to know the chronological order in which the actions are performed, and not the order in which the agents are observed. Moreover, the total number of possible features is not specified a priori but is allowed to increase along time, and new actions can independently show some new-entry features or exhibit some of the old ones. The choice of the old features is driven by a degree-fitness method: indeed, the probability that a new action shows one of the old features does not solely depend on the popularity of that feature (i.e. the number of previous actions showing it), but it is also affected by some individual traits of the agents or the features themselves, synthesized in certain quantities, called fitnesses or weights, that can have different forms and different meaning according to the specific setting considered. We show some theoretical properties of the model and provide statistical tools for the parameters' estimation. The model has been tested on three different datasets and the numerical results are provided and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2982464131,"Information barriers are trusted measurement systems to confirm the authenticity of nuclear warheads based on their radiation signatures. Traditional inspection systems rely on complex electronics both for data acquisition and processing. Several research efforts have produced prototype systems, but it has proven difficult to demonstrate that hidden switches and side channels do not exist. After almost thirty years of research and development, no viable and widely accepted system has emerged. We pursue a fundamentally different approach: Our prototype of an inspection system uses vintage hardware built around a 6502 processor. The processor uses 8-micron technology and has only about 4,200 transistors. Vintage electronics may have a number of important advantages for applications where two parties need to simultaneously establish trust in the hardware used. CPUs designed in the distant past, at a time when their use for sensitive measurements was never envisioned, drastically reduce concerns that the other party implemented backdoors or hidden switches on the hardware level. We demonstrate the performance of a prototype system using an Apple IIe and a custom-made open-source data-processing board connected to a standard sodium-iodide radiation detector for low-resolution gamma spectroscopy. Data processing and analysis is exclusively done on the Apple IIe hardware. We show that subtle differences in radiation signatures can be detected in 2-3 minutes based on the result of a simple chi-squared test. Vintage electronics may therefore offer a new path toward fieldable, trusted information barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2982573044,"Dengue infection (DI) is the most important arboviral infection in the world. The majority of immunocompetent patients will have asymptomatic or mild infections, but the degree of dengue severity in kidney transplant recipients (KTx) is unknown. In this study, we report the clinical profile and outcomes of 39 dengue cases in KTx. From a total of 1,186 KTx outpatients in follow-up we reviewed clinical and laboratory records of 60 (5%) patients admitted with suspected DI initially screened by NS-1, IgM, and when possible, multiplex nested PCR. The prevalence of DI in KTx was 3% (39/1,118), with symptoms leading to hospital admission being fever, myalgia, malaise, and headache. Laboratory tests showed leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and liver enzyme elevation. DI was confirmed by positivity of NS-1 (33%), IgM (69%), and/or RT-PCR (59%). Twenty-three patients (59%) had dengue with warning signs, and 15% had severe dengue, 2 of them with a fatal course. Acute graft dysfunction occurred in 59% (mean nadir serum creatinine: 2.9 ± 2.6mg/dL), 4 of them requiring dialysis. CMV coinfection diagnosed in 19% of the cases and patients was associated with worse clinical presentation. Our results suggest that KTx with DI presented initial physical and laboratorial profile similar to the general population. However, DI in KTx seems to have a higher risk for graft dysfunction, severe dengue, and death. Because CMV coinfection aggravates the DI clinical presentation and recovery, it must be evaluated in all cases."
https://openalex.org/W2895075025,"The number of votes correlates strongly with the money spent in a campaign, but the relation between the two is not straightforward. Among other factors, the output of a ballot depends on the number of candidates, voters, and available resources. Here, we develop a conceptual framework based on Shannon entropy maximization and Superstatistics to establish a relation between the distributions of money spent by candidates and their votes. By establishing such a relation, we provide a tool to predict the outcome of a ballot and to alert for possible misconduct either in the report of fundraising and spending of campaigns or on vote counting. As an example, we consider real data from a proportional election with $6323$ candidates, where a detailed data verification is virtually impossible, and show that the number of potential misconducting candidates to audit can be reduced to only nine."
https://openalex.org/W2982440286,"Background and objectives Human motor control (HMC) has been hypothesized to involve state estimation, prediction and feedback control to overcome noise, delays and disturbances. However, the nature of communication between these processes, and, in particular, whether it is continuous or intermittent, is still an open issue. Depending on the nature of communication, the resulting control is referred to as continuous control (CC) or intermittent control (IC). While standard HMC theories are based on CC, IC has been argued to be more viable since it reduces computational and communication burden and agrees better with some experimental results. However, to be a feasible model for HMC, IC has to cope well with inaccurately modeled plants, which are common in daily life, as when lifting lighter than expected loads. While IC may involve event-driven triggering, it is generally assumed that refractory mechanisms in HMC set a lower limit on the interval between triggers. Hence, we focus on periodic IC, which addresses this lower limit and also facilitates analysis. Theoretical methods and results Theoretical stability criteria are derived for CC and IC of inaccurately modeled linear time-invariant systems with and without delays. Considering a simple muscle-actuated hand model with inaccurately modeled load, both CC and IC remain stable over most of the investigated range, and may become unstable only when the actual load is much smaller than expected, usually smaller than the minimum set by the actual mass of the forearm and hand. Neither CC nor IC is consistently superior to the other in terms of the range of loads over which the system remains stable. Numerical methods and results Numerical simulations of time-delayed reaching movements are presented and analyzed to evaluate the effects of model inaccuracies when the control and observer gains are time-dependent, as is assumed to occur in HMC. Both IC and CC agree qualitatively with previously published experimental results with inaccurately modeled plants. Thus, our study suggests that IC copes well with inaccurately modeled plants and is indeed a viable model for HMC."
