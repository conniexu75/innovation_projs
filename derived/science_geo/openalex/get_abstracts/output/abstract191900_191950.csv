https://openalex.org/W2000555463,"IT has often been stated that the colour-producing reaction between creatinine and alkaline picrate does not obey Beer's law1–3. This implies that a calibration graph relating creatinine concentration to light extinction is not a straight line. Curves have been obtained with photoelectric absorptiometers using filters which pass an appreciable band of wavelengths, for example, 495–550 mµ4."

https://openalex.org/W1968188222,"ALTHOUGH numerous investigators have shown that molybdenum is important for the utilization of nitrate nitrogen by fungi and higher plants1,2, the role of the micronutrient element in the enzyme systems involved has not been determined. We have recently been able to show that the concentrations of nitrate reductase in cell-free extracts of molybdenum-deficient Neurospora and Aspergillus are markedly decreased to the extent of one-fifth to one-thirtieth of that of normal tissue. However, the nitrite activity, designated as nitrite reductase3, of these extracts was significantly increased in Neurospora (5297a) and Aspergillus compared to that of the controls."

https://openalex.org/W1965415116,"THE behaviour of polymethyl methacrylate (‘Perspex’) when exposed to high-energy radiation is markedly different from that of many other longchain polymers such as ‘Polythene’ and polystyrene1. These latter develop cross-links forming a thermosetting material, whereas polymethyl methacrylate shows rapid breakdown after relatively short radiation doses. The nature of the changes produced is complex, and appears to vary with the temperature as well as the radiation dose."

https://openalex.org/W2044181188,"IN preparing hydrolysates of polysaccharides for paper chromatography, it has always been considered necessary to neutralize the sulphuric acid with barium carbonate before applying the solution to the paper, as the acid causes disturbing stains. Indeed, when using an ammoniacal silver spray, white stains appear at the place where the spots of glucose and galactose should be; but the flow of the sugars does not seem to be disturbed."

https://openalex.org/W2055660805,"DEFECTS in nutrition which predispose to osteodystrophic conditions in the horse include a dietary deficiency of phosphorus1 or disturbance in the vitamin D – calcium – phosphorus relationship. With regard to the influence of trace minerals, Davis2 found that the presence of small amounts of molybdenum, ranging from 2 to 25 p.p.m. in young growing herbage, was associated with defective bone metabolism in herbivora, consequent on the effects of molybdenum on the utilization of both phosphorus and copper. More recently, Arrington and Davis3 in limited phosphorus metabolism studies with rabbits reported that molybdenum decreased phosphorus absorption while at the same time increasing the excretion of phosphorus."
https://openalex.org/W2049156102,"FREE asparagine has twice before been reported in animal tissues, namely, in the liver, kidney and spleen of sheep1, and, recently, in human urine2. The evidence given below shows that it is also present in the blood plasma of both man and the goat: the concentrations are, in fact, comparable to those of many other free amino-acids in blood plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1972106594,"DURING studies on the biosynthesis of adrenaline, both para- and meta-hydroxyphenylethanolamine have been found to form noradrenaline following ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of air1. Whereas the para compound has been identified in Octopus vulgaris2, the meta compound has not hitherto been found occurring naturally. Their detection in biological materials is a major problem. With the aid of paper chromatography, using a solvent of butanol (4 vol.), glacial acetic acid (1 vol.) and water (5 vol.), we have found that the meta compound exhibits an intense violet fluorescence under ultra-violet light when the developing agent is a mixture of 9 vol. of a solution of either potassium ferricyanide or dichromate (0.66 per cent) and 1 vol. of formaldehyde (40 per cent), followed by exposure to heat (100° C.) for 5 min. As little as 0.5 µgm. (RF value 0.56) can be identified by this test. Development with the p-nitraniline reagent3 results in a dark red spot (similar to that produced with the para compound), but this test is only sensitive to 5 µgm."

https://openalex.org/W2010123912,"A NUMBER of clinical observations have established that recent immunization with diphtheria or whooping cough vaccines renders children more susceptible to poliomyelitis infection (see Hill and Knowelden1 for references). A similar effect has been demonstrated in mice infected with the virus of mouse encephalomyelitis (GDVII strain) in experiments which are being reported fully elsewhere. During the course of the work, however, it was observed that the injection of vaccines which had been stored for several months no longer made the mice more susceptible to virus infection, but instead exerted a protective effect. It is felt that these findings, if confirmed, might have an important bearing on both clinical and biological problems."

https://openalex.org/W2080460185,MANY workers have reported striking antagonism between plant pathogens and saprophytes. Most of this work has been done in pure culture or in soil partially or completely sterilized before introduction of the test organisms. There are comparatively few records of disease control under natural conditions by the introduction of an antagonistic organism.

https://openalex.org/W2004034885,"IN order to use thionyl chloride most effectively for the preparation of acyl chloride, RCO.Cl, a knowledge of the sequence of reactions occurring is desirable. Trichloroacetic acid reacts extremely slowly with thionyl chloride even at higher temperatures; but Carré and Libermann1 have shown that pyridine (1 mol.) helps the reaction. Mills and Human2 adopted the use of the base in the preparation of anilides and esters of the half-esters of phthalic acid. We have now shown that during the addition of the first half of the thionyl chloride (1 mol.) to an ethereal solution of cyclohexyl hydrogen phthalate (1 mol.) and pyridine (1 mol.), the following reactions occur: The second half of the thionyl chloride then converts the anhydride into the acyl chloride, and it was from the latter that Mills and Human obtained the anilide by adding the amine together with pyridine. Now the significant point is that although the formation of anhydride is very rapid3, the formation of acyl chloride from the anhydride is comparatively slow and requires a time which depends on the nature of R in the acyl group. It just happens that the anhydride of cyclohexyl hydrogen phthalate (the example quoted by Mills and Human) will give acyl chloride in yields approaching 80 per cent in the one hour of reaction time allowed by these workers; but the rate of formation of acyl chloride from the anhydride of 2-octyl hydrogen phthalate is definitely slower, and we were at a loss to account for the high yield of anilide reported by Mills and Human."

https://openalex.org/W2029867550,"THE rontgen is defined as “that quantity of X- or gamma-radiation such that the associated corpuscular emission per 0.001293 gm. of air produces, in air, ions carrying 1 e.s.u. of charge of either sign”. An ionization chamber designed for the realization of this unit must therefore provide sufficient space around the air volume in which the primary ionization occurs to permit the corpuscles from it full range, effectively. In the parallel-plate type of chamber, this involves not only sufficient electrode spacing, but also adequate dimensions at right angles, that is, lateral to the X-ray beam. It was recognized in the design of the typical standards set up more than twenty years ago in Great Britain1 and the United States2 that the actual electrode spacing need not be so great as might at first sight be thought necessary on theoretical grounds. Thus for 200-kV. X-rays, a plate spacing approaching 70 cm. (with effectively equal lateral dimensions) is theoretically desirable, whereas, in fact, the ionization losses with dimensions considerably less than these may be negligible. Thus 10 cm. only was adopted as the plate-spacing in the chamber set up at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, and 12 cm. in that at the U.S. Bureau of Standards."

https://openalex.org/W2095439080,"ISOLATED leaves are able to live independently in soil with root systems of their own induced from their petioles by the application of synthetic hormones1. Leaves of Amaranthus gangeticus, Linn. var. tristis were grown in soil with such root systems induced by an aqueous solution of β-indolyl butyric acid of the strength of five parts per million. After a month the petioles became thicker and stouter, and transverse sections, a photomicrograph of one of which is given in Fig. 1, revealed an anomalous type of secondary growth peculiar to the stem of the species. Fig. 2 depicts a transverse section of a petiole of a leaf of the same age attached to the plant and shows no secondary growth. Secondary growth is initiated outside the original vascular bundles by accessory cambium formed in distinct arcs. Small discrete groups of secondary xylem are cut off inwards and are embedded in parenchymatous conjunctive tissue whereas phloem is poorly developed. No interfascicular cambium is formed and secondary growth takes place within the primary bundles by the activation of the rudimentary fascicular cambium."
https://openalex.org/W1970678942,"IN a recent investigation, it proved virtually impossible to obtain a pure culture of Azotobacter chroococcum. After initial isolation from soil in flasks containing 2 per cent mannitol and 0.02 per cent sodium phosphate in tap water, progressive subcultures were made on solid nitrogen–free medium containing washed agar and the same percentages of mannitol and phosphate in distilled water—a recognized procedure for purifying Azotobacter1. Characteristic colonies of Azotobacter were obtained in about a month, and stained smear preparations of these colonies revealed only the characteristic large cells of the organism. If, however, colonies were inoculated into peptone water (in which Azotobacter will not grow2) a faint haze due to growth of small Gram-negative rods appeared after 24–48 hr. incubation at 22° C. A more abundant growth of these rods was obtained in 24 hr. on nutrient agar containing 0.1 per cent whole milk, whereas on this medium the growth of Azotobacter was very poor after three to four days. Subculture of Azotobacter on solid nitrogen-free medium (above) was therefore extended up to periods of four months, and 0.1 per cent sodium silicate, 0.002 per cent iron (FeCl3) and boron, 0.00004 per cent sodium molybdate, soil extract and hay-infusion were incorporated in some cultures to heighten the resistance of Azotobacter. In practically all cases, however, the contamination persisted. On the one or two occasions on which it appeared to be absent, growth of Azotobacterwas very poor, marked by absence of the characteristic mucilage, and ceased within seven to fourteen days; nor could it be restored by incorporation of any of the above substances. Fourteen strains of contaminants were isolated the cultural characters of which proved conclusively they were not pleomorphic forms of Azotobacter, the majority being strains of Pseudomonas (fluorescent and non-fluorescent) with one or two species of Achromobacter. In the absence of Azotobacter, they grow well up to four weeks in flasks of the above liquid mannitol medium, reducing its reaction to a pH of 4.0 in a fortnight although growth was still vigorous. Their source of nitrogen in such cultures is obscure. They grew in liquid media, distilled water with 1 per cent glucose and ammonia (0.1 per cent (NH4)2HPO4) as the sole source of nitrogen; but only feebly in 1 per cent glucose only. Incorporation of whole killed cultures, extracts or nitrates of cultures improved growth of Azotobacter on solid nitrogen-free media and improved its mucilage production."

https://openalex.org/W1966137292,"APART from the obligatory cannibalism of the genus Toxorhynchites and the sub-genera Mucidus and Lutzia, cannibalism in other mosquito genera has been little studied. Graham1 stated that the addition of 3 per cent common salt to the breeding water brought about cannibalism in A. gambiæ. This was not confirmed by subsequent work. It has, however, been observed in Mauritius that facultative cannibalism exists within the salt-water strain of A. gambiæ. Such a tendency has not been observed in the freshwater strains of A. gambiæ."
https://openalex.org/W2079761973,"DURING studies on the effects of repeated parenteral administration of iron to mice, rabbits and guinea pigs, various toxic manifestations were observed1; but in general there was little effect on growth with either colloidal or diffusible forms of iron. One diffusible iron preparation, namely, ‘ferric hydroxide ferrous ascorbate’, however, depressed growth markedly. The results obtained with three iron preparations are summarized below."
