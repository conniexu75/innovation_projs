https://openalex.org/W2022085591,"A strategy based on reticulating metal ions and organic carboxylate links into extended networks has been advanced to a point that allowed the design of porous structures in which pore size and functionality could be varied systematically. Metal-organic framework (MOF-5), a prototype of a new class of porous materials and one that is constructed from octahedral Zn-O-C clusters and benzene links, was used to demonstrate that its three-dimensional porous system can be functionalized with the organic groups -Br, -NH2, -OC3H7, -OC5H11, -C2H4, and -C4H4 and that its pore size can be expanded with the long molecular struts biphenyl, tetrahydropyrene, pyrene, and terphenyl. We synthesized an isoreticular series (one that has the same framework topology) of 16 highly crystalline materials whose open space represented up to 91.1% of the crystal volume, as well as homogeneous periodic pores that can be incrementally varied from 3.8 to 28.8 angstroms. One member of this series exhibited a high capacity for methane storage (240 cubic centimeters at standard temperature and pressure per gram at 36 atmospheres and ambient temperature), and others the lowest densities (0.41 to 0.21 gram per cubic centimeter) for a crystalline material at room temperature."

We report a specific enrichment of microorganisms of the family Geobacteraceae on energy-harvesting anodes, and we show that these microorganisms can conserve energy to support their growth by oxidizing organic compounds with an electrode serving as the sole electron acceptor. This finding not only provides a method for extracting energy from organic matter, but also suggests a strategy for promoting the bioremediation of organic contaminants in subsurface environments."
https://openalex.org/W1531047539,"Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to image the additional quasi-particle states generated by quantized vortices in the high critical temperature superconductor Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+δ . They exhibit a copper-oxygen bond–oriented “checkerboard” pattern, with four unit cell (4 a 0 ) periodicity and a ∼30 angstrom decay length. These electronic modulations may be related to the magnetic field–induced, 8 a 0 periodic, spin density modulations with decay length of ∼70 angstroms recently discovered in La 1.84 Sr 0.16 CuO 4 . The proposed explanation is a spin density wave localized surrounding each vortex core. General theoretical principles predict that, in the cuprates, a localized spin modulation of wavelength λ should be associated with a corresponding electronic modulation of wavelength λ/2, in good agreement with our observations."

Mutations in two human I KS channel subunits, hKCNQ1 and hKCNE1, prolong APD and cause inherited cardiac arrhythmias known as LQTS (long QT syndrome). We show that βAR modulation of I KS requires targeting of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)–dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to hKCNQ1 through the targeting protein yotiao. Yotiao binds to hKCNQ1 by a leucine zipper motif, which is disrupted by an LQTS mutation (hKCNQ1-G589D). Identification of the hKCNQ1 macromolecular complex provides a mechanism for SNS modulation of cardiac APD through I KS ."
https://openalex.org/W2023137124,"Spider silks are protein-based “biopolymer” filaments or threads secreted by specialized epithelial cells as concentrated soluble precursors of highly repetitive primary sequences. Spider dragline silk is a flexible, lightweight fiber of extraordinary strength and toughness comparable to that of synthetic high-performance fibers. We sought to “biomimic” the process of spider silk production by expressing in mammalian cells the dragline silk genes ( ADF-3 / MaSpII and MaSpI ) of two spider species. We produced soluble recombinant (rc)–dragline silk proteins with molecular masses of 60 to 140 kilodaltons. We demonstrated the wet spinning of silk monofilaments spun from a concentrated aqueous solution of soluble rc–spider silk protein (ADF-3; 60 kilodaltons) under modest shear and coagulation conditions. The spun fibers were water insoluble with a fine diameter (10 to 40 micrometers) and exhibited toughness and modulus values comparable to those of native dragline silks but with lower tenacity. Dope solutions with rc–silk protein concentrations &gt;20% and postspinning draw were necessary to achieve improved mechanical properties of the spun fibers. Fiber properties correlated with finer fiber diameter and increased birefringence."

Here we report that germline mutations in the gene encoding 2'-5'-oligoadenylate(2-5A)-dependent RNase L (RNASEL) segregate in prostate cancer families that show linkage to the HPC1 (hereditary prostate cancer 1) region at 1q24-25 (ref. 9). We identified RNASEL by a positional cloning/candidate gene method, and show that a nonsense mutation and a mutation in an initiation codon of RNASEL segregate independently in two HPC1-linked families. Inactive RNASEL alleles are present at a low frequency in the general population. RNASEL regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis through the interferon-regulated 2-5A pathway and has been suggested to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene. We found that microdissected tumors with a germline mutation showed loss of heterozygosity and loss of RNase L protein, and that RNASEL activity was reduced in lymphoblasts from heterozyogous individuals compared with family members who were homozygous with respect to the wildtype allele. Thus, germline mutations in RNASEL may be of diagnostic value, and the 2-5A pathway might provide opportunities for developing therapies for those with prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2147315723,"Blood vessels express estrogen receptors, but their role in cardiovascular physiology is not well understood. We show that vascular smooth muscle cells and blood vessels from estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta)-deficient mice exhibit multiple functional abnormalities. In wild-type mouse blood vessels, estrogen attenuates vasoconstriction by an ERbeta-mediated increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. In contrast, estrogen augments vasoconstriction in blood vessels from ERbeta-deficient mice. Vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from ERbeta-deficient mice show multiple abnormalities of ion channel function. Furthermore, ERbeta-deficient mice develop sustained systolic and diastolic hypertension as they age. These data support an essential role for ERbeta in the regulation of vascular function and blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2001908075,"The germ line of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans influences life-span; when the germ-line precursor cells are removed, life-span is increased dramatically. We find that neither sperm, nor oocytes, nor meiotic precursor cells are responsible for this effect. Rather life-span is influenced by the proliferating germ-line stem cells. These cells, as well as a downstream transcriptional regulator, act in the adult to influence aging, indicating that the aging process remains plastic during adulthood. We propose that the germ-line stem cells affect life-span by influencing the production of, or the response to, a steroid hormone that promotes longevity."

https://openalex.org/W1979955102,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) mounts a stubborn defense against oxidative and nitrosative components of the immune response. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd) and dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (SucB) are components of alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes that are central to intermediary metabolism. We find that Lpd and SucB support Mtb's antioxidant defense. The peroxiredoxin alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) is linked to Lpd and SucB by an adaptor protein, AhpD. The 2.0 angstrom AhpD crystal structure reveals a thioredoxin-like active site that is responsive to lipoamide. We propose that Lpd, SucB (the only lipoyl protein detected in Mtb), AhpD, and AhpC together constitute a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced)-dependent peroxidase and peroxynitrite reductase. AhpD thus represents a class of thioredoxin-like molecules that enables an antioxidant defense."

https://openalex.org/W2042071773,"The recent discovery of Epac, a novel cAMP receptor protein, opens up a new dimension in studying cAMP-mediated cell signaling. It is conceivable that many of the cAMP functions previously attributed to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are in fact also Epac-dependent. The finding of an additional intracellular cAMP receptor provides an opportunity to further dissect the divergent roles that cAMP exerts in different cell types. In this study, we probed cross-talk between cAMP signaling and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB pathways. Specifically, we examined the modulatory effects of cAMP on PKB activity by monitoring the specific roles that Epac and PKA play individually in regulating PKB activity. Our study suggests a complex regulatory scheme in which Epac and PKA mediate the opposing effects of cAMP on PKB regulation. Activation of Epac leads to a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent PKB activation, while stimulation of PKA inhibits PKB activity. Furthermore, activation of PKB by Epac requires the proper subcellular targeting of Epac. The opposing effects of Epac and PKA on PKB activation provide a potential mechanism for the cell type-specific differential effects of cAMP.

It is proposed that the net outcome of cAMP signaling is dependent upon the dynamic abundance and distribution of intracellular Epac and PKA. Cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) is produced as an intracellular second messenger in response to a variety of extracellular signals, including hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters. cAMP regulates a wide range of important biological processes, which, alongside cell metabolism, include cell division, growth, differentiation, secretion, memory, and neoplastic transformation. For many years, major intracellular effects of cAMP in mammalian cells were believed to be mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). 1The abbreviations used are: PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseCcAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunitRcAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunitEpacexchange protein directly activated by cAMPGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasedibutyryl cAMPN6, O2′-dibutyryl adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphatePBSphosphate-buffered salinePDKphosphoinositide-dependent kinaseHEKhuman embryonic kidneyEGFPepidermal growth factor proteinWRTWistar rat thyroidTSHthyrotropin 1The abbreviations used are: PKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseCcAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunitRcAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunitEpacexchange protein directly activated by cAMPGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasedibutyryl cAMPN6, O2′-dibutyryl adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphatePBSphosphate-buffered salinePDKphosphoinositide-dependent kinaseHEKhuman embryonic kidneyEGFPepidermal growth factor proteinWRTWistar rat thyroidTSHthyrotropin The regulation of PKA is achieved via a unique three-component signaling system in which PKA is composed of two separate subunits, the catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) subunits that interact to form an inactive holoenzyme complex (1.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of Thr197 in the activation loop of the C subunit is necessary for the maturation and optimal catalytic activity of PKA (2.Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shunton H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Cheng X. Ma Y. Moore M. Hemmings B.A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9849-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), unlike most other kinases whose activity is regulated by dynamic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the activation loop this phosphorylation step does not seem to be a regulatory mechanism for PKA in vivo. Once phosphorylated, PKA is fully active in its catalytic potential and the Thr197 phosphate does not turn over readily (4.Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The activation of PKA is achieved by binding of the second messenger cAMP to the R subunit, which consequently induces a conformational change in the R subunit and leads to the dissociation of the holoenzyme into its constituent subunits (1.Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The free active C subunit can then affect a range of diverse cellular events by phosphorylating an array of cytoplasmic and nuclear protein substrates, including enzymes and transcription factors (5.Zetterqvist Ö.

Lawrance Jr., J.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 7: 43-50Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For example, in PC12 cells, Swiss 3T3 cells, and thyrocytes, cAMP activates MAP kinases, potentiates the effects of growth factors on differentiation and gene expression, and/or stimulates cell growth and promotes the G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle (7.Frodin M.

In contrast, cAMP inhibits the proliferation of many cells, including fibroblasts (Rat1 and NIH 3T3), smooth muscle cells, and cells transformed by oncogenes such as ras (11.Burgering B.M.T.

Despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanism underlying the cell type-specific effects of cAMP remains elusive. The growth inhibitory effect of cAMP is believed to be mediated partly through activation of PKA, which interferes with Ras/MAPK signaling pathways (15.Qiu W. Zhuang S. von Lintig F.C. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 31921-31929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggested that PI3K activity may be required for cAMP-stimulated cell proliferation in thyroid cells (16.Cass L.A. Summers S.A. Prendergast G.V. Backer J.M. Birnbaum M.J. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5882-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17.Ciullo I. Diez-Roux G. Di Domenico M. Migliaccio A. Avvedimento E.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1186-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effects of cAMP on PI3K/PKB pathways are also cell type-specific and correlate well with the mitogenic effects of cAMP (16.Cass L.A. Summers S.A. Prendergast G.V. Backer J.M. Birnbaum M.J. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5882-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In cells in which cAMP is mitogenic, cAMP stimulates PKB phosphorylation and membrane ruffling. Furthermore, cAMP effects on PKB and membrane ruffling are PKA independent (16.Cass L.A. Summers S.A. Prendergast G.V. Backer J.M. Birnbaum M.J. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5882-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that multiple cAMP-mediated pathways exist and only some are PKA dependent. Therefore, the recently discovered cAMP receptor Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) or cAMP-GEF (cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor) may represent an important piece of the puzzle that is critical to our understanding of cAMP-mediated cell signaling. Epac contains a cAMP-binding domain that is homologous to the R subunit of PKA and a guanine exchange factor (GEF) domain (18.de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 19.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Epac proteins bind cAMP with high affinity and activate their downstream target Rap1, a Ras superfamily guanine nucleotide-binding protein. Rap1, initially identified as an antagonist for the transforming function of Ras (20.Kitayama H. Suigimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) and on the basis of its high homology to Ras (21.Prizon V. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1998; 3: 201-204Google Scholar), is activated in response to an increase in intracellular cAMP in additional to many other stimuli (22.Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.Sn. Ostrowski M.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10373-10376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23.Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.

Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Although PKA can phosphorylate Rap1 at its C terminus (25.Quilliam L.A. Mueller H. Bohl B.P. Prossnitz V. Sklar L.A. Der C.L. Bokoch G.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1628-1635PubMed Google Scholar), the Rap1S180A mutant that lacks the PKA phosphorylation site can be activated by Epac in response to cAMP (18.de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of the PKA phosphorylation site in Drosophila Rap1 does not impair its biological functions (26.Asha H. deRuiter N.D. Wang M.-G. Hariharan I.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These observations suggest cAMP-mediated activation of Rap1 may be independent of phosphorylation by PKA. It is most likely that the cAMP-mediated signaling mechanism is much more complex than was believed earlier, and many cAMP-mediated effects that were previously thought to act through PKA are in fact also transduced by Epac. Therefore, it is imperative to reformulate concepts of cAMP-mediated signaling to include the contribution of Epac. The existence of Epac immediately raises many questions regarding the mechanism of cAMP-mediated signaling. Since both PKA and Epac are broadly expressed in many tissues (18.de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 19.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar), an increase in intracellular cAMP levels will lead to the activation of both enzymes, and possibly other potential cAMP target(s) as well. It is conceivable that while PKA acts through a discrete set of signaling pathways, Epac may enlist distinct signaling pathways, and the net cellular effects of cAMP are dictated by the sum of these events. Therefore, the apparent cellular effect of cAMP can vary depending upon the relative cellular abundance and distribution of Epac and PKA. Our hypothesis is that there is a dynamic control of cellular expression and targeting of Epac and PKA which, coupled with the dynamic changes in the concentration of cAMP, are the controlling mechanisms that determine the observed cell type-specific cAMP effects. To test this hypothesis, we examined the specific effects of Epac and PKA on the PI3K/PKB pathway that has been reported to exhibit cell type-specific responses to cAMP. Our study shows for the first time that although Epac and PKA are activated by a common upstream second messenger cAMP, they can exert opposing effects in regulating downstream targets such as PKB. Therefore, the net outcome of cAMP signaling on PKB activation may be dependent upon the dynamic abundance and distribution of intracellular Epac and PKA. Human epaccDNA was a generous gift from Dr. J. L. Bos (University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands). C-terminal FLAG-tagged epac was constructed by PCR using a 5′ primer, 5′-ccatatgctagcATGGTGTTGAGAAGGATGCAC-3′ and a 3′ primer, 5′-ttcggaattcTTATTTGTCGTCGTCTTTGTAGTCTGGCTCCAGCTCTCGGGAGA-3′. The amplified cDNA fragment was subcloned into the NheI-EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). C-terminal, gfp-tagged epac (Epac-EGFP) was constructed by PCR using a 5′ primer 5′-ccatatgctaGCATGGTGTTGAGAAGGATGCAC-3′ and a 3′ primer 5′-tcatatagagctcCTGGCTCCAGCTCTCGGGAGAG-3′. The amplified cDNA fragment was subcloned into the NheI-SacI sites of eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH Laboratories), in which the epac gene was fused in-frame and upstream from the gfp gene. By the same method, we constructed the Δ(1–148) epac deletion mutant and Δ(1–148) epac-egfp that lack the first 148 N-terminal Epac amino acid residues. All DNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Monoclonal Rap1 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies that specifically recognize PKB and phosphorylated PKB were from Cell Signaling. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were from Bio-Rad. The SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate Reagents kit was obtained from Pierce. Culture media were from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was from Sigma. Forskolin and N6, O2′-dibutyryl adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (dibutyryl cAMP) were fromCalbiochem. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were from American Type Culture Collection. All chemicals were reagent grade. Specific polyclonal antibodies against Epac were generated by Alpha Diagnostic International Inc. (San Antonio, TX) using synthetic Epac peptide spanning residues 41–60, (C)DFSESLEQASTERVLRAGR. The immune sera were initially purified using an ImmunoPure IgG Purification Kit (Pierce) and further affinity purified by immobilized Epac peptide using the SulfoLink Antibody Purification Kit (Pierce). Antibody elution fractions were dialyzed in PBS. Specificity of purified antibody was confirmed by Western blot using recombinant Epac protein expressed in insect Sf9 cells. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified chamber supplemented with 5% CO2. The day before the transfection, cells were subcultured into 6-well tissue culture plates, grown to 60–80% confluence overnight, and transfected with purified plasmid DNA at 1 μg/well using LipofectAMINE PlusTM Reagent (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected using G418 at 0.15 mg/ml. Wistar Rat thyroid cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in 3H medium (Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium containing 1 milliunits/ml of crude bovine TSH, 10 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5% calf serum). Cells grown in 6-well plates at 70–90% confluence were serum starved for 20 h before the activation experiments. Cells were treated with forskolin (10 μm), dibutyryl cAMP (1 mm) for various time. Activation was terminated by washing cells twice with PBS. For experiments involving kinase inhibitors, cells were treated with H89 (5 μm), LY294002 (10 μm), or wortmannin (100 nm) 20 min prior to stimulation. Cell lysates were prepared by directly suspending the cells into Laemmli SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The GTP loading status of Rap1 was assessed using a glutathione S-transferase fusion of the Rap1-binding domain of RalGDS as described earlier (27.de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to 75% confluence in 100-mm Corning culture dish, starved in serum-free medium for 48 h, and treated with 10 μm forskolin for 5 min. Following three washes in PBS, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitors. The cell lysate was mixed with 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads with 30 μg of glutathione S-transferase-RalGDS-Rap1-binding domain bound and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation. Following three washes in lysis buffer, the beads were suspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. 15 μl of protein samples were loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and further analyzed with Western blot using Rap1 specific antibodies. Protein concentration of cell lysates was assayed with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and 30 μg of protein was denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min prior to resolution by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a Trans-Blot SD transfer cell (Bio-Rad) and a transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 0.0375% SDS (pH 8.3). Membranes were placed in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer (TTBS) at 4 °C overnight to block nonspecific binding sites, followed by incubation with various antibodies for 1 h at room temperature: anti-PKB antibodies (1:1000), anti-phosphate T308 PKB antibodies (1:1000), anti-phosphate S473 PKB antibodies (1:1000), and affinity purified anti-Epac polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml). Membranes were then washed with TTBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following three 10-min washes in TTBS, membranes were treated with substrates for 5 min and exposed to x-ray film at room temperature. At least three independent experiments were performed for each Western blot. PKB activity was measured using an Akt Kinase Assay kit from Cell Signaling following manufacturer's protocol. Mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). All DNA constructs were sequenced to confirm the mutation as well as to verify the accuracy of the full-length cDNA sequence. To detect the subcellular localization of Epac-EGFP and Δ(1–148)Epac-EGFP, cells were subcultured after transfection with an appropriate plasmid in 6-well plates with a poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip in each well and grown for 16–24 h. Then the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The samples were rinsed with PBS, mounted on glass slides, and sealed in 70% glycerol. Fluorescent signals were revealed under the fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51), using an fluorescein isothiocyanate/GFP filter with maximum excitation at 488 nm and maximum emission at 525 nm. Fluorescence images were recorded using a Hamamatsu digital camera (C4742-95). To elucidate the specific roles of Epac and PKA in modulating the PKB signaling pathway, we examined the effects of cAMP-elevating agents on activation of PKB in parental HEK293 and HEK293 cells that have been stably transfected with Epac. As shown in Fig. 1A, HEK293 cells expressed normal levels of PKA but undetectable amounts of Epac when cell lysates from HEK293 and HEK293/Epac cells were probed by affinity purified PKA catalytic subunit antibodies and affinity purified Epac antibodies, respectively. A protein with the apparent molecular weight of 100,000 corresponding to the calculated size of Epac was readily detectable in the Epac-transfected HEK293 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of Epac in HEK293 cells did not affect the protein levels of PKA (Fig. 1A). When treated with forskolin, endogenous PKB activity in HEK293/Epac cells was increased about 3-fold (Fig. 1B), as monitored by phosphorylation of Ser473 and Thr308, whose phosphorylation status is critical for the kinase activity of PKB (28.Alessi D.R.

This observation was in marked contrast to that of the parental non-transfected HEK293 cells where forskolin caused an apparent inhibition in phosphorylation of the endogenous PKB at both Ser473 and Thr308(Fig. 1C). Inhibition of PKB phosphorylation by cAMP was blocked following treatment with a specific PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of cAMP on PKB is likely mediated by PKA. Moreover, H89 also augmented the cAMP-mediated PKB activation in HEK293/Epac cells (Fig. 1B), confirming the inhibitory effect of PKA on PKB activation. The basal levels of PKB activation was slightly elevated (∼30%) in 293/Epac cells as compared with that of the parental 293 cells when the PKB phosphorylation levels of 293 and 293/Epac cells were monitored on the same blot (Fig. 1D). In addition to monitoring the phosphorylation status of PKB Ser473 and Thr308, we also measured the endogenous cellular PKB kinase activity directly. Results from these kinase activity experiments confirmed the Western blotting data (Table I). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that Epac and PKA regulate the PKB signaling cascade in opposite directions. To monitor the temporal relationship between the roles of Epac and PKA on modulating PKB activation, we examined the effects of forskolin on PKB phosphorylation in 293 and 293/Epac cells as a function of time. As shown in Fig. 1E, PKB activation by the Epac/Rap1 pathway in the 293/Epac cells was fast and sustained: reaching maximal within 5 min while the inhibitory effect of PKA on PKB peaked around 20 min and slowly attenuated after 30 min.Table IEndogenous PKB activity in HEK293 and HEK293/Epac cells−Forskolin+Forskolin+Forskolin + H89HEK2931.0aThe basal PKB activity in the absence of forskolin treatment was set to 1.0 and PKB activities in the presence of treatments were normalized to the basal PKB level.0.3 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.3HEK293/Epac1.0aThe basal PKB activity in the absence of forskolin treatment was set to 1.0 and PKB activities in the presence of treatments were normalized to the basal PKB level.bThe basal PKB activity in HEK293/Epac cells is about 40% higher than that in HEK293 cells.3.4 ± 0.95.9 ± 1.0Endogenous PKB activities in HEK293 and HEK293/Epac with and without forskolin treatments were measured using Akt Kinase Assay kit from Cell Signaling following the manufacturer's protocol.a The basal PKB activity in the absence of forskolin treatment was set to 1.0 and PKB activities in the presence of treatments were normalized to the basal PKB level.b The basal PKB activity in HEK293/Epac cells is about 40% higher than that in HEK293 cells. Open table in a new tab Endogenous PKB activities in HEK293 and HEK293/Epac with and without forskolin treatments were measured using Akt Kinase Assay kit from Cell Signaling following the manufacturer's protocol. We used dibutyryl cAMP, a classical cell membrane-permeable cAMP analog (30.Posternak T. Weimmann G. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as a direct activating agent for Epac and PKA to verify the effect of forskolin in our study. As shown in Fig. 2, dibutyryl cAMP inhibited the PKB activation in parental 293 cells while promoted the activation of PKB in 293/Epac cells in a manner similar to that of forskolin. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that elevation of cAMP lead to suppression or activation of PKB in 293 cells and 293/Epac cells, respectively. To unambiguously demonstrate that the apparent PKB activation observed in Epac-expressing HEK293 cells in the presence of cAMP-elevating agents is indeed the result of direct activation of Epac by cAMP, a single point mutation of a critical residue, Arg279, in the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of Epac was created. This Arg residue is conserved in all known cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins (31.Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Bubis J. Neitzel J.J. Saraswat L.D. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9668-9673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and interacts directly with the phosphate of cAMP (33.Su Y. Dostmann R.G.

Mutation at this Arg residue leads to the loss of cyclic nucleotide binding activity and biological activity of Epac (19.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Unlike HEK293 cells expressing the wild-type Epac, EpacR279E-expressing HEK293 cells behaved in a manner similar to the parental HEK293 cells in response to forskolin stimulation, resulting in inhibition of PKB activity (Fig. 3). This led us to conclude that the observed cAMP-mediated PKB activation was the direct consequence of Epac activation and required a functional cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. Rap1 is the only known downstream effector for Epac described so far. To test if Rap1 activation contributes to Epac-mediated PKB activation, we compared the levels of GTP-bound Rap1 in serum-starved and forskolin-treated HEK293/Epac and parental HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the amount of GTP-bound Rap1 in parental HEK293 cells was below the detection limit of the pull-down assay and forskolin did not significantly increase the GTP loading of Rap1 in these cells. This fits very well with our observation that the expression of Epac in HEK293 cells is very low, under the detection limit of Western blot using affinity purified Epac antibodies. In contrast, Epac-expressing HEK293 cells exhibited basally elevated levels of GTP-bound Rap1 compared with parental HEK293 cells. This observation is consistent with the original report that Epac overexpression is sufficient to partially activate Rap1 even in the absence of cAMP-elevating agent and Epac is capable of further activating Rap1 specifically in response to cAMP (18.de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 19.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N.

Treatment with forskolin further increased the proportion of GTP-bound Rap1 in HEK293/Epac cells. These results suggest that Rap1 activation is potentially involved in Epac-mediated PKB activation.

Weeks after stress, electrophysiological measurements in hippocampus slices displayed apparently normal evoked synaptic responses but extreme hypersensitivity to both anticholinesterases and atropine.

In the present studies, we found that stimulation of CD95 receptors, with either agonistic antibody or CD95 ligand, resulted in the activation of caspase-8, which in turn processed caspase-3 between its large and small subunits. However, in contrast to control cells, those overexpressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL displayed a distinctive pattern of caspase-3 processing. Indeed, the resulting p20/p12 caspase-3 was not active and did not undergo normal autocatalytic processing to form p17/p12 caspase-3, because it was bound to and inhibited by endogenous X-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (XIAP). Importantly, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibited the release of both cytochrome c and Smac from mitochondria. However, since Smac alone was sufficient to promote caspase-3 activity in vitro by inactivating XIAP, we proposed the existence of a death receptor-induced, Smac-dependent and apoptosome-independent pathway. This type II pathway was subsequently reconstituted in vitro using purified recombinant proteins at endogenous concentrations. Thus, mitochondria and associated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins may play a functional role in death receptor-induced apoptosis by modulating the release of Smac. Our data strongly suggest that the relative ratios of XIAP (and other inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins) to active caspase-3 and Smac may dictate, in part, whether a cell exhibits a type I or type II phenotype.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, can be induced through two basic and distinct cell death signaling pathways, both of which culminate in the activation of cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases or caspases.

All caspases are synthesized as single chain zymogens, possessing a prodomain, a large (∼20 kDa) subunit, and a small (∼10 kDa) subunit. Caspases-8 and -9 are referred to as apical caspases, because they contain long prodomains that allow them to interact with their respective adapter proteins and undergo proximity-induced, autocatalytic activation. In this model, one caspase-8 or caspase-9 molecule within the DISC or apoptosome, respectively, activates another by cleaving between its large and small subunits. The activated apical caspases then propagate the death signal by activating short prodomain effector caspases-3 and/or -7, which proteolytically dismantle the cell (10.Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M.

Thus, in death receptor-induced apoptosis, protection by Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL is an indicator of the requirement for mitochondrial involvement, and for the sake of convenience, those cells that are protected by Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL have been termed type II cells, whereas those that are not protected are termed type I cells (38.Scaffidi C.

Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K. Fontana A. Villunger A. Newton K. Tschopp J. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide an explanation for some of the conflicting results previously observed and, in doing so, help to redefine or update the type I/type II cell model. We show that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, in addition to inhibiting the release of cytochrome c, also block release of Smac from mitochondria and thus can modulate a second, unique type II signaling pathway. Indeed, XIAP can prevent death receptor-induced apoptosis solely through its inhibition of active caspase-3. Therefore, by inhibiting the release of Smac, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can prevent the inactivation of XIAP and inhibit cell death. Jurkat T-cells (J6) and T-lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cells, stably transfected with either empty vector, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL (41.Belka C. Rudner J. Wesselborg S. Stepczynska A. Marini P.

Cells were treated for 4 h with the agonistic anti-CD95 antibody, CH-11 (10–50 ng/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or recombinant CD95 ligand (50 ng/ml), cross-linked with M2 anti-FLAG antibody, according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Alexis Biochemicals, Nottingham, UK). After treatment, the percentage of annexin V-positive cells (% apoptosis) was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, as described previously (43.Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J.

Annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate was purchased from Bender Medsystems (Vienna, Austria). After treatment, cells were pelleted and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Some of the cells were then mixed with Laemmli loading buffer and briefly sonicated. The whole cell protein samples were subsequently resolved by 12–15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for caspase-8, caspase-3, cleaved caspase-6 (recognizes only the processed p18 large subunit; Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The remaining cells were incubated with buffer containing 0.25% digitonin on ice for 20 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 10 min, and the cytosolic fractions (supernatants) were collected. These fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for cytochrome c (BD PharMingen) and Smac. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies to caspase-8 (large subunit) (43.Sun X.M. MacFarlane M.

Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were generated in our laboratory. Lysates prepared from control and CD95-treated Jurkat cells were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, and precoated with anti-caspase-3 antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The resulting protein complexes were obtained by centrifugation, washed 4 times in buffer (100 mm HEPES, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, pH 7.0), and immunoblotted for XIAP (Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ), cIAP-1, or cIAP-2 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). For the XIAP blots, a secondary antibody specific for mouse IgGκ chains was also utilized, to better distinguish the XIAP band from the heavy chain of the anti-XIAP antibody. Wild-type processed caspase-8 (pET-21b), procaspase-3 (pET-21b), and mature Smac (residues 56–239; pET-15b) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21(DE3) and purified on Ni2+-Sepharose beads, as described previously (26.Bratton S.B. Walker G. Srinivasula S. Sun X.-M. Butterworth M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 998-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase-tagged XIAP was expressed and purified on GSH-Sepharose beads, as described previously (19.Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant caspase-8 (p18/p12 form; 5–120 nm), procaspase-3 (200 nm), XIAP (1–40 nm), and Smac (5–100 nm) were incubated in various combinations at 37 °C for 1 h in caspase assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, pH 7.0), and caspase-3 was subsequently immunoblotted, as described above. DEVDase activities were determined using the substrate, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin, as described previously (8.Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). As already noted, during death receptor-induced apoptosis, caspase-8 processes caspase-3 between its large and small subunits. However, recent studies (37.Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 45.Rokhlin O.W. Guseva N. Tagiyev A. Knudson C.M. Cohen M.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2836-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) indicate that the prodomain of caspase-3 is not subsequently removed in cells overexpressing Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or the viral protein E1B 19K. Because these cells were also resistant to cell death, we found this observation intriguing and thus began to search for a causal relationship. Perez and White (37.Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) suggested that maturation of caspase-3 from its p20/p12 to p17/p12 form was required for its catalytic activity and that this second cleavage step was carried out by the Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosome. However, this explanation seemed unlikely to us, given that removal of the prodomain from caspase-3 is normally associated with its autocatalytic activity (46.Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C.

Therefore, we initiated studies in which Jurkat T-cells, stably expressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, were treated with an agonistic CD95 antibody (CH-11). As expected, in vector control-treated cells, CD95 stimulation led to increased apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Both procaspase-8 splice forms were processed to their p43 and p41 forms (prodomain + large subunit), respectively (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), and at the higher concentration of CH-11, some p18 fragment (large subunit only) was also observed (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Caspase-3 was processed primarily to its p19 form or its fully mature p17 form (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3), and the caspase-3 substrates, caspase-6 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), were significantly processed (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3; Fig. 2A, lane 2). In addition, there was a dramatic increase in caspase-3-like DEVDase activity (data not shown).Figure 2Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL promote XIAP-caspase-3 interactions and inhibit DEVDase activity by preventing release of the IAP antagonist, Smac/DIABLO, from mitochondria. Vector control (VC), Bcl-2-, and Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells were treated with CH-11 antibody (50 ng/ml) for 4 h. Cytosolic lysates from control and treated cells were then prepared and assayed for processing of PARP (A), basal levels of XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2 (B), and release of cytochrome c (Cyt. c) and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria (C). D, total caspase-3 (Casp-3) was immunoprecipitated (IP) from each lysate, and the pellets were subsequently Western blotted (WB), for XIAP and caspase-3. For clarity, XIAP blots were also incubated with a mouse anti-IgG k secondary (2°) antibody, because it was difficult to separate the heavy chain (HC) of the mouse polyclonal antibody from XIAP. LC, light chain. E, lysates from untreated vector control (Con) and CD95-stimulated Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells were also incubated (0–60 min) with exogenous Smac (500 nm) at 37 °C and subsequently assayed for DEVDase activity, as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In cells overexpressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, cell death was markedly reduced (Fig. 1A). Caspase-8 was processed normally to its p43 and p41 forms, although to a lesser extent than in control cells, and no p18 fragment was observed (Fig. 1A, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9). Caspase-8 was active, as it processed caspase-3 between its large and small subunits, but interestingly, almost all of the processed caspase-3 was present in its p20 form (Fig. 1A, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9). Cleavage of caspase-6 and PARP, as well as DEVDase activity, was significantly reduced in cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, indicating that caspase-3 activity was reduced (Fig. 1A, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9; Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4; data not shown). Furthermore, this lack of caspase-3 activity and, consequently, activation of caspase-6 probably explained the observed decrease in caspase-8 processing compared with control cells (Fig. 1A), because caspase-6 is known to process additional procaspase-8 (48.Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to previous reports (38.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar, 39.Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol.

Although the Jurkat T-cells in the present study clearly underwent death receptor-mediated apoptosis following CD95 ligation with CH-11 antibodies, and did so in a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-inhibitable manner, there has been considerable debate in the literature as to the existence of type II cells, and particularly the use of anti-CD95 antibodies to induce apoptosis (40.Huang D.C. Hahne M. Schroeter M. Frei K. Fontana A. Villunger A. Newton K. Tschopp J. Strasser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14871-14876Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 49.Huang D.C.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 821-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, to verify that Bcl-2 could influence CD95-mediated processing of caspase-3 and cell death in another cell line, we treated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cells with either CH-11 antibodies or cross-linked CD95L (50 ng/ml). Remarkably, both treatments induced almost identical levels of apoptosis, and the processing of caspases-8, -3, and -6, in the CH-11 and CD95L-treated cells was virtually indistinguishable (Fig. 1B, lanes 11 and 12). More importantly, however, in Bcl-2 stably transfected CEM cells, cell death was inhibited by ∼50–60% in both treatments, and processing of caspase-8 was significantly reduced (Fig. 1B, lanes 13 and 14). As before, caspase-3 was processed primarily to its p20 form, and there was no autoprocessing of caspase-3 to its fully mature p17 form (Fig. 1B, lanes 13 and 14). Furthermore, the p20 form of caspase-3 was inhibited, as no processing of caspase-6 could be observed (Fig. 1B, lanes l3 and 14). Thus, the inhibition of caspase-3 processing in Bcl-2-transfected cells was not limited to Jurkat T-cells, and the phenomenon could be observed with either anti-CD95 antibody or CD95L. The inability of p20/p12 caspase-3 to remove its prodomain suggested to us that the enzyme might be inhibited. Therefore, because IAPs, including XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2, are known to inhibit caspase-3 activity with inhibitory constants (Ki) of ∼0.7, ∼108, and ∼35 nm, respectively (13.Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 15.Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), we initially investigated whether Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL might influence their expression. The levels of XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2, however, were not elevated in Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL-transfected cells compared with vector control cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3). Therefore, we next examined if these IAPs might be directly associated with caspase-3 in cells. No interaction between caspase-3 and cIAP-1 or cIAP-2 could be detected (data not shown). However, immunoprecipitation of total caspase-3 from unstimulated and stimulated cells indicated that XIAP was almost exclusively associated with processed caspase-3 (Fig. 2D, compare lane 2 with lanes 3–5). Strikingly, far more XIAP was associated with the partially processed p20 subunit of caspase-3, in cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, than with the p17 subunit in vector control cells, even though significantly more of the p17 subunit was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2D, compare lane 3 with lanes 4 and 5). Because XIAP can bind and inhibit both p17/p12 caspase-3 and p20/p12 caspase-3 in vitro (22.Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), these data suggested that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL specifically inhibited the release of some factor from mitochondria that could bind to XIAP and prevent its interaction with processed caspase-3. Smac/DIABLO contains an N-terminal “AVPI” motif, which allows it to bind the BIR3 domain in XIAP and displace caspase-9, as well as a second region that is sufficient to displace processed caspases-3 and -7 from the BIR2 domain in XIAP (29.Wu G.

After repair synthesis and hOGG1 repair (Fig. 1, reaction 4), normal base pairs can be restored. Recently, we have demonstrated that hMYH is the major protein in human cell extracts that recognizes A/8-oxoG-containing DNA substrates (21.Gu Y. Lu A-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, together with hOGG1 and hMTH1, hMYH is the primary repair protein responsible for protecting the cell from the mutagenic effects of 8-oxoG. If 8-oxo-dGTP is not hydrolyzed by hMTH1 protein, it can be incorporated to pair with template adenine. In this case, if hMYH excises the adenine on the template strand (Fig. 1, reaction 5), a higher A:T to C:G transversion will occur. Thus, directing hMYH to the daughter but not the parental strand is crucial for the fidelity of DNA replication involving GO adducts. It has been suggested that hMYH repair is coupled to DNA replication through docking with human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication protein A (RPA) (22.Boldogh I. Milligan D. Lee M.S. Bassett H. Lloyd R.S. McCullough A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2802-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol.

Mismatch repair enzymes are also involved in cell cycle arrest, transcription-coupled repair, and meiotic recombination (for reviews, see Refs. 24.Kolodner R.

E. colimismatch repair is dependent on dam methylation and requires specifically the MutH, MutL, and MutS proteins. The MutH endonuclease cleaves at the 5′-end of unmethylated GATC sequences. A homodimer of MutS recognizes base/base mismatches and short insertion-deletion loops. MutL enhances the activities of MutH, MutS, and DNA helicase II (29.Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol.

The eukaryotic mismatch repair system contains multiple MutS and MutL homologs; however, no MutH homolog has been identified. The hMSH2/hMSH6 (hMutSα) heterodimer recognizes base/base mismatches and short insertion-deletion loops, whereas the hMSH2/hMSH3 (hMutSβ) recognizes longer insertion-deletion loops (32.Drummond J.T.

It has been suggested that strand breaks on the daughter DNA strands or a direct interaction between repair components and the replication machinery may provide discrimination between daughter and parental strands. Germ line mutations in human mismatch repair genes can lead to gene mutations and increase microsatellite instability, and they have been correlated with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and various sporadic cancers (25.Kolodner R.D. Alani E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27.Lu A-L. Hoelm H. Nicolaides N.C. DNA Repair in Higher Eukaryotes.

It has been demonstrated that mismatch repair-deficient cells are resistant to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents including alkylation agents, cisplatin, and 6-thioguanine (28.Modrich P. Lahue R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). The mismatch repair system has also been shown to be involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Cells defective in the MSH2 gene are impaired in transcription-coupled repair of oxidative damage (35.Leadon S.A. Avrutskaya A.V. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3784-3791PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a defective Msh2 allele accumulate oxidized bases in their DNA (36.DeWeese T.L. Shipman J.M. Larrier N.A. Buckley N.M. Kidd L.R. Groopman J.D. Cutler R.G. te Riele H. Nelson W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11915-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recently, Msh2p/Msh6p of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to bind A/GO mismatches and to be involved in repair of GO lesions in DNA (Fig. 1, reactions 3 and 6) (37.Ni T.T. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 439-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Because S. cerevisiaedoes not contain MutY and MutT homologs, it is unclear whether the role of MSH2/MSH6 in GO repair is also important in other organisms. We have previously shown that hMYH is directly associated with human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, human PCNA, and human RPA, suggesting that hMYH plays a role in the long patch base excision repair pathway (23.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that hMYH also interacts with the hMSH2/hMSH6 (hMutSα) heterodimer but not with hMSH2/hMSH3 (hMutSβ). More specifically, hMYH was found to interact physically with hMSH6 but not with hMSH2. Additionally, the hMSH2/hMSH6 heterodimer stimulates the DNA binding and glycosylase activities of hMYH with an A/GO mismatch. Interestingly, both hMYH and hMSH6 interact with PCNA and colocalize with PCNA to replication foci (22.Boldogh I. Milligan D. Lee M.S. Bassett H. Lloyd R.S. McCullough A.K.

The interactions of PCNA with both hMYH and hMutSα suggest that PCNA may act as a coordinator of both repair pathways. Thus, the MYH-mediated base excision repair may cooperate with mismatch repair in defending against the mutagenic effects of 8-oxoG lesions. TK6 and MT1 cells were kindly supplied by Guo-Min Li. LoVo and HCT15 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). TK6, MT1, and HCT15 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. LoVo cells were grown in Ham's F-12K medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum with 1.5 g/liter NaHCO3, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were grown to late log phase. The cell pellet from three T-75 flasks (∼3 × 107 cells) was resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. An equal volume of 0.1-mm glass beads was added into the cell suspension, and cells were disrupted by vigorous vortexing for 10 s at 4 °C and cooled on ice for 20 s. Vortexing was repeated 10 times. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 15 min. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Recombinant hMYH protein expressed in E. coliwas partially purified according to the procedures described by Gu and Lu (21.Gu Y. Lu A-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The percentage of hMYH in the preparation is about 10% as judged by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of hMYH in the preparation was estimated to be 10% of the total protein concentration. Two sources of hMutSα were tested in the experiments. The untagged hMutSα and hMutSβ kindly provided by Dr. Josef Jiricny were purified according to Palombo et al. (41.Palombo F. Gallinari P. Iaccarino I. Lettieri T. Hughes M. D'Arrigo A. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Jiricny J. Science. 1995; 268: 1912-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The insect Sf9 cells were coinfected with baculovirus vectors carrying cDNA encoding hMSH2 and hMSH6 to express hMutSα and with baculovirus vectors carrying cDNA encoding hMSH2 and hMSH3 to express hMutSβ. Untagged hMSH2 complexed with His-tagged hMSH6 was purified according to the described procedures (42.Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol.

In this system, the cDNAs for hMSH2/hMSH6 were cloned into viral expression vector pFastBacDual (Invitrogen) (a kind gift from Dr. Richard Fishel) to express hMutSα. The hMYH gene and three deletion constructs cloned into the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to express fusion proteins of glutathione S-transferase and hMYH (GST-hMYH) were described previously (23.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Four additional N-terminal deletion constructs of hMYH fused to glutathione S-transferase were made by the PCR method using the sense primers listed in Table I and the antisense primer (5′-TATTCTCGAGTTCACTGGGCTGCACTGT-3′). The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the BamHI-XhoI-digested pGEX-4T-2 vector. The sequences of the cloned hMYH gene fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IPCR primers used to construct GST-hMYH fusion proteinsGST-hMYH constructsResiduesSense primers used(4) Δ183aThe numbers in parentheses represent the construct numbers as in Fig. 4.184–5355′-TATTAGGATCCATGGGGGGCCACATGCCA-3′(5) Δ231232–5355′-TATTAGGATCCATGGTCCGAGCCATTGGT-3′(6) Δ254255–5355′-TATTAGGATCCATGCTGGTGGACCCAGCC-3′(8) Δ352353–5355′-TATTAGGATCCATGCCCAGGGAGGAGAGC-3′a The numbers in parentheses represent the construct numbers as in Fig. 4. Open table in a new tab E. coli (BL21-CodonPlus-RIL/DE3) cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) harboring the expression plasmids of the GST-hMYH constructs were grown in LB broth containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin at 25 °C. Protein expression was induced at an A590 of 0.6 by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cells were harvested 16 h later by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The cell paste, from a 500-ml culture, was resuspended in 9 ml of buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) and treated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. After adding 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 mm dithiothreitol, the solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. To the supernatant (10 ml), 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B in buffer G was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The GST-hMYH fusion proteins bound to the beads were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min and incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin in buffer G overnight at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min and washed four times with 5 ml of buffer G. The beads were suspended in buffer G containing chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), 0.1% sodium azide, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) to form a 50% slurry and stored at 4 °C. Heterodimers hMSH2/hMSH6 (hMutSα) and hMSH2/hMSH3 (hMutSβ) (200 ng) expressed in the baculovirus expression system in insect Sf9 cells were added to the appropriate GST-hMYH constructs (300 ng) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (see above) and incubated overnight in 50 μl of buffer G at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 1000 ×g, the supernatant was saved, and the pellets were washed five times with 800 μl of buffer G at 4 °C. The pellets and supernatants (30 μl) were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot analyses for hMSH2 and hMSH6 were performed as described (44.Towbin H.T. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) (see below). A control was run concurrently with immobilized GST alone. For co-precipitation of hMSH2 and hMSH6 with GST-hMYH from human cell extracts, 200–300 ng of GST-hMYH or GST alone was added to extracts (1.0 mg) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 1000 × g, the supernatant (∼3% of total volume), and the pellet was treated as described above. Proteins in SDS loading buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) were fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS (45.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were allowed to react with antibodies against an hMYH peptide, hMSH2 (Ab-2;Calbiochem), hMSH3 (sc-5686; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), hMSH6 (sc-1242; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and actin (sc-1616; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The α516 hMYH peptide antibodies against residues 516–535 (CDNFFRSHISTDAHSLNSAA) of hMYH were raised in rabbits and purified by peptide affinity chromatography as described (23.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Western blotting was detected by the ECL analysis system from Amersham Biosciences according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant hMSH2/hMSH6 (hMutSα) (7 pmol) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% low fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and then incubated with 3 μg/ml partially purified recombinant hMYH (21.Gu Y. Lu A-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with blocking solution, the membrane was incubated with anti-hMYH peptide antibody α516 and subjected to Western blotting as described above. The DNA cleavage activity (DNA glycosylase activity followed by heating) of hMYH was assayed similarly as E. coli MutY glycosylase as described (46.Parker A. Gu Y. Lu A-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3206-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 47.Lu A-L. Vaughan P. DNA Repair Protocols: Prokaryotic Systems.

The DNA substrate is a 44-mer duplex DNA containing an A/8-oxoG mismatch, 5′­AATTGGGCTCCTCGAGGAATTAGCCTTCTGCAGGCATGCCCC¯GG­3′3′­TTAACCCGAGGAGCTCCTTAAOCGGAAGACGTCCGTACGGGGCC­5′ SEQUENCE1 where O represents 8-oxoG, and the underlined cytosines were32P-labeled. The synthesized oligonucleotides, 40-nucleotide long, were annealed to form a heteroduplex with 4-nucleotide 5′ sticky ends. The underlined cytosines on the mismatched A-containing strand were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow fragment. The hMYH glycosylase reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 0.25 nm partially purified recombinant hMYH (21.Gu Y. Lu A-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), 1.8 fmol of A/8-oxoG-containing DNA substrate, 75 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 μmZnCl2, and 1.45% glycerol. The reactions were performed at 37 °C for 1 h. After reactions, samples were lyophilized to dryness, resuspended in 3 μl of formamide dye (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated at 90 °C for 3 min, and loaded onto a 14% polyacrylamide, 8.3 m urea sequencing gel. The gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the cleavage products were analyzed by ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The reaction mixtures for hMYH and hMutSα binding activities on A/8-oxoG-containing DNA substrate were similar to that of the glycosylase assay, except that 30 mm NaCl and 0.5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) were added to the reactions. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and were supplemented by adding 2 μl of 50% glycerol. The protein-DNA complexes were then resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 50 mm Tris borate buffer containing 2.5% glycerol. The electrophoresis was carried out in a cold room with 20-mA current with 50 mm Tris borate buffer. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and the percentages of bound DNA were analyzed by Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant. Due to the fact that both hMYH base excision repair and mismatch repair can remove adenines mispaired with guanines or 8-oxoG lesions as a result of DNA replication errors (Fig. 1, reaction 3), we suspect that some relationship may exist between these two repair pathways. To investigate whether hMYH interacts with the human MutS homologs, GST-hMYH fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was added to TK6 lymphoblastoid cell extracts to pull down mismatch repair proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A (lane 2 in the top two panels), both hMSH2 and hMSH6 were found to bind to the GST-hMYH beads. However, hMSH3 did not interact with immobilized GST-hMYH (Fig. 2A, lane 2 in the bottom panel), and none of the above proteins bound to immobilized GST alone (Fig. 2A, lane 1 in all panels). This result indicates that hMYH interacts with the hMSH2/hMSH6 (hMutSα) heterodimer but not with the hMSH2/hMSH3 (hMutSβ) heterodimer. To determine which subunit of the hMSH2/hMSH6 heterodimer interacts with hMYH, we performed similar experiments with extracts from several mismatch repair-deficient cell lines, MT1, LoVo, and HCT15. MT1 cells, derived from TK6 cells, are resistant to killing by alkylating agents (49.Goldmacher V.S. Cuzick R.A. Thilly W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12462-12471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both alleles of the human MSH6 gene in the MT1 cell contain missense mutations (50.Papadopoulos N. Nicolaides N.C. Liu B. Parsons R. Lengauer C. Palombo F. D'Arrigo A. Markowitz S. Willson J.K. Kinzler K.W. Jiricny J. Vogelstein B. Science. 1995; 268: 1915-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). LoVo cells, with a large deletion in the human MSH2 gene, cannot express stable hMSH2 and hMSH6 (51.Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The human colon tumor line HCT15 carries a frameshift mutation in the human MSH6 gene (52.Boyer J.C. Umar A. Risinger J.I. Lipford R. Kane M. Barett J.C. Kolodner R.D. Kunkel T.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6063-6070PubMed Google Scholar) and has no hMSH6 but has normal expression of hMSH2 and hMSH3 (53.Chang D.K. Ricciardiello L. Goel A. Chang C.L. Boland C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18424-18431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). First, the protein levels of hMSH2, hMSH6, and hMYH in these cells were confirmed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, TK6 cells had high expression levels of hMSH2 and hMSH6 (lane 1 in panels 1 and 2) while MT1 cells contained a similar level of hMSH2 but a slightly lower level of hMSH6 (lane 2 in panels 1 and 2) as compared with TK6. No hMSH2 and hMSH6 were detected in LoVo cell extracts, and HCT15 cell extracts had no hMSH6 expression as reported previously (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4 in panels 1 and 2). The protein expression levels of hMYH were similar in all four cell lines (Fig. 2B, third panel). Thus, mismatch repair deficiency has no effect on hMYH protein expression and stability. As shown in Fig. 2A, hMSH2 and hMSH6 were not detected in the GST-hMYH beads when LoVo and HCT15 cell extracts were used (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5 in panels 1 and 2) and were weakly pulled down by immobilized GST-hMYH from MT1 cell extracts (Fig. 2A, lane 3in panels 1 and 2). Because HCT15 and MT1 cells contain mutant hMSH6 and LoVo cells do not express hMSH6, the physical interaction between hMYH and hMSH2/hMSH6 heterodimer (hMutSα) is probably mediated through hMSH6. Similar results were obtained by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an antibody against an hMYH peptide with the above four cell extracts and followed by Western blotting with antibodies against hMSH2 and hMSH6 (data not shown). Since both hMYH and hMutSα interact with PCNA (23.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 38.Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T. J. Biol.

To demonstrate a direct physical interaction of these two proteins, we performed affinity binding experiments with the GST-hMYH and highly purified recombinant hMutSα and hMutSβ proteins expressed in the baculovirus insect cell system. Because both hMutSα and hMutSβ contain hMSH2, an antibody against hMSH2 was used in the Western blot analyses. Two different forms of hMutSα were tested in the experiments.

However, the overall system behavior in intact cells is difficult to analyze because the dynamics of these components are interdependent. We used a combined experimental and computational approach to study Ran transport in vivo. The resulting model provides the first quantitative picture of Ran flux between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in eukaryotic cells. The model predicts that the Ran exchange factor RCC1, and not the flux capacity of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), is the crucial regulator of steady-state flux across the NPC. Moreover, it provides the first estimate of the total in vivo flux (520 molecules per NPC per second and predicts that the transport system is robust."

We find strong evidence for ice-sheet growth (+26.8 gigatons per year), in contrast to earlier estimates indicating a mass deficit (-20.9 gigatons per year). Average thickening is equal to approximately 25% of the accumulation rate, with most of this growth occurring on Ice Stream C. Whillans Ice Stream, which was thought to have a significantly negative mass balance, is close to balance, reflecting its continuing slowdown.

https://openalex.org/W2093828185,"The novel dendritic cell (DC)-specific human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) receptor DC-SIGN plays a key role in the dissemination of HIV-1 by DC. DC-SIGN is thought to capture HIV-1 at mucosal sites of entry, facilitating transport to lymphoid tissues, where DC-SIGN efficiently transmits HIV-1 to T cells. DC-SIGN is also important in the initiation of immune responses by regulating DC-T cell interactions through intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3). We have characterized the mechanism of ligand binding by DC-SIGN and identified the crucial amino acids involved in this process. Strikingly, the HIV-1 gp120 binding site in DC-SIGN is different from that of ICAM-3, consistent with the observation that glycosylation of gp120, in contrast to ICAM-3, is not crucial to the interaction with DC-SIGN. A specific mutation in DC-SIGN abrogated ICAM-3 binding, whereas the HIV-1 gp120 interaction was unaffected. This DC-SIGN mutant captured HIV-1 and infected T cells in trans as efficiently as wild-type DC-SIGN, demonstrating that ICAM-3 binding is not necessary for HIV-1 transmission. This study provides a basis for the design of drugs that inhibit or alter interactions of DC-SIGN with gp120 but not with ICAM-3 or vice versa and that have a therapeutic value in immunological diseases and/or HIV-1 infections. The novel dendritic cell (DC)-specific human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) receptor DC-SIGN plays a key role in the dissemination of HIV-1 by DC. DC-SIGN is thought to capture HIV-1 at mucosal sites of entry, facilitating transport to lymphoid tissues, where DC-SIGN efficiently transmits HIV-1 to T cells. DC-SIGN is also important in the initiation of immune responses by regulating DC-T cell interactions through intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3). We have characterized the mechanism of ligand binding by DC-SIGN and identified the crucial amino acids involved in this process. Strikingly, the HIV-1 gp120 binding site in DC-SIGN is different from that of ICAM-3, consistent with the observation that glycosylation of gp120, in contrast to ICAM-3, is not crucial to the interaction with DC-SIGN. A specific mutation in DC-SIGN abrogated ICAM-3 binding, whereas the HIV-1 gp120 interaction was unaffected. This DC-SIGN mutant captured HIV-1 and infected T cells in trans as efficiently as wild-type DC-SIGN, demonstrating that ICAM-3 binding is not necessary for HIV-1 transmission. This study provides a basis for the design of drugs that inhibit or alter interactions of DC-SIGN with gp120 but not with ICAM-3 or vice versa and that have a therapeutic value in immunological diseases and/or HIV-1 infections.

HIV-1 enters these cells through the interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 with its primary receptor CD4 and members of the chemokine receptor family, primarily CCR5 and CXCR4 (1.Chan D.C.

Mechanisms of early viral dissemination remain uncertain, but anatomical distribution and in vitro infectivity studies infer that immature dendritic cells (DC) residing in the skin and at mucosal surfaces are the first cells to be targeted by HIV-1 (3.Cameron P.U.

Captured pathogens are processed into antigenic peptides and presented on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules at the surface of DC. DC mature and migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs, where they interact with T cells to initiate an immune response. HIV-1 is thought to subvert the trafficking capacity of DC to gain access to the CD4+ T cell compartment of lymphoid tissues where DC enhance the infection of CD4+ T cells by HIV-1 (3.Cameron P.U.

The molecular basis behind this process remained unclear until we recently identified DC-SIGN (DC-specificICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin) through its high affinity interaction with the intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3) (7.Geijtenbeek T.B.H.

Scharnowske S. Watson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8356-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar)), and we demonstrated that DC-SIGN binds both M- and T-tropic HIV-1 and enhances infection of T cells in trans (8.Geijtenbeek T.B.H.

Furthermore, DC-SIGN is expressed by immature DC localized in those mucosal tissues involved in sexual transmission of HIV-1. Thus, DC-SIGN endows DC with the ability to efficiently capture HIV-1, even when the virus is present in minute amounts. HIV-1 subsequently exploits the migratory capacity of DC to gain access to the T cell areas of lymphoid tissues, where DC-SIGN enhances the infection of residing CD4+ T cells by HIV-1. The cellular ligand of DC-SIGN, ICAM-3, is highly expressed on naive T cells, and we demonstrated that DC-SIGN binding to ICAM-3 initiates the DC-T cell interaction necessary for T cell activation (7.Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Cell. 2000; 100: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Blocking antibodies against DC-SIGN inhibit the DC-T cell clustering and the subsequent T cell activation, demonstrating the importance of this first step in DC-T cell contact (7.Geijtenbeek T.B.H.

Here, we have investigated the mechanism of both ligand and Ca2+ binding by DC-SIGN. Strikingly, ICAM-3 recognition by DC-SIGN is dependent on N-glycosylation of the ligand, whereas HIV-1 gp120 binding is independent of both N- and O-linked glycosylations. Differences in ligand binding were further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and three-dimensional modeling. We generated a DC-SIGN mutant that specifically bound HIV-1 gp120 but not ICAM-3 and that efficiently mediated HIV-1 infection of T cells in trans. Thus, DC-SIGN has different binding sites for HIV-1 gp120 and ICAM-3. This information will be essential in the successful development of preventative and therapeutic strategies in the treatment of HIV-1 and opens up the possibility of designing drugs specifically inhibiting interactions of DC-SIGN with one ligand without affecting that of the other ligand. The monoclonal antibodies against DC-SIGN are AZN-D1 and AZN-D2 (7.Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G.

Quiroga through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Nonglycosylated HIV-1 gp120 was produced in yeast using an intracellular expression vector lacking the signal sequence, thereby preventing passage through the secretory pathway and thus the addition of carbohydrates (10.Haigwood N.L. Shuster J.R. Moore G.K. Lee H. Skiles P.V. Higgins K.W. Barr P.J. George-Nascimento C. Steimer K.S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 855-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Peptide-N-glycosidase F and endo-N-acetylgalactosaminidase were obtained from Oxford Glycosciences (Wakefield, MA). Mutations in the cDNA encoding DC-SIGN were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). K562 transfectants either expressing wild-type or mutant DC-SIGN were generated by transfection of K562 cells with 10 μg of plasmid by electroporation as described previously (8.Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L.M.H.A. Nottet H.S.L.M. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y.

Positive cells were sorted several times to obtain stable transfectants with similar expression levels of DC-SIGN. DC-SIGN-Fc consists of the extracellular portion of DC-SIGN (amino acid residues 64–404) fused at the C terminus to a human IgG1-Fc fragment into the Sig-pIgG1-Fc vector (11.Fawcett J. Holness C.L. Needham L.A. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Mason D.Y. Simmons D.L. Nature. 1992; 360: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN-Fc was produced in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells by co-transfection of DC-SIGN-Sig-pIgG1 Fc (20 μg) and pEE14 (5 μg) vector. DC-SIGN-Fc concentrations in the supernatant were determined by an anti-IgG1 ELISA. The fluorescent bead adhesion assay was performed as described earlier (7.Geijtenbeek T.B.H.

Adhesion was determined in the presence of either 5 mm mannan, 5 mm EGTA, or 20 μg/ml antibodies against DC-SIGN. The soluble DC-SIGN adhesion assay was performed as follows. Soluble ligands were coated in ELISA plates (1 μg/well) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. Soluble DC-SIGN-Fc supernatant was added, and the adhesion was performed for 30 min at 37 °C. Unbound DC-SIGN-Fc was washed away, and binding was determined by an anti-IgG1 ELISA. Specificity was determined in the presence of either 20 μg/ml blocking antibodies or 5 mmEGTA. The infection assays were performed as described previously (8.Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Kwon D.S.

Pseudotyped viral stocks were generated by calcium phosphate transfections of 293T cells with the proviral plasmid pNL-Luc-E−R−, containing a luciferase reporter gene and an expression plasmid for the ADA gp160 envelope. Briefly, DC-SIGN transfectants were incubated for 2 h with identical pseudotyped HIV-1ADA virus concentrations, unbound virus was washed away, and phytohemagglutinin-activated T cells were added. Cell lysates were obtained after 2 days and analyzed for luciferase activity. We have built the model of the C-type lectin domain of DC-SIGN by exploiting the sequence similarity to the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, which was solved using x-ray crystallography (12.Meier M. Bider M.D. Malashkevich V.N. Spiess M. Burkhard P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1DV8). The modeling was done with WHAT IF (13.Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3357) Google Scholar), following the protocol as previously described (14.Vriend G. Eijsink V. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 367-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Three insertions (Arg312-Phe313, Leu321-Asn322, and Tyr342) were added to the model of the asialoglycoprotein receptor by copying the respective loop conformations from two other homologous templates (Protein Data Bank entries 1ESL and 1HLJ) to provide a structure with high homology to the CRD of DC-SIGN. The model was minimized with the YASARA NOVA force field, which was parameterized for the refinement of homology models and was shown to routinely reduce the C<α> root mean square deviation. 2E. Krieger, unpublished results. With 50% sequence identity between DC-SIGN and the template 1DV8, homology modeling is commonly considered straightforward (14.Vriend G. Eijsink V. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 367-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Validation of the model with WHAT_CHECK (15.Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar) revealed no large problems in the model structure. The model coordinates are available on the World Wide Web at www.cmbi.kun.nl/gv/service/dcsign/. DC-SIGN, a type II transmembrane protein with a C-terminal C-type lectin domain, binds with high affinity to both the immunoglobulin superfamily member ICAM-3 (7.Geijtenbeek T.B.H.

Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L.M.H.A. Nottet H.S.L.M. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y.

We used K562 transfectants stably expressing DC-SIGN to specifically investigate the binding characteristics of DC-SIGN in the absence of any other ICAM-3- or HIV-1-receptors, since this erythroleukemic cell line does not express leukocyte function-associated molecule 1 and CD4. DC-SIGN expressed by these cells is fully functional (Fig. 1A), with a binding activity similar to that observed for DC-SIGN expressed by DC (7.Geijtenbeek T.B.H.

Cell. 2000; 100: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN-mediated adhesion to both ICAM-3 and gp120 is completely inhibited by the blocking antibodies against DC-SIGN, the calcium chelator EGTA, and the polysaccharide mannan (Fig. 1A). The Ca2+ dependence confirms that ligand binding is mediated by the C-type lectin domain of DC-SIGN, which interacts also with mannose-type carbohydrates, since adhesion to its natural ligands was inhibited by the polycarbohydrate mannan (Fig. 1A). Both ICAM-3 and gp120 are heavily glycosylated (16.Funatsu O. Sato T. Kotovuori P. Gahmberg C.G. Ikekita M. Furukawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17.Leonard C.K. Spellman M.W. Riddle L. Harris R.J. Thomas J.N. Gregory T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10373-10382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and these post-translational modifications could be important for the interaction with DC-SIGN. Enzymatic removal of the O-linked glycosylations from both ligands had no effect on their binding to DC-SIGN (Fig. 1B). HIV-1 gp120 contains O-linked glycosylations (18.Bernstein H.B. Tucker S.P. Hunter E. Schutzbach J.S. Compans R.W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 463-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis after deglycosylation (data not shown), whereas no shift in molecular weight was observed in ICAM-3 after endo-N-acetylgalactosaminidase treatment (data not shown), suggesting that ICAM-3 does not contain O-linked glycosylations. In contrast, removal of the N-linked glycosylations from ICAM-3 by peptide-N-glycosidase F completely abrogated the adhesion (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that N-linked carbohydrates are involved in this interaction. In contrast, treatment of HIV-1 gp120 with peptide-N-glycosidase F did not result in a decreased interaction. It is possible that the carbohydrates were not completely removed, although it appeared that the N-linked glycosylations had been removed from gp120 as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). Therefore, we used nonglycosylated recombinant gp120 and observed that DC-SIGN interacts with this nonglycosylated gp120 in a similar way as with native gp120, derived from mammalian cells (Fig. 1C). The interaction with nonglycosylated gp120 was blocked by the anti-DC-SIGN antibodies as well as by EGTA. These results confirm that glycosylations are not necessary for the interaction of HIV-1 gp120 with DC-SIGN, whereas N-linked but not O-linked oligosaccharides are essential for the binding of ICAM-3. DC-SIGN belongs to the C-type lectin family (Fig. 2A), and we decided to obtain structural information about the C-type lectin domain of DC-SIGN, through comparison with other C-type lectins, to identify crucial amino acid residues involved in ligand binding by site-directed mutagenesis. The CRD of DC-SIGN has 50% identity with that of the H1 subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (rat hepatic lectin-1 (RHL-1)) and 39% with that of the rat serum mannose-binding protein (MBP-A). We performed molecular modeling with the crystal structure of the RHL-1 (12.Meier M. Bider M.D. Malashkevich V.N. Spiess M. Burkhard P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) as a template because of the high identity with RHL-1, and we generated a three-dimensional structure of the C-type lectin domain of DC-SIGN (amino acid residues 267–381; Fig. 2B). The CRD of DC-SIGN is a globular protein consisting of 12 β-strands, two α-helices, and three disulfide bridges. The β-strands are arranged in three β-sheets and form the core of the protein with an α-helix on each side of this core. One prominent loop sticks out from the protein surface and forms part of the two Ca2+-binding sites, designated site 1 and site 2. Ca2+ is essential to the activity of DC-SIGN (Fig. 1A); thus, these sites are probably part of the ligand binding site. Amino acid sequence alignment of DC-SIGN with other C-type lectins indicates that four amino acids, Glu347, Asn349, Glu354, and Asn365, interact with the Ca2+ at site 2 through their carbonyl groups (Figs.2A and 3A). We hypothesized that these four amino acid residues might also participate in the interaction of DC-SIGN with its ligands via hydrogen bonds as was shown for other C-type lectins such as MBP-A (19.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to assess the role of these residues in ligand binding by DC-SIGN. Changing either Glu347 into Gln or Asn349 and Asn365 into Asp resulted in complete loss of both ICAM-3 and gp120 binding (Table I). Structural integrity was retained within these mutants, since the interaction with antibodies against DC-SIGN was unaffected (Table I). Loss of ligand binding due to these mutations could be ascribed to elimination of a single hydrogen bond between DC-SIGN and its ligand through removal of either a hydrogen donor (amide group in Asn) or acceptor (acidic group in Glu) (Fig. 3A). Ca2+ binding in these mutants will not be affected, since the altered amino acid residues (Glu into Gln and Asn into Asp) are still able to donate a carbonyl group to the interaction with Ca2+, as was also shown for other C-type lectins (19.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The amino acid residue Asp366 coordinates the Ca2+ion without contributing to the ligand binding (Fig. 3A). Mutation of Asp366 into Ala resulted in complete loss of ligand binding, which is contributed to loss of Ca2+binding (Table I).Table IFunctional characterization of the different DC-SIGN mutantsDC-SIGN mutantaStable K562 transfectants.AdhesionExpressionFunctionICAM-3gp120AZN-D1AZN-D2%%%%Wild type49399592E347Q049392Ligand and Ca2+ site 2 bindingN349D109496N365D209697D366A139491Ca2+site 2 bindingD320A279898E324A009595N350A119492Ca2+ site 1 bindingD355A029897a Stable K562 transfectants. Open table in a new tab The CRD of DC-SIGN binds two calcium ions (7.Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Cell. 2000; 100: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), and, as we demonstrated, the ligand binding site of DC-SIGN is situated at Ca2+ site 2. The Ca2+ at site 1, the so-called auxiliary site, is located opposite the protein loop (Fig. 2B). Sequence alignment suggests that the amino acid residues Asp320, Glu324, Asn350, and Asp355 are involved in the binding of this Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). This Ca2+ is important in the interaction of DC-SIGN with its ligands, since mutating the respective amino acid residues into Ala residues results in complete loss of ligand binding (Table I). These mutants are not able to bind the Ca2+ at site 1 because the change of either Glu, Asp, or Asn into Ala removes the carbonyl group at their respective positions necessary for the interaction with Ca2+, as has previously been shown for MBP-A (19.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The structure of these mutants is not changed dramatically, since they are still recognized by antibodies against DC-SIGN (Table I). Presumably, the Ca2+ at site 1 is essential to the correct positioning of the loops forming the primary ligand binding site as was shown for MBP-A (19.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). We have previously reported two antibodies, AZN-D1 and -D2 (7.Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Cell. 2000; 100: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), that interact specifically with DC-SIGN and completely inhibit the interaction of DC-SIGN with both HIV-1 gp120 and ICAM-3 (Fig. 1A). We determined the epitopes of these antibodies by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent screening of the different DC-SIGN mutants for antibody recognition. Mutagenesis of Lys368 into Ala abrogated binding by the antibody AZN-D1, whereas AZN-D2 did not bind to the Gln323 mutant (Fig. 3B). The structure of DC-SIGN shows that the AZN-D1 epitope is located in the active ligand binding site close to Ca2+site 2, whereas AZN-D2 interacts with amino acid residues on the other site of the protein loop close to Ca2+ site 1 (Fig. 3C). The Ca2+ at site 2 constitutes part of the ligand binding, whereas Ca2+ site 1 is involved in stabilizing the binding site. Thus, interference with these sites blocks the interaction of DC-SIGN with its ligands, confirming the importance of both Ca2+ sites for DC-SIGN function. The ligand binding site of the CRD of DC-SIGN forms a flat hydrophobic surface resembling a shallow trough, with the amino acid residue Val351 forming the edge of the pocket (Fig. 3, A and C). We investigated the role of this Val351residue in the binding activity of DC-SIGN by changing it into Gly, thereby removing the β-carbon of Val, which has been shown in similar C-type lectins to be important (20.Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, this amino acid residue is essential for binding of DC-SIGN to ICAM-3, since the adhesion is completely abolished (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the mutant is still able to bind the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 to a similar extent as wild-type DC-SIGN (Fig. 4A). The Ca2+ dependence of the interaction of the V351G mutant with gp120 is lower than that of wild-type DC-SIGN, but even at high Ca2+ concentrations the V351G mutant is unable to interact with ICAM-3 (Fig. 4B), confirming a complete loss of ICAM-3 binding activity. These data demonstrate that the interaction of DC-SIGN with ICAM-3 is distinct from that with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 and that the V351G mutant plays an essential role in ICAM-3 but not in gp120 binding. Previously, we demonstrated that DC capture HIV-1 through DC-SIGN and that DC-SIGN-bound HIV-1 is efficiently transmitted to T cells, producing a vigorous infection of T cells (8.Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L.M.H.A. Nottet H.S.L.M. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Cell. 2000; 100: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar). The V351G mutant is able to bind HIV-1 (Fig. 4A), and we investigated whether this mutant is able to transmit HIV-1 to T cells. K562 transfectants expressing the V351G mutant were incubated with M-tropic HIV-1 for 2 h, and unbound virus was washed away. Activated T cells were co-cultured with the HIV-1-pulsed K562 transfectants expressing the V351G mutant, and this resulted in a productive infection of T cells similar to that observed with wild-type DC-SIGN (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained with T-tropic HIV-1 strains (results not shown). Thus, the V351G mutant is able to both capture HIV-1 and transmit the virus to activated T cells. These results also demonstrate that the ICAM-3-binding activity is not essential for transmission of HIV-1 by DC-SIGN. Sexual transmission of HIV-1 involves dissemination of the virus from the mucosal tissues to the lymphoid organs where the target T cells reside. DC are thought to mediate this process (3.Cameron P.U. Freudenthal P.S. Barker J.M. Gezelter S. Inaba K. Steinman R.M.

Following our previous study, which demonstrated the transcriptional repression of the IL-1β gene by HSF1 (Cahill, C. M., Waterman, W. R., Xie, Y., Auron, P. E., and Calderwood, S. K. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 24874–24879), we have examined the mechanisms of transcriptional repression. Our studies show that HSF1 represses the lipopolyliposaccharide-induced transcription of the IL-1β promoter through direct interaction with the nuclear factor of interleukin 6 (NF-IL6, also known asCCAAT enhancer bindingprotein (C/EBPβ), an essential regulator in IL-1β transcription. We show for the first time that HSF1 binds directly to NF-IL6 in vivo and antagonizes its activity. The HSF1/NF-IL6 interaction involves a sequence of HSF1 containing the trimerization and regulatory domains and the bZip region of NF-IL6. HSF1 has little effect on IL-1β promoter activity stimulated by the essential monocytic transcription factor Spi.1 but is strongly inhibitory to transcriptional activation by NF-IL6 and to the synergistic activation by NF-IL6 and Spi.1. Because of its ability to bind to specific C/EBP elements in the promoters of multiple genes and its ability to interact with other transcription factors, NF-IL6 is involved in transcriptional regulation of a wide range of genes. Interaction between HSF1 and NF-IL6 could thus be an important mechanism in HSF1 regulation of general gene transcription during endotoxin stress.

We and others have demonstrated that HSF1 may carry out this function through transcriptional repression of cytokine genes, including TNFα, and IL-1β, suggesting a role for HSF1 in antagonizing the acute phase response (APR) through transcriptional repression of APR-mediating genes (1.Cahill C.M.

The expression and function of IL-1β in humans are regulated at a number of different levels. These include modulation of transcription, mRNA stabilization, posttranslational proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β, and inhibition of IL-1β receptor binding by a naturally occurring IL-1β antagonist (1.Cahill C.M.

The regulation of IL-1β gene transcription is dependent upon the activity of the myeloid-specific transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1 (14.Moreau-Gachelin F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 149-163PubMed Google Scholar), which binds specifically to multiple elements in proximal IL-1β promoter and activates transcription (11.Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar). Spi-1 has also been shown to be a major determinant in myeloid-specific expression of the integrin cell surface receptor CD11b (15.Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.E. Chen H.M. Galson D.L. Maki R.A.

Hashimoto S. Sugita T. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1992; 79: 460-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Zhang Y. Rom W.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3831-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that NF-IL6 is necessary for activation of IL-1β transcription by LPS and is capable of synergistically cooperating with Spi-1, resulting in strong activation of the IL-1β core promoter (1.Cahill C.M.

Because IL-1β is a cytokine immediately responding to a wide variety of proinflammatory agents and affecting the function of a wide variety of targets, negative regulation of IL-1β expression is crucial for limiting potentially damaging aspects of inflammation and maintaining balance in the host. At the physiological level, IL-1β expression is subject to feedback inhibition through the release of glucocorticoids following stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and antagonism of IL-1β expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels (23.Knudsen P.J. Dinarello C.A. Strom T.B. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 4129-4134PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Fenton M.J. Vermeulen M.W. Clark B.D. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. J.

The inhibition of the expression of IL-1β and a number of other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TNF-α, and interferon γ, has been observed at elevated temperatures in the fever range, suggesting the existence of a thermally regulated feedback inhibitory mechanism (27.Dinarello C.A.

More recently, it has been shown that HSF1 plays an essential function in protection against endotoxemia, and transgenic mice with disrupted Hsf1 genes die rapidly when exposed to endotoxin (6.Xiao X. Zuo X. Davis A.A. McMillan D.R. Curry B.B. Richardson J.A. Benjamin I.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that HSF1 functions at least partially through repression of proinflammatory cytokines, and we have shown transcriptional repression of the IL-1β gene mediated by HSF1 (1.Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also discovered that the repression of IL-1β transcription by HSF1 is dependent on an intact NF-IL6-binding element adjacent to the HSF1-binding element on the proximal IL-1β promoter (1.Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of NF-IL6 involvement in the transcriptional repression. In this report, we have investigated the functional and physical interactions between HSF1 and NF-IL6 and their role in transcriptional repression of IL-1β gene. The human monocytic cell line THP-1, the human cervix adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa S3, and Chinese hamster ovaricytes from the cell line CHO K1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.0 mml-glutamine, and 5 × 10−5mβ-mercaptoethanol. The HeLa and CHO K1 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2.0 mml-glutamine. The IL-1β core promoter reporter gene, pGL3/IL-1DT, contains the sequence of −59 to +12 of the human IL-1β gene cloned into pGL3.Basic. The transfection efficiency control vector, pCMV-βGal, contains the β-galactosidase coding sequence controlled by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The HSF1 expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(−)/HSF1, contains the human HSF1 coding sequence driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter in mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen) (30.Chen C. Xie Y. Stevenson M.A. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A series of C-terminal truncations of HSF1, pHSF1/1–379, pHSF1/1–329, pHSF1/1–279, and pHSF1/1–179 were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis using pcDNA3.1(−)/HSF1 as template. The expression plasmid for the full-length NF-IL6, pcDNA3.1(−)/NF-IL6, was derived by cloning full-length NF-IL6 cDNA into pcDNA3.1(−). A truncated form of NF-IL6, pcDNA3.1(−)/NF-IL6-bZIP, was prepared from an internal SplI deletion (amino acids 41–205) of the transactivation domain from the full-length NF-IL6 cDNA, which retained the intact bZIP region (31.Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pcDNA3.1(+)/HSF-2A, which contains the coding sequence of HSF-2A, was used in in vitro protein interaction assays as control. The expression plasmid for the GST-HSF1 fusion protein contains the full-length HSF1 coding sequence inserted in frame downstream of the coding sequence for glutathione S-transferase in pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The expression plasmid for the GST-NF-IL6-bZIP fusion protein contains the truncated NF-IL6 cDNA inserted in pGEX vector and is designated as GST/NF-IL6-bZIP. The control plasmid, pGEX-2T, was used to produce the GST control protein. THP-1 cells were treated as described in the figure legends before RNA extraction. Total RNA (1 μg) from different samples was reverse transcribed from IL-1β, HSP70, or β-actin reverse primer, and the resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using both forward and reverse primers for IL-1β, HSP70, or β-actin genes. The primers used in RT-PCR are: 5′-AAACAGATGAAGTGCTCCTTCAGG-3′ (IL-1β forward), 5′-TGGAGAACACCACTTGTTGCTCCA-3′ (IL-1β reverse), 5′-TCATCGCCAACGACCAGGGCA-3′ (HSP70 forward), 5′-AGCCCAGGTACGCCTCGGCGA-3′ (HSP70 reverse), 5′-GCCAGCTCACCATGGAT-3′ (β-actin forward), and 5′-AGGGGGGCCTCGGTCAC-3′ (β-actin reverse). THP-1 cells (2 × 107) were treated as described in the figure legends, washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 4 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation (500 ×g, 5 min) at 4 °C and resuspended in 100 μl of storage buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 40 units of RNasin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To 100 μl of nuclei, 100 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mmMgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CTP, 1 mm GTP), and 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking. RNA was then extracted from the nuclear run-on reaction using Trizol LS (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmid DNA containing cDNA probes were linearized and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The probes were denatured and slot blotted onto Hybond N+ membranes. The membranes were prehybridized using UltraHyb solution (Ambion) for 2 h at 42 °C before equivalent counts (106 cpm) of newly transcribed RNA from each run reaction were added to the solution. Hybridization proceeded for 24 h at 42 °C. The membranes were then washed twice for 20 min at 42 °C in low stringency solution (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS), twice for 20 min at 42 °C in high stringency solution (1× SSC, 0.1% SDS), and once for 30 min at 37 °C in low stringency solution containing 10 μg of RNase A. The membranes were finally rinsed with low stringency solution, and the results were visualized by autoradiography. For high level of stable expression of NF-IL6, CHO K1 cells were transfected with NF-IL6 expression vector containing the neomycin-resistant gene. A selection medium containing 300 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) was then used to select transfected cells, and the neomycin-resistant cells were cloned and screened for NF-IL6 expression by Western analysis. For promoter activity analysis, transient transfection was carried out using liposomal transfection reagent DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Unless specified in the figure legends, the cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates at 4 × 104/well and cultured for 18 h before being transfected with 0.4 μg/well of IL-1β promoter reporter construct. As the control for transfection efficiency, 0.2 μg/well of pCMV-βGal expression vector was simultaneously transfected. For co-expression assays, a total 0.4 μg/well of expression vector for transcription factors were used. The cells were harvested 18–24 h after transfection, and the luciferase activity and β-galactosidase expression levels were assayed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega). The promoter activities were normalized in relative light units/milliunit of β-galactosidase activity. Nuclear or whole cell extracts were incubated with anti-HSF1 or anti-NF-IL6 (C/EBPβ) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were mixed with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with hypotonic cell extraction buffer. After the final wash, the samples were resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked in 1× TBS (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with a specific rabbit anti-HSF1 polyclonal antibody or anti-C/EBPβ polyclonal antibody. The membranes were then washed and incubated with a second antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enzyme immunoassay (ABC; Vector Laboratories) or chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). HSF1 and NF-IL6 were produced in vitro from pcDNA3.1(−)/HSF1, pcDNA3.1(−)/NF-IL6, and pcDNA3.1(−)/NF-IL6-bZIP using a TNT Quick T7 transcription/translation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). PCR mutagenesis-generated expression vectors of HSF1 with C-terminal deletions, pHSF1/1–379, pHSF1/1–279, and pHSF1/1–179, were used as templates in vitro to produce the truncated proteins HSF1/1–379, HSF1/1–279, and HSF1/1–179. The in vitro translated proteins were checked for size on SDS-PAGE and for the binding properties to oligonucleotides containing specific binding motifs for HSF1 and NF-IL6 using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Briefly, the cells were incubated for 10 min on ice in 200 μl of CERI solution containing 0.75 mm PMSF, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 20 mm NaF, and 2.0 mmNa3VO4. 11 μl of CERII solution was than added, and cytoplasmic extracts were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The nuclear pellets were lysed in 100 μl of NER solution containing 2 mm PMSF, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. The extracts were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and labeled by end filling with 32P. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in EMSA are shown below: 1) consensus HSE from human hsp70A gene, 5′-CACCTCGGCTGGAATATTCCCGACCTGGCAGCCGA-3′; and 2) IL-1β promoter fragment containing binding elements for PU.1-NF-IL6, 5′-TTTCACAATCAAGTTAAAGGAAAGGGGAAAAG-3′. Each binding mixture (12 μl) for EMSA contained 2.0 μl of nuclear extract or 10 μl of in vitro translated protein, 2.0 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2.0 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.5–1.0 ng of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe, 12 mm HEPES, 12% glycerol, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.9 mmMgCl2, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 mm PMSF, and 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin (pH 7.9). Final concentrations of KCl in the binding mixture were defined for optimal binding of each oligonucleotide. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then electrophoresed on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels. The results were visualized by autoradiography. To produce GST fusion proteins and control GST protein, 250-ml cultures of Escherichia coli DH5α cells expressing GST/NF-IL6-bZIP fusion protein, GST/HSF1 fusion protein, or GST control protein were incubated by shaking at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.4–0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to the bacterial culture to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce GST fusion protein expression. GST proteins were prepared as described previously (32.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). For each in vitro protein binding reaction, 50 pmol of GST fusion protein or GST control protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and then incubated with 20–25 μl of in vitro translated,35S-labeled proteins in 500 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 2.0 mm PMSF, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5.0 μg/ml leupeptin. The binding reaction was carried out at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle rocking. The protein-GST beads were washed five times with binding buffer and analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. As input controls, 1 μl of in vitro translation samples was run in parallel with relevant binding reactions. We have previously demonstrated inhibition of LPS-stimulated IL-1β mRNA expression by heat shock and LPS-stimulated IL-1β promoter activity by HSF1 overexpression (1.Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using RT-PCR, we confirmed our earlier observation. IL-1β is not expressed in THP-1 monocytic cells prior to stimulation, but addition of LPS from E. coli leads to strong induction of IL-1β (Fig. 1A). Heat shock strongly induced HSP70 but inhibited LPS-induced IL-1β expression (Fig. 1A). To determine whether heat shock repression of IL-1β mRNA was due to inhibition of transcription, nuclear run-on analyses were performed. Fig. 1B compares the transcription rates of a number of genes in THP-1 cells treated with heat shock, LPS, or LPS plus heat shock. Consistent with previous observations in other systems (1.Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Singh I.S. Viscardi R.M. Kalvakolanu I. Calderwood S. Hasday J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9841-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), LPS strongly induced the transcription of both IL-1β and TNF-α genes, whereas heat shock inhibited the transcription of both genes stimulated by LPS (Fig. 1B). Previous studies have shown that the IL-1β and TNF-α genes respond to LPS stimulation with strong and rapid induction of expression (33.Fenton M.J. Clark B.D. Collins K.L. Webb A.C. Rich A. Auron P.E. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3972-3979PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Sariban E. Imamura K. Luebbers R. Kufe D. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, the level of IL-1β transcription is higher than that of TNF-α upon LPS treatment. This could be because of the differences either in the response to LPS stimulation or in the kinetics of transcription activation (Fig. 1B). We have also tested the effect of heat shock on constitutive transcription of another monocytic gene, c -fms, which encodes the receptor of macrophage colony-stimulating factor or colony-stimulating factor-1. As shown Fig. 1B, c -fms is constitutively transcribed in monocytic cells and is repressed by heat shock. This result is consistent with our previous observations that HSF1 activated either by heat shock or overexpression from an HSF1 expression vector represses c -fms promoter activity in transfection assays. 2Xie, Y., Chen, C., Stevenson, M., Hume, D., Avron, P., and Calderwood, S. (2002) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 291, 1071–1080. As controls, we show that HSP70 transcription is induced by heat shock in the absence and presence of LPS, whereas transcription of the housekeeping gene β-actin was not affected. Because our previous studies indicated that repression of the IL-1β promoter by heat was a direct effect of HSF1, we next examined potential mechanisms of IL-1β repression by HSF1. Our earlier genetic studies identified NF-IL6 as an important transcription factor involved in IL-1β transactivation in response to LPS stimulation (1.Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12.Yang Z. Wara-Aswapati N. Chen C. Tsukada J. Auron P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21272-21277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our studies have also suggested the involvement of NF-IL6 in HSF1-mediated repression of IL-1β transcription because mutation of the NF-IL6-binding site adjacent to the HSF1-binding site in the IL-1β promoter abolished transcriptional repression by HSF1 (1.Cahill C.M. Waterman W.R. Xie Y. Auron P.E. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24874-24879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined direct interactions between HSF1 and NF-IL6 by co-immunoprecipitation assays. We firstly attempted co-immunoprecipitation using monocytic cell lines treated with LPS and PMA, which activate NF-IL6, and heat shock, which activates HSF1. For reasons not clear to us, we were not able to obtain a NF-IL6 level that was high enough to unambiguously demonstrate HSF1/NF-IL6 association in the nuclear extracts when cells were either treated with a physiological concentration of LPS and/or PMA or treated with heat shock (data not shown). However, physical interaction of HSF1 and NF-IL6 was strongly suggested from our previous study, which showed that in vitro translated NF-IL6 inhibits the DNA binding activity of HSF1 in CHO K1 cells using EMSA (35.Tang D.

Titin's force is derived from its extensible I-band region, which, in the cardiac isoform, comprises three main extensible elements: tandem Ig segments, the PEVK domain, and the N2B unique sequence (N2B-Us). Using atomic force microscopy, we characterized the single molecule force-extension curves of the PEVK and N2B-Us spring elements, which together are responsible for physiological levels of passive force in moderately to highly stretched myocardium. Stretch-release force-extension curves of both the PEVK domain and N2B-Us displayed little hysteresis: the stretch and release data nearly overlapped. The force-extension curves closely followed worm-like chain behavior. Histograms of persistence length (measure of chain bending rigidity) indicated that the single molecule persistence lengths are ∼1.4 and ∼0.65 nm for the PEVK domain and N2B-Us, respectively. Using these mechanical characteristics and those determined earlier for the tandem Ig segment (assuming folded Ig domains), we modeled the cardiac titin extensible region in the sarcomere and calculated the extension of the various spring elements and the forces generated by titin, both as a function of sarcomere length.

Titin forms a striated muscle-specific myofilament that develops passive force in response to sarcomere stretch (for a recent review with original citations, see Ref. 1.Granzier, H., and Labeit, S. (2002) @@[email protected]@J. Physiol. (Lond.)@@/[email protected]@, in pressGoogle Scholar). Titin's force is generated by serially linked and mechanically distinct spring elements (2.Freiburg A.

Tandem Ig segments (tandemly arranged Ig-like domains) and the PEVK domain (rich in proline, glutamate, valine, and lysine residues) are spring elements found in both cardiac and skeletal muscle titins (3.Linke W.A.

For example, in human, the PEVK domain varies from 188 residues in the cardiac-specific N2B isoform to 2181 residues in skeletal soleus muscle (2.Freiburg A. Trombitas K. Hell W. Cazorla O.

The three-spring system of cardiac titin results in a unique force-extension curve that underlies the majority of the physiological passive tensions of the myocardium, and the variable-length tandem Ig and PEVK elements allows passive tension to be adjusted so that it matches the mechanical demands placed on normal and diseased myocardium (8.Wu Y.

N2B unique sequence worm-like chain atomic force microscopy/microscope piconewton(s) polyproline Immunoelectron microscopy has shown that in slack sarcomeres (no external force), the tandem Ig segments are in a “contracted” state. When the sarcomeres are stretched, the segments greatly extend (4.Trombitas K. Greaser M. Labeit S. Jin J.P. Kellermayer M. Helmes M. Granzier H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) due to unbending of linkers between folded Ig domains (4.Trombitas K. Greaser M. Labeit S. Jin J.P. Kellermayer M. Helmes M.

The tandem Ig segments exhibit worm-like chain (WLC) behavior with a persistence length (measure of chain bending rigidity) that is relatively long (13.5 nm based on a recent single molecule study) (11.Tskhovrebova L. Trinick J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 755-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), explaining why tandem Ig segment extension dominates in moderately stretched sarcomeres where passive force is low (4.Trombitas K. Greaser M. Labeit S. Jin J.P. Kellermayer M. Helmes M. Granzier H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The PEVK domain extends at relatively high forces (4.Trombitas K. Greaser M. Labeit S. Jin J.P. Kellermayer M. Helmes M. Granzier H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and this process is likely to result from straightening of random coil and polyproline II helices that comprise this element (12.Ma K. Kan L. Wang K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Single molecule (13.Kellermayer M.S. Smith S.B. Granzier H.L. Bustamante C.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) studies of skeletal muscle titin suggest that the PEVK domain acts as a WLC with a persistence length of ∼2 nm, whereas recent single molecule work on the cardiac PEVK domain (“N2B isoform”) revealed persistence lengths that range from 0.4 to 2.5 nm (14.Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As for cardiac-specific N2B-Us, immunoelectron microscopy has well established that this sequence extends in the cardiac sarcomere (5.Helmes M. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kellermayer M. Labeit S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), forming the cardiac titin third spring element. The molecular mechanical characteristics of this spring have not yet, however, been determined. Here we investigated the extensibility of the cardiac titin PEVK element and N2B-Us using an atomic force microscope (AFM) specialized for stretching single molecules. Both the PEVK domain and N2B-Us displayed little force hysteresis during stretch-release cycles, and their force-extension curves followed WLC behavior. Persistence length histograms revealed multiple peaks, with the main peak at the longest length occurring at ∼1.4 and ∼0.65 nm for the PEVK domain and N2B-Us, respectively. Assuming that these peaks reflect the persistence length of the single molecule allowed us to predict, within experimental error, the measured extensible behavior of the titin spring elements in the cardiac sarcomere as well as the passive force-sarcomere length relation of cardiac myocytes. We conclude that the serially linked WLC model with mechanically distinct springs using parameters established in this work closely describes the in vivo behavior of cardiac titin. Cardiac titin cDNA fragments (see Fig. 1) were amplified by PCR using primer pairs derived from the human cardiac titin N2B isoform (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number X90568). Fragments were cloned into modified pET vectors, expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS cells, and purified from the soluble fraction on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid columns with a His-Bind purification kit (Novagen, Madison, WI). Fragment boundaries from the human cardiac N2B isoform corresponded to I91–98 2We used the domain numbering system of Bang et al. (41.Bang M.L. Centner T. Fornoff F. Geach A.J. Gotthardt M. McNabb M.

Res. 2001; 89: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) throughout this work, but made references to the previous nomenclature of Labeit and Kolmerer (18.Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) wherever necessary. (residues 5237–5959), the PEVK domain with flanking Ig domains (residues 4337–4713), and N2B-Us (residues 3671–4242). We also used the skeletal muscle-specific fragment I65–70, with residues 7005–7572 (human soleus skeletal muscle titin, GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number X90569) as the fragment boundaries. Purified proteins were dialyzed into assay buffer (AB) (25 mmimidazole HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 m KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% NaN3, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), quick-frozen, and stored at −80 °C until later use. Molecules were stretched using a molecular force probe (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA), an AFM specialized for stretching molecules. The molecular force probe was mounted on a custom-built, low profile, inverted light microscope constructed of damped mechanical posts (Thorlabs) attached to an anti vibration table. Protein fragments (at concentrations of 200 μg/ml for poly-Ig fragments, 50 μg/ml for the PEVK domain, and 125 μg/ml for N2B-Us) were allowed to bind to pre-cleaned glass microscope slides for 20 min for poly-Ig fragments, 3 min for the PEVK domain, and 8 min for the N2B-Us (see also “Results”). Unbound molecules were washed away with AB assay buffer. Molecules were stretched in AB assay buffer by first pressing the cantilever (ThermoMicroscopes MSCT AUHW) against the titin-coated surface and then pulling the cantilever away with a predetermined rate. Force versus displacement curves were collected in repeated stretch and release cycles. The results shown in this work were all obtained at a velocity of 0.5 μm/s. The displacement of the cantilever base was measured using an integrated linear voltage differential transformer. Force (F) was obtained from cantilever bending (Δd) as F =KΔd, where K is cantilever stiffness. Stiffness was obtained for each unloaded cantilever by measuring its mean thermally driven vertical bending and applying the equipartition theorem: K〈Δd2〉 =kB T, where kBis the Boltzmann constant and T is absolute temperature. Cantilever stiffness was typically ∼10 pN/nm, and the root mean square force noise at the 0–1000-Hz bandwidth used in this work was ∼5 pN. Force versus displacement curves were corrected for several factors to obtain force versus molecular end-to-end length. 1) The zero-length, zero-force data point was obtained from the force response that corresponded to the cantilever tip reaching (or departing from) the substrate surface. 2) Forces were corrected for the base-line slope obtained from the force response of the displaced but unloaded cantilever. 3) Finally, the end-to-end length (z) of the tethered molecule was calculated by correcting the cantilever base displacement (s) with cantilever bending as z = s −F/K. Force data were compared with the WLC equation:FA/kB T =z/L + 1/(4(1 −z/L)2) − 1/4 (15.Bustamante C. Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Smith S. Science. 1994; 265: 1599-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). The WLC model describes the molecule as a deformable continuum of persistence length A (measure of bending rigidity) and contour length L. The end-to-end length of the molecule is z, and the fractional extension is z/L. The results in Fig. 2D were obtained by fitting a WLC equation to release forces of <100 pN. This force range was similar to that used for PEVK and N2B-Us experiments (see “Results”), and it limited enthalpic contributions to the force-extension curves due to bond angle deformations at high force (16.Rief M. Gautel M. Schemmel A. Gaub H.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 3008-3014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). (Note that using different force ranges did not affect the conclusions of this work.) For fitting, we used Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear fits of the WLC model (written in Igor-Pro and Kailedagraph). The elastic region of cardiac titin (N2B isoform) in the sarcomere was modeled as three serially linked WLCs with different contour and persistence lengths: the tandem Ig segments, the PEVK segment, and N2B-Us. The contour length of the tandem Ig segments (proximal + distal segments) was calculated from their combined number of Ig domains (the Ig domains of the N2B element were included) multiplied by a domain spacing of 4.5 nm (17.Improta S. Politou A.S. Pastore A. Structure. 1996; 4: 323-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) in a completely extended chain (40 domains × 4.5 nm =180 nm). (Note that this assumes that all domains are folded. For calculations that involve unfolding, see below.) The persistence length of the native tandem Ig segment was set as 13.5 nm based on the recent study by Tskhovrebova and Trinick (11.Tskhovrebova L. Trinick J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 755-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The contour lengths of the PEVK domain and N2B-Us were obtained from their number of amino acid residues times the maximal residue spacing in an unfolded polypeptide (0.38 nm). The number of PEVK residues in human titin N2B was determined assuming that the C-terminal end of the flanking Ig domain I27 is given by the amino acid sequence TVTV and the N-terminal end of the flanking I84 by PLKF, resulting in 188 PEVK residues and a PEVK contour length of 71.4 nm (188 × 0.38 nm). The number of N2B-Us residues is 572 in human, giving rise to a 217.4-nm contour length. For calculations of extensibility of rat cardiac titin (for Fig. 6), we took into account the slightly shorter N2B-Us and PEVK sequences in this species 3M. Greaser, manuscript in preparation. and used 199.8 and 70.7 nm as contour lengths. The persistence lengths of the PEVK domain and N2B-Us were set at 1.4 and 0.65 nm, respectively (see “Results”). (For details regarding the composition of tandem Ig segments, the PEVK domain, and N2B-Us, see Ref. 18.Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar and GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number X90568.) Because the tandem Ig, PEVK, and N2B-Us segments are connected in series, they bear equal forces. Therefore, for a given force, the extension of each segment (zIg, zPEVK, and zN2B-Us) can be calculated. We may then calculate for that force the total extension of the titin elastic segment (zIg + zPEVK + zN2B-Us). By adding the total length of non-extensible sarcomeric components (1800 nm) (see Ref. 19.Trombitas K. Jin J.P. Granzier H. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the sarcomere length can be calculated ((zIg +zPEVK + zN2B-Us) × 2 + 1800 nm), and the predicted force-sarcomere length relation constructed. The above calculations assume that the PEVK domain comprises solely random coil structure. However, it is likely that some of the residues form PP helices (see “Discussion”). Therefore, we calculated the apparent persistence length of the PEVK segment (cardiac N2B isoform) assuming that the PP residues are either type II or I. A search for P XPP, P XXPP, and XP XXPP motifs (cf. Ref. 12.Ma K. Kan L. Wang K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggested that 7 of the total 188 PEVK residues (or 3.7%) are part of polyproline helices. (Note that this is slightly less than for the large soleus PEVK domain, in which 7.8% of the residues are predicted to be part of the PP motifs, but much less than the 57% of the residues in the 28-residue fetal titin fragment used by Ma et al. (12.Ma K. Kan L. Wang K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).) The 0.31- and 0.19-nm translations per residue for PPII and PPI helices, respectively, allow the contour lengths of 7-residue PPII and PPI helices to be calculated. We assumed that the persistence lengths of PPII and PPI helices are 1000 and 0.1 nm, respectively (these values are extremes, with 1000 and 0.1 nm representing ultra-high and ultra-low stiffness, respectively), and that there is no conversion between the two PP states under our experimental loading conditions (cf. Li et al. (14.Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar)). The persistence length of the remaining 179 PEVK residues that form a random coil was set at 1.4 nm (see “Results”), and the contour length at 68 nm (179 × 0.38 nm). We then calculated the force-extension curve of the 179-residue random coil region linked with either the 7-residue PPII or PPI helix (following the methods explained above). The apparent persistence length of the PP helix-containing PEVK segment was obtained by fitting the curve with the WLC model (for results, see “Discussion”). We also calculated the effect of unfolding of the PPII helix on the force-extension curve of the PEVK domain. Before unfolding, we assumed that these 7 residues had contour and persistence lengths of 2.17 nm (7 × 0.31 nm) and 1000 nm, respectively. After conversion of the PPII helix to a random coil, we assumed that the values were 2.66 nm (7 × 0.38 nm) and 1.4 nm, respectively. We then calculated the overall contour and persistence lengths of the PEVK domain and used these values to calculate the WLC force of the PEVK element before and after unfolding. The above-described calculations of extension and force in the sarcomere assume that Ig domain unfolding does not occur during sarcomere stretch. To ascertain whether this is a valid assumption, we calculated the probability of domain unfolding by superimposing domain unfolding/refolding kinetics on the WLC force-extension curve (see above). To model domain unfolding/refolding, Monte-Carlo simulations were carried out based on previously used simulation algorithms (13.Kellermayer M.S. Smith S.B. Granzier H.L. Bustamante C. Science. 1997; 276: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 20.Kellermayer M.S. Smith S. Bustamante C. Granzier H.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 481: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For a given force (F), the number of unfolded/refolded domains was calculated according to the following equation: d N =Nω0d te−(Ea−FΔx)/kBT, where d N is the change in the number of folded domains during the d t polling interval and N is the number of available folded domains. The attempt frequency (ω0) was 108 (21.Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar), and kB T was 4.14 pNnm. The activation energies (Ea) for unfolding and refolding and the widths (Δx) of the unfolding and refolding potentials were user-adjustable. In all simulations, we assumed for refolding Ea = 82 pNnm (corresponding to a zero-force refolding rate of 2.5 s−1) and Δx = 2.3 nm (based on measurements for I91) (22.Li H. Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1117-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The Δx unfolding values were obtained from previous work, and unfolding activation energies were calculated from published unfolding rate constants at zero force (α0): native titin, Δx = 0.3 nm and α0 = 3.3 × 10−5 s−1 (16.Rief M. Gautel M. Schemmel A. Gaub H.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 3008-3014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar); I91 (formerly I27), Δx = 0.25 nm and α0 = 6 × 10−4 s−1 (22.Li H. Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1117-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); I92 (or I28), Δx = 0.25 nm (23.Oberhauser A.F. Hansma P.K. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and α0 = 2.5 × 10−6 s−1; I91–98, Δx = 0.25 nm and α0 = 6.1 × 10−5s−1 4K. Watanabe, C. Muhle-Goll, M. Kellermayer, S. Labeit, and H. Granzier, submitted for publication. ; and I65–70, Δx = 0.35 nm and α0 = 1 × 10−5 s−1.4 Following each calculation step, the domain unfolding process was permitted or prohibited depending on a comparison of d N with a number generated randomly between 0 and 1. Unfolding events decreased the number of remaining folded domains and the length of the folded segment by 4.5 nm and increased the length of the unfolded segment by 30 nm. Refolding events increased the number of folded domains and the length of the folded segment by 4.5 nm and decreased the length of the unfolded segment by 30 nm. Calculations were carried out using a stretch-release protocol with a constant velocity of 100 nm/s (to match the velocity used during force measurements on cardiac cells; see below) and a stretch amplitude determined by the preset maximal allowable force. This maximal force was selected at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, and 70 pN. Simulations were repeated 1000 times, and the total number of domains that unfolded (x) was determined. The probability of unfolding was then defined as x/1000. Calculations and simulations were conducted using Object Pascal (Metrowerks CodeWarrior Version 10) on a Power Macintosh G3 computer. We used our previously determined passive tension-sarcomere length relation measured with a stretch velocity of 100 nm/s on rat cardiac myocytes (rat expresses primarily cardiac titin N2B) (5.Helmes M. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kellermayer M. Labeit S. Linke W.A. Granzier H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We converted passive tensions (force/mm2 of cross-sectional area of myocyte) to force per titin molecule, taking into account that only 82% of the cell's cross-section contains myofibrils (5.Helmes M. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kellermayer M. Labeit S. Linke W.A. Granzier H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the average area in the cross-section of the myofibril occupied by a single thick filament was calculated as d1,02 × 2/√3 (25.Millman B.M. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 359-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) (d1,0 lattice spacing of rat slack myocardium is 43 nm; see Ref. 26.Irving T.C. Konhilas J. Perry D. Fischetti R. de Tombe P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2568-H2573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we assumed that there are 6 titin molecules/half-thick filament (27.Cazorla O. Freiburg A. Helmes M. Centner T. McNabb M. Wu Y. Trombitas K. Labeit S. Granzier H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 28.Liversage A.D. Holmes D. Knight P.J. Tskhovrebova L. Trinick J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Accordingly, there are 2.31 × 106 titin molecules/mm2 of cell cross-sectional area, and this value was used to convert measured passive tensions (5.Helmes M. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kellermayer M. Labeit S. Linke W.A. Granzier H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1339-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) to passive force per single titin molecule (see Fig. 6D). To obtain the measured extensions of tandem Ig segments, the PEVK domain, and N2B-Us, we used the results of our earlier immunoelectron microscopic studies on N2B-expressing cardiac myocytes (6.Trombitas K. Freiburg A. Centner T. Labeit S. Granzier H. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3189-3196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 29.Trombitas K. Redkar A. Centner T. Wu Y. Labeit S. Granzier H. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 3226-3234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal end of the distal tandem Ig segment was determined with the MIR antibody, which does not exactly label the C-terminal end (6.Trombitas K. Freiburg A. Centner T. Labeit S. Granzier H. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3189-3196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we adjusted the measurements assuming that a native domain (Ig or fibronectin-type 3) contributes 4.5 nm to the contour length. The measured extension-sarcomere length data were segregated in sarcomere length bins of 0.05 μm, and mean values ± S.E. were then calculated (see Fig. 6C). We used the following programs: PELE and GOR4, 5Both available at workbench.sdsc.edu. nnPredict, 6Available at www.expasy.org. and PONDR (Predictor of NaturalDisorderedProteins). 7Available at www.pondr.com (42.Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E. Brown C. Dunker A.K. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Gen. 2001; 42: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). To study the mechanical properties of the cardiac PEVK domain (N2B isoform) and N2B-Us, we used recombinant fragments containing the 572-residue N2B-Us or the 188-residue PEVK domain along with its flanking Ig domains I27 and I84 (Fig. 1). Force-extension curves were measured using an AFM (molecular force probe) specialized for stretching individual molecules (Fig. 2A). Because our goal was to determine the persistence lengths of single PEVK and N2B-Us molecules, we optimized the likelihood of stretching single molecules using protein concentrations that were so low that, during continuous probing of the surface with the AFM, only few contacts were made. Furthermore, we also studied poly-Ig fragments (I65–70 and I91–98 from the proximal and distal tandem Ig segments, respectively) because they display force sawteeth, with a spacing that is likely to be regular when pulling single molecules and irregular when pulling multiple molecules in parallel (30.Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fisher T.E. Marszalek P.E. Li H. Fernandez J.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 63-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and explored how stretching multiple molecules affects the persistence length. An example of a stretch-release curve of I91–98 is shown in Fig. 2B. The stretch curve displays sawtooth-like force peaks, indicating that repetitive structural transitions occurred during stretching, with each sudden force drop representing the unfolding of a β-barrel Ig domain. At a stretch rate of 0.5 μm/s, the mean unfolding force was ∼230 pN, consistent with the reported high stability of Ig domains (31.Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The curve in Fig. 2B is from an experiment in which the force peaks were regularly spaced (average spacing was ∼28 nm), whereas, on occasion, irregularly spaced peaks were obtained, an example of which is shown in Fig. 2C. We determined the persistence length of unfolded Ig domains by analyzing the release data of stretch-release curves. The data were segregated into two groups: (i) data containing stretch curves with regularly spaced force sawteeth (as in Fig. 2B) and (ii) data containing stretch curves with irregularly spaced force sawteeth (as in Fig. 2C). We found that the persistence length distribution from data with regularly spaced force sawteeth had a major peak at ∼0.6 nm (Fig. 2D, shaded bars)."

However, the mechanism underlying PS-mediated γ-cleavage remains unclear. We have identified Herp cDNA by our newly developed screening method for the isolation of cDNAs that increase the degree of γ-cleavage. Herp was originally identified as a homocysteine-responsive protein, and its expression is up-regulated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. Herp is an endoplasmic reticulum-localized membrane protein that has a ubiquitin-like domain. Here, we report that a high expression of Herp in cells increases the level of Aβ generation, although not in PS-deficient cells. We found that Herp interacts with both PS1 and PS2. Thus, Herp regulates PS-mediated Aβ generation, possibly through its binding to PS. Immunohistochemical analysis of a normal human brain section with an anti-Herp antibody revealed the exclusive staining of neurons and vascular smooth muscle cells. Moreover, the antibody strongly stained activated microglia in senile plaques in the brain of patients with Alzheimer disease. Taken together, Herp could be involved in Aβ accumulation, including the formation of senile plaques and vascular Aβ deposits.

Recently, ErbB4 has been found to be another natural substrate of the PS-mediated intramembranous proteolysis (9.Lee H.J. Jung K.M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.W. J. Biol.

Interestingly, although the γ-cleavage of APP is a critical step toward the production of Aβ, the major intramembranous cleavage site of APP was found to be distinct from the γ-cleavage site (10.Gu Y.

The mechanism underlying PS-mediated intramembranous proteolysis including γ-cleavage remains to be clarified. To date, a number of PS-interacting proteins have been identified, but no natural interactors with PS have been found to modulate Aβ generation, although some mutant forms of nicastrin, which was identified as a component of the PS complex, increase Aβ production (12.Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E.

To elucidate the mechanism underlying the PS-mediated γ-cleavage, we have recently developed a new functional screening method for identifying cDNAs that increase the degree of γ-cleavage using a combination of γ-cleavage-dependent puromycin-resistant assay and Aβ quantitation (see “Experimental Procedures”; the details of this screening method will be described elsewhere). Using this method, we have identified Herp, which was originally identified as a homocysteine-induced protein (13.Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Interestingly, elevated levels of homocysteine are correlated with multiple neurological disorders (14.Clarke R. Smith A.D. Jobst K.A. Refsum H. Sutton L. Ueland P.M. Arch.

Plasma homocysteine levels have been reported to be elevated in some cases of AD (16.Miller J.W. Nutr. Rev. 1999; 57: 126-129PubMed Google Scholar) and could be an early marker of cognitive impairment in the elderly (17.Lehmann M. Gottfries C.G. Regland B. Dement. Geriatr. Cogn. Disord. 1999; 10: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Herp mRNA is constitutively expressed in various tissues, but its expression is up-regulated by homocysteine or the inducers of ER stress such as 2-mercaptoethanol, A23187, and thapsigargin (13.Kokame K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9199-9205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Herp is a membrane protein localized in the ER, and it has an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain; the function of this protein, however, is not known (13.Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In contrast to ER stress-induced molecular chaperones including BiP and GRP94 in the ER lumen, a major portion of Herp molecules are present in the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane (13.Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Herp may have a role distinct from that of molecular chaperones under ER stress. Here, we show that Herp enhances PS-mediated Aβ generation and that it interacts with PS. We designed a functional screening system for isolating cDNAs that increase the degree of γ-cleavage as follows. (The details of the screening system will be described elsewhere.) 2H. Komano, Y. Kawamura, H. Shiraishi, X. Sai, R. Suzuki, M. Kawaichi, T. Kitamur, and K. Yanagisawa, unpublished data. We established a cell line (designated as A5–9), BaF/3 cells (19.Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp.

BaF/3 cells do not express endogenous APP. 3H. Komano and K. Yanagisawa, unpublished data. To initiate screening, a human hippocampus-derived cDNA library in a retroviral vector, pMX, was infected into A5–9 cells as reported previously (19.Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A.

The infected A5–9 cells were treated with a lethal dose of puromycin. The level of Aβ40 secreted from surviving clones was measured using a highly sensitive immunoblotting method. The cDNAs from surviving clones expressing a higher level of Aβ40 as compared with that of parental cells were extracted and amplified by PCR using vector primers. One of these encoded Herp lacking Gln76–Lys100. Since we did not know whether this Herp variant is a natural form or a PCR artifact product, we recloned a previously reported Herp cDNA (13.Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) into pcDNA3.1 or pMX. The effect of the Herp cDNA on Aβ generation from the full-length APP was then tested using HEK293 cells stably expressing APP. By the PCR method, we generated a chimeral cDNA encoding C53NICD that consists of the first Met plus the Asp596–Leu648fragment of APP695 (C100 (N-terminal truncated APP starting at the β-secretase site) lacking the intracellular domain) and the C-terminal intracellular domain (from Ser1745 to the C terminus) of mouse Notch-1. This chimeral cDNA was inserted into pCxN (21.Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar) and designated as pCxN-C53NICD. A plasmid named pHES1-pac, which contains a puromycin-resistant gene (pac) driven by the HES1 promoter (a DNA element responsible for Notch-dependent gene expression) (22.Takebayashi K. Sasai Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was constructed as follows: (i) The HES1 promoter isolated by the PCR method from the mouse genomic library was inserted into a vector, PGV-B (TOYO B-Net Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). This plasmid was designated as PGV-B-HES-1. (ii) pac of pPUR (CLONTECH) was inserted into PGV-B-HES-1. The final plasmid was designated as pHES-pac. We ensured that the cells expressing C53NICD, as well as the cells expressing APP, generate Aβ40 and Aβ42. We also confirmed that the expression of C53NICD in the cells induced the expression of the luciferase gene driven by the HES1 promoter. The retrovirus-mediated infection was carried out as reported previously (20.Xu X. Leo C. Jang Y. Chan E. Padilla D. Huang B.C. Lin T. Gururaja T. Hitoshi Y. Lorens J.B. Anderson D.C. Sikic B. Luo Y.

(Temecula, CA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. A monoclonal antibody 6E10 specific to human Aβ1–17 was purchased from Senetek (St. Louis, MO). BA27 specific for the Aβ40 terminal site, BC05 specific for the Aβ42 terminal site, BAN50 raised against Aβ1–6, and BNT77 raised against human Aβ11–28 have all been characterized previously (25.Asami-Odaka A.

Affinity-purified rabbit antibody 369 was raised against the C-terminal residues of APP695 (26.Buxbaum J.D. Gandy S.E. Cicchetti P. Ehrlich M.E. Czernik A.J. Fracasso R.P. Ramabhadran T.V. Unterbeck A.J. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6003-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit antibody B12/4 was raised against 20 C-terminal amino acid residues of APP695 (27.De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cultured cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris/HCl pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2% sodium deoxycholate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. The solubilized proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (28.Sudoh S. Kawamura Y. Sato S. Wang R. Saido T.C. Oyama F. Sakaki Y. Komano H. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1535-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gel for the detection of PS and Herp and on 7.5% gel for the detection of intracellular APP. Immunoblotting was performed as reported previously (28.Sudoh S. Kawamura Y. Sato S. Wang R. Saido T.C. Oyama F. Sakaki Y. Komano H. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1535-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The secreted Aβ was immunoprecipitated and detected using a highly sensitive immunoblotting technique as described previously (28.Sudoh S. Kawamura Y. Sato S. Wang R. Saido T.C. Oyama F. Sakaki Y. Komano H. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1535-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Intracellular C99 was immunoprecipitated with BAN50 and detected using a highly sensitive immunoblotting technique with B12/4. ELISA for Aβ was performed as described previously (25.Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The capture antibody used was BNT77. Detector antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BA27 (for Aβ40) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BC05 (for Aβ42). ELISA data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using StatView-J.4.11. Acetone-fixed cryostat sections or Kryofix-fixed, paraffin-embedded serial sections were prepared from five nondemented and five AD brains. Cryostat sections were used only for the staining of neurons with the anti-Herp antibody since the staining signals were weak in ordinary formalin-paraffin sections. Tissue sections were blocked with 5% normal goat (for anti-Herp antibody) or horse (for anti-HLA-DP, DQ, and DR antibody) serum and then reacted with the anti-Herp antibody (5 μg/ml) or the anti-HLA-DP, DQ, and DR (major histocompatibility complex class II antigen, 3 μg/ml; DAKO, CR3/43) antibody followed by biotinylated secondary antibodies. Positive signals were visualized by incubating the sections in a diaminobenzidine-H2O2solution. For the double immunofluorescent study, after pretreatment with 0.1% Sudan black B in 70% ethanol for 7 min to mask autofluorescence, Kryofix paraffin sections were reacted with a primary antibody mixture (anti-Herp, 5 μg/ml and anti-Aβ, 4G8, monoclonal, 1:1,000) and then reacted with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (40 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (20 μg/ml, Jackson). For the control study, anti-Herp antibody was preabsorbed with 10-fold by weight of recombinant Herp. We first investigated whether transfection of Herp cDNA increases the extent of Aβ generation from full-length APP using HEK293 cells stably expressing APP. We found that a stably high expression level of Herp increased the extent of Aβ40 generation (Fig. 1a). Statistical analysis of ELISA results using the cells stably expressing Herp showed that the increase in the Aβ40 level caused by the high expression of Herp was ∼1.8-fold (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the effect of Herp on the Aβ42 level was not significant (Fig. 1b). We next tested whether an increase in the level of Aβ generation by Herp expression can occur in PS-deficient cells since it is not conclusive yet whether PS itself is a γ-secretase. As shown in Fig. 1c, no Aβ was detected in PS-deficient fibroblasts expressing Herp, whereas Herp expression in wild-type fibroblasts increased the Aβ level. We also confirmed that the intracellular APP level was not changed by the high expression level of Herp (Fig. 1c). These results indicate that Herp enhances PS-mediated Aβ40 generation. In addition, the level of intracellular β-secretase-cleaved C-terminal APP fragment (C99) was significantly reduced by Herp transfection, whereas the level of soluble α-secretase-cleaved N-terminal APP fragment (α-APPs) was not changed (Fig. 1d). These results strongly suggest that Herp preferentially increases a degree of γ-secretase cleavage. Since both PS and Herp reside in the ER, it is likely that Herp interacts with PS, resulting in an increase in the extent of Aβ generation. Therefore, we next investigated the interaction of PS with Herp by coimmunoprecipitation studies using HEK293 cells stably expressing PS1 plus APP. An anti-PS1 antibody coimmunoprecipitated with Herp (Fig. 2a). The level of the coimmunoprecipitated Herp was approximately equivalent to that of Herp contained in the 10% starting lysate used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2a). Considering that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation by the anti-PS1 antibody is about 10% (data not shown), it is likely that almost the entire amount of Herp interacts with PS1. PS undergoes endoproteolysis, forming N- and C-terminal fragments (29.Haass C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an anti-Herp antibody immunoprecipitated the full-length PS1, but it only immunoprecipitated a small amount of the N-terminal fragment of PS1 (Fig. 2b). These results indicate that Herp mainly interacts with the full-length PS1. The study of PS2 and Herp interaction was also performed using HEK293 cells that transiently expressed PS2 and FLAG-epitope-tagged Herp. As shown in Fig. 2c, full-length PS2 coprecipitated with FLAG-epitope-tagged Herp. Thus, Herp interacts with both PS1 and PS2, and the major PS molecule that interacts with Herp was the full-length PS. The expression of Herp did not alter the steady-state levels of full-length PS and N-terminal fragment (Fig. 2, b and d), suggesting that Herp does not enhance the endoproteolysis of PS. APP and Herp interaction was also studied. Herp only coprecipitated APP at less than 1% of the total APP in the cells (data not shown). Therefore, in all probability, APP does not specifically interact with Herp. Thus, it is likely that the direct interaction of the full-length PS with Herp causes an increase in the degree of PS-mediated γ-cleavage of APP. Alternatively, at present, we cannot exclude the possibility that Herp indirectly affects the Aβ level, for example, by regulating the intracellular calcium level, since it was suggested that the intracellular calcium level modifies the Aβ level (30.Querfurth H.W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4550-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Herp expression is up-regulated by calcium ionophores (13.Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and Herp may potentially regulate the intracellular calcium level. Immunohistochemical analysis of Herp in a human brain section was performed to identify the cell types expressing a high level of Herp in the brain; these cells are considered to generate a high level of Aβ. As shown in Fig. 3a, only neurons were positive for Herp in the parenchyma cerebral cortex of a nondemented human brain. Interestingly, microglia in senile plaques in the brain of AD patients were strongly stained (Fig. 3b). The staining of HLA-DP, DQ, and DR (markers of activated microglia (31.Itagaki S. McGeer P.L. Akiyama H. Zhu S. Selkoe D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1989; 24: 173-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar)) and Herp in serial sections (Fig. 3c) indicates that some of the activated microglia in the center of senile plaques are highly immunoreactive with the anti-Herp antibody. Double immunostaining with anti-Herp and anti-HLA-DP, DQ, and DR antibodies also confirmed that activated microglia are strongly positive for Herp (see supplemental data). In addition, smooth muscle cells in meningeal arteries and arterioles were strongly stained (Fig. 3d). One hallmark of AD is the accumulation of Aβ, although the cause of AD may be multifactorial. Here, we showed that ER stress-inducible Herp enhances Aβ40 generation. Since a significant increase in the level of Aβ42 was not observed, the high expression level of Herp appears to mainly enhance 40-γ-secretase cleavage. A recent report showed that some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs preferentially decreased the generation of Aβ42 (32.Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Taken together with our result, it appears that the regulation of the generation of Aβ42 is distinct from that of Aβ40, even though the generation of both Aβ forms requires PS. Herp was originally discovered as a homocysteine-induced protein. It is noteworthy that a high plasma homocysteine level was observed in some cases of AD (14.Clarke R. Smith A.D. Jobst K.A. Refsum H. Sutton L. Ueland P.M. Arch. Neurol. 1998; 55: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). At present, we cannot determine whether Herp directly or indirectly activates γ-secretase. We have shown that Herp interacts with the full-length PS rather than with its endoproteolytic products. A transient overexpression of Herp did not enhance the endoproteolytic cleavage of PS nor change the PS level. Since endoproteolytic cleavage of PS is not essential for the biological function of PS or Aβ generation (34.Saura C.A. Tomita T. Soriano S. Takahashi M. Leem J.Y. Honda T. Koo E.H. Iwatsubo T. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17136-17142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), one interpretation for the enhancement of Aβ generation caused by Herp expression is that Herp directly activates the full-length PS-mediated γ-activity by binding to the full-length PS, possibly through a change in the conformation or the trafficking of PS. The physical interaction of Herp with PS also raises the possibility that the function of PS is modulated by ER stress through Herp expressed at high levels. It was reported that cells exposed to inducers of ER stress, such as calcium ionophore, A23187, or thapsigargin, have increased the extracellular Aβ level, suggesting that the intracellular calcium level regulates Aβ generation (30.Querfurth H.W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4550-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Taken together with our results, it is most likely that these inducers cause a Herp-mediated increase in the Aβ level since these inducers strongly up-regulate Herp expression. Our present study showed that, in the normal brain, Herp was expressed in neurons and highly expressed in vascular cells, suggesting that these cells are the major source of Aβ in the normal brain. Interestingly, Herp expression was up-regulated in activated microglia in senile plaques in the AD brain. Activated microglia are thought to play a role in the clearance of Aβ. However, some activated microglia, which strongly express Herp, may generate a high level of Aβ and function in the formation of Aβ deposits. Vascular Aβ deposits known as amyloid angiopathy are also one of the major signs of AD pathology (4.Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 33.Yamada M. Neuropathology. 2000; 20: 8-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The high expression level of Herp in vascular cells may be related to amyloid angiopathy. The cells expressing Herp at high levels could contribute to Aβ accumulation, including the formation of senile plaques or vascular Aβ deposits, in patients with AD. In particular, it is interesting that Herp has an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain. Several proteins were reported to have a ubiquitin-like domain in eukaryotic cells, but the biological significance of this domain still remains to be clarified. In some cases, such as ubiquitin itself, a ubiquitin-related domain is involved in targeting proteins for protein degradation (35.Kawakami T. Chiba T. Suzuki T. Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Minato N. Suzuki H. Shimbara N. Hidaka Y. Osaka F. Omata M. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4003-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), but other functions such as chaperon function or protein-protein interaction were also reported (36.Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Presenilin undergoes degradation via the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway (29.Haass C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the steady-state level of PS in cells expressing Herp was not changed as compared with that in nontransfected cells, strongly suggesting that the high expression level of Herp is not involved in the degradation of PS. Mutations in the PARKIN gene were discovered in families with an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson disease (37.Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4199) Google Scholar). Parkin also has the ubiquitin-like domain in the N-terminal site, although the function of the domain is not known, and it is up-regulated by ER stress (38.Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 39.Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that parkin is involved in the ubiquitination of Pael receptor and α-synuclein (39.Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 40.Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Since a strong ubiquitin immunoreactivity is associated with the pathology of both AD and Parkinson disease, the complex of presenilin and Herp with a ubiquitin-like domain may also function in the elimination of misfolded proteins via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway as parkin does. Further exploration of the biological significance of the interaction of Herp with PS will not only help determine the pathways by which γ-secretase activity is regulated by PS but may also further clarify the role of PS under ER stress or in AD pathogenesis.

Using a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify potential coregulators of Pax5, we identified Daxx, a protein that is highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed, and essential for embryonic mouse development. The interaction between Pax5 and Daxx involves the partial homeodomain of Pax5 and the C-terminal fragment of Daxx. A component of promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies, Daxx has been implicated in apoptosis and characterized as a transcriptional corepressor. Upon transient transfection assay of Daxx in B cells expressing endogenous Daxx and Pax5, we observed not only transcriptional corepression but also, unexpectedly, coactivation in M12.4.1 and A20 mouse B cell lines. Pax5 domains required for coactivation were identified using 293T cells. Coactivation apparently involves recruitment of the CREB binding protein (CBP), because we precipitated complexes containing Pax5, Daxx, and CBP in B cell lines. These data suggest that Daxx can affect Pax5's roles as an activator or repressor in B cells and describe a role for Daxx as a transcriptional coactivator.

These data suggest that Daxx can affect Pax5's roles as an activator or repressor in B cells and describe a role for Daxx as a transcriptional coactivator. The transcription factor Pax5 (BSAP) is essential for the development of B cells in mice (1.Urbánek P. Wang Z.-Q. Fetka I. Wagner E.F. Busslinger M. Cell. 1994; 79: 901-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In Pax5-deficient mice, fetal B cells are completely absent, and B cell development in the bone marrow fails to progress past the early pro-B (pre-BI) stage (2.Nutt S.L. Thevenin C. Busslinger M. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Pre-BI precursor cells from Pax5-deficient mice, but not from wild type mice, can give rise to a number of non-B cell hematopoietic lineages, in vitro and in vivo, including T lymphocytes and myeloid cell types, (3.Nutt S.L. Heavey B. Rolink A.G. Busslinger M. Nature. 1999; 401: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 4.Rolink A.G. Nutt S.L. Melchers F. Busslinger M. Nature. 1999; 401: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been shown that pre-BI Pax5-deficient cells express a number of cytokine receptors (3.Nutt S.L. Heavey B. Rolink A.G. Busslinger M. Nature. 1999; 401: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Pax5, therefore, appears to activate progression of early precursors to the B cell lineage and away from T cell and myeloid cell types. Introduction of wild type Pax5 into Pax5-deficient pre-BI cells rescues B cell differentiation and executes dramatically opposite effects on various genes;e.g. the myeloid M-CSF receptor and PD-1 genes are down-regulated whereas CD19, N-myc, mb-1, and LEF-1 are up-regulated (3.Nutt S.L. Heavey B. Rolink A.G. Busslinger M. Nature. 1999; 401: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 5.Nutt S.L. Morrison A.M. Dorfler P. Rolink A. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2319-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only the N-terminal paired domain of Pax5 is required for activation of mb-1 and LEF-1 (5.Nutt S.L. Morrison A.M. Dorfler P. Rolink A. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2319-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition to its role early in B cell differentiation, Pax5 is essential for later stages as well, when it influences the expression of many genes (6.Horcher M. Souabni A. Busslinger M. Immunity. 2001; 14: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We and others (7.Singh M. Birshtein B.K. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 730-742PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Pax5 is a transcriptional activator or repressor for the 3′-immuno-globulin heavy chain gene (Igh) enhancer and other targets (reviewed in Ref. 9.Hagman J.

To identify potential coregulators of Pax5, we have used a yeast two-hybrid assay. Previously, we reported the interaction of Pax5 with importin α1 (15.Kovac C.R. Emelyanov A. Singh M. Ashouian N.

We have observed coactivation of Pax5 by Daxx in mature B cell lines that express Pax5, putatively through interaction with the CREB-binding protein, CBP, which has HAT activity. We also observed an inhibitory effect of Daxx on Pax5's transcriptional activity in HS-Sultan lymphoblastoid cells and J558L plasma cells. Together, these data suggest that Daxx is a bridge protein that helps Pax5 to function as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor during B cell differentiation. glutathione S-transferase promyelocytic leukemia protein CREB binding protein amino acid(s) DNA binding domain dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride cytomegalovirus Rous sarcoma virus nuclear localization signal histone acetyltransferase forkhead 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside immunoglobulin heavy chain histone deacetylase The serine/threonine-rich central domain of Pax5 (aa 144–267) (GenBankTM accession number M97013 for murine Pax5 and M96944 for human Pax5) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay, performed as described previously (15.Kovac C.R.

A cDNA library from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human peripheral B cells cloned in the pACT vector (a gift from Dr. S.

Candidate clones were also assayed in an O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside liquid assay (35.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

The Pax5 mammalian expression construct was generated by cloning NotI-linked murine Pax5 cDNA from pBSK-Pax5 (a gift from Dr. Stephen Desiderio, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) into the pEBB vector (a modified version of pEF-BOS (36.Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar)). Pax5ΔPDPax5ΔHD, and Pax5ΔC mammalian expression constructs were prepared by cloning PCR amplified fragments from pBSK-Pax5 into ClaI-NotI sites of pEBB. The Pax5ΔHD construct was generated by ligating PCR-amplified fragments, aa 1–228 and aa 254–391, at an XhoI site introduced at the deletion site but without affecting the amino acid sequence.

Barrett J. Villa-Garcia M. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5914-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).

These constructs were prepared by cloning fragments of murine Pax5 cDNA amplified by PCR from pBSK-Pax5 into EcoRI-SalI sites of the pGEX-5X vector (Promega). Primers used for amplification were the same as those used for creating green fluorescence protein fusion Pax5 constructs, as described previously (15.Kovac C.R. Emelyanov A. Singh M. Ashouian N. Birshtein B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16752-16757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These were the same as used previously elsewhere (15.Kovac C.R. Emelyanov A.

Daxx mammalian expression constructs were prepared by cloning full-length human Daxx cDNA from pEQ30-Daxx (a gift from Dr. Jerome Strauss, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA) into BamHI-NotI sites of pEBB. The GAL4DBD-Daxx construct was prepared by cloning full-length human Daxx cDNA into BamHI-SalI sites of pGALO. The murine Daxx mammalian expression vector (24.Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. Xiaolu Yang (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). PCR-amplified fragments of human Daxx cDNA (Fig. 4A) were cloned in frame into BamHI-SalI sites of pGEX-5X vector (Promega). Primers are as follows: pGEX-1F, TAATGGATCCATATGGCCACCGCTAACAGCATCATC; pGEX-240F, TAATGGATCCATAAAGACTGCTCTTCACTGACC; pGEX-502F, TAATGGATCCATCAGATTTCCAATGAAAAGAAA; pGEX-626F, TAATGGATCCATTCTGGTCCCCCCTGCAAAAAA; pGEX-239R, TAATGTCGACCAGCTCACATAGTCGCCCAAA; pGEX-501R, TAATGTCGACTAGTGAGGACATGGGGCTCTT; pGEX-625R, TAATGTCGACATCTCCCCAGTTGTGAGGAGA; pGEX-740R, TAATGTCGACCTAATCAGAGTCTGAGAGGATGAT. All constructs listed here were verified by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing and were shown by Western blot analysis to express equivalent levels of protein in 293T cells prior to reporter assays. Purified GST fusion proteins (2–5 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 20 μl of reaction mix, which contained [35S]methionine-labeled proteins in vitrosynthesized by a coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm DTT), supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml of leupeptin and pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. For in vitro translation, full-length murine Pax5 cDNA and human Daxx cDNA were cloned into pSP72 vector (Promega). After incubation, beads were washed five times with binding buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted and detected by autoradiography after separation by 10% SDS-PAGE. The human kidney cell line 293T and HeLa were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The murine B cell lines M12.4.1 and A20, and the human lymphoblastoid cell lines BL(Burkitt's lymphoma)-2 and HS-Sultan were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Fisher). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Goat anti-Pax5 antibody (N-19), which is directed against the N terminus of Pax5, rabbit anti-Daxx (M-112) antibody, rabbit anti-CBP antibody (A22), and normal rabbit IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). We also used a custom polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against amino acids 144–391 of Pax5 (Covance). 293T cells were transiently transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells (2–3 × 106) were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT) with protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Precleared lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with goat anti-Pax5 antibody. Immunocomplexes were collected by addition of 20 μl of protein G-agarose (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the beads with lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. The pGL3(CD19-2) luciferase reporter construct, a gift from Dr. James Hagman (National Jewish Hospital, Boulder, CO), contains four tandem copies of a low affinity Pax5 binding site from the human CD19 promoter (5′-TCGACTGGGGCCTGAGGCGTGACC-3′) inserted at the XhoI site of the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega) upstream of the SV40 promoter. We carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis using nuclear extracts from B cell lines to confirm that Pax5 binding to this reporter region could be detected. (UAS)5E1bTATA Luc (designated as E1bLuc) and (UAS)5TK Luc (designated as TKLuc) reporter constructs were gifts from Dr. Richard Pestell (Albert Einstein College of Medicine) and are described elsewhere (38.Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Lastowiecki P. Zon L. Ostrowski M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1084-1094PubMed Google Scholar). The RSV-CBP expression construct, which contains human CBP cDNA, was a gift of Dr. Richard Kitsis (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). The pcDNA3.1-p300 construct, which encodes human p300, was a gift of Drs. Nickolai Barlev and Shelley Berger from the Wistar Institute. For reporter assays, HeLa cells and 293T cells were transfected with reporter constructs, Pax5 and Daxx expression vectors, and RSV-β-gal by the Geneporter reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A dextran method was used for transfection of M12.4.1 and A20 cells, as previously described (7.Singh M. Birshtein B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3611-3622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Michaelson J.S. Singh M. Snapper C.M. Sha W.C. Baltimore D. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2828-2839PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h, cell extracts were analyzed with a luciferase assay kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Transfection efficiency was normalized by assay of β-galactosidase activity using a Galacto-Light plus kit (Tropix). HS-Sultan cells were transiently transfected by electroporation. 5 × 106 cells in 0.8 ml of complete media were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then electroporated at 960 microfarads/280 V. The Renillaluciferase expression vector pRL-CMV (Promega) was cotransfected for normalization. After 24 h, cells were harvested and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in the cell extracts were measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The total amount of DNA (20–22 μg) was adjusted by addition of pEBB with no insert. All readings were taken using an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (EG&G Berthold). Each experiment was performed at least three times, and within each experiment, transfections were performed in triplicate, except for M12.4.1 and A20, which were performed in duplicate. The average of the relative luciferase activity for each experiment was divided by the relative basal reporter luciferase activity, and the calculated average is shown as -fold transactivation with standard deviation. A20 (6–8 × 107), M12.4.1 (6–8 × 107), 293T (1–2 × 106), and 1 × 108 BL-2 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation mild buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) with protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 1 h on ice. Precleared lysates (2 mg of total protein) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with rabbit normal IgG or rabbit anti-Daxx antibody, or, also for BL-2, rabbit anti-Pax5 or rabbit anti-CBP antibody, together with 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Sigma). After extensive washing with lysis buffer, immunocomplexes were incubated in 50 μl of HAT assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 4 μg of free histones (Sigma), and 125 nCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by spotting supernatants on P81 paper filters (Whatman), which were washed 3× in 50 mmcarbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0), and counted in a scintillation counter, LS 6800 (Beckman). Immunocomplexes, prepared as described above from A20, M12.4.1, and 293T cells, were eluted from beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation by antibody to CBP, Pax5, or Daxx with extracts from BL-2 cells was performed in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml EtBr (41.Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The central domain of Pax5 (aa 144–267) was used to screen a library of 106 yeast colonies containing human B cell cDNA in the yeast two-hybrid assay, and we detected one clone (isolated four times) containing human Daxx (GenBankTM accession number AFO15956) (see Fig. 1). This clone extended from bp 417 to bp 2463, coding for aa 139 through the C terminus at aa 740. Assay of truncation mutants of the Pax5 bait region (Fig. 2) showed that interaction with Daxx required the partial homeodomain but neither the octapeptide nor NLS sequences. We observed a potential weak interaction of the paired domain of Pax5 with Daxx. Human and mouse Pax5 are identical except for three amino acid residues, none of which affects the region used as bait in the two-hybrid assay (42.Adams B. Dorfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Human (AF15956) and mouse (AF006040) Daxx show 69% similarity (22.Kiriakidou M. Driscoll D.A. Lopez-Guisa J.M. Strauss 3rd, J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1289-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although most experiments were done with human Daxx, mouse Daxx, as described below, appears to act similarly. We used a GST pull-down assay to examine the physical interaction between different Pax5 truncation mutants and full-length human Daxx (Fig. 3). Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid assay, GST-Pax5 fusion proteins that contained the partial homeodomain (the shortest of which was aa 202–254) were able to bind to Daxx. However, there was no detectable interaction of the paired domain (aa 16–143) of Pax5 with Daxx, suggesting that the weak interaction observed in the yeast two-hybrid system may not be specific. Analysis of GST fusion proteins that contain different segments of human Daxx (Fig. 4) showed that only the C-terminal segment of human Daxx (aa 626–740) was able to interact with Pax5, the same region that has been shown to interact with Fas (24.Yang X.

Commun. 2000; 279: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been problematic to study the transcriptional activity of Pax5 using reporter constructs. For example, the expression of the CD19 gene is clearly linked to Pax5 expression and sequences upstream of the CD19 promoter contain two Pax5 binding sites (45.Kozmik Z. Wang S. Dörfler P. Adams B. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2662-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, reporter constructs utilizing this 5′ upstream region have been ineffective in measuring Pax5-dependent activity in transient transfection assays in B cells (45.Kozmik Z. Wang S. Dörfler P. Adams B. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2662-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 46.Riva A. Wilson G.L. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1284-1292PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, measurements of Pax5-dependent transcriptional activity in non-B cells have also been difficult to achieve (12.Lauring J. Schlissel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2601-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 42.Adams B. Dorfler P. Aguzzi A. Kozmik Z. Urbanek P. Maurer-Fogy I. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1589-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). However, excised Pax5 binding sites have been successfully used for reporter assays measuring Pax5 transcriptional activity (e.g. Refs. 13.Maitra S. Atchison M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 46.Riva A. Wilson G.L. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1284-1292PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Dorfler P. Busslinger M.

We tested the ability of Daxx to modulate Pax5 function in B cell lines by using the reporter, pGL3(CD19-2), which was generated by the introduction of multimerized low affinity Pax5 binding sites from the CD19 promoter to a position upstream of the SV40 promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). In M12.4.1 and A20 murine B cells, and in HS-Sultan human cells, each of which expresses endogenous Pax5, there was more activity with pGL3(CD19-2) than with the basic reporter (pGL3), presumably reflecting the activation effect of endogenous Pax5 (see Fig. 5, A–C, compare lanes 1 and 3). Although the expression of Daxx upon transfection had no effect on reporter activity of pGL3, which lacks Pax5 binding sites (Fig. 5A–C, comp"
https://openalex.org/W2042662424,"Aberrant centrosome duplication is observed in many tumor cells and may contribute to genomic instability through the formation of multipolar mitotic spindles. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) is required for multiple rounds of centrosome duplication in Xenopus egg extracts but not for the initial round of replication. Egg extracts undergo periodic oscillations in the level of free calcium. We show here that chelation of calcium in egg extracts or specific inactivation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) blocks even initial centrosome duplication, whereas inactivation of Cdk2 does not. Duplication can be restored to inhibited extracts by addition of CaMKII and calmodulin. These results indicate that calcium, calmodulin, and CaMKII are required for an essential step in initiation of centrosome duplication. Our data suggest that calcium oscillations in the cell cycle may be linked to centrosome duplication."
https://openalex.org/W1964232961,"How does the high selectivity to stimulus orientation emerge in the visual cortex? Thalamic feedforward-dominated models of orientation selectivity predict constant selectivity during the visual response, whereas intracortical recurrent models predict dynamic improvement in selectivity. We imaged the cat visual cortex with voltage-sensitive dyes to measure orientation-tuning dynamics of a large neuronal population. Tuning-curve width did not narrow after response onset, whereas the difference between preferred and orthogonal responses (modulation depth) first increased, then declined. We identified a suppression of the evoked responses, referred to as the evoked deceleration-acceleration (DA) notch, which was larger for the orthogonal response. Furthermore, peak selectivity of the tuning curves was contemporaneous with the evoked DA notch. These findings suggest that in the cat brain, sustained visual cortical processing does not narrow orientation tuning; rather, intracortical interactions may amplify modulation depth and suppress the orthogonal response relatively more than the preferred. Thus, feedforward models and recurrent models of orientation selectivity must be combined."
https://openalex.org/W1977584362,"Class IX myosins are unique among the many classes of known actin-based motors in that the tail region of these myosins contains a GTPase-activating protein domain for the small GTP-binding protein, Rho. Previous studies on human myosin-IXb indicate that this myosin is mechanochemically active and exhibits actin-binding properties similar to the processive motor, myosin-Va. Motility analysis of antibody-tethered myosin-IXb performed using the sliding actin filament assay indicates that this myosin does exhibit properties characteristic of a processive motor. Like myosin-Va, the velocity of myosin-IXb remains constant (38.2 ± 1.2 nm/s) even at single motor/filament densities. At low motor densities, filaments can be seen passing through and pivoting about single points on the motility surface. Analysis of filament landing rates as a function of motor density also indicates that a single motor is sufficient for filament movement. However, in contrast to myosin-Va, which uses coordinated motion of its two heads to move processively along the filament, hydrodynamic and chemical cross-linking studies indicate that under the conditions tested, myosin-IXb is a single-headed motor consisting of a single heavy chain and associated light chains.

Acta. 2000; 1496: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The hallmark structural feature of these myosins with respect to their function is within the tail domain: a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) 1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinCaMcalmodulin 1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinCaMcalmodulin domain structurally homologous to GAPs for the Rho family of G proteins. Biochemical characterizations of both bacterially expressed Myr 5 and Myr 7 tail domains and tissue-purified human Myo9b demonstrate that these myosins IX are active GAPs for Rho but not Rac or CDC 42 (3, 4, 7). Moreover, overexpression of both Myr 5 and Myr 7 in cultured cells results in inactivation of Rho in these cells (4.Chieregatti E. Gartner A. Stoffler H.E. Bahler M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3597-3608PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Muller R.T. Honnert U. Reinhard J. Bahler M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2039-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike proposed cargo-carrying functions for most other myosins, class IX myosins may be their own cargo, with the motor domain carrying its Rho-GAP tail to sites that require down-regulation of Rho-dependent signaling (1.Bahler M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9.Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). GTPase-activating protein calmodulin GTPase-activating protein calmodulin The motor domain of class IX myosins also contains distinctive features compared with other myosins. This includes an N-terminal extension that is structurally homologous to a Ras binding domain, although expressed fusion protein containing this domain from Myr 5 lacks Ras binding activity (10.Kalhammer G. Bahler M. Schmitz F. Jockel J. Block C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Relative to other myosins, the motor domain also contains a large (∼140 amino acids in Myo9b) highly basic insertion at the presumed site of actin contact (referred to as surface loop two in the atomic structure of the motor domain of myosin-II (11.Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar)). Between the motor and tail domain is a neck domain consisting of four IQ light chain-binding motifs. At least a subset of human Myo9b light chains is calmodulin (CaM) (7.Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the unusual structure of the motor domain, motility chambers containing antibody-tethered human Myo9b exhibit robust, albeit slow (∼15 nm/s), gliding actin filament movements in vitro (7.Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Velocities are reduced in the presence of Ca2+, as has been observed for a number of CaM-containing myosins (reviewed in Refs. 12.Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar and 13.Coluccio L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myo9b does exhibit unusual actin-binding properties, in that this myosin co-sediments with actin in presence of ATP (7.Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a property it shares with myosin-Va (14.Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B.F. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15.Tauhata S.B. Vital Dos Santos D. Taylor E.W. Mooseker M.S. Larson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39812-39818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, high affinity binding to actin at steady state in the presence of ATP is thought to contribute to the unique motile properties of myosin-Va where biophysical studies have shown that this motor is capable of undergoing numerous interactions with an actin filament before diffusing away. Thus, myosin-Va is classified as a highly “processive” motor (16.Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich S.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). However, unlike myosin-Va, which is thought to generate processive motion through a coordinated interaction of two motor domains (16.Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich S.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 17.Walker M.L. Burgess S.A. Sellers J.R. Wang F. Hammer III, J.A. Trinick J. Knight P.J.

A. 2000; 97: 9482-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), the heavy chain of class IX myosins lacks coiled-coil forming α-helical segments and thus is predicted to be single-headed. In the present study we have further characterized the physical and mechanochemical properties of human Myo9b. Determination of the native molecular weight (Mr) indicates that this myosin is indeed single-headed. Moreover, an assessment of the motor properties of Myo9b as a function of motor surface density in the gliding actin filament assay indicates that like myosin-Va, Myo9b exhibits properties of a high duty ratio, processive actin-based motor. The sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of Myo9b was estimated by rate zonal centrifugation as follows. Human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (obtained from the Yale Pheresis Center as medically discarded cells) were homogenized (setting at maximum speed) with a handheld Omni Mixer micro-homogenizer (Omni International, Gainesville, VA) in Buffer A (25 mm HEPES, 0.6 m NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA-Na, 5 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 6.25 μg/ml leupeptin, 12.5 μg/ml pepstatin (all reagents from Sigma). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 227,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (175 μl) or 175 μl of a mixture of protein standards including myoglobin, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, aldolase, and catalase (Sigma) was layered onto 4.75-ml linear 6–20% (w/w) sucrose gradients in Buffer A and centrifuged for 17 h at 38,000 rpm in an SW 55 rotor at 4 °C. The elevated salt concentration of this buffer (0.6 m NaCl) was used for both the sucrose gradient and gel filtration (see below) to minimize artifactual molecular weight shifts of Myo9b caused by ATP-independent binding to small F-actin oligomers that may be present in the extract. Fractions of 259 μl were collected from the top of the tube. The sedimentation profile of the protein standards was determined by SDS-PAGE and that of Myo9b and myosin-IIa was determined by immunoblot analysis using affinity-purified anti-Myo9b tail (7.Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-human platelet myosin-IIa (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA). Blots were developed using the ECL method as recommended by the ECL reagent vendor (Pierce). The Stokes radius (RS) of Myo9b was estimated by chromatography of the ultraspeed supernatant fraction described above over a Sephacryl S500 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column equilibrated in Buffer A. The column was calibrated by adding proteins of known RS values to the supernatant. Proteins used included aldolase, catalase, ferritin, thyroglobulin, fibrinogen, and IgM. The included volume of the column was 174.5 ml, and the void volume was 59 ml. Elution profiles of the protein standards and myosins-IXb and -IIa were determined by SDS-PAGE (protein standards) or immunoblot analysis (myosins IXb and myosin-II). Human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells were homogenized in Buffer A and centrifuged as above. The ultraspeed supernatant was incubated with 50 mm1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Pierce) or an equivalent volume of Buffer A for 1 h at room temperature. The sizes of cross-linked myosins-IXb and -II were determined by SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis. In vitro motility assays using immunopurified Myo9b were performed exactly as described in Post et al. (7.Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that a human leukemia cell line (HL60) was used as the purification source. Briefly, motility chambers were coated with Protein A (0.5 mg/ml) and then incubated with anti-Myo9b (see below) and blocked with casein and bovine serum albumin, followed by overnight incubation with chromatographically (Q-Sepharose) enriched fractions of Myo9b. After adsorption of Myo9b, the motility chambers were washed with high salt (750 mm KCl) to remove nonspecifically adsorbed proteins that might interfere with motility and, in the context of the hydrodynamic studies, would also disrupt any salt-sensitive oligomeric complexes containing Myo9b. Thus, these motility assays were performed under conditions in which the Myo9b is presumably single-headed based on the hydrodynamic studies presented here. To determine the dependence of filament gliding velocity as a function of Myo9b motor density, the concentration of Myo9b trapping antibody was varied in the motility chambers from 0 to 200 μg/ml. The antibody solution was supplemented with rabbit non-immune IgG to keep the total IgG concentration in the motility chambers constant. The determination of Myo9b surface density at different antibody concentrations was performed using quantitative Western blots as reported previously (20.Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, motility chambers coated with a wide range of anti-tail IgG concentrations were incubated with Myo9b. The unbound protein fractions were then removed and processed for immunoblotting. Blots were developed using the ECL method; films were scanned, and the integrated optical density of each band was quantified using Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). These optical densities were calibrated, using known quantities of bacterially expressed Myo9b tail fusion protein (7.Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as standards, and represented the unbound quantity of M9 liberated from each chamber. Three independent sets of chambers were quantified in this way. IgG concentration versus molecules of Myo9/μm2 retained in each chamber (i.e. [input] − [unbound]) was then plotted, using data from three independent sets of chambers, to determine the range of anti-tail IgG over which Myo9b binding was linear. The slope of the linear region (5.5 μg/ml anti-tail IgG/molecule/μm2; R2 = 0.86) was used to calibrate the x axis of the motility plots. To estimate duty ratio from sliding filament velocities, a modification of the model originally developed by Uyeda et al. (19.Uyeda T. Kron S. Spudich J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) was used to generate theoretical curves for fitting velocity data as described previously (20.Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Here average filament velocity (Vavg) was expressed as a function of saturation velocity (Vmax), duty ratio (f), motor density (ρ), and the mean interaction area for the assay (Ā, roughly the product of the filament length and twice the reach of the motor) as indicated in Equation 1, Vavg(ρ)=Vmax(1−(1−f)ρ·A¯)Equation 1 For the purposes of creating the theoretical curves shown in Fig. 3A, different values of f were fixed with Vmax = 38.4 nm/s (from the best fit to the data) and Ā = 0.188 μm2 (from the landing rate fit, see below). The frequency of successful filament landing events (i.e. the appearance of an actin filament in the focal plane that then begins to move) as a function of Myo9b motor density was also determined. The results were used to estimate the total number of motor molecules required for filament movement as described by Howard et al.(21.Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Landing rates are plotted with errors derived from counting statistics (S.E. = mean landing rate/square root of n, where n = number of filaments observed (22.Hancock W.O. Howard J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar)). To obtain a lower limit for the number of motors required to bind and move a filament, the following model, originally described by Hancock and Howard (22.Hancock W.O. Howard J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), was used to fit landing rate data with respect to motor density as indicated in Equation 2, L(ρ)=Z(1−exp−ρ·A¯)nEquation 2 where L is the landing rate as a function motor density (ρ); Z is the maximum landing rate;Ā is the area of interaction surrounding a filament (as defined above), and n is the number of motor molecules required for a successful landing event. Values for Z, Ā, and n from the best fit (three free parameters) were 11.8 s−1 mm−2, Ā = 0.188 μm2, and n = 1.01. For the theoretical curves shown in Fig. 3B, n was fixed at either 1 or 2, and Ā and Z were left as free parameters. As revealed by visual inspection and fit statistics (n = 1, S.E. = 0.74, F statistic = 160; n = 2, S.E. = 0.92, F statistic = 100), the n = 1 curve provided the best fit to the data. To determine the native molecular weight of human leukocyte Myo9b, hydrodynamic characterization was performed using gel filtration chromatography and sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1). The measured Stokes radius (RS) was 10.2 nm, and the sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) was 7.3. RS and s20,wmeasurements were repeated at least three times and varied by 4%. These values were used to calculate (23.Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1961: 317-451Google Scholar) a native molecular weight for Myo9b of 302,500 (Table I). This molecular weight is comparable with the calculated value of 303,569 from primary sequence for a single heavy chain (using the average molecular weight of the two splice forms) and four CaM light chains (Myo9b has four IQ motifs and CaM co-immunoprecipitates with the protein (6.Wirth J.A. Jensen K.A. Post P.L. Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 653-661PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). These results demonstrate that Myo9b is a single-headed motor consisting of a single heavy chain and associated light chains.Table IHydrodynamic properties of human myosin-IXbs20,w7.3RS10.2 nmMraCalculated from equations: Mr=s20,wNo6πnRS1−v¯ρ and ff0=RS4ρNo3Mr(v¯+δρ)13 where Avogadro's number (No) = 6.02 × 1023, viscosity coefficient (n) = 1.00 × 10−2 g · s−1 · cm−1, solution density (ρ) = 1 g/cm3, and partial specific volume (v̄) and hydration value (δ) were assumed to be those of average soluble proteins = 0.72 cm3/g and 0.2, respectively.(measured)302,500MrbMr calculated from amino acid composition of Myo9b heavy chain (average of the two splice forms) and four CaM light chains.(calculated)303,569Frictional ratio (f/f0)aCalculated from equations: Mr=s20,wNo6πnRS1−v¯ρ and ff0=RS4ρNo3Mr(v¯+δρ)13 where Avogadro's number (No) = 6.02 × 1023, viscosity coefficient (n) = 1.00 × 10−2 g · s−1 · cm−1, solution density (ρ) = 1 g/cm3, and partial specific volume (v̄) and hydration value (δ) were assumed to be those of average soluble proteins = 0.72 cm3/g and 0.2, respectively.2.13a Calculated from equations: Mr=s20,wNo6πnRS1−v¯ρ and ff0=RS4ρNo3Mr(v¯+δρ)13 where Avogadro's number (No) = 6.02 × 1023, viscosity coefficient (n) = 1.00 × 10−2 g · s−1 · cm−1, solution density (ρ) = 1 g/cm3, and partial specific volume (v̄) and hydration value (δ) were assumed to be those of average soluble proteins = 0.72 cm3/g and 0.2, respectively.b Mr calculated from amino acid composition of Myo9b heavy chain (average of the two splice forms) and four CaM light chains. Open table in a new tab Results from chemical cross-linking experiments provide further evidence that Myo9b is single-headed. Human leukocyte extracts enriched for Myo9b were treated with the zero length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) (Fig. 2). Immunoblot analysis of the extract with and without cross-linker demonstrated that some of the cross-linked Myo9b migrates as a smear more slowly through the gel than uncross-linked Myo9b as would be expected for cross-linking of various CaM light chains to the heavy chain. However, all of the cross-linked Myo9b ran faster than the 340-kDa molecular mass marker (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with the measured native molecular weight for the molecule of 302,500 (Table I). Furthermore, cross-linked and presumably dimeric complexes of myosin-IIa present in the leukocyte extract ran much more slowly through the gel than cross-linked Myo9b (Fig. 2). If Myo9b were cross-linked into a dimer of two heavy chains and up to eight CaM light chains, it would have a molecular mass of ∼600 kDa (based on its amino acid composition) and would be expected to migrate more slowly through the gel than cross-linked myosin-II dimer (which has a molecular mass of ∼400–482 kDa depending on the number of light chains linked to the heavy chain). We have previously (7.Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used a modification of the gliding filament assay, in which Myo9b is immunoadsorbed onto the motility chamber using anti-tail antibodies, to demonstrate that this myosin is an active motor. In the gliding actin filament assay (24.Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), gliding velocity decreases sharply as a function of surface motor density for non-processive motors such as myosin-II (19.Uyeda T. Kron S. Spudich J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This can be explained by realizing that these motors are only strongly bound to actin for a small fraction of their total cycle time (attached duration/total cycle duration ∼0.05), i.e. they possess a low duty ratio. As a result, multiple motors are required to propel a filament at maximal velocity. In contrast, the velocity of the processive actin-based motor chicken myosin-Va is independent of density even at single motor/filament densities (16.Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich S.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 20.Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a property first shown for the processive motor kinesin using a gliding microtubule assay (21.Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). For these motors to be capable of producing continuous, maximal velocity at single motor/filament densities, they must possess a very high duty ratio (∼1). Therefore, observing filament gliding velocities as a function of surface motor density can provide insight concerning the cycling kinetics of a molecular motor and its potential to move processively. As a means to assess gliding velocities as a function of Myo9b motor density, motility chambers coated with varied concentrations of anti-tail antibodies were analyzed (0–200 μg/ml, keeping total IgG concentration at 200 μg/ml with non-immune rabbit IgG). Quantitative immunoblot analysis revealed that the surface density of adsorbed Myo9b increased in a linear fashion from 0.6 to 18.2 molecules/μm2 over a range of antibody dilutions from 0 to 100 μg ml, with no further increase in motor concentration above 200 μg/ml (Fig. 3A). As in our previous studies (7.Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we observed robust gliding movements in chambers that contain >3 μg/ml anti-tail antibody, whereas no movement was observed in chambers containing 0–3 μg/ml tail antibody. Above this concentration a constant average velocity of 38.2 ± 1.2 nm/s (mean across all densities ± S.E.) was observed at all concentrations. The velocity observed in this study is significantly faster than we observed previously (15 nm/s), most likely because freshly harvested, unfrozen HL-60 cells rather than frozen human leukocyte cell pellets were used to generate the partially purified fractions of Myo9b used to coat the chambers. The results of this analysis (Fig. 3A) clearly show that the velocities collected for Myo9b are independent of surface motor density. Moreover, these data are well fit to a theoretical curve describing a molecular motor with a duty ratio of 1, indicating that Myo9b is strongly bound to the filament for nearly its entire hydrolytic cycle. We have shown previously (20.Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that the failure to exhibit a decrease in velocity at low motor densities is not because of the antibody tethering method as reductions in velocity are observed for the non-processive class V myosins of yeast but not for the processive motor, myosin-Va. A second method for assaying the processivity of a motor protein requires measuring the frequency at which actin filaments land on a motility surface and begin to move (termed landing rate) with respect to surface motor density (22.Hancock W.O. Howard J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). By analyzing the landing rate decay over lower surface densities, it is possible to estimate the number of motor/filament interactions required to produce a successful landing event (n, see Equation 2 under “Experimental Procedures”). For processive motors such as kinesin (21.Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) and chicken myosin-Va (16.Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich S.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), this analysis reveals that only a single motor is required to move a single microtubule/actin filament. Landing rate data as a function of Myo9b surface density (Fig. 3B) was fit to Equation 2 (see under “Experimental Procedures”) (22.Hancock W.O. Howard J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,25.Sakakibara H. Kojima H. Sakai Y. Katayama E. Oiwa K. Nature. 1999; 400: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) to estimate the number of molecules (n) required for a successful landing event. The data are well fit by the theoretical curve where n = 1, indicating that one molecule of Myo9b is sufficient to bind and initiate the continuous movement of an actin filament (Fig. 3B). Measurements of the landing rates produced by antibody-tethered chick brain myosin-Va are also well fit by a curve with n = 1 indicating that the mechanical properties of an antibody-tethered motor molecule are unchanged (20.Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Another characteristic of processive motors like kinesin and myosin-Va is that at single motor densities the moving filament exhibits nodal pivoting, i.e. as the filament moves, it remains in focus at a single fixed point, the point of contact between a single motor and the moving filament. Nodal pivoting was observed in chambers containing low densities (3–10 μg/ml anti Myo9b) of Myo9b (Fig. 4). Moreover, at these low densities, filaments generally exhibited movements less than or equal to their length. There are two major conclusions from this study. First, as predicted from the primary structure of Myo9b heavy chain, this is a single-headed motor consisting of a single heavy chain and associated light chains. Two independent lines of evidence, hydrodynamic determination of native molecular weight and chemical cross-linking studies support this conclusion. Because these analyses were performed using high salt extracts, it is possible that Myo9b could be part of a larger oligomeric complex under physiological conditions that could include multiple Myo9b molecules as well as other components that contribute to its functions in vivo. However, the single-headed molecule is clearly sufficient for both GAP and motor activity. Another critical question that remains unanswered with respect to subunit composition of this myosin is whether or not all the neck-associated light chains are composed of CaM or, like the class V myosins chicken myosin-Va and yeast Myo2p, consist of a mixture of CaM and other members of the EF-hand family of proteins (26.Espindola F.S. Suter D.M. Partata L.B. Cao T. Wolenski J.S. Cheney R.E. King S.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 269-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Stevens R.C. Davis T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Resolution of this question will require development of techniques for purification of sufficient Myo9b for direct protein sequence analysis. The second conclusion is that although it is single-headed, Myo9b exhibits in vitro motility properties consistent with a high duty ratio, processive motor. This is a finding consistent with our previous findings (7.Post P.L. Bokoch G.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 941-950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that this myosin co-sediments with actin in both the absence and presence of ATP. The results showing that very low densities of motor can support movement of filaments without a density-dependent reduction in velocity indicates that this unusual actin binding behavior is not due to the presence of a second actin-binding site on the tail. Rather, like vertebrate myosin-Va, it is due to high affinity binding of the motor domain to actin in the presence of ATP. Although the motility data presented here suggest that Myo9b is processive, it is possible that, because of the nature of the bivalent antibody tether, multiple motors sequestered within a single protein A-IgG complex could work in tandem to mimic the motile behavior of a processive motor. Arguments against the formation of random “aggregates” of Myo9b are based on the landing rate data. Previous control studies using the well characterized motor, myosin-Va, have shown that immunoadsorbed myosin-Va generates landing rate data that are well fit by Equation 2 with n = 1 (20.Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a result identical to previous reports (16.Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich S.A. Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Nature. 1999; 400: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) using direct surface adsorption techniques. Also, as argued by others (21.Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), a good fit to Equation 2 would not be expected if the motility surface presented a mixed population of protein A-IgG complexes with one (1:1) or more (N:1) myosins bound. Moreover, the ratio of myosin tail ligand to anti-tail IgG varies across the densities sampled in these experiments and would add further complexity by varying the extent of N:1 complex formation at each IgG concentration. The good fit of both the myosin-Va control (20.Reck-Peterson S.L. Tyska M.J. Novick P.J. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and the Myo9b landing rate data to Equation 2 strongly argues that the ligand concentration we are presenting to the motility surface in these assays is below that required for significant aggregation of motor. Consequently, we feel that this assay is valid to assess the overall motile properties of tissue-obtained actin-based motors, which because of very low expression levels are not readily purified by conventional methods. Moreover, although much more detailed analysis of such motors can be obtained using in vitro expressed protein, a comparison with tissue-purified motor is essential to verify that the in vitro protein is comparable with the protein expressed in vivo. To ensure that a Myo9b molecule does not diffuse away from its track during an advance, this myosin may invoke a mechanism similar to that originally proposed for the processive movement of the single-headed kinesin, KIF1A (28.Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This motor contains a highly charged surface loop in the motor domain that weakly tethers the motor to the microtubule preventing diffusion away from the microtubule surface. The electrostatic tether allows the motor to undergo one-dimensional diffusion along its track in search of its next strong binding site (28.Okada Y. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The large, highly basic insertion at the actin contact site of Myo9b is an obvious candidate to participate in a similar mode of processive movement along the actin filament. Analysis of the behavior of single Myo9b motors during single steps, under unloaded and loaded conditions, will be required to determine whether a similar Brownian motor model is operative for Myo9b. Although highly speculative, it is of interest to consider how such processive motor behavior could contribute to the presumed primary biological function of class IX myosins, down-regulation of Rho-dependent signaling pathways. Its high affinity for actin may simply provide a means to localize the Rho-GAP activity, moving the motor slowly toward the ends (presumably barbed ends, but polarity of movement has yet to be determined) of filament arrays that are being remodeled during down-regulation of Rho signaling cascades. It will also be of interest to determine whether there are any regulatory interactions on the motor activity of Myo9b and various Rho-signaling elements, including Rho itself."

A missense mutation in the inhibitory region of TnI replaces an arginine residue at position 145 with a glycine and cosegregates with the disease. Results from several assays indicate that the inhibitory function of HCTnIR145G is significantly reduced. When HCTnIR145G was incorporated into whole troponin, TnR145G(HCTnT·HCTnIR145G·HCTnC), only partial inhibition of the actin-tropomyosin-myosin ATPase activity was observed in the absence of Ca2+ compared with wild type Tn (HCTnT·HCTnI·HCTnC). Maximal activation of actin-tropomyosin-myosin ATPase in the presence of Ca2+ was also decreased in TnR145G when compared with Tn. Using skinned cardiac muscle fibers, we determined that in comparison with the wild type complex 1) the complex containing HCTnIR145G only inhibited 84% of Ca2+-unregulated force, 2) the recovery of Ca2+-activated force was decreased, and 3) there was a significant increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development. Computer modeling of troponin C and I variables predicts that the primary defect in TnI caused by these mutations would lead to diastolic dysfunction. These results suggest that severe diastolic dysfunction and somewhat decreased contractility would be prominent clinical features and that hypertrophy could arise as a compensatory mechanism.

Three other TnI FHC mutants (S199N, Lys-183 deletion, and an exon 8 deletion mutant encompassing the stop codon of the cardiac TnI gene) have recently been discovered (11.Morner S. Richard P.

Functionally TnI is the inhibitory subunit of the troponin (Tn) complex that controls the interaction between actin and myosin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (13.Greaser M. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Sheng Z. Pan B. Miller T.E. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

Studies using proteolytic fragments of fast skeletal TnI identified the central TnI sequence (residues 96–116) as being responsible for its inhibitory activity. Residues 104–115 of fast skeletal TnI (comparable to residues 136–147 in cardiac TnI) formed the minimum sequence necessary for inhibition of muscle contraction (16.Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12374-12378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2798-2802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Van Eyk J.E.

Two of these mutations occur within the inhibitory region of TnI at a highly conserved amino acid residue (R145G and R145Q). The HCTnIR145G mutation has been investigated previously by Elliot et al. (20.Elliott K. Watkins H. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22069-22074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and shown to reduce the inhibition of the actin-Tm-activated myosin ATPase. Additional biochemical studies of the HCTnIR145G mutation and other FHC mutations are necessary to understand the mechanism by which this mutation and other hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations cause cardiac hypertrophy and sudden death. Currently the mechanism by which this mutation and other TnI FHC mutations cause cardiac hypertrophy and sudden death is uncertain but may involve primarily defects in relaxation (21.Hernandez O.M. Housmans P.R. Potter J.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22.Knollmann B.C. Potter J.D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present investigation we have determined how this arginine to glycine change within the inhibitory region of TnI alters the inhibitory function and how this mutation may cause deviations in the normal mechanisms of contraction as an explanation for its association with FHC. This article is the first report of the R145G mutation impairing force development, reducing maximal force, and reducing muscle relaxation. This is the first report of the R145G mutation being used in skinned cardiac fibers and to show that R145G impairs force development and relaxation. Mathematical simulations of intact cardiac fibers, in which the Ca2+ affinity of troponin C and the effectiveness of troponin I as an inhibitor were altered, predict a lower contractility and an increased resting tension in HCTnIR145G myocardium compared with the normal myocardium. These intrinsic contractile changes will likely result in diastolic dysfunction in vivo. The HCTnI mutants (R145G and A86T,R145G) were formed by overlapping PCR using HCTnI cDNA previously cloned in our laboratory from human cardiac tissue (23.Zhang R. Zhao J. Mandveno A. Potter J.D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The sequence of the TnI mutants was verified by sequencing prior to expression and purification. HCTnI, HCTnIR145G, and HCTnIA86T,R145G were purified via conventional methods. Briefly, crude bacterial supernatants were purified by column chromatography on an S-Sepharose column at 4 °C and eluted with a linear KCl gradient of 0–0.5m in a Tris-HCl buffer containing 6 m urea. Semipure HCTnI and HCTnI mutants were dialyzed against a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m KCl, 1m urea, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm CaCl2 and loaded onto an affinity column having covalently bound HCTnC. Pure HCTnI and HCTnI mutants were eluted with a gradient of 0–3 mm EDTA and 1–6 murea. The purity of the TnI proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Formation of the human cardiac troponin complexes containing recombinant TnT, TnC, and TnI was carried out as recently described by Szczesna et al. (24.Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Proper stoichiometry was verified by SDS-PAGE. Although we do not routinely analyze reconstituted Tns formed by our method by chromatography, gel filtration of these Tn complexes showed that this reconstitution method resulted in a single species. Porcine cardiac myosin, rabbit skeletal F-actin, porcine cardiac tropomyosin, and recombinant human cardiac TnC were prepared as described previously (25.Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The ATPase inhibitory assay was performed in a 1-ml reaction mixture of 100 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7. The ATPase activation assay was carried out in the same 1-ml reaction mixture with 1 mm EDTA replaced with 0.5 m CaCl2. F-actin (3.5 μm), myosin (0.6 μm), and Tm (1 μm) were homogenized (24.Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and added to the reaction tube after the addition of buffer and either wild type human cardiac Tn (WTHCTn), human cardiac Tn containing TnIR145G(HCTnR145G), or human cardiac Tn containing TnIA86T,R145G (HCTnA86T,R145G) to the assay tube. The ATPase reaction was initiated with the addition of ATP and stopped after 20 min with 50% trichloroacetic acid. After sedimenting the precipitate, the inorganic phosphate concentration in the supernatant was determined according to the method of Fiske and Subbarow (26.Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The ATPase rates, measured by a single time point, were predetermined to be linear with time. Cardiac skinned muscle fibers were prepared following a common laboratory procedure published by Zhang et al. (23.Zhang R. Zhao J. Mandveno A. Potter J.D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated porcine hearts were incubated in an O2-saturated solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mmNaHPO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. The hearts were obtained within 1 h of slaughter from a local slaughterhouse near the University of Miami. Cardiac muscle bundles were dissected from the left ventricle of the porcine hearts and were chemically skinned by incubating with 50% glycerol and 1% Triton X-100 in the relaxing solution (pCa 8.0) containing 10−8m Ca2+, 5 mm Mg2+, 7 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 15 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, pH 7.0, at an ionic strength of 150 mm at 4 °C for 24 h. These skinned muscle preparations were dissected into small bundles (1–2 cm in length, 2–3 mm in diameter) and were stored at −20 °C in the same solution without Triton X-100 before use. The skinned fiber preparation was mounted with stainless steel clips on a force transducer and was immersed in the contracting solution to measure initial force before treatment. The contraction solution (pCa 4) had the same composition as the relaxation buffer except for the increased Ca2+ concentration (10−4m). To determine the Ca2+dependence of force development, the contraction of the skinned fibers was tested in solutions of intermediate concentrations of Ca2+. The Ca2+ dependence of force was determined before and after performing the displacement and reconstitution protocols that are described below. To remove the endogenous Tn complex, the TnT displacement method was used (24.Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27.Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 205: 985-993Google Scholar). The cardiac fiber was incubated with HCTnT (0.8 mg/ml) for a total of 2.5 h with an intermediate buffer change containing fresh HCTnT. After displacement of the endogenous complex by HCTnT, the level of unregulated force development was observed by measuring the level of force reached by skinned fibers in both the pCa 8 solution and the pCa 4 solution. To determine the Ca2+dependence of force development, the contraction of skinned fibers was tested in solutions with intermediate concentrations of Ca2+ (from pCa 8 to pCa 4). The Ca2+ dependence was determined before and after treatment of the skinned fibers with displacement and reconstitution solutions. The Ca2+ dependence data were fit to the Hill equation with SIGMAPLOT (Jandel Scientific): relative force (%) = [Ca2+]n/([Ca2+]n+ [Ca50]n), where p K is the midpoint (pCa50) and n is the Hill coefficient. Control experiments carried out on porcine fibers treated the same way as described above but without any protein showed that the average rundown for these fibers was ∼12–18%. Taking this average rundown of the fibers into account the average recovered force for these skinned fiber studies is ∼70% of the original force before treatment with TnT and reconstitution with TnI-TnC. The average force at the end of these experiments is ∼60% of the initial force. All data are presented as mean ± S.D. CD spectra of the HCTnI and two mutants were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a cell pathlength of 0.1 cm at ambient temperature (20 °C) in a 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl solution. Spectra were recorded at 200–250 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm at a speed of 50 nm/min and a resolution of 0.2 nm. Analysis and processing of data was done using the Jasco system software (Windows Standard Analysis, version 1.20). Ten scans were averaged, base lines were subtracted, and no numerical smoothing was applied. Mean residue ellipticity ([θ]MRE, in degrees·cm2/dmol) for the spectra were calculated (using the Jasco system software) using the following equation: [θ]MRE = [θ]/(10·Cr·l), where [θ] is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, Cr is the mean residue molar concentration, and l is the path length in cm. The α-helical content for each protein was calculated using the standard equation for [θ] at 222 nm (28.Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar): [θ]222 = −30,300fH − 2,340, where fH is the fraction of α-helical content (fH × 100, expressed in %). Spectra are presented as the mean residue ellipticity. To assess the impact of changes incurred in force regulation in cardiac skinned fibers by HCTnIR145G, we used a quantitative computer model that integrates Ca2+ binding to various buffers in cardiac cells to predict the amplitude and time course of the intracellular Ca2+ transient, of Ca2+ bound to each of various Ca2+ buffers (TnC, calmodulin, and sarcoplasmic reticulum uptake), and of force. This method quantifies buffering of intracellular Ca2+, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and uptake, and free [Ca2+]i based on an initially assumed intracellular free Ca2+ transient and published rate constants (29.Fabiato A. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: C1-C14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Blinks J.R. Endoh M. Circulation. 1986; 73: III85-III98PubMed Google Scholar). The model is similar to that of Robertson et al. (31.Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Potter J.D. Biophys. J. 1981; 34: 559-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and in addition incorporates the following processes: (a) a variation of the Ca2+ affinity of TnC with developed force (koff =koff.rest e−gain × relative force) (33.Housmans P.R. Wanek L.A. Carton E.G. Bartunek A.E. Anesthesiology. 2000; 93: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34.Landesberg A. Sideman S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1260-H1271PubMed Google Scholar), (b) a modulation of TnI effectiveness as an inhibitor dependent primarily on the concentration of the Ca2+·TnC complex (TnIeffect = [Tn] × (1 − TiAmp × e−TiPower × [CaT]), where TiAmp and TiPower are amplitude and gain variables of the effectiveness of TnI to inhibit actomyosin interactions, and (c) a two-state cross-bridge model (32.Mikane T. Araki J. Kohno K. Nakayama Y. Suzuki S. Shimizu J. Matsubara H. Hirakawa M. Takaki M. Suga H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2891-H2898PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive details of this quantitative computer model can be found in the methods and appendix sections of Miller et al. (35.Miller T. Szczesna D. Housmans P.R. Zhao J. de Freitas F. Gomes A.V. Culbreath L. McCue J. Wang Y. Xu Y. Kerrick W.G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3743-3755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) along with the additional features mentioned above. The terms used in this computer model are briefly described below. The rate of release of Ca2+ from TnC is slowed by the presence of cross-bridges. koff(TnC·Ca) therefore becomes smaller as cross-bridges form and force develops (34.Landesberg A. Sideman S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1260-H1271PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6751-6756Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38.Hofmann P.A. Fuchs F. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C541-C546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exponential dependence of koff(TnC·Ca) on force is based on experimental observations in cardiac and skeletal muscle (32.Mikane T.

Physiol. 1994; 266: H1260-H1271PubMed Google Scholar) and is quantified by the equation koff.TnC·Ca = koff.TnC·Ca.rest × e−gain × relative force, where koff.TnC·Ca.restis the off-rate of Ca2+ from TnC in the absence of force development. For the simulations used in this study, gain was set at 8. Fig. 7A illustrates the strong dependence of the dissociation rate of Ca2+ from TnC as a function of force. The model assumes that for each Ca2+·TnC complex, an effective relief of inhibition by TnI occurs according to the following relationship: TnIeff = [Tn] × (1 − TiAmp × e−TiPower × [CaT], where TiAmp and TiPower are amplitude and gain variables of TnI. In control conditions (WT), TiAmp = 1 and TiPower = 10,000. These values were found by multiple iterations in values of TiPower, gain of TnC-Ca2+binding, and koff.TnC·Ca.rest to reproduce the values found for skinned fibers containing HCTnI (WT). Fig. 7B (solid line) illustrates the relationship between [CaT] and effective [TnI]. The latter value was used as a proxy for [CaT] in further calculations of force. For the cross-bridge on and off kinetics, Huxley's 1957 model (36.Huxley A.F. Prog. Biophys. Biophys.

Araki J. Kohno K. Nakayama Y. Suzuki S. Shimizu J. Matsubara H. Hirakawa M. Takaki M. Suga H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2891-H2898PubMed Google Scholar), f is the attachment (on) rate constant of detached cross-bridges, g is the detachment (off) rate of attached cross-bridges, and TnIeff is the effective TnI concentration permitting actomyosin interactions consequent to Ca2+ occupancy of TnC. We assumed constant values for f = 400,000 mol·kg−1·s−1 and g = 10 s−1. Finally force is displayed as normalized to maximal force that could theoretically be obtained, i.e. as the ratio [CB]/[total CB]. Simulations for reproducing experimental results of skinned fibers were carried out for equilibrium conditions in pCa values of 8–4 in 0.1-pCa steps. Values of koff.TnC·Ca.rest, gain (TnC-Ca2+ binding dependence on force), and TiAmp and TiPower (amplitude and gain of TnI effectiveness as an inhibitor) were varied until a unique combination of values produced pCa-force relations with identical pCa50 and Hill n coefficients as the wild type. The same procedure was carried out to simulate pCa-force relations of the HCTnIR145F mutant for which a unique convergent solution was found. Cross-bridge variables were not changed. Subsequently variables found from simulations in skinned fibers were fed into the simulation programs that generate twitch contractions of intact cardiac fibers. In the initial control conditions, once sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release was obtained, steady-state control conditions were obtained by repeating the simulation over several successive twitch contractions by setting the initial values of [Ca2+], [CaT], [CaC], and [CB] of a given twitch to their values obtained at the end of the previous twitch (where [CaC] is calmodulin occupied with Ca2+ and [CaT] is troponin occupied with Ca2+). Simulations carried out for a change in one or more rate constants or variables were also allowed to reach steady-state conditions over several twitches. In most instances, steady-state conditions were reached in 3–5 contractions at frequencies corresponding to heart rates of 150 min−1. We simulated force during a twitch that would occur if one or more of the following would be affected by the presence of HCTnIR145G on the thin filament: (a) a decrease in the resting (zero force) off-rate Ca2+ from the Ca2+-specific site of TnC (koff(TnC·Ca)) from a control value of 700 s−1 and/or (b) a decrease in the amplitude (TiAmp) and gain (TiPower) of troponin I to inhibit actomyosin interactions. We chose not to alter cross-bridge kinetic variables as there is no a priori reason to assume that the mutation would directly affect actomyosin kinetic behavior. Based on each possible effect of HCTnIR145G (see “Results”) this theoretical analysis predicts muscle contraction and relaxation as would be encountered in vivo and provides for a series of hypotheses that could be tested in the hearts of HCTnIR145Gtransgenic animals. The calculations were programmed in Microsoft Quickbasic 4.0 and run on a personal computer, and the results (saved as ASCII files) were replotted with SigmaPlot 5.0 (SPSS, Inc., Richmond, CA). Fig. 1A is a diagrammatical representation of the primary sequence of human cardiac TnI showing regions known to be involved in binding TnC, TnT, and tropomyosin. All identified FHC TnI mutations are shown by arrows and occur on the COOH-terminal half of TnI. Residue 86 in the NH2-terminal half of TnI is also shown by an arrow and represents a conflict in the first HCTnI sequence published by Vallins et al. (where residue 86 was Thr (41.Vallins W.J. Brand N.J. Dabhade N. Butler-Browne G. Yacoub M.H. Barton P.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)) and later HCTnI sequences that coded for Ala at residue 86 (42, 43). Fig. 1B shows an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of purified wild type and mutant TnIs used in these studies. We examined the ability of HCTnIR145G and WTHCTnI to inhibit F-actin-Tm-activated myosin ATPase activity in reconstituted thin filament systems to determine whether the inhibitory activity of the HCTnIR145Gmutant of TnI was affected by the missense mutation within the inhibitory region of the protein. We discovered that while the wild type HCTnI was able to inhibit ATPase activity nearly fully (approximately 90% at 3 μm HCTnI concentration), HCTnIR145G was less effective at inhibiting actomyosin ATPase activity even at higher protein concentrations (<60% at 4 μm HCTnI concentration, Fig. 2). When TnR145G was reconstituted with actin, Tm, and myosin in the presence of EGTA, the ability of the mutant complex to inhibit ATPase activity was significantly less (20–25% lower at Tn concentrations between 1–2 μm) than wild type Tn (Fig. 3A). In the presence of EGTA wild type Tn (2 μm) inhibited the actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase activity by 82 ± 4%. Under the same conditions used for the wild type Tn, HCTnR145G inhibited the actin-TM-activated myosin ATPase activity by 61 ± 4%. The maximum ATPase activity for TnR145G in the presence of Ca2+ was also less (25% lower at Tn concentrations between 1–2 μm) than wild type Tn (Fig. 3B). In these experiments the amount of Tn required for maximal ATPase activation was 1–1.5 μm, which is consistent with a ratio of Tn:Tm of 1:1(which is considered to be the physiological ratio of these components in intact muscle fibers). The amount of Tn required for maximal ATPase inhibition (in the absence of Ca2+) was 1.5–2 μm. We used a well established method in our laboratory (24.Szczesna D. Zhang R. Zhao J. Jones M. Guzman G. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 624-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to displace the endogenous Tn complex from skinned porcine skinned cardiac muscle preparations. In these experiments, after displacing the endogenous porcine Tn complex with HCTnT (0.8 mg/ml) either wild type HCTnI·HCTnC, HCTnIR145G·HCTnC, or HCTnIA86T,R145G·HCTnC complexes were used to reconstitute the HCTnT-replaced skinned fibers. After determining the level of unregulated force in skinned fibers, they were incubated with either wild type or mutant HCTnI·HCTnC complexes in low calcium buffer (pCa 8). This allowed us to determine whether the TnI proteins could fully inhibit Ca2+-unregulated force established after treatment with HCTnT and also to determine whether the proteins were able to fully reconstitute the skinned fibers by forming a functional Tn complex. Wild type HCTnI·CTnC complex resulted in complete inhibition of Ca2+-unregulated force. However, when the skinned fibers were incubated with the HCTnIR145G·HCTnC complex, only 84% inhibition of unregulated force was observed (Figs. 4 and 5B). Full inhibition of unregulated force was not achieved with the complex containing the mutant TnI even after an extended incubation time of 2.5 h (data not shown). The data depicted in the absence of Ca2+ represents the level of force remaining after reconstituting the fibers with the appropriate TnI·TnC complex (Figs. 4 and 5B). This level of force is equivalent to the percentage of Ca2+-unregulated force that was not inhibited by the Tn complex. The fibers reconstituted with TnR145G were able to inhibit only 84% of unregulated force compared with 100% inhibition by wild type Tn. Recovered force is equivalent to the level of force developed in fibers after reconstituting the fibers with the appropriate Tn complex and treating the fiber with pCa 4 solution. Recove"

Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 785-794Google Scholar, 6.Hahm K. Ernst P. Lo K. Kim G.S. Turck C. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7111-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These Ikaros proteins differ in the number of N-terminal zinc fingers that constitute their DNA binding domain. Ikaros isoforms with at least three N-terminal zinc fingers (i.e. Ik-1, Ik-2 and Ik-3) are capable of binding a high affinity Ikaros site that contains the GGGAA core motif, whereas all other isoforms cannot bind this site (5.Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 785-794Google Scholar). Nonetheless, all of the Ikaros isoforms share two hunchback-related zinc fingers at their C terminus, which are necessary for dimerization between Ikaros proteins and family members (7.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Interactions between Ikaros isoforms that can and cannot bind DNA compromise the ability of the resulting complex to bind DNA (7.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 8.Georgopoulos K. Bigby M. Wang J.-H. Molnár Á. Wu P. Winandy S. Sharpe A. Cell. 1994; 79: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). This indicates that the non-DNA binding Ikaros isoforms can act as naturally occurring dominant negative factors to regulate the activity of the DNA binding isoforms. A role for Ikaros is manifested from the earliest steps of the hemopoietic pathway. Lack of Ikaros causes a significant reduction (30–40-fold) in hemopoietic stem cell activity that is made more severe (>100-fold) by the increased expression of its dominant negative isoforms (9.Nichogiannopoulou A. Trevisan M. Naben S. Friedrich C. Georgopoulos K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1201-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Lineage restriction of multipotent hemopoietic progenitors toward the lymphoid pathways is severely affected in the absence of Ikaros. Mice homozygous for an Ikaros null mutation lack all B, natural killer, and fetal T cells as well as the earliest described lymphoid progenitor (10.Wang J. Nichogiannopoulou A. Wu L. Sun L. Sharpe A. Bigby M. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1996; 5: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, some postnatal T cell precursors are generated in these mice, though they display skewing in their differentiation toward the CD4/TCRαβ lineage (10.Wang J. Nichogiannopoulou A. Wu L. Sun L. Sharpe A. Bigby M. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1996; 5: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The limited number of Ikaros-deficient thymocytes and mature T cells display a T cell receptor-mediated hyperproliferative phenotype in vitro and undergo rapid clonal expansions in vivo (10.Wang J. Nichogiannopoulou A. Wu L. Sun L. Sharpe A. Bigby M. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1996; 5: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for a mutation that generates only dominant negative Ikaros isoforms display similar but more severe defects (8.Georgopoulos K. Bigby M. Wang J.-H. Molnár Á. Wu P. Winandy S. Sharpe A. Cell. 1994; 79: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In addition to the B and natural killer cell deficiency, they lack all fetal and adult T cells. Mice heterozygous for this mutation have lymphocyte populations that appear normal; however, their T cells display augmented T cell receptor-mediated proliferative responses, and they rapidly develop leukemias and lymphomas (11.Winandy S. Wu P. Georgopoulos K. Cell. 1995; 83: 289-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 12.Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K.

The more severe phenotype of the dominant negative compared with the null mice suggested the presence of family members whose activity was affected by this mutation. Consistent with this hypothesis, three family members were identified (Aiolos (14.Morgan B. Sun L. Avitahl N. Andrikopoulos K. Gonzales E. Nichogiannopoulou A. Wu P. Neben S. Georgopoulos K.

The aforementioned studies identify Ikaros as an important regulator of several steps in the hemolymphoid pathways (2.Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 3.Cortes, M., Wong, E., Koipally, J., and Georgopoulos, K. (1999)Curr. Opin. Immunol.Google Scholar, 4.Koipally J. Kim J.

The mechanisms by which Ikaros operates along this pathway have been the focus of diverse studies, some of which implicate it as a repressor of gene expression for the following reasons. First, in actively cycling primary lymphocytes, Ikaros concentrates in distinctive toroidal structures, which are found in apposition to pericentromeric heterochromatin and a variety of transcriptionally silent genes (20.Brown K.E. Guest S.S. Smale S.T. Hahm K. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Cell. 1997; 91: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Second, in late S phase, some of the Ikaros toroids become coincident with clusters of DNA replication origins, which presumably are sites of replicating heterochromatin (12.Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Third, a biochemical purification of Ikaros from lymphocytes has determined that the majority of Ikaros exists within a stable 2MD complex containing components of the NuRD1 complex that includes the ATPase, Mi-2β, and Class I histone deacetylases that are presumed to play a role in repression (21.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), while a smaller fraction of Ikaros also interacts with the putative co-repressors Sin3 and C-terminal binding protein (22.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23.Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. B. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Fourth, heterologous fusions of Ikaros to the Gal4 DNA binding domain behave as potent transcriptional repressors (22.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that Ikaros may be involved in the repression of the λ5 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase genes (24.Sabbattini P. Lundgren M. Georgiou A. Chow C. Warnes G. Dillon N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2812-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25.Trinh L.A. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Weinmann A.S. Hahm K. Ernst P. Garraway I.P. Merkenschlager M. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1817-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Ikaros has also been reported to function as an activator of transcription. Ectopic expression of Ikaros with reporters containing engineered Ikaros sites in non-lymphoid cells results in gene activation (1.Georgopoulos K. Moore D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 5.Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 785-794Google Scholar, 7.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Gene expression-profiling experiments in Ikaros-deficient hemopoietic precursors further support such a role; expression of the tyrosine kinase receptors flk-2 and c-kit in early hemopoietic progenitors is reduced in the absence of Ikaros (9.Nichogiannopoulou A. Trevisan M. Naben S. Friedrich C. Georgopoulos K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1201-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Ikaros has also been reported to activate from the enhancer of a mink cell focus-inducing virus (26.DiFronzo N.L. Leung C.T. Mammel M.K. Georgopoulos K. Taylor B.J. Pham Q.N. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Additionally, Ikaros functions as a suppressor of variegation for regulatory elements of the CD8 locus. 2D. Kioussis, personal communication. Ikaros' potential to function as a repressor and activator of gene expression may provide a molecular basis for its diverse effects in the hemolymphoid system. To gain further insight into this important problem in lymphocyte biology, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional properties of Ikaros. Here we report that Ikaros is indeed capable of enhancing gene expression as a potentiator of bona fide transcriptional activators and not by functioning as a classical activator. Potentiation by Ikaros requires its intact DNA binding and dimerization domains, both of which are necessary for its recruitment into a PC-HC-associated nuclear compartment in cycling cells. We show that there is an unexpected correlation between Ikaros localization to these heterochromatin-associated sites and its ability to activate gene expression. These studies also indicate that the presence of Ikaros in this nuclear compartment provide a “landing pad” for its chromatin remodeling partner Mi-2β and presumably the NuRD complex. Two models are proposed to explain these findings. 4X IkBS2tkCAT and tkCAT have been previously described (5.Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 785-794Google Scholar). 4XIKAS1tkCAT were constructed by cloning ligated oligonucleotides containing the corresponding sites into the tkCAT reporter by standard cloning methods. 4XSp1E1BCAT, G5E1BCAT, CMV2Flag, CMV2Flag-Ik1, CMV2Flag-Ik1M, BXG1, and BXG1-Ik1 have been described previously (22.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23.Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. B. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). CMV2Flag-Ikaros and BXG1-Ikaros DBD and activation domain mutants described in this paper were constructed using the Stratagene mutagenesis kit. 293T and NIH-3T3 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Transfections of these cell lines were carried out using the HBS-CaP04 method. For repression assays, 1 μg of the Gal4 fusion plasmid, 10 μg of the Gal4 reporter plasmid, and 0.5 μg of the pXGH5 growth hormone control plasmid were used. For activation assays, typically 1.5 μg of the reporter, 0.25 μg of Ikaros expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of the GH plasmid were used. 24 h after transfection, cells were fed with fresh media, and 18–24 h later cells were harvested and processed for CAT assays as described (22.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Growth hormone assays were done as recommended by the manufacturer (Nichols Institute). Transfections were typically performed in duplicate and repeated between three to six times. For interaction experiments, 293T cells were transfected with 1–2 μg of the CMV2Flag vector expressing the Ikaros protein of choice. 24 h later, cells were fed with fresh media, and 48 h later cells were harvested to prepare nuclear or whole cell extracts. For immunofluorescence studies, NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with 9 μg of expression plasmid and 1 μg of GH plasmid using ProVera TransIT-L1 transfection reagent. 36 h after transfection, cells were harvested for fixation and staining as described below. Whole-cell extracts from 293T cells transfected with the relevant plasmids were prepared as previously described (7.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and precleared using protein-G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The precleared extracts were incubated with the antibody of interest or the relevant isotype control on ice for 1 h. 30 μl of protein-G beads were then added to the extract, and the extracts were rotated overnight. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with TS buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl) (7.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The beads obtained after this procedure were treated with SDS sample buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 15 min, and loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with 8–10% of the cell extract used for the immunoprecipitation. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the relevant antibody, and examined by autoradiography with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used were: FLAG M2 (Sigma), Gal4 (Santa Cruz), HDAC2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and anti-Ikaros and Mi-2, which have been previously described (21.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from 293T cells transfected with the Ikaros constructs in either CDM8-flag or CMV-2-flag expression vectors as previously described (23.Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. B. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The relative amount of each Ikaros protein was determined by Western blotting using the Ikaros monoclonal antibody, 8H2, and roughly normalized. DNA mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (7.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The IKBS1 oligonucleotide TCAGCTTTTGGGAATACCCTGTTCA, containing a high affinity Ikaros binding site, was used as well as an oligonucleotide designed for the altered site specificity Ikaros constructs f2s1 and f2s6, IKAS1, TCAGCTTTTGGGAGTACCCTGTTCA. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides were prepared by end labeling with [32P]dATP 6000 Ci/mmol (NEN Life Science Products) and then annealed to their complement. A cold competitor oligonucleotide, without an Ikaros binding site, TCAGCTTTTGAAAATACCCTGTTCA, IKm, was added to all reactions to reduce background. A mix of three Ikaros monoclonal antibodies, 4E9A4, 8H2, IK14, was used for the supershift experiments. Cells were transfected as described above, cytospun onto Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher), fixed, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice, and washed repeatedly. Slides were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature and stained with a 1:200-dilution of anti-Ikaros antibody 4E9-A4 overnight at 4 °C. Slides were washed and incubated with a 1:200-dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG for 45 min at room temperature. Slides were counterstained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and mounted with Vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Control staining was performed with an isotype-matched primary antibody; immunoreagents were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Images were obtained with an Olympus BX50 (Tokyo, Japan) fluorescent microscope with blue and UV filter modules. We have previously shown that ectopic expression of Ikaros and its family members can transactivate reporter genes (5.Molnár Á. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 785-794Google Scholar, 7.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, the localization of Ikaros in nuclear structures that are in apposition to centromeric heterochromatin and silent genes, coupled with molecular data showing that it can repress transcription, has called into question its function as an activator (12.Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20.Brown K.E. Guest S.S. Smale S.T. Hahm K. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Cell. 1997; 91: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 21.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 22.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activators typically contain at least one module, termed an activation domain, which is required to enable their interaction with co-activators and the RNA polymerase II complex. Using a yeast one-hybrid assay, a single bipartite activation domain was identified in Ikaros (7.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This domain is present at the very N-terminal region of the last exon of Ikaros and is comprised of a putative α helical region followed by a β sheet, both of which are required for maximal activation in Gal4-tethering assays in mammalian cells. The activation domain is highly conserved between the Ikaros family members, Aiolos and Helios, and to a lesser extent in Eos/Daedalus; heterologous fusions of this domain from all Ikaros family members are capable of similar levels of activation (data not shown). The functional importance of this domain was examined in the context of the full-length Ikaros protein. Several different mutations were generated in this region and tested for their effect on Ikaros' transactivation function on an Ikaros binding site-driven reporter (Fig. 1A, 4XIKBS2tkCAT). Testing of Ikaros and its mutant variants was performed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts for the following reasons. First, neither Ikaros nor any of its family members are expressed in this cell line. Second, ectopic expression of Ikaros and family members in these cells recapitulates their nuclear compartmentalization (i.e. localization in heterochromatin-associated toroidal structures) observed in cycling primary lymphocytes (27.Cobb B.S. Morales-Alcelay S. Kleiger G. Brown K.E. Fisher A.G. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2146-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Third, these cells are not grossly transformed and are amenable to growth controls. The first class of activation domain mutants we tested consisted of several proline point mutations in the α helical and β sheet domains of Ikaros. None of these mutants had any effect on the ability of Ikaros to transactivate the reporter (data not shown). The helical (-Ah) and β sheet (-Ab) regions of the activation domain were then respectively deleted in the context of full-length Ik1. These deletion mutations also had no effect on transactivation by Ikaros (Fig. 1A). Finally, an Ikaros mutant with the entire activation domain deleted was tested. Surprisingly, this mutant was fully capable of activation (Fig. 1A). These findings argue that the previously identified transactivation domain is not required for the activation properties of the full-length protein. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this domain is utilized in a cell- and context-specific manner. Nevertheless, in the context of our experiments, activation occurs through other means. Since no other domain of Ikaros was capable of supporting activation in detailed dissections by one-hybrid assays in mammalian cells, 3J. Koipally, unpublished observations. Ikaros may not contain a classical activation domain. Alternatively, other Ikaros activation domains, if they exist, may not be able to be identified by such assays. How might Ikaros turn on gene expression in the absence of a canonical activation domain? Our studies thus far were done using reporters containing the thymidine kinase promoter that contains binding sites for the transcription factors, Sp1 and CTF. Activation by Ikaros on these reporters may result from its cooperation (direct or indirect) with these factors. To examine whether Ikaros could transactivate in the absence of other transcriptional activators, we made use of reporters containing the TATA box from the adenovirus E1B gene (Fig. 1B, E1B TATA). We also introduced three high affinity Ikaros sites or, as a control, four Sp1 sites upstream of the E1B TATA box. These reporters were cotransfected with the Ikaros expression vector into NIH-3T3 cells and assayed for CAT activity. Ikaros did not activate from either the E1B-CAT or the Ikaros binding site-containing variant (Fig. 1B). Thus, Ikaros cannot activate a minimal promoter that consists of only a TATA box. On the other hand, the NFκB subunit p65, which can also bind to the Ikaros site, strongly activated the latter (data not shown). In striking contrast, Ikaros strongly transactivated the Sp1 E1B CAT reporter (Fig. 1B, roughly 18-fold), which has not been engineered to contain any Ikaros binding sites in the vicinity of the promoter. In addition, Ikaros was also capable of stimulating transcription of the Sp1 site-containing promoter of the tkCAT reporter even in the absence of any introduced Ikaros sites (data not shown). Two Ikaros family members, Aiolos and Helios, were also capable of similar increases in activity from these reporters (data not shown). The stimulatory effect Ikaros (and family members) has on the activity of basal transcription factors (i.e. Sp1) in the absence of any engineered binding sites can be explained in three ways. (a) Ikaros may activate transcription without binding DNA (indirect recruitment) as has been reported in some instances of activation by BRCA1 (28.Nadeau G. Boufaied N. Moisan A. Lemieux K. Cayanan C. Monteiro A. Gadreau L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For example, it may interact with other DNA-bound factors such as Sp1 to regulate transcription. (b) Ikaros may be titrating co-repressors away from the promoter (squelching), hence causing activation of reporters with or without Ikaros sites. In agreement with this hypothesis, Ikaros has been shown to interact with several co-repressors and can function as a transcriptional repressor (21.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller B. Winandy S. Veil A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 22.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23.Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. B. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). (c) Ikaros may bind to the backbone of the reporters, which incidentally have several high, medium, and low affinity Ikaros-consensus binding sites, and in this manner trans-activate reporter expression from these sites. To determine whether Ikaros mediates activation through indirect recruitment, we tested Ikaros' ability to stimulate a diverse series of activators/activation domains as Gal4 fusions. These included Gal4 DBD, Gal4-CTF, Gal4-Ikaros activation domain, Gal4-Sp1 and Gal4-Sp1N (lacking its zinc fingers). The potent repressor, Gal4-Ikaros was also examined. These heterologous proteins were transfected with the reporter 5XGal4 E1B CAT into NIH-3T3 cells in the presence or absence of Ikaros or a dimerization-defective Ikaros mutant. Ikaros expression stimulated all of the activation domains tested, albeit to different levels (Fig. 1C). Even the cryptic activation domain contained in the Gal4 DBD was further enhanced by Ikaros. Only the potent repressor, Gal4-Ik1 (and vector alone) was not activated by Ikaros (Fig. 1C). Among the activators used, only Sp1 has the potential for direct interaction with Ikaros (J. Koipally), 3J. Koipally, unpublished observations. but this interaction was not required for activation as Sp1N, an Ikaros/Sp1 interaction mutant, was also stimulated by Ikaros (Fig. 1C). In contrast to wild type Ikaros, the dimerization-defective Ikaros protein was unable to potentiate reporter gene activity (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that Ikaros' ability to stimulate transcription does not occur via a classical mechanism; Ikaros is unable to activate by itself, but rather enhances gene expression by bona fide activators. Ikaros can potentiate the functionally diverse activation domains present in Sp1 (glutamine-rich), CTF (proline-rich), and Ikaros (acidic and hydrophobic) proteins. Since none of these domains directly interact with Ikaros, its potentiation effect is not expected to be mediated through recruitment by these proteins. Instead, the enhancement of gene expression may result from co-repressor squelching or from Ikaros binding to sites associated with the reporter. Gene activation through squelching of co-repressors would not require an intact DNA binding domain unlike activation through Ikaros sites.

We have found that hyperglycemia induces the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor c-Myc in islets in several different diabetic models. To examine the possible implication of c-Myc in β-cell dysfunction, c-Myc was overexpressed in isolated rat islets using adenovirus. Adenovirus-mediated c-Myc overexpression suppressed both insulin gene transcription and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Insulin protein content, determined by immunostaining, was markedly decreased in c-Myc-overexpressing cells. In gel-shift assays c-Myc bound to the E-box in the insulin gene promoter region. Furthermore, in βTC1, MIN6, and HIT-T15 cells and primary rat islets, wild type insulin gene promoter activity was dramatically decreased by c-Myc overexpression, whereas the activity of an E-box mutated insulin promoter was not affected. In HeLa and HepG2 cells c-Myc exerted a suppressive effect on the insulin promoter activity only in the presence of NeuroD/BETA2 but not PDX-1. Both c-Myc and NeuroD can bind the E-box element in the insulin promoter, but unlike NeuroD, the c-Myc transactivation domain lacked the ability to activate insulin gene expression. Additionally p300, a co-activator of NeuroD, did not function as a co-activator of c-Myc. In conclusion, increased expression of c-Myc in β-cells suppresses the insulin gene transcription by inhibiting NeuroD-mediated transcriptional activation. This mechanism may explain some of the β-cell dysfunction found in diabetes.

Mice homozygous for the null mutation in NeuroD have a striking reduction in the number of β-cells, develop severe diabetes, and die perinatally (37.Naya F.J. Huang H. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.-J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The PDX-1-knockout mice are apancreatic and also develop fatal perinatal hyperglycemia (24.Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 37: 606-609Crossref Scopus (1573) Google Scholar), while heterozygous PDX-1-knockout mice have impaired glucose tolerance (38.Dutta S. Bonner-Weir S. Montminy M. Wright C. Nature. 1998; 392: 560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effects of c-Myc on insulin gene transcription and found that increased expression of c-Myc in β-cells suppresses the insulin gene transcription by inhibiting NeuroD-mediated transcriptional activation. Islets were isolated from pancreata of 200–250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) with collagenase digestion. Briefly, the common bile duct was cannulated and injected with 6 ml of cold M199 medium containing 1.5 mg/ml collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The islets were separated on Histopaque 1077 (Sigma) density gradient. The washed islets were picked individually under a dissecting microscope and cultured in RPMI medium (11 mm glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2at 37 °C. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center. A recombinant adenovirus expressing c-Myc was prepared using the AdEasy system (kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center) (39.He T.-C. Zhou S. DaCosta L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar). In brief, the c-Myc encoding region (kindly provided by Dr. Richard D. Palmiter, University of Washington) was cloned into the XbaI-EcoRV site of a shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV. To produce homologous recombination, 1.0 μg of linearized c-Myc-containing plasmid and 0.1 μg of the adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1, were introduced into electrocompetent Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells with electroporation (2,500 V, 200 ohms). Then the resultant plasmid was re-transformed into E. coli XL-Gold Ultracompetent Cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid was linearized with PacI and then transfected into the adenovirus packaging cell line 293 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) which was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Ten days after transfection, cell lysate was obtained from the 293 cells. The cell lysate was added to 293 cells again, and when most of the cells were killed by the adenovirus infection and detached, cell lysate was obtained again (This process was repeated three times.). Control adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) was prepared in the same manner. To determine viral titers, confluent 293 cells were infected with a 1:10,000 dilution of the final lysate containing Ad-Myc (with GFP). After an 18-h incubation, the effective titer was determined by the following formula: 107 × the average number of GFP-positive cells per field (×100 magnification), which was considered equivalent to plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml. This number was considered to be proportional to the number of infective particles in the original lysates. Isolated rat islets (∼500 islets) were infected with Ad-Myc (with GFP) or Ad-GFP (without c-Myc), using a 1-h exposure to 50 μl of the adenovirus (1 × 108 PFU/ml). One hour after infection the islets were cultured for 3 days in 3 ml of RPMI medium in 6-cm bacteriologic Petri dishes. Total RNA was extracted from islets using Trizol (Invitrogen). After quantification by spectrophotometry, 500 ng of RNA was heated at 85 °C for 3 min and then reverse-transcribed (RT) into cDNA with 160 μm dNTP, 50 ng of random hexamers, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 200 units of Superscript II RNase H−reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reactions took place for 10 min at 25 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, and 10 min at 95 °C. Polymerization reactions were performed in a Perkin-Elmer 9700 Thermocycler in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 3 μl of cDNA (20-ng RNA equivalents), 160 μm cold dNTPs, 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 10 pmol of appropriate oligonucleotide primers, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The oligonucleotide primers and cycle number used for multiplex PCR were as follows. Insulin: (forward) TCT TCT ACA CAC CCA TGT CCC, (reverse) GGT GCA GCA CTG ATC CAC, 15 cycles; GLUT2: (forward) TGG GTT CCT TCC AGT TCG, (reverse) AGG CGT CTG GTG TCG TAT G, 20 cycles; glucokinase: (forward) TGA CAG AGC CAG GAT GGA G, (reverse) TCT TCA CGC TCC ACT GCC, 25 cycles; Kir6.2: (forward) CAT GGA GAA CGG TGT GGG, (reverse) CAG ATA GGA GGT GCG GGC, 25 cycles; SUR: (forward) ATC ACG GAA GGA GGG GAG, (reverse) TTC CGG CTT GTC GAA CTC, 28 cycles; LDH: (forward) ACA GTT GTT GGG GTT GGT G, (reverse) CCG GCT CTC TCC CTC TTG, 25 cycles; c-Myc: (forward) AGT TGG ACA GTG GCA GGG, (reverse) ACA GGA TGT AGG CGG TGG, 28 cycles; PDX-1: (forward) CGG ACA TCT CCC CAT ACG, (reverse) AAA GGG AGA TGA ACG CGG, 20 cycles; NeuroD: (forward) GCA AAG GTT TGT CCC AGC, (reverse) ACG TGG AAG ACG TGG GAG, 20 cycles. The thermal cycle profile employed a 10-min denaturing step at 94 °C followed by the number of cycles and an extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. In each step, the gene products of interest were amplified with an internal control gene (rRNA, cyclophilin, α-tubulin, or TATA-binding protein (TBP)) to correct for experimental variations between samples. The oligonucleotide primers were as follows. Cyclophilin: (forward) AAC CCC ACC GTG TTC TTC, (reverse) TGC CTT CTT TCA CCT TCC C; α-tubulin: (forward) CTC GCA TCC ACT TCC CTC, (reverse) ATG CCC TCA CCC ACG TAC; TBP: (forward) ACC CTT CAC CAA TGA CTC CTA TG, (reverse) ATG ATG ACT GCA GCA AAT CGC. The primers for rRNA was purchased from AMBION (Austin, TX). The amplimers were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mmboric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried, and the amount of [α-32P]dCTP incorporated into each amplimer was measured with a PhosphorImager and quantified with the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To ensure the validity of the measurement of mRNA levels by semiquantitative-radioactive multiplex PCR, control experiments were performed using normal rat islet cDNA to show that the amount of each amplimer obtained in a multiplex PCR was independent of the presence of other primers, excluding the possibility of strong interferences between primers as we reported previously (5.Jonas J.-C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Iikova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14112-14121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In brief, the number of cycles was adjusted to be in the exponential phase of the amplification of each product, and we verified that the amount of each PCR product in a multiplex reaction increases linearly with the amount of starting cDNA (5–40-ng RNA equivalents), ensuring that changes in the ratio of PCR product to control gene product truly reflect a change in mRNA abundance of that gene relative to the control gene. Whole cell extracts were obtained from islets infected with Ad-Myc or Ad-GFP or uninfected islets. After treatment with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), supernatants were collected. Ten micrograms of cell extracts were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immun-BlotTM PVDF Membrane, Bio-Rad) using transfer buffer containing 20% methanol, 25 mm Tris base, and 192 mm glycine (300 mA, 2 h). After blocking the membranes at room temperature for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat dry milk, the membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl) containing a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and washed three times in TBS buffer with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS containing a 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) coupled to horseradish peroxidase, followed by three 10-min washings with TBS-T. Immunoreactive bands were made visible by incubation with LumiGLO (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was determined by static incubation. Isolated rat islets (50 islets) were preincubated for 30 min in 2 ml of HEPES-balanced Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and then incubated for 60 min in the same buffer supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and either 2.8 mm or 16.7 mm glucose. The insulin secreted into the medium was determined with a radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) using rat insulin as the standard. Islets were fixed for 60 min in 10% buffered formalin, enrobed in 2% agar to keep the pellet together through processing and embedding, immersed in the same fixative for another 90 min, washed, and stored in 0.1 m phosphate buffer until routine embedding in paraffin. Sections of these pellets were incubated at 4 °C overnight with guinea pig anti-insulin antibody (Linco Research) diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (1:100) (Jackson Immunochemicals). Nuclear extracts were obtained from uninfected islets and islets (∼500 islets) infected with Ad-Myc and Ad-GFP. Cells were treated with 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol); then 50 μl of high salt buffer (420 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol in hypotonic buffer) was added to the pellet, followed by 1 h of incubation at 4 °C. The supernatants were used as nuclear extracts. Two micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) at room temperature in 20 μl of reaction buffer. The reaction buffers for binding to A-box and E-box were Buffer 1 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3% Ficoll) and Buffer 2 (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 9% glycerol), respectively. The binding reaction was initiated by adding32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes. Double-stranded oligonucleotides reproducing the rat insulin gene PDX-1 and NeuroD binding region and surrounding sequences (ACG TCC TCT TAA GAC TCT AAT TAC CCT ACG T and ACG TTC TGG CCA TCT GCT GAT CCT ACG T) were used as binding probes. In some of the binding assays, anti-PDX-1 antiserum (30.Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Umayahara Y. Matsuoka T. Kaneto H. Fujitani Y. Kamada Y. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-NeuroD antibody (Santa Cruz) was added to the reaction mixture 1 h before addition of the DNA probes. After the binding reactions, samples were analyzed by separation on 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) followed by autoradiography. βTC1, HIT-T15, HepG2, and HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. MIN6 cells were grown in the same conditions except for using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 mm glucose) and 20% fetal calf serum. The cells were replated 24 h before transfection; then 1.0 μg of c-Myc expression plasmid (or the empty vectors), 1.0 μg of rat insulin II promoter-reporter (luciferase) plasmid (40.Sharma A.

Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expression plasmids (or the empty vectors), and 0.5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega, Madison, WI) were co-transfected into the cells with the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) using the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. NeuroD:c-Myc-TAD (amino acids 1–143) and c-Myc:NeuroD-TAD (amino acids 189–355) fusion plasmids were made by PCR using NeuroD and c-Myc expression plasmids as templates; the resulting clones were verified by sequencing. These plasmids were transfected as above.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4067-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) containing the 345-bp 5′-flanking sequences of the rat insulin I promoter region, and 0.5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector were co-transfected into the islets (∼100 islets) as described previously (42.Sander M. Griffen S.C. Huang J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11572-11577Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with some modification. In brief, the plasmid DNA mixture was incubated with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent, 100 μl of control adenovirus (Ad-GFP) (1 × 108 PFU/ml), and 100 μl of OPTI-MEM medium for 30 min, and then the DNA/LipofectAMINE/adenovirus mixture was then added to the cells. Forty eight hours after the transfections, cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. Preparations of cellular extracts were assayed using a luciferase assay system (Promega) and a CAT assay system (Promega). For the luciferase assay, light emission was measured with Monolight 3010 Luminometer (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). β-Galactosidase assays were performed with the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). The luciferase and CAT results were normalized with respect to transfection efficiency assessed from the results of the β-galactosidase assays. All results are presented as mean ± S.E. in three or four independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student's t test. To evaluate the possible implications of c-Myc induction in β-cell dysfunction, isolated rat pancreatic islets from Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with c-Myc-expressing adenovirus (Ad-Myc) or control adenovirus (Ad-GFP). Fig. 1A shows representative islets 3 days after infection with Ad-Myc. Total RNA was isolated 3 days after infection and used for RT-PCR followed by densitometric analyses. As shown in Fig. 1B, infection with Ad-Myc led to an increase in c-myc mRNA expression in islets as compared with uninfected cells or cells infected with Ad-GFP. Also, as shown in Fig. 1C, induction of c-Myc protein level was confirmed by Western blotting. To examine the effects of c-Myc overexpression on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, static incubations were performed using the islets exposed to Ad-Myc (or Ad-GFP). Three days after infection with Ad-Myc, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was decreased, although adenovirus infection itself (Ad-GFP) did not affect insulin secretion (Fig. 1D). To examine whether the insulin protein level is decreased by c-Myc overexpression, immunostaining for insulin was performed after infection with Ad-Myc (or Ad-GFP). Fig. 2shows representative immunostaining 3 days after infection with the adenovirus. As shown in Fig. 2A, many islet cells were c-Myc (GFP)-positive. The percentage of non-β-cells was quite low in islets after infection with either Ad-Myc or Ad-GFP (Fig. 2A,lower panel). It should be pointed out that the mantle pattern for non-β-cells is somewhat different from the more even distribution found in sections of pancreas. It appears that some mantle cells are lost and even redistributed during the process of islet isolation with collagenase and subsequent culture. Therefore, most of the infected cells are likely to be β-cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, upper panel, insulin expression was clearly detected in islets after Ad-GFP infection (right panel) but was markedly reduced after Ad-Myc infection (middle panel). These results clearly suggest that c-Myc overexpression, but not adenovirus infection itself, suppresses the insulin expression. There was no obvious difference in non-β-cell hormone staining between Ad-Myc (Fig. 2A, lower, middle panel) and Ad-GFP group (right panel), although we cannot deny the possibility that c-Myc has some less obvious effects on non-β-cells. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2B, upper panel, insulin immunostaining was markedly reduced in the cells expressing c-Myc, whereas non-β-cell hormones (glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide) were detected even in c-Myc-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Therefore, we assume that c-Myc overexpression suppresses insulin biosynthesis, leading to lower insulin content and the secretion shown in Fig. 1D. To evaluate the possible implications of c-Myc induction for β-cell dysfunction, we examined the effects of c-Myc on β-cell-associated gene expression. As shown in Fig. 3A, 3 days after the infection, total RNA was isolated and used for RT-PCR followed by densitometric analyses. The amount of insulin mRNA was remarkably decreased in the c-Myc-overexpressing islets whereas no decrease was observed in the Ad-GFP-infected cells. GLUT2 and glucokinase mRNA levels were also moderately decreased by c-Myc overexpression, whereas the expression levels of other β-cell-specific genes,Kir6.2 and SUR, did not change. Additionally, lactate dehydrogenase, which is known to be transactivated by c-Myc, was induced in islets exposed to Ad-Myc. To explore the mechanism for c-Myc-mediated reduction of insulin gene expression, we examined expression levels of NeuroD and PDX-1, both of which are very important transcription factors for insulin gene expression. As shown in Fig. 3B, the expression level of NeuroD was not affected by c-Myc overexpression. The PDX-1 expression level showed a tendency to be r"

https://openalex.org/W1975275126,"Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) acts via a dual receptor system consisting of the MET tyrosine kinase receptor and heparan sulfate or dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. In optical biosensor binding assays, competition by oligosaccharides for binding of HGF/SF to immobilized heparin showed that disaccharides failed to compete, whereas tetrasaccharides inhibited HGF/SF binding (IC(50) 8 microg/ml). The inhibitory potency of the oligosaccharides increased as their length increased by successive disaccharide units, to reach a maximum (IC(50) 1 microg/ml) at degree of polymerization (dp) 10. In binding assays, HGF/SF was found to bind directly to oligosaccharides as small as dp 4, and the binding parameters were similar for oligosaccharides of dp 4-14 (k(a) 2.2-45.3 x 10(6) m(-1) s(-1), k(d) 0.033-0.039 s(-1), and K(d) 9-16 nm). In human keratinocytes, HGF/SF stimulated DNA synthesis, and this was dependent on a sustained phosphorylation of p42/44(MAPK). In chlorate-treated and hence sulfated glycosaminoglycan-deficient HaCaT cells, the stimulation of DNA synthesis by HGF/SF was almost abolished. Heparin-derived oligosaccharides from dp 2 to dp 24 were added together with HGF/SF to chlorate-treated cells to determine the minimum size of oligosaccharides able to restore HGF/SF activity. At restricted concentrations of oligosaccharides (4 ng/ml), HGF/SF required decasaccharides, whereas at higher concentrations (100 ng/ml) even tetrasaccharides were able to partly restore DNA synthesis. The results suggest that HGF/SF binds to a tetrasaccharide and that although this is sufficient to enable the stimulation of DNA synthesis, longer oligosaccharides are more efficient, perhaps by virtue of their ability to bind more easily other molecules."

We characterize a proteolytic variant of β2-microglobulin (cleaved after Lys58) that as a trimmed form (Lys58 is removed) can be demonstrated in the circulation in patients with chronic disease. An unexpected electrophoretic heterogeneity of these two cleaved variants was demonstrated by capillary electrophoresis under physiological conditions. Each separated into a fast and a slow component while appearing homogeneous, except for a fraction of oxidized species detected by other techniques. The two components had different binding affinities for heparin and for the amyloid-specific dye Congo red, and the equilibrium between the two forms was dependent on solvent conditions. Together with analysis of the differences in circular dichroism, the results suggest that β2-microglobulin cleaved after Lys58 readily adopts two equilibrium conformations under native conditions. In the cleaved and trimmed β2-microglobulin that appears in vivo, the less populated conformation is characterized by an increased affinity for Congo red. These observations may help elucidate why β2-microglobulin polymerizes as amyloid in chronic hemodialysis and facilitate the search for means to inhibit this process. β2-Microglobulin, a small protein localized in serum and on cell surfaces, can adopt specific aggregating conformations that generate amyloid in tissues and joints as a complication to long-term hemodialysis.

Berggard I. Peterson P.A. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4811-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). β2m can be cleaved C-terminally to Lys58 (Lys58-β2m) by activated complement component C1s. In serum, the exposed Lys58residue of this cleaved molecule is subsequently removed by a carboxypeptidase B-like activity. This generates a cleaved and trimmed β2m variant called des-Lys58-β2m (β2-microglobulin cleaved C-terminally to Ser57 and lacking Lys58) (2.Nissen M.H. Roepstorff P. Thim L. Dunbar B. Fothergill J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Wild-type β2m is a one-chain protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily characterized by two antiparallel β-sheets connected by an internal disulfide bridge in a β-sandwich topology without helical structures (3.Becker J.W.

The Lys58-β2m and des-Lys58-β2m variants are disulfide-linked two-chain heterodimers (Fig. 1). des-Lys58-β2m has been demonstrated in sera from patients in hemodialysis treatment (5.Ozasa H.

In chronic renal failure, plasma concentrations of β2m may increase 10–70 times despite dialysis, and within 2 years after the onset of dialysis, about 20% of patients suffer from complications due to the formation of insoluble deposits of β2m (β2m amyloid) in tissues and joints (8.Jadoul M.

The generation of β2m amyloid may depend on a combination of a sustained increase in serum β2m concentration and subtle changes in the molecule. We and others have recently characterized how solvent and/or pH manipulations can induce variant conformations of wild-type β2-microglobulin including long-lived structured intermediates that may be on the folding pathway to amyloid (25.Chiti F.

M., Merlini, G., Ramponi, G., and Bellotti, V. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 46714–46721. Using capillary electrophoresis (CE), we were able to demonstrate the existence of two wild-type β2m conformations in equilibrium in the presence of acetonitrile and trifluoroethanol and the increased affinity of one of the conformations for the amyloid-specific dye Congo red (27.Heegaard N.H.H.

Recent data from other groups support the notion that this folding intermediate may be on the pathway to amyloid formation (25.Chiti F. Mangione P. Andreola A. Giorgetti S. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Bellotti V. Taddei N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed by CE that purified Lys58-β2m is also heterogeneous in the absence of organic solvent (27.Heegaard N.H.H. Sen J.W. Kaarsholm N.C. Nissen M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32657-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterize the Lys58-β2m and des-Lys58-β2m molecules using circular dichroism, CE, and affinity CE with heparin and Congo red. We find evidence for the existence of two conformers in cleaved β2m and demonstrate that the variant, less populated conformation has an increased affinity for heparin and Congo red. We conclude that Lys58-cleaved β2m is less conformationally constrained than wild-type β2m and exists in two distinct and stable conformations under physiological conditions. The variant conformation resembles the organic solvent-inducible conformation of wild-type β2m that may be an intermediate on the folding pathway to amyloid. β2-microglobulin capillary electrophoresis Congo red low molecular weight high pressure liquid chromatography reverse-phase mass spectrometry The sodium salt of low molecular weight (LMW) heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa (average molecular weight, 5,000) was from Calbiochem.

Chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, galactose 6-sulfate (all sodium salts) and tricine (N-((trishydroxy-methyl)methyl)glycine), electrophoresis grade, were from Sigma. HPLC-grade water and acetonitrile were from Merck. Mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies against β2m, BBM.1 (HB28) and L368 (HB149), were from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were purified by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. A marker peptide (M; acetyl-Pro-Ser-Lys-Asp-OH) was synthesized by Schafer-N (Copenhagen, Denmark). Precast polyacrylamide gels from Novex (San Diego, CA) were used for SDS-PAGE. β2m was purified from a pool of urine from uremic patients as described previously (7.Nissen M.H. Thim L. Christensen M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). β2m cleaved at Lys-58 (Lys58-β2m) and Lys58-β2m with a deleted Lys58(des-Lys58-β2m; cf. Fig. 1A) were generated by treating purified β2m with activated complement C1s in the presence or absence of a carboxypeptidase B inhibitor as described previously (2.Nissen M.H. Roepstorff P.

Total protein concentrations were estimated using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purified proteins in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, and 6.5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) were kept at −20 °C until use. A Beckman P/ACE 2050 instrument equipped with sample cooling was used for CE. Electrophoresis buffer was 0.2 m tricine/NaOH, pH 7.65, unless noted otherwise. Detection was by UV absorbance at 200 nm, and the separation tube was a 50-μm-inner diameter, uncoated, fused silica capillary of 37- or 57-cm total length with 30 or 50 cm to the detector window. Separations were carried out at 10 kV. Data were collected and processed by the Beckman system Gold software. The capillary cooling fluid was thermostatted at 25 °C. The capillary was rinsed after electrophoresis for 1 min with each of the following: 0.1 m NaOH, water, and electrophoresis buffer. The β2m samples and the marker peptide were analyzed in the dilutions given in the figure legends. In affinity experiments, various concentrations of ligands (heparin, other glycosaminoglycans, or Congo red) were added to the electrophoresis buffer from stock solutions of 5–10 mg/ml glycosaminoglycans or 0.2 mg/ml Congo red in electrophoresis buffer. In some experiments, NaCl was added at various concentrations to assess the influence of ionic strength on the binding interactions. Preparative affinity CE followed by immunodetection was performed with 1 mg/ml LMW heparin present in the electrophoresis buffer. A sample consisting of 0.3 mg/ml Lys58-β2m was injected for 12 s (corresponding to a sample volume of ∼11 s), and the instrument was programmed to change outlet vial when the two peaks of Lys58β2m that were separated well in the presence of heparin were calculated to emerge at the capillary end. Outlet collecting vials contained 25 μl of electrophoresis buffer or 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate (when collecting samples for mass spectrometry). The material was processed for immunodetection after 10 runs by dotting 8 μl of each of the two resulting fractions onto nitrocellulose. After air drying, the nitrocellulose was blocked with 2% Tween 20 for 5 min and reacted with rabbit anti-β2m (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark; code no. A0072) at a dilution of 1:500 for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, bound primary antibody was visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled swine anti-rabbit Ig (Dako; code no. D0306) at 1:1,000 for 1 h at room temperature followed by nitro blue tetrazolium staining. Protein G-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was washed in electrophoresis buffer diluted 1:10 in water, and 40 μl of 1:1 suspensions were transferred to 500-μl microcentrifuge tubes. Monoclonal antibodies against β2m (BBM.1 and L368) were diluted to 2 mg/ml and 4 μl of each together with 80 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were added to separate tubes with the washed protein G-Sepharose. After 10 min at room temperature, the matrices were washed twice with 450 μl of dilute electrophoresis buffer, and 2 μl of β2m sample (wild-type or variants) (0.2 mg/ml) and marker peptide (0.03 mg/ml) were added to individual tubes containing bound antibodies or control tubes without antibody. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the matrices were resuspended and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 2 min. Aliquots of the supernatants were finally analyzed by CE. Peak appearance times (t) were equalized with respect to variations in electro-osmotic flow and shifts in buffer dielectric constant from run to run by subtracting the inverse appearance time of the added marker peptide from the inverse β2m peak appearance times. This figure is proportional to the electrophoretic mobility (31.Shimura K. Kasai K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Triplicate sets of control runs consistently had a relative S.D. of the normalized 1/t below 0.5%. Mobility shifts were then expressed as the difference between the normalized 1/t values at various concentrations (c) of additive. Linearization of the plot for binding constant estimation took place according to the equation: Δ(1/t) = Δ(1/t)max −Kd(Δ(1/t)/c) (31.Shimura K. Kasai K. Anal.

Binding constants were also derived from direct nonlinear curve fits in plots of Δ(1/t) as a function of c(GraphPadPRISM, v. 2.01; GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). β2m masses were verified by MALDI-MS on a Voyager Elite instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) with delayed ion extraction using the dried-droplet method with sinnapic acid as sample matrix (33.Kussmann M.

RP-HPLC separation of individual components of wild-type β2m and Lys58-β2m took place at 1 ml/min using a 60 min linear gradient of 28–49% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid on an analytical C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) from Vydac (Hesperia, CA). Peaks were detected at 210 and 280 nm, collected manually, and dried down in a vacuum evaporator. The material for MS from capillary electrophoresis was collected during 44 repetitive runs in electrophoresis buffer without additions using a protein concentration of 0.6 mg/ml. Before MS, these samples were micropurified to remove buffer salts by passage through a reverse-phase microcolumn prepared by placing a Poros 50 R2 matrix (PerSeptive Biosystems) in an Eppendorf GelLoader tip with an extended outlet (33.Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Haebel S. Rossel-Larsen M. Gobom J. Mirgorodskaya E. Kroll-Kristensen A. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon Dichrograph mark V purged with nitrogen. The CD signal was calibrated with (+)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid (1 mg/ml; Merck) in a 1-mm cell, assuming an ε of 2.36 m−1 cm−1at 291.0 nm. The ratio between the negative band at 191.5 nm and the positive band at 291.0 nm was in the range of 2.07–2.10. A spectral bandwidth of 1.0 and 2.0 nm in the near and far UV, respectively, was used. Samples were contained in cylindrical cells with nominal path length of 0.005–0.5 cm, and the actual path length of the 0.005- and the 0.010-cm cells was determined interferometrically. For all CD measurements, the total optical density of sample, solvent, and cell was <1.0. All measurements were made at room temperature (24 ± 1 °C). Spectra (180–250, 225–250, and 240–325 nm) were collected at a final β2m/Lys58-β2m/des-Lys58-β2m concentration of about 1 mg/ml (85 μm) in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.1. Final smoothed CD spectra, averaged from at least three scans, were obtained after baseline subtraction. The CD is expressed as Δε (m−1 cm−1) normalized to the molar concentration of peptide bond. The structure of β2-microglobulin and variants thereof generated by limited proteolysis is shown in Fig. 1A. The three purified components were analyzed by CD, and the results (Fig. 1B) indicate that significant differences in the conformation of β2m are induced in response to cleavage of the molecule. The differences in the spectra in the near-UV region (240–325 nm) suggest changes of the environment of aromatic side chains, i.e. changes in the tertiary folding of the β2m chain. The two cleaved forms clearly deviate from the fingerprint of the wild-type β2m structure in this region of the spectrum. The far-UV region (180–250 nm) provides quantitative information on the overall secondary structure content of the protein (34.Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 161-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and differences in the spectra in this region for the three forms are also observed (Fig. 5). The characteristic spectrum of wild-type β2m is compatible with ∼50% β-structures (strands and turns), 50% random structure, and practically no helix structures as reported previously (4.Okon M. Bray P. Vucelic D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8906-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27.Heegaard N.H.H. Sen J.W. Kaarsholm N.C. Nissen M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32657-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The changes in the far-UV spectrum of the cleaved forms, most pronounced for the Lys58-β2m species, are similar to the changes in the CD spectra of wild-type β2m obtained in 10–15% trifluoroethanol or 20–30% acetonitrile where there is a mixture of the native fold and a solvent-induced species with less β-structure and more helix structure (27.Heegaard N.H.H. Sen J.W. Kaarsholm N.C. Nissen M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32657-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus the far-UV spectra of Fig. 5 are compatible with the presence of a mixture of differently folded species in the Lys58-β2m preparation. Although it is not possible to quantitatively correct for their individual contributions to the spectra, the observations indicate that the two structures are substantially different. When the three purified β2m species were separated by CE, more than one peak was observed in both the Lys58-β2m and the des-Lys58-β2m preparations (Fig. 2B), i.e. a smaller and more slowly migrating peak appeared after the main peaks. This was most pronounced in the Lys58-β2m preparation (Fig. 2B, 2), where this slow fraction constituted ∼25% of the total sample independently on the sample dilution from 1.3 to 0.13 mg/ml (data not shown). Wild-type β2m (Fig. 2B, 1) appeared homogenous in the CE analysis, and none of the samples were heterogeneous by SDS-PAGE except for faint bands around Mr 25,000 (Fig. 2A). However, it was noted that the cleaved forms migrated more slowly in SDS-PAGE than wild-type β2m. Two different monoclonal antibodies against human β2m (L368 and BBM.1) immobilized on protein G-Sepharose removed the two peaks of des-Lys58-β2m and Lys58-β2m as well as the single peak representing wild-type β2m when added to samples before CE (results not shown). This argued against the possibility that impurities or other 200 nm-absorbing components in the sample aside from β2m molecules contributed to the observed peaks. Also, both peaks in both the des-Lys58-β2m and the Lys58-β2m samples absorbed at 280 nm and were degraded by trypsin treatment (results not shown). Masses of the proteins measured by MALDI-MS were within 0.02% of the theoretical masses of the β2m forms based on their amino acid sequences. No evidence of dimers or higher order polymers was seen in the mass spectra. However, two species in both the β2m and the Lys58-β2m preparations differing by ∼16 mass units (16.8 and 18.5) were separated by RP-HPLC using a shallow gradient (Fig. 3). The higher mass form (about 25% of the total amount) eluted earlier than the main component. In the MS analyses, some dissociation of the two polypeptide chains of the Lys58-β2m heterodimer was observed (data not shown). The A-chain (residues 1–58) was identified by its close agreement with its theoretical mass in both RP-HPLC purified peaks. The 16-unit mass addition thus resided in the B-chain that differed by this number in the two purified peaks. The observations suggest that the difference between the two HPLC-resolvable components was due to molecules with an oxidized C-terminal methionine residue (Met99). This would add 16 mass units to the molecular mass. However, it was unlikely that the two peaks of Lys58-β2m observed in the CE analysis (Fig. 3B, inset) corresponded to the heterogeneity revealed by the RP-HPLC analysis (Fig. 3B). First, wild-type β2m had the same amount of the putative oxoform in the HPLC analysis as Lys58-β2m but did not display heterogeneity in the CE analysis (Fig. 3A, inset). Second, when the two peaks that were resolved by RP-HPLC were collected separately and reanalyzed by CE, both components gave two peaks exactly as observed in the Lys58-β2m starting material (data not shown). To collect and immunochemically characterize each of the CE-resolved fast (f) and slow (s) peaks of Lys58-β2m, it was necessary to enhance their spacing. We found that addition to the electrophoresis buffer of heparin or heparan sulfate, highly sulfated glucosaminoglycans that are found associated with all types of amyloid (16.Kisilevsky R. Snow A. Med. Hypotheses. 1988; 26: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17.Snow A.D. Willmer J. Kisilevsky R. Lab. Invest. 1987; 57: 687-698PubMed Google Scholar), substantially increased the selectivity of the separation (Fig. 4). Heparin prolonged the appearance time of the s peak, indicating complex formation between heparin and the Lys58-β2m s species. Using this approach for preparative CE, it was possible to separately collect enough of the components of Lys58-β2m to probe them with anti-β2m antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4, material from both peaks subsequently reacted with a polyclonal anti-β2m antibody. This confirmed that β2m was present in both peaks; thus, the apparent heterogeneity of the sample was not due to contaminating, unrelated proteins. When collecting the two peaks together in CE runs without a buffer modifier, the only components that were detectable by MS were the unmodified and the oxidized Lys58-β2m species that were observed in the RP-HPLC analyses (Fig. 3). The heparin binding activity of the two Lys58-β2m species was quantitated by a series of affinity CE experiments (Fig. 5). As noted in the preparative affinity CE experiments (Fig. 4), the changes in the migration profile with heparin in the electrophoresis buffer were most pronounced for the s component of Lys58-β2m that shifted to longer appearance times as compared with the f component and with the marker peptide (Fig. 5A, M). The longer peak appearance times in the presence of heparin indicate that the s component of Lys58-β2m reversibly binds to the anionic heparin ligand during electrophoresis and thereby get a net increase in electrophoretic mobility, leading to a retardation of this peak. The predominant peak (f) was affected in the same way, but only at the highest concentration of heparin (Fig. 5A). The consistent shift of the whole s peak with increasing heparin additions to the buffer shows that it represents a homogeneous population of molecules with respect to heparin binding affinity. The migration shifts observed after the addition of LMW heparin and heparan sulfate in similar affinity CE experiments were comparable, whereas smaller shifts were seen with corresponding milligram/milliliter concentrations of chondroitin sulfate (data not shown). No changes in the peak patterns were observed with additions of up to 0.5 mg/ml (1.8 mm) galactose-6-sulfate (data not shown) or 0.5 mg/ml dextran sulfate (data not shown). Decreasing magnitudes of migration shifts were observed with increasing ionic strength of the electrophoresis buffer (data not shown). Migration shift data are summarized in Fig. 5B. The total LMW heparin concentration was used for the value of c, the concentration of ligand. The des-Lys58-β2m sample showed binding, especially of the minor s peak, but showed negligible migration shifts with heparin (data not shown) and is not included in the data. The data obtained with β2m and Lys58-β2m (Fig. 5B) could be fitted (r2 > 0.99) to a one site binding hyperbola. The inset of Fig. 5B shows the linearized data. The slopes of the lines are a measure of heparin affinity. Whereas the affinities for heparin of wild-type β2m and the fast component of Lys58-β2m are very similar (Kd = 1.6 and 2.2 mm, respectively), the slow Lys58-β2m component has a higher affinity (Kd = 0.6 mm). We found that Lys58-β2m samples that had been subjected to RP-HPLC purification and were resolubilized in water almost completely converted to the slow component detected by CE. Over time, this distribution slowly reverted to the normal distribution of the two forms with the fast peak as the major species (Fig. 6). With addition of the amyloid-specific dye CR to the electrophoresis buffer, we used CE to assess the binding to the cleaved β2m variant des-Lys58-β2m that circulates in chronic disease (Fig. 7). Whereas both components of this molecule bind heparin poorly, it was readily observed that the s component of des-Lys58-β2m interacted more strongly with CR than the f species. In addition, a late peak (marked with an asterisk, Fig. 7), which we interpret as representing the CR-des-Lys58-β2m complex, increased proportionally with the concentration of CR. This late complex was absent in Congo red affinity CE analyses of marker or wild-type β2m alone (data not shown). Because of the stable complex formation, it was not possible to calculate a binding constant for the interaction between the s conformation of des-Lys58-β2m and Congo red based on peak migration shifts, but complex formation was clearly already detectable at 1–2 μm CR (Fig. 7). The CE and CD analyses of β2m variants generated by limited proteolysis strongly suggest that these molecules exist in two distinct conformations that are in equilibrium at neutral pH in physiological buffer. Although the β2m variants (as well as wild-type β2m) contain both unmodified and modified molecules (probably oxidized on the C-terminal Met99residue), the heterogeneity demonstrated by CE was not caused by a fraction of oxidized molecules. Due to the resolution of the CE analysis and the higher affinity of one of the conformations for heparin, the distribution between the two conformations was readily quantitated under different conditions, and we found that the less abundant s conformation is favored under more hydrophobic conditions. We recently found that such conditions induce a loss of native conformation and the emergence of a specific conformational variant or a partly structured intermediate of wild-type β2m as well (27.Heegaard N.H.H. Sen J.W. Kaarsholm N.C. Nissen M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32657-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Studies of wild-type human β2m in solution using NMR techniques (4.Okon M. Bray P. Vucelic D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8906-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and three-dimensional structure elucidation based on x-ray crystallography of β2m in complex with major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (35.Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar) show that β2m at pH 5.4–8.0 is a pure β-sheet protein that assumes a defined, moderately tightly packed structure of two antiparallel β-sheets formed around the Cys25-Cys80 disulfide bridge. Lys58is part of a 5-residue loop between β-strands that is either very rigid or relatively slowly fluctuating between two or more structures (4.Okon M. Bray P. Vucelic D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8906-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). β2m contains no obvious linear consensus sequences (clusters of basic amino acids) (36.Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for heparin binding, but it is conceivable that a break in the strained loop between Lys58 and Asp59 with the possibility of rotation around the disulfide bond may facilitate alternative conformations, one of which has an increased binding affinity for heparin. The consequences of non-native conformations for β2-microglobulin function in cellular immunity remain to be elucidated, but a changed conformation is likely to influence protein-protein interactions between β2-microglobulin and the major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain and thereby influence the presentation of major histocompatibility complex-associated peptides. Conformational changes are supported by the observations of CE heterogeneity and by the changes in the CD spectra as well as by the overall different mobility in SDS-PAGE of the variants as compared with native β2m (Refs. 2.Nissen M.H. Roepstorff P. Thim L. Dunbar B. Fothergill J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 7.Nissen M.H. Thim L. Christensen M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; Fig. 2A). Only by CE, however, is it possible to quantitatively separate the two species. The discovery that β2m and its proteolytic variant Lys58-β2m are able to bind heparin is interesting because many of the peptides and proteins that have been identified as major components of different types of amyloid have been shown to bind heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate (37.Lyon A.W. Anastassiades T. Kisilevsky R. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 20: 1108-1113PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Watson D.J. Lander A.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

Amyloid-like material has been observed in vitro after simply mixing wild-type β2m with heparan sulfate and/or serum amyloid P component (41.Ono K. Uchino F. Nephron. 1994; 66: 404-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Kd values for the interactions with heparin estimated in the present study are maximum values because the total LMW heparin concentration was used in the plots. It is not known whether a specific subfraction of heparin (heparin is heterogenous with respect to chain length, sulfation, and disaccharide composition (29.Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 60: 443-475Google Scholar, 42.Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar)) is responsible for binding. However, the binding is weak and ionic strength-dependent, i.e. involves electrostatic interactions. The presence of glycosaminoglycans in β2m amyloid is an indication of the abnormal conformation and/or polymerization of the deposited wild-type β2m (14.Gorevic P.D. Munoz P.C. Casey T.T. DiRaimondo C.R. Stone W.J. Prelli F.C. Rodrigues M.M. Poulik M.D. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7908-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19.Campistol J.M. Bernard D. Papastoitsis G. Sole M. Kasirsky J. Skinner M. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1262-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A key finding of the present study is that Congo red binds specifically and strongly to the conformational variant existing under native conditions in des-Lys58-β2m. CR resembles heparin/heparan sulfate in being a sulfated molecule with known affinity for amyloid. Taken together, however, our results indicate that anionic groups are not responsible for the binding of CR to the des-Lys58-β2m s conformer. The CE and CD data agree with the notion that the des-Lys58-β2m variant conformation is similar to the organic solvent-induced variant conformation of wild-type β2m that also displays considerably increased affinity for CR and that may be an intermediate on the pathway to insoluble amyloid formation (27.Heegaard N.H.H.

A fraction of cleaved β2m may thus be able to present differently structured intermediates and thereby instruct wild-type β2m to malfold and precipitate as amyloid. Although many steps in this process remain to be elucidated, the approach presented here will be helpful in further analyses of the conformational intermediates and oligo-molecular complexes that together form amyloid or amyloid precursors and thus in the discovery of means to inhibit these processes.

https://openalex.org/W2046488084,"The essential splicing factor ASF/SF2 activates or represses splicing depending on where on the pre-mRNA it binds. We have shown previously that ASF/SF2 inhibits adenovirus IIIa pre-mRNA splicing by binding to an intronic repressor element. Here we used MS2-ASF/SF2 fusion proteins to show that the second RNA binding domain (RBD2) is both necessary and sufficient for the splicing repressor function of ASF/SF2. Furthermore, we show that the completely conserved SWQDLKD motif in ASF/SF2-RBD2 is essential for splicing repression. Importantly, this heptapeptide motif is unlikely to be directly involved in RNA binding given its position within the predicted structure of RBD2. The activity of the ASF/SF2-RBD2 domain in splicing was position-dependent. Thus, tethering RBD2 to the IIIa intron resulted in splicing repression, whereas RBD2 binding at the second exon had no effect on IIIa splicing. The splicing repressor activity of RBD2 was not unique to the IIIa pre-mRNA, as binding of RBD2 at an intronic position in the rabbit beta-globin pre-mRNA also resulted in splicing inhibition. Taken together, our results suggest that ASF/SF2 encode distinct domains responsible for its function as a splicing enhancer or splicing repressor protein."
https://openalex.org/W2111739312,"Factor VIIIa consists of three subunits designated A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2. The isolated A2 subunit possesses limited cofactor activity in stimulating factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X. This activity is markedly enhanced by the A1 subunit (inter-subunit Kd = 1.8 μm). The C-terminal region of A1 subunit (residues 337–372) is thought to represent an A2-interactive site. This region appears critical to factor VIIIa, because proteolysis at Arg336 by activated protein C or factor IXa is inactivating. A truncated A1 (A1336) showed similar affinity for A2 subunit (Kd = 0.9 μm) and stimulated its cofactor activity to ∼50% that observed for native A1. However, A1336 was unable to reconstitute factor VIIIa activity in the presence of A2 and A3-C1-C2 subunits. Fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein (Fl)-FFR-factor IXa was differentially altered by factor VIIIa trimers containing either A1 or A1336. Fluorescence energy transfer demonstrated that, although Fl-A1336/A3-C1-C2 bound acrylodan-A2 with similar affinity as the native dimer, an increased inter-fluorophore separation was observed. These results indicate that the C-terminal region of A1 appears necessary to properly orient A2 subunit relative to factor IXa in the cofactor rather than directly stimulate A2 and elucidate the mechanism for cofactor inactivation following cleavage at this site.

Factor VIII circulates as a partial proteolyzed protein containing a heavy chain (A1-A2-B domains) and a light chain (A3-C1-C2 domains), which are held together by a metal ion-dependent linkage. This procofactor is activated by thrombin, converting the dimer into a trimer composed of the A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 subunits (4.Lollar P. Parker C.G.

The role of factor VIIIa is to bind factor IXa, generating the phospholipid-dependent intrinsic factor Xase complex, which increases the kcat for factor Xa formation by several orders of magnitude compared with factor IXa alone (10.van Dieijen G.

At least two interactive sites have been identified for the enzyme-cofactor interaction. A high affinity, surface proximal site is likely formed by residues contained in the A3 domain and light chain of factors VIIIa and IXa, respectively, whereas a weaker affinity interaction involves residues localized to the A2 subunit of the cofactor and the serine protease domain (see Ref. 11.Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Blood. 1998; 92: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a review). Recent studies have shown that modulation of factor IXa by the isolated A2 subunit enhances the kcat for factor Xa activation by ∼100-fold (12.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and that the isolated A1 subunit synergizes this effect (13.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. Mastri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15401-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This A1-dependent increase in A2 cofactor activity (>15-fold) did not result from direct interaction with factor IXa but rather altered the interaction of A2 subunit with the protease. Little information is available regarding sites of interaction between the A1 and A2 subunits of factor VIIIa. Earlier studies have suggested that the C-terminal acidic region of A1 subunit (residues 337–372) represented an A2-interactive site and was involved in A2 retention following thrombin activation of the cofactor (14.Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Proteolysis at this site correlates with inactivation of factor VIIIa. The mechanism for this inactivation is poorly understood, but results are consistent with the loss of the C-terminal region reducing the affinity for the A2 subunit (18.Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M.

We observed that A1336 showed similar affinity for A2 and exhibited near native-like activity in stimulating activity associated with the isolated A2 subunit. In contrast, the A1336/A3-C1-C2 dimer, formed either by the replacement of A1 with A1336 followed by reassociation with A3-C1-C2 or by APC-catalyzed cleavage of the native A1/A3-C1-C2, yielded a dimer form that was functionally inactive following the addition of the A2 subunit. Fluorescence anisotropy and resonance energy transfer analyses indicated association of A2 with the A1336/A3-C1-C2 dimer. However, the resultant trimer appeared to possess an altered orientation of A2 relative to the dimer and factor IXa. Therefore, although residues 337–372 are largely dispensable for a functional interaction between the isolated A1 and A2 subunits, this region appears critical for proper orientation of A2 subunit relative to factor IXa in the factor VIIIa trimer. These observations elucidate the mechanism for factor IXa- and APC-catalyzed inactivation of the cofactor. Recombinant factor VIII preparations were generous gifts from Bayer Corp. and the Genetics Institute. The monoclonal antibody specific for the N terminus of A1 was a gift from Dr. James Brown. The reagents α-thrombin, factor IXaβ, factor X, and factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories); bovine and human APC (Hematology Technologies); and the chromogenic substrates S-2765 and S-2366 (Kabi-Pharmacia) were purchased from the indicated vendors. Fluorescence reagents acrylodan and fluorescein 5-maleimide were obtained from Molecular Probes and Fl-FFR-IXa from Molecular Innovations. Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. synthesized the synthetic peptide corresponding to the A1 subunit region 337–372. All other reagents were purchased from Pierce or Sigma Chemical Co. The A1 and the A2 subunits were isolated from recombinant factor VIII. Purified heavy chain (∼7 mg), prepared as previously described (20.Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was incubated with thrombin (0.02 μm) for 2.5 h at room temperature in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1m NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.025% Tween 20. Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone was added to inactivate thrombin prior to purification. The cleaved heavy chain was fractionated by fast-protein liquid chromatography using a Pharmacia Hi-Trap Heparin column. The A1 subunit was collected in the unbound fraction and A2 was eluted at ∼0.3 m NaCl using a linear salt gradient (0.1 m to 1.0 m). The A1 subunit was further purified by fast-protein liquid chromatography using a Mono-Q column where it eluted at ∼0.4 m NaCl (12.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The isolated A1 and the A2 subunits were dialyzed into a low salt buffer and stored at −80 °C. Acrylodan-labeled A2, used for fluorescence energy transfer experiments, was prepared as described earlier (21.Koszelak M.E. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27137-27144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine APC was added to the purified A1 in a 1:20 (mol/mol) ratio in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% Tween 20, and reacted overnight at 22 °C. A1336 was separated from the cleaved 337–372 peptide and APC as follows. Approximately 100 μl of Q-Sepharose resin, equilibrated in the above buffer, was added to the A1 cleavage reaction and incubated for 30 min. The solution was spun in a microcentrifuge to yield the supernatant containing the truncated A1 subunit. The resin bound the peptide fragment as well as APC as determined by SDS-PAGE of eluted material. A chromogenic assay revealed <0.2% residual APC activity was present in the purified A1336. Factor VIII (1 μm) was cleaved with thrombin in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1m NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.025% Tween 20 to form factor VIIIa (5.Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A2 subunit was removed from the A1/A3-C1-C2 subunit using a Mono-S column (22.Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and residual A2 was eliminated using an R8B12-Affi-Gel 10 column (23.O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (1 μm) was dialyzed into 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20 and applied to a 1.5-ml SP-Sepharose column and eluted with 1.0 m NaCl in buffer. The purified A1/A3-C1-C2 was labeled with fluorescein 5-malemide as described previously (21.Koszelak M.E. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27137-27144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human APC was added to a portion of the purified Fl-A1/A3-C1-C2 in a ratio of 1:20 (mol/mol) and incubated overnight at 22 °C to generate Fl-A1336/A3-C1-C2. APC was inactivated following addition of a 2-fold molar excess of EGR-chloromethyl ketone, as judged by reaction with the chromogenic substrate S-2366. The rate of conversion of factor X to Xa was monitored using a purified system (24.Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The A2 subunit was reacted with indicated levels of A1 or A1336 and incubated with 5 nm factor IXa in the presence of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, ∼50 mm NaCl (this salt concentration was contributed from the reactants), 5 mmCaCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 10 μg/ml phospholipid vesicles for 10 min at room temperature. The reactions were initiated with the addition of 300 nm factor X. At appropriate times, 5-μl aliquots were removed and added to tubes containing 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, to quench the reactions. Rates of factor Xa generation were determined by the addition of the chromogenic substrate, S-2765 (0.46 mm). Reactions were read on a Molecular Devices Vmax microtiter plate reader set at 405 nm. Factor VIIIa was reconstituted in a two-step reaction. In the first step, the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer was formed by reacting A3-C1-C2 (500 nm) and variable levels of A1 or A1336 overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, ∼25 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 20. Subsequently, the dimer solution was diluted 10-fold and factor VIIIa was reconstituted following addition of A2 subunit (20 nm) in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.01% Tween 20, and 200 μg/ml BSA. Reactions were conducted at room temperature, and factor VIIIa activity was determined after 15 min by a one-stage clotting assay using factor VIII-deficient plasma (25.Casillas G. Simonetti C. Pavlovsky A. Coagulation. 1971; 4: 107-111Google Scholar). Anisotropy values were determined using an Amico-Bowman Series 2 spectrometer with the band pass at 4 nm and the lamp set at 950 V. Reactions were run at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, ∼50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, and 100 μg/ml BSA with 50 μm phospholipid vesicles, 100 nmFl-FFR-IXa, 600 nm A1(A1336)/A3-C1-C2, and 600 nm A2 in the presence or absence of 600 nmfactor X. The polarizers were arranged in an l-format, and the reactions were read in Starna quartz cuvettes. The samples were excited at 495 nm, and the emission was recorded at 520 nm for 2 s at each polarizer position. The anisotropy values were the result of 10 readings and were calculated automatically by the instrument. 100 nm Ac-A2 and varying amounts of Fl-A1/A3-C1-C2 or Fl-A1336/A3-C1-C2 were reconstituted for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.01% Tween 20, and 200 μg/ml BSA. Fluorescence measurements were obtained using the Amico-Bowman spectrometer employing the reaction conditions described above. The reconstitution reactions were excited at 395 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded between 420 and 550 nm. Scans were run at 3 nm/s and were averaged from three readings. The Ac-A2 spectrum was corrected for buffer, background from the (Fl)-dimer, and peptide, when necessary. Percent donor quenching was calculated at λ = 472 nm. Percent quenching as a function of Ac-A2 concentration was plotted, and the data were fitted to the quadratic equation by nonlinear least-squares regression (26.Wakabayashi H. Koszelak M.E. Mastri M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10293-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was run on either 10% or 15% gels, according to the procedure of Laemmli (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was conducted on a Bio-Rad mini-gel apparatus set at 200 V for 50 min. Gels were stained with the Pierce GelCode Blue or GelCode SilverSNAP stains. Alternatively, the protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad mini-transblot apparatus overnight at 50 V in a buffer containing 10 mm CAPS, pH 11.0, and 10% (v/v) methanol. The protein was probed using the 58.12 monoclonal antibody, specific for the N terminus of the A1 subunit. A goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used as the secondary antibody, and the signal was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). In earlier studies, the isolated A1 and A2 subunits of factor VIIIa were prepared following proteolysis of recombinant factor VIII by thrombin (12.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. Mastri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15401-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, subsequent subunit purification yielded relatively low levels of A2 subunit due to continued association with the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer. Furthermore, the possibility for contamination of this subunit by low levels of dimer is undesirable due to the potential to regenerate factor VIIIa, thereby yielding significant levels of background activity to that attributed to A2 subunit alone. Recently, we showed that the isolated factor VIII heavy chain, which is efficiently cleaved by thrombin to yield A1 and A2 subunits, has no endogenous cofactor activity (20.Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, purified factor VIII heavy chain was employed as a source for the A1 and A2 subunits. Separation of the subunits was facilitated by purification using a heparin chromatographic support, based upon recent identification of a high affinity heparin site within the A2 domain (28.Sarafanov A.G. Ananyeva N.M. Shima M. Saenko E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11970-11979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Purified heavy chain was processed to prepare the isolated subunits as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown by gel electrophoresis, both subunits exhibited high degrees of purity (Fig. 1A) and were obtained in reasonable yield (∼700 μg and ∼300 μg of A1 and A2 subunits, respectively). Compared with earlier preparations of the subunits, yields were two to three times higher using the heavy chain as starting material. Subsequent reaction of isolated A1 subunit with bovine APC yielded the A1336 truncation. Western blot analysis using an anti-A1 domainal monoclonal antibody specific for the N-terminal sequence revealed quantitative cleavage at Arg336 (Fig. 1B). The cleaved A1 subunit was purified using Q-Sepharose resin as described under “Materials and Methods.” The A1336 failed to bind to the resin and was recovered in the supernatant following centrifugation, whereas the acidic C-terminal peptide product as well as APC were adsorbed by the resin (Fig. 1C). Residual APC activity in the purified A1336sample was less than 0.2% of that present in the unfractionated reaction. In earlier reports, we showed that A2 subunit markedly increased the rate of factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X to Xa (12.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and that addition of the isolated A1 subunit further increased this activity by >10-fold (13.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. Mastri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15401-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Comparison of the capacity for native and truncated A1 subunits to stimulate cofactor activity associated with A2 subunit is shown in Fig. 2. Reactions contained 400 nm A2 subunit and indicated levels of the A1 subunit forms, which were preincubated in the presence of factor IXa prior to initiation of the reaction with factor X. Increasing concentrations of either form of A1 stimulated A2 activity and this effect was saturable with respect to added A1. Maximal rates of factor Xa generation of ∼15 and ∼8 min−1 were obtained at saturating levels of A1 and A1336, respectively. Negligible levels of activity were obtained in the absence of A2 subunit (data not shown) and were corrected for prior to curve fitting. The value obtained at saturating A1 was equivalent to an earlier reported value (13.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. Mastri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15401-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although the -fold stimulation compared with A2 activity alone is several times greater. This effect resulted from the somewhat lower factor Xa-generating activity observed with the isolated A2 alone (∼0.1 min−1using 400 nm A2) compared with the value obtained for an equivalent A2 concentration observed in an earlier report (∼0.4 min−1 (12.Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)), possibly reflecting a more highly purified preparation of the subunit. Interestingly, the calculated affinities for the inter-subunit interactions (Kd values of 1.8 and 0.9 μm for A2 with native and truncated A1 forms, respectively) were similar, representing binding energy values of 7.8 and 8.2 kcal mol−1, respectively. Taken together, these kinetic and binding parameters indicate that the C-terminal region of A1 is not necessary for either its association with A2 subunit or significant stimulation of A2 activity when examined using the isolated subunits. Based on the observation that the truncated A1 yielded ∼50% the A2 stimulatory activity of the intact A1 subunit, an experiment was preformed to determine whether residues 337–372 directly contributed to the activity generated. This analysis was undertaken, in part, based on earlier results from our laboratory suggesting this peptide as interacting with A2 subunit (14.Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A2 subunit-dependent stimulation of factor IXa was examined in the absence and presence of a synthetic peptide representing A1 residues 337–372 (Fig. 3). Results from this analysis showed no enhancement of activity by the peptide, but rather showed that high concentration of the peptide inhibited the rate of factor Xa generation. Similarly, peptide inhibited A2-dependent activity in the presence of A1 and A1336 subunits. These results indicated that the C-terminal A1 acidic peptide neither directly stimulates A2 nor synergistically enhances the activity of A1336 directed toward the A2 subunit. The mechanism for the observed inhibition of this peptide is not currently understood but does appear to be dependent upon the presence of the A2 subunit, consistent with an interaction between the peptide and A2 subunit (14.Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23.O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that the peptide had no effect on factor Xa activity directed toward the chromogenic substrate (data not shown). Although cleavage of the A1 subunit at Arg336 has minimal effects on the A1-dependent stimulation of A2 subunit activity, cleavage of factor VIIIa at this site by APC (29.Lu D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17.Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) abolishes activity. Therefore, we investigated this apparent disparity following reconstitution of factor VIIIa with either native or truncated A1 forms. The A1(A1336)/A3-C1-C2 dimer was formed following reaction of the A3-C1-C2 subunit (500 nm) and varying amounts of either A1 or A1336 run in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the dimer solution was diluted 10-fold and reacted with A2 subunit, and reconstituted factor VIIIa activity was determined using a one-stage clotting assay. Results from this experiment show high levels (∼200 units/ml) of factor VIIIa activity were obtained at saturating levels of native A1. The specific activity of the reconstituted product was >60 units/μg reconstituted factor VIIIa based upon the concentration of the limiting reactant (20 nm A2 subunit). However, little if any activity was observed for factor VIIIa reconstituted using the A1336 form. The failure to obtain factor VIIIa activity was consistent with earlier results examining the effect of cleavage at the Arg336 site. Because the ability of the cleaved A1 to bind the A2 subunit as judged by the functional assay was established above, these results suggest that the interaction of A1336 with A2 is impaired in the formation of a functional VIIIa trimer. An alternate explanation, that A1336 was defective in its association with A3-C1-C2 subunit, was addressed using a competition assay. The addition of increasing amounts of A1336 into the reconstitution reactions containing fixed concentrations of A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits effectively competed with the A1 in binding A3-C1-C2 based on ∼50% inhibition of reconstituted factor VIIIa activity (following addition of A2 subunit) at equimolar concentrations of the two A1 forms (results not shown). This result indicated that the C terminus of A1 was not required in the formation of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer. The observation that A1336 failed to reconstitute factor VIIIa activity yet retained high affinity and stimulatory activity toward isolated A2 subunit suggested two possible reasons for this disparity. One alternative may reflect a failure of A2 subunit to bind the A1336/A3-C1-C2 dimer. On the other hand, A2 subunit binding the truncated dimer may alter its subsequent capacity to modulate the IXa active site, possibly due to the constraints imposed in the surface-bound trimer that are not present in the interaction of IXa with isolated A1 and A2 subunits. These alternatives were examined using the fluorescence-based assays described below. Constraints on the rotational mobility of a fluorophore near the active site of factor IXa imposed by the dimer forms in the absence and presence of A2 subunit and factor X were asses"

Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). A topological model, describing the organization of the protein, in terms of 10 transmembrane spans M1–10 and three cytosolic domains, connected to the membrane-embedded part by a stalk of putative helices (2.Brandl C.J.

The function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase is to mediate the active uptake of 2 mol of Ca2+ from the myoplasm for each mole of ATP hydrolyzed (5.Inesi G. Annu. Rev.

During Ca2+ transport the protein undergoes a series of conformational changes, which involve phosphorylation by ATP, the intramembranous binding of two calcium ions, and their subsequent transport to the lumenal side and dephosphorylation of the protein. Binding of Ca2+ at the cytosolic sites of the ATPase, measured in the absence of nucleotide, also occurs with a stoichiometry of 2 Ca2+ per Ca2+-ATPase polypeptide chain and with a positive cooperativity which has been interpreted in terms of a sequential mechanism (9.Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the kinetics of Ca2+dissociation, the two Ca2+-binding sites were suggested to be arranged in a channel-like structure (10.Petithory J.R. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5553-5564Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11.Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16338-16342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in accordance with more recent suggestions (7.MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 12.Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. M⊘ller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol.

After phosphorylation of Ca2+-ATPase from ATP, the two calcium ions are considered to be occluded inside the protein, not being able to dissociate to either side of the membrane without a change in the conformation of the protein (13.Dupont Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14.Takisawa H. Makinose M. Nature. 1981; 290: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15.McIntosh D.B.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β,γ-bidentate chromium (III) ATP complex (Cr·ATP) has been used as a Mg-ATP analogue to stabilize the occluded state of the Ca2+-ATPase, based on the observation that after complexation of Ca2+-ATPase with Cr·ATP, bound calcium only dissociates very slowly from the protein, on a time scale of hours (17.Serpersu E.H. Kirch U. Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Combined with genetic modifications of the polypeptide chain this approach has allowed identification of membranous amino acid residues critical for binding and occlusion of Ca2+. Residues indispensable for intramembranous binding of Ca2+ were initially found to be clustered in four transmembrane domains, M4 (Glu309), M5 (Glu771), M6 (Asn796, Thr799, and Asp800), and M8 (Glu908) (8.Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rept. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20.Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments involving incubation of mutated Ca2+-ATPase with Cr·ATP showed that, while side chain conservation of five of these critical residues, localized to M4, M5, and M6, was also required to maintain calcium occlusion in the presence of Cr·ATP (16.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), this was not the case for Glu908 whose side chain was therefore considered to play a less significant role than the other residues in the intramembranous binding of Ca2+ (8.Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rept. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Direct calcium binding measurements of genetically modified Ca2+-ATPase were subsequently successfully carried out by Inesi and collaborators (22.Strock C. Cavagna M. Peiffer W.E. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15104-15109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23.Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8758-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Their data demonstrated the absence of both high affinity calcium-binding sites for the inactive E771Q, T799A, and D800N as well as for the partially active E908A mutants, but the retention of one of the two high affinity calcium-binding sites for N796A and E309Q, as first reported by Skerjanc et al.(24.Skerjanc I.S. Toyofuku T. Richardson C. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15944-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies we have obtained evidence for the involvement of extramembranous amino acid residues in the L6–7 loop in the mechanism of calcium binding. This was initially suggested by the observation that, after limited proteolysis of the SR Ca2+-ATPase, changes in Ca2+-dependent rates of electrophoretic migration were observed for some of the C-terminal proteolytic peptides formed. The data could be rationalized on the basis that it is the first part of the L6–7 loop (which comprises the amino acid sequence 808–830) that interacts with Ca2+(25.Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Gomez de Gracia A. Soulié S. Centeno C. M⊘ller J. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17258-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This part of the loop contains three conserved aspartic residues (Asp813, Asp815, and Asp818) whose cluster mutation generated the D813A/D818A and D813A/D815A/D818A mutants that we found to display a marked reduction in the apparent affinity with which Ca2+ controls ATPase phosphorylation and turn-over (12.Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. M⊘ller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20134-20143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We rationalized our findings in terms of a model in which the conserved aspartic residues of the L6–7 loop mediate the interaction with calcium ions during the initial steps of Ca2+ binding process in a manner that might be related to the involvement of the loop in the gating of calcium ions on the cytosolic side, as previously suggested (1.M⊘ller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 12.Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. M⊘ller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J.

Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17258-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, in light of the crystallographic structure (4.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar) it remains unclear whether the acidic residues of the L6–7 loop are in a conformation suitable for coordination of Ca2+ binding (4.Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). As an alternative it has been proposed that the decrease in Ca2+ binding caused by mutation of the acidic residues is indirect and that the essential function of the L6–7 loop is to mediate long-range contact between intramembranous Ca2+-binding sites and the catalytic site necessary for phosphorylation by ATP (23.Zhang Z. Lewis D. Strock C. Inesi G. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8758-8767Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26.Zhang Z. Lewis D. Sumbilla C. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15232-15239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is of interest that the L6–7 loop has been the focus of another recent mutagenesis study in which it was suggested that domain IB of phospholamban makes contact with Asp813 of the loop (27.Asahi M. Green N.M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10061-10066Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To address these questions concerning the function of the L6–7 loop we found it necessary to obtain more direct information on the role of the acidic residues of the loop for Ca2+ binding and occlusion. To study Ca2+ occlusion we proceeded in a similar way as described by Vilsen and Andersen (16.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to isolate Cr·ATP-reacted and C12E8-solubilized wild type and mutated ATPase by HPLC chromatography. In addition, we have studied in detail by NMR and mass spectrometry the conformation of the synthetic L6–7 loop peptide and its interaction with Ca2+ and related lanthanides. Overall, our data support a role of the conserved aspartic residues in the initial interaction of calcium ions with Ca2+-ATPase, before their subsequent occlusion inside the membrane. Furthermore, our data throw some new light on the nature of the occlusion process. The single mutants E309Q and E771Q and the cluster mutants D813A/D818A and D813A/D815A/D818A (referred to as ADA and AAA mutants, respectively) were obtained as previously described in Refs. 12.Menguy T.

The yeast strain used in this study was Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303.1B/Gal4 (α, leu2, his3, trp1::TRP1-GAL10-GAL4, ura3, ade2–1, canr, cyr+) that had been genetically modified to overexpress Gal4p upon galactose addition (30.Lenoir, G., Menguy, Th., Corre, F., Cédric Montigny, C., Pedersen, P.

The conditions used for large scale expression and preparation of membrane fractions are described elsewhere (30.Lenoir, G., Menguy, Th., Corre, F., Cédric Montigny, C., Pedersen, P.

In our Cr·ATP-induced calcium occlusion experiments (see below) we used the yeast light membrane fraction, which contains about 1% of fully active Ca2+-ATPase (Ref. 30.Lenoir, G., Menguy, Th., Corre, F., Cédric Montigny, C., Pedersen, P.

However, we were confronted with the problem that this fraction has a high Ca2+ content. By use of calcium indicators (Quin 2 and Fluo 3) and flame photometry we estimated a Ca2+ content of 350 nmol/mg of protein (corresponding to a concentration of 3.5 mm for samples containing 10 mg/ml of total proteins). Ca2+ transport by the expressed Ca2+-ATPase can only be held partially responsible for this phenomenon, since we also found a high Ca2+ content in control yeast cell membranes, containing the empty plasmid (approximately 200 nmol/mg). The presence of substantial amounts of endogenous Ca2+ associated with the membrane preparations necessitated a preliminary Bio-Rex treatment (see “Methods” below and Fig. 1) by which we were able to remove virtually all endogenous calcium before the start of the Cr·ATP-induced Ca2+ occlusion experiments. Protein concentrations were measured by a modification of the bicinchoninic assay (32.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18643) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.5% SDS, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The amount of Ca2+-ATPase was quantified after immunodetection on Western blot as described (12.Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Deschamps S. M⊘ller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. Falson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20134-20143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For this 20-μl samples were added to 22 μl of urea-SDS denaturing buffer (33.Soulié S. M⊘ller J.V. Falson P. le Maire M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), heated for 1 min at 100 °C, and aliquots of the denatured proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (34.Juul B. Turc M. Durand M.L. de Gracia A.G. Denoroy L. Moller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol.

Lompré) or sequence-specific Ab (34.Juul B. Turc M. Durand M.L. de Gracia A.G. Denoroy L. Moller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol.

Quantitative analysis of the amount of Ca2+-ATPase present on the blots was performed with a Bio-Rad densitometer using as standard SR vesicles which were assumed to have a Ca2+-ATPase content corresponding to 75% of the total protein content. Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as previously described (35.Champeil P. Rigaud J.L. Gary-Bobo C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2405-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Proteinase K digestion of SR to prepare peptide p20C and p19C was performed in 100 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and 0.3 mmCa2+, as described in Ref. 25.Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L.

To follow the change of electrophoretic mobility of p20C relative to that of p19C, SDS-PAGE gels were prepared with inclusion of variable amount of Ca2+ or 0.02 mm EGTA in the stacking and separation gels (25.Falson P. Menguy T. Corre F. Bouneau L. Gomez de Gracia A. Soulié S. Centeno C. M⊘ller J. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol.

Occlusion experiments were performed by incubation of membrane samples with Cr·ATP and45Ca2+, followed by C12E8 solubilization and HPLC analysis. The different steps in the procedure are presented in outline form in Fig. 1. To remove contaminating metal cations (mainly calcium), light membrane fractions (600 μl at a concentration of 10 mg/ml protein in a 100 mm MOPS buffer, pH 6.5) were first treated with 200 μl of Bio-Rex beads (Bio-Rex 70 resin with a wet bead size of 150–300 μm from Bio-Rad) for 20 min at room temperature on a rotating wheel. After pelleting of the beads by a brief centrifugation, 500 μl of the supernatant was collected. To this sample (which contained a total of about 5 mg of proteins), Ca2+ was added at a final concentration of 120 μm constituted by 100 μm40Ca2+ and 20 μm45Ca2+ tracer from a stock solution together with Cr·ATP (at a final concentration of 0.8 mm). The samples were then incubated for 16 h at 20 °C. Following this incubation, the membranes were solubilized by addition of C12E8 (at a detergent/protein (w/w) ratio of 1.5:1) in the presence of 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 15 min at 4 °C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 110,000 × gfor 30 min in a TL100.3 rotor. Most of the calcium was removed from the samples by 40 min incubation with Bio-Rex beads as described above. Occluded calcium was detected as previously described in Ref. 16.Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, by submitting 200 μl of solubilized proteins to molecular sieve HPLC on a Beckman TSK G3000 SW (0.75 × 30 cm) column, equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tes, pH 7, 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 mm Ca2+, and 1 mg/ml C12E8. The flow rate was 1 ml/min and, in general, fractions of 500 μl were collected between 3 and 13 min after sample application and analyzed for45Ca2+ content by scintillation counting and for Ca2+-ATPase content by Western blot. In a few experiments, 250-μl fractions were collected to define more precisely the pattern of 45Ca2+ and ATPase elution. For determination of the Ca2+-ATPase contents, 10 μl of each collected fraction was loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel to estimate the amount of Ca2+-ATPase by Western blotting. For analysis of the 45Ca2+ contents, the radioactivity in each collected fractions was counted in 4 ml of scintillation liquid (Packard, Pico-fluor 40). Ten μl of the initial occlusion medium containing 120 μm calcium was used as a standard, to convert measured counts/min values to nanomoles of45Ca2+. Finally, the ratio of nanomoles of occluded calcium per mg of Ca2+-ATPase was calculated. This calculation included a correction for background calcium radioactivity in the fractions arising from other phenomena than specific calcium occlusion by Ca2+-ATPase. Estimation of the extent of nonspecific binding of Ca2+ was approached in a number of different ways. In one type of experiments, backgrounds were measured by incubation of control membranes without expressed Ca2+-ATPase (i.e. light membrane fractions obtained from yeasts cells plasmid pYeDP 60) under the same conditions in the presence of Ca2+ with added radioactive calcium and presence or absence of Cr·ATP. In another type of control experiments, backgrounds were estimated by first performing an overnight incubation of membrane samples in the presence of 0.12 mm nonradioactive 40Ca2+, while addition of radioactive calcium (20 μm45Ca2+) was delayed until after the membranes had been solubilized by C12E8. We also compared Cr·ATP-induced calcium occlusion for the expressed wild type and mutated Ca2+-ATPases with the occlusion of calcium by SR vesicles alone or by SR in the presence of yeast control membranes. In these controls, we took care to add rabbit SR Ca2+-ATPase to give an ATPase content similar to that present in light membranes containing expressed Ca2+-ATPases (∼1% of total protein). The SERCA L6–7 loop peptides used in this study were synthesized by Syntem (Montpellier), HPLC purified, and their purity and composition checked by mass spectrometry and two-dimensional NMR analysis. The peptides comprised not only SERCA 1 residues 808–827 (G808FNPPDLDIMDRPPRSPKEP827), but also an 808–827 variant, with alanine substituted for each of the 3 aspartates (Asp813, Asp815, and Asp818) and for Glu826 and a shorter sequence of the L6–7 loop, comprising residues 811–827. The hexapeptide, RETDYY, blocked at both termini, was used as a control when monitoring the spectral effects resulting from carboxylate side chain ionization and the binding of metal ions. The purity and composition of this hexapeptide, synthesized by Alta Biosciences (Birmingham), was also confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR analysis. Other peptides used corresponded to SERCA 1a residues 808–847 and 818–847, which represent a long and short version, designated as M7-L and M7-S, respectively, of the L6–7 loop together with the N-terminal anchor of membrane span M7. These were the same peptides as previously used in a peptide study on micelle insertion as a model of membrane interaction (37.Soulié S. de Foresta B. M⊘ller J.V. Bloomberg G.B. Groves J.D. le Maire M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding of these and the L6–7 peptides was measured with the aid of an Aminco double-beam spectrophotometer, using murexide as an indicator of the concentration of free Ca2+. The formation of the Ca2+-murexide complex was recorded from the increase in absorption of 0.2 mm murexide at 544 nm, relative to that at 495 nm. To measure Ca2+ binding by M7-L and M7-S, the peptides (1 mg/ml) were first solubilized in SDS (10 mg/ml; these peptides are known to be monomeric in SDS (37.Soulié S. de Foresta B. M⊘ller J.V. Bloomberg G.B. Groves J.D. le Maire M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, peptide binding data were corrected from the decrease in free concentration of Ca2+ resulting from the interaction with the SDS micelles as measured in the absence of peptide. These measurements were supplemented by estimations of Ca2+ binding to a larger and C-terminal proteolytic fragment (p20C, obtained by treatment with proteinase K, and representing the 808–994 sequence in SERCA 1a Ca2+-ATPase). In this case measurements of the interaction of the polypeptide fragment with Ca2+ was based on changes in electrophoretic migration rate of this proteolytic fragment by Laemmli SDS-PAGE, induced by addition of Ca2+ to the gel (25.Falson P.

The 10-residue shorter C-terminal proteolytic fragment (p19C, also obtained by treatment with proteinase K, and representing the 818–994 sequence in SERCA 1a) is not affected by addition of Ca2+ to the gel (25.Falson P.

Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry measurements were made using a 9.4T Bruker Daltonics Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance instrument as previously described (38.Lavanant H. Derrick P.J. Heck A.J. Mellon F.A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 74-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The external ESI source was equipped with a Pyrex capillary coated with platinum paint at both ends and using typical nozzle and skimmer voltages of 60 and 3 V, respectively. The background pressure in the ICR analyzer cell was maintained at less than 2 × 10−10 bar. The spectra were also used to confirm the purity and composition of the different peptide preparations. Microliter aliquots of lanthanum or calcium chloride stock solutions (100 mm) were added to 20 to 50 μm solutions of the L6–7 loop peptide (residues 808–827) in 5 mmammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.9, to achieve the required cation concentrations. The hexapeptide, RETDYY, blocked at both termini was used as a control when monitoring the extent of complex formation under these conditions. Negligible proportions of bound cation were detected using this dicarboxylate-containing peptide. All peptides were freeze-dried prior to dissolution in the appropriate buffer.

https://openalex.org/W1520305419,"The large ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica play an important role in global climate. Much attention has focused on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. In his Perspective, [Alley][1] highlights the report by [ Joughin et al .][2], who show that in the region of the West Antarctic drainage into the Ross Sea, on average, the ice sheet is thickening slowly. Earlier studies indicated a net thinning in this region. The results may indicate the stabilization or readvance of the ice sheet, but the system is complex and existing data are insufficient to identify a trend.
