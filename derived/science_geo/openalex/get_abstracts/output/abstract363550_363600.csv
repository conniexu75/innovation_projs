https://openalex.org/W2012254064,"Unidirectional electric current flow, such as that found in a diode, is essential for modern electronics. It usually occurs at asymmetric interfaces such as p-n junctions or metal/semiconductor interfaces with Schottky barriers. We report on a diode effect associated with the direction of bulk electric polarization in BiFeO3: a ferroelectric with a small optical gap edge of approximately 2.2 electron volts. We found that bulk electric conduction in ferroelectric monodomain BiFeO3 crystals is highly nonlinear and unidirectional. This diode effect switches its direction when the electric polarization is flipped by an external voltage. A substantial visible-light photovoltaic effect is observed in BiFeO3 diode structures. These results should improve understanding of charge conduction mechanisms in leaky ferroelectrics and advance the design of switchable devices combining ferroelectric, electronic, and optical functionalities."
https://openalex.org/W1985270286,"Agricultural crops benefit from resistance to pathogens that endures over years and generations of both pest and crop. Durable disease resistance, which may be partial or complete, can be controlled by several genes. Some of the most devastating fungal pathogens in wheat are leaf rust, stripe rust, and powdery mildew. The wheat gene Lr34 has supported resistance to these pathogens for more than 50 years. Lr34 is now shared by wheat cultivars around the world. Here, we show that the LR34 protein resembles adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette transporters of the pleiotropic drug resistance subfamily. Alleles of Lr34 conferring resistance or susceptibility differ by three genetic polymorphisms. The Lr34 gene, which functions in the adult plant, stimulates senescence-like processes in the flag leaf tips and edges."
https://openalex.org/W1972243282,"Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is an important disinfectant and bleach and is currently manufactured from an indirect process involving sequential hydrogenation/oxidation of anthaquinones. However, a direct process in which H 2 and O 2 are reacted would be preferable. Unfortunately, catalysts for the direct synthesis of H 2 O 2 are also effective for its subsequent decomposition, and this has limited their development. We show that acid pretreatment of a carbon support for gold-palladium alloy catalysts switches off the decomposition of H 2 O 2 . This treatment decreases the size of the alloy nanoparticles, and these smaller nanoparticles presumably decorate and inhibit the sites for the decomposition reaction. Hence, when used in the direct synthesis of H 2 O 2 , the acid-pretreated catalysts give high yields of H 2 O 2 with hydrogen selectivities greater than 95%."
https://openalex.org/W2065552006,"Generating laterally ordered, ultradense, macroscopic arrays of nanoscopic elements will revolutionize the microelectronic and storage industries. We used faceted surfaces of commercially available sapphire wafers to guide the self-assembly of block copolymer microdomains into oriented arrays with quasi–long-range crystalline order over arbitrarily large wafer surfaces. Ordered arrays of cylindrical microdomains 3 nanometers in diameter, with areal densities in excess of 10 terabits per square inch, were produced. The sawtoothed substrate topography provides directional guidance to the self-assembly of the block copolymer, which is tolerant of surface defects, such as dislocations. The lateral ordering and lattice orientation of the single-grain arrays of microdomains are maintained over the entire surface. The approach described is parallel, applicable to different substrates and block copolymers, and opens a versatile route toward ultrahigh-density systems."
https://openalex.org/W2084795601,"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is essential for protecting cells from protein-damaging stress associated with misfolded proteins and regulates the insulin-signaling pathway and aging. Here, we show that human HSF1 is inducibly acetylated at a critical residue that negatively regulates DNA binding activity. Activation of the deacetylase and longevity factor SIRT1 prolonged HSF1 binding to the heat shock promoter Hsp70 by maintaining HSF1 in a deacetylated, DNA–binding competent state. Conversely, down-regulation of SIRT1 accelerated the attenuation of the heat shock response (HSR) and release of HSF1 from its cognate promoter elements. These results provide a mechanistic basis for the requirement of HSF1 in the regulation of life span and establish a role for SIRT1 in protein homeostasis and the HSR."
https://openalex.org/W2055403237,"Stripe rust is a devastating fungal disease that afflicts wheat in many regions of the world. New races of Puccinia striiformis , the pathogen responsible for this disease, have overcome most of the known race-specific resistance genes. We report the map-based cloning of the gene Yr36 ( WKS1 ), which confers resistance to a broad spectrum of stripe rust races at relatively high temperatures (25° to 35°C). This gene includes a kinase and a putative START lipid-binding domain. Five independent mutations and transgenic complementation confirmed that both domains are necessary to confer resistance. Yr36 is present in wild wheat but is absent in modern pasta and bread wheat varieties, and therefore it can now be used to improve resistance to stripe rust in a broad set of varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2059658112,"Aging induces gradual yet massive cell death in higher organisms, including annual plants. Even so, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are barely known, despite the long-standing interest in this topic. Here, we demonstrate that ORE1, which is a NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor, positively regulates aging-induced cell death in Arabidopsis leaves. ORE1 expression is up-regulated concurrently with leaf aging by EIN2 but is negatively regulated by miR164. miR164 expression gradually decreases with aging through negative regulation by EIN2 , which leads to the elaborate up-regulation of ORE1 expression. However, EIN2 still contributes to aging-induced cell death in the absence of ORE1 . The trifurcate feed-forward pathway involving ORE1, miR164 , and EIN2 provides a highly robust regulation to ensure that aging induces cell death in Arabidopsis leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2077070573,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are highly energetic explosions signaling the death of massive stars in distant galaxies. The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi Observatory together record GRBs over a broad energy range spanning about 7 decades of gammaray energy. In September 2008, Fermi observed the exceptionally luminous GRB 080916C, with the largest apparent energy release yet measured. The high-energy gamma rays are observed to start later and persist longer than the lower energy photons. A simple spectral form fits the entire GRB spectrum, providing strong constraints on emission models. The known distance of the burst enables placing lower limits on the bulk Lorentz factor of the outflow and on the quantum gravity mass."
https://openalex.org/W2059022270,Electronic confinement at nanoscale dimensions remains a central means of science and technology. We demonstrate nanoscale lateral confinement of a quasi–two-dimensional electron gas at a lanthanum aluminate–strontium titanate interface. Control of this confinement using an atomic force microscope lithography technique enabled us to create tunnel junctions and field-effect transistors with characteristic dimensions as small as 2 nanometers. These electronic devices can be modified or erased without the need for complex lithographic procedures. Our on-demand nanoelectronics fabrication platform has the potential for widespread technological application.
https://openalex.org/W2023947747,"Thin layers of phytoplankton are important hotspots of ecological activity that are found in the coastal ocean, meters beneath the surface, and contain cell concentrations up to two orders of magnitude above ambient concentrations. Current interpretations of their formation favor abiotic processes, yet many phytoplankton species found in these layers are motile. We demonstrated that layers formed when the vertical migration of phytoplankton was disrupted by hydrodynamic shear. This mechanism, which we call gyrotactic trapping, can be responsible for the thin layers of phytoplankton commonly observed in the ocean. These results reveal that the coupling between active microorganism motility and ambient fluid motion can shape the macroscopic features of the marine ecological landscape."
https://openalex.org/W2000496027,"The nitrogen cycle provides essential nutrients to the biosphere, but its antiquity in modern form is unclear. In a drill core though homogeneous organic-rich shale in the 2.5-billion-year-old Mount McRae Shale, Australia, nitrogen isotope values vary from +1.0 to +7.5 per mil (‰) and back to +2.5‰ over ∼30 meters. These changes evidently record a transient departure from a largely anaerobic to an aerobic nitrogen cycle complete with nitrification and denitrification. Complementary molybdenum abundance and sulfur isotopic values suggest that nitrification occurred in response to a small increase in surface-ocean oxygenation. These data imply that nitrifying and denitrifying microbes had already evolved by the late Archean and were present before oxygen first began to accumulate in the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2093146198,"The spontaneous component of neuropathic pain (NP) has not been explored sufficiently with neuroimaging techniques, given the difficulty to coax out the brain components that sustain background ongoing pain. Here, we address for the first time the correlates of this component in an fMRI study of a group of eight patients suffering from diabetic neuropathic pain and eight healthy control subjects. Specifically, we studied the functional connectivity that is associated with spontaneous neuropathic pain with spatial independent component analysis (sICA).Functional connectivity analyses revealed a cortical network consisting of two anti-correlated patterns: one includes the left fusiform gyrus, the left lingual gyrus, the left inferior temporal gyrus, the right inferior occipital gyrus, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex bilaterally, the pre and postcentral gyrus bilaterally, in which its activity is correlated negatively with pain and positively with the controls; the other includes the left precuneus, dorsolateral prefrontal, frontopolar cortex (both bilaterally), right superior frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, thalami, both insulae, inferior parietal lobuli, right mammillary body, and a small area in the left brainstem, in which its activity is correlated positively with pain and negatively with the controls. Furthermore, a power spectra analyses revealed group differences in the frequency bands wherein the sICA signal was decomposed: patients' spectra are shifted towards higher frequencies.In conclusion, we have characterized here for the first time a functional network of brain areas that mark the spontaneous component of NP. Pain is the result of aberrant default mode functional connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2088909840,"Previous investigations into the impact of open-access journals on subsequent citations confounded open and electronic access and failed to track availability over time. With new data, we separated these effects. We demonstrate that a journal receives a modest increase in citations when it comes online freely, but the jump is larger when it first comes online through commercial sources. This effect reverses for poor countries where free-access articles are much more likely to be cited. Together, findings suggest that free Internet access widens the circle of those who read and make use of scientists' investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2046688088,"Embryogenesis depends on self-regulatory interactions between spatially separated signaling centers, but few of these are well understood. Limb development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal (e-m) feedback loops between sonic hedgehog (SHH) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling involving the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist Gremlin1 (GREM1). By combining mouse molecular genetics with mathematical modeling, we showed that BMP4 first initiates and SHH then propagates e-m feedback signaling through differential transcriptional regulation of Grem1 to control digit specification. This switch occurs by linking a fast BMP4/GREM1 module to the slower SHH/GREM1/FGF e-m feedback loop. This self-regulatory signaling network results in robust regulation of distal limb development that is able to compensate for variations by interconnectivity among the three signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1964823824,"Previous studies have shown that administration of fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF-19) reverses diabetes, hepatic steatosis, hyperlipidemia, and adipose accretion in animal models of obesity. To investigate the mechanism for this effect, we determined whether FGF-19 modulated hepatic fatty acid synthesis, a key process controlling glucose tolerance and triacylglycerol accumulation in liver, blood, and adipose tissue. Incubating primary hepatocyte cultures with recombinant FGF-19 suppressed the ability of insulin to stimulate fatty acid synthesis. This effect was associated with a reduction in the expression of lipogenic enzymes. FGF-19 also suppressed the insulin-induced expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), a key transcriptional activator of lipogenic genes. FGF-19 inhibition of lipogenic enzyme expression was not mediated by alterations in the activity of the insulin signal transduction pathway or changes in the activity of ERK, p38 MAPK, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In contrast, FGF-19 increased the activity of STAT3, an inhibitor of SREBP-1c expression and decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1beta (PGC-1beta), an activator of SREBP-1c activity. FGF-19 also increased the expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP), a transcriptional repressor that inhibits lipogenic enzyme expression via a SREBP-1c-independent mechanism. Inhibition of SREBP-1c activity by changes in STAT3 and PGC-1beta activity and inhibition of gene transcription by an elevation in SHP expression can explain the inhibition of lipogenesis caused by FGF-19. In summary, the inhibitory effect of FGF-19 on insulin activation of hepatic fatty acid synthesis constitutes a mechanism that would explain the beneficial effect of FGF-19 on metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1492160811,"The water vapor feedback is the process whereby an initial warming of the planet, caused, for example, by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, leads to an increase in the humidity of the atmosphere. Because water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas, this increase in humidity causes additional warming. The water vapor feedback has long been expected to strongly amplify climate changes because of the expectation that the atmosphere’s relative humidity would remain roughly constant— meaning that the specific humidity would increase at the rate of the equilibrium vapor pressure, which rises rapidly with temperature. However, observational evidence has been harder to come by, and the effect has been controversial. Much of that controversy can now be laid to rest, thanks to new observations and better theoretical understanding."
https://openalex.org/W1969989079,"KshAB (3-Ketosteroid 9α-hydroxylase) is a two-component Rieske oxygenase (RO) in the cholesterol catabolic pathway of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although the enzyme has been implicated in pathogenesis, it has largely been characterized by bioinformatics and molecular genetics. Purified KshB, the reductase component, was a monomeric protein containing a plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster and FAD. KshA, the oxygenase, was a homotrimer containing a Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster and mononuclear ferrous iron. Of two potential substrates, reconstituted KshAB had twice the specificity for 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione as for 4-androstene-3,17-dione. The transformation of both substrates was well coupled to the consumption of O2. Nevertheless, the reactivity of KshAB with O2 was low in the presence of 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione, with a kcat/KmO2 of 2450 ± 80 m–1 s–1. The crystallographic structure of KshA, determined to 2.3Å, revealed an overall fold and a head-to-tail subunit arrangement typical of ROs. The central fold of the catalytic domain lacks all insertions found in characterized ROs, consistent with a minimal and perhaps archetypical RO catalytic domain. The structure of KshA is further distinguished by a C-terminal helix, which stabilizes subunit interactions in the functional trimer. Finally, the substrate-binding pocket extends farther into KshA than in other ROs, consistent with the large steroid substrate, and the funnel accessing the active site is differently orientated.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, arguably the world's most successful pathogen, infects one-third of the human population and has again become a global threat due in part to the emergence of extensively drug-resistant strains (XDR-TB) that are virtually untreatable with current medicines (1World Health Organization Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance in the World, Report No. 4. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2008: 14-21Google Scholar). Despite this alarming development, a surprising amount of the pathogen's physiology remains unknown. One recently discovered aspect of the physiology of M. tuberculosis is its cholesterol catabolic pathway (2van der Geize R. Yam K. Heuser T. Wilbrink M.H. Hara H. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Dijkhuizen L.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 4376-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) and degradation (4Yam K. D'Angelo I. Kalscheuer R. Zhu H. Wang J. Snieckus V. Ly L.H. Converse P.J. Jacobs W.R. Strynadka N. Eltis L.D. PLoS Pathog. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) in various animal models have indicated that cholesterol catabolism is most important during the chronic phase of infection, although the latter study also provided evidence that it occurs from an early stage and contributes to dissemination of the pathogen in the host. Further study of cholesterol catabolism and the pathway enzymes are required to elucidate the precise role of cholesterol catabolism in infection.The cholesterol catabolic pathway of M. tuberculosis involves degradation of the branched alkyl side chain and the four-ringed steroid nucleus, as occurs in Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, a nonpathogenic, mycolic acid-producing actinomycete (2van der Geize R. Yam K. Heuser T. Wilbrink M.H. Hara H. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Dijkhuizen L. Davies J.E. Mohn W.W. Eltis L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), although it is unclear whether the order of this degradation is obligatory. Side-chain degradation proceeds via a β-oxidative type process. Degradation of the steroid nucleus is initiated by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, resulting in the formation of 4-cholestene-3-one (5Yang X. Dubnau E. Smith I. Sampson N.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9058-9067Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The successive actions of KstD (3-ketosteroid-1Δ-dehydrogenase), which catalyzes the 1,2-desaturation of ring A, and KshAB (3-ketosteroid 9α-hydroxylase) (Fig. 1) lead to the opening of ring B with concomitant aromatization of ring A (6van der Geize R.

Ring A is subsequently hydroxylated to yield a catechol and then subject to meta-cleavage (2van der Geize R. Yam K. Heuser T. Wilbrink M.H. Hara H. Anderton M.C. Sim E. Dijkhuizen L. Davies J.E.

Interestingly, M. tuberculosis appears to catabolize ring A completely to CO2 while incorporating the side chain carbon into its lipid pool (3Pandey A.K. Sassetti C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 4376-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Finally, the metabolic fate of rings C and D is unclear in M. tuberculosis. Consistent with the role of cholesterol catabolism in pathogenesis, a transposon disruption mutant of kshA strongly attenuated the growth of the pathogen in interferon-γ-activated macrophages, conditions that mimic the immune response (10Rengarajan J.

Sequence analyses indicate that KshB contains a plant-type [2Fe2S] cluster and a flavin prosthetic group, whereas KshA contains a Rieske-type [2Fe2S] cluster, coordinated by two histidine and two cysteine residues, and a mononuclear iron center, coordinated by two histidines and one aspartate. The latter metallocenter mediates the oxygenation reaction in ROs. Gene disruption studies in Rhodococcus erythropolis SQ1 (6van der Geize R. Hessels G.I. van Gerwen R. van der Meijden P.

However, the substrate specificity of KshAB is unclear, as is the physiological sequence of the reactions catalyzed by this enzyme and KstD.ROs catalyze a range of reactions in which one or both atoms of O2 are incorporated into an organic substrate in a stereo- and regio-specific manner (12Ferraro D.J. Gakhar L. Ramaswamy S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The reaction cycle requires two reducing equivalents, which originate from NAD(P)H and which are transferred from the reductase to the oxygenase, sometimes via a ferredoxin (12Ferraro D.J. Gakhar L.

Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Structural studies have revealed that although the oxygenase component can comprise one or two different subunits, it is always trimeric: α3, α3β3, or(α3)2. In all cases, the α subunit comprises an N-terminal “Rieske” domain harboring the [2Fe-2S] cluster and a larger “catalytic” domain harboring the mononuclear iron (12Ferraro D.J. Gakhar L. Ramaswamy S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The residues coordinating these two metallocenters are conserved. Moreover, the α subunits are arranged head-to-tail within the trimer such that the [2Fe-2S] cluster and the mononuclear iron of adjacent subunits are with within ∼12 Å of each other and comprise the functional unit of the enzyme. An essential aspartate residue bridges the two metallocenters (19Parales R.E. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and appears to play a role in preventing the activation of O2 in the absence of substrate (20Martins B.M. Svetlitchnaia T. Dobbek H.

The data are discussed in terms of the physiological role of KshAB as well as the structure and function of ROs.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Reagents-ADD was purchased from Steraloids, Inc. (Newport, RI). AD was purchased from Sigma. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl was a gift from Dr. Victor Snieckus. Restriction enzymes and the Expand high fidelity PCR system were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) and Roche Applied Science (Laval, Quebec, Canada), respectively. Oligonucleotides for amplifying kshA and kshB were purchased from the Nucleic Acid Protein Service Unit at the University of British Columbia. For kshA, the sequences were 5′-GCAATAGCATATGAGTACCGACACGAGTGGGGTCG-3′ and 5′-TCTAAGCTTTTGCTCGGCGGGCACGTCGT-3′. For kshB, the sequences were 5′-CGGAAGGCATATGACCGAGGCAATT-3′ and 5′-GACAAGCTTCTACTCGTCGTAGGTCACT-3′. Jeffamine M600 was purchased from Hampton Research (La Jolla, CA). All other reagents were of HPLC or analytical grade. Water for buffers was purified using a Barnstead Nanopure Diamond™ system (Dubuque, Iowa) to a resistance of at least 18 megaohms.DNA Manipulation and Plasmid Construction-DNA was propagated, digested, ligated, and transformed using standard protocols (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA plasmids were purified as described previously (27Pulleyblank D. Michalak M. Daisley S.L. Glick R. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 9: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and were transformed into Escherichia coli by electroporation using a MicroPulser from Bio-Rad with Bio-Rad 0.1-cm GenePulser cuvettes. The kshA (Rv3526) and kshB (Rv3571) genes were amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA using polymerase chain reactions containing 0.2 μg of template DNA, 0.9 units of the Expand High Fidelity PCR System polymerase, a 50 μm concentration of each dNTP, and 75 pmol of each oligonucleotide in a volume of 25 μl. Reactions were subject to 25 temperature cycles using a Stratagene Robocycler Gradient 96 instrument (La Jolla, CA) as follows: 95 °C for 45 s, 45 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. The kshA and kshB amplicons were each digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated into pET41b to yield pETKA1 and pETKB3, respectively. The kshA gene had its stop codon removed such that KshA was produced with a C-terminal His8 tag. Nucleotide sequences were confirmed by the Nucleic Acid Protein Service Unit at the University of British Columbia.Bacterial Strains and Growth-KshA and KshB were heterologously produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pETKA1 and pETKB3. Production of the two components was improved by producing them in cells that also contained pPAISC-1, a vector containing the iron sulfur cluster genes, as described previously (28Gomez-Gil L. Kumar P. Barriault D. Bolin J.T. Sylvestre M. Eltis L.D. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5705-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Luria broth supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 7.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and an HCl-solubilized solution of minerals (29Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One liter of medium inoculated with 10 ml of an overnight culture was incubated at 25 °C and 37 °C for KshA and KshB, respectively. When the OD reached 0.5, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and cultures were incubated for a further 18 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Pellets were washed twice with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol and frozen at –80 °C until use.Protein Purification-Chromatography was performed using anÄKTA Explorer (Amersham Biosciences) unless otherwise stated. KshA was O2-labile and was therefore purified anaerobically by interfacing the system to a Labmaster model 100 glove box (M. Braun, Inc., Peabody, MA) operated at <5 ppm O2, as described previously (29Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). KshB was stable in air-saturated buffer and was therefore purified aerobically.To purify KshA, cells from 4 liters of culture were resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol and disrupted by passing the suspension four times through an Emulsiflex-05 homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) operated at 10,000 p.s.i. Ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm after the first pass. The cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation (10,000 × g for 45 min). The clear supernatant fluid (∼30 ml) was decanted and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. This raw extract was loaded onto a gravity-operated Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column (1.8 × 4 cm) mounted in the glove box and equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol. The protein was eluted using an imidazole step gradient according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The brown fraction eluted using 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and was exchanged into 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 5% glycerol (buffer A) and concentrated to ∼7 ml using a stirred cell concentrator equipped with a YM30 membrane (Amicon, Oakville, Ontario). The solution was brought to 50 mm NaCl. Human α-thrombin (HTI, Essex Junction, VT) was then added to a molar ratio of 1:410 thrombin/KshA, and the solution was incubated at room temperature overnight. The sample was loaded onto a 1 × 10-cm column of Source™15Q (GE Healthcare) resin equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.25 mm FAS. The enzyme was eluted with a step gradient of NaCl, with KshA eluting at 0.15 m NaCl. Brown-colored fractions were combined, exchanged into buffer A with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.25 mm FAS, concentrated to 20–25 mg/ml, and flash frozen as beads in liquid N2.To purify KshB, cells from 2 liters of culture were resuspended in buffer A, lysed, and filtered as described above, without adding ferrous ammonium sulfate to the lysate. The raw extract was loaded onto a 1 × 10-cm column Source™15Q resin equilibrated with buffer A. KshB was eluted with a linear gradient of 220–360 mm NaCl in 112 ml of buffer A. Orange-colored fractions were combined, exchanged into buffer A, concentrated to 20–25 mg/ml, and flash frozen in liquid N2. Purified KshA and KshB were stored at –80 °C. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl dehydrogenase was prepared as previously described (29Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Analytical Methods-SDS-PAGE was performed using a Bio-Rad MiniPROTEAN III apparatus with a 12% resolving gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue according to standard protocols. Protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. KshA concentrations were routinely determined using ∈280 = 142 mm–1 cm–1 and ∈324 = 23.2 mm–1 cm–1. Acid-labile sulfur content of samples was determined colorimetrically using the N,N-dimethyl-paraphenylene diamine assay (30Chen J.S. Mortenson L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Iron content was determined using the Ferene S assay (31Zabinski R. Munck E. Champion P.M. Wood J.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3212-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) adapted for the 96-well plate format. Briefly, 80-μl standards containing 5–75 μm FeCl2 and protein samples containing 1–2 nmol of iron were incubated for 10 min with 10 μl of 12 n HCl. Ten μl of 80% trichloroacetic acid was then added, and protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were added to 20 μl of 45% sodium acetate in a 96-well plate, to which was then added 100 μl of Ferene S reagent (0.75 mm Ferene S, 10 mm l-ascorbic acid, 45% sodium acetate). Absorbances were read at 562 nm using a VMax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Prior to these analyses, KshA samples were exchanged into 0.1 m potassium phosphate at pH 7.0 by gel filtration chromatography to remove interfering substances. Gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry was performed using an HP 6890 series GC system fitted with an HP-5MS 30 m × 250 μm column (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) and an HP 5973 mass-selective detector.Kinetic Analysis-Enzyme activities were measured by following oxygen consumption using a Clarke-type electrode interfaced to a computer (model 5301; Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH). The electrode was standardized using 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dehydrogenase, and initial velocities were calculated from progress curves essentially as described previously (29Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The standard activity assay was performed in a total volume of 1.34 ml of air-saturated 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 430 μm NADH, 380 μm ADD, 0.8 μm KshB, and 0.4 μm KshA. The reaction was initiated by adding KshA after equilibration of all other components for 30 s. Reaction velocities were corrected for oxygen consumption observed prior to KshA addition. Stock solutions were prepared fresh daily. KshA was thawed, exchanged into 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, anaerobically using gel filtration chromatography, and stored in a sealed vial on ice. Aliquots were withdrawn as required using gas-tight syringes. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to consume 1 μmol of substrate/min under the standard assay conditions.Apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for AD and ADD were determined by measuring rates of O2 consumption in the presence of various concentrations of substrate. Determinations of apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for O2 were measured in the presence of 380 μm ADD. In these experiments, the reaction buffer was equilibrated for 20 min by vigorous bubbling with mixtures of N2 and O2 prior to the reaction, and the reaction cuvette was continually flushed with the same gas mixture during the reaction. Kinetic parameters were evaluated by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data using the least-squares fitting and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA (32Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar).HPLC Analysis-Samples were analyzed using a Waters 2695 Separations HPLC module equipped with a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector and a 250 × 4.60-mm C18 Prodigy 10u ODS-Prep column (Phenominex, Torrance, CA). Flavins were identified using the method of Faeder and Siegel (33Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of 400 μm KshB was diluted to 500 μl using 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.7, containing 0.1 mm EDTA in a light-shielded tube. The mixture was heated at 100 °C for 3 min, rapidly cooled on ice, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a 0.2-μm filter, and 100 μl was injected onto the HPLC column equilibrated with aqueous 0.5% phosphoric acid and operated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Flavins were eluted using a gradient of 0–100% methanol in 60 ml. Solutions of FMN and FAD were used as standards.Determination of enzyme coupling using ADD as a substrate was conducted in air-saturated 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 1 mm phenylalanine in the presence of 1.3 μm KshA and concentrations of all other components corresponding to those of the standard assay. Coupling experiments using AD as a substrate were performed as above with buffer equilibrated with 80% oxygen. 1 mm phenylalanine was not found to change the rate of reaction with either substrate (results not shown). After 5 min, reactions were quenched by diluting 200 μl of the reaction mixture in 200 μl of methanol. One hundred μl of this mixture was injected onto the column equilibrated with 30% methanol in 0.5% aqueous phosphoric acid. The column was operated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the sample was eluted with a step gradient of methanol, with phenylalanine eluting with 30% methanol and ADD and AD eluting at 80% methanol. A standard curve of the peak area ratios of substrate and phenylalanine was used to quantify the substrate. Oxygen consumption was monitored using the oxygen electrode.Crystallization-Crystals of KshA were grown aerobically at room temperature (18 °C) using the sitting drop method. Drops contained a 1:1 ratio of 290–400 μm KshA in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.25 mm FAS and crystallization solution containing 1.1 m sodium malonate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, and 0.5% (v/v) Jeffamine M600. Single dark brown crystals appeared in 3–5 weeks and grew to their full size (200 × 300 × 50 μm) in ∼3 months. Prior to data collection, KshA crystals were serially transferred between solutions of mother liquor supplemented with increasing amounts of ethylene glycol (5–20%) and flash frozen in liquid N2.X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination-X-ray data collections were performed under cryogenic conditions using an in-house rotating anode x-ray generator (CuKa radiation λ = 1.542 Å) and at the Canadian Light Source (Beamline CMCF1, λ = 1.000 Å). Data were processed using XDS (34Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3214) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Substructure solution and initial phasing were performed using the PHENIX program suite (35Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar). The wavelength used (λ = 1.542 Å) and the redundant nature of the data allowed for the location of three iron and six sulfur sites using the HYSS (hybrid substructure search) heavy atom search routine, accounting for one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Initial single wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing was performed using PHASER (36McCoy A.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar) (as implemented in PHENIX), enabling the calculation of a readily interpretable electron density map. The initial electron density map was then subjected to various cycles of density modification coupled to gradual phase extension and initial backbone tracing using the program Resolve (37Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). The resulting partial model was iteratively rebuilt using COOT (38Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22822) Google Scholar), and the structure was refined using REFMAC (39Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A."
https://openalex.org/W1982171433,"The Pyrrhocoris apterus (Insecta: Heteroptera) adults attain high levels of cold tolerance during their overwintering diapause. Non-diapause reproducing adults, however, lack the capacity to express a whole array of cold-tolerance adaptations and show relatively low survival when exposed to sub-zero temperatures. We assessed the competence of non-diapause males of P. apterus for responding to heat- and cold-stresses by up-regulation of 70 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsps) and the role of Hsps during repair of heat- and cold-induced injury.The fragments of P. apterus homologues of Hsp70 inducible (PaHsp70) and cognate forms (PaHsc70) were cloned and sequenced. The abundance of mRNA transcripts for the inducible form (qPCR) and corresponding protein (Western blotting) were significantly up-regulated in response to high and low temperature stimuli. In the cognate form, mRNA was slightly up-regulated in response to both stressors but very low or no up-regulation of protein was apparent after heat- or cold-stress, respectively. Injection of 695 bp-long Pahsp70 dsRNA (RNAi) caused drastic suppression of the heat- and cold-stress-induced Pahsp70 mRNA response and the up-regulation of corresponding protein was practically eliminated. Our RNAi predictably prevented recovery from heat shock and, in addition, negatively influenced repair of chilling injuries caused by cold stress. Cold tolerance increased when the insects were first exposed to a mild heat shock, in order to trigger the up-regulation of PaHsp70, and subsequently exposed to cold stress.Our results suggest that accumulation of PaHsp70 belongs to a complex cold tolerance adaptation in the insect Pyrrhocoris apterus."

Understanding the role of matrices may shed some light on the mechanism of biomineralization. Here, a 1401-bp full-length cDNA sequence encoding a novel matrix protein was cloned from the mantle of the bivalve oyster, Pinctada fucata. The deduced protein (Prisilkin-39), which has a molecular mass of 39.3 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.83, was fully characterized, and its role in biomineralization was demonstrated using both in vivo and in vitro crystal growth assays. Prisilkin-39 is a highly repetitive protein with an unusual composition of Gly, Tyr, and Ser residues. Expression of Prisilkin-39 was localized to columnar epithelial cells of the mantle edge, corresponding to the calcitic prismatic layer formation. Immunostaining in situ and immunodetection in vitro revealed the presence of a characteristic pattern of Prisilkin-39 in the organic sheet and in sheaths around the prisms. Prisilkin-39 binds tightly with chitin, an insoluble polysaccharide that forms the highly structured framework of the shell. Antibody injection in vivo resulted in dramatic morphological deformities in the inner shell surface structure, where large amounts of CaCO3 were deposited in an uncontrolled manner. Moreover, Prisilkin-39 strictly prohibited the precipitation of aragonite in vitro. Taken together, Prisilkin-39 is the first protein shown to have dual function, involved both in the chitinous framework building and in crystal growth regulation during the prismatic layer mineralization. These observations may extend our view on the rare group of basic matrices and their functions during elaboration of the molluscan shell.

These observations may extend our view on the rare group of basic matrices and their functions during elaboration of the molluscan shell. The molluscan shell represents one of the most well known organo-mineral composites in the field of biologically controlled mineralization. It is a characteristically layered structure composed of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite, aragonite, or both, with small amounts of organic material (1Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization.Oxford University Press, New York. 1989; Google Scholar). Although the integral organic macromolecules typically constitute less than 5 weight % of the biomineralized shell, they are, however, the major component responsible for different aspects of the shell formation process, including nucleation, polymorphism, orientation, morphology, and organization of growing crystallites, and they contribute in this way to the unique nano-scale structure and extraordinary properties of the shell (2Belcher A.M. Wu X.H. Christensen R.J. Hansma P.K. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Nature.. 1996; 381: 56-58Google Scholar, 3Shen X. Belcher A.M. Hansma P.K. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 32472-32481Google Scholar). Meanwhile, because of their exceptional self-assembling capacity and regulatory activity in the complex shell building process, shell matrices are also regarded as a source of bioactive molecules that can provide applied perspectives in the biomaterial and biomedical fields (4Marin F. Luquet G. Marie B. Medakovic D. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol... 2008; 80: 209-276Google Scholar). Since the pioneering work of Sudo et al. (5Sudo S. Fujikawa T. Nagakura T. Ohkubo T. Sakaguchi K. Tanaka M. Nakashima K. Takahashi T. Nature.. 1997; 387: 563-564Google Scholar), Miyamoto et al. (6Miyamoto H. Miyashita T. Okushima M. Nakano S. Morita T. Matsushiro A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Metab... 2004; 22: 163-169Google Scholar). However, information on the structure and role of the organic matrix is still limited, and the detailed molecular mechanism of shell mineralization holds much to be discovered. This is presumably due to problems associated with separation and purification of these biomacromolecules (10Berman A. Addadi L. Weiner S. Nature.. 1988; 331: 546-548Google Scholar, 11Weiner S. Addadi L. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1991; 16: 252-256Google Scholar), as well as the lack of suitable in vivo or in vitro models to study them. The shell of the bivalve oyster consists of two mineralized layers as follows: an inner nacreous and an outer prismatic layer. Based on a comparative analysis of currently known molluscan shell proteins according to the different shell layers in which they are present, the interesting phenomenon of an unbalanced protein distribution pattern has been discovered. It mainly embodies the fact that all of the extremely acidic shell proteins (pI < 4.5) are preferentially associated with the calcitic prismatic layer rather than the aragonitic nacreous layer (4Marin F. Luquet G. Marie B. Medakovic D. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol... 2008; 80: 209-276Google Scholar, 5Sudo S. Fujikawa T. Nagakura T. Ohkubo T. Sakaguchi K. Tanaka M. Nakashima K. Takahashi T.

Acidic matrix proteins are believed to be the major components in the soluble fraction of the shell matrix, and they exert effective control over the crystal growth because of their cation-binding capacity (17Hare P.E. Science.. 1963; 139: 216-217Google Scholar, 18Weiner S. Hood L. Science.. 1975; 190: 987-989Google Scholar, 19Weiner S.

Previous reports have revealed that these highly acidic proteins can decide the calcium carbonate polymorphism in vitro (2Belcher A.M. Wu X.H. Christensen R.J. Hansma P.K. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Nature.. 1996; 381: 56-58Google Scholar, 12Tsukamoto D. Sarashina I. Endo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2004; 320: 1175-1180Google Scholar, 21Falini G. Albeck S. Weiner S. Addadi L.

Sarashina I. Endo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2004; 320: 1175-1180Google Scholar, 23Takeuchi T. Sarashina I. Iijima M. Endo K. FEBS Lett... 2008; 582: 591-596Google Scholar), which acts as a crystal nucleator to induce calcite precipitation using the mechanism of ionotropy, and it is therefore crucial for the formation of the prismatic layer. In contrast, basic matrix proteins exclusively associated with the prismatic layer have been far less studied. Until now, only three proteins, including the Shematrin family (24Yano M. Nagai K. Morimoto K. Miyamoto H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 2006; 144: 254-262Google Scholar), KRMPs (25Zhang C. Xie L. Huang J. Liu X. Zhang R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol... 2007; 146: 207-214Google Scholar), have been reported and characterized only at the genetic level. It has been speculated that they play key roles in the process of framework construction on the basis of information from the primary structure. However, no direct proof has been provided. In the process of molluscan shell building, two different kinds of polymorphic crystals are precipitated at specific sites of the shell layers and arranged in a highly ordered manner, finally resulting in the exquisite architecture. What is the key link for their precisely controlled precipitation? The reason for the transition of the shell layers is an intriguing question, but the answer remains unclear. One point to mention is the previous finding that an organic sheet, sandwiched between the prismatic layer and the nacreous layer, has been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (27Marin F.

Because the organic sheet interacts simultaneously with both calcified layers as the only intermedium in-between, it is considered to be, to some extent, responsible for particular steps during the polymorphic transition. However, little is known about this organic sheet as yet. It is so thin (10-50 μm) that no matrix protein within this layer has ever been successfully characterized. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a matrix protein named Prisilkin-39, which is proven to be the first protein localized in the organic sheet, as well as to be a novel basic protein associated with the prismatic layer from the oyster Pinctada fucata. The nature and function of Prisilkin-39 in the shell mineralization process were elucidated by a combination of biochemical and genetic analyses. Our results demonstrated that Prisilkin-39 likely serves a dual role, both participating in the process of organic framework construction and aragonite-specific inhibition during the calcitic prismatic layer mineralization. Animals—Rapidly growing specimens (25-35 g wet weight) of P. fucata were collected from the Guofa Pearl Farm in Beihai, Guangxi Province, China. The oysters were maintained in aerated artificial seawater (Sude Reef Sea Salt, 3% at 25 °C) for 3 days prior to experimentation. RNA Purification and Complementary DNA Synthesis—Total RNA was extracted from the mantle tissue of P. fucata using an RNA isolation kit, RNAzol (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The integrity of RNA was determined by fractionation on 1.2% formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide. The quantity of RNA was determined by measuring A260 nm with an Utrospec 3000 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). Approximately 2 μg of mantle total RNA was used as template for first-strand cDNA synthesis using the BD Power-Script™ Reverse Transcriptase (Clontech) for subsequent rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) 3The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; anti-Prisilkin-39, specific antibody against Prisilkin-39; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; SEM, scanning electron microscope; ESM, EDTA-soluble matrix; EISM, EDTA-insoluble matrix. reactions. Construction of Mantle cDNA Library—Poly(A)+ RNA from the mantle tissue of P. fucata was extracted using the poly(A) tract mRNA isolation system (Promega Corp.). Double-stranded cDNA was generated using ∼5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA. The cDNA was subsequently ligated into the Uni-ZAP XR Vector and packaged with the Gigpack III Gold extract (Stratagene). Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends and Sequence Analyses—3′-RACE and 5′-RACE were carried out with a BD SMART™RACE cDNA amplification kit and Advantage 2 cDNA polymerase mix (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3′-RACE was performed using the first-strand cDNA and the primer pair of UPM (Clontech) and a degenerate sense primer YGS-F1 (5′-GGN TAY GGN GGN TAYNG-3′, N = A/G/C/T; Y = C/T). The primer YGS-F1 was designed based on the amino acid sequence GYGGYG containing the repetitive motif GYGG of KRMP, the prismatic layer framework matrix protein of P. fucata. Full-length cDNA was amplified by 5′-RACE using the primer pair of UPM and a gene-specific antisense primer YGS-R1 (5′-AAC TAT ACC CTG AAC GCA TTC CAC C-3′) designed from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment determined by 3′-RACE. All PCR-amplified products were selectively purified with Wizard PCR Prep DNA purification system (Promega) and subcloned into the pMD 19-T vector (Takara) for sequencing. To confirm cloning and sequencing accuracy, the entire cDNA was re-amplified with high fidelity polymerase (Takara) and the P. fucata mantle cDNA library as template, using the set of primers of the gene-specific primer YGS-F2 (5′-TTC ACT GCA GTT TCG AAC TAC-3′) and T7 (reverse primer, corresponding to the T7 promoter on the Uni-ZAP vector). The purified PCR products were subcloned into pMD 19-T vector followed by re-sequencing. Gene Expression Analysis by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated as described above from different tissues, including the mantle edge, the mantle pallial, gonad, foot, gill, hemocytes, viscus, and adductor muscle of adult individual of P. fucata. Equal quantities (1 μg) of total RNA from different tissues were reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was conducted using the primer pairs of YGS-T1 (5′-ATG CGT TCA GGG TAT AGT TAT TAC AGC-3′) and YGS-T2 (5′-TAC TAC CAG AAC TGT AAT ATG ATG G-3′), and gapdhF (5′-GCC GAG TAT GTG GTA GAA TC-3′) and gapdhR (5′-CAC TGT TTT CTG GGT AGC TG-3′) for amplification of Prisilkin-39 and GAPDH (included as a positive control for cDNA preparations) gene fragment, respectively. To avoid false-positive results and detect the cross-contamination of the samples, a negative control was performed in the absence of cDNA template. All PCR products were subcloned and verified by sequencing. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization of Prisilkin-39 mRNA was carried out on frozen sections of the mantle tissue that had been fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (Sigma) overnight. The digoxigenin-labeled probe was generated from the 361-bp fragment amplified with the primer pair of YGS-T1 and YGS-T2 by using a High Prime DIG random labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The procedures of hybridization were mainly performed as described previously with some modifications (29Huang W. Yao B. Sun L. Pu R. Wang L. Zhang R. Life Sci... 2001; 68: 1727-1734Google Scholar). Preparation of Polyclonal Antibodies against the Recombinant Prisilkin-39—Construction of expression vector pPIC9/Pf-Prisilkin-39 was performed as described in the Pichia expression kit (Invitrogen) manual. Recombinant Prisilkin-39 with a His tag at the N terminus was overexpressed in yeast, Pichia pastoris GS115, after 2 days of induction, and then purified from the medium by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Ni-NTA affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). Elution fractions containing recombinant Prisilkin-39 detected by SDS-PAGE were concentrated and desalted by ultrafiltration (Millipore, cut-off 5 kDa) against 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Polyclonal antibodies against Prisilkin-39 (anti-Prisilkin-39) were raised in New Zealand rabbits following standard immunization procedures and then affinity-purified from nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (30Fan X. Hou J. Chen X. Chaudhry F. Staiger C.J. Ren H. Plant Physiol... 2004; 136: 3979-3989Google Scholar). The titer was determined by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (31Clark M.F. Adams A.N. J. Gen. Virol... 1977; 34: 475-483Google Scholar). In addition, the specificity of the antibodies was tested on Western blots against the purified protein, the polyhistidine, and the EDTA-insoluble matrix extracted from the entire shell of P. fucata. Shell Preparation and Matrix Extraction—Cleaned shells of P. fucata were immersed in 5% sodium hydroxide for 12 h and subsequently rinsed in distilled water to avoid possible contamination of the shell matrix by soft tissues that could have adhered to the inner surface of nacre. The two layers of the shells, the outer calcitic prismatic layer and the inner aragonitic nacreous layer, were separated mechanically by abrasion before air-drying. Their respective fragments were pulverized (30 g, particle size <100 μm) and then decalcified with 0.5 m sodium EDTA (Merck) for 60 h at 4 °C with continuous stirring. For extraction of the soluble matrix, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, then desalted by ultrafiltration (Amicon, YM50) under nitrogen, and lyophilized. The pellets were thoroughly rinsed with water and treated with denaturing solution (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol) at 100 °C for 15 min. After a short centrifugation, the denatured samples were ready to be applied on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Extracts of the entire shell were also obtained in the same manner. The amount of the protein was measured by a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Detection of Native Prisilkin-39 in Different Shell Extracts and Tissues—Analysis of the existence of native Prisilkin-39 in EDTA extracts of the prismatic layer and the nacreous layer of P. fucata was conducted by a combination of ELISA, dot-blot testing, and Western blotting, using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies. For the dot-blot test, solutions containing the extracts of shell matrix were serially diluted with the same buffer and then vacuum-blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with the antibodies and then treated as a normal blot. For ELISA, known amounts (100 pg to 3 ng of Prisilkin-39) were used as a standard. The tests were repeated three times in triplicate. Tissues, i.e. mantle, gill, gonad, viscus, foot, and adductor muscle, were homogenized, and the total proteins were extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manual. Homolymph and extrapallial fluid were extracted directly from oyster P. fucata by sucking the fluid gently using a sterile syringe. Protein samples with an equal quantity (30 μg) were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using the Multiphor II Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). Purified polyclonal antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:100, and alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Calbiochem) at 1:2000. The blot was finally visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Applied Science). In Situ Immunofluorescence Location of Native Prisilkin-39—Immunofluorescence staining was performed according to Nudelman et al. (32Nudelman F. Gotliv B.A. Addadi L. Weiner S. J. Struct. Biol... 2006; 153: 176-187Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After being washed and sonicated in distilled water for 10 min, a cross-section of the shell was incubated in a solution of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 4% formaldehyde and 0.5% cetylpyridinium chloride at room temperature with gentle shaking for 3 days. After complete decalcification, the samples were thoroughly washed with Milli-Q water and blocked in 10% goat serum for 2 h. The samples were then incubated in serum containing polyclonal antibodies produced against recombinant Prisilkin-39 or preimmune serum. In both cases the serum was diluted 1:50 in PBS and contained bovine serum albumin 0.25% w/v (Sigma) to block nonspecific binding. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min, the second antibody, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, diluted 1:1000 in PBS) was applied to the samples for 30 min. Rhodamine-labeled samples were washed with PBS, rinsed in water, and examined with differential interference contrast microscopy and fluorescence microscopy (Leica, DMIRB). Chitin Binding Assay—Chitin binding assays were done as described by Inoue et al. (33Inoue H. Ozaki N. Nagasawa H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem... 2001; 65: 1840-1848Google Scholar) with some modifications. Recombinant Prisilkin-39 or BSA (each 30 μg) as a negative control was dissolved in 50 μl of 0.5% ammonium bicarbonate, and the resulting solution was incubated with 5 mg of chitin (Wako) that had previously been equilibrated with 0.5% ammonium bicarbonate for 20 h at 4 °C in an Eppendorf tube. After removal of the solution by centrifugation, the insoluble mixture was successively washed with 200 μl each of distilled water and 0.2 m NaCl. Each washing was desalted by ultrafiltration (Millipore, 5-kDa cutoff) and lyophilized, and freeze-dried proteins were resuspended directly in 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The final insoluble residue was boiled in 30 μl of 2% (w/v) SDS containing 20% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min, and then the supernatant was separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. Each washing or supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In Vitro Crystallization Assay—Two types of crystallizing solutions were prepared to investigate the effect of Prisilkin-39 on the morphology and polymorphism of calcium carbonate crystals. Saturated calcium bicarbonate solution for calcite crystallization was prepared according to Xu et al. (34Xu G. Yao N. Aksay I.A. Groves J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 1998; 120: 11977-11985Google Scholar). A stirred aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate was aerated with CO2 for 4 h, and the excess solid calcium carbonate was removed by filtration (0.2 μm). An aragonitic crystallizing solution was obtained by the addition of 50 mm magnesium chloride to the former solution. Crystallization experiments were carried out by adding samples to the freshly prepared filtrate on siliconized glass slides at 20 °C. The slides were placed into a sealed box with a sheet of wet paper to prevent evaporation. After 24 h, the crystallization solution was removed, and the crystals were stored in a desiccator for characterization. Inhibition of Calcium Carbonate Precipitation and Calcium Binding Assay—The effect of Prisilkin-39 on calcium carbonate precipitation from its supersaturated solution was examined according to the method of Suzuki et al. (13Suzuki M. Murayama E. Inoue H. Ozaki N. Tohse H. Kogure T. Nagasawa H. Biochem. J... 2004; 382: 205-213Google Scholar). Briefly, sample solution (10 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of 30 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5. After the addition of 100 μl of 30 mm CaCl2 to the mixed solution, the formation of CaCO3 precipitates was monitored by recording the turbidity. Changes in the turbidity of the solutions were measured every minute for 5 min by the absorbance at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer. The calcium-binding capacity of Prisilkin-39 was analyzed according to the Stains-All method (35Marin F. Amons R. Guichard N. Stigter M. Hecker A. Luquet G. Layrolle P. Alcaraz G. Riondet C. Westbroek P. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 33895-33908Google Scholar). Gels were run, extensively washed with 25% isopropyl alcohol, and then stained in the dark for 4 days with 0.0025% Stains-All, 25% isopropyl alcohol, 7.5% formamide, and 30 mm Tris base, pH 8.8. Calmodulin, a calcium-binding protein (36Li S. Xie L. Zhang C. Zhang Y. Gu M. Zhang R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol... 2004; 138: 235-243Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. A calcium-dependent electrophoretic shift assay was carried out according to the method of Burgess et al. (37Burgess W.H. Jemiolo D.K. Kretsinger R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1980; 623: 257-270Google Scholar). Protein Labeling with Rhodamine and Crystal Binding Experiment—Protein labeling with rhodamine and protein-crystal binding experiments were performed as described previously (38Ma Z. Huang J. Sun J. Wang G. Li C. Xie L. Zhang R. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 23253-23263Google Scholar). In Vivo Antibody Inhibition Assay—The purified antibodies were injected into the extrapallial space through the zone of the mantle tissue outside the pallial line at the dosage of 0.5 μg (low dosage) and 1 μg (high dosage) per g of wet weight per day. Five specimens in each group were sacrificed 3 days after antibody injection. The shells were separated, washed with Milli-Q water, and immersed in 5% NaOH for 12 h to remove organic components attached to the inner surface. The shells were thoroughly washed with Milli-Q water, air-dried, gold-coated, and observed under a SEM. Crystal Characterization—For morphological observation and identification of the induced crystals, Raman spectra, SEM, and fluorescence microscopy were used. The Raman spectra of the crystals were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 514 nm, which was provided by an argon laser limited to 4.6-milliwatt power. The spectra were scanned three times for 20 s in the range of 100-1400 cm-1 with a Renishaw RM2000 spectrometer. The scanning electron micrographs were obtained using a FEI Sirion2000 SEM equipped with an energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy system for element analysis of crystals. For rhodamine-labeled crystals, a fluorescence microscope (Leica, DMR) was used. Isolation and Sequence Analysis of cDNA for Prisilkin-39—A fragment of 1000 bp was obtained by the 3′-RACE procedure with degenerate primer YGS-F1. Subsequent sequencing analysis revealed that the degenerate primer YGS-F1 had annealed to the sequence of cDNA encoding GYGGYS. Based on this 3′ sequence, a gene-specific antisense primer YGS-R1 was synthesized, and the full-length cDNA was obtained by the 5′-RACE procedure. To confirm the sequence expected from the results of 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE, another amplification of the full-length cDNA was performed using the P. fucata mantle cDNA library as a template. A positive cDNA clone YGS7 was obtained, and the final confirmed sequence, including the poly(A) tail, turned out to be 1401 bp in length (Fig. 1). It contains a 59-base 5′-untranslated sequence, an open reading frame consisting of 1218 bp, an in-frame stop codon TAA, and a 121-base 3′-untranslated sequence. The context of the first start codon at nucleotide 60, with a purine (A) three nucleotides upstream, is compatible with the Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of transcription in eukaryotic species (39Kozak M. J. Cell Biol... 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar, 40Kozak M. Mamm. Genome.. 1996; 7: 563-574Google Scholar). Within this cDNA sequence, a putative polyadenylation signal AATAAT is recognized at the nucleotide position 1305, which is 76 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail. Characterization of Deduced Amino Acid Sequence of Prisilkin-39—The deduced protein Prisilkin-39 encompasses 406 amino acid residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 39.3 kDa before any post-translational modification. Prisilkin-39 is characterized by high proportions of Gly (29.7%), Tyr (23.3%), and Ser (18.6%), which together accounted for more than 70% of the total amino acid residues (Table 1). In addition, the amino acid composition of Prisilkin-39 is also comparable with that of crude matrix proteins from the prismatic layer of P. fucata (41Wada K. Bull. Natl. Pearl Res. Lab... 1966; 20: 2209-2213Google Scholar). In contrast to many other shell matrix proteins singularly enriched in Asp and Glu residues (12Tsukamoto D. Sarashina I. Endo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Addadi L. Weiner S. ChemBioChem.. 2005; 6: 304-314Google Scholar), the occurrence of these acidic amino acids in Prisilkin-39 is markedly low, with only one Asp residue. Thus, Prisilkin-39 belongs to the rare group of basic matrix proteins with a theoretical pI of 8.83.Table 1Amino acid composition of Prisilkin-39, KR"
https://openalex.org/W1975040447,"Cells are equipped with an efficient quality control system to selectively eliminate abnormally folded and damaged proteins. Initially the cell tries to refold the unfolded proteins with the help of molecular chaperones, and failure to refold leads to their degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system. But how this proteolytic machinery recognizes the abnormally folded proteins is poorly understood. Here, we report that E6-AP, a HECT domain family ubiquitin ligase implicated in Angelman syndrome, interacts with the substrate binding domain of Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperones and promotes the degradation of chaperone bound substrates. The expression of E6-AP was dramatically induced under a variety of stresses, and overexpression of E6-AP was found to protect against endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell death. The inhibition of proteasome function not only increases the expression of E6-AP but also causes its redistribution around microtubule-organizing center, a subcellular structure for the degradation of the cytoplasmic misfolded proteins. E6-AP is also recruited to aggresomes containing the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or expanded polyglutamine proteins. Finally, we demonstrate that E6-AP ubiquitinates misfolded luciferase that is bound by Hsp70. Our results suggest that E6-AP functions as a cellular quality control ubiquitin ligase and, therefore, can be implicated not only in the pathogenesis of Angelman syndrome but also in the biology of neurodegenerative disorders involving protein aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2083739951,"Although over 1400 Salmonella serovars cause usually self-limited gastroenteritis in humans, a few, e.g., Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi C, cause typhoid, a potentially fatal systemic infection. It is not known whether the typhoid agents have evolved from a common ancestor (by divergent processes) or acquired similar pathogenic traits independently (by convergent processes). Comparison of different typhoid agents with non-typhoidal Salmonella lineages will provide excellent models for studies on how similar pathogens might have evolved.We sequenced a strain of S. paratyphi C, RKS4594, and compared it with previously sequenced Salmonella strains. RKS4594 contains a chromosome of 4,833,080 bp and a plasmid of 55,414 bp. We predicted 4,640 intact coding sequences (4,578 in the chromosome and 62 in the plasmid) and 152 pseudogenes (149 in the chromosome and 3 in the plasmid). RKS4594 shares as many as 4346 of the 4,640 genes with a strain of S. choleraesuis, which is primarily a swine pathogen, but only 4008 genes with another human-adapted typhoid agent, S. typhi. Comparison of 3691 genes shared by all six sequenced Salmonella strains placed S. paratyphi C and S. choleraesuis together at one end, and S. typhi at the opposite end, of the phylogenetic tree, demonstrating separate ancestries of the human-adapted typhoid agents. S. paratyphi C seemed to have suffered enormous selection pressures during its adaptation to man as suggested by the differential nucleotide substitutions and different sets of pseudogenes, between S. paratyphi C and S. choleraesuis.S. paratyphi C does not share a common ancestor with other human-adapted typhoid agents, supporting the convergent evolution model of the typhoid agents. S. paratyphi C has diverged from a common ancestor with S. choleraesuis by accumulating genomic novelty during adaptation to man."

https://openalex.org/W2068077937,"Background Although transition from proliferation to hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes is a crucial step for endochondral ossification in physiological skeletal growth and pathological disorders like osteoarthritis, the underlying mechanism remains an enigma. This study investigated the role of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) in chondrocytes during endochondral ossification. Methodology/Principal Findings Mouse embryos with homozygous deficiency in C/EBPβ (C/EBPβ−/−) exhibited dwarfism with elongated proliferative zone and delayed chondrocyte hypertrophy in the growth plate cartilage. In the cultures of primary C/EBPβ−/− chondrocytes, cell proliferation was enhanced while hypertrophic differentiation was suppressed. Contrarily, retroviral overexpression of C/EBPβ in chondrocytes suppressed the proliferation and enhanced the hypertrophy, suggesting the cell cycle arrest by C/EBPβ. In fact, a DNA cell cycle histogram revealed that the C/EBPβ overexpression caused accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 fraction. Among cell cycle factors, microarray and real-time RT-PCR analyses have identified the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57Kip2 as the transcriptional target of C/EBPβ. p57Kip2 was co-localized with C/EBPβ in late proliferative and pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes of the mouse growth plate, which was decreased by the C/EBPβ deficiency. Luciferase-reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified the core responsive element of C/EBPβ in the p57Kip2 promoter between −150 and −130 bp region containing a putative C/EBP motif. The knockdown of p57Kip2 by the siRNA inhibited the C/EBPβ-induced chondrocyte hypertrophy. Finally, when we created the experimental osteoarthritis model by inducing instability in the knee joints of adult mice of wild-type and C/EBPβ+/− littermates, the C/EBPβ insufficiency caused resistance to joint cartilage destruction. Conclusions/Significance C/EBPβ transactivates p57Kip2 to promote transition from proliferation to hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes during endochondral ossification, suggesting that the C/EBPβ-p57Kip2 signal would be a therapeutic target of skeletal disorders like growth retardation and osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2085113272,"Dietary restriction (DR) increases mammalian lifespan and decreases susceptibility to many age-related diseases. Lifespan extension due to DR is conserved across a wide range of species. Recent research has focused upon genetically tractable model organisms such as C. elegans to uncover the genetic mechanisms that regulate the response to DR, in the hope that this information will provide insight into the mammalian response and yield potential therapeutic targets. However, no consensus exists as to the best protocol to apply DR to C. elegans and potential key regulators of DR are protocol-specific. Here we define a DR method that better fulfills criteria required for an invertebrate DR protocol to mirror mammalian studies. The food intake that maximizes longevity varies for different genotypes and informative epistasis analysis with another intervention is only achievable at this 'optimal DR' level. Importantly therefore, the degree of restriction imposed using our method can easily be adjusted to determine the genotype-specific optimum DR level. We used this protocol to test two previously identified master regulators of DR in the worm. In contrast to previous reports, we find that DR can robustly extend the lifespan of worms lacking the AMP-activated protein kinase catalytic subunit AAK2 or the histone deacetylase SIR-2.1, highlighting the importance of first optimizing DR to identify universal regulators of DR mediated longevity."

(Tokyo).. 1988; 41: 1711-1739Google Scholar), including a nucleoside skeleton and two modified amino acids, polyoximic acid (POIA) 3The abbreviations used are: POIA, polyoximic acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; 3′-EUMP, 3′-enolpyruvyl-UMP; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; CPOAA, carbamoylpolyoxamic acid; AHV, α-amino-δ-hydroxyvaleric acid; ACV, α-amino-δ-carbamoylhydroxyvaleric acid; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. and carbamoylpolyoxamic acid (CPOAA) (2Isono K.

Isotope feeding experiments demonstrated that the nucleoside skeleton was initiated using uridine and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as substrates, and the two modified amino acids originated from l-isoleucine and l-glutamate (1Isono K. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo).. 1988; 41: 1711-1739Google Scholar) independently. Reports on the cloning of biosynthetic gene clusters for nucleoside antibiotics were limited to complete pathways for a purine nucleoside antibiotic puromycin (7Lacalle R.A. Tercero J.A. Jimenez A. EMBO J... 1992; 11: 785-792Google Scholar), a pyrimidine nucleoside antibiotic nikkomycin, as well as a partial pyrimidine nucleoside antibiotic blasticidin S (8Cone M.C. Yin X. Grochowski L.L. Parker M.R. Zabriskie T.M. ChemBioChem.. 2003; 4: 821-828Google Scholar). Whereas the puromycin biosynthetic pathway was completely demonstrated, the biosynthetic mechanism for blasticidin S was incompletely understood. A tentative biosynthetic pathway for nikkomycin Z (Fig. 1B), produced by Streptomyces tendae Tü901 (1Isono K. J. Antibiot.

Mathews F.S. Structure (Lond.).. 2007; 15: 928-941Google Scholar) to derive from two moieties involving a nucleoside skeleton and a modified amino acid originating from l-tyrosine, but the precise mechanism for the biosynthesis of its nucleoside skeleton, which seemed similar to polyoxin, remains to be clarified (16Ginj C. Ruegger H. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. ChemBioChem.. 2005; 6: 1974-1976Google Scholar). NikO, a key enzyme essential for biosynthesis of the nikkomycin nucleoside skeleton, was recently demonstrated to use UMP, instead of uridine, with PEP to form a novel and unexpected product 3′-enolpyruvyl-UMP (3′-EUMP) (16Ginj C. Ruegger H. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. ChemBioChem.. 2005; 6: 1974-1976Google Scholar). This is totally different from the previously proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of the polyoxin nucleoside skeleton. Here we describe the cloning and functional analysis of a complete polyoxin biosynthetic gene cluster. The heterologous production of polyoxin H in a nonproducer, Streptomyces lividans TK24, helped us to pinpoint an essential region consisting of 20 putative pol genes of 39 predicted open reading frames in a sequenced region as large as 46 kb, which led to a proposal of putative pathway for polyoxin biosynthesis. The availability of these genes will significantly help the elucidation of the exact biosynthetic mechanism of polyoxin, and for the more rational generation of polyoxin derivatives with novel or enhanced bioactivities via strategies involving pathway engineering or combinatorial biosynthesis. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids (Cosmids), General Methods, and Culture Conditions—Bacterial strains and plasmids (cosmids) used are described in supplemental Table S1. S. cacaoi and its derivatives were grown on MS agar (18Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Butter M.J. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics, 2nd Ed..John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK. 2000; : 169-170Google Scholar) or in TSB liquid medium (18Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Butter M.J. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics, 2nd Ed..John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK. 2000; : 169-170Google Scholar) at 30 °C. Liquid fermentation medium (containing the following per liter: 20 g of soy powder, 15 g of corn powder, 10 g of glucose, 10 g of yeast extract, 4 g of CaCO3, 2 g of KH2PO4, 2 g of NaCl) was used for polyoxin production. General approaches for Escherichia coli or Streptomyces manipulation were according to the standard methods of Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed..Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar) or Kieser et al. (18Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Butter M.J. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics, 2nd Ed..John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK. 2000; : 169-170Google Scholar). The final antibiotic concentrations used for selection of E. coli or Streptomyces were as follows: 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml apramycin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 12.5 μg/ml thiostrepton. Milli-Q water purified by Milli-Q® ultrapure water purification systems was used throughout except for medium preparation. PCR Primers, DNA Probes, and Southern Blot—PCR primers used are listed in supplemental Table S2. For Southern blot experiments, S. cacaoi genomic DNA was digested with specific restriction enzymes, separated on 0.7% agarose gels overnight, and transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). With use of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled radioactive probes by the random priming kit (Takara), Southern blot experiments were performed based on the standard protocol by Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed..Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar). Genomic Library Construction for S. cacaoi and the Strategy for Screening Positive Cosmids—For construction of the pOJ446-derived genomic library for S. cacaoi, the standard method (18Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Butter M.J. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics, 2nd Ed..John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK. 2000; : 169-170Google Scholar, 19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed..Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar) was adopted, and the competent EPI300-T1R E. coli was selected as host. For screening the cosmid genomic library by PCR, the primers (PolAF and PolAR) were used, and cosmid (mix) was used as template. The positive clones were identified in 96-well plates. Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number—The nucleotide sequence reported in this paper is available in the GenBank™ data base under accession number EU158805. DNA Sequencing and Sequence Analysis—DNA sequencing was accomplished at Invitrogen using pIJ2925 (18Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Butter M.J. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics, 2nd Ed..John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK. 2000; : 169-170Google Scholar) as vector, and sequencing reactions were carried out in an Applied Biosystems model 3730 automated DNA sequencer. Sequence data analysis was performed with FramePlot 3.0beta online program (20Ishikawa J. Hotta K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett... 1999; 174: 251-253Google Scholar). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology searches were performed using BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol... 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). Heterologous Production of Polyoxin H—For heterologous production of polyoxin in S. lividans TK24, an EcoRI-XbaI engineered fragment bearing the int gene and the attp site from pSET152 was amplified by PCR with primers 5a7mF and 5a7mR, and this engineered fragment was used to replace the corresponding region in cosmid 5A7 containing the unstable SCP2 replicon to generate the modified 5A7 (m5A7), which was introduced into S. lividans TK24 for the engineered production of polyoxin. Construction and Identification of a polA Mutant—For construction of a polA targeted disruption vector, an ∼3.0-kb PvuII fragment harboring polA from cosmid 8B9 was cloned into the SmaI site of pIJ2925 to generate pJTU2158. With the primers Podf and Podr carrying XbaI and EcoRI site individually, the ∼3.0-kb fragment was amplified by KOD-plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo) using pJTU2158 as template; subsequently, this XbaI-EcoRI engineered fragment was cloned into pJTU1278, 4H. E. Yunlong, unpublished data. a derivative of pHZ1358 (22Sun Y. Zhou X. Liu J. Bao K. Zhang G. Tu G. Kieser T. Deng Z. Microbiology.. 2002; 148: 361-371Google Scholar), to give pJTU2161, and a BamHI fragment containing aac(3)IV (apramycin resistance gene) from pHZ1070 (23Li W. Ying X. Guo Y. Yu Z. Zhou X. Deng Z. Kieser H. Chater K.F. Tao M. J. Bacteriol... 2006; 188: 8368-8375Google Scholar) was inserted into the internal counterpart site of polA in pJTU2161 to produce the polA targeted disruption vector pJTU2165. Both PCR and Southern blot experiments were carried out to identify the CY1 mutants. For PCR identification, the primers PiomF and PiomR were used. The additional Southern blot validation used an ∼0.7-kb polA fragment obtained from pJTU2152 as a probe. Complementation of a Mutant CY1 with nikO and polA—With primers NikO-EXF and NikO-EXR, the complete nikO structural gene (with start codon GTG changed to ATG) was amplified with KOD-plus polymerase, treated with EcoRI, and then cloned into pIJ2925 (cleaved with EcoRI and SmaI) to generate pJTU2173. With primers polAef and polAer, the polA structural gene (with start codon GTG changed to ATG) was amplified, cut with EcoRI, and inserted into pBluescript II (SK+) (digested with EcoRI and SmaI) to produce pJTU2810. Two sequencing-confirmed EcoRI-NdeI fragments harboring the structural genes nikO from pJTU2173 and polA from pJTU2810, respectively, were cloned into the corresponding sites of pJTU695 (24Bai L. Li L. Xu H. Minagawa K. Yu Y. Zhang Y. Zhou X. Floss H.G. Mahmud T. Deng Z. Chem. Biol... 2006; 13: 387-397Google Scholar) to form pJTU2179 and pJTU2198. Construction and Identification of a polO Mutant—A 4.1-kb PvuII fragment from cosmid 5A7 containing intact polO was cloned into pBlueScriptII SK(+) to generate pJTU2900, from which a HindIII-SpeI fragment was cloned into the HindIII-XbaI site of pJTU1289 4H. E. Yunlong, unpublished data. to give pJTU2940, and an aac(3)IV+oriT cassette was recombined into the pJTU2940 by PCR targeting technology (25Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2003; 100: 1541-1546Google Scholar) to produce pJTU2941 as a vector for polO disruption. Primers (polOIDF and polOIDR) were used for the identification of polO mutant. Polyoxin Purification and Assay—Polyoxin produced by S. cacaoi var. asoensis and its derivatives was detected by bioassay, HPLC (Waters 220), and LC/MS (Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD Trap system). For the bioassay, Trichosporon cutaneum was used as indicator strain. For HPLC and LC/MS analysis, the prepared broth containing polyoxin was purified by Dowex 50W×8(H+) resin, and the targeted fraction was collected and condensed before HPLC and LC/MS analysis. The conditions for HPLC analysis were according to the method of Fiedler (26Fiedler H.P. J. Chromatogr... 1984; 316: 487-494Google Scholar) except that the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The elution was monitored at 263.6 nm with a PDA (DAD) detector, and the data were analyzed with Waters Millennium Chromatography Manager (Agilent data analysis software). Quantification of Polyoxin H/A—For quantification of polyoxin H/A, polyoxin H/A standards were independently prepared by Shimadzu LC-8A preparative liquid chromatography. The HPLC conditions were as follows: 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid was increased to 50% in 30 min, and acetonitrile was correspondingly decreased to 50%; flow rate was 5 ml/min; after that, the standard curve was drawn according HPLC peak area of series polyoxin H/A concentrations (50, 100, 200, and 500 μg/ml, respectively) (see above for HPLC under ""Polyoxin Purification and Assay”) before the quantity of the polyoxin H/A in crude broth was calculated. Conditions for MS Analysis—The ion trap mass spectrometer (Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD trap system was operated with the electrospray ionization source) analysis for polyoxin and ACV (AHV) was in positive mode and for 3′-EUMP (UMP) in negative mode. The parameters for all MS analysis are as follows: drying gas flow was 10 liters/ml, and nebulizer pressure was 30 p.s.i.; drying gas temperature was 325 °C. Heterologous Overexpression of Recombinant His6-tagged PolA, NikO, and PolO—For heterologous expression of PolA, NikO, and PolO in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysE (Stratagene), both EcoRI-NdeI fragments harboring the structural genes nikO from pJTU2173, polA from pJTU2810, and polO from pJTU2896 were individually cloned into the corresponding sites of pET28a (Stratagene) to obtain pJTU2178, pJTU2197, and pET28a/polO. The plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pLysE. The transformants were grown in 600 ml of LB medium containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol at 37 °C to A600 of 0.6 before addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the incubation was continued at 30 °C for 3 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet resuspended in 60 ml of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was stored frozen at -70 °C until further use. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts and Purification of His6-tagged PolA, NikO, and PolO—After thawing in water, the E. coli cells were lysed by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for at least 30 min. Recombinant His-tagged protein was purified from the supernatant by gravity-flow chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The bound recombinant protein was then eluted off the nickel column with gradient elution buffer (500 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min by Amersham Biosciences ÄKTA FPLC, and glycerol was added to the purified protein to a final concentration of 10% to prevent precipitation. After that, the purified recombinant protein was aliquoted and stored at -70 °C. In Vitro Enzyme Assay for PolA and NikO—In vitro characterization of PolA and NikO was according to the method of Ginj et al. (16Ginj C. Ruegger H. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. ChemBioChem.. 2005; 6: 1974-1976Google Scholar). The LC/MS analysis conditions used to judge the enzyme-catalyzed product were as follows: 91% of 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid, 9% of methanol, flow rate 0.3 ml/min. Compounds were analyzed by recording the absorbancy at 260 nm (for UMP and 3′-EUMP). Before injection of samples into LC/MS, protein was precipitated by adding an equal volume of 14% trichloroacetic acid to the reaction mix. In Vitro Enzyme Assay for PolO—In vitro enzyme assay of PolO was carried out at 30 °C overnight (under the following conditions: 200 μl volume containing phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 50 mm, AHV 1 mm, MgSO4 5 mm, ATP 2 mm, dithiothreitol 2 mm, carbamoylphosphate 1 mm, PolO 10 μm). Before LC/MS analysis, protein was precipitated using the conditions described above, and the LC/MS analysis conditions used to judge the enzyme-catalyzed product were as follows: 90% of 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid, 10% of acetonitrile, flow rate 0.3 ml/min. The procedure for TLC analysis of PolO-catalyzed product was as follows: PolO-catalyzed product was initially purified by Dowex 50W×8(H+), separated by TLC with the solvent system butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:2), and visualized by ninhydrin solution (1.5 g of ninhydrin dissolved in 100 ml of butanol and 3 ml of acetic acid). Synthesis of AHV—Synthesis of AHV was according to method of Garcia et al. (27Garcia M. Serra A. Rubiralta M. Diez A. Segarra V. Lozoya E. Ryder H. Palacios J.M. Tetrahedron Asymmetry.. 2000; 11: 991-994Google Scholar). The synthesized AHV was confirmed by 1H NMR (D2O, 400 MHz) δ 3.58 (t, J = 5.6 Hz, 1H), 3.45 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 2H), 1.70–1.77 (m, 2H), 1.38–1.51 (m, 2H). Genetic Organization of the Cloned Polyoxin Gene Cluster—When an ∼0.7-kb nikO fragment from S. tendae Tü901 for the nikkomycin biosynthesis was amplified with primers NikOTF and NikOTR for use to probe the BamHI-digested genomic DNA of the two polyoxin producers (S. cacaoi var. asoensis and S. aureochromogenes (4Wen Z. Chinese J. Biol... 2004; 21: 36-37Google Scholar)) at low stringency, weak hybridization signals at ∼1.6 and ∼3.5 kb, respectively (see supplemental Fig. S1), appeared, which indicates that both strains may contain nikO homologs. To isolate a nikO homolog as a probe for screening cosmids from a genomic library of S. cacaoi, a distinct PCR product of 723 bp, deduced to encode a 240-amino acid NikO homolog, was first amplified from S. aureochromogenes using specific primers NikOTF and NikOTR, from which another pair of primers (PolAf and PolAr) was designed for the amplification of a 549-bp PCR product simultaneously from S. cacaoi and S. aureochromogenes. Both PCR products showed 99% identity within the shared 549-bp region. A pOJ446-derived cosmid library was screened by PCR (see ""Experimental Procedures”). Of ∼2,000 cosmids, 8 gave positive signals, which spanned ∼65-kb contiguous region of S. cacaoi as revealed by mapping with PvuII (Fig. 2A). A contiguous 46,066-bp sequenced region arising from sequencing one of the centrally located cosmids 5A7 (∼35 kb), and subsequently an additional XhoI (4.8 kb) and two internal PvuII (1.5 and 6.7 kb) fragments (GenBank™ accession number EU158805, Fig. 2A), had an overall G + C content of 72.58%, similar to that of a typical Streptomyces genome exemplified by Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) (28Bentley S.D.

The frame plot 3.0 beta online program revealed 39 complete open reading frames whose organization is shown in Fig. 2B, with putative functions described in Table 1.Table 1Deduced functions of the open reading frames in the pol gene cluster Protein Amino acids Proposed function Homolog, origin Identity, similarity Accession no. % PolB 257 Thymidylate synthase SCO5743, S. coelicolor A3(2) 60, 72 NP_629868 PolAaFunctions were confirmed in vitro 445 UMP-enolpyruvyltransferase NikO, S. tendae 62, 71 CAC80913 PolQ2 188 Adenylate kinase NikN, S. tendae 59, 68 CAC80912 PolQ1 419 Membrane protein NikN, S. tendae 47, 61 CAC80912 PolP 280 Acetylglutamate kinase SCO1578, S. coelicolor A3(2) 55, 68 NP_625855 PolOaFunctions were confirmed in vitro 573 Carbamoyltransferase NodU, Sinorhizobium sp. 49, 64 CAH04371 PolN 168 Amino acid N-acetyltransferase ArgA, Rhodoferax ferrireducens 30, 46 YP_523360 PolM 255 Short chain dehydrogenase PA4907, P. aeruginosa PAO1 49, 67 NP_253594 PolL 243 Unknown ORF3, Agrobacterium vitis 35, 51 ABG82019 PolK 213 Hydroxylase SanC, S. ansochromogenes 58, 69 AAF61921 PolJ 273 Phosphatase SanB, S. ansochromogenes 63, 71 AAF61216 PolI 380 Aminotransferase NikK, S. tendae 61, 69 CAC80909 PolH 469 Radical S-adenosylmethionine protein NikJ, S. tendae 70, 80 CAC80908 PolG 430 Amide synthetase NikS, Streptomyces tendae 57, 70 CAC11141 PolF 275 Molybdopterin oxidoreductase Aave_0767, Acidovorx avenae subsp. citrulli 28, 41 YP_969139 PolE 370 Unknown SAML1083, Streptomyces ambofaciens 30, 46 CAJ90069 PolD 215 Hydroxylase NikI, S. tendae 50, 65 CAC80907 PolC 204 Hydroxylase SanF, S. ansochromogenes 29, 49 AAF74976 PolY 962 Regulator ORF4, Streptomyces echinatus 39, 53 ABL09952 PolR 1111 Regulator ORFR, S. tendae 55, 66 CAC80806a Functions were confirmed in vitro Open table in a new tab Genes Essential for the Biosynthesis of the Polyoxin Nucleoside Skeleton—Six noncontiguous genes (polA, -D, -H, -I, -J, and -K) were identified as similar to an isolated gene (nikO) and five contiguous genes (nikI-nikM) involved in the biosynthesis of nikkomycin nucleoside skeleton, and were thus deduced to be responsible for the counterpart biosynthesis of the polyoxin nucleoside skeleton. PolA shows significant homology with NikO and SanX (62 and 61% identity, respectively), both independently essential for biosynthesis of nikkomycin in S. tendae Tü901 and S. ansochromogenes (9Liu G. Tian Y. Yang H. Tan H. Mol. Microbiol... 2005; 55: 1855-1866Google Scholar), likely to act as enolpyruvyltransferases (13Lauer B. Sussmuth R. Kaiser D. Jung G. Bormann C. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo).. 2000; 53: 385-392Google Scholar, 16Ginj C. Ruegger H. Amrhein N. Macheroux P. ChemBioChem.. 2005; 6: 1974-1976Google Scholar). PolD exhibits 50% identity and 65% similarity to NikI, but their precise roles in the biosynthesis of the nucleoside skeleton, either for nikkomycin or polyoxin, remain ambiguous. PolH resembles NikJ, a radical S-adenosylmethionine family protein postulated to catalyze diverse reactions, including formation of cyclized intermediate. PolI is 61% identical to NikK, and they both strongly resemble the histidinol-phosphate/aromatic aminotransferase of Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. The significant resemblance of PolJ (with a protein tyrosine/serine phosphatase domain identical to NikL) and PolK (identical to NikM, a hydroxylase) strongly suggests that they should play similar roles in the biosynthesis of the nucleoside skeletons for polyoxin and/or nikkomycin. Genes for the Biosynthesis of CPOAA and POIA—Five genes (polL–P) seem to be involved in CPOAA biosynthesis, of which PolM displayed significant homology with a probable short chain dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, PolN with ∼30% identity to ArgA of Rhodoferax ferrireducens, PolP with considerable homology with the corresponding protein of S. coelicolor A3(2) involved in arginine biosynthesis (30Hindle Z. Callis R. Dowden S. Rudd B.A. Baumberg S. Microbiology.. 1994; 140: 311-320Google Scholar), and PolO with significant homology with NodU, a carbamoyltransferase of Sinorhizobium sp. (31Van Rhijn P. Desair J. Vlassak K. Vanderleyden J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol... 1994; 60: 3615-3623Google Scholar). No obvious PolL homolog was found in the data base. Three genes (polC, -E, and -F) were assumed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of POIA, a distinctive moiety present in polyoxin. PolC exhibits 29% identity with SanF, a putative hydroxylase involved in nikkomycin biosynthesis in S. ansochromogenes (32Chen W. Zeng H. Tan H. Curr. Microbiol... 2000; 41: 312-316Google Scholar), whereas PolE shows no obvious similarity to proteins in the data base. Meanwhile, PolF shows only a marginal homology with Ave_0767 of Acidovorax aveenae as a putative molybdopterin oxidoreductase. Genes for the Modification of C-5 of the Nucleoside Skeleton—The methylation modification is very likely to be governed by PolB as a result of its significant homology with ThyX (a thymidylate synthase) of several bacteria, including those from S. coelicolor A3(2) (60% identity) (28Bentley S.D.

Apart from polB, no other gene(s) related to hydroxylation/carboxylation of the methyl group of the polyoxin nucleoside skeleton was/were identified in the pol gene cluster. Genes Involved in Assembly, Regulation, and Transport—Three moieties, the nucleoside skeleton, CPOAA, and POIA, seem to be independently synthesized and assembled into polyoxin A, likely by PolG showing significant homology with NikS (SanS) (57% identity), a putative amide synthetase with confirmed ATPase activity (33Li Y. Zeng H. Tan H. Curr. Microbiol... 2004; 49: 128-132Google Scholar), as a final step. Two candidate regulatory genes, polY and polR, were identified. polY encodes a putative member of the AfsR family of the two-component response regulators, whereas polR seems to encode a pathway-specific regulator with considerable homology with SanG (OrfR in S. tendae), a positive regulator affecting both nikkomycin biosynthesis and colony d"
https://openalex.org/W1997929840,"Intestinal inflammation is exacerbated by defects in the epithelial barrier and subsequent infiltration of microbes and toxins into the underlying mucosa. Production of chemokines and antimicrobial peptides by an intact epithelium provide the first line of defense against invading organisms. In addition to its antimicrobial actions, human beta defensin-2 (HBD2) may also stimulate the migration of dendritic cells through binding the chemokine receptor CCR6. As human colonic epithelium expresses CCR6, we investigated the potential of HBD2 to stimulate intestinal epithelial migration. Using polarized human intestinal Caco2 and T84 cells and non-transformed IEC6 cells, HBD2 was equipotent to CCL20 in stimulating migration. Neutralizing antibodies confirmed HBD2 and CCL20 engagement to CCR6 were sufficient to induce epithelial cell migration. Consistent with restitution, motogenic concentrations of HBD2 and CCL20 did not induce proliferation. Stimulation with those CCR6 ligands leads to calcium mobilization and elevated active RhoA, phosphorylated myosin light chain, and F-actin accumulation. HBD2 and CCL20 were unable to stimulate migration in the presence of either Rho-kinase or phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors or an intracellular calcium chelator. Together, these data indicate that the canonical wound healing regulatory pathway, along with calcium mobilization, regulates CCR6-directed epithelial cell migration. These findings expand the mechanistic role for chemokines and HBD2 in mucosal inflammation to include immunocyte trafficking and killing of microbes with the concomitant activation of restitutive migration and barrier repair."
https://openalex.org/W2119039530,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is organized in protein-DNA macrocomplexes called nucleoids. Average nucleoids contain 2-8 mtDNA molecules, which are organized by the histone-like mitochondrial transcription factor A. Besides well-characterized constituents, such as single-stranded binding protein or polymerase gamma (Pol gamma), various other proteins with ill-defined functions have been identified. We report for the first time that mammalian nucleoids contain essential enzymes of an integral antioxidant system. Intact nucleoids were isolated with sucrose density gradients from rat and bovine heart as well as human Jurkat cells. Manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) was detected by Western blot in the nucleoid fractions. DNA, mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase (GPx1), and Pol gamma were coimmunoprecipitated with SOD2 from nucleoid fractions, which suggests that an antioxidant system composed of SOD2 and GPx1 are integral constituents of nucleoids. Interestingly, in cultured bovine endothelial cells the association of SOD2 with mtDNA was absent. Using a sandwich filter-binding assay, direct association of SOD2 by salt-sensitive ionic forces with a chemically synthesized mtDNA fragment was demonstrated. Increasing salt concentrations during nucleoid isolation on sucrose density gradients disrupted the association of SOD2 with mitochondrial nucleoids. Our biochemical data reveal that nucleoids contain an integral antioxidant system that may protect mtDNA from superoxide-induced oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W1976061151,"Background In prokaryotes and some eukaryotes, genetic material can be transferred laterally among unrelated lineages and recombined into new host genomes, providing metabolic and physiological novelty. Although the process is usually framed in terms of gene sharing (e.g. lateral gene transfer, LGT), there is little reason to imagine that the units of transfer and recombination correspond to entire, intact genes. Proteins often consist of one or more spatially compact structural regions (domains) which may fold autonomously and which, singly or in combination, confer the protein's specific functions. As LGT is frequent in strongly selective environments and natural selection is based on function, we hypothesized that domains might also serve as modules of genetic transfer, i.e. that regions of DNA that are transferred and recombined between lineages might encode intact structural domains of proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings We selected 1,462 orthologous gene sets representing 144 prokaryotic genomes, and applied a rigorous two-stage approach to identify recombination breakpoints within these sequences. Recombination breakpoints are very significantly over-represented in gene sets within which protein domain-encoding regions have been annotated. Within these gene sets, breakpoints significantly avoid the domain-encoding regions (domons), except where these regions constitute most of the sequence length. Recombination breakpoints that fall within longer domons are distributed uniformly at random, but those that fall within shorter domons may show a slight tendency to avoid the domon midpoint. As we find no evidence for differential selection against nucleotide substitutions following the recombination event, any bias against disruption of domains must be a consequence of the recombination event per se. Conclusions/Significance This is the first systematic study relating the units of LGT to structural features at the protein level. Many genes have been interrupted by recombination following inter-lineage genetic transfer, during which the regions within these genes that encode protein domains have not been preferentially preserved intact. Protein domains are units of function, but domons are not modules of transfer and recombination. Our results demonstrate that LGT can remodel even the most functionally conservative modules within genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2166509335,"It is well established that L-proline has several roles in the biology of trypanosomatids. In Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, this amino acid is involved in energy metabolism, differentiation processes and resistance to osmotic stress. In this study, we analyzed the effects of interfering with L-proline metabolism on the viability and on other aspects of the T. cruzi life cycle using the proline analogue L- thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (T4C). The growth of epimastigotes was evaluated using different concentrations of T4C in standard culture conditions and at high temperature or acidic pH. We also evaluated possible interactions of this analogue with stress conditions such as those produced by nutrient starvation and oxidative stress. T4C showed a dose-response effect on epimastigote growth (IC50 = 0.89±0.02 mM at 28°C), and the inhibitory effect of this analogue was synergistic (p<0.05) with temperature (0.54±0.01 mM at 37°C). T4C significantly diminished parasite survival (p<0.05) in combination with nutrient starvation and oxidative stress conditions. Pre-incubation of the parasites with L-proline resulted in a protective effect against oxidative stress, but this was not seen in the presence of the drug. Finally, the trypomastigote bursting from infected mammalian cells was evaluated and found to be inhibited by up to 56% when cells were treated with non-toxic concentrations of T4C (between 1 and 10 mM). All these data together suggest that T4C could be an interesting therapeutic drug if combined with others that affect, for example, oxidative stress. The data also support the participation of proline metabolism in the resistance to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W1991237874,"Septins are filament-forming GTPases implicated in several cellular functions, including cytokinesis. We previously showed that SEPT2, SEPT9, and SEPT11 colocalize with several bacteria entering into mammalian non-phagocytic cells, and SEPT2 was identified as essential for this process. Here, we investigated the function of SEPT11, an interacting partner of SEPT9 whose function is still poorly understood. In uninfected HeLa cells, SEPT11 depletion by siRNA increased cell size but surprisingly did not affect actin filament formation or the colocalization of SEPT9 with actin filaments. SEPT11 depletion increased Listeria invasion, and incubating SEPT11-depleted cells with beads coated with the Listeria surface protein InlB also led to increased entry as compared with control cells. Strikingly, as shown by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, the InlB-mediated stimulation of Met signaling remained intact in SEPT11-depleted cells. Taken together, our results show that SEPT11 is not required for the bacterial entry process and rather restricts its efficacy. Because SEPT2 is essential for the InlB-mediated entry of Listeria, but SEPT11 is not, our findings distinguish the roles of different mammalian septins.

Septins were discovered in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1.Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 69: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) where they organize into a ring at the mother-bud neck during cell division (2.Versele M. Thorner J. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 414-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Septins are GTPases of 30-65 kDa found in most eukaryotes, except plants, sharing an essential role in cytokinesis (3.Kinoshita M. J. Biochem.

Fourteen septins have been identified in humans and classified on the basis of sequence identity into four distinct groups (3.Kinoshita M. J. Biochem.

Septins from different groups polymerize into hetero-oligomeric protein complexes and filaments and may associate with cellular membranes, actin filaments, and microtubules (6.Kinoshita M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7.Spiliotis E.T. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Septins are increasingly regarded as novel cytoskeletal elements (8.Spiliotis E.T. Nelson W.J. Hall P.A. Russell H.S.E. Pringle J.R. The Septins. Wiley-Blackwell, Chippenham2008: 229-246Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but their role in post-mitotic events remains poorly understood. The crystal structure of the SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex recently highlighted that septins, as opposed to actin and microtubules, form non-polar filaments (9.Sirajuddin M. Farkasovsky M. Hauer F. Kuhlmann D. Macara I.G. Weyand M. Stark H. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2007; 449: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In the SEPT7-SEPT6-SEPT2-SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex, SEPT2 has a central role in filament formation (9.Sirajuddin M. Farkasovsky M. Hauer F. Kuhlmann D. Macara I.G. Weyand M. Stark H. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2007; 449: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), whereas SEPT6 is thought to be replaceable with other SEPT6 group members, including SEPT11 (3.Kinoshita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Widely expressed in mammalian tissues (10.Nagata K.-i. Asano T. Nozawa Y. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55895-55904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), SEPT11 may also be a substitute for SEPT6 in other mammalian septin complexes such as SEPT7-SEPT9-SEPT11 (10.Nagata K.-i.

Because other septins homologous to SEPT11 might compensate for its deficiency (12.Ono R. Ihara M. Nakajima H. Ozaki K. Kataoka-Fujiwara Y. Taki T. Nagata K.-i. Inagaki M. Yoshida N. Kitamura T. Hayashi Y. Kinoshita M. Nosaka T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10965-10978Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the degree to which SEPT11 is required for septin filament structure and function is not yet known. Listeria monocytogenes is an invasive bacterium that enters into most mammalian cells in vitro through the interaction of the bacterial surface protein InlB with its host cellular receptor Met, the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (13.Hamon M. Bierne H. Cossart P. Nat. Rev. Micro. 2006; 4: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). We originally identified SEPT9 associated with phagosomes containing latex beads coated with InlB (14.Pizarro-Cerda J. Jonquieres R. Gouin E. Vandekerckhove J. Garin J. Cossart P. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Given the association of septins with the cytoskeleton, and the importance of the cytoskeleton in bacterial invasion, we have started investigating septin function during infection of invasive bacteria in non-phagocytic cells. We have discovered that SEPT9, and its interacting partners SEPT2 and SEPT11, are recruited as 0.6-μm collars next to actin at the site of entry of invasive bacteria (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although functional studies using siRNA 3The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; InlB, internalin B; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; SEPT, septin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. 3The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; InlB, internalin B; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; SEPT, septin; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. have revealed an essential role for SEPT2 in regulating bacterial entry, the role of SEPT11 has not yet been investigated. We thus addressed SEPT11 function in the context of Listeria infection. Mammalian Cells, Bacterial Strains, and Culture Conditions—HeLa human cervix carcinoma cells (ATCC CCL-2) were cultured in DMEM plus GlutaMAX (Amersham Biosciences) supplemented with 1% sodium pyruvate (Amersham Biosciences) and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. L. monocytogenes type strain EGD (BUG 600) was grown overnight at 37 °C in brain heart infusion media (Difco Laboratories), diluted 15× in fresh brain heart infusion, and cultured until A600 nm = 0.8. Gentamicin Survival Assays—Gentamicin survival assays were performed as previously described (16.Pizarro-Cerdá J. Lecuit M. Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Zychlinsky A. Molecular Cellular Microbiology. 31. Academic Press, London2002: 161-177Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated in DMEM with Listeria at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 1 h at 37 °C and 10% CO2, washed with DMEM without antibiotic, and subsequently incubated with fresh gentamicin-containing complete media (10 μg/ml) for an additional 1 h. Cells were washed and then lysed with distilled H2O. The number of viable bacteria released from the cells was assessed by plating on brain heart infusion agar plates. Each experiment was done in triplicate, and triplicates were performed at least three times independently. Survival assays involving drug treatments were performed as described for other Listeria in vitro systems (17.Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18.Kuhn M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 160: 87-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where cells were treated with various concentrations of drugs 30 min prior to infection. Upon infection, host cells were incubated in drugs (at molar concentrations varying from 200 to 0.01 μm) throughout the gentamicin survival assays as detailed above. Final values are expressed as the number of intracellular bacteria per drug treatment relative to DMSO-treated cells. Forchlorfeneuron, cytochalasin D, latrunculin B, nocodazole, and paclitaxel were all suspended in DMSO and handled as suggested by the manufacturer (Sigma). Antibodies and Reagents—Primary antibodies used in this study included rabbit polyclonals anti-SEPT9 (R69) (14.Pizarro-Cerda J. Jonquieres R. Gouin E. Vandekerckhove J. Garin J. Cossart P. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), anti-SEPT11 (gift from Makoto Kinoshita), and anti-SEPT2 (gift from William Trimble). Mouse monoclonal anti-InlB has been described elsewhere (19.Braun L. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin was purchased from Molecular Probes. Mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), used as a control throughout Western blot experimentation, was purchased from AbCam (6C5). Secondary antibodies used were Cy5-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), Alexa 488-conjugated, and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes). F-actin was labeled with Alexa 488-fluorescein isothiocyanate and Alexa 546-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). For immunoblotting, total cellular extracts were blotted with the above-mentioned antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Biosys Laboratories). Proteins were run on 10% acrylamide gels. Preparation of InlB-coated Beads—Coating of latex beads with purified InlB and incubation of host cells with InlB-coated latex beads were performed as previously described (14.Pizarro-Cerda J. Jonquieres R. Gouin E. Vandekerckhove J. Garin J. Cossart P. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20.Braun L. Dramsi S. Dehoux P. Bierne H. Lindahl G. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), where 1-μm diameter latex beads were coated following the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). Prior to addition to siRNA-treated HeLa cells, InlB-coated beads were briefly sonicated, diluted in DMEM, and added to HeLa cells at a multiplicity of ∼100 beads per cell. For kinetic analysis by immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy, host cells were stored at 4 °C for 5 min before incubation with beads, then beads diluted in DMEM were added and cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. Medium was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C and 10% CO2 for 5 min, after which they were washed twice with DMEM and processed for immunofluorescence or scanning electron microscopy analysis. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as previously described (16.Pizarro-Cerdá J. Lecuit M. Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Zychlinsky A. Molecular Cellular Microbiology. 31. Academic Press, London2002: 161-177Google Scholar). Briefly, 105-106 HeLa cells were plated onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates (Techno Plastic Products) and used for experiments 48 h later. Cells on coverslips were fixed 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, then washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and processed for immunofluorescence. After 10 min of incubation in 50 mm ammonium chloride, cells were permeabilized 4 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then incubated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Hybridization of primary and secondary antibodies was performed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Extracellular InlB beads were sometimes labeled prior to permeabilization. Vectashield hard set mounting medium with or without DAPI was applied (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired on a fluorescence inverted microscope Axiovert 200M (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) equipped with a cooled digital charge-coupled device camera (Cool SNAPHQ, Photometrics) driven by Metamorph Imaging System software (Universal Imaging Corp). Confocal images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 (Leica Microsystems). Immunofluorescence and confocal images were visualized and processed using the ImageJ public domain image processing software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). To localize and track changes in septin filament distribution and to segment cells after siRNA treatment, a journal was created using MetaMorph (version 7.1, Universal Imaging). Confocal Z-stack images of siRNA-treated cells were catalogued where images from sets of at least two biological replicates per siRNA treatment were analyzed. Endogenous F-actin and SEPT9 were visualized for immunolabeling with fluorescent phalloidin and anti-SEPT9 antibodies. To define their location, nuclei were marked with DAPI. After deconvolution (Huygens Deconvolution Software; Scientific Volume Imaging), the confocal Z-stack images of cells were segmented, and fibers were localized in each cell. For each segmented cell, quantitative parameters (coordinates and area) were exported to an Excel file. For each segmented fiber, quantitative parameters (coordinates, area, and shape factor) were also exported to an Excel file, where fibers were analyzed per cell, and cells could subsequently be attributed to Class 1, 2, or 3. When comparing the Class frequencies for siRNA treatments, p values were accordingly obtained by chi square test. RNA Interference—HeLa cells (0.8 × 105) were plated in 6-well plates (Techno Plastic Products) and transfected the following day using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Scramble sequence, custom designed from septin sequences ((sense) AUAAGCGACGUCCGCGUGGtt and (antisense) CCACGCGGACGUCGCUUAUtt), was applied as our control throughout experimentation (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Custom scramble sequence, as well as pre-designed siRNAs for SEPT9 (ID#18228) and SEPT11 (ID#125139) were all from Ambion, and handled according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were tested 72 h after siRNA transfection. To measure the efficiency of siRNA knockdown, the relative amounts of SEPT9 and SEPT11 proteins were quantified using GeneTools (SynGene), normalized to give 100% for the controls (average ± S.D. of triplicate experiments). Where mentioned, siRNA sequence for SEPT2 (ID#14709) (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), SEPT6 (ID#136764), and a second siRNA sequence for SEPT11 (ID#125138), was applied. Scanning Electron Microscopy—For scanning electron microscopy analysis, non-infected siRNA-treated HeLa cells, and siRNA-treated HeLa cells incubated with InlB-coated beads, were prepared as described above, subsequently washed in phosphate-buffered saline, prefixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 30 min, and then rinsed in 0.2 m cacodylate buffer. After post-fixation in 1% osmium tetraoxide (in 0.2 m cacodylate buffer), samples were dehydrated in a series of ethanol concentrations. Specimens were critical point-dried using carbon dioxide, and then coated with gold and examined/photographed with a JEOL JSM-6700F scanning electron microscope. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—As previously described by our laboratory (21.Seveau S. Tham T.N. Payrastre B. Hoppe A.D. Swanson J.A. Cossart P. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 790-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), PI3K activation can be measured by the production of its lipid products phosphoinositide 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which recruit the serine/threonine kinase Akt from the cytosol to the membrane, with the Akt pleckstrin homology (PH) domain specifically interacting with phosphoinositide 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate (22.Haugh J.M. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 23.Osaki M. Oshimura M. Ito H. Apoptosis. 2004; 9: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The quantification of FRET between two coexpressed fluorescent chimeras of the Akt PH domain, YFP-AktPH and CFP-AktPH, can be used as readout of PI3K activity. Without stimulation, the fluorescent chimeras are too dispersed in the cytosol to undergo FRET. Upon PI3K activation, the fluorescent AktPH chimeras concentrate at the plasma membrane, consequently leading to an increase in the FRET signal. siRNA-treated HeLa cells were cotransfected using jetPEI (PolyPlus Transfection) according to the manufacturer's instructions with plasmids encoding YFP-AktPH and CFP-AktPH. Details on FRET image acquisition, processing, and statistical analysis were introduced in Mostowy et al. (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were automatically classified as not responsive to InlB stimulation if a maximum slope during FRET, i.e. a peak of signal intensity, could not be detected above background values during InlB stimulation. Final kinetics was obtained for 19 and 11 experiments, representing at least 3 biological replicates for each siRNA treatment, for control and SEPT11 siRNA-treated cells, respectively. To automatically detect whether a cell could be classified as having responded or not to InlB stimulation, we designed our own analysis software carried out using an Excel Macro. Our analysis software is based on these following criteria. From the original kinetic signals (i.e. the mean (EA + ED)/2 over the entire cell), a first median linear filter (formula: yi = (∑i-n/2,i+n/2 yi)/n, n = 3) was applied to smooth artifact arising from the acquisition of original signal. The slope of each filtered curve was subsequently calculated for each time point and was plotted as the processed “FRET response” (i.e. as in Fig. 4B). Starting from T0 (here defined as the time frame immediately following InlB stimulation, frame 16), Tmax was detected when the slope again reached a minimum, where minimum slope is based on a null second derivative function. Tmax-T0 was used to define the duration of FRET response (i.e.“Time of FRET,” where units are frames per 15 s). Between these two time points, the amplitude of the original signal (i.e. the mean (EA + ED)/2 over the entire cell) was calculated as a characteristic to qualify the response (i.e.“Amplitude of FRET”). As a final characteristic, the maximum slope was calculated between T0 and Tmax (i.e.“Maximum slope during FRET”; this value also served to determine if the FRET response of that cell was positive). In the case where Tmax could not be detected based on these criteria, such cells were then classified as not responding to InlB stimulation. SEPT9 and SEPT11 Have Non-overlapping Roles in Filament Organization—We previously found that SEPT9 interacts with septins from other groups to form a complex, and in agreement with other reports (10.Nagata K.-i. Asano T. Nozawa Y. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55895-55904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24.Nobuhiro H. Koh-ichi N. Aie K. Takashi S. Noriko S. Yasuhisa H. Shingo M. Masaki I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) identified SEPT11 as a binding partner of SEPT9 (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In non-dividing, non-infected HeLa cells, both SEPT9 and SEPT11 colocalize with actin filaments, typically in the nuclear region and along the cell periphery, and rarely colocalize with microtubules (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24.Nobuhiro H. Koh-ichi N. Aie K.

Cell. 2002; 13: 3532-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To establish the respective role of SEPT9 and SEPT11 in actin and septin filament formation, we treated HeLa cells, a cell line routinely used for siRNA depletion experiments, with siRNA against SEPT9 or SEPT11. siRNA depletion of each targeted septin protein was assessed following Western blot (Fig. 1A). Knockdown efficiency was quantified as 95 ± 2% for SEPT9 and 80 ± 13% for SEPT11. We then labeled siRNA-treated cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin and anti-SEPT9 antibody (Fig. 1B), and systematically analyzed actin and septin filament remodeling upon septin depletion. Confocal Z-stack images of siRNA-treated cells were then categorized by a septin filament tracking algorithm into three different pre-assigned classes of SEPT9 filament distribution (Fig. 1C): cells presenting filaments around the cell periphery and under the nucleus were designated as Class 1, cells with filaments only around the cell periphery, but not under the nucleus were designated as Class 2, and cells no longer presenting any filaments were designated as Class 3. The frequency of each filament class among septin-depleted cells was then statistically compared with values from control cells (Fig. 1D). As expected, SEPT9 filaments were absent from SEPT9-depleted cells. Actin filaments had also disappeared. In contrast, SEPT9 and actin filaments were not reduced in cells depleted for SEPT11 (p > 0.75), which retained their capacity to present both septin and actin filaments under the nucleus (p > 0.20). These results were also observed using a second siRNA sequence for SEPT11 (p > 0.15 and p > 0.30, respectively) (data not shown). Thus our analysis, in contrast to previously published results for SEPT2, SEPT6, and SEPT7 (26.Kinoshita M. Field C.M. Coughlin M.L. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 27.Kremer B.E. Adang L.A. Macara I.G. Cell. 2007; 130: 837-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), showed that different septin inactivations have different effects on the organization of septin and actin filaments at least in HeLa cells. To further appreciate the impact of depleting different septin subunits, we have assessed the impact of SEPT2, SEPT9, and SEPT11 depletion on septin expression and filament formation (supplemental Fig. S1, A-C). Taken together these data suggest that SEPT11, unlike SEPT2 or SEPT9, is dispensable for septin and actin filament formation. SEPT11 Inactivation Increases Listeria Invasion—Listeria invasion of non-phagocytic cells relies upon the polymerization and depolymerization of actin (13.Hamon M. Bierne H. Cossart P. Nat. Rev. Micro. 2006; 4: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 28.Cossart P. Pizarro-Cerda J. Lecuit M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 23-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) in concert also with the function of SEPT2 (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To assess the functional consequence of SEPT11 depletion on Listeria invasion, we employed the classic gentamicin survival assay (16.Pizarro-Cerdá J. Lecuit M. Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Zychlinsky A. Molecular Cellular Microbiology. 31. Academic Press, London2002: 161-177Google Scholar). In this assay, internalized bacteria are plated and counted 24 h after host cell lysis. Colony counts revealed that SEPT11 siRNA treatment increased Listeria invasion into HeLa cells (p < 0.0005) (Fig. 2), as opposed to results obtained for SEPT2 (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Significantly increased Listeria invasion was also observed using a second siRNA sequence for SEPT11 (p < 0.01) (data not shown). Considering that SEPT2 depletion decreased Listeria entry (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but SEPT11 depletion increased Listeria entry, these data strongly suggest that different septin inactivations can differentially modulate Listeria invasion. SEPT11 Inactivation Increases the Entry of InlB-coated Beads—Latex beads coated with purified recombinant InlB protein have been extensively used to study specifically the InlB-mediated entry of Listeria into HeLa cells (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19.Braun L. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30.Lecuit M. Ohayon H. Braun L. Mengaud J. Cossart P. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5309-5319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Bierne H. Gouin E. Roux P. Caroni P. Yin H.L. Cossart P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To understand why L. monocytogenes invasion is increased upon SEPT11 depletion, we investigated particle uptake using 1-μm InlB-coated latex beads. siRNA-treated cells were incubated with InlB beads and were examined by a double immunofluorescence microscopy technique to distinguish intra-versus extracellular beads and provide a measure of InlB-induced phagocytosis (Fig. 3A). At 5-min postincubation, SEPT11-depleted cells presented an increased capacity to internalize beads compared with control cells (p < 0.05). On average, control cells internalized 6 beads per cell, whereas SEPT11-depleted cells internalized 24 beads per cell (p < 0.001). Scanning electron microscopy was also used to examine the uptake of InlB beads (Fig. 3B). Of note, the membrane surface of SEPT11-depleted cells presented smoother membrane with a heterogeneous distribution of microvilli-like structures compared with control cells (supplemental Fig. S2A). At 5-min postincubation, the majority of beads were already internalized for control and SEPT11-depleted cells, but in agreement with the above immunofluorescence experiments, the number of internalized InlB beads per SEPT11-depleted cell was significantly higher than in control cells. As previously reported for SEPT2-, SEPT6-, and SEPT7-depleted cells (26.Kinoshita M. Field C.M. Coughlin M.L. Straight A.F. Mitchison T.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 27.Kremer B.E. Adang L.A. Macara I.G. Cell. 2007; 130: 837-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we found that HeLa cells become large and flat upon SEPT11 depletion (Fig. 1B). As a result, differences in the number of internalized InlB beads per siRNA-treated cell could reflect changes in cell size. To evaluate this, we measured the surface area of non-infected siRNA-treated HeLa cells after fixation (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S2B). On average, the surface area for SEPT11-depleted cells was almost twice as large as control cells (p < 0.05). By comparison, SEPT2-depleted cells (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) occupied approximately the same surface area as control cells (p > 0.73) (data not shown). Thus, InlB invasion differences in SEPT11-depleted cells can in part be explained by differences in surface area. Taken together, these results definitively establish that SEPT11-depleted HeLa cells are competent to internalize Listeria and 1-μm InlB beads. Signaling Events in Response to Met Stimulation by InlB Are Not Affected by the Depletion of SEPT11—Listeria enter HeLa cells via interactions between the cell surface receptor Met and the bacterial ligand InlB (32.Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Given the positive impact of SEPT11 depletion on particle entry, we hypothesized that signaling events induced upon InlB-Met interaction could be increased upon SEPT11 depletion. To test this, we used a FRET-based approach previously developed in our laboratory that focuses on phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation, a signaling pathway induced upon InlB-Met interaction (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21.Seveau S. Tham T.N. Payrastre B. Hoppe A.D. Swanson J.A. Cossart P. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 790-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The FRET assay is based on the fact that 3′-phosphoinositides produced by PI3K upon InlB-induced Met activation recruit the serine/threonine kinase Akt from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Previous work with this assay revealed that SEPT2 has a critical role in these signaling events (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). SEPT11-depleted cells and control cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding YFP-AktPH and CFP-AktPH. The FRET stoichiometry measurement between YFP-AktPH and CFP-AktPH was then performed to determine FRET efficiency (Fig. 4, A and B, and supplemental movies S1A and S1B). As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, cells depleted of SEPT11 responded to InlB stimulation as well as control cells. Thus SEPT11, in contrast to SEPT2 (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), does not have an essential role in early signaling events in response to Met stimulation by InlB. Septins are GTP-binding proteins that form filaments and are increasingly recognized as cytoskeleton components (5.Weirich C.S. Erzberger J.P. Barral Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 478-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 7.Spiliotis E.T. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although several studies have reported on septin function, little information is available for SEPT11. Using siRNA, we addressed the possible requirement for SEPT11 during Listeria infection. Our results show that SEPT11 is dispensable for InlB-mediated invasion, and surprisingly, its absence even leads to an increase in invasion. A Dispensable Role for SEPT11 in Septin Filament Formation—SEPT11 can bind SEPT9 in vitro (10.Nagata K.-i. Asano T. Nozawa Y. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55895-55904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24.Nobuhiro H. Koh-ichi N. Aie K. Takashi S. Noriko S. Yasuhisa H. Shingo M. Masaki I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, SEPT9 depletion prevents septin filament formation and also actin filament formation. In contrast, SEPT11 depletion did not alter the presence and colocalization of SEPT9 and actin filaments (Fig. 1, B-D). That SEPT9, but not SEPT11, is required for septin filament formation strongly suggests non-overlapping functions for these different septins. Of note, neither SEPT9 nor SEPT11 depletion had any noticeable effect on microtubules (supplemental Fig. S3). Septins Differentially Control the InlB-Met-mediated Entry of Listeria into Host Cells—To investigate how SEPT11 can regulate the internalization process, we performed our functional analysis on HeLa cells, because they allow the specific analysis of the InlB-Met entry pathway used by Listeria (28.Cossart P. Pizarro-Cerda J. Lecuit M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 23-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Our present study together with previous work (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reveals that septins differentially modulate the InlB-Met-mediated entry of L. monocytogenes, with an increase in SEPT11-depleted cells and a decrease in SEPT2-depleted cells. Moreover, FRET analysis confirmed that SEPT11, unlike SEPT2, is not required for the appropriate signaling cascade in response to Met stimulation by InlB. These data reveal a different effect of SEPT11 and SEPT2 depletion on the interaction of InlB with its host receptor Met, and consequently on bacterial entry. How can one explain these results? Septin filaments colocalize in HeLa cells (data not shown), however we cannot exclude different localization between SEPT2 and SEPT11 at this stage. Using siRNA, we observe that SEPT11 filament formation relies on SEPT2 expression, but SEPT2 filaments continue to form in the absence of SEPT11 (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Structural data have shown that septins are ordered in the isolated complex as SEPT7-SEPT6-SEPT2-SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 (9.Sirajuddin M. Farkasovsky M. Hauer F. Kuhlmann D. Macara I.G. Weyand M. Stark H. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2007; 449: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). As the central subunit in this septin complex, SEPT2 cannot be replaced in the conditions tested (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Conversely, it has been proposed that members of the SEPT6 group are interchangeable, at least in the context of the SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex (3.Kinoshita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 12.Ono R. Ihara M. Nakajima H. Ozaki K. Kataoka-Fujiwara Y. Taki T. Nagata K.-i. Inagaki M. Yoshida N. Kitamura T. Hayashi Y. Kinoshita M. Nosaka T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10965-10978Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, some of the phenotypes we observe here in cells depleted for SEPT11 could be because the SEPT6 group members are partially redundant. Nevertheless, cells depleted for SEPT11 do not present all the control cell phenotypes. In particular they have an increased cell size and are more permissive to InlB-mediated invasion, suggesting that other SEPT6 group members cannot fully substitute for SEPT11. The extent to which SEPT6 group members share properties and/or functionally compete with each other is difficult to currently appreciate. Why Are SEPT11-depleted Cells More Permissive to Listeria Invasion?—To explain differences in L. monocytogenes infection arising from the SEPT11 siRNA treatment, we analyzed phenotypes previously reported for septin-depleted cells. Of these, arrest in cytokinesis is a classic phenotype of septin depletion (1.Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 69: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), itself typically assessed in mammalian cells by the increase of binucleated cells (25.Surka M.C. Tsang C.W. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3532-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 33.Spiliotis E.T. Kinoshita M. Nelson W.J.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1719-1725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, SEPT11 depletion resulted in an increase of binucleated cells (supplemental Fig. S4A). To determine if binucleation was influencing Listeria infection, we fixed and fluorescently labeled cells after gentamicin treatment to determine the frequency of infected cells that were binucleated. However, binucleated cells were as susceptible to infection as cells with a single nucleus (supplemental Fig. S4B). The SEPT11 phenotype described here is different from the effects of global cytoskeleton disruption on bacterial entry. As well established (17.Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18.Kuhn M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 160: 87-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of actin even by low concentrations of cytochalasin D or latrunculin B was found to have potent negative effects on bacterial invasion of HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S5A). Depolymerization of microtubules by nocodazole, or stabilization of microtubules with paclitaxel, also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of invading Listeria (18.Kuhn M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 160: 87-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S5B). We finally tested the impact of a novel drug, forchlorfeneuron, to specifically investigate septin function (29.Hu Q. Nelson W.J. Spiliotis E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29563-29571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Forchlorfeneuron treatment also had a negative impact on bacterial invasion (supplemental Fig. S5, C and D). As SEPT11 depletion increases entry, our study highlights a novel type of control for a cytoskeleton component. As shown in Fig. 3C, SEPT11-depleted cells are larger than control cells, which in part may explain the higher permissivity. Nevertheless, the fact that SEPT11-depleted cells are more permissive suggests a role for SEPT11 in limiting entry into cells. Quite strikingly, preliminary work has revealed that SEPT6-depleted HeLa cells also are increased for Listeria invasion (p = 0.001) (supplemental Fig. S5E). These results strongly support that all SEPT6 group members play a similar role in restricting entry. Whether this is due to septin association with the plasma membrane or septin function in regulating cytoskeleton dynamics is currently under investigation. On the basis of different recruitment we have previously distinguished septin from actin function during bacterial entry and identified SEPT2 as essential for bacterial entry (15.Mostowy S. Nam Tham T. Danckaert A. Guadagnini S.P. Boisson-Dupuis S.P. Pizarro-Cerdá J. Cossart P. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that SEPT11 depletion does not decrease, but surprisingly increases, the InlB-mediated entry of Listeria. Taken together, these data highlight the specific roles for two different septins, SEPT2 and SEPT11, during the InlB-mediated internalization process. These findings for the first time distinguish unique septin roles in regulating the efficiency of receptor-mediated bacterial invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1983316713,"The crystal structure of nucleotide-free yeast F(1) ATPase has been determined at a resolution of 3.6 A. The overall structure is very similar to that of the ground state enzyme. In particular, the beta(DP) and beta(TP) subunits both adopt the closed conformation found in the ground state structure despite the absence of bound nucleotides. This implies that interactions between the gamma and beta subunits are as important as nucleotide occupancy in determining the conformational state of the beta subunits. Furthermore, this result suggests that for the mitochondrial enzyme, there is no state of nucleotide occupancy that would result in more than one of the beta subunits adopting the open conformation. The adenine-binding pocket of the beta(TP) subunit is disrupted in the apoenzyme, suggesting that the beta(DP) subunit is responsible for unisite catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2083761293,"There is recent evidence that galectin-3 participates in immunity to infections, mostly by tuning cytokine production. We studied the balance of Th1/Th2 responses to P. brasiliensis experimental infection in the absence of galectin-3. The intermediate resistance to the fungal infection presented by C57BL/6 mice, associated with the development of a mixed type of immunity, was replaced with susceptibility to infection and a Th2-polarized immune response, in galectin-3-deficient (gal3−/−) mice. Such a response was associated with defective inflammatory and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions, high IL-4 and GATA-3 expression and low nitric oxide production in the organs of infected animals. Gal3−/− macrophages exhibited higher TLR2 transcript levels and IL-10 production compared to wild-type macrophages after stimulation with P. brasiliensis antigens. We hypothesize that, during an in vivo P. brasiliensis infection, galectin-3 exerts its tuning role on immunity by interfering with the generation of regulatory macrophages, thus hindering the consequent Th2-polarized type of response."
https://openalex.org/W2029855707,"The extent to which the BH3-only protein Bid is important for intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) apoptotic cell death induced by genotoxic stress remains controversial. In the present study, we examine this issue using a panel of gene-manipulated Bax-deficient Jurkat T-lymphocytes. Cells stably depleted of Bid were far less sensitive than control-transfected cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis. In particular, drug-induced Bak activation, cytochrome c release, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase activation were all decreased in cells lacking Bid. Reconstitution experiments using recombinant proteins and permeabilized Bid-deficient cells demonstrated that truncated Bid (tBid), but not full-length Bid, potently induced Bak activation and the release of cytochrome c. Further, caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells efficiently cleaved Bid and were sensitive to drug-induced apoptosis. By comparison, Apaf-1-deficient cells, as well as cells overexpressing full-length X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) or the BIR1/BIR2 domains of XIAP, failed to cleave Bid in response to genotoxic stress. These data suggest that tBid plays an important regulatory role in the execution of DNA damage-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis. However, the fact that cleavage of Bid to tBid is mediated by executioner caspases suggests that a self-amplifying feed forward loop involving caspases, Bid, and mitochondria may help determine irreversible commitment to apoptosis.

Apoptosis is an active form of cell death that plays an essential role during normal embryonic development and in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in the adult organism (1.Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar). Consequently, dysregulation of apoptosis has been implicated as a contributing factor to the onset of different pathological conditions, including cancer. In addition, it is now generally accepted that many genotoxic anticancer drugs are effective against tumor cells for their ability to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (2.Lowe S.W. Lin A.W. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations or the altered expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins can contribute to the development of drug resistance. Execution of apoptosis is mediated by a family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases (caspases). During true mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are the primary regulators of caspase activation for their role in controlling mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) 2The abbreviations used are: MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; Smac, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase; Apaf-1, apoptotic protease activating factor-1; BH3, Bcl-2 homology 3; tBid, truncated Bid; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; ΔΨ, mitochondrial membrane potential; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; BIR, baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; qVD-OPh, quinoline-Val-Asp-CH2-difluorophenoxy; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. (3.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). The process of MOMP results in the release of cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac, also known as DIABLO), and Omi (also known as HtrA2) into the cytosol where they converge to promote the activation of caspase-9 within the apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) apoptosome complex. The Bcl-2 family contains proteins with opposing functions, and it is generally thought that the induction of MOMP requires the activation of either Bak or Bax triggered by a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only protein (4.Chipuk J.E. Bouchier-Hayes L. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 5.Ow Y.L. Green D.R. Hao Z. Mak T.W. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Indeed, evidence in the literature indicates that cells lacking either Bak or Bax exhibit only subtle defects in MOMP, whereas doubly deficient cells are often found to be highly resistant to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (7.Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P. Frauwirth K. Chen Y. Wei M. Eng V.M. Adelman D.M. Simon M.C. Ma A. Golden J.A. Evan G. Korsmeyer S.J.

Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar). At present, there are two models for the activation of Bax or Bak by BH3-only proteins. One model argues that BH3-only proteins function as either “sensitizer” (e.g. Bad and Noxa) or “activator” proteins (e.g. truncated Bid (tBid), Bim, and perhaps Puma) (9.Kim H. Rafiuddin-Shah M. Tu H.C. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In this scenario, a sensitizer protein is needed to displace an activator protein from a prosurvival protein (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1) to activate Bak or Bax. The second model argues that BH3-only proteins bind and inhibit the function of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, which normally bind to and inhibit Bak and Bax (10.Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J.

Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar), Bid is unique in that it requires post-translational modification for activation, most notably involving caspase-8-mediated cleavage to tBid (12.Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 13.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar). Bid normally resides in the cytosol and possibly the nucleus (15.Zinkel S.S. Hurov K.E. Ong C. Abtahi F.M. Gross A. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Upon being cleaved, the C-terminal fragment (tBid) is myristoylated at its newly exposed N terminus, translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and/or activates Bak or Bax protein (16.Zha J. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the N-terminal cleavage fragment of Bid is quickly ubiquitinated for degradation and that this degradation is necessary for the pro-apoptotic function of tBid (17.Tait S.W. de Vries E. Maas C. Keller A.M. D'Santos C.S. Borst J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1453-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The same study also concluded that, although full-length Bid is capable of translocating to the OMM, it is not able to induce MOMP on its own (17.Tait S.W. de Vries E. Maas C. Keller A.M. D'Santos C.S. Borst J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1453-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A well characterized example of tBid involvement during apoptosis is in the engagement of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in so-called type II cells upon activation of the extrinsic pathway (18.Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated whether Bid plays a functional role in the induction of MOMP during apoptosis in response to the genotoxic anticancer drug etoposide. To that end, we used Bax-deficient Jurkat cells that are stably depleted of Bid and evaluated the extent to which these cells underwent drug-induced MOMP. In addition, Jurkat clones in which the intrinsic pathway had been inhibited due to the stable knockdown of Apaf-1 or the overexpression of full-length XIAP or the baculoviral IAP repeats 1 and 2 (BIR1/BIR2) of XIAP were used to gain insight into the molecular requirements necessary for cleavage of Bid to tBid during drug-induced apoptosis. Strikingly, the data showed that etoposide-induced apoptosis was decreased in Bid-deficient Jurkat cells. In particular, cells lacking Bid expression exhibited decreased Bak activation, cytochrome c release, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), and caspase activation. Further, incubation of permeabilized Bid-deficient cells with recombinant tBid, but not full-length Bid, induced Bak dimerization and cytochrome c release. Significantly, we also found that cleavage of Bid to tBid occurred strictly downstream of Apaf-1 by a mechanism that required active executioner caspases. Cell Culture—Wild-type (clones E6.1 and A3) and caspase-8-deficient (clone I 9.2) Jurkat T-lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2% (w/v) glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transfected cells, 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) was substituted for penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were maintained in an exponential growth phase for all experiments. All cells were re-plated in fresh complete nonselective medium prior to apoptosis induction. Apoptosis was induced with etoposide (10 μm, Sigma-Aldrich) or agonistic anti-Fas antibody (100 ng/ml, clone CH-11, MBL International, Woburn, MA). The caspase inhibitor quinoline-Val-Asp-CH2-difluorophenoxy (qVD-OPh, MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) was used at a final concentration of 20 μm. Measurement of Caspase Activity—Cells (5 × 105) were pelleted and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were resuspended in 25 μl of PBS, added to a microtiter plate, and combined with DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) dissolved in a standard reaction buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.25, 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS). Cleavage of DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin was monitored by aminomethylcoumarin production in an FLx800 Multi-detection Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT) using 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission wavelengths. RNA Interference—The vector-based pSUPER RNAi system (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) was used to suppress BID gene (RefSeq accession number NM_001196) expression. The gene-specific targeting insert specifies a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotides 35–53 (5′-GGGATGAGTGCATCACAAA-3′) downstream of the transcription start site, which is separated by a 9-nucleotide non-complementary spacer (TTCAAGAGA) from the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. The sequence was ligated into the BglII and XhoI sites of the pSUPER.neo vector, which was subsequently transformed into TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Several clones were obtained, and the correct insert was verified by sequence analysis. Transfections—Wild-type Jurkat T-lymphocytes (107) were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA (pSUPER-neo, pSUPER-Apaf-1, pSUPER-Bid, pcDNA3-XIAP, pcDNA3-XIAP-BIR1/BIR2, or pcDNA3-neo) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell system (0.4-cm cuvette, 300 V, and 950 microfarads). Cells were allowed to recover in RPMI 1640 complete growth medium for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Selection of transfected cells was performed in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin for several weeks, at which time serial dilutions were performed to obtain single-cell clones of Bid-silenced cells, Apaf-1-silenced cells, and cells overexpressing full-length XIAP or the BIR1/BIR2 domains of XIAP. Flow Cytometry for Cell Death and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨ) Measurements—Phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane was detected using the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Apoptosis Detection Kit II (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 106 cells were pelleted following etoposide or anti-Fas treatment and washed in PBS. Next, the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. Prior to flow cytometric analysis, 400 μl of binding buffer was added to the cells. For ΔΨ determination, the MitoProbe DiIC1(5) Kit (Invitrogen and Molecular Probes) was used. Briefly, cells (106) were pelleted following drug treatment, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of warm PBS. Next, 5 μl of 10 μm DiIC1(5) were added to the cells, and the mixture was incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Western Blotting—Pelleted cells (5 × 106) were resuspended and lysed in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-Free, Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and equal amounts were mixed with Laemmli. Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (19.Robertson J.D. Enoksson M. Suomela M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29803-29809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were rabbit anti-Bak, NT (Millipore), rabbit anti-Bax (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), mouse anti-β-actin (clone AC-15, Sigma), rabbit anti-Bid (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-caspase-3 (clone 8G10, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-caspase-7 (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-caspase-8 (clone 1C12, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), and rabbit anti-GAPDH (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Subcellular Fractionation—Following treatment with etoposide, cells (106) were washed in PBS, resuspended in 50 μl of buffer (140 mm mannitol, 46 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini-EDTA Free) and permeabilized with 3 μg of digitonin (Sigma) on ice for 10 min. Plasma membrane permeabilization was monitored by trypan blue staining, and cell suspensions were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis. Digitonin-permeabilized Cells—Jurkat cells (2.5 × 106) were washed in PBS, resuspended in 125 μl of buffer (140 mm mannitol, 46 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm succinate, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini-EDTA Free). Purified recombinant, truncated or full-length, Bid protein (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added at a final concentration ranging from 5 nm to 250 nm. The cells were then permeabilized with 7.5 μg of digitonin (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature (22 °C) for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis. Determination of Bak Oligomerization and Activation—For detection of Bak oligomerization, cells (106) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 80 μl of 100 mm EDTA/PBS, incubated with the cross-linking agent bismaleimidohexane (1 mm) for 30 min at room temperature (22 °C), quenched with 100 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min, pelleted, and processed for Western blotting. For detection of activated Bak by flow cytometry, cells (106) were washed in PBS and fixed in 400 μl of 0.25% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, subsequently washed two times with 1% fetal bovine serum in PBS, and incubated in 50 μl of staining buffer (1% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml digitonin in PBS) with a conformation-specific mouse monoclonal antibody against Bak (1:30, AM03, Cal-biochem) for 30 min at room temperature (22 °C). Then, cells were washed and resuspended in 50 μl of staining buffer containing 0.25 μg of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled chicken anti-mouse for 30 min in the dark. Cells were washed again and analyzed by flow cytometry. Analysis and histogram overlays were performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Bid Is Cleaved in Response to the DNA-damaging Chemotherapeutic Agent Etoposide—Although it has been reported that overexpression of full-length Bid causes cell death (12.Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) and that full-length Bid can translocate to the OMM in response to an apoptotic stimulus (20.Sarig R. Zaltsman Y.

Chem. 2004; 279: 32848-32857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), it is generally accepted that tBid is far more potent than full-length Bid at activating Bak or Bax to induce MOMP (13.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar, 14.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for cleavage of Bid to tBid is at least partially understood. Caspase-8-mediated proteolysis of Bid to tBid during receptor-mediated cell killing in type II cells is probably the best characterized example of the involvement of Bid during apoptotic cell death (13.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar, 14.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar). It is also known that cathepsins, calpains, and Granzyme B can cleave Bid, although in most instances the cleavage sites are different from those targeted by caspase-8 (23.Yin X.M. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 369: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that caspase-3, and possibly caspase-2, can cleave Bid in vitro, although other evidence indicates that Bid is a relatively poor substrate for caspase-2 (24.Bonzon C. Bouchier-Hayes L. Pagliari L.J. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2150-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25.Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the mechanism responsible for the cleavage of Bid, it is the C-terminal fragment that promotes apoptosis. Further, caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid to tBid exposes a glycine residue at the newly formed N terminus that, in turn, undergoes myristoylation to facilitate translocation of tBid to mitochondria where it promotes MOMP induction (16.Zha J. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Although tBid is a potent inducer of Bak/Bax-controlled MOMP during receptor-mediated cell killing, whether tBid is an important upstream regulator of MOMP during true intrinsic apoptotic cell death is controversial (15.Zinkel S.S. Hurov K.E. Ong C. Abtahi F.M. Gross A. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2005; 122: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26.Kaufmann T. Tai L. Ekert P.G. Huang D.C.

Gross A. Cell. 2007; 130 (author reply 10–11): 9-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, we set out to determine the extent to which Bid or tBid is functionally important for MOMP induction and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, Western blot analysis of Jurkat whole-cell lysates obtained at 6 h following incubation with etoposide (10 μm) revealed that Bid had been cleaved to tBid. Drug-induced cleavage of Bid to tBid was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis (28%) as determined by annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide co-staining (Fig. 1B). Further, in agreement with our previous findings, incubation of cells with 10 μm etoposide for 6 h resulted in the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-9, -3, and -7, and a concomitant increase in caspase (DEVDase) activity (Fig. 1, C and D). Stable Knockdown of Bid Desensitizes Jurkat Cells to Genotoxic Drug-induced Apoptosis—Having shown that tBid is generated in wild-type Jurkat cells undergoing DNA damage-induced apoptosis, we next used a vector-based system that directs the synthesis of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to produce stable silencing of Bid. We hypothesized that such cells would shed light on whether Bid was important for genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis or if cleavage of Bid to tBid (Fig. 1A) was largely a bystander event in this setting with little biological significance. Two single-cell Bid-deficient Jurkat clones (#7 and #13) were used for these studies, and the extent to which Bid was suppressed was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). As mentioned previously, the requirement for Bid cleavage to tBid upon activation of the extrinsic pathway in type II cells has been well characterized and is widely accepted (13.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar, 14.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar, 29.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). Because Jurkat cells are considered to be of type II origin, we first tested the sensitivity of these cells to apoptosis induced by agonistic anti-Fas antibody (100 ng/ml). As anticipated, Bid-deficient cells were highly resistant to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis with clone #13 exhibiting the greatest degree of resistance as assessed by annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide co-staining (Fig. 2B) and proteolytic processing of caspases (Fig. 2C, lanes 6 and 9 versus 3). Next, having demonstrated that Bid was strictly required for receptor-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells, we incubated the cells for 6 h in the presence of etoposide (10 μm) and evaluated the different clones for their sensitivity to apoptosis induction. The results indicated that both Bid-deficient clones were less sensitive than control-transfected cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis with the degree of resistance paralleling the extent to which Bid expression had been suppressed (Fig. 2B). In agreement with these findings, Western blot analysis of cell lysates obtained at 6 h post-etoposide treatment showed that proteolytic processing of caspase-9, -3, and -7 was decreased in Bid-deficient cells (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 8 versus 2). Overall, these data suggest that Bid plays an important function during genotoxic drug-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. DNA Damage-induced Mitochondrial Events Are Attenuated in Bid-deficient Jurkat Cells—Studies from numerous laboratories have shown that MOMP is tightly regulated by pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family (6.Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). In particular, MOMP is widely accepted to require the activation of a multidomain protein, notably Bak or Bax. The presence and activation of either Bak or Bax is thought to be sufficient to induce MOMP. In fact, because the deletion of either gene alone produces only subtle defects in apoptosis, whereas doubly-deficient cells exhibit severe apoptosis deficiencies (7.Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P. Frauwirth K. Chen Y. Wei M. Eng V.M. Adelman D.M. Simon M.C. Ma A. Golden J.A. Evan G. Korsmeyer S.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), Bak and Bax are generally thought to be redundant in function. The activation of Bak and Bax coincides with their homo-oligomerization and in most instances is thought to depend on the presence and prior activation of a BH3-only Bcl-2 family member. However, the mechanism by which BH3-only proteins activate Bak or Bax is controversial (30.Chipuk J.E. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 157-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). As mentioned previously, one model suggests that BH3-only proteins activate Bak and Bax directly, whereas the second model indicates BH3-only proteins activate Bak and Bax indirectly by neutralizing the anti-apoptotic function of pro-survival Bcl-2 family proteins. Because we had observed that etoposide-induced apoptosis was decreased in Bid-deficient Jurkat cells, we next evaluated mitochondrial events that characteristically define MOMP, such as the dimerization and activation of Bak or Bax, the release of intermembrane space proteins, and the loss of ΔΨ. In a recent paper, we showed that Jurkat (E6.1) cells express Bak, but not Bax, protein (31.Shawgo M.E. Shelton S.N. Robertson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35532-35538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Those findings were confirmed in Fig. 3A, and we also determined that silencing Bid had no effect on the expression level of Bak protein (lane 4 versus 3 and 2). Therefore, we next examined the extent to which Bak had undergone oligomerization in response to etoposide, using the cross-linking agent bismaleimidohexane. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, cross-linked complexes consistent with Bak dimers were detected in control-transfected cells following treatment with 10 μm etoposide, whereas the extent of drug-induced dimerization was markedly decreased in the Bid-deficient cells as illustrated in lane 4 of Fig. 3B. These findings were in line with results obtained using an active conformation-specific monoclonal Bak antibody and flow cytometric analysis where activation causes a shift to the right of the resulting histogram (Fig. 3C). Next, consistent with the inhibition of Bak activation in cells lacking Bid, the release of cytochrome c in response to etoposide was also markedly inhibited (Fig. 3D). Finally, as illustrated in Fig. 3E, the loss of ΔΨ in response to etoposide was also decreased in the Bid-deficient cell line (Fig. 3E). Combined, these data strongly suggest that Bid functions to promote Bak-controlled MOMP during DNA damage-induced apoptosis in J"
https://openalex.org/W1985835921,"Rx is a paired-like homeobox gene that is required for vertebrate eye formation. Mice lacking Rx function do not develop eyes or the posterior pituitary. To determine whether Rx is required cell autonomously in these tissues, we generated embryonic chimeras consisting of wild type and Rx−/− cells. We found that in the eye, Rx-deficient cells cannot participate in the formation of the neuroretina, retina pigment epithelium and the distal part of the optic stalk. In addition, in the ventral forebrain, Rx function is required cell autonomously for the formation of the posterior pituitary. Interestingly, Rx−/− and wild type cells segregate before the morphogenesis of these two tissues begins. Our observations suggest that Rx function is not only required for the morphogenesis of the retina and posterior pituitary, but also prior to morphogenesis, for the sorting out of cells to form distinct fields of retinal/pituitary cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050226772,"Given the recent changes in climate, there is an urgent need to understand the evolutionary ability of populations to respond to these changes.We performed individual-based simulations with different shapes of the fitness curve, different heritabilities, different levels of density compensation, and different autocorrelation of environmental noise imposed on an environmental trend to study the ability of a population to adapt to changing conditions. The main finding is that when there is a positive autocorrelation of environmental noise, the outcome of the evolutionary process is much more unpredictable compared to when the noise has no autocorrelation. In addition, we found that strong selection resulted in a higher load, and more extinctions, and that this was most pronounced when heritability was low. The level of density-compensation was important in determining the variance in load when there was strong selection, and when genetic variance was lower when the level of density-compensation was low.The strong effect of the details of the environmental fluctuations makes predictions concerning the evolutionary future of populations very hard to make. In addition, to be able to make good predictions we need information on heritability, fitness functions and levels of density compensation. The results strongly suggest that patterns of environmental noise must be incorporated in future models of environmental change, such as global warming."
https://openalex.org/W1995804627,"Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Despite intensive clinical investigation and many novel therapeutic approaches, average survival for the patients with malignant gliomas is only about 1 year. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has shown potent and cancer-selective killing activity and drawn considerable attention as a promising therapy for cancers, but concerns over delivery and toxicity have limited progress. We have developed a secretable trimeric TRAIL (stTRAIL) and here evaluated the therapeutic potential of this stTRAIL-based gene therapy in brain tumors. An adenovirus (Ad-stTRAIL) delivering stTRAIL was injected into intra-cranial human glioma tumors established in nude mice and tumor growth monitored using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ad-stTRAIL gene therapy showed potent tumor suppressor activity with no toxic side effects at therapeutically effective doses. When compared with 1, 3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), a conventional therapy for malignant gliomas, Ad-stTRAIL suppressed tumor growth more potently. The combination of Ad-stTRAIL and BCNU significantly increased survival compared to the control mice or mice receiving Ad-stTRAIL alone. Our data indicate that Ad-stTRAIL, either alone or combined with BCNU, has promise as a novel therapy for malignant gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2090714825,"Clinical deterioration on drug therapy for tuberculosis is a common cause of hospital admission in Africa. Potential causes for clinical deterioration in settings of high HIV-1 prevalence include drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), co-morbid illnesses, poor adherence to therapy, tuberculosis associated-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) and subtherapeutic antitubercular drug levels. It is important to derive a rapid diagnostic work-up to determine the cause of clinical deterioration as well as specific management to prevent further clinical deterioration and death. We undertook this study among tuberculosis (TB) patients referred to an adult district level hospital situated in a high HIV-1 prevalence setting to determine the frequency, reasons and outcome for such clinical deterioration.A prospective observational study conducted during the first quarter of 2007. We defined clinical deterioration as clinical worsening or failure to stabilise after 14 or more days of antitubercular treatment, resulting in hospital referral. We collected data on tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment, HIV-1 status and antiretroviral treatment, and investigated reasons for clinical deterioration as well as outcome.During this period, 352 TB patients met inclusion criteria; 296 were admitted to hospital accounting for 17% of total medical admissions (n = 1755). Eighty three percent of TB patients (291/352) were known to be HIV-1 co-infected with a median CD4 count of 89cells/mm(3) (IQR 38-157). Mortality among TB patients admitted to hospital was 16% (n = 48). The median duration of hospital admission was 9.5 days (IQR 4-18), longer than routine in this setting (4 days). Among patients in whom HIV-1 status was known (n = 324), 72% of TB patients (n = 232) had an additional illness to tuberculosis; new AIDS defining illnesses (n = 80) were the most frequent additional illnesses (n = 208) in HIV-1 co-infected patients (n = 291). Rifampin-resistant M.tb (n = 41), TB-IRIS (n = 51) and drug resistant bacterial infections (n = 12) were found in 12%, 14% and 3.4% of the 352 cases, respectively.In our setting, new AIDS defining illnesses, drug resistant M.tb and other drug resistant bacteria are important reasons for clinical deterioration in HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving antitubercular treatment. HIV-1 co-infected patients may be at increased risk of acquiring nosocomial drug resistant pathogens because profound immune suppression results in co-morbid illnesses that require prolonged inpatient admissions. Routine infection control is essential and needs to be strengthened in our setting."

Exposing IgG to low pH conditions induces conformational changes, leading to its functional damage or loss, although the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study using random peptide T7 phage display libraries, we isolated a unique and novel peptide motif that specifically recognized the non-native conformer (acid conformer) of human IgG that was generated by the low pH treatment, but not the native conformer. We examined the generation conditions and biochemical properties of acid conformer using the peptide motif as an affinity ligand. The acid conformer was easily generated at acidic pH (<pH 3.0) and at moderate temperatures (20-40 °C). The conformer was present in a monomeric form functionally maintaining antigen or Fc receptor binding, but showed a tendency to aggregate with a long incubation time at neutral pH (>25 °C). The peptides isolated here could contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms of antibody dysfunction or aggregation during acid exposure as well as storage of human IgG.

The peptides isolated here could contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms of antibody dysfunction or aggregation during acid exposure as well as storage of human IgG. Protein A is widely used as an affinity ligand for the purification of human antibodies because it specifically binds to the Fc region of IgG (1Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkin C.R. Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). However, we must consider possible contamination with bacterial endotoxin and Protein A itself in purified antibody preparations for clinical use, because Protein A is derived from bacteria and possesses high anti-genicity (2Food and Drug Administration Control of Microbiological Contamination, Code of Federal Regulations 21, 211.113. U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.2003Google Scholar). Therefore, many investigators have attempted to construct purification systems as alternatives to the Protein A column. By investigating low molecular weight compounds, Li et al. made Protein A mimetics and performed IgG purification from human plasma and murine ascites fluid (3Li R. Dowd V. Stewart D.J. Burton S.J. Lowe C.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Fassina et al. used peptide derivatives as affinity ligands, which have broader specificity to IgG than Protein A, and applied them to antibody affinity chromatography (4Fassina G. Verdoliva A. Palombo G. Ruvo M. Cassani G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1998; 11: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Ehrlish and Bailon, and Krook et al. also reported IgG-binding peptides discovered using the filamentous phage display technique (5Ehrlich G.K. Bailon P. J. Mol. Recognit. 1998; 11: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Krook M. Mosbach K. Ramstrom O. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 221: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, Verdoliva et al. screened a synthetic peptide library and identified an IgG-binding cyclic dimeric peptide that recognized the lower hinge region of IgG (7Verdoliva A. Marasco D.

Punzo C. Rivieccio V. Verdoliva A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 333: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Of these earlier attempts, the Fc-III peptide with an intramolecular disulfide bond reported by DeLano et al. in 2000 (9DeLano W.L. Ultsch M.H. de Vos A.M. Wells J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) is a potential candidate that can displace Protein A functions. This is because the Fc-III peptide binds with relatively high affinity (the apparent dissociation constant Kd is 30 nm) to the groove between the CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgG and shares common binding sites with Protein A. In addition, the Fc-III peptide has been used in studies of affinity enhancement (10Dias R.L. Fasan R. Moehle K. Renard A. Obrecht D. Robinson J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 2726-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and artificial cell-surface antibody receptors (11Boonyarattanakalin S. Martin S.E. Sun Q. Peterson B.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 11463-11470Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Krumpe et al. recently reported the construction of a random peptide library on a T7 phage display system (12Krumpe L.R. Atkinson A.J. Smythers G.W. Kandel A. Schumacher K.M. McMahon J.B. Makowski L. Mori T. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 4210-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The library has marked characteristics including reduced bias of amino acids generated by the mixed nucleotides in the displayed peptides and increased peptide diversity, as compared with that of the M13 filamentous peptide library. By using this library, we tried to isolate novel IgG-binding peptide ligands. In the process of this research, we identified several peptide sequences sharing high consensus motifs with extremely high binding specificity to human IgG. Unexpectedly, however, this peptide motif did not recognize the normal conformation of human IgG. To identify the target species for our peptides, we examined the binding of our peptides to human IgG treated with a purification process and found that our peptides targeted particular conformational species, which was induced by acid treatment of human IgG. We refer to this alternative conformer as an “acid conformer.” Acidic pH conditions are not only used for elution of IgG from the Protein A column, but are also used as a method for eradicating virus contamination (2Food and Drug Administration Control of Microbiological Contamination, Code of Federal Regulations 21, 211.113. U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.2003Google Scholar, 13Brorson K. Krejci S. Lee K. Hamilton E. Stein K. Xu Y. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 82: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It has been reported that, when antibodies are exposed to acidic pH conditions, a conformer with properties that are different to normal IgG is generated (14Ejima D. Tsumoto K. Fukada H. Yumioka R. Nagase K. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Proteins. 2007; 66: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although the effects of acid treatment on antibody structure has been studied using mouse or rabbit IgG (15Buchner J. Renner M. Lilie H. Hinz H.J. Jaenicke R. Kiefhabel T. Rudolph R.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the properties of the acid conformer are not fully understood. This is the first report describing the generation conditions and biophysical characteristics of the human IgG acid conformer that was identified using a specific affinity ligand. Our data will aid understanding of the causes and mechanisms of dysfunction and aggregation of IgG that occur during acid treatment and storage of IgG. Materials-Polyclonal human IgG was purchased from ICN/Cappel Biomedicals, Aurora, OH. Human transferrin, human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), 4The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; IL-6R, interleukin-6 receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SA, streptavidin; RU, response unit. and Staphylococcus aureus Protein A were purchased from Sigma. Human IgG Fc fragment (IgG-Fc), human IgA, and human IgE were purchased from Athens Research & Technology, Athens, GA. Mouse IgG, mouse IgA, and mouse IgE were purchased from PharMingen, San Diego, CA. Gelatin was purchased from Wako Chemicals, Arcadia, CA. The humanized anti-human interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) therapeutic antibody Tocilizumab (MRA) and the humanized anti-HER2 therapeutic antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) were kindly provided by Chugai Pharmaceutical Corporation Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. Recombinant human IL-6R and the CTLA4/Fc fusion protein were purchased fromR&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. Recombinant human Fcγ receptor (FcγR) Ia, IIb, and IIIa were purchased from Abnova Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan. Random Peptide T7 Phage Libraries and Biopanning against Human IgG-Fc-The T7 phage libraries displaying CX7-10C or X3CX7-10CX3 random peptides used here (X is a mixture of twenty amino acid residues) were constructed as described previously (12Krumpe L.R. Atkinson A.J. Smythers G.W. Kandel A. Schumacher K.M. McMahon J.B. Makowski L. Mori T. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 4210-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Microplate wells (Nunc Maxisorp) were coated with human IgG-Fc (1 μg/300 μl/well) and blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS. The T7 phage libraries (1.5 × 1011 pfu) of CX7-10C or X3CX7-10CX3 were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the wells five times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (0.1% PBST) (second round, 0.1% PBST, 10 s incubation × five times; third round, 0.3% PBST, 10 s incubation × 10 times; fourth and fifth rounds, 0.5% PBST, 2 min incubation × 10 times), BLT5615 Escherichia coli cells were added, infected by phages, and cultured for phage propagation. The phages recovered from the culture supernatants were precipitated with polyethylene glycol, dissolved in PBS, filtered through a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose filter, and used for the next round of panning, according to the manufacturer’s recommendation (Novagen). After five rounds of panning, the phages were monocloned on the culture plates forming phage plaques. Preparation of Synthetic Peptides-Biotinylated ethylene glycol spacerarmed peptides IMG1 (biotin-PEO4-GCGYWRSEWGLCG), IMG-1E6Q (biotin-PEO4-GCGYWR-SQWGLCG), IMG4 (biotin-PEO4-GCTGYWPKAWGLCG), IMG4-K6R (biotin-PEO4-GCTGYW-PRAWGLCG), CS (biotin-PEO4-GSGYWRSEWGLSG), and Fc-III (biotin-PEO4-GDCAWHLGELV-WCT, C-terminal amidate blocked) were chemically synthesized by Fmoc protection chemistry and subsequent biotinylation with NHS-PEO4-Biotin (Sigma). After the protecting groups were removed, all peptides were purified on C-18 reversed-phase columns. Peptide cyclization via disulfide bond formation was performed in dimethyl sulfoxide by air oxidation. The intramolecular disulfide formation was confirmed by liquid chromatographic mass spectrometry on the Acquity SQD ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (Waters). Detection of Human IgG Interaction with Phages or Synthetic Peptides by ELISA-Each microplate well (Nunc Maxisorp) was coated with human IgG, other control proteins (100 ng/50 μl/well), or 100-fold diluted human serum in PBS, and blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS. Phages were added to each well and incubated. The bound phages were detected with biotinylated anti-T7 phage mouse antibody (Novagen) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (SA) (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK). To estimate the content of bound phages, tetramethylbenzidine colorimetry solution (Wako Chemicals), a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated peroxidase substrate, was added to each well, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader. For peptide ELISA, biotinylated IMG4K6R, Fc-III, or CS peptide (500 nm) were pre-incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated (AP-conjugated) SA (120 nm, Vector) to form an SA-peptide complex, and the mixture was added to the wells. After incubation for 1 h, the wells were washed three times with 0.1% PBST. To estimate the content of the bound peptide complex, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Wako Chemicals), an AP substrate, was added to each well, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Acid Treatment of Human IgG-Acid treatment at low pH was performed using 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3.5-2.2) for specified incubation times at room temperature and subsequently neutralized by adding 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.1). After treatment, IgG was stored at 4 °C until use. Immunoprecipitation of Human IgG by Magnetic Beads-Immobilization of biotinylated IMG1, IMG1E6Q, IMG4, IMG4K6R, and Fc-III peptides (200 pmol) on Dynabeads M-280 SA magnetic beads (0.2 mg) (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. After blocking with 0.5% BSA in PBS, the beads were reacted with 100 μl of commercially available polyclonal human IgG (200 μg/ml) in PBS containing 0.5% BSA or human serum diluted with PBS (100-fold) on a rotary incubator for 1 h. After washing three times with 0.1% PBST, beads were added to SDS sample buffer containing 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled, and then applied to a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp. Billercia, MA). The membrane was blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS and subjected to Western blot analysis using biotin-conjugated anti-human IgG goat antibody (Vector) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated SA (Vector Laboratories). The blotted protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using Chemi-Lumi One (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). Purification of Acid Conformer of Human IgG-Biotinylated IMG4K6R peptide was immobilized on a SA HiTrap column (1 ml; GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After blocking the column with 0.5% BSA in PBS and washing with 20 ml of PBS, 1 ml MRA solution treated with acidic conditions (pH 2.7 × 60 min) was applied to the IMG4K6R peptide column. PBS (1 ml) was injected into the column, and the eluate was collected as the excluded fraction. The column was then washed with 20 ml PBS, and the bound proteins were eluted with 1 ml of 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.7), neutralized immediately by adding 100 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.1), and stored at 4 °C until use. After use, the column was regenerated with 20 ml of PBS and stored at 4 °C. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis-SPR analysis was performed on a BIAcore 2000 (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C. All reagents and sensor chips were purchased from GE Healthcare. Immobilization of the biotinylated IMG4K6R peptide on the SA sensor chip was done by injecting 100 μm peptide solution at pH 7.0. The amount of the immobilized peptide was adjusted to 200-400 response units (RU). To regenerate the sensor chip, 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.7) was used. The association reaction was monitored by injecting several concentrations of IgG dissolved in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20) into the sensor chip at a flow rate of 10 or 100 μl/min. The dissociation phase was monitored by HBS buffer flow. The binding kinetic parameters were calculated by BIAevaluation 3.2 software (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). To assess the inhibitory activity of Protein A toward the interaction between IMG4K6R peptide and the acid conformer, the acid-treated MRA (100 ng/μl, 660 nm) was preincubated with Protein A (1-100 μg/μl, 0.24-24 μm) for 1 h and injected into an IMG4K6R peptide-immobilized flow cell. To estimate the binding activity of the acid conformer to the antigen or FcγRs, the acid-treated MRA (100 ng/μl, 660 nm) was injected into the IMG4K6R peptide-immobilized flow cell. Subsequently, human IL-6R (antigen) or human FcγR (FcRIa, IIb, or IIIa; 5-20 ng/μl) was injected to monitor the association and dissociation reactions. Isolation of Human IgG-specific Phage Clones from Random Peptide Phage Libraries-Five rounds of biopanning against human IgG-Fc were performed using T7 phage libraries displaying CX7-10C or X3CX7-10CX3. Human IgG-Fc binding phages were enriched in CX7-10C libraries at the fourth and fifth rounds, but not in the X3CX7-10CX3 libraries (Fig. 1A). The binding assays for the phage clones isolated after the fourth and fifth panning rounds were done by ELISA, and the DNA sequences of the positive clones were determined. Six individual phage clones (G1-6) were identified (Table 1) and showed specific binding to human IgG but not to other immunoglobulins or control proteins (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Comparison of the amino acid sequences of human IgG-binding peptides type II (G1-6) and type I (Fc-III) Open table in a new tab Binding Specificity of Type II Synthetic Peptide to Human IgG-The peptide sequences displayed on the phage clones shared a high consensus [C (T/-) (G) YW (P/A) (R) (E) WGLC; ≥80% of the preserved amino acids are indicated outside parentheses, while those preserved at ≥30% are within] and were named the type II motif. This was clearly different from the type I motif (Fc-III, DCAWHLGELVWCT) reported by DeLano et al. (9DeLano W.L. Ultsch M.H. de Vos A.M. Wells J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) (Table). The binding specificities of the type I (Fc-III) and type II (IMG4K6R: CTGYWPRAWGLC) synthetic peptides were compared by ELISA using various antibodies. Both peptides bound to human IgGs including therapeutic and IgG1-4 isotype human antibodies (Fig. 2). Moreover, IMG4K6R exhibited binding activity toward the CTLA4/human Fc fusion protein, indicating that the binding site of the type II peptide was specific to the Fc region. While IMG4K6R was highly specific to human IgG-Fc and did not bind the mouse IgG, Fc-III recognized rabbit and goat IgG as well as mouse and human IgG, as shown in Fig. 2, suggesting that IMG4K6R and Fc-III possess different binding properties. Recognition of the Acid Conformer of Human IgG Using the Type II Peptide-Despite sufficient binding of Fc-III to the human serum containing IgG, IMG4K6R did not show clear binding in the ELISA (Fig. 2). To confirm this observation, binding experiments were performed by immunoprecipitation with type II peptide-immobilized magnetic beads using human serum or commercial polyclonal human IgG (Fig. 3A). IgG was recovered from the polyclonal human IgG solution (Fig. 3A, left panel, lanes 1-4) with several type II peptides, but almost no IgG was pulled down from human serum (Fig. 3A, right panel, lanes 1-4). To explain this observation, we suggest that type II peptides recognize abnormal (irregular) structures that are contained in commercial human IgG but not in serum. Because commercial polyclonal human IgG is generally purified using Protein A columns, we speculated that the irregular structures might have arisen from the purification process. Therefore, we purified IgG from human serum using a Protein A column with acidic pH elution (pH 2.2 and 2.7), followed by immediate neutralization. Although no IgG was recovered from human serum with type II peptide beads before Protein A purification (Fig. 3B, lane 2), a considerable amount of IgG was precipitated from the human IgG solution after purification (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). One plausible explanation for this observation is that the low pH used for the elution generates structures other than normal human IgG. To investigate this finding, we examined the binding of IgG to type II peptide beads before and after acid treatment (pH 2.7). The binding of IgG to the IMG4K6R beads was very weak before acid treatment, but increased dramatically after treatment (Fig. 3C, left panel). This suggests that exposure of human IgG to acidic conditions induces a conformational change to an alternative structure, i.e. the acid conformer, which is specifically recognized by type II peptides. In contrast, the apparent binding between human IgG and Fc-III did not change before and after treatment (Fig. 3C, right panel). Generation of the acid conformer, as detected by the type II peptide, was observed at a pH lower than 3.0 at room temperature within a short period of time (30 s), as shown in Fig. 3D. Detection of the Acid Conformer by SPR Analysis-The generation of the acid conformer was examined by SPR analysis using a type II peptide-immobilized sensor chip. Although there were no binding responses on the sensorgram before acid treatment at pH 2.7, a remarkable increase in the signal (∼2500 RU at 350 s after injection) was observed after acid treatment (Fig. 4A). This finding indicates that SPR analysis using the type II peptide-immobilized sensor chip is a sensitive and convenient method for monitoring generation of the acid conformer. The binding between the immobilized type II peptide and the purified acid conformer was very strong with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.5 nm (Fig. 4B). The effect of temperature on the generation of acid conformer was examined using the SPR system (Fig. 4C). The rate of acid conformer generation at pH 2.7 increased as temperature increased from 4-40 °C. This dependence of the generation rate on temperature may reflect the finding that the mobility or fluctuation of IgG induced by the increased temperature is favorable for conformational changes to the acid conformer. Characterization of the Acid Conformer-To characterize the binding sites of the type II peptide on the acid conformer, competitive inhibition assays of type II peptide with Protein A were performed using SPR analysis (Fig. 5A). The SPR signal arising from the binding of the acid conformer to the immobilized type II peptide was reduced by the addition of Protein A (0.24-24 μm) in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that the binding site of the type II peptide overlapped with or was adjacent to the region recognized by Protein A. To examine the functionality of the acid conformer, we evaluated the antigenand FcγR -binding capacities of the acid conformer. The acid conformer was trapped on the type II peptide-immobilized sensor chip on BIAcore and an antigen (IL-6R) or FcγR were subsequently injected (Fig. 5B). The acid conformer maintained binding activities to both the antigen and the FcγR, suggesting that conformational changes of the acid conformer are probably limited to the Fc regions (Fig. 5C). In addition, a circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the purified acid conformer indicated a high content of beta-sheet structures despite a slight increase in random structures (supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore, gel permeation chromatography of the purified acid conformer revealed that ≥90% of the molecules were present as monomers (supplemental Fig. 2). Combining these data, we tentatively concluded that the conformational changes of the acid conformer is limited to the CH2 and CH3 regions, and does not have features typical of denatured structures. Conformational Changes Were Not Correlated with Removal of the Carbohydrate in IgG-Conformational changes of the acid conformer seemed to occur predominantly in the Fc region (Fig. 5). Recently, it was reported that the FcγR-binding activity of IgG is modulated by the removal of a carbohydrate structure attached to the CH2 domain of IgG through dynamic or static structural changes around the hinge region, although the mechanism is not fully understood (17Sethuraman N. Stadheim T.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2006; 17: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 18Yamaguchi Y. Nishimura M. Nagano M. Yagi H. Sasakawa H. Uchida K. Shitara K. Kato K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We assessed the binding ability of the carbohydrate-free IgG to the type II peptide using a precipitation-binding assay with type II peptide-immobilized beads (Fig. 6). The carbohydrate-free IgG was prepared by endoglycosidase digestion and characterized by the decrease in the apparent molecular size of the heavy chain (48 kDa) on SDS-PAGE. This molecule did not bind to the type II peptide, indicating that there is no correlation between the acid conformer and the structural changes induced by removing the carbohydrate from IgG. In contrast, the binding of type I peptide (Fc-III) and Protein A to human IgG was not affected by removing the carbohydrate from IgG. In this study, we identified a new and unique peptide motif that exhibits specific binding to the non-native conformation of human IgG, which was induced by acid treatment. Although several IgG-binding peptide sequences have already been reported (5Ehrlich G.K. Bailon P. J. Mol. Recognit. 1998; 11: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Krook M. Mosbach K.

Science. 2000; 287: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), such peptides cannot recognize such conformationally changed IgG species. Several explanations are possible for the reason why we could isolate a type II peptide motif, even though the acid conformer is a minor component of the human IgG samples. One reason is the difference between the peptide libraries expressed by filamentous M13 and lytic T7 phage display systems. T7 phage display library show less bias in the displayed amino acids, which allows greater coverage of a variety of peptide sequences in the library (12Krumpe L.R. Atkinson A.J. Smythers G.W. Kandel A. Schumacher K.M. McMahon J.B. Makowski L. Mori T. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 4210-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The display of a part of the peptide sequences in the library may be restricted in the M13 display system. In fact, the display of the Trp cage motif for peptide library construction was successful in the T7 phage but not in the M13 phage (19Herman R.E. Badders D. Fuller M. Makienko E.G. Houston Jr., M.E. Quay S.C. Johnson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9813-9824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), probably because of the incompatibility of the Trp cage motif and the biological constraints of the M13 system, which needs the displayed peptides to penetrate the cell membrane (20Castagnoli L. Zucconi A. Quondam M. Rossi M. Vaccaro P. Panni S. Paoluzi S. Santonico E. Dente L. Cesareni G. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2001; 4: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The other reason is the slow dissociation rate of the complex between the acid conformer and the type II peptide (kd = 7.0 × 10-5 s-1, Fig. 4B). Because we used a strict washing procedure in biopanning selections, the T7 phages that are specific to normal human IgG might be washed out early. In fact, we also succeeded in isolating peptide motifs that were very similar to the type I peptide (data not shown). However, this succeeded only when the type II peptide binding sites of the human IgG-Fc on the plastic plate were masked in advance by adding the IMG4K6R synthetic peptide to the biopanning solution and the washing procedure was gentle. Using the type II peptide, we identified an alternative conformer of human IgG and we have described the biophysical characteristics of this unique conformer. The existence of an acid conformer has been suggested in several reports. For example, Buchner et al. reported that the treatment of mouse monoclonal antibody MAK33 (IgG1/κ) at pH 3.0 leads to different structures, which exhibited properties similar to the folding intermediates, and the increased hydrophobic molecular surfaces maintained a high content of secondary structures and showed cooperative unfolding against heat and denaturation (15Buchner J. Renner M. Lilie H. Hinz H.J. Jaenicke R. Kiefhabel T. Rudolph R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6922-6929Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Martsev et al. reported that, by exposing the rabbit IgG to pH 2, a partially structured conformer was generated, which was characterized by conformational loss, probably in the CH2 domain, and by maintaining the well-defined tertiary structure in other domain regions. Furthermore, the IgG that was refolded at pH 7 after heat denaturation at pH 2 contained a non-native conformer with different binding capacities to the C1q complement and Protein A (16Martsev S.P. Kravchuk Z.I. Vlasov A.P. Lyakhnovich G.V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, Ejima et al. studied the effects of acid exposure on conformational changes in human IgG4 and showed that the molecular species of the non-denatured structures with limited structural changes are generated by exposure to pH 2.7-3.9 by CD and differential scanning colorimetry (14Ejima D. Tsumoto K. Fukada H. Yumioka R. Nagase K. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Proteins. 2007; 66: 954-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that acidity induces alternative structures of IgG. Although we must further investigate whether the acid conformer that we identified using the type II peptide is identical to these previously reported structures, they seem to share common characteristics including a high content of secondary structures (beta-sheet), the majority of molecules present in the monomeric form and increased hydrophobicity. Type II peptides are thought to bind to the CH2-CH3 domain on the Fc region of human IgG, because binding of the type II peptide is inhibited by Protein A (Fig. 5A). As depicted in Fig. 5C, this binding region on IgG involves the hotspot region, which is also recognized by Protein G, neonatal FcR (FcRn) (21Ghetie V. Ward E.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 739-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), rheumatoid factors (RFs) (22Newkirk M.M. Clin. Immunol. (Orlando). 2002; 104: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and type I peptide (9DeLano W.L. Ultsch M.H. de Vos A.M. Wells J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Competitive inhibition of type II peptide binding using Protein A indicates that the conformational changes in the acid conformer occurred in the region that contains the hotspot. Although we cannot currently identify the precise binding site of the type II peptide, the previous papers described the suggestive but controversial results that the domain is affected by acid treatment. Martsev et al. proposed that the CH2 domain of rabbit IgG is destroyed by acid treatment (16Martsev S.P. Kravchuk Z.I. Vlasov A.P. Lyakhnovich G.V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, Thies et al. who used the isolated CH3 domain of murine IgG, demonstrated that the CH3 domain could possess an alternative conformational state induced by acidic pH (23Thies M.J. Kammermeier R. Richter K. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taken together, the conformational changes in the acid conformer may extend from the CH2 to the CH3 region, although the degree of the structural changes seems to be limited, considering that the Protein A binding ability is maintained by the acid conformer. The unfavorable biological aspects, including toxicity or immunogenicity of the acid conformer in human body, are still unknown. Martsev et al. suggested that acid-treated IgG exhibited stronger binding to complement C1q than that of native IgG (16Martsev S.P. Kravchuk Z.I. Vlasov A.P. Lyakhnovich G.V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), indicating that such species could cause anaphylactic shock via immune stimulation with complement activation. Although the acid conformer is not contained in human therapeutics such as MRA (Tocilizumab) and Herceptin (Trastuzumab), <5% of the acid conformer is detected in commercially available polyclonal IgG (data not shown). Because the generation of the acid conformer is rapidly accelerated at high temperatures (Fig. 4C), the temperature reached during acid treatment should be monitored. The purified acid conformer remained in a monomeric form at 4 °C under neutral pH in the low concentrations (<10 μg/ml) used in this study. However, when acid-treated IgG was incubated at high temperatures (25 or 37 °C) under high concentration (300 μg/ml), aggregate formations were visible (supplemental Fig. 3). This suggests that the acid conformer may be the starting material of the aggregates formed during the storage of antibody solutions. Based on these findings, the type II peptide described in this study is valuable for the detection or elimination of acid conformers, which potentially cause the aggregation of IgG. In summary, our report described a key tool to elucidate the mechanisms of antibody aggregation and dysfunction in acidic conditions.

Alanine mutations were made in the S6 segments, chosen on the basis of their roles in other NaV subtypes; whole cell patch clamp recordings were made from mammalian ND7/23 cells. Mutations of some residues caused shifts in voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and gave faster time course of inactivation, indicating that the residues mutated play important roles in both activation and inactivation in the NaV1.8 channel. The resting and inactivated state affinities of tetracaine for the channel were reduced by mutations I381A, F1710A, and Y1717A (for the latter only inactivated state affinity was measured), and by mutation F1710A for the NaV1.8-selective compound A-803467, showing the involvement of these residues for each compound, respectively. For both compounds, mutation L1410A caused the unexpected appearance of a complete resting block even at extremely low concentrations. Resting block of native channels by compound A-803467 could be partially removed (“disinhibition”) by repetitive stimulation or by a test pulse after recovery from inactivation; the magnitude of the latter effect was increased for all the mutants studied. Tetracaine did not show this effect for native channels, but disinhibition was seen particularly for mutants L1410A and F1710A. The data suggest differing, but partially overlapping, areas of binding of A-803467 and tetracaine. Docking of the ligands into a three-dimensional model of the NaV1.8 channel gave interesting insight as to how the ligands may interact with pore residues.

Docking of the ligands into a three-dimensional model of the NaV1.8 channel gave interesting insight as to how the ligands may interact with pore residues. Voltage-gated Na+ channels are essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells and are the molecular targets for local anesthetics and other compounds (1Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. Waxman S.G. Pharmacol. Rev... 2005; 57: 397-409Google Scholar, 2Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes.Sinauer, Sunderland, MA. 2001; Google Scholar). The major structural component of voltage-gated Na+ channels is a large (230–270kDa) α-subunit, which is alone sufficient to form a functional Na+ conducting channel. This subunit contains four homologous domains (I–IV), each containing six membrane-spanning segments (S1–S6) (3Catterall W.A. Neuron.. 2000; 26: 13-25Google Scholar). In response to membrane depolarization, an outward movement of the positively charged S4 segments induces the conformational changes in the pore leading to the conducting activated state (4Yang N. George Jr. A.L. Horn R. Neuron.. 1996; 16: 113-122Google Scholar). The channels then enter inactivated states within a few milliseconds of channel opening.To date, nine distinct α-subunit subtypes (NaV1.1 to NaV1.9) have been identified that differ in their primary structure, ionic permeation, tissue distribution, functional properties, and pharmacology (5Goldin A.L.

The NaV1.8 channel is responsible for the slowly-inactivating tetrodotoxin-insensitive Na+ current of small diameter neurons of dorsal root ganglion cells (6Akopian A.N. Sivilotti L. Wood J.N.

The NaV1.8 channel plays a clear role in pain signaling following noxious mechanical and cold stimulation, and particularly in inflammation-induced thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia (10Abrahamsen B.

The NaV1.7 channel also plays a role in pain signaling; indeed lack of function of the NaV1.7 channel in congenital disorders leads to insensitivity to certain types of pain (19Cox J.J. Reimann F. Nicholas A.K. Thornton G. Roberts E. Springell K. Karbani G. Jafri H. Mannan J. Raashid Y. Al-Gazali L. Hamamy H. Valente E.M. Gorman S. Williams R. McHale D.P. Wood J.N. Gribble F.M. Woods C.G. Nature.. 2006; 444: 894-898Google Scholar).Local anesthetics and other chemically related agents bind selectively to the open or inactivated state of sodium channels, leading to use-dependent block during periods of repetitive firing or sustained depolarization (20Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol... 1977; 69: 497-515Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, the molecular determinants for drug block in NaV1.2 to NaV1.5 sodium channels were identified as a number of key pore-lining amino acid residues of the IS6, IIIS6, and IVS6 segments (21Catterall W.A. Novartis Found. Symp. Discussion 218–232.. 2002; 241: 206-218Google Scholar, 22Nau C. Wang G.K. J. Membr. Biol... 2004; 201: 1-8Google Scholar). These S6 residues correspond to NaV1.8 amino acids Ile381, Asn390 in domain I, Leu1410, Asn1411, Val1414 in domain III, and Ile1706, Phe1710, Tyr1717 in domain IV (Fig. 1). These mutations also produced appreciable shifts in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, supporting the role of S6 segment amino acid residues in the gating mechanisms. Thus, the transmembrane S6 segments appear to be important for both the functional properties and drug binding in a number of NaV subtypes.The NaV1.8 channel shows both slower kinetics and more depolarized voltage-dependent activation and inactivation than other NaV subtypes (6Akopian A.N. Sivilotti L. Wood J.N. Nature.. 1996; 379: 257-262Google Scholar, 7Rabert D.K. Koch B.D. Ilnicka M. Obernolte R.A. Naylor S.L. Herman R.C. Eglen R.M. Hunter J.C. Sangameswaran L.

Chem... 1996; 271: 5953-5956Google Scholar), although the voltage dependence of inactivation of human NaV1.8 occurs at less depolarized potentials (23Akiba I. Seki T. Mori M. Iizuka M. Nishimura S. Sasaki S. Imoto K. Barsoumian E.L. Receptors Channels.. 2003; 9: 291-299Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite highly homologous S6 segments between NaV1.8 and the other subtypes, differences in drug action from the other subtypes have been observed. For example, compared with tetrodotoxin-sensitive channels, use-dependent block by lidocaine is more pronounced for NaV1.8 (24Leffler A. Reiprich A. Mohapatra D.P. Nau C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther... 2007; 320: 354-364Google Scholar, 25Roy M.L. Narahashi T. J. Neurosci... 1992; 12: 2104-2111Google Scholar) and remarkably, inactivated state block by compound A-803467 is more than 100-fold more selective for NaV1.8 (9Jarvis M.F. Honore P. Shieh C.C. Chapman M. Joshi S. Zhang X.F. Kort M. Carroll W. Marron B. Atkinson R. Thomas J. Liu D. Krambis M. Liu Y. McGaraughty S. Chu K. Roeloffs R. Zhong C. Mikusa J.P. Hernandez G. Gauvin D. Wade C. Zhu C.

Rev. Neurother... 2007; 7: 1597-1612Google Scholar). Furthermore, compound A-803467 showed an unusual removal of resting block (“disinhibition”) for the human NaV1.8 channel during repetitive stimulation. 2Browne, L. E., Clare, J. J., and Wray, D. (2009) Neuropharmacology 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2009.01.018.Whereas the role of the S6 transmembrane segments in voltage-gated Na+ channel functional properties and drug binding is well established for other subtypes, and the key residues have been identified (see above), the corresponding residues for the NaV1.8 subtype are yet to be investigated. Here we have used whole-cell patch clamp to study the functional properties of mutant NaV1.8 channels containing alanine substitutions at the corresponding key positions in the S6 segments. The effect of these mutations on the action of compound A-803467 (Fig. 1) on the NaV1.8 channel was investigated, and compared with the actions of tetracaine (Fig. 1), to further understand the action of this compound, which selectively acts on this promising therapeutic target for anti-nociceptive drugs. In this study for the first time the drug binding sites of the NaV1.8 channel have been addressed, and furthermore, we have investigated the human channel in an appropriate mammalian host background more like the native situation, rather than in oocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis of Human Nav1.8 Channels—The human NaV1.8 α-subunit (Swiss-Prot accession Q9Y5Y9, polymorph 1073V, Ref. 7Rabert D.K.

Witherspoon S.M. Clay W.C. Kost T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 127-132Google Scholar) was used in this study. Mutant channels I381A, N390A, L1410A, V1414A, I1706A, F1710A, and Y1717A were generated using the QuikChange XL Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) together with appropriate mutagenic primers. All mutations were validated by restriction mapping and sequencing of the entire channel cDNA.ND7/23 cells (ECACC, Salisbury, UK) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1× non-essential amino acids. Cells were seeded at 60% confluence and co-transfected with 3.0 μg of wild type or mutant NaV1.8 α-subunit cDNA and 0.3 μg of EBO-pCD-Leu2 cDNA (for CD8 marker) or pEGFP-N1 cDNA (for fluorescence marker) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfection-positive cells were identified 2–4 days after transfection with Immunobeads (anti-CD8 Dynabeads; Invitrogen) or green fluorescence.Electrophysiological Recording and Data Analysis—Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C) using patch pipettes pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries and coated with Sigmacote (Sigma). Pipettes (tip resistances 1.5–2.5 MΩ) were filled with solution containing (mm): CsF, 120; HEPES, 10; EGTA, 10; and NaCl, 15 adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. Cells were continuously perfused with an external solution containing (mm): NaCl, 140; HEPES, 5; MgCl2, 1.3; CaCl2, 1; glucose, 11; and KCl, 4.7, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Tetrodotoxin (200 nm, Tocris) was used to block endogenous Na+ channel currents.Cells were allowed to equilibrate for 10 min in the whole-cell configuration before currents were acquired using an Axopatch-1C or Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) filtered at 5 kHz, and sampled at 10 kHz using pClamp8 or pClamp9 software (Clampex; Molecular Devices). The online P/4 subtraction procedure was used to subtract linear leak and capacitance currents where appropriate. Clampfit versions 9 or 10 (Molecular Devices) and Origin version 5.0 (MicroCal Inc.) were used for offline data analysis.Conductance-voltage curves were determined from the peak sodium current (INa), using the equation: GNa = INa/(V - ENa), where V is the membrane potential and ENa is the reversal potential obtained from the I–V curve for each cell. These curves were fit with the Boltzmann equation: G = Gmax/(1 + exp((V½ - V)/k)), where Gmax is maximum conductance, V½ is the potential for half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. Voltage-dependence of inactivation curves were fit with the Boltzmann equation: I = A +(B - A)/(1 + exp((V - V½)/k)), where B is the maximum current, A is the amplitude of a non-inactivating component, V½ is the potential for half-maximal inactivation.Inactivation time constants were obtained by fitting the decay phase of individual currents with double exponential fits. Recovery from inactivation was studied in twin pulse experiments, and the time course of recovery was fit with double exponentials; in the presence of some drugs used, a third exponential was required.All test compounds were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted to the desired concentration in the external solution giving a final concentration of ≤1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Control test currents were recorded before the application of compounds. Compounds were applied during a 3–4-min incubation period after which currents were recorded in the continual presence of test compound. The dissociation constants for resting channels (Kr) and inactivated channels (Ki) were determined using the model of Kuo and Bean (28Kuo C.C. Bean B.P. Mol. Pharmacol... 1994; 46: 716-725Google Scholar) as described by Liu et al. (29Liu G. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Nobbs M. Clare J.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuropharmacology.. 2003; 44: 413-422Google Scholar) and Yarov-Yarovoy et al. (30Yarov-Yarovoy V. McPhee J.C. Idsvoog D. Pate C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 35393-35401Google Scholar). The resting state drug dissociation constant was calculated using a test pulse before and after drug application from a resting potential of -120 mV, at which channels are in the resting state. The dissociation constants were determined using Kr = [D]/((1/IDr) - 1), where D is the concentration of test compound and IDr is the peak test current amplitude in the presence of drug expressed as a fraction of the peak test current amplitude in the absence of drug. The protocol for obtaining inactivated state dissociation constants is shown in Fig. 5C, where a 4-s depolarizing pulse was used to inactivate currents, and a test pulse before and after drug application was used to measure the extent of inactivated current block. The inactivated state dissociation constants were calculated using Ki = [D](1 - h)/((1/IDi) - 1), where D is the concentration of test compound, h is the fraction of non-inactivated sodium current (in the absence of the compound) following the 4-s depolarization, and IDi is the peak test current amplitude in the presence of drug expressed as a fraction of the peak test current amplitude in the absence of drug (Fig. 5C). The voltage of the 4-s depolarizing pulse was chosen to always give approximately the same (60–80%) inactivation in wild type and mutant channels; the measurement of the Ki value should therefore only represent the effect of the mutation on drug binding rather than any effect of the mutation on inactivation itself. Indeed, in previous work the effects of mutations on inactivation and on the Ki value were not found to correlate (29Liu G. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Nobbs M. Clare J.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuropharmacology.. 2003; 44: 413-422Google Scholar, 30Yarov-Yarovoy V. McPhee J.C. Idsvoog D. Pate C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 35393-35401Google Scholar). Statistics are presented as mean ± S.E., and the Student's t test was used to test significance.FIGURE 5Dissociation constants for resting and inactivated states of mutant NaV1.8 channels.

It was not possible to determine the resting state dissociation constant for mutation Y1717A under the conditions used here, because a large proportion (23%) of channels are inactivated at a holding potential of -120 mV as a consequence of the strong negative shift in the inactivation curve. C, the figure shows the twin pulse protocol used to determine the inactivated state affinities (Ki). This was used before and after test compound application; the depicted 4-s depolarizing pulse was to potentials such that 60–80% inactivation was observed. In the case of mutant Y1717A, the resting level of inactivation at -120 mV (as above) was taken into account in obtaining the parameter h. D, the figure shows example current traces elicited by the pulse protocol in C, where currents in bold are before test compound application and fine traces are after test compound application; the currents larger in magnitude correspond to the control pulses and currents smaller in magnitude correspond to the test pulse following a 4-s depolarization.

More recently, however, a structure of the rat KV1.2 potassium channel has been solved (31Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science.. 2005; 309: 897-903Google Scholar). It was considered that this would be closer in structure to human NaV1.8, and our model was therefore based on its homology with this structure (PDB code 2A79). Our model consisted of the S5 helices, P-loop, and S6 helices (along with the short linker between the P-loop and the S6 helix in the first domain). Whereas sequence alignments between the rat KV1.2 channel and NaV1.8 domains were unsuccessful; Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plots (32Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol... 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) were used to identify the S5-P-loop-S6 region of each domain. Alignment of the loops was made so as to form a good filter geometry with the DEKA residues. Alignment of the S6 regions was straightforward and was based on the conserved glycine (serine in domain IV). The alignment of the S5 helices was not obvious so use was made of the conservation moment method using the HELANAL program (33Blaney F.E. Tennant M. Membrane Protein Models.(Findlay, J. B. C., ed) pp. Bios Scientific Publishers Ltd., Oxford. 1996; : 161-176Google Scholar). The starting structure was constructed manually using the homology tools within the Quanta program (Wavefunction Inc.). This was subsequently refined by energy minimization with CHARMm (34Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem... 1983; 4: 187-217Google Scholar). Initially the backbone was held fixed but this was subsequently relaxed and the helices were maintained by using distance (“nuclear Overhauser effect”) constraints between the backbone amide bonds. 500 steps of Steepest Descent followed by 5000 steps of Adopted Basis Newton-Rhaphson were used for the minimization phases. The Karplus rotamer library (35Dunbrack Jr. R.L. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol... 1993; 230: 543-574Google Scholar) was used to set the side chain dihedral angles at standard values. The two ligands were constructed with the Spartan program using HF-3–21G* charges (accelrys.com). They were docked manually into the protein in multiple poses, ensuring each time that initial side chain dihedral angles were set at the rotamer library values. Each pose was minimized as above and ranked according to interaction energy.RESULTSEffects of S6 Segment Mutations on the Functional Properties of the NaV1.8 Channel—Mutations were chosen at positions in the S6 segments of domains I, III, and IV of the NaV1.8 channel, corresponding to the positions found in other NaV channel subtypes where a number of drugs have been found to act (21Catterall W.A. Novartis Found. Symp. Discussion 218–232.. 2002; 241: 206-218Google Scholar, 22Nau C. Wang G.K. J. Membr. Biol... 2004; 201: 1-8Google Scholar). Example current traces for each human NaV1.8 channel mutation are shown in Fig. 2. The voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 3A) was measured at a holding potential of -120 mV. Conductance-voltage relationships for some of the mutant NaV1.8 channels showed shifts in the curves as compared with wild type channels (Fig. 3A); a 9-mV shift to more positive potentials was observed for mutations N390A and V1414A (Fig. 3B), and negative shifts of ∼6 mV were observed for mutations I381A and F1710A. The V½ for activation was unaffected by mutations L1410A, I1706A, and Y1717A. The k values were not affected by most of the mutations, although there were small but significant reductions for two of the mutants (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 2Example current traces for human NaV1.8 channels. Current traces are shown for ND7/23 cells transfected with wild type or mutant hNaV1.8 channel cDNA in the presence of 200 nm tetrodotoxin. Currents were elicited for voltage steps to -100 to +60 mV (in 10-mV increments) from a holding potential of -120 mV. The peak current amplitudes were -79 ± 7 pA/pF (n = 79) for wild type NaV1.8, -53 ± 5 pA/pF (n = 50) for mutant I381A, -112 ± 21 pA/pF (n = 52) for mutant N390A, -32 ± 5 pA/pF (n = 31) for mutant L1410A, -64 ± 6 pA/pF (n = 58) for mutant V1414A, -35 ± 4 pA/pF (n = 38) for mutant I1706A, -69 ± 7 pA/pF (n = 45) for mutant F1710A, and -40 ± 3 pA/pF (n = 54) for mutant Y1717A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Effects of S6 mutations on Na+ channel activation and inactivation.

The steady-state inactivation curves show that all the mutations except F1710A showed shifts to more negative potentials (Fig. 3, C and D). The k values were not significantly affected as compared with wild type (10.5 ± 0.4 mV, n = 84), except for mutations L1410A (decrease in k to 6.4 ± 0.4 mV, n = 6) and Y1717A (increase in k to 15.6 ± 1.2 mV, n = 14). For wild type channels, inactivation was not complete even at very positive inactivating potentials (A/B parameter in Fig. 3D, see ""Experimental Procedures”); mutations I1706A, F1710A, and Y1717A (all located in the IVS6 segment) showed even less complete inactivation at positive potentials.During depolarizing pulses, inactivation kinetics were faster than wild type for the mutations. An example current trace for V1414A, and the voltage dependence of the inactivation time constant are shown in Fig. 3E for all the mutants. It can be seen that the time constants were generally reduced for the mutants, particularly at the -10 mV test potential (Fig. 3F). Thus the mut"
https://openalex.org/W1966443620,"Therapeutics based on the actions of the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), have recently been introduced for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The serine/threonine kinase Akt is a major mediator of incretin action on the pancreatic islet, increasing beta-cell mass and function and promoting beta-cell survival. The mechanisms underlying incretin activation of Akt are thought to involve an essential phosphoinositide 3-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of threonine 308, similar to the prototypical Akt activator, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). In this study, using activity assays on immunoprecipitated Akt, we discovered that GIP and GLP-1 were capable of stimulating Akt in the INS-1 beta-cell line and isolated mouse islets via a mechanism that did not require phosphoinositide 3-kinase or phosphorylation of Thr(308) and Ser(473), and this pathway involved the production of cAMP. Furthermore, we found that GIP stimulated anti-apoptotic signaling via this alternate mode of Akt activation. We conclude that incretins can activate Akt via a novel noncanonical mechanism that may provide an alternative therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and have broader implications for Akt physiology in human health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2071023973,"JDP2 (Jun dimerization protein 2, an AP-1 transcription factor) is involved in the regulation of the differentiation and proliferation of cells. We report here that JDP2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Jdp2(-/-) MEF) are resistant to replicative senescence. In the absence of JDP2, the level of expression of p16(Ink4a), which is known to rise as normal fibroblasts age, fell significantly when cells were cultured for more than 2 months. Conversely, the overexpression of JDP2 induced the expression of genes for p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf). Moreover, at the promoter of the gene for p16(Ink4a) in Jdp2(-/-) MEF, the extent of methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27), which is important for gene silencing, increased. Polycomb-repressive complexes (PRC-1 and PRC-2), which are responsible for histone methylation, bound efficiently to the promoter to repress the expression of the gene for p16(Ink4a). As a result, JDP2-deficient MEF became resistant to replicative senescence. Our results indicate that JDP2 is involved in the signaling pathway for senescence via epigenetic regulation of the expression of the gene for p16(Ink4a)."
https://openalex.org/W2016937576,"Gene expression profiling has identified cancer prognostic and predictive signatures with superior performance to conventional histopathological or clinical parameters. Consequently, signatures are being incorporated into clinical practice and will soon influence everyday decisions in oncology. However, the slight overlap in the gene identity between signatures for the same cancer type or condition raises questions about their biological and clinical implications. To clarify these issues, better understanding of the molecular properties and possible interactions underlying apparently dissimilar signatures is needed. Here, we evaluated whether the signatures of 24 independent studies are related at the genome, transcriptome or proteome levels. Significant associations were consistently observed across these molecular layers, which suggest the existence of a common cancer cell phenotype. Convergence on cell proliferation and death supports the pivotal involvement of these processes in prognosis, metastasis and treatment response. In addition, functional and molecular associations were identified with the immune response in different cancer types and conditions that complement the contribution of cell proliferation and death. Examination of additional, independent, cancer datasets corroborated our observations. This study proposes a comprehensive strategy for interpreting cancer signatures that reveals common design principles and systems-level properties."
https://openalex.org/W2080882235,"Targeted disruption of murine Cdk2ap1, an inhibitor of CDK2 function and hence G1/S transition, results in the embryonic lethality with a high penetration rate. Detailed timed pregnancy analysis of embryos showed that the lethality occurred between embryonic day 3.5 pc and 5.5 pc, a period of implantation and early development of implanted embryos. Two homozygous knockout mice that survived to term showed identical craniofacial defect, including a short snout and a round forehead. Examination of craniofacial morphology by measuring Snout Length (SL) vs. Face Width (FW) showed that the Cdk2ap1+/− mice were born with a reduced SL/FW ratio compared to the Cdk2ap1+/+ and the reduction was more pronounced in Cdk2ap1−/− mice. A transgenic rescue of the lethality was attempted by crossing Cdk2ap1+/− animals with K14-Cdk2ap1 transgenic mice. Resulting Cdk2ap1+/−:K14-Cdk2ap1 transgenic mice showed an improved incidence of full term animals (16.7% from 0.5%) on a Cdk2ap1−/− background. Transgenic expression of Cdk2ap1 in Cdk2ap1−/−:K14-Cdk2ap1 animals restored SL/FW ratio to the level of Cdk2ap1+/−:K14-Cdk2ap1 mice, but not to that of the Cdk2ap1+/+:K14-Cdk2ap1 mice. Teratoma formation analysis using mESCs showed an abrogated in vivo pluripotency of Cdk2ap1−/− mESCs towards a restricted mesoderm lineage specification. This study demonstrates that Cdk2ap1 plays an essential role in the early stage of embryogenesis and has a potential role during craniofacial morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2103995872,"A key structural element in the ion translocating F-, A-, and V-ATPases is the peripheral stalk, an assembly of two polypeptides that provides a structural link between the ATPase and ion channel domains. Previously, we have characterized the peripheral stalk forming subunits E and H of the A-ATPase from Thermoplasma acidophilum and demonstrated that the two polypeptides interact to form a stable heterodimer with 1:1 stoichiometry (Kish-Trier, E., Briere, L. K., Dunn, S. D., and Wilkens, S. (2008) J. Mol. Biol. 375, 673-685). To define the domain architecture of the A-ATPase peripheral stalk, we have now generated truncated versions of the E and H subunits and analyzed their ability to bind each other. The data show that the N termini of the subunits form an alpha-helical coiled-coil, approximately 80 residues in length, whereas the C-terminal residues interact to form a globular domain containingalpha- and beta-structure. We find that the isolated C-terminal domain of the E subunit exists as a dimer in solution, consistent with a recent crystal structure of the related Pyrococcus horikoshii A-ATPase E subunit (Lokanath, N. K., Matsuura, Y., Kuroishi, C., Takahashi, N., and Kunishima, N. (2007) J. Mol. Biol. 366, 933-944). However, upon the addition of a peptide comprising the C-terminal 21 residues of the H subunit (or full-length H subunit), dimeric E subunit C-terminal domain dissociates to form a 1:1 heterodimer. NMR spectroscopy was used to show that H subunit C-terminal peptide binds to E subunit C-terminal domain via the terminal alpha-helices, with little involvement of the beta-sheet region. Based on these data, we propose a structural model of the A-ATPase peripheral stalk."

Two previously described GLEPP1 substrates, paxillin and Syk, are both required for cytoskeletal rearrangement and cellular motility of leukocytes in chemotaxis. We show here that GLEPP1 inhibitors prevent dephosphorylation of Syk1 and paxillin in resting cells and block primary human monocyte and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage chemotaxis in a gradient of monocyte chemotactic protein-1. In mice, the GLEPP1 inhibitors also reduce thioglycolate-induced peritoneal chemotaxis of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages. In murine disease models, the GLEPP1 inhibitors significantly reduce severity of contact hypersensitivity, a model for allergic dermatitis, and dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis, a model for inflammatory bowel disease. Taken together, our data provide confirmation that GLEPP1 plays an important role in controlling chemotaxis of multiple types of leukocytes and that pharmacological inhibition of this phosphatase may have therapeutic use."
https://openalex.org/W2009475973,"Bacteria decode the isoleucine codon AUA using a tRNA species that is posttranscriptionally modified at the wobble position of the anticodon with a lysine-containing cytidine derivative called lysidine. The lysidine modification of tRNAIle2 is an essential identity determinant for proper aminoacylation by isoleucyl tRNA synthetase (IleRS) and codon recognition on the ribosome. The ATP- and lysine-dependent formation of lysidine is catalyzed by tRNAIle-lysidine synthetase. Using the purified recombinant enzyme from Escherichia coli and an in vitro transcribed tRNA substrate, we have confirmed that lysidine modification is both necessary and sufficient to convert tRNAIle2 into a substrate for IleRS. A series of lysine analogs were tested as potential inhibitors during the mechanistic characterization of tRNAIle-lysidine synthetase. Gel electrophoresis revealed that many of these analogs, including some simple alkyl amines, were alternative substrates. Incorporation of these amines into alternative tRNA products was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The availability of tRNAIle2 with differential modifications enabled an exploration of the structural requirements of the anticodon for aminoacylation by methionyl tRNA synthetase and IleRS.

The fidelity of protein synthesis requires precise decoding of the genetic code. It is essential that aminoacyl tRNA synthetases match the appropriate amino acid-tRNA pairs and that the anticodons of charged tRNAs interact with the correct mRNA codons. Posttranscriptional modification of the first, or wobble, position of the tRNA anticodon contributes to the accuracy of the latter process (1Björk G.R. Ericson J.U. Gustafsson C.E. Hagervall T.G.

PCR amplification of the gene was conducted with the following primers: 5′-CACATTAATATGGATTTTAAAGACACGCTCTTAATG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GTCGCTGCAGTTATTTTTGATAGTATTTTTCAACGATTTC-3′ (reverse primer). The PCR product was ligated into the expression vector pET3D-FLAG (Novagen) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The N-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purified using M2-FLAG resin (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The pooled protein peak was further purified and buffer-exchanged on a Superdex 200 column. The mass of the recombinant IleRS protein was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Preparation of E. coli S100 Extract-E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, 3 g, were suspended in 7 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol and lysed in a French pressure cell at 18,000–20,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the soluble proteins in the supernatant were loaded onto a Superdex 200 column. The peak fractions were pooled, and 0.1 volume of 10% streptomycin sulfate was added. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 65% saturation. After collection of the precipitate by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2 and dialyzed against the same buffer at 4 °C overnight in a Slide-A-Lyzer-10K (Pierce). The protein preparation was frozen after the addition of glycerol to 10%. Preparation of tRNAIle2-A template for in vitro transcription was built by putting the tRNA gene behind a T7 promoter (11Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Overlapping oligonucleotides were prepared on an ABI 394 DNA synthesizer to construct a cDNA flanking the E. coli tRNAIle2 sequence with a 5′ T7 RNA polymerase promoter (5′-AATTCCTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCCCCTTAGCTCAGTGGTTAGAGCAGGCGACTCATAATCGCTTGGTCGC-3′) and a 3′ BstNI restriction site (5′-AATTCCTGGTGGCCCCTGCTGGACTTGAACCAGCGACCAAGCGATTATGAGTCGCCTGCTCTAACCACTGAGC-3′). Vector pLDR24 was generated via mutagenesis of pLDR21 (ATCC #87206) to add EcoRI and PstI restriction sites downstream of the tac promoter. The cDNA was cloned into pLDR24, and the sequence was verified. The resulting pLDR24(Ile2) clone was cut with BstNI to generate the transcription template and used without further purification at 50 μg/ml in the Ribomax Large Scale RNA Production System T7 kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After incubation, the synthesis reaction was extracted with phenol:chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and purified on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). Purity and mass were verified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on Tris borate-EDTA urea gels (Invitrogen) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Preparation of C34G-tRNAIle2-Mutagenesis on clone pLDR24(Ile2) was performed via PCR amplification with the Vent and Vent exo– polymerases (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) using the following oligonucleotides 5′-GTGGTTAGAGCAGGCGACTGATAATCGCTTGGTCGCT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCAGCGACCAAGCGATTATCAGTCGCCTGCTCTAACCAC-3′ (reverse primer). The sequence of the pLDR24(G34Ile2) clone was verified, and the vector was digested with BstNI for the preparation of tRNA as above. Assay of TilS Enzymatic Activity-The standard TilS enzymatic assay was performed in a 96-well white polystyrene microplate with 30 μl of a reaction mix comprised of 50 mm TAPS buffer (pH 8.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.5 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 nm E. coli tRNAIle2, 5 μm ATP, 110 nm [3H]lysine (91 Ci/mmol), and 10 nm E. coli TilS enzyme. Samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature before terminating the reaction by the addition of 30 μl of 2.7 mg/ml SPA beads suspended in 175 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.0) with 100 mm NaCl. After 20 min at room temperature to allow tRNA capture, the plate was centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. Radioactivity was measured in a Packard Topcount NXT microplate scintillation counter. Inhibition curves were plotted, and IC50 values were calculated with a 2 parameter fit using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Preparation of tRNA with Lysine Analogs-Reactions were performed in a 75-μl reaction mix consisting of 50 mm TAPS (pH 8.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μm E. coli tRNAIle2, 100 μm ATP, 500 nm E. coli TilS enzyme, and 100 μm lysine or specified analog concentration for 4 h at 37°C and then frozen without further work up until analysis. The amount of unmodified tRNA was assessed by diluting an aliquot of the reaction mixture 1000-fold into a 30-μl reaction mix comprised of 50 mm TAPS buffer (pH 8.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.5 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm ATP, 110 nm [3H]lysine (91 Ci/mmol), and 20 nm E. coli TilS enzyme. Samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature before terminating the reaction by the addition of SPA beads as in the standard assay above. The reactions with lysine analogs were also analyzed by gel electrophoresis using a 15% polyacrylamide Tris borate-EDTA, 8 m urea gel run at 120 V for 3 h and stained with ethidium bromide. Assay of tRNA Synthetases-Assays for IleRS and MetRS activities were performed in 96-well white polystyrene microplates with 30 μl of a reaction mix comprised of 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.3), 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm TCEP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 nm TilS-modified tRNAIle2, 100 μm ATP, 100 nm [3H]amino acid (93 Ci/mmol for isoleucine; 76 Ci/mmol for methionine), and 40 μg/ml partially purified S-100 fraction of E. coli extract or 0.1 nm recombinant B. subtilis IleRS. The enzyme amounts chosen were within the linear response range of the assay to ensure that the measured rates did not reach a plateau. Samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature before terminating the reaction by the addition of 30 μl of 8.3 mg/ml SPA beads suspended in 175 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.0) with 100 mm NaCl. After 10 min at room temperature to allow tRNA capture, the plate was centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. Radioactivity was measured in a Packard Topcount NXT microplate scintillation counter. The reaction catalyzed by TilS has been assayed with a radio-labeled lysine substrate by following the incorporation of acid precipitable radioactivity into tRNA (5Soma A. Ikeuchi Y. Kanemasa S.

To further simplify the procedure and make the TilS reaction amenable to high throughput screening, we applied SPA technology. This approach has been successfully used for aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, which also perform the ATP-dependent coupling of an amino acid to a tRNA (12Macarrón R. Mensah L. Cid C. Carranza C. Benson N. Pope A.J. Díez E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We found polyethyleneimine-coated wheat germ agglutinin type I polyvinyltoluene beads to perform best for the nonspecific capture of total tRNA. The tRNA substrate was prepared by run-off transcription; previous work indicates that the synthetic polynucleotide is nearly equivalent to the native tRNA substrate (10Ikeuchi Y. Soma A. Ote T. Kato J. Sekine Y. Suzuki T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The use of high specific activity tritiated lysine enabled good detection sensitivity using only nm levels of enzyme and tRNA. TilS was found to have an alkaline pH optimum in the range of 8.5–9.5; pH 8.5 was adopted for the standard assay. Kinetic analysis established that the substrate levels were not saturating for the standard assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” Our examination of the enzymatic reactivity of TilS began with analogs of the three normal substrates as potential competitive inhibitors or alternative substrates. Because cytidine-34 is the site of modification in the tRNA substrate, both cytidine and CMP were tested for inhibition. No inhibition was detected up to 1 mm, however, which is not surprising as previous work had shown that binding determinants are located throughout the tRNA substrate, particularly in the anticodon stem-loop and the acceptor stem (10Ikeuchi Y. Soma A. Ote T. Kato J. Sekine Y. Suzuki T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the cited work a C34G-mutated tRNAIle2 was tested as a TilS substrate and found to be inactive. We prepared the C34G-tRNAIle2 and evaluated it as an inhibitor instead of as a substrate; the mutated tRNAIle2 was in fact found to be a potent inhibitor with an IC50 of 85 nm. This result confirms the importance of the structure and sequence beyond cytidine 34 for enzymatic recognition. A series of 12 commercially available analogs of ATP were also examined for inhibition in the standard TilS assay. As summarized in Table 1, five analogs, three with changes in the triphosphate moiety and two with alterations to the purine base, were found to be modest to weak inhibitors. The analogs were also tested as alternate substrates in a variant of the standard assay lacking ATP. Three analogs modified in the purine base were found to support the TilS reaction (Table 2), although their catalytic efficiencies, as determined by Vmax/Km, were at least 10-fold lower than ATP. Four other analogs (N1-methyladenosine-5′-triphosphate, 2-aminoadenosine-5′-triphosphate, 2-amino-6-chloropurineriboside-5′-triphosphate, and 6-chloropurineriboside-5′-triphosphate) were neither substrates nor inhibitors.TABLE 1Inhibition constants for ATP analogs in the TilS reactionATP analogIC50μmBenzimidazoleriboside-5′-triphosphate105 ± 88-Azaadenosine-5′-triphosphate255 ± 60Adenosine-5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate)16 ± 1α,β-Methyleneadenosine-5′-triphosphate35 ± 3β,γ-Methyleneadenosine-5′-triphosphate82 ± 6 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Kinetic constants for ATP and analogs in the TilS reactionNucleotide substrateKmRelative Vmax/KmμmATP1.6 ± 0.5(100)8-Azidoadenosine-5′-triphosphate10.0 ± 2.42.37-Deazaadenosine-5′-triphosphate1.8 ± 0.58.6N6-Methyladenosine-5′-triphosphate21.7 ± 2.74.7 Open table in a new tab A series of commercially available lysine analogs were examined for inhibition in the standard TilS assay. The structures of these compounds and their inhibition constants are listed in Fig. 1 and Table 3. Lysine, 1, itself appears as an inhibitor because of the isotopic dilution of the tritiated lysine in the assay; the IC50 in this case approximates Km and provides a useful reference point for the binding affinity of the other compounds. Alteration of the amino or carboxyl functionalities on the α carbon of lysine resulted in only very weak inhibitors (compounds 5–8). Likewise, shortening the side chain, deleting the ∈ amino group, or substituting a guanidino moiety were also detrimental (compounds 9, 11, and 12). Modifications within the lysine side chain, however, were much better tolerated. Although the hydroxylysine 4 had reduced potency, dehydrolysine 10 and aminoethylserine 3 were very similar to lysine itself. Surprisingly, aminoethylcysteine 2 appeared to have significantly improved binding affinity relative to lysine. The relatively relaxed requirements of the lysine side chain prompted examination of some primary alkyl amines as potential side chain mimics. Although the simple amino acids 16 and 17 were not inhibitors of the TilS reaction, three other amines containing neutral functional groups instead of carboxylates (13–15) retained detectable binding affinity. The potency of N-acetylethylenediamine (13) is surprisingly good considering it completely lacks the binding determinants of the lysine α carbon.TABLE 3Inhibition constants for lysine and the analogs in Fig. 1 in the TilS reactionNo.CompoundIC50R1R2XR30R4μm1LysineaThe apparent inhibition by lysine is the consequence of isotopic dilution of the radiolabeled substrate.0.68 ± 0.04NH3+CO2-CH2HNH3+2Aminoethylcysteine0.045 ± 0.003NH3+CO2-SHNH3+3Aminoethylserine0.40 ± 0.02NH3+CO2-OHNH3+4(5R)-5-Hydroxylysine17.6 ± 0.8NH3+CO2-CH2OHNH3+5Lysinamide620 ± 70NH3+CONH2CH2HNH3+6Cadaverine910 ± 40NH3+HCH2HNH3+7N-α-methyl-lysinebAs described in the “Results,” these samples apparently contained contaminating lysine.1300 ± 120-NCH3H2+CO2-CH2HNH3+86-Aminohexanoic acid>1000-HCO2-CH2HNH3+9Norleucine>1000NH3+CO2-CH2HH104,5-trans-Dehydrolysine2.5 ± 0.111OrnithinebAs described in the “Results,” these samples apparently contained contaminating lysine.700 ± 15012Arginine>100013N-Acetylethylenediamine6.8 ± 0.914Histamine330 ± 2015Ethanolamine1770 ± 15016Glycine>100017β-Alanine>1000a The apparent inhibition by lysine is the consequence of isotopic dilution of the radiolabeled substrate.b As described in the “Results,” these samples apparently contained contaminating lysine. Open table in a new tab The initial assumption was that the compounds in Table 3, other than lysine, were dead-end inhibitors of TilS, i.e. they formed completely nonproductive complexes with the enzyme. It was noted, however, that every compound with measurable inhibitory potency versus the enzyme contained a primary amine and, thus, was potentially a competitive alternate substrate. Because the assay relies on incorporation of radioactive lysine into tRNA, alternative substrates that replace lysine will appear to be inhibitors and require other methods to discern their true character. This question was addressed in several ways. Analogs were incubated at ≥10-fold their IC50 (see Table 4) with high concentrations of ATP, tRNAIle2, and TilS to maximize the modification of the tRNA. An aliquot of each analog reaction was then diluted into a standard assay containing tritiated lysine to assess whether any unmodified tRNAIle2 remained. As recorded in Table 4, complete conversion with most analogs could be inferred from the complete disappearance (≥99%) of the initial substrate; in reactions K and L about a quarter of the residual tRNAIle2 substrate remained. Formation of fully modified tRNA products in reactions B–J could be directly detected by gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2, reactions B–E and G–J clearly produced tRNA species with slower migration than the unmodified substrate. The migration shift was minimal for cadaverine (reaction F), possibly because this reactant uniquely added some positive charge to the polyanionic tRNA in the electrophoresis at pH 8.7, whereas the other reactants made either zwitterionic (reactions B, C, D, E, G) or neutral (reactions H, I, J) additions.TABLE 4Synthesis of alternative tRNA products from TilS reactions with tRNAIle2 and lysine analogsReactionAmine substrateConcentration% Residual unmodified tRNAPredicted tRNA massObserved tRNA massMass errormmANone (control)(100)24,665.524,669.43.9BLysine0.1024,793.724,795.31.6CAminoethylcysteine0.1024,811.724,813.21.5DAminoethylserine0.1024,795.624,796.20.6E(5R)-5-Hydroxylysine0.2124,809.724,811.51.8FCadaverine10124,749.724,752.22.5G4,5-trans-Dehydrolysine0.1124,791.724,793.01.3HEthanolamine20124,708.624,710.01.4IN-Acetylethylenediamine0.1124,748.624,750.11.5JHistamine5124,758.624,759.71.1KN-α-Methyl-lysine202724,807.724,794.9-12.8LOrnithine102224,779.624,794.314.7 Open table in a new tab Finally, the product tRNAs were also analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; each reaction with lysine or an analog was predicted to generate a modified tRNA with a unique molecular weight. As seen in Table 4, tRNA products with the expected masses were indeed found in reactions A–J. In reactions K and L, however, the molecular weights of the products did not match the predictions and instead matched the product of reaction B which used lysine as substrate. This indicates that low level lysine contamination in the N-α-methyl lysine and ornithine (on the order of 0.1%) accounted for the modified tRNAs formed in reactions K and L, respectively. Trace lysine at such a level likely accounts for all of the potency of these two compounds as (apparent) inhibitors in Table 3 as well. For the eight other lysine analogs, however, the evidence is unambiguous that TilS is capable of accepting alternative substrates for modification of tRNAIle2. Nucleotides in the anticodon loop are among the common identity elements that define specific recognition of tRNAs by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. It has previously been reported that the lysidine modification of cytidine 34 in the anticodon of tRNAIle2 is an absolute determinant for switching recognition from MetRS to IleRS (3Muramatsu T. Nishikawa K. Nemoto F. Kuchino Y. Nishimura S. Miyazawa T. Yokoyama S. Nature. 1988; 336: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). We sought to verify and extend these observations using both partially purified native E. coli and purified recombinant B. subtilis tRNA synthetase enzymes. The availability of differentially TilS-modified tRNAIle2 molecules enabled us to explore in greater detail the specificity determinants of the anticodon for aminoacylation. After appropriate assay conditions were established for coupling of methionine and isoleucine to their respective tRNAs, the tRNAs from TilS reaction mixtures A–J in Table 4 were each tested as a substrate for aminoacylation by MetRS or IleRS. The results are presented in Table 5. Consistent with literature precedent, the unmodified tRNAIle2 (reaction A) showed measurable activity as a substrate for the native E. coli MetRS, although its reaction rate was slower than authentic tRNAMet. Also as expected, aminoacylation with methionine was undetectable after TilS modification of tRNAIle2 with lysine (reaction B). Table 5 newly reveals that all of the alternative modifications made to tRNAIle2 in TilS reactions C–J were equally effective at creating negative determinants for MetRS recognition.TABLE 5Evaluation of alternatively TilS-modified tRNAs from Table 4 as substrates for tRNA synthetasestRNA substrate (amine modifier)Relative aminoacylation rateaThe 100% reference corresponds to 3240, 2210, or 4600 net cpm for E. coli MetRS, E. coli IleRS, or B. subtilis IleRS, respectively, measured after a 2-h assay as described under “Experimental Procedures”.E. coli MetRSE. coli IleRSB. subtilis IleRS%tRNAMet(100)732Reaction A (control)2320Reaction B (lysine)0(100)(100)Reaction C (aminoethylcysteine)1104127Reaction D (aminoethylserine)04495Reaction E ((5R)-5-hydroxylysine)423130Reaction F (cadaverine)1356133Reaction G (4,5-trans-dehydrolysine)219105Reactio"
https://openalex.org/W2050466458,"Pdi1p (protein-disulfide isomerase) is a folding assistant of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that catalyzes disulfide formation and the isomerization of incorrect disulfides. Its disulfide forming activity is its essential function in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</i> A truncation mutant (Pdi1a′) that is competent in disulfide formation but deficient in catalyzing isomerization has only a small effect on growth, although the maturation of isomerase-requiring substrates (carboxypeptidase Y) is impaired (Xiao, R., Wilkinson, B., Solovyov, A., Winther, J. R., Holmgren, A., Lundstrom-Ljung, J., and Gilbert, H. F. (2004) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 279, 49780–49786). We show here that there are multiple ways to compensate for defects in disulfide formation and isomerization in the ER. Genes of the unfolded protein response are induced, and deletions of the nonessential <i>IRE1</i> or <i>HAC1</i> genes are synthetically lethal. Diploid synthetic lethality analysis by microarray (dSLAM) using PDIa′ and a temperature-sensitive mutant of PDIa′ as query mutations reveals a group of 130 synthetically lethal genes. Only 10 of these correspond to genes clearly associated with the unfolded protein response. More than half are involved in vesicle traffic, not only out of and into the ER but anterograde and retrograde traffic from most cellular compartments. This suggests that defects in protein maturation in one intracellular compartment may be compensated for by adjusting vesicular traffic patterns throughout the cell."

Methodology/Principal Findings We profiled six histone modifications alongside RNA polymerase II (PolII) and CTCF in two cell lines, HeLa S3 and NTERA-2 clone D1 (NT2/D1), by chromatin immunoprecipitation using an in-house spotted DNA array, constructed with 1.8 kb overlapping plasmid clones. In both cells, more than 90% of transcription start sites (TSSs) of expressed genes showed enrichments with PolII, di-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me2), tri-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) or acetylated H3 (H3Ac), whereas mono-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me1) signals did not correlate with expression. No TSSs were enriched with tri-methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) in HeLa S3, while eight TSSs (4 expressed) showed enrichments in NT2/D1. We have also located several CTCF binding sites that are potential insulator elements. Conclusions/Significance In summary, we annotated a number of putative regulatory elements in 20q13.12 and went on to verify experimentally a subset of them using dual luciferase reporter assays. Correlating this data to sequence variation can aid identification of disease causing variants."
