https://openalex.org/W2011684044,"A host of diverse stress techniques was applied to a monoclonal antibody (IgG2) to yield protein particles with varying attributes and morphologies. Aggregated solutions were evaluated for percent aggregation, particle counts, size distribution, morphology, changes in secondary and tertiary structure, surface hydrophobicity, metal content, and reversibility. Chemical modifications were also identified in a separate report (Luo, Q., Joubert, M. K., Stevenson, R., Narhi, L. O., and Wypych, J. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 25134–25144). Aggregates were categorized into seven discrete classes, based on the traits described. Several additional molecules (from the IgG1 and IgG2 subtypes as well as intravenous IgG) were stressed and found to be defined with the same classification system. The mechanism of protein aggregation and the type of aggregate formed depends on the nature of the stress applied. Different IgG molecules appear to aggregate by a similar mechanism under the same applied stress. Aggregates created by harsh mechanical stress showed the largest number of subvisible particles, and the class generated by thermal stress displayed the largest number of visible particles. Most classes showed a disruption of the higher order structure, with the degree of disorder depending on the stress process. Particles in all classes (except thermal stress) were at least partially reversible upon dilution in pH 5 buffer. High copper content was detected in isolated metal-catalyzed aggregates, a stress previously shown to produce immunogenic aggregates. In conclusion, protein aggregates can be a very heterogeneous population, whose qualities are the result of the type of stress that was experienced.

Aggregation of biotherapeutics is a key issue for the advancement of marketed products (1Kessler M. Goldsmith D. Schellekens H. Nephrol. Dial.

The characterization of protein aggregates as caused by assorted kinds of stress is an essential step to understanding the features, underlying causes, and potential biological effects of these particles (4Kiese S.

The control of particulation is necessary for ensuring the safety and efficacy of protein drug products (5Demeule B. Gurny R. Arvinte T. Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 2006; 62: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Much of our current understanding of the immunogenicity of aggregates comes from studies on vaccine development and the immunogenicity of protein assemblies. Regulatory agencies are concerned about the safety impact of submicron and micron protein particles (2Seaver S. Bioquality. 2008; 13: 3-4Google Scholar, 6Rosenberg A. 13th Symposium of the Interface of Regulatory and Analytical Sciences for Biotechnology Health Products.

Protein aggregates may present self-antigens that break B-cell tolerance (stimulating B-cells without T-cell help) to produce neutralizing antibodies (11Rosenberg A.S.

Unlike rigid arrays, protein aggregates, however, appear to be irregular and amorphous and thus unlikely to display repeating antigenic motifs (13Huang C.T. Sharma D. Oma P. Krishnamurthy R. J. Pharm. Sci. 2009; 98: 3058-3071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Also, subvisible particles, most of them likely to be aggregates of the biotherapeutic, are found in marketed products with no evidence of safety risks (14Singh S.K. Afonina N. Awwad M. Bechtold-Peters K. Blue J.T. Chou D. Cromwell M. Krause H.J. Mahler H.C. Meyer B.K. Narhi L. Nesta D.P. Spitznagel T. J. Pharm.

Immunogenicity assays have shown that the nature of the aggregate and the type of protein are critical for eliciting an immune response as seen in several cases, IFN-α (9Braun A. Kwee L.

Metal-catalyzed aggregates of IFN-α showed the highest level of response and were able to break the tolerance of transgenic mice (9Braun A. Kwee L. Labow M.A. Alsenz J. Pharm.

Biopharm. 2006; 62: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a prominent category of biopharmaceutical medication, would help shed light on the potential health issues surrounding this type of therapeutic. Although the true propensity of aggregates to trigger immune responses will only be revealed upon clinical analysis, detailed studies describing these distinct sets of IgG aggregates will provide needed information for understanding the effect of these specific subsets of antibody aggregates on the immune system. Biotherapeutics for clinical trials must be fully investigated and accurately quantitated for particulates.

USP limits are numerical, do not reflect the quality of the product, and show no differentiation between different types of aggregates.

The propensity of proteins to aggregate is an inherent and problematic property of all proteins (15Maas C. Hermeling S. Bouma B. Jiskoot W. Gebbink M.F. J. Biol.

J. 2009; 96: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Aggregation of protein particles can occur under a wide range of conditions (26Chen S. Lau H. Brodsky Y. Kleemann G.R. Latypov R.F. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Fesinmeyer R.M. Hogan S. Saluja A. Brych S.R. Kras E. Narhi L.O. Brems D.N. Gokarn Y.R. Pharm. Res. 2009; 26: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The control of protein stability during biotherapeutic drug production is a challenging task for many pharmaceutical companies. Biopharmaceutical products can aggregate during any stage of the manufacturing process, including fermentation, purification, formulation, filling, storage, shipping, handling, and administration. Protein aggregation can be accelerated by various external factors such as heating, freezing-thawing, mechanical stress, chemical treatment, cross-linking, formulation changes, storage, and exposure to extractables/leachables (28Hari S.B.

Sci. 2009; 98: 2909-2934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Different stress treatments can generate aggregates with widely varying properties (31Hawe A. Kasper J.C. Friess W. Jiskoot W. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2009; 38: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Stressed samples can potentially have different particle size distributions, particle morphology, chemical modifications, reversibility, percent aggregation, conformations (native-like versus unfolded), and particle surface hydrophobicity. Full characterization of different aggregate types is essential to understanding the origin of aggregate formation and the dependence of potential biological impact on specific traits. No single analytical technique is sufficient for assessing and monitoring aggregates (30Mahler H.C. Friess W. Grauschopf U. Kiese S. J. Pharm. Sci. 2009; 98: 2909-2934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In this work we used one IgG1 protein, two IgG2 proteins, and intravenous IgG (containing all IgG subtypes) as representative antibody biotherapeutics. A collection of protein aggregates was prepared by using a wide range of stress approaches. A host of analytical techniques was used to differentiate and compare aggregates, including size-exclusion chromatography, light obscuration, nanoparticle tracking analysis, micro-flow imaging, FTIR, and UV-visible spectroscopies, fluorescence, hydrophobic dye binding, and ICP-MS. These techniques were selected as they are effective at probing the desired biophysical attributes; however, other convenient methods that are equally informative could be substituted to obtain the desired information. Aggregate groups were then classified based on the properties identified by these analyses. Future studies that test a wider array of molecules will be essential for establishing the extent of suitability of the classification scheme. Purified human IgG2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb1 and mAb2) and a mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb4) were supplied by an Amgen process development group as high concentration solutions. Human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb3) and intravenous human IgG (IVIG, containing a mixture of IgG antibodies from all subtypes), are commercially available as highly purified solutions used therapeutically. The protein solutions were diluted to both 1 and 10 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate, pH 5.0 (except for mAb3 where, according to the manufacturer's instructions, water was used for all subsequent steps), and then stressed to make aggregated solutions at concentrations needed by the various assays. The diluted samples before stress treatment were used as negative controls (untreated). Aggregates were synthesized to resemble those that can occur during the storage, manufacture, shipping, and administration of biotherapeutics. 11 different stress conditions were used as described below. To imitate aggregation during storage below freezing temperatures, the protein solution was subjected to 10 cycles of either placement in a freezer at −80 °C followed by thawing in a 37 °C bath (ft-slow) or flash freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by thawing in a 37 °C bath (ft-fast). To accelerate aggregation occurring during long term storage at 4–8 °C, the protein solution was incubated in a 37 °C bath for 19 months (store). For aggregates that were made upon the change in pH, the high concentration protein solution was diluted to 1 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate at varying pH values (pH 3.5, 4.3, and 8.5) and 10 mm Tris, pH 11, and it was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Aggregates were created by simulated mechanical stress to reproduce those caused during the manufacturing and shipping of therapeutic antibodies. One condition used was pipetting; the protein solution was pumped through a disposable pipette tip (Fisher) 100 times (pipette). To apply agitation stress, 0.5 ml of sample was subjected to shaking at 500 rounds/min in a 3-ml glass vial capped and placed vertically in a VWR Scientific (West Chester, PA) analog orbital shaker (model OS-500) as described previously (27Fesinmeyer R.M. Hogan S. Saluja A. Brych S.R. Kras E. Narhi L.O. Brems D.N. Gokarn Y.R. Pharm. Res. 2009; 26: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), at either 4 °C for 7 days in the absence (agitate-4C-so−) or presence of 1.5% (w/v) silicone oil (agitate-4C-so+) or 22 °C for 3 days in the absence (agitate-so−) or presence of silicone oil (agitate-so+). A 3% (w/v) stock solution of silicone oil in 10 mm acetate, pH 5.0, was used that had been previously pumped 10 times through an 18-gauge × 1.5-inch needle (VWR Scientific) attached to a 3-ml disposable syringe (Fisher) to make an emulsion. For stirring stress, 2 ml of the protein sample was stirred with a 6 × 6-mm Teflon stirrer bar at ∼700 rpm, creating a vortex, in a 5-ml glass vial capped and placed vertically on a magnetic stir plate over 20 h (stir-20h) or 3 days (stir-3d). To replicate aggregates that can be formed during the administration of biotherapeutics via syringes, two different approaches were taken. The protein samples were pumped 50 times through a disposable 18-gauge × 1.5-inch needle (VWR Scientific) attached to either a Daikyo Crystal Zenith cyclic olefin copolymer syringe that was silicone oil-free (West Pharmaceutical Services) (syringe-so−) or through a 3-ml disposable polyethylene syringe containing silicone oil (Fisher) (syringe-so+). The plastic cyclic olefin copolymer syringe was made of material commonly found in commercially available plastic pre-filled syringes (32Eakins M.N. Pharmaceutical Outsourcing. 2010; 11: 10-14Google Scholar, 33Lahendro B. OnDrugDelivery. 2008; : 24-26Google Scholar), and the disposable polyethylene syringe was the device commonly used for administration during clinical drug development. These two syringes differ in several aspects, including material composition and the presence of silicone oil. To model aggregates that become chemically modified during manufacturing, the protein solution was exposed to various chemical treatments. Oxidation of proteins during manufacturing was imitated by adding 0.1% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to the protein, incubating for 20 h at 37 °C, and quenching with 12 mg/ml methionine (H2O2), as similarly described by other groups (16Hermeling S. Aranha L. Damen J.M. Slijper M. Schellekens H. Crommelin D.J. Jiskoot W. Pharm. Res. 2005; 22: 1997-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34European Pharmacopeia 5.0 Interferon alpha 2b. 2004; Vol. 2 (European Pharmacopeia): 1812-1815Google Scholar). Metal-catalyzed oxidation was also employed. This condition was chosen because much of the literature on the immunogenicity of aggregates was obtained using aggregates generated by this technique. Protein solutions were oxidized with 5 mm CuSO4 and 4 mm ascorbic acid overnight at 37 °C and quenched with 5 mm EDTA (metal), similar to that described previously (16Hermeling S. Aranha L. Damen J.M. Slijper M. Schellekens H. Crommelin D.J. Jiskoot W. Pharm. Res. 2005; 22: 1997-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Hermeling S. Schellekens H. Maas C. Gebbink M.F. Crommelin D.J. Jiskoot W. J. Pharm. Sci. 2006; 95: 1084-1096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Lower copper concentrations were also tested, and similar results were obtained. Chemically cross-linked aggregates were generated as well. Although these conditions do not emulate any conditions encountered during manufacturing, these aggregates are good controls as they are irreversible once generated. Samples were dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES, pH 5.5, then incubated for 1 h with 0.8 mg/ml 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride and 1.2 mg/ml N-hydroxysuccinimide (Pierce), and quenched with 10 mm ethanolamine (xlink). After quenching, the H2O2, metal, and xlink samples were dialyzed at a volume ratio of 1:100 into 10 mm acetate, pH 5.0, in two steps for 2 h and then overnight. Thermal stress was used to study aggregate that can be generated due to unfolding of the protein, reflecting the conformational stability of the mAb. As a condition of extreme stress, the protein solution was incubated in a 90 °C bath overnight (90C), well above the thermal transition of the Fc and Fab domains. As a less extreme stress condition, the protein solution was diluted to 1 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate, pH 8.5, followed by incubation in a 65 °C bath for 1 h (65C/pH 8.5). 65 °C was chosen as this is below the melting temperature (Tm) of the protein (the Tm of mAb1 in 10 mm acetate, pH 5, was determined by differential scanning calorimetry to be 74.2 °C). Exposing the protein to 65 °C or pH 8.5 separately produced a minimal amount of aggregation. However, in combination, the protein was destabilized enough to aggregate substantially. To estimate the percent of original protein present as aggregates, stressed samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm to pellet the insoluble material, and the protein concentration before and after centrifugation was determined by measuring the A280 on a Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). For samples that contained insoluble aggregates (aggregates that could be pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm), an aliquot of each solution was first dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride before measuring the A280. A denaturing agent was used to dissolve protein aggregates as they can interfere with the absorbance reading by quenching the signal or scattering light. The percentage of aggregation was calculated from the difference in protein concentration before and after centrifugation, taken as a percentage of the protein originally present. The average of 3–4 different sample preparations is reported, where the error is the standard deviation. Resolubilization was confirmed by comparing the absorbance of the unfractionated sample before and after stress treatment to ensure that the readings were equal. For all experiments where the supernatant and pellet components were separated after stress treatment, the following protocol was used. Total stressed samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm, and the supernatant fraction was removed for analysis. The tube containing pelleted aggregates was inverted and lightly tapped to remove residual supernatant, followed by gentle resuspending of the pellet in 100 μl of 10 mm acetate, pH 5.0 (pellet fraction). The protein concentration of the total sample, supernatant, and pellet fractions was then determined as above. SE-HPLC was carried out on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a binary pump and equipped with a UV detector. 100 μl of the supernatant of each stressed sample prepared at 1 mg/ml was injected onto a Tosoh Bioscience TSK-Gel G3000SWxl (7.8 × 300 mm, 5-μm particle size) column operated at 25 °C, and the absorbance at 280 nm was recorded. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min with a total elution time of 35 min. The mobile phase contained 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 250 mm sodium chloride. Data acquisition and peak area integration were achieved by the Agilent ChemStation software version B.04.02. The main peak corresponded to the monomeric peak of the untreated sample. High molecular weight (HMW) peaks included everything in the range between the excluded volume and the start of the main peak, and low molecular weight (LMW) peaks included all peaks up to ∼6 min after the main peak (buffer peak excluded). The integrated area of the Main, HMW, and LMW peaks were taken as a percentage of the total integrated peak area and called % Main, % HMW, and % LMW, respectively. Particle counting and size distribution were achieved via the light obscuration method described in USP and adapted for a smaller sample volume. An HIAC/Royco liquid particle counter model 9703 with an HRLD-150 sensor and the software PharmSpec (HACH Ultra Analytics, Grants Pass, OR) were used. Particle-free water was washed through the system before each sample analysis to provide for a clean base line. Total stressed samples made at 1 mg/ml were diluted (20–440×) in 10 mm acetate, pH 5.0, to keep the particle counts within the detection limits of the instrument. Samples were degassed in a vacuum chamber at 75 torr for at least 1 h, gently swirled, and then measured four times at a volume of 0.5 ml per injection. The first run was discarded, and the last three runs were averaged. Particles were counted as differential counts per 0.5 ml in size ranges of 2–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–25, and 25–150 μm. Final particle counts were adjusted based on the initial dilution factor. Nanoparticle detection was performed on a NanoSight LM10-HSB (NanoSight, Amesbury, UK), containing a high sensitivity EMCCD camera and 405 nm blue laser. Total stressed samples made at 1 mg/ml were diluted 10-fold in 10 mm acetate, pH 5.0, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min to reduce interference from very large aggregates. Samples were injected in the sample chamber using silicone oil-free syringes, and measurements were taken at room temperature with an assumed viscosity of 0.95 centipoise. Videos were recorded for 10 s with manual shutter and gain adjustments. The NanoSight NTA version 2.0 Build 0252 software was used for data analysis. Final counts were adjusted based on the dilution factor. Particle images were captured on a liquid-borne particle MFI System DPA4100 (Brightwell Technologies, Inc.). MFI captures images as the sample passes through a flow cell and then analyzes each particle's image to gain specific information about the properties of the particle (13Huang C.T. Sharma D. Oma P. Krishnamurthy R. J. Pharm. Sci. 2009; 98: 3058-3071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Particle-free water was flushed through the system before each sample analysis to provide for a clean base line. Total stressed samples made at 1 mg/ml were diluted (20–440×) in 10 mm acetate, pH 5.0 (in the same manner as described under “Light Obscuration”). Samples were degassed in a vacuum chamber at 75 torr for at least 1 h, gently swirled, and then drawn from a 1-ml pipette tip into the flow cell using a peristaltic pump. 0.8 ml was loaded at a time; the first 0.3 ml was discarded and only the following 0.5 ml was analyzed. 500 images were collected per sample and processed by the system software to extract each particle and its characteristics, including size, shape, transparency, and an individual image. An array of typical particle images from each sample and the longest dimension (feret diameter) were used for further comparison. FTIR spectra of the untreated and stressed protein were obtained with the Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrophotometer with the attenuated total reflectance device and OPUS spectroscopy software version 6.5 (Bruker Optics). Stressed samples prepared at 10 mg/ml were used for analysis. 20 μl of the total sample, supernatant, and pellet fractions (which created a slurry upon resolubilization because of the higher protein concentration used) was placed directly in the attenuated total reflectance cell for 270 scans at a resolution of 2 cm−1. To improve contact between the aggregate in the pellet fraction and the cell surface, standing liquid was removed from the cell, and the remaining thin layer of particles was air-dried for 20 s before taking the spectrum. A protein-free blank control was prepared for each stressed sample, where buffer was stress-treated in a manner identical to the protein. The spectrum of the relevant control was subtracted from the stressed protein spectrum for each sample, to minimize differences in solutions.

IntroductionPluripotent and differentiated cell fates are determined at least in part by tissue-specific transcription factors that impose a concrete genetic program (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18471) Google Scholar). In addition to coding RNAs, noncoding RNAs (2Bartel D.P. Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15577) Google Scholar) are an integral part of the genetic programs that specify cell fate, regulating, for example, the expression of key cell-specific transcription factors (3Tay Y. Zhang J. Thomson A.M. Lim B. Rigoutsos I. Nature. 2008; 455: 1124-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar) and chromatin stability (4van Wolfswinkel J.C. Ketting R.F. J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 1825-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and therefore cell-specific properties. miRNAs 4The abbreviations used are: miRNA, microRNA; ESC, embryonic stem cell; iPSC, induced pluripotent stem cell; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; TGFβR, TGFβ receptor; qRT, quantitative RT; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; MET, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. are 21–23-nucleotide-long noncoding RNAs that, by inducing degradation and/or preventing translation of target mRNAs (2Bartel D.P. Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15577) Google Scholar), modulate a plethora of cell functions, including those related to ESC self-renewal/differentiation (5Xu N. Papagiannakopoulos T. Pan G. Thomson J.A. Kosik K.S. Cell. 2009; 137: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) and cell cycle progression (6Wang Y. Baskerville S. Shenoy A. Babiarz J.E. Baehner L. Blelloch R. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In this context, it is not only expected that miRNAs can enhance reprogramming but also tempting to speculate that, in the right combination, they might be able to reset somatic cells into iPSCs without added factors. Blelloch and co-workers (7Judson R.L. Babiarz J.E. Venere M. Blelloch R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) observed that, in the original mixture devised by Takahashi and Yamanaka (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18471) Google Scholar), c-Myc can be substituted by components of the miR-290 cluster or by miR-302d. Elimination of c-Myc is desirable because it reduces tumor formation but has a negative effect on reprogramming. However, use of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides involves repeated transfection, and this implies a transient effect, toxicity, and an inability to pool large numbers of miRNAs without reducing their concentration beyond an optimal threshold. The latter is a concern because many ESC-specific miRNAs reside clustered within the same genome locus, and one could argue that delivering some or all these miRNA clusters together should be optimal for producing iPSCs. In this regard, we demonstrate herein that stable overexpression of entire endogenous miRNA clusters can potently improve reprogramming and be an effective tool for mechanistic analysis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe chose 3 miRNA clusters with high relative expression in ESCs compared with somatic cells based on our recent work (9Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W. Chen J. Li F. Zhuang Q. Qin B. Xu J. Li W. Yang J. Gan Y. Qin D. Feng S. Song H. Yang D. Zhang B. Zeng L. Lai L. Esteban M.A. Pei D. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) and insights from other studies (10Marson A. Levine S.S. Cole M.F. Frampton G.M. Brambrink T. Johnstone S. Guenther M.G. Johnston W.K. Wernig M. Newman J. Calabrese J.M. Dennis L.M. Volkert T.L. Gupta S. Love J. Hannett N. Sharp P.A. Bartel D.P. Jaenisch R. Young R.A.

RNA. 2008; 14: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). miR-200b–429, miR-106a–363, and miR-302–367 are hereafter referred to as clusters A, B, and C, respectively (Fig. 1A). Cluster A contains miR-200b/a and -429, which are associated with maintenance of an epithelial phenotype (12Gregory P.A. Bert A.G. Paterson E.L. Barry S.C. Tsykin A. Farshid G. Vadas M.A. Khew-Goodall Y. Goodall G.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar). Cluster B contains miR-106a, -18b, -20b, -19b-2, -92a-2, and -363. Cluster C contains miR-302b/c/a/d and -367. miR-106a and -20b and miR-302 members, as well as constituents of the miR-294 cluster, belong to the so-called ESC cycle-regulating group of miRNAs responsible for modulating the unique characteristics of the ESC cycle (6Wang Y. Baskerville S. Shenoy A. Babiarz J.E. Baehner L. Blelloch R. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). miR-106a/b and several miRNA components in cluster C display similarity in the seed region that helps determine target specificity (2Bartel D.P. Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15577) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Members of the miR-294 cluster share this similarity as well, suggesting that the 3 clusters may act in tandem to impose changes in the ESC program. First, we verified high expression of each individual endogenous miRNA of the 3 clusters in mouse ESCs compared with fibroblasts by qRT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S2A). We then amplified their genomic loci by PCR and separately cloned them into a retroviral vector commonly used to induce reprogramming (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18471) Google Scholar, 8Esteban M.A. Wang T. Qin B. Yang J. Qin D. Cai J. Li W. Weng Z. Chen J. Ni S. Chen K. Li Y. Liu X.

Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). We envisaged that a fragment containing not only the miRNA precursor sequence but also tens of flanking bases would result in effective cleavage of the large primary miRNA product into mature miRNAs. Increased expression of each individual component was validated by qRT-PCR after delivery into fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. S3). The -fold increase in miR-106a, -20b, 19b, -92a, -367, and -429 was less remarkable possibly due to higher basal expression in fibroblasts relative to miR-302 components (supplemental Fig. S2B). Next, we overexpressed the 3 miRNA clusters together with Sox2, Klf4, and Oct4, with or without c-Myc, using donor fibroblasts that bear a transgenic oct4 reporter driving GFP expression as an indication of full reprogramming (8Esteban M.A. Wang T. Qin B. Yang J. Qin D. Cai J. Li W. Weng Z. Chen J. Ni S. Chen K. Li Y. Liu X. Xu J. Zhang S. Li F. He W. Labuda K. Song Y. Peterbauer A. Wolbank S. Redl H. Zhong M. Cai D. Zeng L. Pei D.

Cluster B and, more remarkably, cluster C significantly enhanced the number of GFP+ colonies counted at day 11 post-infection with 4 factors or day 15 with 3 factors (Fig. 1, B and C), whereas cluster A did not have any effect. The improvement by clusters B and C was more evident with 3 factors than with 4, and in both cases, we observed strong synergy with vitamin C, which is known to improve reprogramming (Fig. 1C) (8Esteban M.A. Wang T. Qin B. Yang J. Qin D. Cai J. Li W. Weng Z. Chen J. Ni S. Chen K. Li Y. Liu X. Xu J. Zhang S. Li F. He W. Labuda K. Song Y. Peterbauer A. Wolbank S. Redl H. Zhong M. Cai D. Zeng L. Pei D. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). The increase in GFP+ colonies and the accelerated time course with 3 factors and cluster C is notable as, under normal experimental conditions, only a few colonies emerge as late as day 20. We also noticed that most (if not all) of the colonies produced with 3 factors and cluster B or C had ESC-like morphology and were GFP+ rather than representing incompletely reprogrammed cells. GFP+ colonies could be readily picked and expanded and were pluripotent using standard procedures, including the formation of chimeric mice with germ-line transmission (Fig. 1, D and E, and supplemental Fig. S4). These miRNAs had integrated into the iPSC genome, but their expression was mostly silenced, as with the exogenous transcription factors (Fig. 1, F and G). Therefore, stable overexpression of endogenous miRNA clusters can greatly improve the reprogramming of somatic cells.Next, we tried to understand the differential effect of miRNA clusters B and C on 3 versus 4 factors. We hypothesized that the 2-factor combinations may mediate differential activation of endogenous miRNA clusters B and C. qRT-PCR showed indeed that miR-106a, -19b, -20b, and -92a were significantly up-regulated by 4 factors compared with 3 and by individual overexpression of c-Myc (Fig. 2A). In contrast, miR-302b/d were induced by 4 factors but not by c-Myc alone (Fig. 2A). The latter result suggests an indirect effect of the 4 factors or a single factor-mediated effect that needs prior opening of the chromatin through the combined action of all factors. Other components of clusters B and C did not show any noticeable change (data not shown). We then analyzed the relative contribution of each miRNA by overexpressing them individually or in combination, also using retroviral vectors and adding vitamin C to magnify differences. In the context of cluster B, only miR-106a and -20b could improve the 3-factor basal efficiency (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the combination of miR-302b/c/a/d was almost as potent as intact cluster C, whereas miR-367 alone had no effect (Fig. 2B). The choice for this division is that all miR-302 components are rather similar, and thus, one would expect redundancy. The relative contributions of endogenous miR-106a and -20b in cluster B and the miR-302 family in cluster C were demonstrated by transient transfection of specific miRNA antagonists (antagomirs) (13Krützfeldt J. Rajewsky N. Braich R. Rajeev K.G. Tuschl T. Manoharan M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2005; 438: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (3325) Google Scholar) in fibroblasts transduced with 3 factors plus miRNA cluster B or C (Fig. 2C); these experiments were performed also with added vitamin C. These results show that c-Myc directly and indirectly up-regulated key miRNAs to overcome the low basal reprogramming efficiency of 3 factors compared with 4.FIGURE 2Effect of c-Myc endogenous miRNA clusters B and C and identification of key miRNA components. A, MEFs were infected with empty vector retroviruses (control), individual factors, and 3 or 4 factors. The control empty vector for the 3- or 4-factor infections was adjusted to the total number of viruses. qRT-PCR results for a representative experiment of three are shown; p values for c-Myc and 4 factors refer to the empty vector or 3 factors, respectively. *, p < 0.05.

C, the number of GFP+ colonies was counted after transient transfection of the indicated antagomirs in MEFs infected with 3 factors plus miRNA cluster B or C. Representative experiments (of three for each set) are shown. Blank, transfection reagent only; Negative control, sequence that has no match in the mouse.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also investigated how miRNA clusters B and C enhance reprogramming mechanistically. We performed DNA microarray analysis of a time course experiment in which 3 factors and clusters B and C or a control empty vector were overexpressed, and the analysis yielded a large number of differentially expressed genes (supplemental Table S2). These differentially expressed genes did not group into pathways with an obvious connection to reprogramming (supplemental Table S3). However, among those that changed at an early time point (day 4), especially in cluster C, we found genes involved in three relevant processes: the cell cycle, epigenetic modulation, and EMT-MET (e.g. the transcriptional repressor Zeb1, E-cadherin, and occludin) (supplemental Table S4). At later time points, we observed also an increase in Esrrb, Nanog, and UTF1 (supplemental Table S4), which have been implicated in reprogramming. The effect of clusters B and C on cell cycle-related genes is not surprising, as some of the constituent miRNAs belong to the ESC cycle-regulating group (6Wang Y. Baskerville S. Shenoy A. Babiarz J.E. Baehner L. Blelloch R. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We (9Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W. Chen J. Li F. Zhuang Q. Qin B. Xu J. Li W. Yang J. Gan Y. Qin D. Feng S. Song H. Yang D. Zhang B. Zeng L. Lai L. Esteban M.A. Pei D. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) and others (14Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Golipour A. David L. Sung H.K. Beyer T.A. Datti A. Woltjen K. Nagy A. Wrana J.L. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 64-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) showed recently that the process of MET (driven mainly by Klf4) coupled to down-regulation of EMT-related genes and TGFβ signaling (mediated mainly by c-Myc) is instrumental for the reprogramming of fibroblasts into iPSCs, but the precise molecular mechanism is not well understood yet. We hypothesized that miRNA cluster C enhances reprogramming at least in part through a MET-related mechanism. First, we explored a putative link between cluster C and MET in silico and found that TGFβR2 is indeed a potential target mRNA of miR-302 members as predicted with the program TargetScan (2Bartel D.P. Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15577) Google Scholar). TGFβR2 binds TGFβ cytokines and induces EMT through phosphorylation of TGFβR1 and activation of the Smad signaling pathway (9Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W. Chen J. Li F. Zhuang Q. Qin B. Xu J. Li W. Yang J. Gan Y. Qin D. Feng S. Song H. Yang D. Zhang B. Zeng L. Lai L. Esteban M.A. Pei D. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Using a reporter-based assay, we also detected that miR-302d, as a representative component of cluster C, bound to and repressed the 3′-UTR of TGFβR2 (Fig. 3, A and B). This was alleviated by mutating the miRNA-binding site in the 3′-UTR (Fig. 3B). In addition, overexpression of cluster C down-regulated TGFβR2 protein in fibroblasts (Fig. 3C). TargetScan predicted also that miR-20b and -106a can target TGFβR2, but we did not observe protein down-regulation after overexpressing cluster B in MEFs (Fig. 3C). During the time course of reprogramming with 3 factors, cluster C could increase E-cadherin expression compared with cluster B or the control, as assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 3, D and E). Interestingly, cluster A could also increase E-cadherin mRNA and protein (Fig. 3, D and E). Immunofluorescence microscopy for E-cadherin and its cytoplasmic partner β-catenin validated that both clusters C and A induce MET (Fig. 3F). E-cadherin induction by clusters A and C was comparable at early time points, but later on, the increase was more marked with cluster C (Fig. 3, D and F). On the other hand, overexpression of a constitutively active form of TGFβR1 (more potently) or TGFβR2 (9Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W. Chen J. Li F. Zhuang Q. Qin B. Xu J. Li W. Yang J. Gan Y. Qin D. Feng S. Song H. Yang D. Zhang B. Zeng L. Lai L. Esteban M.A. Pei D. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 51-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) attenuated the accelerated MET changes observed with miRNA cluster C and 3 factors (data not shown) and reduced the number of GFP+ colonies (Fig. 3G). This demonstrates that cluster C enhances reprogramming at least in part by targeting TGFβR2. While our manuscript was in preparation, Li et al. (15Li Z. Yang C.S. Nakashima K. Rana T.M. EMBO J. 2011; 30: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) showed that miR-106a/b enhance mouse reprogramming through down-regulation of p21 and TGFβR2. The lack of an obvious effect of cluster B (containing miR-106a) in repressing TGFβR2 in MEFs and in inducing MET during reprogramming in our model may be explained by differences in the delivery method. miR-106a/b and -302 components display similarity in the seed region, but their sequences are not identical (supplemental Fig. S1), which might determine a different affinity for targeting TGFβR2. In this regard, oligonucleotide transfection can likely achieve higher single miRNA expression levels than retroviral delivery of an entire miRNA cluster, thus bypassing potential differences in relative specificity. The lack of effect on colony formation of miRNA cluster A is also puzzling and contrasts with the data of Samavarchi-Tehrani et al. (14Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Golipour A. David L. Sung H.K. Beyer T.A. Datti A. Woltjen K. Nagy A. Wrana J.L. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 64-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that cluster A seems to improve MET at the start, but the final number of reprogrammed colonies remains unaffected. Samavarchi-Tehrani et al. performed transient transfection, whereas in our work, high expression levels remained constant. In this regard, a recent study by Wellner et al. demonstrated (16Wellner U. Schubert J. Burk U.C. Schmalhofer O. Zhu F. Sonntag A. Waldvogel B. Vannier C. Darling D. zur Hausen A. Brunton V.G. Morton J. Sansom O. Schüler J. Stemmler M.P. Herzberger C. Hopt U. Keck T. Brabletz S. Brabletz T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar) that miR-200 family members target Klf4 and Sox2, and this could explain why miRNA cluster A accelerates the reprogramming up to a certain stage (MET) and then blunts it. Potential targets of cluster A also belong to (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways not related to cluster C, and this could also derail the process (supplemental Fig. S5 and Table S5). Delivery of cluster A using an inducible system may be a useful way to further study these possibilities. Of note, we also observed increased iPSC clone formation with 3 factors and miR-302–367 in human fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. S6); the effect was not as dramatic as in mouse cells but raises the possibility of further optimization. Lin et al. (11Lin S.L. Chang D.C. Chang-Lin S. Lin C.H. Wu D.T. Chen D.T. Ying S.Y. RNA. 2008; 14: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 17Lin S.L. Chang D.C. Lin C.H. Ying S.Y.

Currently, we are testing different miRNA combinations that include existing genomic clusters and artificial mixtures to define additional signaling pathways and to devise strategies that will improve transgene-free reprogramming. For example, the same principle applied recently to produce human iPSCs with modified mRNAs (18Warren L. Manos P.D. Ahfeldt T. Loh Y.H. Li H. Lau F. Ebina W. Mandal P.K. Smith Z.D. Meissner A.

Our finding that miR-302 represses TGFβR2 may also be relevant in other settings, e.g. cancer stem cells (19Gunaratne P.H. Curr. Stem Cell Res.

Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) observed that, in the original mixture devised by Takahashi and Yamanaka (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18471) Google Scholar), c-Myc can be substituted by components of the miR-290 cluster or by miR-302d. Elimination of c-Myc is desirable because it reduces tumor formation but has a negative effect on reprogramming. However, use of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides involves repeated transfection, and this implies a transient effect, toxicity, and an inability to pool large numbers of miRNAs without reducing their concentration beyond an optimal threshold. The latter is a concern because many ESC-specific miRNAs reside clustered within the same genome locus, and one could argue that delivering some or all these miRNA clusters together should be optimal for producing iPSCs. In this regard, we demonstrate herein that stable overexpression of entire endogenous miRNA clusters can potently improve reprogramming and be an effective tool for mechanistic analysis. Pluripotent and differentiated cell fates are determined at least in part by tissue-specific transcription factors that impose a concrete genetic program (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

IntroductionBrown adipose tissue plays a major role in the control of energy expenditure in mammals. The specific mitochondrial uncoupling that is characteristic of brown adipocytes creates a specialized cell type adapted to promoting energy expenditure in response to cold or overfeeding. In contrast, white adipocytes are specialized in the accumulation of metabolic energy in the form of lipids. Brown adipocytes respond to noradrenergic stimulation through β-adrenoreceptors in the cell surface, which bind norepinephrine and signal through adenylate cyclase to increase cAMP and activate protein kinase A. Ultimately, this signaling cascade lead to activation of hormone-sensitive lipase, induction of the expression of the gene for uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp1) 2The abbreviations used are: Ucp1, uncoupling protein 1; Pgc-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α; Sirt3, silent mating type information regulation 2, homolog 3; Nrf, nuclear respiratory factor; ERR, estrogen-related receptor; Dio2, type II 5′-deiodinase; Fabp4, fatty acid binding protein-4; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; FABP, fatty acid-binding protein. and other genes involved in thermogenesis, and activation of the Ucp1-dependent uncoupling of mitochondria (1Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4423) Google Scholar). Acquisition of the cellular machinery typical of brown adipocyte thermogenic function is a highly plastic process. In fact, pre-adipocytes or even white adipocytes may acquire brown adipocyte properties in response to developmental or environment regulators. Several molecular agents have been reported to promote brown adipocyte differentiation, central among them is Pgc-1α.Pgc-1α is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a major role in the acquisition of the specific brown adipocyte phenotype. Pgc-1α coactivates nuclear receptors and transcription factors and thereby activates genes involved in thermogenesis (e.g. Ucp1), lipid oxidation, and mitochondrial oxidation, which are associated with the specific thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue (2Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). For instance, when white adipocytes are forced to express high levels of Pgc-1α, they acquire the features of brown adipocytes, including expression of the brown fat-specific Ucp1 gene (3Tiraby C. Tavernier G. Lefort C. Larrouy D. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33370-33376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Pgc-1α acquire a partial brown adipocyte phenotype but remain insensitive to noradrenergic activation of thermogenesis (4Uldry M. Yang W. St-Pierre J. Lin J. Seale P. Spiegelman B.M. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 333-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Thus, the control of Pgc-1α gene expression can ultimately determine the acquisition of a brown adipocyte phenotype in an adipose cell. The identification of factors that control Pgc-1α expression and activity is an important prerequisite for developing tools to modulate brown adipocyte activity in the organisms.Sirtuins are protein deacetylases that act on histones, transcription factors, and transcriptional co-regulators, modulating their activities by regulating their degree of acetylation (5Bao J. Sack M.N. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 3073-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Among them, Sirt3 is present in mitochondria and possibly in nuclei as well (6Huang J.Y.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 920-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, Sirt3 controls fatty acid oxidation by deacetylating enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (8Hirschey M.D. Shimazu T. Goetzman E.

Sirt3 gene expression is impaired in brown fat of rodents under conditions of diminished thermogenic activity such as obesity, and it has been proposed that Sirt3 is involved in the control of cAMP-mediated gene expression in brown fat (16Shi T. Wang F. Stieren E. Tong Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13560-13567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar).In the present study, we report that PGC-1α is a major controller of the transcription of the Sirt3 gene. By this means, it contributes to the acquisition of the thermogenic capacity of the brown adipose cell.DISCUSSIONComplex regulation of gene expression is required to program cells to acquire the phenotype of differentiated, thermogenically competent brown adipocytes. This differentiation process allows brown adipocytes to perform the specialized thermogenic function of the cell in response to noradrenergic activation. Pgc-1α is a transcriptional coactivator known to play a master role in eliciting the coordinate induction of gene expression that leads to brown adipocyte differentiation. Increasing Pgc-1α levels can drive white adipocytes to acquire a brown fat phenotype (3Tiraby C. Tavernier G. Lefort C. Larrouy D. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33370-33376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Moreover, Pgc-1α is required for brown adipocytes to acquire the sensitivity to noradrenergic-stimulated thermogenic activation (4Uldry M. Yang W. St-Pierre J. Lin J. Seale P. Spiegelman B.M. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 333-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Our present findings, which constitute the first analysis of Sirt3 gene regulation in brown adipocytes, indicate that Pgc-1α induces Sirt3 gene expression and this effect is essential for brown adipocyte full differentiation. The observations indicating that Pgc-1α is unable to activate the full program of thermogenic gene expression in cells that lack Sirt3 indicates that the induction of Sirt3 may be a mechanism that contributes to the ability of Pgc-1α to promote the widespread cellular effects that lead to the differentiation of fully thermogenic competent brown adipocytes. The specific requirement for Sirt3 in the acquisition of sensitivity to thermogenic activation by brown adipocytes is in complete agreement with the observation of impaired responses to noradrenergic activation in cells with impaired Pgc-1α expression (4Uldry M. Yang W. St-Pierre J. Lin J. Seale P. Spiegelman B.M. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 333-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar).Sirt3 is a protein deacetylase of the sirtuin family, and is considered to control intracellular biological processes by de-acetylating target proteins involved in metabolism and gene expression. It is localized to the mitochondria and, it is controversial whether under specific circumstances, to the nucleus as well (6Huang J.Y. Hirschey M.D. Shimazu T. Ho L. Verdin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The capacity of Sirt3 to influence nuclear gene expression has been reported in several cell models, including brown adipocytes (16Shi T. Wang F. Stieren E. Tong Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13560-13567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 26Jacobs K.M. Pennington J.D. Bisht K.S. Aykin-Burns N. Kim H.S. Mishra M. Sun L. Nguyen P. Ahn B.H. Leclerc J. Deng C.X. Spitz D.R. Gius D. Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2008; 4: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether this is due to signaling from mitochondrial to nuclei (the so-called mitochondrial reverse signaling) or it should be considered a direct consequence of the potential presence of Sirt3 in nuclei, as proposed by some authors (7Scher M.B. Vaquero A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 920-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 12Sundaresan N.R. Gupta M. Kim G. Rajamohan S.B. Isbatan A. Gupta M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 2758-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Shi et al. (16Shi T. Wang F. Stieren E. Tong Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13560-13567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) reported that Sirt3 acts by increasing cAMP-response element-binding protein phosphorylation, but the specific targets of SIRT3 deacetylation among the actors involved in the cascade of noradrenergic induction of gene expression have not been identified to date. In any case, our present findings indicate that Sirt3 expression is an essential component of the specific brown adipocyte phenotype, and is functionally required for brown adipocytes to respond to Pgc-1α-mediated thermogenic activation.Although few studies have been conducted on the thermoregulation of Sirt3-null mice in vivo, Lombard et al. (27Lombard D.B. Alt F.W. Cheng H.L. Bunkenborg J. Streeper R.S. Mostoslavsky R. Kim J. Yancopoulos G. Valenzuela D. Murphy A. Yang Y. Chen Y. Hirschey M.D. Bronson R.T. Haigis M. Guarente L.P. Farese Jr., R.V. Weissman S. Verdin E. Schwer B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8807-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) reported that the response to short-term cold exposure was unaltered in these mice. However, we observed that the thermal stress-induced postnatal expression of the Ucp1 gene is significantly reduced in brown fat from Sirt3-KO mice (28Villarroya F. Giralt A. Planavila A. Hondares E. Iglesias R. Giralt M. J. Physiol. Sci. 2009; 59: 279Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to determine whether inactivation of the Sirt3 gene in vivo influences the overall capacity of adaptive thermogenesis in mice under distinct physiological conditions. Moreover, the possibility that other sirtuins (e.g. Sirt1) might compensate for the lack of Sirt3 cannot be excluded. Although it is not known whether Sirt1 affects BAT differentiation or cAMP responsiveness, chronic activation of Sirt1 in rodents has been reported to promote brown adipose tissue thermogenic activity (29Feige J.N. Lagouge M. Canto C. Strehle A. Houten S.M. Milne J.C. Lambert P.D. Mataki C. Elliott P.J. Auwerx J. Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar).Although Pgc-1α can potentially coactivate multiple nuclear receptors and transcription factors, its action at the Sirt3 promoter appears to involve mainly the orphan nuclear receptor Errα. The identification of Errα as the transcription factor being coactivated by Pgc-1α, and involved in driving the induction of the Sirt3 gene is consistent with the known role of Errα in brown adipocyte function as well as on the transcriptional control of protein preferentially expressed in the mitochondria. Errα appears to be essential for adaptation to cold environment, as evidenced by the failure of mice lacking Errα to maintain body temperature when exposed to cold (30Villena J.A. Hock M.B. Chang W.Y. Barcas J.E. Giguère V. Kralli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Errα is needed for the high levels of oxidative capacity characteristic of brown adipose tissue, and thus for providing the energy necessary for thermogenesis. Errα fulfills this role by acting directly at genes important for brown fat thermogenesis: for instance, it is one of the transcription factors that interact with Pgc-1α to mediate Pgc-1α action on the Ucp1 gene (31Debevec D. Christian M. Morganstein D. Seth A. Herzog B. Parker M. White R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1581-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The present findings demonstrate that Errα is essential for the promotion of Sirt3 gene expression by Pgc-1α. During the preparation of this article, Kong et al. (32Kong X. Wang R. Xue Y. Liu X. Zhang H. Chen Y. Fang F. Chang Y. PLoS. One. 2010; 5: e11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) reported that Pgc-1α controls Sirt3 gene expression in the context of muscle cells. This confirms that the Pgc-1α-Sirt3 regulatory axis may be important not only in brown adipocytes but also in other cell types in which mitochondrial functions are regulated for physiological purposes other than thermogenesis. In summary, we conclude that Pgc-1α controls the expression of Sirt3 in brown adipocytes, and this process may be a relevant intracellular mechanisms by which Pgc-1α conducts its master role in the induction of brown adipocyte phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2141353978,"Fibroblast proliferation is an early feature of progressive tissue fibrosis and is largely regulated by the cytokine transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). In the oral mucosa, fibroblasts have a unique phenotype and demonstrate healing with no fibrosis/scarring. Our previous studies show that whereas dermal fibroblasts proliferate in response to TGF-β1, oral fibroblasts have an antiproliferative response to this cytokine. Hyaluronan (HA) was directly linked to this TGF-β1-dependent response. The aim of this study was to understand the underlying mechanism through which HA regulates TGF-β-dependent responses. Using patient-matched oral and dermal fibroblasts, we show that TGF-β1-dependent proliferation is mediated through the HA receptor CD44, whereas the TGF-β1-mediated antiproliferative response is CD44-independent. Furthermore, overexpression of HAS2 (HA synthase-2) in oral cells modifies their response, and they subsequently demonstrate a proliferative, CD44-dependent response to TGF-β1. We also show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) are essential for TGF-β1/HA/CD44-dependent proliferation. Increased HA levels promote EGFR and CD44 coupling, potentiating signal transduction through the MAPK/ERK pathway. Thus, in a HA-rich environment, late ERK1/2 activation results from EGFR/CD44 coupling and leads to a proliferative response to TGF-β1. In comparison, in a non-HA-rich environment, only early ERK1/2 activation occurs, and this is associated with an antiproliferative response to TGF-β1. In summary, HA facilitates TGF-β1-dependent fibroblast proliferation through promoting interaction between CD44 and EGFR, which then promotes specific MAPK/ERK activation, inducing cellular proliferation."

The most common pathological mutation in LRRK2, G2019S LRRK2, is known to cause neurite retraction. However, molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of neurite length by LRRK2 are unknown. Here, we demonstrate a novel interaction between LRRK2 and the Rho GTPase, Rac1, which plays a critical role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling necessary for the maintenance of neurite morphology. LRRK2 binds strongly to endogenous or expressed Rac1, while showing weak binding to Cdc42 and no binding to RhoA. Co-expression with LRRK2 increases Rac1 activity, as shown by increased binding to the p21-activated kinase, which modulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics. LRRK2 constructs carrying mutations that inactivate the kinase or GTPase activities do not activate Rac1. Interestingly, LRRK2 does not increase levels of membrane-bound Rac1 but dramatically changes the cellular localization of Rac1, causing polarization, which is augmented further when LRRK2 is co-expressed with constitutively active Rac1. Four different disease-related mutations in LRRK2 altered binding to Rac1, with the G2019S and R1441C LRRK2 mutations attenuating Rac1 binding and the Y1699C and I2020T LRRK2 mutations increasing binding. Co-expressing Rac1 in SH-SY5Y cells rescues the G2019S mutant phenotype of neurite retraction. We hypothesize that pathological mutations in LRRK2 attenuates activation of Rac1, causing disassembly of actin filaments, leading to neurite retraction. The interactions between LRRK2 and Rho GTPases provide a novel pathway through which LRRK2 might modulate cellular dynamics and contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are currently the most common genetic cause of familial late-onset Parkinson disease, which is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic disease.

Parkinson disease (PD) 2The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; LRRK2, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2; PAK, p21-activated kinase; ROC, Ras-of-complex; COR, C-terminal of Ras complex; CA, constitutively active; DN, dominant negative. is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder affecting nearly 1% of elderly over 65 years old. Idiopathic PD may result from a combination of factors including age, genetic predisposition, environmental toxins, and neuroinflammation (1Dauer W. Przedborski S.

The missense mutation, G2019S, in the kinase domain of LRRK2 is by far the most common of the LRRK2 mutations associated with PD, and disease associated with the G2019S mutations is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic disease (6Mata I.F.

The Lrrk2 gene of 51 exons encodes a large, multidomain protein that includes an ankyrin repeat and leucine-rich repeat regions (6Mata I.F. Wedemeyer W.J. Farrer M.J. Taylor J.P. Gallo K.A. Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The kinase domain of LRRK2 shares homology with receptor-interacting protein kinases and mixed lineage kinases (3Greggio E. Cookson M.R.

Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). LRRK2 also contains a Ras-of-complex (ROC) domain that exhibits GTPase activity (8Lewis P.A. Greggio E. Beilina A.

Each of these domains is thought to be important for binding but have functions that are unclear at this time. The ROC-COR kinase domains appear to be key domains for function and disease. Most mutations linked to PD are found in the ROC-COR kinase region, and in cases where the binding sites of proteins have been identified, binding appears to occur in these domains (10Hsu C.H.

Recent in vitro and in vivo studies reveal that the overexpression of pathological mutant G2019S LRRK2 causes neurite retraction (14MacLeod D. Dowman J. Hammond R. Leete T. Inoue K. Abeliovich A.

Although autophagy and increased Tau inclusions have been described in conjunction with neurite shortening, the only signaling pathway linked to the G2019S LRRK2-induced neurite pathology is the ERK pathway (10Hsu C.H.

Res. 2007; 85: 1288-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, no upstream triggers were identified. Pathological mutants of LRRK2 were shown to be more toxic than WT LRRK2 as well as LRRK1, a homologue of LRRK2 that does not segregate with disease (21Greggio E. Lewis P.A. van der Brug M.P. Ahmad R. Kaganovich A. Ding J. Beilina A. Baker A.K. Cookson M.R. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the biology of LRRK2 function is still unknown, the prima fascia link between neurite retraction and neurodegeneration provides a compelling avenue for further investigation. The ROC domain in LRRK2 was shown to form homodimers, allowing this GTPase domain to regulate LRRK2 kinase activity (18Gloeckner C.J. Schumacher A. Boldt K. Ueffing M. J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Deng J. Lewis P.A. Greggio E. Sluch E. Beilina A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The ROC domain of LRRK2 contributes to its homodimerization, although sequences outside of the ROC-COR bidomain are also required for dimer formation (18Gloeckner C.J. Schumacher A. Boldt K. Ueffing M. J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Deng J. Lewis P.A. Greggio E. Sluch E. Beilina A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurochem. 2009; 111: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The ability of the LRRK2 ROC GTPase domain to homodimerize with LRRK2 and heterodimerize with LRRK1 led us to hypothesize that this domain might also exhibit binding to other GTPases through a process analogous to heterodimerization. Classical Rho GTPases such as Rac, Cdc42, and RhoA are GTP-binding proteins that have intrinsic GTPase activity (24Watabe-Uchida M. Govek E.E. Van Aelst L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10633-10635Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These Ras-related Rho p21 proteins act as molecular switches as they alternate between the active GTP-bound and the inactive GDP-bound forms. In their active forms, Rho GTPases stimulate downstream effectors to activate a diverse assortment of cellular mechanisms, including vesicular transport, microtubule dynamics, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and cell cycle progression (25Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, 26Heasman S.J. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 690-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 signal through the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family of serine/threonine kinases and other effectors to modulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics, which are critical for axonal outgrowth, maintenance of dendritic spine, and neurite morphology (27Linseman D.A. Loucks F.A. Front Biosci. 2008; 13: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Kreis P. Barnier J.V. Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). More specifically, PAK1 signals through ERK1/2 to regulate actin polymerization and lamellipodium stability (29Smith S.D. Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3729-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Activated Rac and Cdc42 also signal through PAK to activate LIM kinase, which inhibits downstream cofilin, thereby blocking actin depolymerization (30Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Plowey et al. (15Plowey E.D. Cherra 3rd, S.J. Liu Y.J. Chu C.T. J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) found that an ERK inhibitor abolished the G2019S LRRK2-induced neurite retraction in their SH-SY5Y cellular model. PAK signaling through ERK is an interesting upstream trigger that might implicate Rho GTPases in the pathogenesis of neurite shortening. The experiments described below investigate binding of LRRK2 to Rho family GTPases and whether this molecular pathway contributes to the mechanism through which LRRK2 regulates neurite extension and retraction. The current set of studies demonstrates that LRRK2 associates with Rac1, and that LRRK2 and Rac1 functionally interact to regulate neurite growth. Finally, we show that Rac1 can rescue the neurite retraction induced by G2019S LRRK2. WT and mutant LRRK2 V5-His-tagged vectors were generated as described by Greggio et al. (31Greggio E. Zambrano I. Kaganovich A. Beilina A. Taymans J.M. Daniëls V. Lewis P. Jain S. Ding J. Syed A. Thomas K.J. Baekelandt V. Cookson M.R. J. Biol.

Human embryonic kidney 293 FT cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× nonessential amino acids, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mm HEPES, and no antibiotics. SY5Y cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. 10 μm retinoic acid was used to differentiate the SY5Y cells after 24 h in culture on the coverslips. After 72 h, the differentiated SY5Y cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The tetracycline-inducible HEK293 FT LRRK2 cell lines were generated using the Flp-In T-Rex system (Invitrogen). Flp-In T-Rex 293 host cells containing the tetracycline binding protein were purchased from Invitrogen and grown in medium containing DMEM, 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1% (v/v) Pen-Strep mycin, 100 μg ml−1 Zeocin. To introduce LRRK2 (wild-type, G2019S, R1441C), we modified the pcDNA5/FRT/TO expression vector to accept Gateway cloning (Invitrogen) by ligating an attR lambda recombination signal using the topoisomerase cloning site and confirmed by sequencing. LRRK2 (wild-type, G2019S, R1441C) was then introduced into the vector using the Gateway clonase (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were co-transfected with a p0G44 plasmid carrying the Flp-recombinase into the Flp-In T-Rex 293 host cells, and stable integrants were selected by resistance to 200 μg ml−1 hygromycin and 15 μg ml−1 blasticidin. The cells were then maintained in medium containing 100 μg ml−1 hygromycin and 15 μg ml−1 blasticidin. HEK293 FT cells were co-transfected with V5-His-tagged LRRK2 and Myc-tagged Rac1 constructs and harvested in immunoprecipitation buffer which consisted of 0.5% Triton-X, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was precleared with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) followed by addition of the appropriate antibody and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was added to pull down the antibody precomplex. Sepharose beads were washed stringently three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and once with 50 mm Tris (pH 8) wash buffer. The immunoprecipitation proteins were eluted in lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen) by heating at 95 °C for 3 min. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 3–8% NuPAGE Tris acetate or 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blot. Antibodies were purchased from Sigma (V5, FLAG, c-Myc, actin), Calbiochem (calnexin), and Biodesign (GAPDH). Rac activation was assessed using the p21-binding domain of PAK-GST beads to immunoprecipitate GTP-bound fractions of Rac, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). Briefly, cells expressing LRRK2 were lysed in magnesium-containing lysis buffer. The PAK-GST beads were added to 600 μg of total protein and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, after which the samples were washed and prepared for immunoblotting for endogenous Rac1 (Rac1 clone 23A8 antibody from Millipore). HEK293 FT cells plated on glass coverslips were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 at 50% confluency. After 48 h, the transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS at 5-min each and were then incubated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-V5 and anti-myc antibodies overnight at room temperature. After washing the cells three times with PBS at 5-min each, the cells were incubated with a 1:750 dilution of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in 1× PBS. The washes were repeated with 1× PBS, and the cells were incubated with a 1:750 dilution of Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washing the cells three times with 1× PBS at 5-min each, they were embedded in Prolong Gold Antifade DAPI gel mounting medium (Invitrogen). The cells were visualized by three-dimensional multiple wavelength fluorescence microscopy using the Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope for DAPI, FITC, and Texas Red fluorescence at room temperature using an oil immersion 63× Plan-Apochromate lens (aperture set at 1.40). The images were captured using HP CoolSNAP camera and examined as either single sections or projections of an entire stack of optical sections. All images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS2. Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells transfected with LRRK2 and Rac1 constructs were fixed and stained for filamentous actin (phalloidin), LRRK2, and Rac1 expression. Neurite processes from cells positive for LRRK2 expression were quantified using the NeuronJ macros for ImageJ software. HEK293 FT cells or differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with 30 pm negative control (Invitrogen catalog no. 4390843) or LRRK2 siRNA with a fluorescent tag (Invitrogen catalog nos. 272780 and 263837) with Lipofectamine 2000. HEK293 FT cells were lysed with co-immunoprecipitation buffer 3 days after transfection for Western blot analysis of endogenous LRRK2 levels. SH-SY5Y cells were fixed for immunocytochemistry, and cells were stained for filamentous actin (phalloidin) and DAPI. Neurite length was quantified only for cells containing fluorescent siRNA. All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. and graphed using Excel or Prism (GraphPad). One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc tests were performed to identify statistically significant differences using InStat (GraphPad). To determine whether LRRK2 interacts with classical Rho GTPases, co-immunoprecipitation studies were conducted in HEK293 FT cells transiently transfected with LRRK2 and Rho GTPases. Rac1 co-precipitated with LRRK2 following co-expression (Fig. 1A). The interaction between LRRK2 and Rac1 was robust, and LRRK2 bound each form of Rac1 that we examined, including WT, constitutively active (CA), and dominant negative (DN) forms of Rac1 (Fig. 1A), Association also was observed upon immunoprecipitation of Rac1 and probing for LRRK2 (Fig. 1B). We also examined binding between LRRK2 and two other Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and RhoA. LRRK2 showed moderate binding with Cdc42 and little binding with RhoA (Fig. 1C). Given that binding to Rac1 was stronger than binding to Cdc42 or RhoA, we proceeded to focus on the interaction between LRRK2 and Rac1. We also observed association of endogenous LRRK2 and Rac1. LRRK2 was immunoprecipitated from human brain striatum and probed with anti-Rac1 antibody. Rac1 reactivity was readily evident in the LRRK2 immunoprecipitates but not observed when nonspecific IgG was substituted for LRRK2 antibody (Fig. 1D). Next, we examined the domain requirements for association of LRRK2 and Rac1. Rac1 was co-expressed with LRRK2 constructs coding for known functional domains. Rac1 showed strong binding to LRRK2 constructs expressing the COR or kinase domains, as well as a construct expressing the ROC-COR kinase domains (Fig. 1E). Binding to the ROC-COR kinase construct was almost as strong as binding to WT LRRK2, suggesting that the presence of these domains was the predominant requirement for Rac1 binding. We examined whether disease-linked mutations in LRRK2 modified Rac1 activity. LRRK2 constructs (WT, G2019S, R1441C, Y1699C, I2020T) were co-transfected with Rac1 and binding to CA-Rac1 was examined. The G2019S decreased binding to Rac1 moderately, whereas the R1441C mutation strongly inhibited Rac1 binding (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, Y1699C and I2020T constructs had the opposite effect and increased Rac1 activity (Fig. 2, A and B). We also examined the effects of a kinase-dead (KD) LRRK2 construct, which produced decreased Rac1 binding. Thus, mutations in LRRK2 modify binding to Rac1, but the direction of change is not consistent among different familial mutant constructs. PAKs are activated by the GTP-bound forms of Rac1, and binding to PAKs are commonly used to monitor GTPase activity (33Ogita H. Takai Y. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To explore whether LRRK2 regulated Rac1 activity, we transfected HEK293 cells with LRRK2 and examined binding of endogenous Rac1 to PAK-GST beads by co-precipitation. Expression of WT LRRK2 increased the amount of active, endogenous GTP-bound Rac1, whereas the overall expression of Rac1 remained unchanged (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, G2019S and R1441C LRRK2 (Fig. 3A) did not significantly increase Rac1 activity (Fig. 3B). Mutations inactivating LRRK2 kinase activity (K1906M, KD) or GTPase activity (K1347A) also prevented LRRK2 from activating Rac1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar results were observed in cells overexpressing both LRRK2 and Rac1 (data not shown). Activated Rac1 is known to associate with the plasma membrane, where it can activate downstream effectors in various signaling cascades that affect cytoskeletal dynamics and gene transcription, including PAKs (28Kreis P. Barnier J.V. Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because a significant proportion of LRRK2 is also known to be associated with cellular membranes under basal conditions, we hypothesized that LRRK2 might affect the membrane distribution of Rac1 or vice versa (34Biskup S. Moore D.J. Celsi F. Higashi S. West A.B. Andrabi S.A. Kurkinen K. Yu S.W. Savitt J.M. Waldvogel H.J. Faull R.L. Emson P.C. Torp R. Ottersen O.P. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To explore the potential of whether LRRK2 or Rac1 modulate their respective cellular distribution, we investigated the distribution of Rac1 by immunofluorescence. HEK293 FT cells were transfected with LRRK2 and Rac1 (WT, CA, and DN), and localization of the two proteins were determined by immunofluorescence. LRRK2 exhibited a mixed cytoplasmic and membrane distribution when expressed alone, consistent with prior reports of its distribution (Fig. 4, a and c) (34Biskup S. Moore D.J. Celsi F. Higashi S. West A.B. Andrabi S.A. Kurkinen K. Yu S.W. Savitt J.M. Waldvogel H.J. Faull R.L. Emson P.C. Torp R. Ottersen O.P. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Rac1 exhibited strongest expression along the plasma membrane when expressed alone (Fig. 4, e and f). Co-expression of WT Rac1 and LRRK2 produced a striking redistribution of LRRK2 and Rac1, with Rac1 and LRRK2 becoming very polarized (Fig. 4, m–o). Co-transfection of CA-Rac1 accentuated the polarization of LRRK2 and Rac1, with Rac1 and LRRK2 expression being restricted to small foci near processes (Fig. 4, p–r), and also elicited a striking change in the morphology of the cells, consistent with an increased tendency for process extension (Fig. 4, p–r). Because R1441C LRRK2 does not bind or activate Rac1 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), we explored whether R1441C LRRK2 affected Rac1 localization. In contrast to the strong effect of WT LRRK2 on Rac1 localization, co-expressing R1441C LRRK2 with WT-, CA-, or DN-Rac1 had no effect on localization of Rac1 or LRRK2 (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with the known role of Rac1 in stimulating process outgrowth and suggest that LRRK2 might enhance this function of Rac1.FIGURE 5Rac1 does not affect localization of R1441C LRRK2 and vice versa. Expression of R1441C LRRK2 neither co-localized with Rac1 nor modified the distribution of Rac1. CA-Rac1 and DN-Rac1 also were not sensitive to R1441C LRRK2 and did not modify the distribution of R1441C LRRK2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The striking interaction between LRRK2 and Rac1 related to membrane polarization prompted us to examine the interaction of the two proteins in neurons, which is a cell type that normally sends out processes. Previous studies indicate that G2019S LRRK2 causes striking neurite retraction when expressed in differentiated SY5Y cells (15Plowey E.D. Cherra 3rd, S.J. Liu Y.J. Chu C.T. J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We used the same SY5Y neuroblastoma cellular model to investigate functional interactions between LRRK2 and Rac1. Under basal conditions, differentiated SY5Y cells show moderate process outgrowth (Fig. 6A). Expressing WT LRRK2 (Fig. 6A) or WT Rac1 (Fig. 6A) did not produce a statistically significant increase in the amount of outgrowth (Fig. 6B). In contrast, expressing G2019S LRRK2 strongly inhibited neurite outgrowth (Fig. 6, A and B). Co-expressing WT LRRK2 with either WT or CA-Rac1 did not produce any more outgrowth than observed upon expression of any of the proteins alone (Fig. 6, A and B). However, co-expressing Rac1 with G2019S LRRK2 rescued the differentiated SY5Y neurite phenotype. Expressing WT Rac1 with G2019S LRRK2 restored neurite levels to that observed under basal conditions of differentiation (i.e. without transfected genes, Fig. 6, A and B). Co-expression of CA-Rac1 with G2019S LRRK2, however, increased neurite extension to that observed with co-expression of WT LRRK2 and CA-Rac1 (Fig. 6, A and B). These results show that Rac1 can compensate for functional deficits caused by G2019S expression. Other mutations did not affect neurite length, and Rac1 (even DN-Rac1) did not exert strong effects on neurite length in the presence of the mutant LRRK2 constructs (Fig. 6B). We tested whether endogenous LRRK2 modulates neurite outgrowth by knocking down LRRK2 with siRNA (Fig. 7). Knockdown of LRRK2 was optimized in HEK293 cells where high transfection efficiency allowed immunoblotting and quantification of the LRRK2 protein levels (Fig. 7, A and B). Next, we examined the effects of siRNA knockdown in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were transfected with fluorescence-tagged siRNA (LRRK2 or scrambled control). After 72 h, cells taking up siRNA were identified by fluorescence microscopy, and the neurite process length was quantified. siRNA for LRRK2, but not scrambled siRNA, significantly inhibited SH-SY5Y process length (Fig. 7, C and D). Thus, endogenous LRRK2 regulates neurite length. The studies presented above indicate that LRRK2 binds the Rho-type GTPase Rac1 and that the two proteins functionally interact. We also investigated binding to RhoA and Cdc42 but observed that that the interactions were weaker. LRRK2 and Rac1 can be immunoprecipitated as a complex, they both partially co-localize at the membrane and exhibit mutual functional effects. Overexpressing Rac1 increases the amount of membrane-associated LRRK2. Overexpressing LRRK2 exerts a more subtle effect on Rac1. Biochemical fractionation does not show overt differences in Rac1 membrane translocation, possibly becaus"
https://openalex.org/W2028684043,"Much progress has been made concerning histone function in the nucleus; however, following their synthesis, how their marking and subcellular trafficking are regulated remains to be explored. To gain an insight into these issues, we focused on soluble histones and analyzed endogenous and tagged H3 histones in parallel. We distinguished six complexes that we could place to account for maturation events occurring on histones H3 and H4 from their synthesis onward. In each complex, a different set of chaperones is involved, and we found specific post-translational modifications. Interestingly, we revealed that histones H3 and H4 are transiently poly(ADP-ribosylated). The impact of these marks in histone metabolism proved to be important as we found that acetylation of lysines 5 and 12 on histone H4 stimulated its nuclear translocation. Furthermore, we showed that, depending on particular histone H3 modifications, the balance in the presence of the different translocation complexes changes. Therefore, our results enabled us to propose a regulatory means of these marks for controlling cytoplasmic/nuclear shuttling and the establishment of early modification patterns."

We found that decorin null myoblasts are more sensitive to CTGF than wild type myoblasts, as evaluated by the accumulation of fibronectin or collagen III. Decorin added exogenously negatively regulated CTGF pro-fibrotic activity and the induction of actin stress fibers. Using co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction assays, decorin and CTGF were shown to interact in a saturable manner with a Kd of 4.4 nm. This interaction requires the core protein of decorin. Experiments using the deletion mutant decorin indicated that the leucine-rich repeats (LRR) 10–12 are important for the interaction with CTGF and the negative regulation of the cytokine activity, moreover, a peptide derived from the LRR12 was able to inhibit CTGF-decorin complex formation and CTGF activity. Finally, we showed that CTGF specifically induced the synthesis of decorin, suggesting a mechanism of autoregulation.

https://openalex.org/W2039058904,"The β-globin locus undergoes dynamic chromatin interaction changes in differentiating erythroid cells that are thought to be important for proper globin gene expression. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The CCCTC-binding factor, CTCF, binds to the insulator elements at the 5' and 3' boundaries of the locus, but these sites were shown to be dispensable for globin gene activation. We found that, upon induction of differentiation, cohesin and the cohesin loading factor Nipped-B-like (Nipbl) bind to the locus control region (LCR) at the CTCF insulator and distal enhancer regions as well as at the specific target globin gene that undergoes activation upon differentiation. Nipbl-dependent cohesin binding is critical for long-range chromatin interactions, both between the CTCF insulator elements and between the LCR distal enhancer and the target gene. We show that the latter interaction is important for globin gene expression in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the results indicate that such cohesin-mediated chromatin interactions associated with gene regulation are sensitive to the partial reduction of Nipbl caused by heterozygous mutation. This provides the first direct evidence that Nipbl haploinsufficiency affects cohesin-mediated chromatin interactions and gene expression. Our results reveal that dynamic Nipbl/cohesin binding is critical for developmental chromatin organization and the gene activation function of the LCR in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1977130681,"To achieve accurate DNA synthesis, DNA polymerases must rapidly sample and discriminate against incorrect nucleotides. Here we report the crystal structure of a high fidelity DNA polymerase I bound to DNA primer-template caught in the act of binding a mismatched (dG:dTTP) nucleoside triphosphate. The polymerase adopts a conformation in between the previously established ""open"" and ""closed"" states. In this ""ajar"" conformation, the template base has moved into the insertion site but misaligns an incorrect nucleotide relative to the primer terminus. The displacement of a conserved active site tyrosine in the insertion site by the template base is accommodated by a distinctive kink in the polymerase O helix, resulting in a partially open ternary complex. We suggest that the ajar conformation allows the template to probe incoming nucleotides for complementarity before closure of the enzyme around the substrate. Based on solution fluorescence, kinetics, and crystallographic analyses of wild-type and mutant polymerases reported here, we present a three-state reaction pathway in which nucleotides either pass through this intermediate conformation to the closed conformation and catalysis or are misaligned within the intermediate, leading to destabilization of the closed conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1968732216,"Humans live in symbiosis with 10(14) commensal bacteria among which >99% resides in their gastrointestinal tract. The molecular bases pertaining to the interaction between mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA) and bacteria residing in the intestine are not known. Previous studies have demonstrated that commensals are naturally coated by SIgA in the gut lumen. Thus, understanding how natural SIgA interacts with commensal bacteria can provide new clues on its multiple functions at mucosal surfaces. Using fluorescently labeled, nonspecific SIgA or secretory component (SC), we visualized by confocal microscopy the interaction with various commensal bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides strains. These experiments revealed that the interaction between SIgA and commensal bacteria involves Fab- and Fc-independent structural motifs, featuring SC as a crucial partner. Removal of glycans present on free SC or bound in SIgA resulted in a drastic drop in the interaction with gram-positive bacteria, indicating the essential role of carbohydrates in the process. In contrast, poor binding of gram-positive bacteria by control IgG was observed. The interaction with gram-negative bacteria was preserved whatever the molecular form of protein partner used, suggesting the involvement of different binding motifs. Purified SIgA and SC from either mouse hybridoma cells or human colostrum exhibited identical patterns of recognition for gram-positive bacteria, emphasizing conserved plasticity between species. Thus, sugar-mediated binding of commensals by SIgA highlights the currently underappreciated role of glycans in mediating the interaction between a highly diverse microbiota and the mucosal immune system."

We investigated whether conserved cysteines in FXYD proteins are susceptible to glutathionylation and whether such reactivity affects Na+-K+ pump function in cardiac myocytes and Xenopus oocytes. Glutathionylation was detected by immunoblotting streptavidin precipitate from biotin-GSH loaded cells or by a GSH antibody. Incubation of myocytes with recombinant FXYD proteins resulted in competitive displacement of native FXYD1. Myocyte and Xenopus oocyte pump currents were measured with whole-cell and two-electrode voltage clamp techniques, respectively. Native FXYD1 in myocytes and FXYD1 expressed in oocytes were susceptible to glutathionylation. Mutagenesis identified the specific cysteine in the cytoplasmic terminal that was reactive. Its reactivity was dependent on flanking basic amino acids. We have reported that Na+-K+ pump β1 subunit glutathionylation induced by oxidative signals causes pump inhibition in a previous study. In the present study, we found that β1 subunit glutathionylation and pump inhibition could be reversed by exposing myocytes to exogenous wild-type FXYD3. A cysteine-free FXYD3 derivative had no effect. Similar results were obtained with wild-type and mutant FXYD proteins expressed in oocytes.

Data revealed a novel role for oleate in preventing palmitate-induced ceramide synthesis, and this occurred through preventing palmitate-induced up-regulation of dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1), which is the enzyme responsible for generating ceramide from its precursor dihydroceramide, thus controlling cellular ratios of dihydroceramide to ceramide. This activity of oleate protected cells from the loss of insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation caused by palmitate, as knockdown of this enzyme also protected from palmitate-induced insulin resistance, and overexpression of this enzyme overcame the protective effects of oleate. These data indicate novel, antagonistic regulatory roles for palmitate and oleate on DES1, support a key role of DES1 in mediating fatty acid-induced insulin resistance, and provide mechanistic insights into the protective effects of oleate in human health.

Bielawska A. Methods. 2006; 39: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were extracted in 1-butanol:Triton-X 100:methanol (4:1:1, v/v). The samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight, probe-sonicated for 10 s, and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 4500 × g, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined. Triglycerides were measured according to the method described in the triglyceride determination kit (Sigma Aldrich, TR0100). Total RNA from C2C12 myotubes was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA using the SuperScriptTM First-strand Synthesis System for an RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Cycler system (Bio-Rad) as described previously (21Hu W. Bielawski J. Samad F. Merrill Jr., A.H. Cowart L.A. J. Lipid. Res. 2009; 50: 1852-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mouse DES1 and DES2 primers were ordered from SuperArray Bioscience Corporation. β-actin or GAPDH were used as reference genes. siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected into differentiated myotubes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. DES1 siRNA and negative control siRNA were from Qiagen. The DES1 siRNA target sequence was 5′-CACCTTTGACATTATCATTTA-3′, with sense strand 5′-CCUUUGACAUUAUCAUUUATT-3′ and antisense strand 5′-UAAAUGAUAAUGUCAAAGGTG-3′. GenBankTM accession no. was NM_007853. At 72 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with FFAs for 14 h and then stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min for analysis of phospho-Akt by Western blot. Microsomes were prepared as described previously (22Mao C. Xu R. Szulc Z.M. Bielawski J. Becker K.P. Bielawska A. Galadari S.H. Hu W. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31184-31191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, C2C12 myotubes were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed with a Dounce Homogenizer (40 strokes) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were sonicated for 10 s and chilled on ice for 20 s, and this was repeated two times. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C. The microsome pellets were dissolved in 50 mm K2PO4, pH 7.4 buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCATM protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). DES1 activity assays were performed as described previously with minor modifications (23Schulze H. Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, DES1 activity is determined by following the formation of tritiated water that accompanied the 4,5-double bond formation if the substrate is labeled appropriately. The labeled N-octanoyl-[4,5–3H]-d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine was used as hot substrate. The cold substrate is N-octanoyl-d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine. To prepare the substrate mixture, 2 nm hot substrate (equal to 0.125 uCi, and ∼100,000 decays per minute), 500 nm cold substrate were dissolved in 1.1 mg of CHAPS (in 10 μl of water). 10-μl substrate mixtures and 100 μg of protein were added to the reaction mixture containing 2 mm NADH, 20 mm bicine, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm sucrose, in a final volume of 200 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 1.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) followed by 0.4 ml of water. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. 800 μl of the aqueous phase was counted by liquid scintillation. The DES1 enzyme activity is expressed as pmol/ml protein/h. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm Na4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet, 0.1% phenylmethyl sulfluoride, and protease inhibitors (0.08 μm aprotinin, 0.02 μm leupeptin, 0.04 μm bestatin, and 15 μm pepstaitin). To prepare total cell lysates, cell extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Proteins (10 μg) from cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated overnight in 5% milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were subsequently incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP or donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP was used as secondary antibody. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse DES1 overexpression vector and empty vector control (pReceiver-M2) were purchased from GeneCopoeia (EX-Mm 19326-M02 and EX-NEG-M2, respectively). The plasmid DNA was amplified in Escherichia coli and then purified by using QIAfilter Maxi kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Transfection of plasmid DNA into mouse C2C12 myotubes was accomplished using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Mouse primary myoblasts were isolated as described previously (24Springer M. Rando T. Blau H. Boyle A. Current Protocols in Human Genetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 13.4.1-13.4.19Google Scholar). Briefly, muscles were isolated from the hind limbs of 12-week old C57BL/6J male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). To disrupt the tissues, they were placed in collagenase/dispase/CaCl2 solution (1.5 units/ml collagenase D from Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA; 2.4 units/ml dispase II from Invitrogen; and 2.5 mm CaCl2)and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Isolated cells were filtered and resuspended in F-10-based primary myoblast growth medium (F10 nutrient mixture (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS, 25 μg/ml human basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen)). Cells were plated on calf collagen (Fisher Scientific) coated plates. Cells were maintained in F-10-based primary myoblast growth medium for 7 days. Myoblasts were then maintained in F-10/DMEM-based primary myoblast growth media (40% F-10-based primary myoblast growth medium and 40% DMEM) for an additional 4 days. Confluent cells were differentiated in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum. After 7 days of differentiation, myotubes were formed and utilized for experiments. Previous studies by our group showed that palmitate caused broad changes in cell sphingolipids. Specifically, most sphingolipids were elevated by palmitate treatment, which occurred primarily via de novo synthesis (21Hu W. Bielawski J. Samad F. Merrill Jr., A.H. Cowart L.A. J. Lipid. Res. 2009; 50: 1852-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One limitation of this study is that cells in vivo are exposed to mixtures of fatty acids, rather than single fatty acids. Moreover, other studies have indicated a role for oleate attenuation of palmitate-induced increases in DAG (11Coll T. Eyre E. Rodríguez-Calvo R. Palomer X. Sánchez R.M. Merlos M. Laguna J.C. Vázquez-Carrera M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11107-11116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 25Henique C. Mansouri A. Fumey G. Lenoir V. Girard J. Bouillaud F. Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36818-36827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that oleate may also attenuate palmitate-induced increases in sphingolipids. To test this, C2C12 myotubes were treated with palmitate in the presence of 0.75 mm oleate and total sphingolipids were determined by LC/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These data indicated that co-treatment with oleate could completely inhibit palmitate-induced ceramide (Fig. 1A). Intriguingly however, dihydroceramide, the immediate metabolic precursor of ceramide, was only partially inhibited (∼33%, Fig. 1A). Dihydroceramide is generated by six distinct (dihydro)ceramide synthase enzymes (26Pewzner-Jung Y. Ben-Dor S. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25001-25005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), which catalyze N-acylation of dihydrosphingosine. Each of these enzymes has partially distinct selectivity for acyl-CoAs of various chain lengths, and together they generate dihydroceramides ranging from C14 to C26 or longer N-acyl chains. We observed that the decreases in ceramides occurred similarly in each N-acyl chain-length measured (Fig. 1B), and thus, the mechanism for decreasing ceramide appeared nonspecific with respect to N-acyl chain length. This suggested that oleate mediates its inhibition of ceramide generation by means other than attenuation of specific ceramide synthase isoforms and/or activities. This conclusion, coupled with the observation that dihydroceramides were only partially attenuated by oleate, led to the hypothesis that oleate prevents desaturation of dihydroceramide. De novo ceramide is derived from the action of dihydroceramide desaturase, DES1, a required enzyme for de novo ceramide synthesis responsible for inserting the 4,5-trans-double bond into the sphingoid backbone of dihydroceramide (27Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28Geeraert L. Mannaerts G.P. van Veldhoven P.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Though two isoforms of this enzyme occur in mammals, recent data indicate that only DES1 has this enzymatic activity, and thus, is the sole enzyme responsible for conversion of dihydroceramide to ceramide (27Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that oleate may regulate DES1 expression. To test this, myotubes were treated with palmitate at concentrations from 0.1 to 1.5 mm. RNA was isolated from these cells and used for qPCR. These results demonstrated that palmitate markedly increased the message of DES1 in a dose-dependent manner, which was first observed at 0.2 mm and increased in magnitude up to 1.0 mm (supplemental Fig. 1), concentrations that span healthy physiological range at the lower doses up to pathophysiological elevation at the upper doses (29Roden M. Physiology. 2004; 19: 92-96Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Moreover, DES1 message increase was observed as early as 9 h and continued to increase up to 20 h (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, co-treatment with 0.75 mm oleate completely attenuated this increase, showing maximum inhibitory activity as early as 8 h (Fig. 2A). Dose-response experiments were conducted in myotubes treated with palmitate plus oleate at concentrations of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.5 mm. The results revealed that oleate attenuated DES1 increase at concentrations as low as 0.1 mm, with maximum inhibition at 0.5 mm (Fig. 2B). In sum, these data demonstrated that physiologically relevant concentrations of palmitate and oleate regulate DES1 in C2C12 myotubes according to the concentrations of each fatty acid. To test whether these effects were specific to the C2C12 system or would demonstrate applicability to other skeletal muscle systems, similar experiments were performed in primary isolates of mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts differentiated in vitro to myotubes. Consistent with the C2C12 results, DES1 message also increased in these mouse myotubes treated with 0.5 mm palmitate, and oleate attenuated the induction (supplemental Fig. 2). To test whether changes in message affected enzyme activity, dihydroceramide desaturase activity was determined in microsomes prepared from C2C12 cells treated with palmitate with and without oleate co-treatment. The data indicated that oleate decreased microsomal DES1 activity by ∼45% (Fig. 2C). These data indicated a novel role for both palmitate and oleate in regulation of DES1, and thus, we sought to determine the specificity of biologically relevant saturated versus unsaturated FFAs in regulation of DES1. Palmitate and stearate (C18:0) comprise the majority of plasma saturated fatty acids, and thus, myotubes were treated with 1.25 mm palmitate or 1.25 mm stearate. The qPCR measurements of DES1 message indicated that palmitate, but not stearate, increased DES1 (Fig. 3A). This striking difference in activities between these two very similar fatty acids indicates a surprising selectivity for palmitate in regulation of DES1. To evaluate stearate effects on ceramide and dihydroceramide, myotubes were treated with 0.75 mm stearate and cotreatment with 0.75 mm palmitate. Intriguingly, stearate increased both ceramide and dihydroceramide, but, cotreatment could not prevent Cer increase (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). We also sought to determine the specificity of the inhibitory effect of oleate on DES1 increase. Thus, myotubes were treated with palmitate and cotreated with the related and relatively abundant monounsaturated fatty acids palmitoleate (C16:1), oleate (C18:1), or eicosenoic acid (C20:1), and also the essential polyunsaturated linoleic acid (C18:2). The measurements indicated that each monounsaturated species behaved similarly to oleate in attenuation of DES1 message increase by palmitate. On the other hand, inhibition of DES1 message increase by linoleic acid was relatively weak, suggesting that this activity is specific to monounsaturated fatty acids, and, moreover, is not determined by acyl chain length (Fig. 3B). Elevated plasma lipids mediate a number of downstream effects in various tissues to promote diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. A key such activity is the attenuation of insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle (17Schmitz-Peiffer C. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 967: 146-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Sell H.

This is thought to arise, at least in part, by the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in response to insulin by ceramide (6Chavez J.A. Summers S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 32Ghosh N. Patel N. Jiang K. Watson J.E. Cheng J. Chalfant C.E. Cooper D.R. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test whether oleate could prevent palmitate-induced insulin desensitization, myotubes were treated with palmitate alone or in combination with oleate. Cells were treated with 0.25 mm to 1.25 mm palmitate for 16 h and then stimulated with insulin. Phosphorylation status of Akt was assessed by Western blot. The results indicated Akt phosphorylation was inhibited even at low concentrations, with significant inhibition observed at 0.25 mm palmitate (Fig. 4A). At 0.5 mm palmitate, co-treatment with oleate demonstrated restoration of insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation at concentrations as low as 0.1 mm (Fig. 4B). To confirm the effects of these treatments on insulin signaling, phosphorylation of the downstream Akt substrates GSK3α/β was assessed by Western blot, and results demonstrated phosphorylation of both isoforms mirrored the Akt phosphorylation state, with no palmitate-mediated inhibition observed at 6 h, followed by robust attenuation of insulin signaling from 12–24 h, and restoration of p-Akt by oleate co-treatment at similar time points (Fig. 4C). These results were consistent with fatty acid effects on DES1 message, which, at 6 h demonstrated a <15% increase upon palmitate treatment, but increased >50% by 12 h (Fig. 4D), the first point at which an effect on p-Akt was observed (Fig. 4C). This result is also consistent with our previous studies, which indicated relatively small palmitate-induced increases in ceramide prior to 8 h (21Hu W. Bielawski J. Samad F. Merrill Jr., A.H. Cowart L.A. J. Lipid. Res. 2009; 50: 1852-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effect of oleate co-treatment on restoration of p-Akt in response to insulin was observed at similar time points as the maximum effect on DES1 expression (Fig. 4, C and D). Additionally, ceramide levels were attenuated under these conditions, with a >30% decrease by 12 h and a >50% decrease at 24 h (supplemental Fig. 4). Together, these results indicate that the effects of palmitate and oleate on DES1 expression, lipid levels, and insulin signaling occurred at comparable lipid concentrations and time points. Studies indicate that palmitate increases both ceramide and DAG (14Pickersgill L. Litherland G.J. Greenberg A.S. Walker M. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12583-12589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Chavez J.A. Knotts T.A. Wang L.P. Li G. Dobrowsky R.T. Florant G.L. Summers S.A. J. Biol.

Shulman G.I. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 32: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 34Kraegen E.W. Cooney G.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2008; 19: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to test whether adding back ceramide could overcome the protective effect of oleate. After cotreatment with palmitate and oleate for 14 h, the cells were incubated with exogenous 50 μm C2-ceramide for 2 h before insulin stimulation. Data indicate that C2-ceramide addition overcame the protective effect of oleate on Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Because palmitate also increases DAG, we sought to determine the effect of oleate on DAG levels in cells. DAG species were measured by LC/MS after palmitate treatment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total DAG increased >2-fold in cells treated with 1.25 mm palmitate. Intriguingly, co-treatment with 0.5 mm oleate increased DAG >5-fold relative to control cells (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that oleate does not attenuate DAG synthesis under these conditions and, moreover, that oleate protects from palmitate-induced insulin resistance, strongly supporting that ceramide, not DAG, is the active species in insulin resistance under these conditions. The LC/MS analysis provided data on the chain length composition of DAG generated by palmitate or palmitate-oleate co-treatment. As shown in Fig. 5C, palmitate increased all DAG species with palmitoyl chains except for C16/C18:1. However, this species was increased >10-fold upon addition of"
https://openalex.org/W2043907233,"A limited decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential can be beneficial for cells, especially under some pathological conditions, suggesting that mild uncouplers (protonophores) causing such an effect are promising candidates for therapeutic uses. The great majority of protonophores are weak acids capable of permeating across membranes in their neutral and anionic forms. In the present study, protonophorous activity of a series of derivatives of cationic rhodamine 19, including dodecylrhodamine (C(12)R1) and its conjugate with plastoquinone (SkQR1), was revealed using a variety of assays. Derivatives of rhodamine B, lacking dissociable protons, showed no protonophorous properties. In planar bilayer lipid membranes, separating two compartments differing in pH, diffusion potential of H(+) ions was generated in the presence of C(12)R1 and SkQR1. These compounds induced pH equilibration in liposomes loaded with the pH probe pyranine. C(12)R1 and SkQR1 partially stimulated respiration of rat liver mitochondria in State 4 and decreased their membrane potential. Also, C(12)R1 partially stimulated respiration of yeast cells but, unlike the anionic protonophore FCCP, did not suppress their growth. Loss of function of mitochondrial DNA in yeast (grande-petite transformation) is known to cause a major decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. We found that petite yeast cells are relatively more sensitive to the anionic uncouplers than to C(12)R1 compared with grande cells. Together, our data suggest that rhodamine 19-based cationic protonophores are self-limiting; their uncoupling activity is maximal at high membrane potential, but the activity decreases membrane potentials, which causes partial efflux of the uncouplers from mitochondria and, hence, prevents further membrane potential decrease."

Genetic analysis indicated that their formation depends on LRAT, and several lines of evidence suggested that retinosomes located close to the RPE plasma membrane are essential particles involved in regeneration of 11-cis-retinal (5von Lintig J.

Brasaemle D.L. McAndrews-Hill M. Sztalryd C. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 468-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Mice lacking exons 2 and 3 of the gene encoding PLIN2 evidenced slowed dark adaptation, probably due to delayed clearance of all-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinol from rod photoreceptor cells (27Imanishi Y. Sun W. Maeda T. Maeda A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25091-25102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, two-photon microscopy (TPM) revealed aberrant trafficking of all-trans-retinyl esters in the RPE of these mice, a problem caused by prolonged maintenance of retinosomes in the dark-adapted state. These findings suggest that PLIN2 plays a unique role in vision by maintaining proper storage and trafficking of retinoids within the eye. They also imply that a common mechanism underlies the biogenesis of retinosomes and lipid droplets because PLIN2 is a prominent component of lipid droplets in other tissues (28Brasaemle D.L.

Based on these findings, these droplets are becoming recognized as active intracellular organelles that contribute to several processes such as lipid metabolism, intracellular trafficking, and signaling (33Brasaemle D.L.

Our observations provide evidence for a close relationship between retinosomes in the RPE and lipid droplets in other types of cells.RESULTSWe first investigated the formation of lipid droplets in five experimental cell lines, i.e. transformed human RPE cells called ARPE19 cells, human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells, mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells engineered to express LRAT (NIH/L) (42Golczak M.

We tested whether these cells could convert all-trans-retinol to retinyl esters and use oleate to form lipid droplets. We then employed mixtures of all-trans-retinol and oleate to determine whether their products co-localized within the test cells. Finally, we repeated these experiments with native bovine RPE cells and analyzed the derived retinosomes to determine how their composition compared with that published for lipid droplets derived from other cell types.Treatment of Cell Lines with All-trans-retinol and OleateWe chose to expose cells to oleate because this fatty acid is converted into cytoplasmic triacylglycerol in considerably higher amounts than more toxic short chain fatty acids, such as caprylic acid (53Wongsiriroj N. Piantedosi R. Palczewski K. Goldberg I.J. Johnston T.P. Li E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2010; 652: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), that do not readily form lipid droplets. Following incubation with either oleate or all-trans-retinol, formation of lipid droplets was observed (Fig. 1). Both control NIH3T3 cells and the NIH/L and NIH/RL cell lines engineered to produce retinyl esters formed lipid droplets following treatment with all-trans-retinol. However, fewer lipid droplets were seen in NIH3T3/RL cells as compared with NIH3T3/L cells after treatment with 10 μm all-trans-retinol. This reduction in droplets probably is due to the presence of RPE65, which uses retinyl esters as substrates. Interestingly, NIH3T3 cells that do not express LRAT and the ARPE19 cell line with dramatically reduced LRAT expression compared with primary RPE cells also formed lipid droplets following treatment with all-trans-retinol. The number of lipid droplets was observed to increase after 60 min of treatment together with a consequent reduction of cytoplasmic background staining with BODIPY493/503 (Fig. 1C). Treatment of NIH3T3 cells with all-trans-retinol alone the 1st day and a mixture of oleate and all-trans-retinol on the 2nd day showed that oleate and all-trans-retinol localized in the same lipid droplets. Fig. 2A, panel a, shows images of these cells acquired after their exposure to UV light, whereas Fig. 2A, panel b, shows staining with BODIPY493/503 that specifically targets neutral lipids. Co-localization was also observed when cells were treated with oleate the 1st day and a mixture of all-trans-retinol and oleate the 2nd day (Fig. 2B). These structures showed co-localization with PLIN2 (Fig. 2B, panel b) but not with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Fig. 2C, panel b).FIGURE 2Fluorescence microscopy of NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells evidenced net formation of heterogeneous lipid droplets following incubation at 37 °C with oleate and all-trans-retinol. Cells were seeded at 1 million cells/plate. Three independent experiments were done, each with seven plates. A shows images of NIH3T3 cells after treatment with 10 μm all-trans-retinol for the first 24 h followed by a mixture of oleate (100 μm) and all-trans-retinol (10 μm) for another 24 h at 37 °C. A, panel a depicts the resulting UV-all-trans-retinol image, and panel b reveals lipid droplets stained with BODIPY493/503. The merged figure is seen in panel c. B demonstrates the fluorescence of NIH3T3 cells treated with oleate on the 1st day and a mixture of oleate and all-trans-retinol on the 2nd day, i.e. the reverse of the A protocol. B, panel a shows both UV imaging for all-trans-retinal and nuclear staining with DAPI, and panel b depicts staining with the lipid droplet marker PLIN2. Panel c displays the overlaid image of panels a and b. C exhibits NIH3T3 cells treated as described for B. C, panel a shows lipid droplets stained with BODIPY493/503, and panel b shows staining with the lysosomal marker LAMP1. Panel c is the merged image. Arrows indicate lipid droplets. The results demonstrate that all-trans-retinol and PLIN2 co-localize in lipid droplets, whereas all-trans-retinol and the lysosomal marker LAMP1 do not.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Formation of Retinyl EstersWe then tested the net production of retinyl esters following treatment with all-trans-retinol in our model cell lines. After treatment of cell lines with all-trans-retinol, retinyl esters were separated based on the length of their fatty acid chains. As expected, cell lines engineered to express LRAT, i.e. NIH/L and NIH/RL cells, produced retinyl esters (Fig. 3, C and D). The broad/merged peaks seen in Fig. 3, C and D, resulted from heterogeneity in the fatty acid composition of these esters, because our chromatographic conditions did not separate 9-cis- and 13-cis-retinyl esters, and because, for example, palmitoyl esters of these isomers eluted as sharp overlapping peaks. By contrast, a cell line such as NIH3T3 with no LRAT expression was devoid of retinyl esters (Fig. 3B). However, an increased number of lipid droplets was observed in control NIH3T3 and ARPE19 cells even in the presence of unesterified all-trans-retinol. TLC analysis of isolated lipid droplets from these cell lines showed that all-trans-retinol treatment resulted in increased triglyceride content (Fig. 3, A and B, inset). This effect was not studied further. But because of absent esterification, it could result from oxidation of retinol to retinal and then to retinoic acid, especially with increased expression of lipid-metabolizing enzymes (53Wongsiriroj N. Piantedosi R. Palczewski K. Goldberg I.J. Johnston T.P. Li E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13510-13519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the case of lipid droplets isolated from NIH/L and NIH/RL cell lines, treatment with all-trans-retinol did not cause a statistically significant increase in triglyceride content but rather an increase in retinyl esters as described above. These results suggest that the minimum required for lipid droplet formation is a hydrophobic substance with a propensity to aggregate, the precise chemical structure of this entity being of secondary importance.FIGURE 3Retinyl ester analyses following treatment of cell cultures with 10 μm all-trans-retinol. Following treatment with 10 μm all-trans-retinol, cell homogenates were processed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The HPLCs shown are representative of triplicate experiments wherein each experiment involved 1 plate with 1 million cells. HPLCs of treated cells are depicted in solid black lines, and those of untreated cell lines are shown as dashed lines. A shows ARPE19; B shows NIH3T3; C shows NIH3T3/L, and D shows NIH3T3/RL cell chromatograms. Retinyl esters with elution times ranging from 10 to 20 min were detected only in NIH3T3/L and NIH3T3/RL cell homogenates. Insets show TLCs of triglycerides in lipid droplets isolated from untreated cells and cells treated with all-trans-retinol. The results demonstrate that the lipid droplet composition differs in the LRAT-expressing cell lines and that all-trans-retinol induces triglyceride formation in ARPE19 and NIH3T3 cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TPM Imaging of Retinosomes in Bovine RPETPM is a noninvasive imaging technique that can be used to monitor retinoids within the vertebrate retina at subcellular resolution (15Imanishi Y.

This method has the great advantage of portraying endogenous retinoid fluorophores in their native environment without the need for artificial staining. Because retinosomes were discovered by applying two-photon excitation to image mouse retina and detected with TPM in human retinas (55Guo X. Ruiz A. Rando R.R. Bok D. Gudas L.J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we first investigated if they were present in bovine eyes as well. Indeed, TPM imaging of freshly dissected, flat-mounted ex vivo bovine RPE revealed many lipid droplets visible as bright fluorescent dots located primarily near cell plasma membranes (Fig. 4A). The finer details of bovine RPE and retinosome distribution are shown in Fig. 4B. Interestingly, most bovine RPE cells contain single nuclei in contrast to mouse RPE, which predominantly house double nuclei (15Imanishi Y. Batten M.L. Piston D.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The two-photon excited emission spectrum (Fig. 4C) corresponds to that obtained from mouse RPE (16Palczewska G. Maeda T.

A transverse view of the RPE assembled from a series of TPM optical z slice sections indicates that retinosomes extend from the apical side of the RPE toward the basal side that faces the choroid (Fig. 4, D and E). This is substantiated by supplemental movie M1, created by using 20 consecutive slice images taken every 1.85 μm along the z axis. Moreover, imaging the fraction 1 fatty layer under UV excitation revealed the characteristic autofluorescence of lipid droplets as described previously (30Blaner W.S. O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N.

To investigate the molecular mechanisms of contact-dependent BMP signaling, we developed novel in vitro assay systems to monitor trans signaling using Drosophila S2 cells. Using immunoblot-based as well as single-cell assay systems, we present evidence that Drosophila glypicans indeed enhance BMP signaling in trans in a contact-dependent manner in vitro. Our analysis showed that heparan sulfate modification is required for the trans co-receptor activity of DALLY. Two BMP-like molecules, Decapentaplegic (DPP) and Glass bottom boat, can mediate trans signaling through a heparan sulfate proteoglycan co-receptor in S2 cells. The in vitro systems reflect the molecular characteristics of heparan sulfate proteoglycan functions observed previously in vivo, such as ligand specificity and biphasic activity dependent on the ligand dosage. In addition, experiments using a DALLY-coated surface suggested that DALLY regulates DPP signaling in trans by its effect on the stability of DPP protein on the surface of the contacting cells.

Remarkably, these molecules mediate both long and short range signaling dependent on context. For example, Decapentaplegic (DPP), a Drosophila homologue of BMPs, acts as a long range morphogen in the developing wing and as a contact-dependent niche factor in the female germ line stem cell (GSC) niche. The molecular basis underlying this differential activity of BMPs is not fully understood. Signaling and distribution of BMPs in a tissue are modulated by a class of carbohydrate-modified molecules, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (1Jackson S.M. Nakato H. Sugiura M. Jannuzi A.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1829-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HSPGs generally are thought to regulate growth factor signaling on the surface of the signal-receiving cells (5Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). It has been reported, however, that HSPGs can regulate signaling in trans from neighboring cells in some cases (6Kramer K.L. Yost H.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Jakobsson L. Kreuger J. Holmborn K. Lundin L. Eriksson I. Kjellén L. Claesson-Welsh L. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that HSPGs are essential regulators of the GSC niche in the Drosophila ovary (8Hayashi Y. Kobayashi S. Nakato H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Guo Z. Wang Z. Development. 2009; 136: 3627-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although it has been well established that DPP regulates the asymmetric division of a GSC (10Xie T. Spradling A.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which this secreted molecule differentially regulates two daughter cells has been a mystery. We have found previously that DALLY, a Drosophila HSPG of the glypican type, is expressed specifically in the somatic niche cells (the cap cells) contacting GSCs and is required for GSC maintenance (8Hayashi Y. Kobayashi S. Nakato H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Ectopic dally expression in somatic cells in a wide region of the germarium was sufficient to maintain all the contacting germ line cells as GSC-like undifferentiated cells, thus expanding the GSC niche. One model that accounts for the spatially restricted activation of DPP signaling in the GSC niche of wild-type Germaria is that DALLY acts as a trans co-receptor of DPP and activates its signaling specifically in a directly contacting GSC. In this study, to validate our model and further explore the trans co-receptor function of HSPGs, we developed novel in vitro assay systems using Drosophila tissue culture S2 cells. These experimental systems demonstrated that DALLY serves as a trans co-receptor for DPP and enhances its signaling in a contact-dependent manner. This finding provides a mechanism, which defines the physical space of the niche by a coordinated action of BMPs and HSPGs. These assay systems also revealed some mechanistic aspects of BMP trans signaling. First, HS chains are critical for the trans co-receptor activity of DALLY. Second, we show that Glass bottom boat (GBB) and Dally-like protein (DLP) can also mediate signaling in trans. We observed ligand HSPG selectivity, which is consistent with previous in vivo observations. Third, DALLY shows biphasic activity; it up-regulates and down-regulates DPP signaling dependent on ligand concentration. Finally, DALLY immobilized on a slide glass disrupts DPP degradation in cells seeded on the DALLY-coated slide, suggesting that DALLY exerts enhanced activity of DPP signaling in trans by stabilizing DPP protein on the surface of the contacting cells. Thus, a combination of novel in vitro assays will provide us an opportunity to further explore the molecular mechanisms of contact-dependent BMP-HSPG signaling. The detailed information for fly strains used is described in Flybase. All flies were maintained at 25 °C. Oregon R and y w were used as a wild-type strain. dallygem and dallyΔP-527 were used as loss-of-function mutant alleles of dally (11Nakato H. Futch T.A. Selleck S.B. Development. 1995; 121: 3687-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For overexpression experiments, expression of UAS-dally-HA (12Tsuda M. Kamimura K. Nakato H. Archer M. Staatz W. Fox B. Humphrey M.

Selleck S.B. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was induced by apterous (ap)-Gal4. To construct split GFP (spGFP) expression plasmids, the corresponding regions of SpGFP1–10 and SpGFP11 were amplified by PCR from ace-4p::CD4-2::spGFP1-10 and rig-3p::CD4-2::spGFP11 plasmids (gifts from C. Bargmann; Ref. 14Feinberg E.H. Vanhoven M.K. Bendesky A. Wang G. Fetter R.D. Shen K. Bargmann C.I. Neuron. 2008; 57: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invotrogen). The inserts were recombined into the pAW destination vector. To construct pAW-HA-dpp and pAW-dally-myc, the corresponding regions were amplified by PCR from pBRAcpA-HA-dpp (15Akiyama T. Kamimura K. Firkus C. Takeo S. Shimmi O. Nakato H. Dev. Biol. 2008; 313: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and pBRAcpA-dally-myc (16Takeo S. Akiyama T. Firkus C. Aigaki T. Nakato H. Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 204-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), respectively. To construct pAW-dlp-myc, a Myc epitope tag sequence was inserted between Phe76 and Ser77 residues of DLP by fusion PCR. The PCR fragments for HA-dpp, dally-myc, and dlp-myc were cloned into a pDONR221 vector, and the inserts were recombined into a pAW destination vector. A cDNA clone for Mad-FLAG (17Shimmi O. Umulis D. Othmer H. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 2005; 120: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) were obtained from M. O'Connor. Drosophila S2 cells were obtained from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center. S2 cells were maintained in Schneider's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cell-based DPP signaling assay was performed as described previously (15Akiyama T. Kamimura K. Firkus C. Takeo S. Shimmi O. Nakato H. Dev. Biol. 2008; 313: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17Shimmi O. Umulis D. Othmer H. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 2005; 120: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), except that cells were transfected using Effectene transfection reagents (Qiagen) in serum-free Schneider's medium using a 12-well plate (1.2 ml of culture per well). S2 cells (1 × 106) were transfected with pAc-Mad-FLAG and pAW-dally-myc and incubated at 25 °C for 72 h. Control cells (without exogenous dally expression) were transfected with pAc5.1 empty vector (Invitrogen). DPP-containing conditioned medium was prepared from S2 cells expressing HA-dpp (transfected with pAW-HA-dpp 5 days before the experiment). Control conditioned medium was prepared in the same manner using cells transfected with pAc5.1. A recombinant DPP peptide (R&D Systems) was used to estimate the DPP amount in the conditioned media. The MAD-expressing cells were incubated with the conditioned medium with orbital shaking at 70 rpm. After incubation at 22 °C for 4 h, cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer. DPP signaling was assayed by immunoblot analysis using rabbit anti-pMAD antibody (EP823Y, 1:2000, Epitomics). Levels of total MAD protein were analyzed using mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2; 1:1500, Sigma) and used as an internal control. To confirm the specificity of DPP activity in the conditioned media, DPP-HA was depleted from the media using anti-HA antibody. An aliquot (200 μl) was collected into a siliconized tube and incubated with 0.2 μg of rat anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science, antibody 3F10) for 1 h at room temperature. DPP-HA was immunoprecipitated using protein G-conjugated Sepharose (Invitrogen). After immunoprecipitation, this DPP-HA-depleted conditioned medium was used for the signaling assay as described above. Control conditioned medium was prepared in the same manner using anti-Myc antibody. DNA transfection was performed as described in “DPP-DALLY Cis Signaling Assay.” To prepare the signal-receiving cells, S2 cells were transfected with pAc5.1 or pAc-Mad-FLAG. To prepare the signal-sending cells, S2 cells were transfected with pAc5.1 or pAW-HA-dpp, in combination with pAc5.1 or pAW-dally-myc. pAW-HA-gbb and pAW-dlp-myc were also used for experiments to test the activities of GBB and DLP. The sending and receiving cells were incubated separately at 25 °C for 72 h. After incubation, the cells were suspended in fresh serum-free Schneider's medium and further incubated at 22 °C for 1 h to minimize basal MAD phosphorylation. After the replacement with fresh serum-free medium, the sending and receiving cells (250 μl each) were co-cultured in a microcentrifuge tube at 22 °C for 4 h in an orbital shaking culture at 70 rpm. The cells were pelleted by a centrifugation at 200 × g, and the cell pellet was analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. The cells were prepared as described under “Immunoblot-based Trans Signaling Assay,” except that the sending and receiving cells were also transfected with pAW-spGFP1-10 and pAW-spGFP11, respectively. Co-culture was performed by mixing the sending and receiving cells (100 μl each) in an eight-well chamber slide (LabTek) coated with poly-l-lysine. After 4 h of static culture at 22 °C, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with anti-pMAD (EP823Y, 1:1000) and anti-FLAG (M2, 1:1000) antibodies. To examine the effect of heparin in the cis signaling assay, 5–500 ng/ml of heparin (Sigma) was added to the conditioned media. For the trans signaling assay, heparin was added at the start of co-culturing of the sending and receiving cells. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical assays were performed as described above. Templates for double-stranded RNA synthesis were prepared by PCR with gene-specific primers containing the T7 promoter sequence at the 5′ end. The regions corresponding to 1–710 bp of ttv (tout velu) cDNA, 411–922 bp (dally RNAi 1), and 1045 to 1498 bp (dally RNAi 2) of dally cDNA were targeted. Double-stranded RNA was synthesized using a Megascript Kit (Ambion). 500 ng of double-stranded RNA was introduced into the sending cells immediately after DNA transfection and subsequently every 24 h. DALLY was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc affinity gel (Sigma) from the conditioned medium of S2 cells expressing a Myc-tagged secreted form of DALLY (sec-dally-myc (16Takeo S. Akiyama T. Firkus C. Aigaki T. Nakato H. Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 204-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). The beads were washed once with 1 m NaCl and three times with PBS. DALLY was eluted with acid elution buffer (0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.8) followed by neutralization. Eight-well chamber slides were coated with DALLY by a standard technique (18Bunch T.A. Brower D.L. Development. 1992; 116: 239-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Maeda N. Noda M. Development. 1996; 122: 647-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mad-transfected cells (the receiving cells) prepared as in “Immunoblot-based Trans Signaling Assay” were seeded onto the DALLY-coated surface. After 5 h of incubation with conditioned medium containing DPP or GBB, pMAD levels were assayed by immunostaining as described above. A BSA-coated slide was used as a control. Changes in the level of pMAD after a pulse of DPP treatment was monitored as follows. S2 cells transfected with Mad-FLAG were treated with DPP-containing conditioned medium for 30 min. After the cells were washed with fresh Schneider's medium, the cells were incubated on a BSA- or DALLY-coated glass slide. The levels of pMAD throughout the time course (0–6 h after the DPP treatment) were monitored by immunoblotting using an anti-pMAD antibody. The cell-based DPP stability assay was performed as described previously (15Akiyama T. Kamimura K. Firkus C. Takeo S. Shimmi O. Nakato H. Dev. Biol. 2008; 313: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) except that the cells were cultured on a glass slide coated with BSA or DALLY-Myc. S2 cells were incubated with conditioned medium containing DPP for 30 min to allow DPP to bind onto the cell surface. After unbound DPP was washed off, the DPP-HA-bound cells were seeded onto a chamber slide coated with DALLY or BSA. The levels of DPP protein after a 6-h incubation on the coated surface were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody. Samples were examined on confocal laser scanning microscopes (Nikon C1 and Zeiss lsm710). Collected images were processed by Adobe Photoshop and analyzed by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). For pMAD signal quantification, cells expressing MAD-FLAG were selected and classified into three groups according to the intensity of pMAD staining; <50 (arbitrary units, not detected), 50–175 (weak), and >175 (strong). Cells expressing an extremely high level of MAD-FLAG were eliminated from the quantification analysis as they tend to show nonspecific pMAD background independent of BMP treatment. To examine the effect of DALLY expression on DPP signaling in vitro, we performed a cell-based signaling assay using Drosophila S2 cells (20Ross J.J. Shimmi O. Vilmos P. Petryk A. Kim H. Gaudenz K. Hermanson S. Ekker S.C. O'Connor M.B. Marsh J.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 21Shimmi O. O'Connor M.B. Development. 2003; 130: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DPP signaling activity was monitored by phosphorylation of MAD protein using an antibody against phospho-MAD (pMAD). Because endogenous levels of MAD protein in S2 cells are low, the cells were transfected with an epitope-tagged Mad cDNA (Mad-FLAG (20Ross J.J. Shimmi O. Vilmos P. Petryk A. Kim H. Gaudenz K. Hermanson S. Ekker S.C. O'Connor M.B. Marsh J.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar)). The DPP-containing conditioned medium was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that addition of relatively low levels of DPP (equivalent to 2 × 10−9 m of a recombinant DPP peptide, R&D Systems) to the culture medium can stimulate phosphorylation of MAD in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The depletion of DPP-HA from the conditioned medium by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody decreased pMAD levels (supplemental Fig. S2A). DPP signaling was restored by the addition of a purified DPP recombinant peptide (R&D Systems). These results confirmed that MAD phosphorylation is dependent on DPP contained in the conditioned media. We found that DPP-mediated MAD phosphorylation was enhanced greatly by co-expression of DALLY (Fig. 1A). Similarly, DALLY substantially enhanced MAD phosphorylation in the presence of purified DPP (supplemental Fig. S2B), confirming the specific activity of DALLY in DPP signaling. Altogether, these results showed that DALLY expression in the signal-receiving cells enhances DPP signaling, consistent with the previous in vivo data showing DALLY serves as a co-receptor for DPP (1Jackson S.M. Nakato H. Sugiura M. Jannuzi A. Oakes R. Kaluza V. Golden C. Selleck S.B. Development. 1997; 124: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fujise M. Takeo S. Kamimura K. Matsuo T. Aigaki T. Izumi S. Nakato H. Development. 2003; 130: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 3Belenkaya T.Y. Han C. Yan D. Opoka R.J. Khodoun M. Liu H. Lin X. Cell. 2004; 119: 231-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that high levels of ligand can bypass the requirement of HSPGs (22Häcker U. Lin X. Perrimon N. Development. 1997; 124: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, our previous study showed that a mutant form of DPP lacking the DALLY binding site was able to induce MAD phosphorylation in S2 cells when cells are treated with high doses of this mutant ligand (15Akiyama T. Kamimura K. Firkus C. Takeo S. Shimmi O. Nakato H. Dev. Biol. 2008; 313: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the current assay system, in which a lower dosage (physiological concentrations) of DPP ligand is used, the ligand stimulates signaling in a DALLY-dependent manner. The role of DALLY in DPP signaling under high ligand concentrations will be discussed later. By modifying the protocol described above, we next devised an assay system to evaluate the ability of DALLY to modulate DPP signaling in trans. We separately prepared “signal-receiving cells” that are transfected with a MAD cDNA, and “signal-sending cells” that are transfected with dpp and dally. Cells transfected with an empty vector plasmid (mock transfection for dpp or dally) were used as control sending cells. The sending and receiving cells were co-cultured at a density that allows the cells to contact each other. After 4 h of incubation, DPP signaling was assayed by immunoblotting using anti-pMAD antibody. Although the cell extracts were prepared from a mixture of the sending and receiving cells, the pMAD staining reflects DPP signaling specifically in the receiving cells because endogenous levels of MAD in the sending cells, which were not transfected with Mad, were negligible (supplemental Fig. S3). Using this assay system, we observed an increase in pMAD levels in the receiving cells by co-culturing with the dpp-expressing sending cells (Fig. 1B). Co-expression of dally in the sending cells substantially elevated pMAD levels, indicating a synergistic enhancement of DPP signaling. The dally-dependent up-regulation of DPP signaling provided evidence for the ability of DALLY to enhance DPP signaling in trans in S2 cells. We next asked how heparin affects DPP signaling in our assay systems. Addition of heparin to the nondiluted conditioned medium containing DPP-HA (1×) inhibited MAD phosphorylation in the cis signaling assay (supplemental Fig. S4A). DPP signaling in the presence of low levels of DPP-HA (0.1×) was enhanced strongly by DALLY (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S4A) but not by heparin. Instead, the increase of pMAD by DALLY was reversed by heparin treatment (supplemental Fig. S4A). We also observed that heparin inhibited DPP signaling in the trans signaling assay both in the presence and absence of exogenous DALLY. Thus, in both cis and trans assay systems, heparin shows an inhibitory effect on DPP signaling. In the immunoblot-based trans signaling assay system described above, the culture may exist as a mixed population where only a portion of receiving cells directly contact DALLY-expressing sending cells. To determine whether DPP and DALLY mediate signaling in a contact-dependent manner, it would be ideal to monitor signaling in a single cell that has (or does not have) this contact. Toward this purpose, we employed the spGFP system (14Feinberg E.H. Vanhoven M.K. Bendesky A. Wang G. Fetter R.D. Shen K. Bargmann C.I. Neuron. 2008; 57: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 23Ghosh I. Hamilton A.D. Regan L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5658-5659Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In this system, membrane contacts between two cells are detected by complementation of two split GFP proteins, spGFP1-10 and spGFP11. Previously, the membrane-bound forms of spGFP proteins have been used successfully to label membrane contact between two cells (14Feinberg E.H. Vanhoven M.K. Bendesky A. Wang G. Fetter R.D. Shen K. Bargmann C.I. Neuron. 2008; 57: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). To apply the spGFP system to Drosophila S2 cells, we subcloned the spGFP fragments into a S2 cell expression vector and transfected S2 cells with each construct. Fig. 1C shows that reconstitution of GFP specifically marks the interface of two contacting S2 cells. To analyze the contact dependence of the activity of DALLY, we separately prepared the receiving cells expressing Mad and the sending cells expressing dpp and dally, as described above. These cells were also transfected with each spGFP cDNA. Subsequently, the sending and receiving cells were co-cultured at a density in which some cells directly contact each other and others do not. We monitored in situ DPP signaling using anti-pMAD antibody in a single receiving cell and visualized its contact with a sending cell by spGFPs. Consistent with the results of the immunoblot-based trans signaling assay, DPP expression in the sending cells stimulated signaling in contacting receiving cells (Fig. 1, D and E). The pMAD levels in the receiving cells were further elevated by expression of dally in the sending cells (Fig. 1, D and E). In particular, the proportion of the receiving cells with high levels of pMAD were increased substantially by dally expression in the sending cells (Fig. 1E, dark gray portions of bar graphs). This enhancement was not observed in the absence of contact between the sending and receiving cells as revealed in GFP-negative cells (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, the single-cell DPP-HSPG trans signaling assay demonstrated that DALLY in trans potentiates DPP signaling in a contact-dependent manner. Together with the previously published in vivo analysis (8Hayashi Y. Kobayashi S. Nakato H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), these results establish the molecular basis for the contact-dependent control of the GSC niche. Establishment of the novel in vitro assay systems not only demonstrated the trans co-receptor activity of DALLY but also provided us with an opportunity to elucidate the molecular mechanism of BMP-HSPG trans signaling. One important question was whether HS modification is required for the function of DALLY as a trans co-receptor. Recent studies showed that glypicans retain an unexpected level of activity without modification by glycosaminoglycan sugar chain (24Kirkpatrick C.A. Knox S.M. Staatz W.D. Fox B. Lercher D.M. Selleck S.B. Dev. Biol. 2006; 300: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Yan D. Wu Y. Feng Y. Lin S.C. Lin X. Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 470-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of HS in DPP-DALLY trans signaling, we tested the effect of HS depletion from S2 cells. As we have shown above, the addition of the DPP ligand alone stimulates trans signaling in S2 cells. We assumed that this signaling is supported by endogenous HSPG molecules expressed by S2 cells. RNAi knockdown of ttv, which encodes an HS copolymerase, impaired HS modification of DALLY (supplemental Fig. S5A). In the immunoblot-based trans signaling assay, this treatment blocked the DALLY-dependent phosphorylation of MAD protein (Fig. 2, A and B). Consistent with this result, the single-cell assay also demonstrated that contact-dependent DPP signaling was impaired severely by the ttv RNAi treatment (Fig. 2, C and D). These observations suggested that trans enhancement of DPP signaling by DALLY requires its modification with HS. The effect of dally RNAi on DPP trans signaling also was examined. We observed a modest reduction in pMAD levels in both the immunoblot-based (supplemental Fig. S5B) and the single-cell trans signaling (supplemental Fig. S5C) assays. We have tested three different target sequences of dally mRNA, but the effect of dally RNAi in all three cases was not as strong as that of ttv. Because other HSPG core protein genes, including Syndecan (SDC), are expressed abundantly in S2 cells (26Kasevayuth K. Yanagishita M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the difference between the results of ttv and dally RNAi suggests that multiple endogenous HSPGs are involved redundantly in DPP signaling. Consistent with this idea, sdc RNAi treatment in the sending cells led to a reduction of pMAD levels (supplemental Fig. S5, B and C). We next asked whether this novel contact-dependent signaling is mediated by other BMP and/or HSPG molecules. For example, can another Drosophila BMP-like ligand, Glass bottom boat (GBB), also stimulate signaling in trans through HSPG co-receptors as shown for DPP? Is Dally-like protein (DLP), the second Drosophila glypican, able to serve as a trans co-receptor for these BMP ligands? To determine the relationship of the ligands and co-receptors in trans signaling activation, we assayed MAD phosphorylation using different combinations of the two BMP molecules, DPP and GBB, and the two glypicans, DALLY and DLP. Both immunoblot-based and single cell assays revealed that GBB can mediate signaling in trans like DPP (Fig. 3, A and C). Both DALLY and DLP synergistically enhanced GBB signaling (Fig. 3, A and C). On the other hand, DPP signaling was enhanced strongly by DALLY but not DLP (Fig. 3, A and B). This differential activity of the glypicans as a DPP co-receptor is consistent with previous in vivo observations that DALLY but not DLP can potentiate DPP signaling in the developing wing (Fig. 3D) (3Belenkaya T.Y. Han C. Yan D. Opoka R.J. Khodoun M. Liu H. Lin X. Cell. 2004; 119: 231-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, our in vitro assays reflect the activities and specificity that HSPG co-receptors show in vivo. In the developing wing, DPP is produced in a stripe of cells near the anterior-posterior compartment boundary and forms a concentration gradient throughout the wing disc. Thus, the DPP ligand concentration is high near the central region of the wing disc and low in the peripheral domains. We have previously reported that pMAD levels are extremely low in most parts of dally mutant discs (Fig. 4, A–C) (2Fujise M. Takeo S. Kamimura K. Matsuo T. Aigaki T. Izumi S. Nakato H. Development. 2003; 130: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the mutant discs show abnormally h"
https://openalex.org/W1990507930,"Muscleblind-like-1 (MBNL1) is a splicing regulatory factor controlling the fetal-to-adult alternative splicing transitions during vertebrate muscle development. Its capture by nuclear CUG expansions is one major cause for type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1). Alternative splicing produces MBNL1 isoforms that differ by the presence or absence of the exonic regions 3, 5, and 7. To understand better their respective roles and the consequences of the deregulation of their expression in DM1, here we studied the respective roles of MBNL1 alternative and constitutive exons. By combining genetics, molecular and cellular approaches, we found that (i) the exon 5 and 6 regions are both needed to control the nuclear localization of MBNL1; (ii) the exon 3 region strongly enhances the affinity of MBNL1 for its pre-mRNA target sites; (iii) the exon 3 and 6 regions are both required for the splicing regulatory activity, and this function is not enhanced by an exclusive nuclear localization of MBNL1; and finally (iv) the exon 7 region enhances MBNL1-MBNL1 dimerization properties. Consequently, the abnormally high inclusion of the exon 5 and 7 regions in DM1 is expected to enhance the potential of MBNL1 of being sequestered with nuclear CUG expansions, which provides new insight into DM1 pathophysiology.

IntroductionSplicing of pre-mRNA is a key post-transcriptional step in eukaryotic gene expression. A vast majority of vertebrate pre-mRNAs is alternatively spliced, allowing the production of several protein isoforms from transcripts of a given gene (1Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). The regulation of alternative splicing plays a major role in cell differentiation and in development and depends on the expression and activity of numerous splicing regulatory factors that are expressed differentially during development, according to the type of tissue. Defects in these alternative-splicing processes can contribute to pathogenesis, as demonstrated for a growing number of diseases, including neuromuscular diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) 9The abbreviations used are: DM1, myotonic dystrophy type 1; 3AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; BisTris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane; hcTNT, human cardiac troponin T; IR, insulin receptor; MBNL1, Muscleblind-like 1.

One of the main etiological hypotheses of DM1 is based on a toxic RNA gain of function, leading to the dysregulation of alternative splicing. Mutant transcripts bearing long-CUG repeats acquire unusual A-form double-stranded RNA structures (7Mooers B.H. Logue J.S. Berglund J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16626-16631Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), accumulate in the nucleus, and lead to small ribonucleoprotein inclusions, named foci (8Fardaei M. Larkin K. Brook J.D.

The alternative splicing of several MBNL1 targets is thus abnormally modified in DM1 patients and in a mouse model in which MBNL1 expression is inactivated (9Lin X. Miller J.W. Mankodi A.

In consequence, a loss-of-function mechanism has been proposed to contribute to DM1 pathogenesis, which is further supported by an in vivo model showing that MBNL1 inactivation leads to many of the symptoms and molecular defects observed in DM1 (10Kanadia R.N.

Originally identified in Drosophila melanogaster, MBNL1 is described as being essential for the terminal differentiation of photoreceptors and muscles (12Begemann G. Paricio N. Artero R. Kiss I.

In humans and in mice, the splicing factor MBNL1 has been shown to participate in the postnatal remodeling of skeletal muscle and of the developing heart by controlling the developmentally regulated switch of a key set of pre-mRNAs (9Lin X.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 2467-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and promotes either the inclusion or the exclusion of alternative exons depending on the 5′ or 3′ localization of cis-regulatory elements (17Goers E.S. Purcell J. Voelker R.B. Gates D.P. Berglund J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 2467-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For instance, the inclusion of exon 5 in human cardiac troponin T (hcTNT/TNNT2) mRNA is inhibited by MBNL1, whereas the inclusion of exon 11 in insulin receptor (IR/INSR) mRNA is promoted by MBNL1 (16Ho T.H. Charlet B.N. Poulos M.G. Singh G. Swanson M.S. Cooper T.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3103-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). MBNL1 binds to the polypyrimidine tract of hcTNT intron 4 and competes with the splicing factor U2AF for its binding site, explaining the MBNL1 inhibition of exon 5 inclusion (18Warf M.B. Diegel J.V. von Hippel P.H. Berglund J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9203-9208Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Conversely, by binding to elements located 3′ to the alternative exon 11 in IR pre-mRNA (IR/INSR), MBNL1 enhances the inclusion of this exon (17Goers E.S. Purcell J. Voelker R.B. Gates D.P. Berglund J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 2467-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Warf M.B. Berglund J.A. RNA. 2007; 13: 2238-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Sen S.

Differentiation. 2006; 74: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), some of which (exons 3, 5, 7, and 9) are alternatively spliced. Thus, >10 isoforms of MBNL1 have been reported (21Fardaei M. Rogers M.T. Thorpe H.M. Larkin K. Hamshere M.G. Harper P.S. Brook J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The expression of these isoforms is developmentally regulated and altered in DM1. These observations suggest a modulation of MBNL1 protein function through alternative splicing. Indeed, the cassette exons 5 and 7 are included mainly in fetal brain and muscle rather than in adult tissues and are preferentially included in DM1 patients compared with controls (9Lin X. Miller J.W. Mankodi A. Kanadia R.N. Yuan Y. Moxley R.T. Swanson M.S. Thornton C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 24Dhaenens C.M. Schraen-Maschke S.

Charlet-Berguerand N. Sablonnière B. Sergeant N. Exp. Neurol. 2008; 210: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Exons 1, 2, and 4 are always included and encode the four CCCH zinc finger domains involved in RNA binding (25Teplova M. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Exon 3 is often included and may act as a linker joining the second and third zinc finger domains (22Kino Y. Mori D. Oma Y. Takeshita Y. Sasagawa N. Ishiura S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 25Teplova M. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although the segment encoded by exon 3 is often included in MBNL1 protein, MBNL1 isoforms without this linker have already been found to have a lower affinity for CUG expansions compared with isoforms that include the exon 3-encoded sequence (22Kino Y. Mori D. Oma Y. Takeshita Y. Sasagawa N. Ishiura S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of the sequence encoded by exon 5 has been suggested to modulate the nuclear localization of MBNL1 (9Lin X. Miller J.W. Mankodi A. Kanadia R.N. Yuan Y. Moxley R.T. Swanson M.S. Thornton C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 15Terenzi F. Ladd A.N.

Neurol. 2008; 210: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the possible involvement of the bordering amino acid sequences encoded by constitutive exons such as exon 6 in the cellular localization of MBNL1 has not been investigated yet, and up to now, no functional role has been attributed to the highly conserved amino acid sequence encoded by exon 7 cassette, which is also mainly included in fetal brain and muscles and in MBNL1 protein from DM1 patients. It is therefore important to determine the relationship, if any, between the exon composition and function of MBNL1 isoforms.In the present study, in an effort to define precisely the respective roles of the amino acid sequences encoded by the alternative cassette exons 3, 5, and 7 and constitutive exon 6 of human MBNL1 protein isoforms, we applied a large variety of in vitro and in cellulo approaches. This allowed us to determine the cellular localization, splicing activity, and RNA binding properties of the eight main normal MBNL1 isoforms as well as of a large number of MBNL1 variant proteins. Experiments were performed using both HeLa cells and human myoblasts that did or did not express CUG expansions. Our results provide a better definition of (i) the respective roles of the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 3 and 5 in the RNA binding property, nuclear localization and splicing regulatory property of MBNL1; (ii) the involvement of the exon 6-encoded sequence in MBNL1 nuclear retention and in cellulo splicing regulatory activity; (iii) the identification of a possible role of the exon 7-encoded sequence in MBNL1 self-dimerization.DISCUSSIONAlternative splicing produces several MBNL1 isoforms, differing mainly in the inclusion or exclusion of the in-frame sequences encoded by exons 3, 5, and 7. The exon 3 region has already been proposed to modulate RNA binding affinity, and here we provide new information as to how the presence or absence of the exon 3 region modifies the binding of MBNL1 to its target sites in pre-mRNA and to CUG expansions. We show for the first time the crucial role of this region in the splicing regulatory property of MBNL1. The exon 5 region has previously been proposed to play a critical role in the nuclear retention of the MBNL1 protein. Here, we show that this nuclear retention also depends on amino acid sequences encoded by exon 6 and that the exon 6 region is required for splicing regulation. Finally, we have identified the role of the alternative exon 7 region in MBNL1 dimerization and showed also that exon 8 is alternative and not constitutive. We will now discuss the implications of our findings for the normal and pathological activities of the MBNL1 splicing factor.Nuclear Localization of MBNL1 and Splicing ActivityMBNL1 isoforms displayed different nucleocytoplasmic localization patterns in HeLa cells and in human myoblasts. Isoforms lacking the exon 5 region were distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm whereas the subcellular localization of those including the exon 5 region was restricted to the nucleus. Cassette exon 5 therefore probably encodes a region involved in the nuclear localization of MBNL1. This corroborates previously published data (9Lin X. Miller J.W. Mankodi A. Kanadia R.N. Yuan Y. Moxley R.T. Swanson M.S. Thornton C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 15Terenzi F. Ladd A.N. RNA Biol. 2010; 7: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Dhaenens C.M. Schraen-Maschke S. Tran H. Vingtdeux V. Ghanem D. Leroy O. Delplanque J. Vanbrussel E. Delacourte A. Vermersch P.

Neurol. 2008; 210: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and extends them to human myoblasts.Because all MBNL1 isoforms were located in the nucleus, with or without the inclusion of the alternative exon 5 region, we can rule out the idea that this region is solely driving the nuclear localization of MBNL1. This observation was further confirmed using truncated proteins with or without the exon 5 region and lacking the C-terminal region. Indeed, diffuse staining for the truncated proteins MBNL1ΔCT and MBNL1ΔCT5 was present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The apparent molecular size of these truncated proteins fused to the GFP tag was around 60 kDa, excluding passive diffusion through the nuclear pore complex. Thus, the RNA binding domain composed of four CCCH zinc finger motifs was sufficient to target MBNL1 to the nucleus. Furthermore, this result also suggests that the MBNL1 exon 5 region co-operates with another region to maintain MBNL1 in the nucleus. In line with our hypothesis, we observed that both exons 5 and 6 were required to induce a nuclear localization of MBNL1 exclusively, as seen in Fig. 2C. Interestingly, a new type of highly conserved nuclear localization signal motif (the KRAEK motif) has recently been identified in D. melanogaster Muscleblind-like C and E isoforms (33Fernandez-Costa J.M. Artero R. Mol. Cells. 2010; 30: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This motif has been shown to be sufficient to target Muscleblind-like to the nucleus of D. melanogaster Schneider 2 cells. Although this motif is conserved in the exon 6 region of human MBNL1, but not in exon 5, our data strongly suggest that additional regions might be required for MBNL1 nuclear retention. Thus, the nuclear retention of MBNL1, according to our results, necessitates a bipartite signal with one motif in the exon 5 and the second in the exon 6, but separately, these motifs are nonfunctional. We suggest that the MBNL1 exon 6 region contains a nuclear localization signal that is either functional in the presence of the exon 5 region or is regulated by an adjacent upstream sequence. Importantly, we cannot exclude the possibility that post-translational modification around the exon 5 sequence also regulates the subcellular localization of MBNL1.Because splicing occurs in the nucleus, we asked whether there was a relationship between strict nuclear localization and the splicing activity of MBNL1. Surprisingly, with a similar level of expression, we observed no difference in the splicing activity of the different MBNL1 isoforms on hcTNT exon 5 or IR exon 11 splicing, as assayed using minigenes. This result raises the question of the interest of a restrictive nuclear localization. One possibility is that nuclear retention is a cellular mechanism that impedes MBNL1 cytoplasmic activity while maintaining its splicing activity when located in the nucleus. Few studies have reported the potential cytoplasmic functions of MBNL1; judging by its similarity to MBNL2, another member of the MBNL protein family, MBNL1 could be involved in mRNA transport and/or stability (34Adereth Y. Dammai V. Kose N. Li R. Hsu T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In line with this observation, some recent studies have demonstrated a global change in gene expression in MBNL1 knock-out mice (11Du H. Cline M.S. Osborne R.J. Tuttle D.L. Clark T.A. Donohue J.P. Hall M.P. Shiue L. Swanson M.S. Thornton C.A. Ares Jr., M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 35Osborne R.J. Lin X. Welle S. Sobczak K. O'Rourke J.R. Swanson M.S. Thornton C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 1471-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Stability and translatability may also be regulated by MBNL1 under conditions of stress, in which MBNL1 co-localizes with stress granules (36Onishi H. Kino Y. Morita T. Futai E. Sasagawa N. Ishiura S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 1994-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this latter study, the authors used the isoform MBNL140, which displayed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization at base line. However, this property cannot be extrapolated to other isoforms of MBNL1, especially to MBNL1 isoforms having the exon 5 and 6 sequences. Additional work is needed to determine whether MBNL1 isoforms located only in the nucleus also co-localize with stress granules under conditions of stress. Accordingly, the function of MBNL1 isoforms lacking exon 3 also remains to be established.MBNL1 Splicing Activity Depends on Both Exon 3- and Exon 6-Encoded RegionsMBNL1 splicing factor can enhance or repress the inclusion of alternative exons (16Ho T.H. Charlet B.N. Poulos M.G. Singh G. Swanson M.S. Cooper T.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3103-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Based on our data, when an isoform is active in splicing, it can have a silencing or an enhancing activity on splicing, depending on the targeted splicing site. Our results exclude the possibility that some isoforms may be dedicated to splicing inhibition, whereas others would have splicing activation properties. As suggested previously, MBNL1 splicing activity might rather depend on the localization of its RNA-binding elements (17Goers E.S. Purcell J. Voelker R.B. Gates D.P. Berglund J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 2467-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Indeed, the MBNL1 exon 3 region is located between the zinc finger 2 and zinc finger 3 motifs and acts as a linker between the zinc finger 1/2 and zinc finger 3/4 domains that structure the MBNL1 RNA binding domain (22Kino Y. Mori D. Oma Y. Takeshita Y. Sasagawa N. Ishiura S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 25Teplova M. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and probably modulate its RNA binding affinity. Triple-hybrid assays and gel shift experiments confirmed that the presence of the exon 3 region was essential for MBNL1 efficient binding to its pre-mRNA target. Moreover, we observed that all MBNL1 isoforms that included the exon 3 region (MBNL140, MBNL141, MBNL142, and MBNL143) strongly modified MBNL1 splicing activity with respect to hcTNT exon 5 and IR exon 11, whereas those that lacked exon 3 (MBNL135, MBNL136, MBNL137, and MBNL138) barely did. Also in accordance with the need for an RNA binding domain for MBNL1 activity, experiments performed with a truncated protein revealed that the splicing activity of the exon 3 region was weak but accurate (Fig. 4, MBNL1ΔCT3). The recovery of full splicing activity was observed with proteins that expressed both the exon 3 and exon 6 regions (Fig. 4, MBNL1ΔCT3). This result suggests that MBNL1 splicing activity mainly resides in the exon 6 region. Furthermore, it also suggests that MBNL1 splicing activity likely depends on its affinity for its RNA targets and the presence of both exon 3 and 6 regions.Relevance to DM1 PathologyMyotonic dystrophy type 1 belongs to the triplet repeat disorder family. The unstable CTG expansions are transcribed into RNA and retained in the nucleus. These toxic RNAs have been shown to sequester MBNL1 proteins (8Fardaei M. Larkin K. Brook J.D. Hamshere M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2766-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 37Miller J.W. Urbinati C.R. Teng-Umnuay P. Stenberg M.G. Byrne B.J. Thornton C.A. Swanson M.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4439-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). There are various MBNL1 protein isoforms, which in our study differed in the presence or absence of the exon 3, 5, and 7 regions. All of them co-localized with the CUG repeats expressed in DM1 myoblasts. The MBNL1 RNA binding domain alone (MBNL1ΔCT, MBNL1ΔCT3) was sufficient to mediate MBNL1 binding to the CUG repeats, as previously suggested (19Warf M.B. Berglund J.A. RNA. 2007; 13: 2238-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), with or without the exon 3 region. Furthermore, using the yeast triple-hybrid system, we observed that the presence of the exon 3 region strongly enhanced the binding affinity of MBNL1 to the CUG repeats. Therefore, MBNL1 isoforms that lack the exon 3 region likely interact with CUG repeats very weakly. We thus suggest that their sequestration is not direct but mediated by the dimerization of MBNL1 with itself. The self-dimerization of MBNL1 has been previously reported and shown to occur via the C-terminal tail of MBNL1 (32Yuan Y. Compton S.A. Sobczak K. Stenberg M.G. Thornton C.A. Griffith J.D. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5474-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In our study, double-hybrid assays performed with the MBNL1 C-terminal tail revealed that these C-terminal fragments only dimerized with the full-length MBNL1. The presence of exon 7 also improved MBNL1 binding on both CUG repeats and hcTNT mRNA, most probably by promoting MBNL1 dimerization. Interestingly, the expression of MBNL1 protein isoforms, including the exon 7, region is greatly increased with the development of DM1 (9Lin X. Miller J.W. Mankodi A. Kanadia R.N. Yuan Y. Moxley R.T. Swanson M.S. Thornton C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 24Dhaenens C.M. Schraen-Maschke S. Tran H. Vingtdeux V. Ghanem D. Leroy O. Delplanque J. Vanbrussel E. Delacourte A. Vermersch P. Maurage C.A. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. Mahadevan M.S. Ishiura S. Buée L. Cooper T.A. Caillet-Boudin M.L. Charlet-Berguerand N. Sablonnière B. Sergeant N. Exp. Neurol. 2008; 210: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These isoforms could therefore contribute to the focal localization of all MBNL1 isoforms, with or without the exon 3 region. Altogether, our results suggest that the binding of MBNL1 proteins to the CUG repeats could either be direct or indirect, through the dimerization of MBNL1 with itself. Thus, the MBNL1 missplicing observed in DM1 could enhance its own sequestration in the foci.CONCLUSIONAltogether, our study reveals the importance of the alternative splicing of MBNL1 in the post-transcriptional regulation of the subcellular localization and function of MBNL1. We attempted to understand better the function of the various MBNL1 isoforms. Our results show that (i) the presence of the exon 3 region is essential to ensure a high binding affinity of MBNL1 for pre-mRNA, and thus its splicing activity; (ii) the presence of the exon 5 region ensures a restrictive nuclear localization; (iii) exons 3 and 5 are fully functional only in the presence of the exon 6 region; and (iv) the exon 7 region modulates the dimerization properties of MBNL1. Our data therefore indicate that association of MBNL1 with CUG repeats depends both on RNA-protein interactions and on self-dimerization. During fetal development and in DM1 pathophysiology, both MBNL1 exons 5 and 7 are included. This could contribute to the exclusively nuclear localization of MBNL1 and to its self-dimerization, two key features for the sequestration within foci. However, further studies will be needed for a better understanding of all the molecular consequences of MBNL1 sequestration in DM1. This knowledge is important to define precisely the mechanism for a potential therapeutic development. IntroductionSplicing of pre-mRNA is a key post-transcriptional step in eukaryotic gene expression. A vast majority of vertebrate pre-mRNAs is alternatively spliced, allowing the production of several protein isoforms from transcripts of a given gene (1Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). The regulation of alternative splicing plays a major role in cell differentiation and in development and depends on the expression and activity of numerous splicing regulatory factors that are expressed differentially during development, according to the type of tissue. Defects in these alternative-splicing processes can contribute to pathogenesis, as demonstrated for a growing number of diseases, including neuromuscular diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) 9The abbreviations used are: DM1, myotonic dystrophy type 1; 3AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; BisTris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane; hcTNT, human cardiac troponin T; IR, insulin receptor; MBNL1, Muscleblind-like 1.

https://openalex.org/W2014221947,"RhoA, the founding member of mammalian Rho GTPase family, is thought to be essential for actomyosin regulation. To date, the physiologic function of RhoA in mammalian cell regulation has yet to be determined genetically. Here we have created RhoA conditional knock-out mice. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deleted of RhoA showed no significant change in actin stress fiber or focal adhesion complex formation in response to serum or LPA, nor any detectable change in Rho-kinase signaling activity. Concomitant knock-out or knockdown of RhoB and RhoC in the RhoA(-/-) cells resulted in a loss of actin stress fiber and focal adhesion similar to that of C3 toxin treatment. Proliferation of RhoA(-/-) cells was impaired due to a complete cell cycle block during mitosis, an effect that is associated with defective cytokinesis and chromosome segregation and can be readily rescued by exogenous expression of RhoA. Furthermore, RhoA deletion did not affect the transcriptional activity of Stat3, NFκB, or serum response factor, nor the expression of the cell division kinase inhibitor p21(Cip)1 or p27(Kip1). These genetic results demonstrate that in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, RhoA is uniquely required for cell mitosis but is redundant with related RhoB and RhoC GTPases in actomyosin regulation."

However, on the other hand, ECM remodeling can lead to fibrosis and decreased ventricular compliance. The small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP), biglycan (bgn), has been shown to be critically involved in these processes. During post-infarct remodeling cardiac fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts which are the main cell type mediating ECM remodeling. The aim of the present study was to characterize the role of bgn in modulating the phenotype of cardiac fibroblasts. Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from hearts of wild-type (WT) versus bgn−/0 mice. Phenotypic characterization of the bgn−/0 fibroblasts revealed increased proliferation. Importantly, this phenotype of bgn−/0 fibroblasts was abolished to the WT level by reconstitution of biglycan in the ECM. TGF-β receptor II expression and phosphorylation of SMAD2 were increased. Furthermore, indicative of a myofibroblast phenotype bgn−/0 fibroblasts were characterized by increased α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) incorporated into stress fibers, increased formation of focal adhesions, and increased contraction of collagen gels. Administration of neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β reversed the pro-proliferative, myofibroblastic phenotype. In vivo post-MI α-SMA, TGF-β receptor II expression, and SMAD2 phosphorylation were markedly increased in bgn−/0 mice.

The N-terminal domain harbors a highly conserved HHCC zinc binding motif that contributes to IN multimerization and enzymatic activities. The central core domain contains the catalytic DDE motif that is conserved in all retroviral and retrotransposon INs and in certain bacterial transposases. The C-terminal domain is the least conserved among retroviral IN and binds DNA nonspecifically (for reviews, see Refs. 1Craigie R. J. Biol.

Post-translational modifications contribute to the regulation of IN activities. HIV-1 IN interacts with and is acetylated by both histone acetyltransferases p300 and GCN5 on C-terminal lysine residues (22Cereseto A. Manganaro L. Gutierrez M.I. Terreni M. Fittipaldi A. Lusic M.

Acetylation increases IN affinity for the viral cDNA, enhances its strand transfer activity in vitro, and might regulate the interaction between IN and cellular factors (24Allouch A. Cereseto A. Amino Acids. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of this modification during HIV-1 replication is still controversial (25Topper M. Luo Y. Zhadina M. Mohammed K. Smith L. Muesing M.A. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3012-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HIV-1 IN is also ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome (26Mousnier A. Kubat N. Massias-Simon A. Ségéral E. Rain J.C. Benarous R. Emiliani S. Dargemont C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13615-13620Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Mulder L.C.

Recently, phosphorylation of HIV-1 IN by cellular JNK has also been proposed to modulate its stability and to be necessary for efficient integration (31Manganaro L. Lusic M. Gutierrez M.I. Cereseto A. Del Sal G. Giacca M. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SUMOylation consists of the covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) peptides to a Lys residue within the consensus motif (ΨKX(E/D), where Ψ is a large hydrophobic residue) of a substrate protein. SUMO conjugation is mediated by SUMO-specific E1-activating, E2-conjugating, and E3-ligating enzymes and is reversed by SUMO-specific proteases (reviewed in Ref. 32Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). In mammals, three major forms of SUMO proteins are expressed. SUMO-1 has ∼45% amino acid sequence homology to SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, which are 96% identical to each other. SUMO modification is implicated in numerous cellular processes, including signal transduction, protein stability and localization, transcriptional regulation, chromatin structure, and genome stability (32Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). It is also well established that viruses interfere with and/or hijack the cellular SUMOylation machinery to replicate (for reviews, see Refs. 33Boggio R. Chiocca S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and 34Wilson V.G. Rangasamy D. Virus Res. 2001; 81: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interactions between murine leukemia virus capsid (CA) protein and components of the SUMOylation pathway are required for proper execution of the early steps of replication after reverse transcription but before integration (35Yueh A. Leung J. Bhattacharyya S. Perrone L.A. de los Santos K. Pu S.Y. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). SUMOylation events have also been implicated in the early phase of HIV-1 infection. Indeed, SUMO-2 and RanBP2 (Ran-binding protein 2), a SUMO E3 ligase, were identified in genome-wide screens for cell factors that promote HIV-1 reverse transcription and PIC nuclear import, respectively (36König R.

Interaction of HIV-1 or Mason-Pfitzer monkey virus Gag proteins with SUMO-1 and the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 during the late phases of replication have also been reported and are probably involved in the production of fully infectious virions (38Gurer C.

Here, we show that HIV-1 IN is SUMOylated and that three Lys residues, which are found within conserved consensus motifs, represent the major SUMO acceptor sites. In the viral context, mutation of SUMO acceptor residues in IN led to reduced infectivity and slower replication kinetics. Biogenesis, release, and reverse transcription steps of mutant HIV-1 particles were not affected. However, cells infected with viruses harboring SUMOylation-defective IN mutants showed a significant decrease in integration events compared with HIV-1WT-infected cells. Because SUMOylation-site IN mutants retained WT catalytic activity, we inferred that modification by SUMO might participate in the modulation of the HIV-1 IN interaction network by regulating its affinity for co-factors, which are required for the efficient execution of early events of HIV-1 replication. HeLa and 293T cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen). CEM-GFP cells (AIDS Reagent Program), a human T cell line harboring the GFP reporter gene under the control of HIV-1 LTR (42Gervaix A. West D.

The cDNA encoding the C-terminal region of LEDGF/p75 (amino acids 325–530) was amplified by PCR from WT and D366N mutant HA-LEDGF/p75 (46Cherepanov P. Sun Z.Y. Rahman S. Maertens G. Wagner G. Engelman A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To produce IN mutants, changes were introduced by PCR into the IN sequence of the suitable plasmid using the Expand Long Templates PCR System (Roche Applied Science). The entire recombinant IN coding fragment was confirmed by sequencing and swapped for the corresponding WT fragment into the appropriate recipient vector. Bacterially expressed His-tagged full-length IN, N-terminal (INΔN, encoding amino acids 50–288) or C-terminal (INΔC, encoding amino acids 1–213) truncation forms (47Carayon K. Leh H. Henry E. Simon F. Mouscadet J.F. Deprez E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3692-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and IN3KR mutant were purified as described previously (48Leh H. Brodin P.

Next, recombinant His-tagged full-length or mutant IN proteins (200 nm) were used to perform an in vitro assay with the SUMOylation kit (BIOMOL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293T cells (3 × 106) were seeded into 10-cm dishes and transfected 24 h later using a calcium phosphate precipitation technique with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged WT or mutant IN proteins and vectors expressing Ubc9 and His-SUMO-1, -2, or -3 or an appropriate empty vector. After 40 h, cells were lysed under denaturing conditions in buffer A (6 m guanidium HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and sonicated (10 cycles, 40-s pulse, 15-s pause with the BioruptorTM (Diagenode)). Cell lysates were incubated with nickel-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) (3 h, room temperature) and next extensively washed with decreasing amounts of guanidium HCl. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer with 200 mm imidazole and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Tagged proteins were probed for by Western blot. For indirect immunostaining, HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with Polyfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min, 4 °C), permeabilized with ice-cold methanol (5 min, 4 °C), and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-Fluor488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Images were acquired on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM510 Meta; Carl Zeiss) equipped with an Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope, using a Plan Apo 63/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. For fractionation experiments, 293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged WT, 3KR, or 3EQ IN were lysed in buffer C (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% CHAPS, EDTA-free complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) (30 min, 4 °C). Supernatant (cytosol) and pellet (nuclei) were separated by centrifugation (top speed, 5 min, 4 °C). Nuclear content was extracted in buffer N (buffer C with 0.85 m NaCl final) (30 min, 4 °C). For IN stability studies, cycloheximide (100 μg/ml; Sigma) or MG132 (5 μm; Calbiochem) were added to the culture medium 24 h after transfection. Next, cells were lysed in buffer N. Total protein content was measured with a Bradford assay (Sigma). Proteins (25 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot. Single-round viruses were produced by co-transfection of 293T cells using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation technique with a plasmid encoding WT or mutant HIV-1-packaging DNA (psPAX2) and the genomic transfer vector encoding GFP (pWPI) or the pNL4–3EnvFsGFP vector and an expression vector for the glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVg) (pMD2.G). Replication-competent viruses were produced by transfecting the pNL4-3 plasmid that encodes a complete HIV-1 infectious provirus. Supernatants were collected 40 h post-transfection, clarified by low speed centrifugation, filtered through 0.45-μm pore size filters, and treated with 10 units/ml Turbo DNase (Ambion) (1 h, room temperature). Viral particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation (24,000 rpm, 1 h 30 min, 4 °C) using a SW32 rotor (Beckman) on a 20% sucrose cushion. All viral stocks were normalized for the p24CA antigen content, as determined by ELISA (Zeptometrix) and used to infect target cells (6 × 104 293T or 1 × 106 CEM-GFP cells). After 48 h, the percentage of GFP-expressing cells was measured by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Viral proteins associated with virions or with infected cells were analyzed by Western blot with anti-CA and anti-IN antibodies. For quantification of virion-associated CA and IN proteins, secondary antibodies coupled with IRDye near infrared dyes (IRDye800CW and IRDye680LT, Science Tec) were used. Proteins were visualized on an Odyssey infrared imager and quantified with Odyssey software (LI-COR Biosciences). Total genomic DNA was extracted using a blood and body fluid kit (Qiagen) from 293T cells (5 × 105) infected with single-round viruses. Full-length reverse transcripts, integrated HIV-1 DNA, and 2-LTR circles were quantified using a previously described protocol (49Brussel A. Sonigo P. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11263-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Parallel infections with heat-inactivated HIV-1WT viruses were performed to control for residual levels of plasmid DNA that may have resisted DNase treatment. Viral RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and amplified with the HIV-1 real time RT-PCR kit (BioEvolution). Real-time PCR and RT-PCR were performed on a Lightcycler 1.0 (Roche Applied Science). Viral stocks generated by co-transfecting 293T cells with pNLX.Luc(R-Env−), pRL2P-Vpr-IN WT or mutant, and pNLXE7 were used to infect Jurkat cells (2 × 106 cells/ml, 5 × 105 reverse transcriptase cpm), as described (50Lu R. Limón A. Ghory H.Z. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2493-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after infection and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Frozen and thawed lysates were clarified by centrifugation (18,730 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and supernatants were analyzed for luciferase activity in duplicate using the Promega luciferase assay system, an EG&G Berthold Microplate LB 96V luminometer, and a Microlite 1 flat bottom microtiter plate (Thermo Labsystems). Luciferase activity was normalized to the protein concentration as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and corrected for background levels from lysates of cells infected with Env-negative controls. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged WT or 3KR or 3EQ IN and WT or D366N HA-LEDGF/p75Cter. The immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described (46Cherepanov P. Sun Z.Y. Rahman S. Maertens G. Wagner G. Engelman A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Briefly, precleared cell extracts were incubated with HA.11 affinity matrix (Covance) (3 h, 4 °C). Following extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer. Cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot. Pairwise comparison between groups was performed using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was set as a threshold for statistical significance. By analyzing HIV-1 IN sequences, we identified three Lys residues at positions 46, 136, and 244 (HXB2 numbering scheme) within canonical SUMOylation consensus motifs, which represent potential sites for modification by SUMO (SUMOplot; SUMO sp 2.0 (51Xue Y. Zhou F. Fu C. Xu Y. Yao X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W254-W257Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). SUMO consensus motifs harboring Lys46 and Lys244 are conserved in HIV-2, SIVcpz, and SIVmac (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1), whereas the SUMO consensus harboring K136 is found in about one-third of HIV-1 strains (52Kuiken C.L. Foley B. Freed E. Hahn B. Korber P.A. Marx F. McCutchan J.W. Wolinksy S. HIV Sequence Compendium 2002. Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM2002Crossref Google Scholar). The extent of conservation of these motifs prompted us to assess whether HIV-1 IN is post-translationally modified by SUMO proteins. With this aim, we performed an in vitro SUMOylation assay. Slow migrating bands reactive to an antibody against IN were observed when purified recombinant IN bearing an N-terminal His6 tag was incubated with components of the SUMOylation machinery in the presence but not in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 1 and 2). The appearance of several high molecular weight species indicates the addition of multiple SUMO moieties to IN. Of note, similar levels of modification but slightly different patterns of conjugation by SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3 were observed when IN was incubated in the presence of each SUMO protein separately (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5). Because putative SUMO attachment sites localize to each IN functional domain, we examined the modification of IN mutants in which the N-terminal or the C-terminal region was deleted. SUMOylated species were observed when INΔC was subject to the in vitro SUMOylation reaction (Fig. 1C), whereas modified forms of INΔN could not be detected, probably due to technical limits (absence of the epitope or low affinity of the antibodies used) (data not shown). To confirm that sites identified in silico are SUMOylated, we simultaneously replaced Lys residues at positions 46, 136, and 244 by Arg, an amino acid with similar positive charge that cannot be modified by SUMO, into the His-IN plasmid. The resulting triple IN mutant (IN3KR) was then tested in the in vitro SUMOylation assay. Under these settings, conjugation of SUMO to IN3KR was dramatically decreased compared with INWT (Fig. 1D). Altogether, these results show that HIV-1 IN is modified with similar efficiency, but with slightly different specificity, by the three SUMO paralogues on candidate consensus sites in vitro. Because we found that HIV-1 IN is covalently modified by SUMO proteins in vitro, we next assessed SUMO conjugation in a cellular context. With this aim, 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding HIV-1 IN bearing a C-terminal FLAG tag (INWT-FLAG) and expression vectors for Ubc9 and for N-terminal His-tagged SUMO-1, -2 or -3 or the appropriate control empty vector. Forty hours after transfection, purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography in highly denaturing conditions was performed to ensure that only molecules covalently linked to IN were recovered and that the activity of SUMO proteases was blocked. Although IN expression levels were comparable in all samples (Fig. 2A, bottom, lanes 1–4), modified species reactive to an anti-IN antibody and migrating at the size expected for IN conjugated to one (∼36 + 12 = 48 kDa) or several SUMO moieties, were observed when SUMO-1, -2, or -3 was expressed but not in the control (Fig. 2A, top, lanes 1–4). Because Lys-to-Arg changes at positions 46, 136, and 244 lead to a drastic reduction of IN SUMOylation in vitro, the same mutations were introduced into the INWT-FLAG plasmid. Candidate SUMOylation sites were disrupted either individually or in various combinations, and modified IN derivatives were analyzed as described above. Single and double mutant IN proteins displayed SUMOylation profiles analogous to INWT (data not shown) (supplemental Fig. S2). As expected, the enrichment of modified forms of IN3KR, which was expressed at levels similar to INWT, was considerably diminished regardless of the SUMO protein expressed (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 5–8 with lanes 1–4). We also generated an IN mutant in which the Glu residues at positions 48, 138, and 246 were substituted by Gln, yielding the IN3EQ mutant. Indeed, the acidic amino acid (Glu/Asp) at +2 of the SUMOylation consensus motifs is indispensable for SUMO conjugation to Lys (53Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In agreement with the results obtained with IN3KR, the SUMO-modified species of IN3EQ were much less abundant compared with that of INWT (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 9–12 with lanes 1–4). To evaluate whether disruption of IN SUMOylation motifs affected other post-translational modifications targeting Lys residues, FLAG-tagged WT or mutant IN proteins were expressed together with His-tagged ubiquitin in 293T cells, and purification in denaturing conditions was performed. Both IN3KR and IN3EQ displayed ubiquitination profiles similar to INWT, demonstrating that Lys-to-Arg or Glu-to-Gln changes specifically impaired SUMOylation but not ubiquitination (Fig. 2B). Finally, we analyzed conjugation of endogenous SUMO proteins to ectopically expressed IN. Thus, we generated plasmids encoding WT or 3KR IN with an N-terminal His6 tag that were used to transfect 293T cells, followed by affinity purification in denaturing conditions. Post-translational derivatives of IN enriched on nickel-NTA beads were detected with an anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody in the presence, but not in the absence, of INWT expression (Fig. 2C, top, lane 2). Under the same settings, weak but specific bands were also detected with an antibody against SUMO-1 (Fig. 2C, middle, lane 2). However, although IN3KR was expressed at levels similar to INWT (Fig. 2C, bottom, compare lanes 2 and 3), corresponding SUMO-1- and SUMO-2/3-modified forms were significantly reduced (Fig. 2C, top and middle). Analysis of acetylation and ubiquitination of WT and 3KR IN under the same settings showed that both proteins were modified to a similar extent (Fig. 2D) (data not shown). Altogether, these results confirm that HIV-1 IN is modified by the SUMO paralogues in vivo and that conserved Lys residues at positions 46, 136, and 244 are the principal sites of SUMOylation. Moreover, these data indicate that candidate SUMOylation sites are not targeted by ubiquitination or acetylation. SUMOylation has been shown to regulate numerous cellular processes, including protein localization and stability (32Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). First, the involvement of SUMO conjugation in HIV-1 IN subcellular distribution was studied by expressing FLAG-tagged WT or mutant IN proteins in HeLa cells, followed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis. As already established, INWT was enriched in the nucleus of transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Likewise, IN3KR and IN3EQ concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). A similar distribution was also observed upon analysis of the steady state nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of FLAG-tagged INWT, IN3KR, or IN3EQ expressed in 293T cells by cell fractionation followed by Western blot with an anti-IN antibody. The proper separation of the nuclear and the cytoplasmic fraction was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies against the cytoplasmic protein LDH or the nuclear histone H2B, showing no detectable cross-contamination (Fig. 3B). Second, to investigate the involvement of SUMOylation on IN stability, we studied the half-life of INWT, IN3KR, and IN3EQ"

Thus, targeting mutant p53 for degradation might be explored as a therapeutic strategy to manage tumors that are addicted to mutant p53 for survival. Arsenic trioxide, a drug for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, is found to target and degrade a class of proteins with high levels of cysteine residues and vicinal thiol groups, such as promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and PML-retinoic acid receptor α fusion protein. Interestingly, wild type p53 is accumulated in cells treated with arsenic compounds, presumably due to arsenic-induced oxidative stresses. In this study, we found that wild type p53 is induced by arsenic trioxide in tumor cells, consistent with published studies. In contrast, we found that arsenic compounds degrade both endogenous and ectopically expressed mutant p53 in time- and dose-dependent manners. We also found that arsenic trioxide decreases the stability of mutant p53 protein through a proteasomal pathway, and blockage of mutant p53 nuclear export can alleviate the arsenic-induced mutant p53 degradation. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of mutant p53 desensitizes, tumor cells to arsenic treatment. Taken together, we found that mutant p53 is a target of arsenic compounds, which provides an insight into exploring arsenic compound-based therapy for tumors harboring a mutant p53."

https://openalex.org/W2057791419,"Peroxidation of plasma lipoproteins has been implicated in the endothelial cell activation and monocyte adhesion that initiate atherosclerosis, but the exact mechanisms underlying this activation remain unclear. Lipid peroxidation generates lipid aldehydes, including the γ-ketoaldehydes (γKA), also termed isoketals or isolevuglandins, that readily modify the amine headgroup of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). We hypothesized that aldehyde modification of PE could mediate some of the proinflammatory effects of lipid peroxidation. We found that PE modified by γKA (γKA-PE) induced THP-1 monocyte adhesion to human umbilical cord endothelial cells. γKA-PE also induced expression of adhesion molecules and increased MCP-1 and IL-8 mRNA in human umbilical cord endothelial cells. To determine the structural requirements for γKA-PE activity, we tested several related compounds. PE modified by 4-oxo-pentanal induced THP-1 adhesion, but N-glutaroyl-PE and C18:0N-acyl-PE did not, suggesting that an N-pyrrole moiety was essential for cellular activity. As the N-pyrrole headgroup might distort the membrane, we tested the effect of the pyrrole-PEs on membrane parameters. γKA-PE and 4-oxo-pentanal significantly reduced the temperature for the liquid crystalline to hexagonal phase transition in artificial bilayers, suggesting that these pyrrole-PE markedly altered membrane curvature. Additionally, fluorescently labeled γKA-PE rapidly internalized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); γKA-PE induced C/EBP homologous protein CHOP and BiP expression and p38 MAPK activity, and inhibitors of ER stress reduced γKA-PE-induced C/EBP homologous protein CHOP and BiP expression as well as EC activation, consistent with γKA-PE inducing ER stress responses that have been previously linked to inflammatory chemokine expression.

Of particular interest in this regard is our recent finding that treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with 15-E2-isoketal, one of the major γKA regioisomers, generated more modified PE (γKA-PE) than modified protein (17Sullivan C.B.

Aldehyde-modified PEs, including γKA-PE, are formed in significant amounts in biological systems during oxidative stress. For instance, N-pyrrole-modified PEs (which could arise from reaction of a number of different lipid aldehydes with PE, including γKA) were detected by Ehrlich assay in HDL oxidized in vitro (20Hidalgo F.J. Nogales F. Zamora R. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 334: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Treatment with arachidonic acid, which induces oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, significantly elevates levels of γKA-PE in cultured endothelial cells (21Guo L. Amarnath V. Davies S.S. Anal. Biochem. 2010; 405: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Chronic ethanol exposure, a well characterized inducer of lipid peroxidation in vivo, significantly increases plasma levels of γKA-PEs (18Li W. Laird J.M. Lu L. Roychowdhury S. Nagy L.E. Zhou R. Crabb J.W. Salomon R.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1539-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Plasma levels of γKA-PE are also increased in macular degeneration (18Li W. Laird J.M.

Although these studies indicate that the lipid aldehydes do indeed modify PE in vivo, they do not provide any insight as to whether modification of PE contributes to the proinflammatory activities of lipid aldehydes. We therefore examined whether γKA-PE could induce proinflammatory effects using a cell culture model of inflammation, THP-1 monocyte adhesion to HUVEC. We then examined the structural requirements for HUVEC activation by γKA-PE and related aldehyde-modified PEs and their effects on membrane bilayer properties. We also assessed the localization of γKA-PE and examined potential mechanisms of cell signaling. These studies suggest that γKA-PE and related pyrrole-PEs are an important new class of proinflammatory mediators that induce their effects through localization to the ER, alteration of membrane curvature, and activation of ER stress signaling pathways. 1,2-Dipalmitoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DiPoPE), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (LPE), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(glutaryl) (C16:0 glutaryl-PE (glt-PE)), and 1-palmitoyl-2-{12-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]lauroyl}-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (NBD-PE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

Biochem. 2010; 405: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). γKA-LPE was prepared in a similar manner as γKA-PE except that LPE was used in place of DPPE. To study γKA-PE on membrane parameters, a large scale reaction mixture (100 ml) was concentrated under N2 and further purified by HPLC. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (60:20:20 methanol, acetonitrile, 1 mm ammonium acetate) and solvent B (1 mm ammonium acetate in EtOH). The lipids were chromatographed on a Prevail C18 5u (250 × 4.6-mm) column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) with a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. After a 2-min hold at 20% solvent B, the solvent was gradient ramped to 100% B over 10 min, held at 100% B for 8 min, and returned to 20% B over 5 min and then held for 5 min before the next injection. The fractions containing γKA-PE were identified by negative ion LC/MS analysis (m/z 1006.7) and combined. The concentration of final product was determined by parent scan of m/z 255 in negative ion LC/MS with C17:0N-acyl-PE (m/z 942.7) as the internal standard. C17:0N-acyl-PE, as well as C18:0N-acyl-PE (NAPE, m/z 956.7), were prepared as described previously (21Guo L. Amarnath V. Davies S.S. Anal. Biochem. 2010; 405: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). γKA-NBD-PE was prepared following the same procedure as γKA-PE except NBD-PE was used instead of PE. Excess NBD-PE was removed after reaction using the same HPLC purification method above except that the final product γKA-NBD-PE was quantified by fluorescence using the starting material as reference. 4-Oxo-pentanal (OPA) was prepared as described previously by organic synthesis (23Amarnath V. Amarnath K. Amarnath K. Davies S. Roberts 2nd., L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). OPA-PE was prepared from OPA and DPPE following the same procedure as γKA-PE. The HPLC fractions containing OPA-PE were identified by negative ion LC/MS analysis (m/z 754) and combined. HUVEC obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured in endothelial basal growth medium-2 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 2% FBS, 0.4% human FGF-B, 0.1% VEGF, 0.1% recombinant long R insulin-like growth factor-B, 0.1% human epidermal growth factor, 0.1% gentamicin sulfate, 0.04% hydrocortisone, 0.1% ascorbic acid, and 0.1% heparin. Cells from passage 6 were used in this study. THP-1 cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 25 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, l-glutamine, and 50 μmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol. Stimulation solutions of γKA-PE and its analogs were prepared from stock solutions of each N-modified PE by evaporating off the organic solvent to dryness, redissolving the N-modified PEs in ethanol, diluting to the appropriate concentration using HBSS or DMEM containing 0.1% human serum albumin (HSA), and then sonicating the solution in a water bath sonicator. The final concentration of ethanol was 0.5% or less in all stimulation solutions. Because γKA reacts with the primary amines and is soluble in 0.5% ethanol without the use of HSA, for adhesion assays comparing the potency of γKA with γKA-PE and its analogs, we omitted 0.1% HSA from experiments where γKA itself was tested and used HBSS, rather than DMEM, because DMEM contains amino acids. HUVEC (passage 6) were seeded on 0.1% gelatin-coated 96-well culture plates and cultured to 80–90% confluence. Cells were washed with HBSS three times and incubated with vehicle (negative control), LPS (positive control), or the test compound in HBSS at 37 °C for 4 h. The media were removed, and HUVEC cells were washed with HBSS three times prior to adding 100 μl of calcein-labeled THP-1 cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Calcein-labeled THP-1 cells were prepared by incubation with 4 μg/ml calcein acetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min; excess label was removed by washing three times, and the THP-1 were resuspended in HBSS at 5 × 106 cell/ml. Nonadherent THP-1 cells were removed from HUVEC by gently washing with PBS twice, and the fluorescence of HUVEC-bound THP-1 cells was measured (494 excitation/520 emission). The extent of treatment-induced adhesion for each well was normalized to increase over basal fluorescence in vehicle-treated wells induced by 10 μg/ml LPS. For each compound, a minimum of three separate experiments with five replicate wells per experiment were performed. To determine the solubility of γKA-PE and its analogs in stimulation solutions used for cultured cell experiments, we prepared solutions containing 1 μm each of γKA-PE, C18:0-N-acyl-PE, OPA-PE, and glt-PE in either methanol/chloroform (9:1) or in DMEM containing 0.1% HSA and 0.5% ethanol. The N-modified PE in the media were then extracted using 2 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1); C17:0NAPE was added as internal standard, and the amount of N-modified PE was quantified by mass spectrometry. Solubility was calculated as the amount of N-modified PE measured in the extract of the DMEM, 0.1% HSA compared with that measured in the methanol/chloroform sample. The solubility of each PE in DMEM, 0.1% HSA was as follows: glt-PE, 118%; C18:0NAPE, 107%; OPA-PE, 85%; and γKA-PE, 109%. Therefore, all of the N-modified PEs appeared to be highly soluble in stimulation media. To assess the extent that each N-modified PE as incorporated by HUVEC, we incubated the mixture containing 1 μm of each N-modified PE dissolved in the DMEM, 0.1% HSA, 0.5% ethanol with triplicate wells of HUVEC for 4 h, removed the mixture, washed the cells twice, added C17:0NAPE as internal standard, extracted the cellular phospholipids with chloroform/methanol (2:1) solution, and then analyzed by mass spectrometry. Incorporation of each of the N-modified PEs was as follows: glt-PE, 28%; C18:0NAPE, 33%; OPA-PE, 7%; and γKA-PE, 10%. HUVEC (passage 6) were seeded and treated as described above, except that HUVEC were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 1 h prior to treatment with vehicle, γKA-PE, or LPS in DMEM with 0.1% HSA for 4 h. Cell-based ELISAs were then performed as described previously (24Kilgore K.S. Shen J.P. Miller B.F. Ward P.A. Warren J.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1434-1441PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween (pH 7.4) and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 0.5 h at room temperature. Excess paraformaldehyde was quenched by incubation with 1% glycine for 1 h. Primary antibodies against ICAM-1 (sc-18853, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), VCAM-1 (sc-8304, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or E-selectin (sc-14011, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each well and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed; HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) was added for 1 h, and the immunocomplexes were quantified by absorbance at 405 nm using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt as peroxidase substrate. Expression was expressed as fold vehicle-only control. Levels of IL-8, MCP-1, and GAPDH mRNAs were measured after conversion to cDNA by quantitative real time PCR using IQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad). The primer pairs for each gene are listed as follows: (a) human IL-8 (NM_000584, from Sigma): sense GAG TGC TAA AGA ACT TAG ATG TCA G, antisense GCT TTA CAA TAA TTT CTG TGT TGG C, and probe TGG TCC ACT CTC AAT CAC TCT CAG T; (b) human MCP-1 (NM-002982, CCL2, from Sigma): sense CTC TCG CCT CCA GCA TGA AAG, antisense AGG TGA CTG GGG CAT TGA TTG, and probe CTG CCG CCC TTC TGT GCC TGC TG; and (c) human GAPDH (NM_002046 GAPDH, from Sigma): sense CAA AAT CAA GTG GGG CGA TGC, antisense CAA ATG AGC CCC AGC CTT CTC, and probe AGT CCA CTG GCG TCT TCA CCA CCT T. Data from five separated experiments were averaged. Shifts in the bilayer to hexagonal phase transition temperature of DiPoPE (TH) upon addition of a membrane additive is a sensitive indicator of the effect of the additive on membrane curvature (25Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7092-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Lipid films were made by first dissolving DiPoPE with or without a modified PE in chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v), at the appropriate ratios. The solvents were driven off by a stream of nitrogen, and the samples were kept for 3 h under high vacuum to remove the last traces of solvent. Dry lipid films were suspended in 20 mm PIPES, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) by vortexing to form multilamellar vesicles. The concentration of lipid in the samples studied was maintained at 2.5 mg/ml. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were made using a Nano II differential scanning calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp., Lindon, UT). The cell volume was 340 μl. The scan rate was 1 °C/min with a delay of 5 min between sequential scans in a series to allow for thermal equilibration. The features of the design of this instrument have been described (26Privalov G. Kavina V. Freire E. Privalov P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The calorimetry curves were analyzed by using the fitting program, DA-2, provided by Microcal Inc. (Northampton, MA), and plotted with Origin, version 7.0. HUVECs were treated with 1 μm γKA-NBD-PE for 1 h at 4 °C to allow the modified PE to accumulate in the plasma membrane of the cell. After 1 h, the cells were transferred to a humid incubator at 37 °C for 15 min, then washed twice with PBS, and fixed for 15 min with 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% saponin for 5 min per wash. The cells were then incubated in a humid chamber in the presence of the mouse anti-calnexin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4 °C. After incubating, the cells were rinsed four times in blocking buffer and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse antibody labeled with Alexa 547 fluorophore (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. At that point, the antibodies were fixed in place using 2.5% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan imaging upright microscope (Zeiss, Germany) using MetaMorph as the imaging software (Molecular Devices Inc.) To determine whether γKA-NBD-PE remained intact or was hydrolyzed during the incubation with HUVEC prior to fluorescence imaging, we incubated γKA-NBD-PE with either cell-free buffer or with HUVEC for 1 h at 4 °C and then for 15 min at 37 °C. After this incubation period, the solution was removed from cells; lipids were extracted using acidic modified Bligh-Dyer to ensure extraction of NBD-fatty acid metabolites, and the products were analyzed by TLC using chloroform, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, 0.25% potassium chloride (10:4:10:10:3.6) as solvent. γKA-NBD-PE and γKA-NBD-PE treated with Streptomyces chromofuscus phospholipase D (to produce NBD-phosphatidic acid), and γKA-NBD-PE treated with 0.35 n sodium hydroxide (to produce NBD-fatty acid) were used as references. By this analysis, the majority of NBD label remained as intact γKA-NBD-PE. The identity of the major NBD component as γKA-NBD-PE was verified by mass spectrometry. HUVEC were cultured in 100-mm dishes and treated with 3 μm PE or 3 μm γKA-PE for the designated time. After treatment, cells were washed, scraped, centrifuged, and resuspended in lysis buffer (prepared from 20× lysis buffer stock (C7027, Invitrogen) with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium molybdate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate added), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysates were then centrifuged to remove debris and stored at −20 °C until immunoblot analysis. 20 μl of lysate for each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane, and the membrane was cut into three strips for immunoblotting of appropriate ER stress response proteins as follows: <30 kDa (for CHOP), 34–70 kDa (for phospho-p38), and >70 kDa (for BiP/grp78). Each strip was incubated with appropriate primary antibody for CHOP (L63F7, Cell Signaling Technology), BiP/grp78 (C50B12, Cell Signaling Technology), or phospho-p38 (9211S, Cell Signaling Technology) and then visualized using fluorescent anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody and scanned by the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). After phospho-p38 immunoblotting, the membrane was stripped using Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce, 21059) and re-immunoblotted using antibody for actin (sc-1616-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Data from five separated experiments was analyzed by blot volume (INT/mm2) with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Actin volume was used for normalization. In two replicate experiments, total p38 (9212, Cell Signaling Technology) at the 60-min time point was also measured by immunoblotting, and the ratio of phospho-p38 to total p38 was determined. Two commonly used ER stress response inhibitors, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), were used to test the effect of inhibiting ER stress response signaling. Confluent HUVEC were pretreated with either vehicle, 300 μm AEBSF, or 300 μm TUDCA for 1 h, and the pretreatment media were removed and replaced with stimulation buffer containing γKA-PE. For experiments to measure CHOP and BiP expression, 100-mm dishes were used, and lysate preparation and immunoblotting were performed as described above with HUVEC being stimulated with 3 μm γKA-PE for 1 h. For adhesion assays, 96-well plates were used, and HUVEC were stimulated with 2 or 5 μm γKA-PE for 4 h prior to performing the THP-1 adhesion assay as described above. All statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism 4.03 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). ROS have previously been associated with activation of endothelial cells and inflammation. We hypothesized that formation of γKA-PE (or its metabolites) would be an important mediator of ROS-induced inflammation (Fig. 2A). To confirm that ROS induced inflammation, we treated confluent monolayers of HUVEC with 0–1 mm H2O2 and then measured the adhesion of calcein-labeled THP-1 monocytes to the stimulated HUVEC by fluorescence. THP-1 adhesion was normalized as the percent of fluorescence induced by 10 μg/ml LPS after subtraction of base-line fluorescence in vehicle-only treated cells. H2O2 dose-dependently (EC50 0.13 mm) induced adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to HUVEC (Fig. 2B). We then tested if 15-E2-isoketal, one of the eight regioisomers of γKA that are generated by peroxidation of arachidonic acid and that are the immediate precursors to γKA-PE, could also induce similar effects. We found that γKA also dose-dependently (EC50 3.5 μm) increased THP-1 adhesion to HUVEC (Fig. 2C). We have previously shown that the major product formed when γKA is added to HUVEC is γKA-PE, although γKA protein adducts form as well (17Sullivan C.B. Matafonova E. Roberts 2nd, L.J. Amarnath V. Davies S.S. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 999-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether the formation of γKA-PE was sufficient to induce HUVEC activation, we synthesized γKA-PE using 15-E2-isoketal as a representative regioisomer, and we tested its effect on HUVEC. Direct addition of γKA-PE to HUVEC dose-dependently (EC50 2.5 μm) increased THP-1 binding to HUVEC (Fig. 2D). Some N-modified PEs (e.g. NAPE) require hydrolysis of the parent phospholipid to generate the bioactive compound (i.e. N-acylethanolamides). Although the metabolism of γKA-PE in HUVEC has not been studied, purified PLA2 can hydrolyze γKA-PE in vitro to its lyso-PE analog (γKA-LPE) (18Li W. Laird J.M. Lu L. Roychowdhury S. Nagy L.E. Zhou R. Crabb J.W. Salomon R.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1539-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and we have shown that phospholipase D isolated from S. chromofuscus can hydrolyze γKA-PE in vitro to its ethanolamine analog (γKA-Etn) (17Sullivan C.B.

https://openalex.org/W2138201077,"Yeast Hsp104 is an AAA+ chaperone that rescues proteins from the aggregated state. Six protomers associate to form the functional hexamer. Each protomer contains two AAA+ modules, NBD1 and NBD2. Hsp104 converts energy provided by ATP into mechanical force used to thread polypeptides through its axial channel, thereby disrupting protein aggregates. But how the action of its 12 AAA+ domains is co-ordinated to catalyze disaggregation remained unexplained.

This concerted switch involves both cis and trans protomer interactions and provides Hsp104 with the mechanistic scaffold to catalyze disaggregation. It prepares the chaperone for polypeptide binding and activates NBD2 to generate the power strokes required to resolve protein aggregates.

IntroductionAAA+ proteins (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) comprise a functionally diverse family of molecular machines that share a large degree of sequence homology and an evolutionary conserved mechanism (1Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). AAA+ proteins use chemical energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to catalyze force-induced structural rearrangements of client molecules. However, the details of this mechano-chemical coupling are not well understood. AAA+ proteins consist of one or two conserved ATP-binding modules (NBDs) 2The abbreviations used are: NBDnucleotide binding domainANS8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acidATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)FFLfirefly luciferaseRCMLareduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbuminf-RCMLafluorescently labeled, reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin. linked to function-specific auxiliary domains. Each AAA+ module harbors canonical Walker A and Walker B motifs that are critical for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, respectively. In many cases, AAA+ proteins assemble into ring-shaped oligomers (2Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar).Hsp104 from yeast and its bacterial homolog, ClpB, are AAA+ chaperones that provide thermotolerance to their hosts by disassembling protein aggregates after heat shock (3Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 4Sanchez Y. Lindquist S.L.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Reactivation of these proteins seems to be crucial because the removal of protein aggregates by degradation was found to be insufficient for restoring cell viability (6Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R. Maglica Z. Lee S. Zentgraf H. Weber-Ban E.U. Dougan D.A. Tsai F.T. Mogk A. Bukau B.

To disrupt noncovalent interactions between aggregated polypeptides, Hsp104 and ClpB are believed to employ a common mechanism that involves co-operation with the Hsp70 chaperone system (8Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 9Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar): ATP binding and hydrolysis induce a sequence of domain movements in Hsp104 which in turn exert a mechanical force on bound polypeptide substrates (10Beinker P.

As a result, individual polypeptide chains are extracted from aggregates and threaded through the central channel of the disaggregase (6Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R. Maglica Z. Lee S.

This proposed mode of action is reminiscent of models established for other AAA+ proteins, such as the unfoldase unit of the proteasome or the bacterial unfoldases ClpA and ClpX, which unfold target polypeptides and feed them into the proteolytic chamber of an associated protease (14Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 15Kenniston J.A. Baker T.A. Fernandez J.M. Sauer R.T.

Nucleotide-induced domain rearrangements have been observed for several AAA+ proteins (18Wendler P. Shorter J. Plisson C. Cashikar A.G. Lindquist S. Saibil H.R. Cell. 2007; 131: 1366-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Rouiller I. DeLaBarre B. May A.P. Weis W.I. Brunger A.T. Milligan R.A. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but to what extent these movements occur in a co-ordinated fashion and how AAA+ machines couple chemical energy to mechanical work are largely unknown. For ClpX it has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis occurs randomly, i.e. without co-ordination among the six subunits, and facilitates progressive polypeptide processing (20Martin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Nature. 2005; 437: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For other AAA+ proteins concerted ATP hydrolysis in all domains has been proposed (21Gai D. Zhao R. Li D. Finkielstein C.V. Chen X.S. Cell. 2004; 119: 47-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 22Beuron F. Dreveny I. Yuan X. Pye V.E. McKeown C. Briggs L.C. Cliff M.J.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The question of allosteric communication has also been addressed for AAA+ proteins involved in disaggregation, although with inconclusive results. Both Hsp104 and ClpB are class-1 AAA+ proteins that contain two AAA+ modules per subunit, NBD1 and NBD2. In the functional hexamer, these modules form two rings that are stacked on top of each other (18Wendler P. Shorter J. Plisson C. Cashikar A.G. Lindquist S. Saibil H.R.

Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In the case of ClpB from Thermus thermophilus incorporation of nonfunctional subunits into functional hexamers was found to impair ATPase activity and disaggregation (24Werbeck N.D. Schlee S. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For Escherichia coli ClpB it was reported that mixing nonfunctional subunits with wild-type subunits unleashed unexpected protein remodeling and threading activity (25Hoskins J.R. Doyle S.M. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 22233-22238Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was further shown for both Hsp104 and ClpB that ATP binding to NBD1 greatly stimulates ATP turnover by NBD2 (12Schaupp A. Marcinowski M. Grimminger V. Bösl B. Walter S. J. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest an allosteric signaling network within the hexamer, the mechanistic details and implications for the chaperone function of Hsp104/ClpB remained unclear.Here, we examined the roles of individual NBDs by mixing active Hsp104 subunits with inactive subunits. We identified three distinct communication pathways that propagate allosteric signals within the hexamer and establish the mechanistic link between ATP hydrolysis and polypeptide translocation. To our knowledge, this is the first mechanistic description of an interdomain network that encompasses all 12 ATPase domain of a class-1 AAA+ protein. Our model provides a mechanistic understanding of how AAA+ proteins sense and respond to changes in nucleotide state and how this allosteric circuitry enables Hsp104 to disrupt protein aggregates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESUnless stated otherwise, experiments were carried out in 50 mm HEPES/KOH, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5 (HKM buffer) at 30 °C. Pyruvate kinase, l-lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP, ADP, and ATPγS were from Roche Applied Science. Recombinant luciferase was from Promega. Luciferin, acetylcoenzyme A (CoA), NADH, dithiothreitol (DTT), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals were from EMD Chemicals. We used previously described protocols to produce wild-type Hsp104 and variants, reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin (RCMLa) and fluorescently labeled, reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin (f-RCMLa) (27Bösl B.

Sis1/Hsp40 was expressed in E. coli BL21 containing a plasmid encoding a His6-tagged version of Sis1 and purified via Ni2+-chelating chromatography.Formation of Hsp104 Hetero ComplexesA constant concentration of type A subunits (at least one NBD is wild type-like) was mixed with varying concentrations of type B subunits (none of the NBDs is wild type-like) to yield the indicated mixing ratios. Mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and then diluted 10-fold into assay buffer. Mixing ratios are given as concentration of type B subunits over concentration of type A subunits. Experimental readouts, such as ATPase rate, were calculated based on the concentration of active subunits.ATPase ActivityATPase activity was monitored using a coupled enzymatic colorimetric assay (29Grimminger V. Richter K. Imhof A. Buchner J. Walter S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7378-7383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Kinetics were recorded in Cary50 spectrophotometer (Varian). ATP turnover/Hsp104 monomer was calculated from the slope of the reaction using a NADH extinction coefficient of 6200 m−1 cm−1.ANS Fluorescence5 μm Hsp104 was preincubated with 100 μm ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid) in HKM buffer and then mixed with 500 μm nucleotides or buffer. For ATP measurements, residual ADP was converted to ATP using 10 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase prior to mixing with the protein. Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a QuantaMaster4 (Photon Technology International) at 20 °C. Excitation was at 370 nm using 0.8-nm slits. Emission spectra were collected from 380 nm to 650 nm using 2-nm slits. Spectra were buffer-corrected. Experiments were carried out as independent triplicates and averaged.Polypeptide BindingBinding of f-RCMLa was monitored by changes in fluorescence anisotropy as described (27Bösl B. Grimminger V. Walter S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38170-38176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). FITC fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, and polarized emission was detected at 515 nm in a QuantaMaster4 equipped with autopolarizers. The f-RCMLa fraction bound to Hsp104 was calculated from the observed change in anisotropy. Values were normalized with respect to the binding amplitude of Hsp104 [bb].Luciferase DisaggregationFirefly luciferase (FFL) disaggregation was carried out as described previously (12Schaupp A. Marcinowski M. Grimminger V. Bösl B. Walter S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 674-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Beinker P. Schlee S. Groemping Y. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47160-47166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In short, FFL was denatured in HKM containing 8 m urea for at least 30 min and subsequently diluted 125-fold into refolding buffer (HKM, 2 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 20 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 mm DTT, 0.24 mm CoA, 50 μg/ml BSA, 0.1 mm luciferin) containing Hsp104, Hsc70, and Sis1 (see also figure legends). The increase in FFL activity over time was monitored in 96-well plates using an Omega FluoroStar (BMG Labtech). The initial slope and the luminescence signal after 70 min were used as a measure of disaggregation activity.Additional Methods are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Target genes, primers, sequences, and templates are shown in supplemental Table 1.DISCUSSIONProtein unfolding and aggregation pose severe threats to living cells. Yeast Hsp104 and bacterial ClpB are class-1 AAA+ chaperones that rescue proteins from the aggregated state (11Bösl B. Grimminger V. Walter S. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34Haslberger T. Bukau B. Mogk A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 88: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Barends T.R. Werbeck N.D. Reinstein J. Curr. Opin Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To this end, Hsp104 converts energy provided by ATP hydrolysis into a mechanical force used to disrupt protein aggregates. Previous studies indicated that the ATPase of Hsp104 is subject to allosteric regulation (12Schaupp A. Marcinowski M. Grimminger V. Bösl B. Walter S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 674-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Schirmer E.C. Ware D.M. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Yet it was not clear (i) which of the AAA+ modules in Hsp104 can communicate with each other and to what effect, (ii) whether allosteric cross-talk occurs within and/or between subunits (cis or trans), and (iii) what significance this allosteric communication has for the chaperone cycle. Using Hsp104 hexamers consisting of subunits with differing ATP binding and hydrolysis properties, we were able to map a sophisticated communication network that senses nucleotide states of AAA+ modules and transmits this information across the Hsp104 hexamer (Fig. 7). Three allosteric relations can be distinguished: (i) ATP in NBD1 inhibits ATP hydrolysis in other NBD1 domains, (ii) ATP in NBD1 stimulates ATP turnover in NBD2, and (iii) ATP in NBD2 increases the affinity of NBD1 for ATP.The first allosteric pathway interconnects the N-terminal AAA+ modules, NBD1. ATP hydrolysis in NBD1 was inhibited by incorporation of inactive, ATP-bound [b] NBD1 protomers. Conversely, the incorporation of nucleotide-free [−] NBD1s into [+b] hexamers stimulated ATPase activity in NBD1, demonstrating that the intrinsic ATPase of a given NBD1 depends on the nucleotide state of neighboring NBD1s. We conclude that NBD1 adopts two conformations, a T state with lower ATPase activity and an R state with higher ATPase activity (Fig. 7A). The R↔ T transition is concerted, i.e. it occurs simultaneously in a number (not necessarily all six) of protomers. ATP binding to NBD1 stabilizes the T state and slows down ATP hydrolysis in other NBD1s. The larger the number of subunits with ATP-bound NBD1s, the more likely the switch to the T state occurs. Conversely, ATP hydrolysis in NBD1 facilitates a concerted transition to the R state and increases the rate at which the other NBD1s hydrolyze ATP. Similar observations have been made for the hetero-oligomeric protease Yta10/12 (38Augustin S. Gerdes F. Lee S. Tsai F.T. Langer T. Tatsuta T. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 574-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a class-2 AAA+ protein with only one NBD/protomer, suggesting a conserved mode of ATP hydrolysis in the NBD1 ring. We conclude that the intrinsic propensity of NBD1s to adopt the same conformational state is the mechanistic basis for interprotomer cross-talk and allows propagation of ATP-induced structural rearrangements across the hexamer.The second allosteric signal generated by ATP binding to NBD1 is the stimulation of ATP turnover in NBD2, which has been noted previously but remained mechanistically unexplained (12Schaupp A. Marcinowski M. Grimminger V. Bösl B. Walter S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 674-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast to NBD1, which becomes inhibited, NBD2 responds with a pronounced increase in activity by ∼2 orders of magnitude. We propose that NBD2, like NBD1, adopts two states, T and R, with low and very high ATPase activity, respectively (Fig. 7B). This T↔ R transition and hence the ATPase activity of NBD2 is inversely linked to the T↔ R transition in NBD1: When NBD1 adopts the T state, NBD2 is in the R state and vice versa. Because of this inverse correlation, ATP binding to NBD1 (which stabilizes the T state in this domain) induces the R state in NBD2 and stimulates its ATPase activity. Although the NBD1→NBD2 pathway is intraprotomeric according to our model, the activation of NBD2 has nevertheless a strong trans component because the behavior of NBD1 is governed by the interprotomeric NBD1↔NBD1 interaction. NBD2 has low activity when the NBD1 ring is nucleotide free ([−+] or [−+·−b]) and gains maximum activity when all six NBD1s are occupied with ATP, as in [b+], [++·bb], and [b+·bb]. NBD2 activity is intermediate when the NBD1 ring is only partially occupied, although it appears to be irrelevant whether ATP is bound to the NBD1 of the stimulated NBD2 (cis), as in [b+·−b], or to an adjacent NBD1 (trans), as in [−+·bb]. Neither NBD1 ring configuration was able to activate NBD2 to its full extent. We conclude that rather than responding to ATP binding to a specific NBD1, NBD2 activation is coupled to the concerted T↔ R switch in NBD1. This linkage between the T↔ R switch in NBD1 and the conformational transition in NBD2 warrants that the activity of NBD2 is regulated in a concerted manner and responds to changes in the ATP occupancy of neighboring NBD1s. It also explains why NBD2 is sensitive to trans effects although cryo-EM data suggest that the structural interactions between adjacent NBD2 modules are very weak (39Wendler P. Shorter J. Snead D. Plisson C. Clare D.K. Lindquist S. Saibil H.R. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).A third component of the allosteric network we have identified concerns the affinity of NBD1 toward ATP, which is modulated by the nucleotide state of NBD2. Our data show that ATP binding to NBD2 promotes ATP binding to NBD1, whereas ATP hydrolysis in NBD2 decreases the affinity of NBD1 toward ATP (Fig. 7C). In the context of our model, NBD2 facilitates concerted switching between T and R states of NBD1 by modulating its affinity for ATP.What could a model for the ATPase cycle of Hsp104 look like that integrates the individual allosteric interactions? We suggest the mechanism outlined in Fig. 7D. At low ATP concentration, ATP binding occurs preferentially to NBD2, due to the low intrinsic Km of this domain (36Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). ATP is quickly converted to ADP, but the exchange of ADP against ATP is slow and hence rate-determining for the cycle. As a result, NBD2 is occupied predominantly with ADP, which inhibits ATP binding to NBD1 (Fig. 7C). NBD2 remains in the T state, and steady-state hydrolysis is slow (Fig. 7D, left cycle). With increasing ATP concentrations, NBD1 becomes increasingly occupied with ATP despite the destabilizing influence of NBD2. This induces a concerted allosteric transition in NBD1 (Fig. 7B), which in turn activates NBD2 by stimulating the nucleotide exchange reaction. Thus, ATP binding to NBD1 switches Hsp104 from the [RT] to the [TR] state (Fig. 7D, right cycle). Although the [b+] mutant can stay in the [TR] state with its highly active NBD2, this is not possible for wild-type Hsp104 due to its catalytically active NBD1, which forces the chaperone to revert to the [RT] state. However, the reader should be aware that the model in Fig. 7D is a simplification. Although ATP binding and hydrolysis in NBD1 allow Hsp104 to switch between [RT] and [TR] states, this is not an on/off switch in a mechanical sense. ATP binding and hydrolysis in NBD1 increase the probability that a given hexamer switches between the two states. Whether Hsp104 uses the slow, left branch of the ATPase cycle in Fig. 7D slow or fast branch on right is determined by the occupancy of NBD1 with ATP, which in turn depends on the levels of ATP and ADP as well as on the nucleotide state of NBD2. Under normal growth conditions, the ATP concentration in the yeast cytosol is in the low millimolar range whereas the ADP level is ∼5–10 times lower (40Osorio H. Carvalho E. del Valle M. Günther Sillero M.A. Moradas-Ferreira P. Sillero A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1578-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The concentration of ADP is relevant because ADP is a competitive inhibitor (41Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and thus increases the apparent Km for ATP. In view of these numbers, it is likely that the nucleotide state of NBD2 has a strong impact on the ATP occupancy of NBD1 and hence on the chaperone properties of Hsp104 in vivo. In particular, it opens the possibility that Hsp104 activity is regulated by intracellular ATP levels allowing its inactivation (i.e. switching to the slow branch) under conditions that are detrimental for protein refolding.How does this model explain the polypeptide binding and threading properties of [bb], [++], and the respective hetero hexamers? Presumably, the NBD1 T state also represents the high affinity state for polypeptide binding. In [bb] homo hexamers, subunits readily adopt the T state in the presence of ATP, which leads to a tight binding of polypeptides. The switch to the low affinity R state is blocked (no ATP hydrolysis), and the bound polypeptide cannot be released. In [++], ATP hydrolysis in NBD1 antagonizes the population of the high affinity T state and prevents its interaction with polypeptides. Incorporation of [bb] subunits into a wild-type hexamer causes an overall increase in ATP turnover. The basis for this increase is complex. As pointed out above, protomers deficient in NBD1 hydrolysis stabilize the [TR] state. Thus, [bb·++] hetero hexamers display a decreased ATPase activity in NBD1 but an increased ATPase activity in NBD2. The latter effect must be dominating because the overall activity is increased. In essence, the incorporation of [bb] subunits shifts ATPase activity from NBD1 to NBD2. The reduced ATPase activity of NBD1 has a strong impact on polypeptide binding: It increases ATP occupancy of NBD1, which in turn activates the concerted transition to the T state in [bb·++] hetero hexamers. This is the molecular basis underlying the substrate binding and modeling activities that Wickner and co-workers observed for [bb·++] mixtures of E. coli ClpB (25Hoskins J.R. Doyle S.M. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 22233-22238Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our quantitative analysis suggests that in the case of Hsp104, at least two protomers must be in the NBD1·ATP state to establish polypeptide binding, whereas at least two protomers must remain wild type-like for effective polypeptide release and translocation. One explanation is that Hsp104 functions as a dimer of trimers, and polypeptide processing can only occur if each of the operating units contains both [++] and [bb] subunits. It so happens that [+b] hydrolyzes ATP with a Hill coefficient of ∼3, i.e. three ATP molecules in NBD1 are cleaved simultaneously (data not shown), suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is synchronized only among a subset of the six protomers. This would impose a structural asymmetry within the NBD1 ring, which has been proposed for a number of AAA+ proteins including Hsp104 (39Wendler P. Shorter J. Snead D. Plisson C. Clare D.K. Lindquist S. Saibil H.R. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 42Glynn S.E. Martin A. Nager A.R. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T.

Also, [b+] hydrolyzes ATP with a Hill coefficient of ∼3, in agreement with the linkage between the R↔ T transition in NBD1 and NBD2 activity. The reciprocal regulation of NDB1 and NBD2 implies that a similar asymmetry should also exist between the two AAA+ rings. Our model suggests that NBD2 is the main engine of Hsp104 and assigns NBD1 a more regulatory role in mediating the switch between [RT] and [TR] states. This is in agreement with previous findings that NBD2 mutations affect Hsp104 function more severely than corresponding mutations in NBD1 (36Hattendorf D.A. Lindquist S.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 45Lum R. Tkach J.M. Vierling E. Glover J.R. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 2004; 279: 29139-29146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hsp104 function in vivo requires both AAA+ modules to bind and hydrolyze ATP (46Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzel J.D. Lindquist S. Nature. 1991; 353: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the chemical energy from ATP appears to be used to different ends in both AAA+ modules. In NBD1, it drives a conformational cycle that turns ATP hydrolysis in NBD2 on and off and controls binding and release of polypeptide substrates. In NBD2, it generates the mechanical force necessary to disrupt non-native protein structures. Hence, NBD1 co-ordinates polypeptide binding and power-stroke generation during disaggregation. IntroductionAAA+ proteins (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) comprise a functionally diverse family of molecular machines that share a large degree of sequence homology and an evolutionary conserved mechanism (1Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). AAA+ proteins use chemical energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to catalyze force-induced structural rearrangements of client molecules. However, the details of this mechano-chemical coupling are not well understood. AAA+ proteins consist of one or two conserved ATP-binding modules (NBDs) 2The abbreviations used are: NBDnucleotide binding domainANS8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acidATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)FFLfirefly luciferaseRCMLareduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbuminf-RCMLafluorescently labeled, reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin. linked to function-specific auxiliary domains. Each AAA+ module harbors canonical Walker A and Walker B motifs that are critical for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, respectively. In many cases, AAA+ proteins assemble into ring-shaped oligomers (2Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar).Hsp104 from yeast and its bacterial homolog, ClpB, are AAA+ chaperones that provide thermotolerance to their hosts by disassembling protein aggregates after heat shock (3Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 4Sanchez Y. Lindquist S.L.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Reactivation of these proteins seems to be crucial because the removal of protein aggregates by degradation was found to be insufficient for restoring cell viability (6Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R. Maglica Z. Lee S. Zentgraf H. Weber-Ban E.U. Dougan D.A. Tsai F.T. Mogk A. Bukau B.

To disrupt noncovalent interactions between aggregated polypeptides, Hsp104 and ClpB are believed to employ a common mechanism that involves co-operation with the Hsp70 chaperone system (8Glover J.R.

As a result, individual polypeptide chains are extracted from aggregates and threaded through the central channel of the disaggregase (6Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R. Maglica Z. Lee S.

This proposed mode of action is reminiscent of models established for other AAA+ proteins, such as the unfoldase unit of the proteasome or the bacterial unfoldases ClpA and ClpX, which unfold target polypeptides and feed them into the proteolytic chamber of an associated protease (14Weber-Ban E.U.

Nucleotide-induced domain rearrangements have been observed for several AAA+ proteins (18Wendler P. Shorter J. Plisson C. Cashikar A.G. Lindquist S. Saibil H.R.

Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but to what extent these movements occur in a co-ordinated fashion and how AAA+ machines couple chemical energy to mechanical work are largely unknown. For ClpX it has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis occurs randomly, i.e. without co-ordination among the six subunits, and facilitates progressive polypeptide processing (20Martin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Nature. 2005; 437: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For other AAA+ proteins concerted ATP hydrolysis in all domains has been proposed (21Gai D. Zhao R. Li D.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The question of allosteric communication has also been addressed for AAA+ proteins involved in disaggregation, although with inconclusive results. Both Hsp104 and ClpB are class-1 AAA+ proteins that contain two AAA+ modules per subunit, NBD1 and NBD2. In the functional hexamer, these modules form two rings that are stacked on top of each other (18Wendler P. Shorter J. Plisson C. Cashikar A.G. Lindquist S. Saibil H.R.

In the case of ClpB from Thermus thermophilus incorporation of nonfunctional subunits into functional hexamers was found to impair ATPase activity and disaggregation (24Werbeck N.D. Schlee S.

For Escherichia coli ClpB it was reported that mixing nonfunctional subunits with wild-type subunits unleashed unexpected protein remodeling and threading activity (25Hoskins J.R. Doyle S.M.

It was further shown for both Hsp104 and ClpB that ATP binding to NBD1 greatly stimulates ATP turnover by NBD2 (12Schaupp A. Marcinowski M. Grimminger V. Bösl B. Walter S. J. Mol.

Although these studies suggest an allosteric signaling network within the hexamer, the mechanistic details and implications for the chaperone function of Hsp104/ClpB remained unclear.Here, we examined the roles of individual NBDs by mixing active Hsp104 subunits with inactive subunits. We identified three distinct communication pathways that propagate allosteric signals within the hexamer and establish the mechanistic link between ATP hydrolysis and polypeptide translocation. To our knowledge, this is the first mechanistic description of an interdomain network that encompasses all 12 ATPase domain of a class-1 AAA+ protein. Our model provides a mechanistic understanding of how AAA+ proteins sense and respond to changes in nucleotide state and how this allosteric circuitry enables Hsp104 to disrupt protein aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1985207083,"Mutations in TRPV4 have been linked to three distinct axonal neuropathies. However, the pathogenic mechanism underlying these disorders remains unclear. Both gain and loss of calcium channel activity of the mutant TRPV4 have been suggested. Here, we show that the three previously reported TRPV4 mutant channels have a physiological localization and display an increased calcium channel activity, leading to increased cytotoxicity in three different cell types. Patch clamp experiments showed that cells expressing mutant TRPV4 have much larger whole-cell currents than those expressing the wild-type TRPV4 channel. Single channel recordings showed that the mutant channels have higher open probability, due to a modification of gating, and no change in single-channel conductance. These data support the hypothesis that a ""gain of function"" mechanism, possibly leading to increased intracellular calcium influx, underlies the pathogenesis of the TRPV4-linked axonal neuropathies, and may have immediate implications for designing rational therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2087970720,"Despite decades of speculation, the proton pumping mechanism of complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is unknown and continues to be controversial. Recent descriptions of the architecture of the hydrophobic region of complex I have resolved one vital issue: this region appears to have multiple proton transporters that are mechanically interlinked. Thus, transduction of conformational changes to drive the transmembrane transporters linked by a “connecting rod” during the reduction of ubiquinone (Q) can account for two or three of the four protons pumped per NADH oxidized. The remaining proton(s) must be pumped by direct coupling at the Q-binding site. Here, we present a mixed model based on a crucial constraint: the strong dependence on the pH gradient across the membrane (ΔpH) of superoxide generation at the Q-binding site of complex I. This model combines direct and indirect coupling mechanisms to account for the pumping of the four protons. It explains the observed properties of the semiquinone in the Q-binding site, the rapid superoxide production from this site during reverse electron transport, its low superoxide production during forward electron transport except in the presence of inhibitory Q-analogs and high protonmotive force, and the strong dependence of both modes of superoxide production on ΔpH.

Despite the importance of complex I to energy transformation, the mechanism of proton translocation remains a notable unknown in bioenergetics and is currently under intense scrutiny. Complex I is L-shaped and comprises a hydrophilic peripheral arm and a hydrophobic membrane domain (Fig. 1). The structure of the hydrophilic arm from Thermus thermophilus shows that it contains the flavin mononucleotide, which accepts electrons from NADH. Electrons are channeled from the flavin along a chain of iron-sulfur centers to the terminal iron-sulfur center (designated N2) (7Hinchliffe P. Sazanov L.A. Science. 2005; 309: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). N2 subsequently reduces ubiquinone (or an analog), the hydrogen carrier in the lipid phase. The Q-binding region of complex I is located at the junction of the two domains (1Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Advances in knowledge of the structure of complex I have led to crucial insight into its function. Despite general agreement (9Brand M.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) that four protons are translocated per pair of electrons (3Brown G.C.

Friedrich (12Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) proposed a mixed model of proton translocation with a “black box” direct redox-driven proton translocation in combination with conformational changes that coupled additional indirect proton translocation in the hydrophobic domain. The recent structure of the hydrophobic domain of complex I (13Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) provides strong evidence that at least some of the protons are indeed pumped by an indirect mechanism. The hydrophobic domain from Escherichia coli and T. thermophilus contains a long amphipathic α-helix that spans much of the domain and lies parallel to the membrane surface. This helix is proposed to act as a “connecting rod,” linking three putative membrane-domain proton-translocating subunits (13Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). A similar linking element has also been reported for the eukaryotic complex I (14Hunte C. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Science. 2010; 329: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). If conformational changes in the N2-Q interacting region of the hydrophilic arm are linked to this connecting rod, then the redox chemistry in the N2-Q region can be coupled to proton pumping in the hydrophobic domain (13Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, having a maximum of three conformationally driven proton pumps creates a significant problem for models that rely solely on indirect mechanisms for proton translocation because there is no simple way to explain the 4H+/2e stoichiometry by indirect pumping alone. Because models that use only direct or indirect mechanisms do not readily fit the observed 4H+/2e stoichiometry for complex I, mixed models are becoming more attractive (12Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 15Ohnishi S.T. Salerno J.C. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1891-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These combine direct proton translocation via Q-redox reactions coupled to conformational changes that extend into the hydrophobic domain to move additional protons through the interconnected proton pumps. However, none of these models specifies the nature of the direct proton pump beyond a generic black-box mechanism. We propose such a mixed model here that, unlike previous mixed models, has specific constraints for the direct redox-driven pump. These constraints are primarily extensions of the characteristics of mitochondrial complex I superoxide production integrated with the redox chemistry of complex I. Along with its role in energy transformation, complex I (and upstream dehydrogenases) also produces superoxide (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol.

Single electrons can reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide at the active site flavin (site IF) during NADH oxidation. Superoxide production from site IF occurs at a maximum rate when the flavin is fully reduced (22Esterházy D. King M.S. Yakovlev G. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3964-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 23Kussmaul L. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, the rate of superoxide production by complex I is much higher under conditions that drive reverse electron transport (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol.

Brand M.D. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1711-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The higher rate, along with differential responses to inhibitors and substrates, strongly implicates a second site in superoxide production by complex I (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol.

It is thought that this second site (site IQ) is a semiquinone in the region where the iron-sulfur center N2 interacts with Q (N2-Q). It is important to note that N2 is a single electron carrier; therefore, a semiquinone must be formed in the conversion of Q to QH2, or vice versa, by complex I. Initially observed and reviewed by Liu (28Liu S.S. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the superoxide produced by mitochondria or well coupled submitochondrial particles during reverse electron transport is sensitive to dissipation of Δp (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 17Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, site IQ is especially sensitive to ΔpH; superoxide production is strongly inhibited by addition of nigericin (in a high K+ medium) or phosphate (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 17Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), both of which lead to dissipation of ΔpH and a compensatory increase in membrane potential (Δψ) with no change in overall Δp. The Δp-dependence of superoxide production at site IQ during reverse electron transport indicates that the superoxide producer is involved, at least indirectly, in the translocation of protons by complex I. However, the key feature widely overlooked is that site IQ superoxide production is much more sensitive to ΔpH than to Δψ or Δp (17Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The effect of ΔpH is not simply a result of the matrix acidification that occurs when ΔpH is dissipated, as it is not replicated by acidification of the whole incubation (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 17Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This important observation indicates that the superoxide-producing species must be closely linked to a largely electroneutral movement of protons across the membrane (and is less strongly linked to the electrogenic steps of the mechanism). We propose that this superoxide is generated when an unstable semiquinone is formed in the N2-Q interacting region of complex I. Superoxide production by the flavin of complex I in intact mitochondria during forward electron transport is relatively low, but this rate increases when complex I Q-site inhibitors (rotenone, myxothiazol, or piericidin) are added. The addition of NADH-generating substrates in concert with inhibition of Q reduction by complex I results in a highly reduced mitochondrial NADH pool, maximizing superoxide generation by the flavin of complex I (17Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 32Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, even under these conditions, generation of Δp by addition of ATP markedly increases superoxide production by activating site IQ (17Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Importantly, this additional superoxide production is also ΔpH-sensitive and quantitatively equivalent to the rate at the same Δp and ΔpH during reverse electron transport (17Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The equivalence of these rates suggests that the site IQ superoxide producer can become accessible when electrons enter at the flavin and move into the complex in the physiological forward direction. However, special conditions of 1) a highly reduced NADH pool, 2) a high Δp with sufficiently high ΔpH component, and 3) blockage of electron escape to the bulk Q pool are required to create significant amounts of superoxide from this site during forward electron flow. Because N2 reduces Q by two sequential single electron additions, the overall reaction for complex I must contain a semiquinone intermediate. We propose a model of complex I proton translocation in which there is a semiquinone intermediate that is also a superoxide producer, and the steady-state concentration of the semiquinone (and the rate of superoxide production) depends strongly on ΔpH and more weakly on Δψ and Δp. The unique aspect of our model is that we incorporate this ΔpH sensitivity with the redox reactions forming the semiquinone as part of the direct proton translocation mechanism. Our model also proposes where the energetics of the redox reactions could be favorable for coupling conformational changes in the N2-Q region to the indirect translocation of protons by pumps in the hydrophobic domain. The mechanism must result in the movement of four protons across the membrane per pair of electrons. At least one of these protons must move via redox reactions in the N2-Q site, with the remaining protons pumped by indirect mechanisms in the hydrophobic domain. The superoxide producer QH• or the anionic Q̇̄ must be formed as an intermediate, with its steady-state concentration strongly dependent on ΔpH and, more weakly, on Δψ and Δp. Complex I generally runs close to equilibrium, with the strongly exergonic oxidation of NADH by Q balanced by the strongly endergonic reaction of proton translocation against Δp. Reverse electron transport is readily observed when Δp is maintained by oxidation of other substrates or hydrolysis of ATP and the membrane pool of Q is kept reduced, resulting in demonstrable reduction of NAD+. Thus, the overall proton pumping reaction must be reversible while remaining consistent with the observed characteristics of complex I superoxide production. At least two semiquinone signals associated with complex I have been observed by EPR (33Magnitsky S. Toulokhonova L. Yano T. Sled V.D. Hägerhäll C. Grivennikova V.G. Burbaev D.S. Vinogradov A.D. Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), one of which, designated SQNf, is uncoupler-sensitive and can only be observed in very well coupled submitochondrial particles at high Δp (33Magnitsky S. Toulokhonova L. Yano T. Sled V.D. Hägerhäll C. Grivennikova V.G. Burbaev D.S. Vinogradov A.D. Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The Δp sensitivity of this semiquinone strongly suggests that it is intimately involved in the generation of Δp. However, it is not clear if these signals come from two separate Q molecules or whether a single semiquinone can exist in different states (1Brandt U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 69-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Rapid kinetic measurements on preparations of purified complex I with a 1:1 stoichiometrically bound Q molecule indicate that the terminal iron-sulfur center, N2, is very rapidly reduced with no appearance of an EPR signal consistent with a semiquinone (34Verkhovskaya M.L. Belevich N. Euro L. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Verkhovskaya et al. (34Verkhovskaya M.L. Belevich N. Euro L. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) conclude that the Em,7 for the Q/semiquinone couple in complex I is quite low, and estimate −300 mV as an upper limit. In contrast, the Em,7 of N2 is the highest among complex I iron-sulfur centers (reported values range from −50 to −200 mV (35Medvedev E.S. Couch V.A. Stuchebrukhov A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 36Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar)) and is much higher than NADH (-320 mV) or the flavin (-340 mV) (36Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, the first electron from NADH is held on N2, and whenever it reduces Q to the semiquinone, a second electron from NADH and N2 rapidly completes the reduction to QH2, keeping the steady-state concentration of semiquinone very low. Because the Em,7 for the Q/semiquinone couple approaches the Em,7 of the NAD+/NADH couple, whereas the Q-pool has an Em,7 of +100 mV (Fig. 2), it seems likely that it is not the reduction of Q to the semiquinone but the reduction of the semiquinone to QH2 that is associated with a large energy drop that could be coupled to proton translocation (34Verkhovskaya M.L. Belevich N. Euro L. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The instability of the semiquinone and the coupling to proton pumping of its reduction to QH2 are central to our model. The pKa of N2 depends on its reduction state: the pKa of the reduced form is >8.5, and the pKa of the oxidized form is <6 (10Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A redox-Bohr proton pumping mechanism has been suggested to play a role at the N2-Q interacting region (10Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but mutation studies on Yarrowia lipolytica indicate that the loss of this redox-Bohr effect has no impact on the stoichiometry or rate of proton pumping by the complex (37Zwicker K. Galkin A. Dröse S. Grgic L. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23013-23017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these traits mean that at physiological pH, wild-type N2 will be protonated when reduced and deprotonated when oxidized. We incorporated this characteristic into our model, but it is not an essential feature of the proton pumping mechanism (in the mutant, the precise sites of protonation and deprotonation will be altered with no net effect on proton pumping). The model is illustrated in Fig. 3. The sequential steps are numbered, starting from the complex with no Q or QH2 bound in the N2-Q interacting region (state A, bottom). Inside refers to the mitochondrial matrix or prokaryotic cytoplasm, and outside refers to the intermembrane or periplasmic space. The model assumes the simplest pathway for electron flow. Electrons enter at N2 and pass sequentially to Q to form QH2. Conformational coupling to the membrane domain occurs when the unstable semiquinone relaxes to the more stable quinol. N2 protonates when reduced and deprotonates when oxidized. We then added protonations and deprotonations of Q at appropriate points to generate the observed ΔpH dependence of superoxide formation from the semiquinone. States A–C and H are stable, and states D–G are less stable. The N2-Q pocket is initially empty, with proton access from the inside (state A), and binds oxidized Q to form state B. N2 accepts an electron from upstream FeS centers (originally from NADH) and is immediately protonated from the inside to form state C. Note that steps 1 and 2 may occur in either order. N2 passes its electron (and, optionally, its proton) to Q, producing QH• and the very unstable state D. The large difference in Em,7 between N2 and the bound Q/semiquinone couple (34Verkhovskaya M.L. Belevich N. Euro L. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggests that this reaction is not favored. Moreover, there is little drop in free energy from the NAD+/NADH couple to this state, making this reaction unlikely to be coupled to proton translocation. When state D is formed, a second electron from the other upstream Fe-S centers rapidly reduces N2, forming state E. This transition to state E alters the gating of proton channels from the inside to the outside. We assume the anionic form of the semiquinone, Q̇̄, because the Δp-dependent SQNF is thought to be anionic (33Magnitsky S. Toulokhonova L. Yano T. Sled V.D. Hägerhäll C. Grivennikova V.G.

Biomembr. 2002; 34: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (see below for an alternative two-proton pumping formulation where a second proton from inside forms QH·). If a proton is released to the inside at step 3, it is taken up again here from the inside. The distribution between steps 4 and 5 of net charge transfer across the membrane depends on the location of the proton from N2 in the membrane once the gating is to the outside. To explain the strong ΔpH sensitivity of superoxide formation by state E, we assume that that proton from N2 moves to the outer surface of the membrane so that most of the charge translocation occurs in step 4. The second internal electron reduction of Q̇̄ to state F is coupled to the release of a proton to the outside, completing the directly coupled proton transport step (in the alternative two-proton formulation below, two protons are released from N2H and QH· to the outside). Q2− forms QH− by taking up a proton from the inside to generate state G. The pKa for this protonation is likely very high (>11 in 80% ethanol (38Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar)). Steps 5 and 6 involve deprotonation to the outside and protonation from the inside but only partial net charge transfer across the membrane, so, crucially, the relative occupancies of states E and G are strongly affected by ΔpH but less so by Δψ. QH− relaxes to QH2 by taking up a second proton from the inside and completing the catalytic cycle at state H. The pKa for this protonation is similarly expected to be >11 (38Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We propose that the unstable QH− interacts with the local protein environment, so relaxation of G to H in step 7 initiates conformational changes that drive the proton pumps in the hydrophobic domain (shown on the right of Fig. 3). These conformational changes in the N2-Q region work, by mechanical analogy, as a piston driving the proximal proton pump. The long amphipathic α-helix reported by Efremov et al. (13Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) acts as a connecting rod, linking the other indirect proton pumps in the membrane domain to the proximal pump. We use a schematic demonstration of a mechanism similar to Ref. 13Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar in that three proton pumps, each with high similarity to known ion antiporters, are forced through a proton pumping cycle by the conformational changes that occur in the N2-Q region. This is the power stroke for the conformationally driven proton pumps in the hydrophobic domain, driven by the unstable G relaxing to the stable H. The reduced QH2 is released to the membrane lipid environment, leaving the N2-Q interacting region empty (state A) and ready for another cycle. At sufficiently high Δp, complex I can reverse and transfer electrons from QH2 to NAD+. Our model feasibly works in both directions and accounts for the known reversibility of the overall reaction. Also central to our proposed model, superoxide production is highest under these conditions of reverse electron transport. Under conditions of high Δp, the indirect proton pumps will provide the energetic drive to reverse reactions 8–5, producing state E. Once the NAD+ pool and the upstream flavin mononucleotide and FeS centers are fully reduced by several turnovers of reverse electron transport, step 4 will become irreversible because of the lack of an electron acceptor. State E will have its maximum occupancy, and superoxide production from site IQ by reaction 9 will also be maximal, as observed. In this condition, the relative population of states E, F, and G will be dependent on ΔpH. Dissipation of ΔpH by addition of nigericin or phosphate will shift the equilibrium from state E to states F and G, in which Q is fully reduced and does not generate superoxide. Superoxide production by reaction 9 will fall dramatically, as observed. In addition, the total combined population of states E, F, and G will depend on the reversal of proton pumping at step 7, driven by Δp, so superoxide production at state E will also depend on Δp, as observed. Our model predicts that the formation of the relatively unstable Q̇̄ will be a barrier to the rate of reverse electron transport to NAD+ from QH2. Collapsing ΔpH with nigericin inhibits the rate of reverse electron transport but not the maximal steady state NAD+ reduction when driven by succinate oxidation in isolated mitochondria (17Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thus, it is Δp that sets the final reduction state of the intramitochondrial NADH pool (and the ΔpH-insensitive superoxide production from site IF) during reverse electron transport, but the loss of ΔpH substantially inhibits the rate of this process by lowering the steady-state concentration of state E, the transition state intermediate. Mitochondrial superoxide production by complex I in the presence of NADH-generating substrates is increased by complex I Q-site inhibitors such as rotenone. These inhibitors maximize NADH/NAD+ while abolishing Δp (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 27Ohnishi S.T. Ohnishi T. Muranaka S. Fujita H. Kimura H. Uemura K. Yoshida K. Utsumi K. J. Bioenerg.

Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We assert that this increase is predominantly from the flavin of complex I (site IF), which becomes more reduced in concert with the intramitochondrial cofactor pool. However, under these same conditions of high NADH/NAD+ and the presence of complex I Q-site inhibitors, establishing Δp by addition of ATP markedly increases superoxide production. This increase is diminished by collapsing ΔpH with nigericin (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). How can our model explain these results, given that these inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from complex I to the membrane Q-pool? If these complex I Q-site inhibitors allow Q binding at step 1 but preferentially block the release of bound QH2 at reaction 8, then our model explains these observations. NADH will reduce complex I, and in the presence of Q-site inhibitors and the absence of Δp, the primary species formed will be H. This condition will result in negligible site IQ superoxide production. However, establishing Δp by hydrolysis of ATP will reverse the membrane domain proton pumps and drive electrons back to E, where they will stall because of reduction of the other Fe-S centers by NADH. This will result in significant site IQ superoxide production by reaction 9, which will be particularly dependent on ΔpH, as discussed above. In the absence of Q-site inhibitors, the QH2 will be lost to the Q pool, and the reaction will not reverse when Δp is generated. In this way, the model explains the strict requirements that are observed for superoxide production from site IQ during forward electron transport: a highly reduced NADH pool, a high Δp with a high enough ΔpH component, and blockage of electron escape to the bulk Q pool (16Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). A recent model of complex I proton pumping suggests that only two of the hydrophobic domain proton pumps are active (15Ohnishi S.T. Salerno J.C. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1891-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Ohnishi T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Ohnishi S.T. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 4131-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The argument that only two protons are pumped in the membrane domain is based on the finding that mutation of conserved acidic residues in the NuoN subunit (one of the indirect pumps in the model by Efremov et al. (13Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar)) of E. coli complex I does not affect proton pumping (40Amarneh B. Vik S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In phylogenetically “higher” metazoans, the subunit equivalent to NuoN, subunit ND2 by mammalian nomenclature, has been truncated, losing three of the 14 highly conserved α-helices. These helices could be important to the structure required for proton translocation (41Birrell J.A. Hirst J. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 4247-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, in these species, indirect proton pumping may also be reduced to 2H+ per indirect cycle, although this has not been directly demonstrated. Our model can accommodate this possibility with only minor alterations to pump two protons per pair of electrons in the N2-Q site instead of one. This can be done by adding an extra protonation from the inside at step 4 and an extra deprotonation to the outside at step 5 (with the proviso that the semiquinone intermediate in state E will now be QH• instead of the anionic Q̇̄). Similarly, if this modification is allowed and three hydrophobic domain pumps operate, the model can generate a proton pumping stoichiometry of 5H+/2e. In conclusion, we present a simple general model of the proton pumping mechanism of complex I that is consistent with current understanding of the structure, reversibility, and proton pumping stoichiometry of the complex. Crucially, it explains the otherwise puzzling characteristics of superoxide production by complex I, which provide strong constraints that allow us to produce a model with unprecedented empirical support. No other model has attempted to explain this important side reaction of the complex, but any alternative model, or modification of this model, should be able to do so if it is to be taken seriously."
https://openalex.org/W2033262691,"Genomic uracil is a DNA lesion but also an essential key intermediate in adaptive immunity. In B cells, activation-induced cytidine deaminase deaminates cytosine to uracil (U:G mispairs) in Ig genes to initiate antibody maturation. Uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs) such as uracil N-glycosylase (UNG), single strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1), and thymine-DNA glycosylase remove uracil from DNA. Gene-targeted mouse models are extensively used to investigate the role of these enzymes in DNA repair and Ig diversification. However, possible species differences in uracil processing in humans and mice are yet not established. To address this, we analyzed UDG activities and quantities in human and mouse cell lines and in splenic B cells from Ung(+/+) and Ung(-/-) backcrossed mice. Interestingly, human cells displayed ∼15-fold higher total uracil excision capacity due to higher levels of UNG. In contrast, SMUG1 activity was ∼8-fold higher in mouse cells, constituting ∼50% of the total U:G excision activity compared with less than 1% in human cells. In activated B cells, both UNG and SMUG1 activities were at levels comparable with those measured for mouse cell lines. Moreover, SMUG1 activity per cell was not down-regulated after activation. We therefore suggest that SMUG1 may work as a weak backup activity for UNG2 during class switch recombination in Ung(-/-) mice. Our results reveal significant species differences in genomic uracil processing. These findings should be taken into account when mouse models are used in studies of uracil DNA repair and adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2116630265,"There is emerging evidence that C1 domains, motifs originally identified in PKC isozymes and responsible for binding of phorbol esters and diacylglycerol, interact with the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum protein p23 (Tmp21). In this study, we investigated whether PKCδ, a kinase widely implicated in apoptosis and inhibition of cell cycle progression, associates with p23 and determined the potential functional implications of this interaction. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we found that the PKCδ C1b domain associates with p23 and identified two key residues (Asp(245) and Met(266)) implicated in this interaction. Interestingly, silencing p23 from LNCaP prostate cancer cells using RNAi markedly enhanced PKCδ-dependent apoptosis and activation of PKCδ downstream effectors ROCK and JNK by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Moreover, translocation of PKCδ to the plasma membrane by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was enhanced in p23-depleted LNCaP cells. Notably, a PKCδ mutant that failed to interact with p23 triggered a strong apoptotic response when expressed in LNCaP cells. In summary, our data compellingly support the concept that C1 domains have dual roles both in lipid and protein associations and provide strong evidence that p23 acts as an anchoring protein that retains PKCδ at the perinuclear region, thus limiting the availability of this kinase for activation in response to stimuli."

We show here that RIAM is expressed in metastatic human melanoma cells and that both RIAM and Rap1 are required for BLM melanoma cell invasion. RIAM silencing in melanoma cells led to inhibition of tumor growth and to delayed metastasis in a severe combined immunodeficiency xenograft model. Defective invasion of RIAM-silenced melanoma cells arose from impairment in persistent cell migration directionality, which was associated with deficient activation of a Vav2-RhoA-ROCK-myosin light chain pathway. Expression of constitutively active Vav2 and RhoA in cells depleted for RIAM partially rescued their invasion, indicating that Vav2 and RhoA mediate RIAM function. These results suggest that inhibition of cell invasion in RIAM-silenced melanoma cells is likely based on altered cell contractility and cell polarization. Furthermore, we show that RIAM depletion reduces β1 integrin-dependent melanoma cell adhesion, which correlates with decreased activation of both Erk1/2 MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, two central molecules controlling cell growth and cell survival. In addition to causing inhibition of cell proliferation, RIAM silencing led to higher susceptibility to cell apoptosis. Together, these data suggest that defective activation of these kinases in RIAM-silenced cells could account for inhibition of melanoma cell growth and that RIAM might contribute to the dissemination of melanoma cells.

Rap1 belongs to the Ras family of small GTPases, which are molecular switches that couple extracellular signals with a variety of cellular responses, such as cell proliferation and survival, cell adhesion, and cell polarity (1Bos J.L.

Rap1 activation is regulated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, which stimulate exchange of bound GDP by GTP, and by GTPase-activating proteins, which promote GTP hydrolysis (4Bos J.L. Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2007; 129: 865-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). The GTP-associated form of Rap1 is responsible for interaction with its effectors, which then transmit the signaling necessary to generate cell responses. Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) 3The abbreviations used are: RIAM, Rap1-GTP-interacting adaptor molecule; MRL, Mig-10/RIAM/Lamellipodin; CA, constitutively active; MLC, myosin light chain; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency. is an effector protein for Rap1 that belongs to the MRL (Mig-10/RIAM/Lamellipodin) family of adaptor proteins (5Lafuente E.M. van Puijenbroek A.A.

RIAM contains an N-terminal coiled-coil region, a central Ras association, and pleckstrin homology domains, a C-terminal region rich in prolines, as well as several FPPP motifs with the potential of interacting with ENA-VASP proteins. RIAM is broadly expressed, and it was first characterized as a molecule that promotes Rap1-dependent β1 and β2 integrin activation on T lymphocytes (5Lafuente E.M. van Puijenbroek A.A. Krause M.

Subsequent work demonstrated that Rap1-RIAM association favors talin targeting to the plasma membrane through direct talin interaction with an N-terminal segment of RIAM, a process that contributed to integrin activation (6Watanabe N.

Furthermore, RIAM co-localizes with talin in lamellipodia (6Watanabe N. Bodin L. Pandey M. Krause M. Coughlin S. Boussiotis V.A. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), representing a mechanism that could help to localize activated integrins at these cell membrane protrusions. In addition, recent data indicated that an MRL ortholog in Drosophila called pico is required for tissue growth (8Lyulcheva E. Taylor E. Michael M. Vehlow A. Tan S. Fletcher A. Krause M. Bennett D. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 680-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), therefore widening the functional potential of MRL proteins in the control of different cellular responses. RIAM also regulates T cell receptor-mediated signaling. RIAM is recruited to immunological synapses during T cell-antigen presenting cell interactions (9Ménasché G. Kliche S. Chen E.J. Stradal T.E. Schraven B. Koretzky G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4070-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Notably, the T cell kinases ZAP-70, Fyn, and Lck can associate to RIAM and promote its tyrosine phosphorylation (10Patsoukis N. Lafuente E.M. Meraner P. Kim J. Dombkowski D. Li L. Boussiotis V.A. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra79Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, RIAM silencing leads to impairment in Ras-dependent signaling and to defective translocation of phospholipase C-γ1 to the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in inhibition of T cell activation (10Patsoukis N. Lafuente E.M. Meraner P. Kim J. Dombkowski D. Li L. Boussiotis V.A. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra79Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rap1 was shown to be activated in human melanoma cell lines and metastatic melanoma tissue, and it was proposed that its activation might control melanoma cell adhesion and migration (11Gao L. Feng Y. Bowers R. Becker-Hapak M. Gardner J. Council L. Linette G. Zhao H. Cornelius L.A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7880-7888Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rap1 activation correlates with high metastatic potential in prostate cancer cell lines, which was associated with a decrease in the expression of Rap1GAP (12Bailey C.L. Kelly P. Casey P.J. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4962-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Examination of the cancer transcriptome profiles from the Oncomine database reveals that RIAM mRNA is found in a significant proportion of metastatic melanoma samples. Therefore, the potentially expressed RIAM protein might regulate tumor cell motility upon binding to activated Rap1. Here, we show that RIAM protein is expressed in human metastatic melanoma tissue and in melanoma cell lines, and we have used highly invasive human melanoma cell lines as models to study the role of RIAM in melanoma cell invasion. The results indicated that RIAM is required during melanoma cell invasion and that it controls melanoma cell growth and metastasis in an in vivo xenograft model.

Packaging was performed with HEK293T cells, and viral supernatants were used to infect target cells that were selected by cell sorting based on their GFP expression. BALB/c SCID mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions were employed for xenograft studies. The Cientificas Ethics Committee of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones (Madrid, Spain) approved the protocols used for experiments with mice. Mice were injected subcutaneously in the lateral thoracic wall or intravenously into the tail vein with 1 × 106 cells.

The lower compartments of chambers were filled with invasion medium with or without CXCL12, and invasive cells were counted under a microscope. We performed wound healing assays to study cell migration.

CXCL12 was added in the upper reservoir, and cell movement was tracked (2 min for each frame for 5 h) using a Live Cell Imaging microscope. Euclidean mean distance was assessed with ImageJ software. For protrusion dynamics, paxillin-dsRed2-transfected cells were seeded at 5000 cells/well on fibronectin-coated (10 μg/ml) glass-bottom 96-well plates. Cells were allowed to attach for 45 min, and subsequently, images were taken every 10 min using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a ×60 oil-immersion objective. Rat tail collagen I (3.6 mg/ml) (Millipore, Billerica, MA) was equilibrated with NaHCO3/NaOH buffer to meet neutral pH, and immediately mixed with 10× DMEM and cells to have a final mixture of 0.8 mg/ml collagen I, 2× DMEM, 2.5% FBS suspension (2 × 105 cells/ml). 20 μl drops of this mixture were allowed to polymerize at 37 °C, and resulting gels were covered with DMEM/serum and incubated for 24–72 h. Cells were stained with DAPI (0.3 μm) and imaged using a Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS-UV and Nikon A1R confocal microscope with ×63 water-immersion and ×60 oil-immersion objectives. The Ethical Committee at Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón approved the protocols and process involving human melanoma samples. For immunohistochemistry, melanoma metastases from lymph nodes were immediately frozen, and acetone-fixed 4-μm-thick sections were first incubated with 10% nonimmune goat serum. Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 23 °C with the appropriated antibodies or isotype-matched control antibodies. All antibodies were first tested for reactivity on lymphoid tissue and skin. The slides were mounted using an aqueous permanent mounting medium (DAKO). Confocal microscopy images were captured using a Leica SP2-AOBS confocal microscope. For immunoprecipitation, melanoma cells were lysed (17Ticchioni M. Charvet C. Noraz N. Lamy L. Steinberg M. Bernard A. Deckert M. Blood. 2002; 99: 3111-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and extracts incubated with antibodies followed by specific coupling to protein A- or G-Sepharose beads, as established previously (18Bartolomé R.A. Wright N. Molina-Ortiz I. Sánchez-Luque F.J. Teixidó J. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8221-8230Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were subjected to immunoblotting with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and detection with chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Rap1, RhoA, and H-Ras GTPase assays were performed on cells incubated in suspension with CXCL12 (13Bartolomé R.A. Gálvez B.G. Longo N. Baleux F. Van Muijen G.N. Sánchez-Mateos P. Arroyo A.G. Teixidó J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2534-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Upon cell lysis, aliquots from extracts were kept for total lysate controls, and the remaining volume was incubated with GST-Ral-GDS (for active Rap1), GST-C21 (for active RhoA), or GST-Raf-RBD (for active H-Ras) fusion proteins in the presence of glutathione-agarose beads. Eluted proteins were subjected to immunoblotting with Rap1, RhoA, or H-Ras antibodies. Cell proliferation was assessed with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cells (8 × 103/well) were seeded in 96-well plates, incubated for 16 h, and subsequently stained with 0.5 mg/ml thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (Sigma). Resulting formazan was resuspended with 200 μl of DMSO/well, and absorbance was read at 540 nm. Soft agar assays were performed as described previously (19Cifone M.A. Fidler I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For cytotoxicity assays, cells were treated with cisplatin or H2O2; nonadherent cells were removed, and monolayers of surviving cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde. Upon staining with crystal violet, cells were washed and resuspended in acetic acid (33%), and absorbance was determined at 570 nm. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons. In both analyses, the minimum acceptable level of significance was p < 0.05. Rap1 in the highly metastatic human BLM melanoma cell line was found to be basally activated, but its activation was further increased upon exposure to CXCL12 (Fig. 1A), a chemokine that promotes melanoma cell invasion following binding to its receptor CXCR4 (13Bartolomé R.A.

Rap1 silencing with two different siRNAs and with shRap1 led to defective invasion across the three-dimensional Matrigel layers in response to CXCL12 (Fig. 1, B and C). Conversely, cells transfected with constitutively active Rap1 exhibited an increase in invasion compared with Rap1 WT or mock counterparts (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that the chemokine-promoted melanoma cell invasion needs Rap1 function. Earlier work demonstrated that GTP-bound active Rap1 interacts with RIAM (5Lafuente E.M. van Puijenbroek A.A. Krause M. Carman C.V. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Constantine E. Springer T.A. Gertler F.B. Boussiotis V.A. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To study if RIAM was expressed in human melanoma cells, we performed immunohistochemistry on metastatic melanoma surgical specimens using anti-RIAM antibodies and antibodies to the specific melanoma marker HMB-45. The analyses revealed low to medium RIAM expression on melanoma cells from macroscopically infiltrated lymph nodes (7 of 8 cases) (Fig. 2A; and supplemental Fig. S1), as well as on stromal components of the tumor microenvironment. The pattern of cellular RIAM distribution and localization inside the tumors was heterogeneous. Thus, some melanoma cells displayed a predominant cytoplasmic localization of RIAM, whereas in other cells RIAM was also found on cell membrane regions. Furthermore, melanoma cells positive for RIAM expression were detected across the tumoral mass but also on the invasive borders of the tumors. In addition to its expression on metastatic melanoma tissue, RIAM was found to be expressed on the melanoma cell lines BLM, MeWo, SK-Mel-147, and SK-Mel-173, whereas its expression was undetectable in Mel57 cells (supplemental Fig. S2A). Pulldown assays using the GST-Ral-GDS fusion protein showed that RIAM binds to Rap1-GTP in chemokine-stimulated BLM melanoma cells (Fig. 2B). To investigate if RIAM is needed for melanoma cell invasion, BLM cells were infected with lentiviral vectors designed for stable RIAM silencing (5Lafuente E.M. van Puijenbroek A.A. Krause M. Carman C.V. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Constantine E. Springer T.A. Gertler F.B. Boussiotis V.A. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Two different transfectants, D11 and F7, displayed between 80 and 90% decrease in RIAM expression compared with mock transfectants (Fig. 2C, top panel; and supplemental Fig. S2B). Control experiments revealed no alterations in CXCR4 or β1 integrin expression levels in these transfectants (data not shown). Invasion in response to CXCL12 was blocked in D11 and F7 cells (Fig. 2C, bottom panel), as well as in an additional RIAM-depleted subline, F8-luc, engineered to express luciferase for future in vivo bioluminescence studies (supplemental Fig. S2C). Moreover, transient knockdown of RIAM by siRNA RIAM 2 and 3 led to strong inhibition of invasion toward CXCL12, whereas partial RIAM depletion by siRNA RIAM 1 resulted in a modest inhibition of invasiveness (Fig. 2D). To test if defective invasion shown by RIAM-silenced BLM cells could also be detected using stimuli other than CXCL12, we analyzed cell invasion toward serum. Results revealed that D11 stable transfectants as well as cells transfected with RIAM siRNA had a blockade of invasiveness in response to serum (supplemental Fig. S2D). Further support for the important role of RIAM in melanoma cell invasion came from experiments using BLM cells overexpressing His- or Myc-tagged RIAM, which exhibited a remarkable up-regulation of invasiveness compared with mock transfectants (Fig. 2E). Importantly, defective invasion of RIAM-depleted D11 cells was rescued by RIAM-His overexpression (Fig. 2F), indicating that deficient invasion was specifically due to RIAM knockdown. Transfection of RIAM-His in Rap1 siRNA transfectants reversed their defective invasion, whereas active Rap1 was unable to recover the impairment in invasion displayed by siRIAM transfectants (Fig. 2G). These results strongly suggest that RIAM acts downstream of Rap1 during chemokine-stimulated melanoma cell invasion. To analyze if RIAM silencing in another RIAM-positive, highly invasive melanoma cell line led to deficient invasion, we used MV3 cells, which displayed impaired invasiveness following RIAM depletion (supplemental Fig. S2E). The defect in the invasion of RIAM-silenced cells was not due to alterations in secretion or expression of MMP-2 or MT1-MMP, two metalloproteinases involved in CXCL12-promoted melanoma cell invasion (14Bartolomé R.A. Molina-Ortiz I. Samaniego R. Sánchez-Mateos P. Bustelo X.R. Teixidó J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), or of MMP-9 (supplemental Fig. S2F). Together, these data indicate that melanoma cell invasion requires activation of the Rap-1-RIAM signaling pathway. In addition to their deficient invasion across three-dimensional Matrigel layers, wound closure assays showed that RIAM-depleted BLM cells displayed a significant inhibition of migration in the presence of CXCL12 (Fig. 3A). To investigate the mechanisms behind their impaired migration, we first analyzed migration by time-lapse microscopy in chemotaxis chambers. Mock cells displayed Euclidean mean distance migratory values that were more than 2-fold higher than those from RIAM knockdown transfectants, indicating that RIAM depletion affected persistent migration directionality (Fig. 3B; see also supplemental Videos 1 and 2). A close examination at membrane protrusions during migration revealed that although mock cells exhibited dynamic ruffle and filopodia extensions, cells depleted for RIAM showed periodic waves of lamellae protrusions that lead to a rounded morphology (Fig. 3C; and supplemental Videos 3 and 4). The deficiency in persistent migration directionality of RIAM-silenced cells might reflect a defective cell polarization, which could arise from alterations in cell contractility (21Gomes E.R. Jani S. Gundersen G.G. Cell. 2005; 121: 451-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). As stress fiber formation and contractility require Rho GTPase-dependent activation of the MLC of myosin II (22Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 23Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), we examined whether activation of RhoA and MLC may be altered in RIAM-silenced cells. We first analyzed phosphorylation of Vav2, which is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor activator molecule for RhoA (24Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 25Turner M. Billadeau D.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Both Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation and Vav2 binding to RhoA following CXCL12 stimulation were defective in D11 transfectants compared with mock counterparts (Fig. 4A), which were associated with impairment of RhoA activation (Fig. 4B). Instead, the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP, a GTPase-activating protein for RhoA, was similar in mock and D11 cells (data not shown). RhoA activates its downstream effector ROCK, which in turn phosphorylates MLC (23Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). As a readout of ROCK activity, we determined the phosphorylation at Thr-696 of one of its downstream targets, the myosin phosphatase subunit (MYPT1). The results showed a deficient MYPT1 phosphorylation in response to CXCL12 in RIAM-knockdown cells (Fig. 4C). Once phosphorylated, myosin II assembles into myosin filaments and associates with actin filaments for generation of contractile stress fibers that are needed for cell migration (26Vicente-Manzanares M. Ma X. Adelstein R.S. Horwitz A.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 778-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). We found that the defect in RhoA-ROCK activation in D11 cells was associated with a decrease in MLC phosphorylation levels (Fig. 4D), suggesting that activation of a Vav2-RhoA-ROCK-MLC pathway is impaired in RIAM-silenced melanoma cells. To determine whether altered Vav2-RhoA activation in RIAM knockdown cells accounted for inhibition of melanoma cell invasion, we expressed constitutively active forms of Vav2 and RhoA (Vav2 CA and RhoA CA, respectively) in mock and D11 cells, and we tested transfectants in invasion assays. Overexpression of Vav2 CA in D11 cells resulted in rescue of RhoA activation as well as to a partial recovery of invasion (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, overexpression of RhoA CA in D11 cells also led to a partial rescue of invasion compared with the same cells transfected with RhoA WT (Fig. 4F). Similarly, F8-Luc cells transfected with RhoA CA displayed higher invasion than the same cells transfected with RhoA WT forms (supplemental Fig. S3). These results indicate that impaired invasiveness shown by RIAM-silenced BLM melanoma cells involves a defect in Vav2-RhoA-ROCK-MLC activation. Analyses of cell distribution of endogenous and transfected RIAM revealed that it was found at the edges of cell protrusions, usually showing a patchy distribution, as well as diffusely in t"
https://openalex.org/W1985669487,"Tropomyosin (Tm) is a two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil protein with a well established role in regulation of actin cytoskeleton and muscle contraction. It is believed that many Tm functions are enabled by its flexibility whose nature has not been completely understood. We hypothesized that the well conserved non-canonical residue Gly-126 causes local destabilization of Tm. To test this, we substituted Gly-126 in skeletal muscle α-Tm either with an Ala residue, which should stabilize the Tm α-helix, or with an Arg residue, which is expected to stabilize both α-helix and coiled-coil structure of Tm. We have shown that both mutations dramatically reduce the rate of Tm proteolysis by trypsin at Asp-133. Differential scanning calorimetry was used for detailed investigation of thermal unfolding of the Tm mutants, both free in solution and bound to F-actin. It was shown that a significant part of wild type Tm unfolds in a non-cooperative manner at low temperature, and both mutations confer cooperativity to this part of the Tm molecule. The size of the flexible middle part of Tm is estimated to be 60-70 amino acid residues, about a quarter of the Tm molecule. Thus, our results show that flexibility is unevenly distributed in the Tm molecule and achieves the highest extent in its middle part. We conclude that the highly conserved Gly-126, acting in concert with the previously identified non-canonical Asp-137, destabilizes the middle part of Tm, resulting in a more flexible region that is important for Tm function."
https://openalex.org/W2048359567,"Genetic studies involving zebrafish and mice have demonstrated that the protein Gon4l (Gon4-like) is essential for hematopoiesis. These studies also suggested that Gon4l regulates gene expression during hematopoietic development, yet the biochemical function of Gon4l has not been defined. Here, we describe the identification of factors that interact with Gon4l and may cooperate with this protein to regulate gene expression. As predicted by polypeptide sequence conservation, Gon4l interacted and co-localized with the DNA-binding protein YY1 (Yin Yang 1). Density gradient sedimentation analysis of protein lysates from mouse M12 B cells showed that Gon4l and YY1 co-sediment with the transcriptional co-repressor Sin3a and its functional partner histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1. Consistent with these results, immunoprecipitation studies showed that Gon4l associates with Sin3a, HDAC1, and YY1 as a part of complexes that form in M12 cells. Sequential immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that Gon4l, YY1, Sin3a, and HDAC1 could all associate as components of a single complex and that a conserved domain spanning the central portion of Gon4l was required for formation of this complex. When targeted to DNA, Gon4l repressed the activity of a nearby promoter, which correlated with the ability to interact with Sin3a and HDAC1. Our data suggest that Sin3a, HDAC1, and YY1 are co-factors for Gon4l and that Gon4l may function as a platform for the assembly of complexes that regulate gene expression."

Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), it is surprising that similar macromolecular associations have not been observed in the CBM literature. The multienzyme complex expressed by Clostridium thermocellum, referred to as the “cellulosome,” is one of the most powerful and intricate plant cell wall-degrading systems described to date (21Bayer E.A.

The enzyme complex is anchored onto the plant cell wall by the noncatalytic scaffoldin protein, which contains a family 3 CBM that binds to crystalline cellulose (23Tormo J. Lamed R. Chirino A.J.

The catalytic subunits of the cellulosome also contain CBMs, which target β-glucans, xylans, uronic acids, and chitin (7Czjzek M. Bolam D.N. Mosbah A. Allouch J. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Bornet O.

The extent to which the cellulosome can be directed toward the myriad of carbohydrate structures in plant cell wall, however, remains relatively unexplored, and indeed, numerous cellulosomal proteins contain modules of unknown function that could, potentially, comprise CBMs that display novel specificities. Furthermore, the quaternary structure of the cellulosome may provide a background for cooperativity between the CBMs within this protein complex, although such interactions have not been observed experimentally. Here, we report the structure and biochemistry of a module, defined as CtCBM62, of the C. thermocellum cellulosomal protein Cthe_2193 (GenBankTM protein accession ABN53395.1; defined hereafter as CtXyl5A) that exhibits no significant sequence similarity to CBMs in the CAZy database. CtCBM62 displays a β-sandwich fold that binds to terminal α- and β-d-galactopyranose or l-arabinopyranose residues of complex polysaccharides. Ligand specificity is conferred primarily through extensive interactions with the axial O4 of galactose and arabinose, a distinctive feature of these two sugars. CtCBM62 also displays calcium-mediated oligomerization resulting in avidity effects that confer selectivity for polysaccharides rather than monovalent oligosaccharides. DNA encoding the following regions of CtXyl5A, GH5-CBM6-CBM13-Fn3-CtCBM62 Docl (mature CtXyl5A; see Fig. 1) and CtCBM62, were amplified using primers, containing NheI and XhoI restriction sites, listed in supplemental Table S1. The amplified DNAs were cloned into NheI/XhoI-restricted pET21a, such that the encoded recombinant proteins contain a C-terminal His6 tag. To express the two C. thermocellum proteins, Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), harboring appropriate recombinant plasmids, was cultured to mid-exponential phase in Luria broth at 37 °C followed by the addition of isopropyl β-d-galactopyranoside at 1 mm, to induce recombinant gene expression, and incubated for a further 5 h at 37 °C. The recombinant proteins were purified to >90% electrophoretic purity by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography using TalonTM, a cobalt-based matrix, and eluted with 100 mm imidazole, as described previously (19Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Szabó L. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14077-14082Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When preparing the selenomethionine derivative of CtCBM62 for crystallography, the protein was expressed in E. coli B834 (DE3), a methionine auxotroph, cultured in media comprising 1 liter of SelenoMet Medium BaseTM, 50 ml of SelenoMet Nutrient MixTM, and 4 ml of selenomethionine solution (10 mg/ml). Recombinant gene expression was as described above, as was protein purification, except that all buffers were supplemented with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the PCR-based QuikChange method (Stratagene) deploying the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. Affinity gel electrophoresis was used to screen for the binding of CtCBM62 to polysaccharides, following the method of Ref. 28Freelove A.C. Bolam D.N. White P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43010-43017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar. The proteins were subjected to nondenaturing PAGE, in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2, deploying parallel gels containing no ligand and the target polysaccharide at 100 μg/ml, respectively. The gels were also loaded with BSA, which acts as a nonbinding negative control. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and proteins that bound to the polysaccharide displayed reduced electrophoretic migration in the presence of the complex carbohydrate. The binding of CtCBM62 to its ligands was quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), as described previously (25Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Titrations were carried out in 50 mm Na-HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm CaCl2 (or 5 mm EDTA) at 25 °C. The reaction cell contained protein at 145 μm, while the syringe contained either the oligosaccharide at 10 mm or polysaccharide at 3–5 mg/ml. The titrations were analyzed using Microcal Origin version 7.0 software to derive n, Ka, and ΔH values, although ΔS was calculated using the standard thermodynamic equation, RTlnKa = ΔG = ΔH − TΔS. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using an Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) with an An60 Ti four-hole rotor. Purified CtCBM62 (see above) was dialyzed into either CaCl2 buffer (50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2) or EDTA buffer (50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA) using a Microdialyzer System 100 (Pierce). In each experiment, 400 μl of 1 mg/ml CtCBM62 and 410 μl of reference buffer were loaded into 12-mm double-sector Epon centerpieces equipped with quartz windows and equilibrated for ∼1 h at 20 °C. Experiments were performed at a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm and a wavelength of 280 nm. Data were collected over 8.5-h periods using a radial step size of 0.003 cm. The partial specific volume (v¯) of 0.7211 was calculated from the amino acid sequence. The buffer viscosity of 0.00892 centipoise and density of 1.0042 g/ml for the CaCl2 buffer or 1.005 g/ml for the EDTA buffer were calculated using the program SEDNTERP. All data analysis for sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using the program SEDFIT, version 12.1b. Continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution c(s) analyses were restrained by Marquardt-Levenberg regularization at a confidence interval p = 0.68 with uniform prior knowledge (29Brown P.H. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 4651-4661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The base line, meniscus, frictional coefficient, systematic time invariant, and radial invariant noise were fitted. The final fit c(Pδ)(s) implemented prior knowledge of discrete species for determining the size distribution (30Brown P.H. Balbo A. Schuck P. Biomacromolecules. 2007; 8: 2011-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The r.m.s.d. values for all reported experiments were 0.008 or less. CtCBM62 was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at 20 °C with an equal volume (1 μl) of protein and reservoir solution. The native and selenomethionine (in the presence of 5 mm DTT) forms of apo-CtCBM62 were crystallized in 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 m trisodium citrate, pH 8.3 (PEG/IonTM 1 screen condition 46; Hampton Research) at 150 mg/ml. CtCBM62 in complex with 10 mm xyloglucan oligosaccharides was crystallized in the same condition described above at a protein concentration of 191 mg/ml. CtCBM62, in complex with 10 mm 16-α-GalMan3, was crystallized in 0.5 m ammonium sulfate in 0.1 m Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (condition 59 of the PACT screen) also with protein at 191 mg/ml. The CtCBM62 crystals grew over 4–5 days, after which 25 μl of mother liquor, including 30% (v/v) glycerol, was added as the cryoprotectant before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All the crystals of CtCBM62 were in space group F432 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = c = 192.2 Å, with one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structure of apo-CtCBM62 was solved by SIRAS, exploiting both the anomalous scattering from the seleniums and the isomorphous differences between the selenomethionine derivative and the native diffraction data. After processing the diffraction data in XDS (31Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. 2010; D66: 125-132Crossref Scopus (11358) Google Scholar) and SCALA (32Evans P. CCP4 Daresbury Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing, DL/SCI/R34.

The SHELXE solvent flattened map was of sufficient quality to build manually, in COOT (35Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The ligand-bound structures of CtCBM62 were determined by molecular replacement with AMORE (36Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

(6Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4141) Google Scholar). The analysis identified 72 genes encoding modular proteins with elements corresponding to CAZy families of catalytic modules and CBMs, which, based on the presence of type I dockerins, were components of the cellulosome. The functions of many of these proteins have been demonstrated biochemically or inferred from sequence similarity to enzymes with known activities. There remain, however, several cellulosomal subunits that contain modules with no sequence similarity with proteins of known function. The open reading frame identified as locus Cthe_2193 (defined hereafter as CtXyl5A) is one such protein. The protein is likely to be secreted because it contains an N-terminal 20-residue signal peptide. The mature polypeptide includes 928 amino acids and consists of six modules, which are displayed in Fig. 1. In addition to the type I dockerin, the protein contains two CBMs from families 6 and 13, a fibronectin domain, and a GH5 module, which is likely to be the catalytic component of the protein (see the accompanying paper, which describes the biochemical properties of the full-length enzyme (38Correia A.S. Mazumder K. Bras J.L. Firbank S.J. Zhu Y. Lewis R.J. York W.S. Fontes C.M. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (********)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (75) Google Scholar)). A particularly noteworthy feature of the open reading frame is the sequence extending from 740 to 878, defined hereafter as CtCBM62, which displays no significant sequence similarity to proteins in the CAZy database. To investigate the function of CtCBM62, a recombinant form of this protein module was expressed in soluble form in E. coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Biochemical analysis of CtCBM62 failed to reveal catalytic activity against an extensive range of plant structural polysaccharides, including cellulose and various hemicellulose and pectin polymers (data not shown). To explore whether CtCBM62 fulfills a noncatalytic carbohydrate binding function, the capacity of the protein to bind to a range of polysaccharides was assessed by affinity gel electrophoresis. The data, reported in Table 2, show that the protein module binds to xyloglucan, arabinogalactan, and galactomannan, but does not recognize the other polymers evaluated, including the arabinoxylans that are hydrolyzed by CtXyl5A (38Correia A.S.

The protein module therefore includes a functional CBM and represents the founding member of a new family designated CBM62. To investigate the specificity of CtCBM62 in more detail, the capacity of the protein to bind to galactomannan- and xyloglucan-derived oligosaccharides and monosaccharides was assessed by ITC. The data, reported in Table 3, with example titrations displayed in Fig. 2, show that CtCBM62 does not bind to mannooligosaaccharides or cellulooligosaccharides, the backbone structures of galactomannan and xyloglucan, respectively, or the repeating XXXG (X is a backbone glucose decorated α1,6 with Xyl and G represents unsubstituted glucose) motif of xyloglucan (39Gloster T.M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 19177-19189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The protein, however, does bind to 16-α-d-GalMan3, 3646-α-d-Gal2Man5, and a mixture of XLXG, XLLG, and XXLG, where L is X in which the xylose is decorated with a β1,2-linked d-galactose residue. The stoichiometry of binding was unity for galactose residues (in the oligosaccharides) indicating that CtCBM62 has a single ligand-binding site. The thermodynamic data show that the binding of CtCBM62 to all its ligands is enthalpically driven, whereas the change in entropy makes a negative contribution to overall affinity, as observed for the majority of CBMs studied to date (14Pell G.

These data indicate that CtCBM62 binds to galactomannan, arabinogalactan, and xyloglucan, which are all decorated with galactose residues, through recognition of the hexose sugar. This view was confirmed by the observation that the protein binds to galactose and arabinose, in which O4 is axial, but not to sugars such as xylose, mannose, and glucose, where O4 is equatorial. Indeed, the similar affinity of CtCBM62 for 16-α-d-GalMan3 and galactose, and the lack of significant binding to XXXG, suggests that the backbone components of mannan and xyloglucan do not make significant interactions with the protein. It should be noted, however, that the affinity of the protein for Gal and 16-α-GalMan3 is 2 orders of magnitude lower than for galactomannan, whereas the Ka values for the xyloglucan oligosaccharides are also significantly lower than for the corresponding polysaccharide (Table 3).

https://openalex.org/W2041651230,"Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) is marked by high levels of protein antigen-specific T cell responses in sensitized individuals. Recent evidence has revealed a distinct pathway for T cell immunity directed against glycolipid antigens, but DTH to this class of antigen has been undetermined and difficult to prove due to their insolubility in aqueous solutions. Here, glucose monomycolate (GMM), a highly hydrophobic glycolipid of the cell wall of mycobacteria, was dispersed in aqueous solutions in the form of octaarginine-modified liposomes and tested for its ability to elicit cutaneous DTH responses in bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-immunized guinea pigs. After an intradermal challenge with the GMM liposome, a significant skin induration was observed in BCG-immunized, but not mock-treated, animals. The skin reaction peaked at around 2 days with local infiltration by mononuclear cells, and therefore, the response shared basic features with the classical DTH to protein antigens. Lymph node T cells from BCG-immunized guinea pigs specifically increased IFN-γ transcription in response to the GMM liposome, and this response was completely blocked by antibodies to CD1 lipid antigen-presenting molecules. Finally, whereas the T cells increased transcription of both T helper (Th) 1-type (IFN-γ and TNF-α) and Th2-type (IL-5 and IL-10) cytokines in response to the purified protein derivative or tuberculin, their GMM-specific response was skewed to Th1-type cytokine production known to be critical for protection against tuberculosis. Thus, our study reveals a novel form of DTH with medical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2086446823,"We have previously shown that the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) is capable of mediating cross-desensitization of several chemokine receptors including CCR5, but the biochemical mechanism of this process has not been fully elucidated. We have carried out a series of functional and biochemical studies and found that the mechanism of MOR-induced cross-desensitization of CCR5 involves the activation of PKCζ. Inhibition of PKCζ by its pseudosubstrate inhibitor, or its siRNA, or dominant negative mutants suppresses the cross-desensitization of CCR5. Our results further indicate that the activation of PKCζ is mediated through a pathway involving phosphoinositol-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). In addition, activation of MOR elevates the phosphorylation level and kinase activity of PKCζ. The phosphorylation of PKCζ can be suppressed by a dominant negative mutant of PDK1. We observed that following MOR activation, the interaction between PKCζ and PDK1 is immediately increased based on the analysis of fluorescent resonance energy transfer in cells with the expression of PKCζ-YFP and PDK1-CFP. In addition, cells expressing PKCζ kinase motif mutants (Lys-281, Thr-410, Thr-560) fail to exhibit full MOR-induced desensitization of CCR5 activity. Taken together, we propose that upon DAMGO treatment, MOR activates PKCζ through a PDK1-dependent signaling pathway to induce CCR5 phosphorylation and desensitization. Because CCR5 is a highly proinflammatory receptor, and a critical coreceptor for HIV-1, these results may provide a novel approach for the development of specific therapeutic agents to treat patients with certain inflammatory diseases or AIDS.

Recent work from our laboratories, and others, suggest that heterologous desensitization is the primary mechanism for the inhibitory activity of opioids for chemokine receptor function. Studies reported by Grimm et al. (13Grimm M.C. Ben-Baruch A. Taub D.D. Howard O.M. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J.J. Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Further studies have shown that activation of MOR in HEK293 cells stably expressing both MOR and CCR1, failed to migrate in response to CCL3, a CCR1 ligand (15Zhang N. Hodge D. Rogers T.J.

More recently, using both primary cells as well as stably transfected cell lines, we have shown that MOR activation induces heterologous desensitization of CCR5 but not CXCR4 (16Szabo I.

Our laboratories have previously shown that the MOR-induced cross-desensitization of CCR5 does not result in target receptor endocytosis (10Chen C. Li J. Bot G. Szabo I. Rogers T.J. Liu-Chen L.Y.

Evidence from studies of cross-talk between a number of chemokine, opioid, and formyl peptide receptors suggest that multiple processes may contribute to heterologous desensitization. However, the biochemical mechanism of cross-desensitization in most cases involves target receptor phosphorylation (10Chen C. Li J. Bot G. Szabo I. Rogers T.J. Liu-Chen L.Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 483: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Grimm M.C. Ben-Baruch A. Taub D.D. Howard O.M. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J.J. Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, studies from several laboratories have shown that second messenger-dependent kinases are required for heterologous desensitization of a number of G protein-coupled receptors (reviewed in Ref. 19Steele A.D. Szabo I. Bednar F. Rogers T.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and in particular, the function of protein kinase C (PKC) is typically required for the cross-talk between Gi-coupled receptors.We are particularly interested in the cross-talk consequences following the activation of MOR, since this receptor is the major receptor, which is activated following heroin or morphine abuse. Moreover, we have given our primary attention to the capacity of this opioid receptor to cross-desensitize CCR5, because this receptor is a critical major HIV co-receptor, and a major participant in inflammatory responses. The biochemical basis for the cross-talk between MOR and CCR5 has not previously been examined, and in the present study, we report that PKCζ, an atypical PKC, plays an important role in the MOR-induced cross-desensitization of CCR5. We employed a specific PKCζ pseudosubstrate inhibitor, a PKCζ siRNA, or PKCζ dominant negative mutants to show that the inhibition of PKCζ reduces the DAMGO-induced desensitization of CCR5. We also demonstrate that the activation of MOR promotes the association between CCR5 and PKCζ, and induces both the kinase activity of PKCζ, as well as the phosphorylation of CCR5 in both transfected cell lines and primary macrophages. Finally, we find that the MOR-induced activation of PKCζ is dependent on the activation of PDK1. Moreover, the activation of PKCζ is associated with the formation of a complex between PKCζ and PDK1.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we systematically analyzed the role of PKCζ in the MOR-induced desensitization of CCR5. Our results demonstrate that activated MOR up-regulates the activity of PKCζ through PDK1. PDK1 interacts with and phosphorylates PKCζ, and the activated PKCζ then phosphorylates CCR5 through its interaction with CCR5 at the cell membrane (Fig. 9). In the present study immunoprecipitated CCR5 from lysates, or cell membrane preparations, of cells treated with DAMGO, were analyzed for PKCζ-specific kinase activities in the protein complexes by either a radioisotope method, or by a non-radioactive colorimetric assay. The results show that the activation of MOR induces an elevation in PKCζ kinase activity, which can be inhibited by a PKCζ specific pseudosubstrate inhibitor. Immunoprecipitation analysis indicates that the phosphorylated and activated form of PKCζ directly associates with CCR5. These results suggest that PKCζ participates in the the heterologous desensitization of CCR5 through a phosphorylation mechanism. To our best knowledge, this is the first report showing that PKCζ mediates cross-desensitization between GPCRs by this mechanism.In this study, we propose a mechanism of PKCζ-mediated CCR5 desensitization in which MOR is activated by DAMGO, and this is followed by induction of PDK1 activation. We found that overexpression of KD-PDK1, a kinase-dead mutant of PDK1, decreases MOR-induced CCR5 desensitization. Previous studies have demonstrated that PDK1 can directly phosphorylate PKCζ (28Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Finally, we also demonstrated a rapid association of PDK1-CFP and PKCζ-YFP following MOR activation, based on FRET analysis. Collectively, these results suggest a signaling pathway in which MOR induces PDK1 activation, leading to association between PDK1 and PKCζ, and this results in PKCζ activation.As a general mechanism, our evaluation of both M13 and CMC transfected cell lines, as well as primary monocyte-derived macrophages, shows that the association between CCR5 and PKCζ is increased after MOR activation. The activated PKCζ may translocate to the cell membrane following MOR activation. PKCζ has previously been shown to translocate to the cellular membrane upon activation of this kinase with either ceramide in astocytes (27Galve-Roperh I. Haro A. Díaz-Laviada I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or by activation of opioid receptors using met-enkephalin (a non-selective opioid agonist), in HEK293 cells (15Zhang N. Hodge D. Rogers T.J. Oppenheim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12729-12736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The PKC family includes twelve serine-threonine kinases, which are subdivided into three groups based on structural homology. Classical PKCs (α, β1, β2, and γ) can be regulated by both calcium and diacylglycerol (DAG), while novel (δ, ∈, θ, and η) and atypical PKCs (ζ and ι/λ) are calcium independent, and only the activity of novel but not atypical PKCs can be activated by DAG.Structurally, PKCζ consists of a Phox-Bim1 (PB1) domain in the N terminus, a pseudosubstrate (PS) region, a C1 domain, and a Ser/Thr kinase domain in the C terminus. The kinase domain includes an ATP binding region, an activation loop, a turn motif and a hydrophobic motif. In the ATP binding region, Lys-281 is essential for kinase activity. Amino acid substitutions of Lys-281 have been used as kinase-defective dominant-negative forms of PKCζ. Thr-410 in the activation loop is phosphorylated by PDK1, and T410A loses enzymatic activity, while the Glu mutant T410E, which may mimick phsophorlated Thr, retains kinase activity (25Chou M.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25308-25316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). PKCζ Thr-560 in the turn motif is the autophosphorylation site, and its phosphorylation is also crucial for kinase activation (24Hirai T. Chida K. J. Biochem. 2003; 133: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar).Previous reports have suggested that PKC family members are involved in the cross-desensitization of CCR5 following activation of the high affinity formyl peptide receptor (FPR) in monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (30Le Y. Wetzel M.A. Shen W. Gong W. Rogers T.J. Henderson E.E. Wang J.M. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 99: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In these studies, W peptide, a potent agonist of FPR, induced phosphorylation of CCR5 in a PKC-dependent (staurosporine-inhibitable) manner (31Nasser M.W. Marjoram R.J. Brown S.L. Richardson R.M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Work carried out using various partially selective chemical inhibitors of the PKCs have suggested that either PKCδ or PKCζ appear to be necessary for opioid receptor-induced cross-desensitization of CCR1 (15Zhang N. Hodge D. Rogers T.J. Oppenheim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12729-12736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CXCR1-induced cross-desensitization of CCR5 appears to be dependent on PKC∈ (31Nasser M.W. Marjoram R.J. Brown S.L. Richardson R.M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, DAMGO treatment stimulates PKC∈ translocation to the cell membrane and induces MOR homologous desensitization in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (32Mandyam C.D. Thakker D.R. Standifer K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The variable use of PKC isoforms may enable the GPCRs to selectively cross-talk with other GPCRs, depending on the precise PKC family member that is induced, and the ability of the potential target receptor to serve as a substrate for that PKC member.PKCζ can be involved in some of the signaling responses mediated via other GPCRs. For example, PKCζ is involved in the polymorphonuclear leukocyte integrin-dependent adhesion and chemotaxis in responses to formyl peptide and CXCL8 (33Laudanna C. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Constantin G. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30306-30315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Indeed, it would appear that PKCζ may participate in integrin activation pathways, based on studies showing that integrin-dependent signaling can result in PKCζ activation through the recruitment of small GTPases including Rho and cdc42 and subsequent recruitment and activation of this PKC (34Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). However, the results in the present report show that PKCζ-PSI fails to inhibit the calcium and chemotactic responses through CCR5. Taken together, these studies suggest that CCR5 may carry out signaling processes, which are less dependent on PKCζ than are the pathways initiated by the receptors for CXCL8 or formyl peptide.It should be acknowledged that signal transduction pathways other than the PDK1 and PKCζ pathway described here, may also play a role in MOR induced CCR5 desensitization. For example, other PKCs can also activate MAP kinases through phosphorylation of the serine/threonine protein kinase c-Raf (35Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and activated MAP kinases can in turn activate G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (36Rubino T. Viganò D. Premoli F. Castiglioni C. Bianchessi S. Zippel R. Parolaro D. Mol. Neurobiol. 2006; 33: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that GRKs may contribute to the desensitization of CCR5 by cross-phosphorylation (37Pollok-Kopp B. Schwarze K. Baradari V.K. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2190-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which would provide a pathway for PKC-mediated indirect phosphorylation of CCR5.It has been found that adaptors or scaffold proteins are required for PKCζ to achieve functional specificity and plasticity in various cellular processes. For example, PKCζ indirectly phosphorylates the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) by being recruited to the IL-4R complex through an interaction with the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase-1 (Jak1). Once recruited, Jak1 phosphorylates the IL-4Rα chain, creating a docking site for the SH2 domain of Stat6, which is then recruited and phosphorylated by the receptor-bound Jak1 (38Martin P. Villares R. Rodriguez-Mascarenhas S. Zaballos A. Leitges M. Kovac J. Sizing I. Rennert P. Márquez G. Martinez A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9866-9871Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).In controlling cell polarity, a ternary complex of PAR-2, PAR-6, and PKCζ or PKCλ is formed. Disruption of the protein complexes by overexpression of kinase-negative PKCζ and PAR-6 suppresses cell polarity (reviewed in Ref. 24Hirai T. Chida K. J. Biochem. 2003; 133: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, PKCζ associates with the nerve growth factor p75 receptor, and this association appears to require the participation of a scaffold protein, designated sequestosome-1 (p62) (39Noda Y. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Ota K. Yoshinaga S. Inagaki F. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43516-43524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The binding of PKCζ to p62 involves the interactions between PB1 domains within both PKCζ and p62. PB1 domains have also been identified in other scaffold proteins such as Partitioning Defective-6 (Par-6) and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-5 (40Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this way, p62 may potentially bind to a number of proteins involved in various biological processes. Recent evidence suggests that p62 plays a role in inflammation, neurogenesis, and T cell differentiation, by virtue of the heterodimerization of p62 with proteins such as PKCζ, PKCλ/τ, receptor-Interacting protein (RIP-1), and TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6) (41Mamidipudi V. Wooten M.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). p62 interacts with the atypical PKCs (PKCζ and PKCλ/ι) but not with any of the other closely related PKC family members. However, currently it is not clear whether the process of binding of phosphorylated PKCζ to CCR5 may require p62, or another scaffold protein(s) or kinases to mediate receptor phosphorylation.The activation of MOR is relevant to the situation that occurs with heroin abuse, and the consequences for CCR5 function in this setting is an important issue for further analysis. It should be pointed out that morphine, a natural heroin metabolite, exhibits agonist activity which is distinct in some respects from some other MOR-selective agonists such as DAMGO. For example, morphine fails to induce a significant degree of MOR internalization, in contrast to methadone, fentanyl, endomorphin 2, or DAMGO (42Macey T.A. Lowe J.D. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34515-34524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 43McPherson J. Rivero G. Baptist M. Liorente J. Al-Sabah S. Krasel C. Dewey W.L. Bailey C.P. Rosethorne E.M. Charlton S.J. Henderson G. Kelley E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 756-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). On the other hand, morphine is able to activate GIRK channels via MOR at a level, which is not significantly different than methadone or DAMGO (44Whistler J.L. Chuang H.H. Chu P. Jan L.Y. von Zastrow M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 737-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that these agonists exhibit differential signaling activities, or biased agonism (45Urban J.D. Clarke W.P. von Zastrow M. Nichols D.E. Koblika B. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Roth B.L. Christopoulos A. Sexton P.M. Miller K.J. Spedding M. Mailman R.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar).We believe our findings have implications for the possible development of PKCζ-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HIV-1 infections. We have previously shown that DAMGO-induced desensitization of CCR5 inhibits the capacity of human macrophages to be infected with R5 strains of HIV-1, in the absence of detectable internalization of CCR5 (16Szabo I. Wetzel M.A. Zhang N. Steele A.D. Kaminsky D.E. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y. Bednar F. Henderson E.E. Howard O.M. Oppenheim J.J. Rogers T.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2003; 74: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Based on the present results, it appears that the PKCζ-mediated phosphorylated form of CCR5 may be unable to function as a fully active co-receptor for this virus. Additional experiments to address the biochemical basis for the failure of macrophages to be infected with HIV-1 following MOR-induced cross-desensitization of CCR5 are currently underway in our laboratories. Moreover, given the clear role of CCR5 in inflammatory responses, and inflammatory disease conditions, we suggest that the present studies take on additional significance. The down-regulation of the functional activity of CCR5 following MOR activation, and the predominant role of PKCζ in mediating this process, suggest that a PKCζ-related therapeutic may be developed, which could be used to treat inflammatory disease states. IntroductionThere are three structurally related opioid receptors, designated μ, κ, and δ, and it is well established that activation of one or more of these receptors modulates the function of immune cells (1McCarthy L.

Recent work from our laboratories, and others, suggest that heterologous desensitization is the primary mechanism for the inhibitory activity of opioids for chemokine receptor function. Studies reported by Grimm et al. (13Grimm M.C. Ben-Baruch A. Taub D.D. Howard O.M. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J.J. Ann. N.Y. Acad.

The NMR studies reported here reveal a fairly extensive and well defined interface between the two MA-3 domains in solution, which appears to be stabilized by a network of interdomain salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, and reveals a unique orientation of the two domains. Characterization of the stoichiometry of the Pdcd4-eIF4A complex suggests that under physiological conditions Pdcd4 binds to a single molecule of eIF4A, which involves contacts with both Pdcd4 MA-3 domains. We also show that contacts mediated by a conserved acidic patch on the middle MA-3 domain of Pdcd4 are essential for forming a tight complex with eIF4A in vivo, whereas the equivalent region of the C-terminal MA-3 domain appears to have no role in complex formation in vivo. The formation of a 1:1 eIF4A-Pdcd4 complex in solution is consistent with the reported presence in vivo of only one molecule of eIF4A in the eIF4F complex. Pdcd4 has also been reported to interact directly with the middle region of eIF4G, however, we were unable to obtain any evidence for even a weak, transient direct interaction."

Soberman R.J. Spur B. Austen K.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both 5-lipoxygenase activating protein and LTC4S are integral membrane proteins of the nuclear membrane and belong to the membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism superfamily (22Jakobsson P.J.

Intracellular LTC4 is released by the multidrug resistance protein-mediated, energy-dependent pathway. It undergoes extracellular metabolism to LTD4 by the cleavage of glutamic acid via γ-glutamyl transpeptidase or γ-glutamyl leukotrienase and then to LTE4 by removal of glycine by dipeptidases (24Shi Z.Z.

Studies of mice with targeted disruption of LTC4S have extended the appreciation of the role of cys-LTs in models of inflammation beyond their smooth muscle activity. LTC4S−/− mice have a marked reduction in antigen-induced allergic pulmonary inflammation and in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (30Kim D.C. Hsu F.I. Barrett N.A. Friend D.S. Grenningloh R.

In addition, a functional receptor for LTE4-mediated vascular permeability was observed in mice lacking both the classical CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors (34Maekawa A. Kanaoka Y. Xing W. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16695-16700Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). An LTE4-reactive receptor has been considered likely because LTE4 has pathophysiological effects on airway inflammation in asthma, such as mucosal eosinophilia and airway hyperresponsiveness, although LTE4 has a much lower affinity for the established cys-LT receptors.The previous crystal structure study provided a detailed view of the GSH binding of LTC4S (35Ago H.

The GSH binding site is formed at the interface of two adjacent monomers in the LTC4S trimer. Nine amino acid residues interact directly with the bound GSH, and almost all of these amino acid residues are conserved in the amino acid sequence alignment in the membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism family. Tyr-93 and Arg-51, which had been proposed to be responsible for this catalysis based on the previous site-directed mutagenesis analysis (37Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Xu K. Baldasaro M.H. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13923-13928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), were included in the nine amino acid residues for GSH binding. Arg-104 is the only amino acid residue interacting with the thiol group and has been proposed to activate the thiol group of GSH (Fig. 1).The details on the catalytic activity of LTC4 biosynthesis by LTC4S remain to be determined. Based on the previous x-ray crystal structure of the LTC4S-GSH complex, how GSH is bound and activated was proposed. However, the amino acid residue(s) that is directly involved in the catalysis of LTA4 was elusive without LTA4 complex structure. We hypothesized that there is a certain amino acid residue forming a hydrogen bond with the epoxide oxygen of LTA4, because protonation of the epoxide group of LTA4 has a powerful impact on the reactivity of LTA4. The epoxide group of LTA4 is hydrolyzed readily in acidic solution, whereas it is less reactive in basic solution (38Rådmark O. Malmsten C. Samuelsson B. Goto G. Marfat A. Corey E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11828-11831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, to prepare LTA4 from LTA4 methyl ester (LTA4-Me), the hydrolysis of the methyl group of LTA4-Me proceeds without ring opening of the epoxide group in a basic solution, such as 0.25 m NaOH/acetone, as shown in the product insert from the supplier (Cayman Chemical) and the previous literature (39Carrier D.J. Bogri T. Cosentino G.P. Guse I. Rakhit S. Singh K. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1988; 34: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).We have proposed that the Arg-31 is the amino acid residue interacting with the epoxide oxygen based on the putative LTA4 binding model (Fig. 1) (35Ago H. Kanaoka Y. Irikura D. Lam B.K. Shimamura T. Austen K.F. Miyano M. Nature. 2007; 448: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). LTA4 binding models based on the binding of the hydrocarbon tail of dodecyl maltoside in the hydrophobic part of the active site have been proposed (35Ago H. Kanaoka Y. Irikura D. Lam B.K. Shimamura T. Austen K.F. Miyano M. Nature. 2007; 448: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 36Martinez Molina D. Wetterholm A. Kohl A. McCarthy A.A. Niegowski D. Ohlson E. Hammarberg T. Eshaghi S. Haeggström J.Z. Nordlund P. Nature. 2007; 448: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The proposed position of the epoxide group is a plausible position for the catalysis, although the proposed binding mode of LTA4 is still controversial due to a lack of the structural complex for LTC4S and LTA4. Nevertheless, the proposed LTA4 binding mode is consistent with the 5S-hydroxyl-6R-glutathionyl product stereochemistry by the SN2 nucleophilic substitution, where the C6 carbon as the electrophile faces the thiol group of GSH at the narrow path and the leaving epoxy oxygen at the other side of C6. In such a case, Arg-31, the side chain reaches the epoxide group in the putative LTA4 model, suggesting a catalytic role for Arg-31 in the reactivity of LTA4. Arg-31 was proposed to make the epoxide group reactive by forming a hydrogen bond with the epoxide oxygen in the carrying out of the catalytic mechanism. An enzymatic assay is needed to confirm the putative functions of these arginine residues suggested by the crystal structure.Based on the enzyme assay performed on the wild-type (WT) and mutant LTC4S, here we report that the two arginine residues Arg-31 and Arg-104 are the catalytic amino acid residues specific for LTA4 and GSH, respectively. The decreased kcat/Km of the mutant LTC4S missing Arg-31 or Arg-104 showed that the arginine residues closely participate in the catalysis. A comparison of the pH dependence of kcat and Km between WT LTC4S and these mutants showed that Arg-31 has the LTA4 activating, but not binding function of LTA4, and Arg-104 plays a role in both the activating and binding of GSH.DISCUSSIONBased on the previous x-ray crystallographic studies, we proposed that Arg-31 and Arg-104 constitute the catalytic architecture for conjugating LTA4 and GSH in the active site of LTC4S (Fig. 1) (35Ago H. Kanaoka Y. Irikura D. Lam B.K. Shimamura T. Austen K.F. Miyano M. Nature. 2007; 448: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To investigate further, we prepared mutant enzymes and performed the assays for enzymatic analysis to obtain first order kinetics as well as verification of the three-dimensional structures of the mutants.Role of Arg-31 and Arg-104 in the CatalysisThe kcat/Km of the WT LTC4S measured at pH 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0 were significantly higher than both of the R31A and R104A mutants (Fig. 3, A and B). The effects of each point mutation on the three-dimensional structures of the mutants were examined by the crystallographic and CD analyses. Using each corresponding isomorphous crystal, there were no indications of any significant structural changes in the difference Fourier maps between each mutant and the WT LTC4S other than the mutated residue, Arg-31 or Arg-104 (Fig. 5). In the CD analyses, the secondary structural elements of these mutants were similar to those of WT LTC4S. These results support the conclusion that the decreased kcat/Km of the mutants in comparison with WT LTC4S was caused by the lack of the side chain of Arg-31 or Arg-104, not by denaturing or partial unfolding imposed by the point mutation. It cannot be excluded that a certain minor structural perturbation may occur that is undetectable by the CD and the crystallographic analyses. As discussed below, Arg-31 and Arg-104 may play distinct roles in the enzymatic catalysis and cooperate to propagate conjugation between GSH and LTA4 at physiological pH levels.The binding function of Arg-104 for GSH was established because the R104A mutant exhibited a higher Km for GSH than the WT LTC4S and R31A mutants, in which the Km values are at the submillimolar level (Table 2). Furthermore, the pH dependence of the Km for the GSH of the WT LTC4S, R31A, and R104A mutants supports the binding function of Arg-104, as discussed below. The Km for the GSH of the WT LTC4S and R31A mutant was significantly decreased at pH 8.0 and higher pH (p < 0.001 against pH 7.0). The Km for the GSH of the R104A mutant increases at pH9.0 (p < 0.001), with a decrease at pH 8.0 (p < 0.05), in comparison with that at pH 7.0. The decreased Km for GSH at alkaline pH indicates that the enzymes with Arg-104 retained a higher affinity for GSH at the alkaline pH measured, in contrast to that of the enzyme without Arg-104, having a lower affinity for GSH at pH 9.0. The positively charged guanidino side chain of Arg-104 interacts with the thiol group of GSH directly in the crystal structure. The thiol group of GSH becomes a negatively charged thiolate anion at alkaline pH. Thus, attractive interaction between the positively charged side chain of Arg-104 and the negatively charged thiolate anion of GSH at alkaline pH contributes to the maintenance of the high affinity for GSH at alkaline pH.In addition to the binding function, the pH-dependent increase of the kcat of the R104A mutant to approximately the pKa of the thiol group shows the GSH activating function of Arg-104 at physiological pH (Fig. 3). The value of kcat is correlated to deprotonation of the thiol group, resulting in the formation of the thiolate anion as the active species in the catalysis. WT LTC4S has kcat values which are just as high at pH 7.0 as at a pH of 8.0 or higher. Therefore, the thiol group in the active site of WT LTC4S is considered to be deprotonated, even at pH 7.0. In contrast, the kcat of the R104A mutant increases in a pH-dependent manner. The kcat of the R104A mutant at pH 8.0 and pH 9.0 is ∼3-fold higher than at pH 7.0. Thus, the thiolate anion in the active site missing the Arg-104 increases at pH values higher than pH 7.0. The pH dependence profile of the deprotonation of GSH in the active site of the R104A mutant is concluded to be similar to that of free GSH with a normal pKa (49Chen W.J. Graminski G.F. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, the guanidino side chain interacting with the thiol group of GSH is responsible for the activation of the thiol group at pH 7.0 as well as the binding function of GSH, as discussed above.We have proposed that the guanidino side chain of Arg-31 forms a hydrogen bond with the epoxide oxygen, resulting in the formation of an electron deficient epoxide carbon as the target of nucleophilic attack by the thiolate anion of GSH at the initiation of catalysis (Fig. 1) (35Ago H. Kanaoka Y. Irikura D. Lam B.K. Shimamura T. Austen K.F. Miyano M. Nature. 2007; 448: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This is because the protonation of the epoxide group of LTA4 has a significant impact on the reactivity of the epoxide group (38Rådmark O. Malmsten C. Samuelsson B. Goto G. Marfat A. Corey E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11828-11831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Carrier D.J. Bogri T. Cosentino G.P. Guse I. Rakhit S. Singh K. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1988; 34: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the guanidino side chain of arginine has an extremely high pKa, the guanidino side chain can form a hydrogen bond with various polar functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups so forth (50Gu Y. Singh S.V. Ji X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12552-12557Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 51Hoff R.H. Hengge A.C. Wu L. Keng Y.F. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent computational studies have proposed that the guanidino side chain of arginine residue can act as a general acid (52Silva P.J. Ramos M.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005; 109: 18195-18200Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 53Silva P.J. Schulz C. Jahn D. Jahn M. Ramos M.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114: 8994-9001Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have also proposed that Arg-31 neutralizes a negative charge growing on the epoxide oxygen in the propagation of the nucleophilic attack on the electro-deficient carbon by the thiol group of GSH (Fig. 1) (35Ago H. Kanaoka Y. Irikura D. Lam B.K. Shimamura T. Austen K.F. Miyano M. Nature. 2007; 448: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).The enzymatic assay results for the R31A mutant were consistent with the previous proposal for the roles of Arg-31 in the catalysis (35Ago H. Kanaoka Y. Irikura D. Lam B.K. Shimamura T. Austen K.F. Miyano M. Nature. 2007; 448: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The remarkably decreased kcat and kcat/Km value of the R31A mutant in comparison to that of the WT LTC4S suggested that the side chain of Arg-31 interacts with a catalytically essential functional group of LTA4-Me (Fig. 3). The pH dependence of kcat of the R31A mutant, which was similar with that of the WT-LTC4S, showed that the side chain of Arg-31 may interact with the functional group of LTA4-Me, having a pKa outside of the measured pH range. The epoxide group of LTA4 is the essential functional group and also has a pKa outside of the measured pH range. This supports Arg-31 being the amino acid residue that interacts with the epoxide group of LTA4.Arg-31, but not bulk water, is supposed to form an effective hydrogen bond with the epoxide oxygen, accelerating the enzymatic catalysis. The R31A mutant with Ala-31, having a small apolar side chain, the R31L mutant with Leu-31, with a large apolar side chain, and the R31E mutant with Glu-31, having a negatively charged polar side chain, instead of Arg-31, with the longest and positively charged polar guanidino side chain, exhibited enzyme activity reduced to less than one tenth of the WT LTC4S (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the R31Q mutant, exhibiting 30% enzyme activity in comparison to WT LTC4S, shows that the neutral polar side chain of Gln-31 partly compensated for the role of the positively charged guanidino side chain of Arg-31 (Fig. 2A). Gln-31 cannot interact directly with an epoxide group such as Arg-31 due to the side chain being shorter than that of the arginine residue; thus, Gln-31 might affect the epoxide group through the hydrated water molecule(s) of the polar side chain of Gln-31. In addition, the drastically decreased enzymatic activity of the R31A and R31L mutants shows that the bulk water molecules are unable to compensate for the role of Arg-31 on the epoxy group. Furthermore, the R31E mutant with decreased enzyme activity shows that the negatively charged side chain of Glu-31 cannot compensate for the role of Arg-31 with the positively charged side chain, in contrast to Gln-31. The negatively charged side chain of Glu-31 makes the hydrated water molecules electrostatically negative. Therefore, the electrostatically negative water molecule hardly interacts with the negatively polarized epoxide oxygen or the negatively charged alkoxide group formed in the course of the catalysis. A polar functional group with fewer degrees of freedom of motion around the epoxide group of LTA4, such as the guanidino side chain of Arg-31 or the hydrated water molecule of Gln-31, makes an effective hydrogen bond with the epoxide group so as to accelerate the nucleophilic attack. Arg-31 probably fits as a catalytic amino acid residue for LTA4.In comparison with WT LTC4S, the R31A mutant sustained a comparable Km for LTA4-Me despite a much lower kcat (Table 2 and Fig. 3D). This suggests that Arg-31 does not contribute to the LTA4-Me binding, in contrast to the binding activity of Arg-104 for GSH.LTC4S has certain unique features as a nuclear membrane-embedded enzyme responsible for LTC4 biosynthesis. In our proposed catalytic mechanism, Arg-31 and Arg-104 function as the catalytic amino acid residues by forming a hydrogen bond with LTA4 and GSH, respectively. Arg-104 forming hydrogen bonds with the thiol group of GSH facilitates the formation of the thiolate anion as the nucleophile, and the thiolate anion attacks the epoxide carbon of LTA4. Furthermore, Arg-104 also substantially contributes to GSH binding. Arg-31, which increases the electrophilicity of the epoxide carbon of LTA4 through a hydrogen bond with the epoxide oxygen, makes the nucleophilic attack easy at the initial step. Concomitantly with the development of the nucleophilic attack, the protonated guanidino side chain of Arg-31 neutralizes the negative charge growing on the epoxide oxygen through the hydrogen bond. At the final step of the nucleophilic attack, Arg-31 may donate a proton at the generated alkoxide from the epoxide oxygen to transform the alkoxide group to the hydroxyl group of the product, LTC4, because alkoxide, the pKa of which is 16–18, is more basic than the guanidino side chain of the arginine residue (54Steiner E.C. Gilbert J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 3054-3055Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar).The results of the enzyme assay on the mutants of Arg-31 are consistent with the current LTA4 binding model but not sufficient to conclude that the model is correct. The model is speculated based on the crystal structure of the LTC4S complex with the hydrocarbon tail of dodecyl maltoside at the putative LTA4 binding site. Determination of the complexed structure of LTC4S with LTA4 is required to understand the LTA4 binding mode and functional role of Arg-31; however, the crystal structure analysis of LTC4S complexed with LTA4 is a great challenge because LTA4 is not stable.

During S-phase APC/C is inhibited by early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1) to allow the accumulation of cyclins A and B and to prevent re-replication. Emi1 is degraded at prophase by a Plk1-dependent pathway. Recent studies in which the degradation pathway of Emi1 was disrupted have shown that APC/C is activated at mitotic entry despite stabilization of Emi1. These results suggested the possibility of additional mechanisms other than degradation of Emi1, which release APC/C from inhibition by Emi1 upon entry into mitosis. In this study we report one such mechanism, by which the ability of Emi1 to inhibit APC/C is negatively regulated by CDKs. We show that in Plk1-inhibited cells Emi1 is stabilized and phosphorylated, that Emi1 is phosphorylated by CDKs in mitotic but not S-phase cell extracts, and that Emi1 phosphorylation by mitotic cell extracts or purified CDKs markedly reduces the ability of Emi1 to bind and to inhibit APC/C.

https://openalex.org/W2095288784,"The serine/threonine kinase RAF is a central component of the MAPK cascade. Regulation of RAF activity is highly complex and involves recruitment to membranes and association with Ras and scaffold proteins as well as multiple phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. Previously, we identified by molecular modeling an interaction between the N-region and the RKTR motif of the kinase domain in RAF and assigned a new function to this tetrapeptide segment. Here we found that a single substitution of each basic residue within the RKTR motif inhibited catalytic activity of all three RAF isoforms. However, the inhibition and phosphorylation pattern of C-RAF and A-RAF differed from B-RAF. Furthermore, substitution of the first arginine led to hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of A-RAF and C-RAF in plasma membrane fraction, indicating that this residue interferes with the recycling process of A-RAF and C-RAF but not B-RAF. In contrast, all RAF isoforms behave similarly with respect to the RKTR motif-dependent dimerization. The exchange of the second arginine led to exceedingly increased dimerization as long as one of the protomers was not mutated, suggesting that substitution of this residue with alanine may result in similar a structural rearrangement of the RAF kinase domain, as has been found for the C-RAF kinase domain co-crystallized with a dimerization-stabilizing RAF inhibitor. In summary, we provide evidence that each of the basic residues within the RKTR motif is indispensable for correct RAF function."

https://openalex.org/W2026209429,"The relative activity of the AKT kinase has been demonstrated to be a major determinant of sensitivity of tumor cells to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 inhibitors. Our previous studies have shown that the multifunctional RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 regulates a salvage pathway facilitating internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent mRNA translation of critical cellular determinants in an AKT-dependent manner following mTOR inhibitor exposure. This pathway functions by stimulating IRES-dependent translation in cells with relatively quiescent AKT, resulting in resistance to rapamycin. However, the pathway is repressed in cells with elevated AKT activity, rendering them sensitive to rapamycin-induced G1 arrest as a result of the inhibition of global eIF-4E-mediated translation. AKT phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 at serine 199 has been demonstrated to inhibit IRES-mediated translation initiation. Here we describe a phosphomimetic mutant of hnRNP A1 (S199E) that is capable of binding both the cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRES RNAs in vitro but lacks nucleic acid annealing activity, resulting in inhibition of IRES function in dicistronic mRNA reporter assays. Utilizing cells in which AKT is conditionally active, we demonstrate that overexpression of this mutant renders quiescent AKT-containing cells sensitive to rapamycin in vitro and in xenografts. We also demonstrate that activated AKT is strongly correlated with elevated Ser(P)199-hnRNP A1 levels in a panel of 22 glioblastomas.

To understand how this phosphorylation event may regulate the biochemical activities of hnRNP A1 and to further explore whether this particular phosphorylation event is critical and sufficient for AKT-dependent hypersensitivity to mTORC1 inhibition, we examined a substitution mutant of hnRNP A1.

In the present study, we describe a phosphomimetic mutant of the ITAF hnRNP A1 (S199E), which is able to bind to the cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRESs normally but is deficient in nucleic acid annealing activity. The mutant inhibits IRES activity in vitro, and overexpression of this mutant in cells inhibits cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRES activity in an AKT-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of the mutant also confers rapamycin hypersensitivity to quiescent AKT-containing cells both in culture and in xenograft experiments. Moreover, in primary glioblastoma samples, elevated levels of serine 473-phosphorylated AKT directly correlated with high levels of serine 199-phosphorylated hnRNP A1, supporting its applicability as a predictive biomarker for mTORC1 inhibitor therapies. The glioblastoma line LN229 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generously provided by Dr. Hong Wu (Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, UCLA).

Rapamycin and CCI-779 were obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA), and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen was from Sigma. Rapamycin was used at a concentration of 100 μm for 24 h for all treatments. The indicated dicistronic reporters were co-transfected into cells with pSVβ-galactosidase to normalize for transfection efficiency as described previously (5Jo O.D. Martin J. Bernath A. Masri J.

The cells were harvested 18 h after transfection, and Renilla, firefly, and β-galactosidase activities were determined (Dual-Glo luciferase and β-galactosidase assay systems; Promega). The indicated amounts of GST-hnRNP A1 and GST-S199E-hnRNP A1 were added to in vitro transcribed 32P-labeled RNAs corresponding to either the cyclin D1 or c-MYC IRESs in separate reactions in a volume of 10 ml in buffer containing 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 30 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 mm DTT, 4% glycerol, and 10 ng of yeast tRNA for 10 min at room temperature (5Jo O.D.

The membranes were washed and dried, and signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager. Binding curves of three independent experiments were fitted by using SigmaPlot to determine the apparent dissociation constants. ELISAs were performed as described (28King P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E20Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro transcribed biotinylated cyclin D1 or c-MYC IRES RNAs in binding buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 μm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 500 μm DTT, 4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.05 mg/ml poly(A) RNA, 0.125 mg/ml BSA, 0.4 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complexes, and 80 units/ml RNasin were mixed with various concentrations of recombinant hnRNP A1 S199E and immediately added to ELISA plates containing adsorbed native hnRNP A1. Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the plates were washed, and the amount of bound RNA was quantified via colorimetry by the addition of alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin and the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Absorbances were determined using a microplate reader using a 405-nm filter. Cell cycle distributions were determined by propidium iodide staining of cells, followed by flow cytometry as described previously (2Gera J.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Shi Y. Rettig M.B. Tran C. Hsu J.H.

The dicistronic plasmids were linearized using BamHI and capped RNA transcribed in vitro (mMESSAGE T7 transcription kit; Ambion). Capped RNA transcripts were used to program extracts of LN229 cells as described (5Jo O.D. Martin J. Bernath A. Masri J. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23274-23287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed as described previously by Kumar and Wilson (29Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 19-mer oligonucleotide 5′-ACGGCCAGTGCCAAGCTTG-3′ complementary to positions 6280–6298 on M13amp18(+) strand DNA was used as template in the annealing reactions. The oligonucleotide was 5′-end labeled and mixed with equimolar amounts (0.2 nm) of M13mp18 single-stranded DNA in the presence of native or S199E hnRNP A1 as indicated. Annealing reactions were allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 5 min and subsequently electrophoresed, and the gels were exposed to film. Flash-frozen normal brain and glioblastoma samples were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, National Cancer Institute (Western Division, Vanderbilt University Medical Center) under an institutional review board-approved protocol. Each glioblastoma sample was histopathologically reviewed, and those containing greater than 95% tumor were utilized in this analysis. Sections of paraffin-embedded tumors on slides were processed for immunohistochemistry and scored on a scale of 0–2 (0, no staining; 1, mild intensity staining; and 2, strong staining). Staining scores of 1 and 2 were considered positive. Correlation analysis used the Spearman nonparametric correlation test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. For additional multivariate analysis, we used a logistic regression model. The samples were also homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay (lysis) buffer using a Polytron homogenizer (Fisher) to generate protein extracts for Western blot analysis. Male SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with single cell suspensions of the LN229EV and LN229AKT-MER as described previously (30Masri J. Bernath A. Martin J. Jo O.D. Vartanian R. Funk A. Gera J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11712-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). AKT activity was induced by intraperitoneal maintenance injections of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT) in peanut oil. Tumor growth was measured, and mice were randomized to CCI-779 versus vehicle when tumors reached 200 mm3. Treatment (eight mice/experimental group) was given via intraperitoneal injection for five consecutive days. Tumor growth was assessed on day 8 or 12 after initiation of CCI-779 treatment. Tumor volume was determined using the formula L × W2 × 0.5, where L is the longest length, and W is the shortest length. IC50 was determined by extrapolation of plots of percent growth inhibition by CCI-779 versus log concentration. Statistical analysis was done with Student's t test and analysis of variance models using Systat 13 (Systat Software, Chicago, IL). To investigate AKT-dependent rapamycin sensitivity, our previous studies have utilized a panel of isogenic cell lines in which AKT activity had been modulated via stable expression of a myristoylated constitutively active allele of AKT or via ectopic expression of PTEN in PTEN-null lines. To determine whether we could conditionally regulate rapamycin sensitivity in an AKT-dependent manner, we engineered either LN229 glioblastoma cells (PTEN wt) or MEFs to express myr-AKT-MER, which is a fusion protein consisting of the active form of AKT fused to the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (MER). In both of these cell lines, myr-AKT-MER (subsequently referred to as AKT-MER) was expressed at levels comparable with endogenous AKT (Fig. 1A). The activity of the AKT-MER fusion protein has been demonstrated to be induced following exposure to the MER ligand 4OHT and inactive in its absence (31Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of the AKT-MER fusion conferred differential sensitivity to rapamycin in these cells, we exposed LN229AKT-MER, LN229EV, MEFAKT-MER, and MEFEV cells to 4OHT in the absence or presence of rapamycin and determined the relative cell cycle distributions by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1B, both the LN229 and MEF paired lines were relatively insensitive to rapamycin under these conditions; however, upon stimulation of AKT activity by 4OHT, both LN229AKT-MER and MEFAKT-MER cells were markedly sensitive to rapamycin and displayed significant reductions in S phase cell numbers as compared with controls. To determine whether conditional activation of AKT activity would also lead to differential cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRES activity as demonstrated in our previous studies (4Shi Y. Sharma A. Wu H. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10964-10973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we transiently transfected LN229AKT-MER, LN229EV, MEFAKT-MER, and MEFEV with the indicated dicistronic reporter constructs (Fig. 1C, top panel) containing either the cyclin D1 or c-MYC IRESs within the intercistronic regions of the constructs. The relative amount of firefly luciferase activity is indicative of IRES-mediated protein synthesis directed by either the cyclin D1 or c-MYC IRESs, whereas Renilla luciferase activity is a readout of cap-dependent initiation (4Shi Y. Sharma A. Wu H. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10964-10973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, in both the LN229 and MEF paired cell lines, expressing the myr-AKT-MER fusion stimulation of AKT activity strongly inhibited cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRES activity in LN229AKT-MER and MEFAKT-MER cells following rapamycin treatment, consistent with our previous studies showing that AKT activity negatively regulates cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRES function (4Shi Y. Sharma A. Wu H. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10964-10973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Renilla luciferase activity was not significantly affected by differential AKT activity but was reduced by ∼70–90% following rapamycin treatment compared with values obtained in its absence consistent with the effects of the drug on eIF-4E-mediated initiation (data not shown). Finally, we also examined the steady-state levels of various proteins (supplemental Fig. S1), including cyclin D1 and c-MYC, in these lines following AKT induction and exposure to rapamycin. As demonstrated previously, these lines exhibited the AKT-dependent alterations in cyclin D1 and c-MYC protein levels following rapamycin treatment and reflected the changes in IRES-mediated protein synthesis. These data demonstrate that the relative activity of the myr-AKT-MER fusion governs cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRES activities and rapamycin sensitivity in these lines. Initially we investigated whether the phosphomimetic mutant would support cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRES activity in vitro. Translation-competent cell extracts were prepared from cells in which hnRNP A1 had been knocked down via RNA interference (supplemental Fig. S2A) and programmed with in vitro transcribed dicistronic mRNAs containing either the cyclin D1 or c-MYC IRES within the intercistronic region. siRNA-mediated knockdown of hnRNP A1 resulted in undetectable levels as determined by immunoblotting, relative to a nontargeting scrambled sequence siRNA that had no appreciable effect on expression. The knockdown was also specific for hnRNP A1 because actin levels were unchanged in cells following treatment with the targeting siRNAs. The reduction in hnRNP A1 expression also did not significantly affect the ability of these extracts to support cap-dependent protein synthesis of exogenous Renilla mRNAs (supplemental Fig. S2B). These extracts were then supplemented with a negative control ITAF, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which binds the HAV IRES, native hnRNP A1, or hnRNP A1 S199E. The integrity and purity of the recombinant hnRNP A1 proteins were confirmed (supplemental Fig. S2C). As can be seen in Fig. 2, adding recombinant hnRNP A1 markedly stimulated both cyclin D1 (left panel) or c-MYC (right panel) in vitro IRES activity, whereas the addition of the hnRNP S199E mutant or the negative control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was unable to stimulate IRES activity. These data demonstrate that the addition of native hnRNP A1 is sufficient to support IRES activity and strongly suggest that the siRNA-mediated knockdown does not have apparent off target effects, while also confirming that the inhibition of IRES activity in these extracts is due to a direct effect of hnRNP A1. Additionally, these data demonstrate that the phosphomimetic mutant is unable to support cyclin D1 or c-MYC IRES activity in these cell extracts. To begin to address the mechanism by which the hnRNP A1 S199E mutant inhibited IRES activity, we initially sought to determine whether this mutant would bind the cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRESs normally. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), the hnRNP A1 mutant bound to both the cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRES RNAs, respectively, with equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) that were comparable with native hnRNP A1 (∼200 nm) as determined in filter binding assays. These values were consistent with our previous apparent Kd measurements (5Jo O.D. Martin J. Bernath A. Masri J. Lichtenstein A. Gera J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23274-23287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as well as those obtained for other hnRNP A1-IRES RNA interactions (23Bonnal S. Pileur F. Orsini C. Parker F. Pujol F. Prats A.C. Vagner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4144-4153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we also wanted to determine whether the hnRNP A1 S199E mutant could compete with native hnRNP A1 for cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRES binding. To investigate this, we utilized an ELISA-based RNA binding assay (28King P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E20Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this assay, hnRNP A1 was affixed to the ELISA well and subsequently allowed to bind biotinylated cyclin D1 or c-MYC IRES RNAs and hnRNP A1 S199E. Cyclin D1 or c-MYC IRES RNAs that bound the mutant are inaccessible for hnRNP A1 binding and are removed during washing procedures. The amount of retained RNA was quantified using streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and a colorimetric substrate. As shown in Fig. 3 (C and D), there was a concentration-dependent reduction of hnRNP A1 binding to the cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRESs, respectively, in the presence of the hnRNP A1 S199E mutant. An ITAF that binds specifically to the HAV IRES, GAPDH, was included as a negative control and did not display significant IRES RNA binding (32Schultz D.E. Hardin C.C. Lemon S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14134-14142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33Yi M. Schultz D.E. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6459-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These data taken together suggest that the phosphomimetic mutant of hnRNP A1 S199E is competent to bind both the cyclin D1 and c-MYC IRES RNAs and additionally can compete for binding with native hnRNP A1. To further investigate a possible mechanistic basis for the reduced IRES activities observed, we determined whether the S199E mutation affected the ability of hnRNP A1 to promote strand annealing. hnRNP A1 is known to facilitate strong RNA or DNA strand annealing comparably (19Idriss H.

https://openalex.org/W2126503833,"Type 2 diabetes is a global problem, and current ineffective therapeutic strategies pave the way for novel treatments like small molecular activators targeting glucokinase (GCK). GCK activity is fundamental to beta cell and hepatocyte glucose metabolism, and heterozygous activating and inactivating GCK mutations cause hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH) and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) respectively. Over 600 naturally occurring inactivating mutations have been reported, whereas only 13 activating mutations are documented to date. We report two novel GCK HH mutations (V389L and T103S) at residues where MODY mutations also occur (V389D and T103I). Using recombinant proteins with in vitro assays, we demonstrated that both HH mutants had a greater relative activity index than wild type (6.0 for V389L, 8.4 for T103S, and 1.0 for wild type). This was driven by an increased affinity for glucose (S(0.5), 3.3 ± 0.1 and 3.5 ± 0.1 mm, respectively) versus wild type (7.5 ± 0.1 mm). Correspondingly, the V389D and T103I MODY mutants had markedly reduced relative activity indexes (<0.1). T103I had an altered affinity for glucose (S(0.5), 24.9 ± 0.6 mm), whereas V389D also exhibited a reduced affinity for ATP and decreased catalysis rate (S(0.5), 78.6 ± 4.5 mm; ATP(K(m)), 1.5 ± 0.1 mm; K(cat), 10.3 ± 1.1s(-1)) compared with wild type (ATP(K(m)), 0.4 ± <0.1; K(cat), 62.9 ± 1.2). Both Thr-103 mutants showed reduced inhibition by the endogenous hepatic inhibitor glucokinase regulatory protein. Molecular modeling demonstrated that Thr-103 maps to the allosteric activator site, whereas Val-389 is located remotely to this position and all other previously reported activating mutations, highlighting α-helix 11 as a novel region regulating GCK activity. Our data suggest that pharmacological manipulation of GCK activity at locations distal from the allosteric activator site is possible."

https://openalex.org/W1977971321,"Sinorhizobium meliloti forms a symbiosis with the legume alfalfa, whereby it differentiates into a nitrogen-fixing bacteroid. The lipid A species of S. meliloti are modified with very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), which play a central role in bacteroid development. A six-gene cluster was hypothesized to be essential for the biosynthesis of VLCFA-modified lipid A. Previously, two cluster gene products, AcpXL and LpxXL, were found to be essential for S. meliloti lipid A VLCFA biosynthesis. In this paper, we show that the remaining four cluster genes are all involved in lipid A VLCFA biosynthesis. Therefore, we have identified novel gene products involved in the biosynthesis of these unusual lipid modifications. By physiological characterization of the cluster mutant strains, we demonstrate the importance of this gene cluster in the legume symbiosis and for growth in the absence of salt. Bacterial LPS species modified with VLCFAs are substantially less immunogenic than Escherichia coli LPS species, which lack VLCFAs. However, we show that the VLCFA modifications do not suppress the immunogenicity of S. meliloti LPS or affect the ability of S. meliloti to induce fluorescent plant defense molecules within the legume. Because VLCFA-modified lipids are produced by other rhizobia and mammalian pathogens, these findings will also be important in understanding the function and biosynthesis of these unusual fatty acids in diverse bacterial species."

Brinkmeier H. Müntener M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1215-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The sequence of EC coupling events begins with the depolarization of sarcolemmal and transverse tubular membranes that triggers a conformational change in the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR). Protein-protein interactions between the DHPR and the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) lead to the activation of the Ca2+ release channel function of RyR1, the release of Ca2+ from the SR via RyR1, and the generation of skeletal muscle contraction. Subsequently, relaxation is initiated by re-uptake of intracellular Ca2+ through the action of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase type 1 (SERCA1a). The correct functioning of the contraction/relaxation cycle relies on a precise balance between Ca2+ release and re-uptake. Disruptions in this balance, such as those that result from mutations in the proteins involved in the Ca2+ uptake and release processes, lead to muscle diseases, including Brody disease, malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, and cardiomyopathies (2Loke J.

RyR1 has numerous interacting protein partners; that is, both integral membrane proteins such as DHPR, junction, and triadin (6Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

These protein interactors are proposed to comprise an RyR1 Ca2+ release channel complex and to regulate RyR1 function at the molecular level. Previous studies elucidating RyR1 structure and topology showed that RyR1 can be subdivided into a soluble, N-terminal, cytosolic domain (amino acids 1–4243) and an insoluble, C-terminal, pore-forming sector (amino acids 4244–5038) containing at least 6 transmembrane sequences and a cytosolic tail (10Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this study we attached codons for a 6×-histidine affinity tag to the 3′ end of rabbit cDNA encoding amino acids 1–4243 of RyR1. The soluble, C-terminal-tagged cytosolic domain (cytosolic RyR1) was then expressed in HEK-293 cells for the purpose of isolating highly purified RyR1 and interacting protein partners under non-denaturing conditions. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was employed as a first screen in identifying these interacting proteins. Here, we identified calcium homeostasis endoplasmic reticulum protein (CHERP), as a protein that interacts with RyR1 and regulates its Ca2+ release channel function. The cDNA encoding the cytosolic N-terminal fragment of RyR1, described previously (10Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), was inserted into the Qiagen pQE expression vector system containing the dual tandem affinity tags encoding 6×-histidine and streptavidin-binding peptide to form the C-terminal His6 tag. The His6-tagged cytosolic RYR1 cDNA was then excised with XbaI and HindIII and treated to form a blunt end and ligated in-frame into the pcDNA3.1 vector via its EcoRV site. The His6-tagged RyR1 protein was expressed in HEK-293 cells by transfection with 10 μg of the cDNA construct per 100-mm plate using the standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol (11Chen S.R. Leong P. Imredy J.P. Bartlett C. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1904-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in an ice-cold solution of PBS (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm EDTA. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4100 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended and washed in ice-cold PBS alone. After removal of the supernatants, the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (5% sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mm PMSF, 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science), 0.01% Triton X-100, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cells were lysed using 25 strokes in a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer. To remove cell debris, the lysate was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was retained for analysis. Two μl of 50% Ni-NTA resin slurry per 1 plate of transfected HEK-293 cells was added to the protein extract, and the solution was rotated for 2 h at 4 °C to allow the tagged proteins to bind the Ni2+ via the His6 tag. Proteins bound to the Ni-NTA resin were then separated from the flow-through by centrifugation (4100 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) and washed 3 times in 1 ml of ice-cold Ni-NTA binding buffer (lysis buffer with 25 mm imidazole added) by rotation (5 min; 4 °C) followed by centrifugation (4100 rpm; 5 min; 4 °C). Bound proteins were eluted twice for 1 h with 100 μl of ice-cold elution buffer (binding/lysis buffer with 500 mm imidazole). Aliquots containing 100 μg of total protein from the elution fraction were prepared for trypsin digestion by the addition of ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, to 50 mm and CaCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mm in a total volume of 180 μl. Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 0.02 mg/ml proteomics grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (12Kislinger T. Cox B. Kannan A. Chung C. Hu P. Ignatchenko A.

Before application to the LC-MS columns, the digested peptides were solid-phase extracted using OMIX C-18 pipette tips (Varian Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Comprehensive gel-free shotgun sequencing of tryptic digests was performed essentially as described previously (13Gramolini A.O. Kislinger T. Alikhani-Koopaei R. Fong V. Thompson N.J. Isserlin R.

Briefly, for peptide separation, individual samples were first loaded onto microcapillary fused silica columns with an internal diameter of 75 μm packed with 7 cm of reversed phase C18 resin (Magic C18). The columns were aligned with an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer, and the peptides were eluted using a 2-h water/acetonitrile gradient and ionized via electrospray ionization. The tandem mass spectra generated were matched to peptide sequences in the human IPI protein sequence data base using the X!Tandem algorithm. Only proteins identified with at least two unique peptides were accepted for further experimental consideration. Immunoblotting was performed on protein fractions collected throughout the purification process. Thirty μg of protein from the cellular lysate, flow-through, final wash, and elution fractions from RyR1 Ni-NTA purifications were subjected to standard Western blotting techniques (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated first with the following commercial antibodies to target specific proteins: mouse monoclonal against RyR1 (Affinity Bioreagents), rabbit polyclonal against CHERP (Abcam), rabbit polyclonal against endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate complex 53 (ERGIC-53) (Sigma), goat polyclonal against T-complex protein (TCP) (Abcam), mouse monoclonal against DHPR (Affinity Bioreagents), and rabbit polyclonal against phosphorylase kinase α-subunit (PHK-α) and β-subunit (PHK-β) (Abcam). Blots were then incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG. Finally, the blots were incubated with the SuperSignal ultra chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) for 5 min and then exposed to a BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Skeletal muscle soleus fibers were isolated from the hind limbs of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats after euthanization via CO2 asphyxiation. Immediately after isolation, the tissue was incubated in excess ice-cold PBS for 30 min before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. Two 1-ml washes were then performed with freshly prepared permeabilization buffer (0.2% Tween 20, 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) at 4 °C for 15 min each. Immunofluorescence was performed on the skeletal muscle tissue as described by Sharma et al. (16Sharma P. Ignatchenko V. Grace K. Ursprung C. Kislinger T. Gramolini A.O. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e11496Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A microfluorimetry system was used to measure the effect of caffeine on Ca2+ release in HEK-293 cells. Cells were transfected at ∼50% confluence with full-length RyR1 cDNA via the calcium phosphate method (11Chen S.R. Leong P. Imredy J.P. Bartlett C. Zhang L. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1904-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The medium was changed after 24 h, and 2 h later siRNA was transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Ca2+ photometry was performed on intact cells 48 h after siRNA transfection. The cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen) for 1 h at pH 7.4 and room temperature in a physiological medium. The glass coverslips were placed in a holder on the stage of an inverted Olympus IX87 microscope. The samples were excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm with a dual monochromator. The emitted fluorescence was fed into a charge-coupled device camera. Acquired digital images were analyzed with the Quorum Analysis software. For the 340/380-nm ratio acquisitions, cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations were read over a period of 60 s with fluorescence measurements taken every 3 s, with 5–15 cells measured per run. At 30 s, the appropriate concentration of caffeine was added to induce Ca2+ release. No attempt was made to wash out caffeine during the procedure. Data are reported as the mean ± S.D. Statistical differences were evaluated by analysis of variance. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To test for expression of the cytosolic RyR1 construct, confocal microscopy imaging was performed on cytosolic-RyR1-transfected HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1A) using the 34C antibody against RyR1. Phase contrast imaging of the same cells (Fig. 1B) showed good transfection efficiency. WT HEK-293 control cells showed no signal (data not shown); thus, it can be deduced that the proteins visualized in Fig. 1 were generated from the cDNA construct and contain the His6 affinity tag. To ensure that an overexpressed protein of the size of cytosolic RyR1 could be purified efficiently, we examined eluants from Ni-NTA columns in Coomassie-stained gels (Fig. 1C). Purified cytosolic RyR1, indicated by a red arrow, was accompanied by multiple additional protein bands (black arrows), representative of co-purified potential RyR1 interacting proteins. To ensure that the protein detected by the red arrow in Fig. 1C was RyR1, immunoblot analysis was performed (Fig. 1D). The immunoblots show that a significant amount of the expressed recombinant protein was purified and concentrated in the elution fraction. A total of 9 Ni-NTA purifications were performed from HEK-293 cells, and the elution fractions were analyzed by MS. Of these, three were RyR1 purifications, three were negative control bead purifications, and three were His6-tagged DPYSL3 protein control purifications. This control was selected because DPYSL3 is a soluble cytosolic protein with few Gene Ontology terms associated with Ca2+ signaling and EC coupling (17Kowara R. Ménard M. Brown L. Chakravarthy B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 363: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Hamajima N. Matsuda K. Sakata S. Tamaki N. Sasaki M. Nonaka M. Gene. 1996; 180: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In every experimental run, only proteins that were supported by at least 2 unique peptides were accepted for further consideration. A total of 703 proteins were identified from all 9 purifications including controls and RyR tags. These proteins are represented in a heat map (Fig. 2, left) prioritized by ascending spectral count in the RyR1 MS runs. Of the 703 proteins detected, 323 were identified in at least 1 of the 3 RyR1 purifications, and the remaining 380 proteins were not considered further. To identify RyR1 interacting proteins with higher confidence, the subsets of identified proteins were filtered using two criteria. When proteins were found only in RyR purifications and not in controls, they were included only if they were present in at least two of the three RyR1 runs but not in any of the six control runs. For proteins that were found in both control and RyR purifications, spectral counts were averaged for each identified protein over the three RyR1 runs and for the six control runs to generate an enrichment value over controls. Only those proteins that were enriched by a factor of four were included. Forty-nine proteins passed these criteria, and they are represented in Fig. 2 (right) and listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Forty-nine filtered proteins from the RyR1 purificationsProtein nameSpectral count-RyR1 LC-MSRun 1Run 2Run 3RYR1, isoform 1 of ryanodine receptor 19811359VIM, vimentin811080LMAN1, protein ERGIC-53 precursor53520CAD protein424211RPS15, 40 S ribosomal protein S1540430SFRS10, isoform 1 of splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 1028320MYCBP2, MYC-binding protein 221100PRPF8, pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 820160ASCC3L1, isoform 1 of U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein helicase17143DHX30, isoform 1 of putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX3015100GYS1, GYS1 protein1440KRT14, keratin, type I cytoskeletal 1410190RPS9, 40 S ribosomal protein S9820CCT2, T-complex protein 1 subunit β81234SF3B1, splicing factor 3B subunit 18615CCT8, 59-kDa protein7444EFTUD2, 116-kDa U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein component792GEMIN4, component of gems 4670CCT5, T-complex protein 1 subunit ϵ6441LUC7L2, isoform 1 of putative RNA-binding protein Luc7-like 26120MRPS22, mitochondrial 28 S ribosomal protein S22520RPS4X, 40 S ribosomal protein S4, X isoform560CCT6A, T-complex protein 1 subunit ζ5620SF3B2, splicing factor 3B subunit 2540RPS24, isoform 1 of 40 S ribosomal protein S24430PTCD3, isoform 1 of pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein 3 (mito)430RPS16, 40 S ribosomal protein S16420MRPS31, 28 S ribosomal protein S31, mitochondrial precursor420GTPBP4, nucleolar GTP-binding protein 1366PRPF6, pre-mRNA-processing factor 6320EDC4, isoform 1 of enhancer of mRNA-decapping protein 4320SMN2, isoform SMN of survival motor neuron protein310MRPS10, mitochondrial 28 S ribosomal protein S10310TCP1, T-complex protein 1 subunit α3817RPS18;LOC100130553, 40 S ribosomal protein S18320RPS6, 40 S ribosomal protein S6240ATP5B, ATP synthase subunit β, mitochondrial precursor230RPL11, isoform 1 of 60 S ribosomal protein L11230MRPS25, mitochondrial 28 S ribosomal protein S25220WDR26, isoform 1 of WD repeat-containing protein 26220RSBN1, round spermatid basic protein 1220YTHDC1, isoform 1 of YTH domain-containing protein 1220MRPS9, mitochondrial ribosomal protein S9220HERC1, guanine nucleotide exchange factor p532201CHERP, calcium homeostasis endoplasmic reticulum protein2011RPS13, 40 S ribosomal protein S13120RPS26, OTTHUMP00000018641120PHKB, isoform 4 of phosphorylase b kinase regulatory subunit β120FKBP1A, FK506-binding protein 1A1014 Open table in a new tab To further filter this list, each protein was subjected to a literature search to assess its potential as an RyR1 interacting protein. Proteins classified as originating in the ribosome, the mitochondria, the spliceosome, or the histone fraction or as being associated with metabolism or heat shock were eliminated. This resulted in only five candidates passing these criteria. They were CHERP, TCP-α, PHK, ERGIC-53, and MYCBP2. MYCBP2 is an ubiquitin ligase (19Guo Q. Xie J. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9172-9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Jones M.H. Furlong R.A. Burkin H. Chalmers I.J. Brown G.M. Khwaja O. Affara N.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1695-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It was removed from consideration, as ubiquitin-related pathways are not likely to be involved in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. CHERP, TCP-α, PHKB, and ERGIC-53 were selected for subsequent interaction validation studies. CHERP, is an integral sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) membrane protein. It is a 916 (human)- and 936 (mouse)-amino acid protein. The human sequence is predicted to contain 1 luminal to cytosolic, transmembrane (TM) sequence near its N terminus (amino acids 233–252; predicted with “very high certainty” on the basis of a high hydrophobicity score of 1.25 using the Kyte-Doolittle scale (21O'Rourke F.A. LaPlante J.M. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). It also has a second potential TM sequence (amino acids 641–659; predicted with “putative” probability based on a 0.78 hydrophobicity score) (22Keshava Prasad T.S. Goel R. Kandasamy K. Keerthikumar S. Kumar S. Mathivanan S. Telikicherla D. Raju R. Shafreen B. Venugopal A. Balakrishnan L. Marimuthu A. Banerjee S. Somanathan D.S. Sebastian A. Rani S. Ray S. Harrys Kishore C.J. Kanth S. Ahmed M. Kashyap M.K. Mohmood R. Ramachandra Y.L. Krishna V. Rahiman B.A. Mohan S. Ranganathan P. Ramabadran S. Chaerkady R. Pandey A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D767-D772Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). This domain structure would suggest a luminal N terminus of 230 amino acids and either a long cytosolic domain of 664 amino acids (if 1 TM sequence) or 388 amino acids (if 2 TM sequences). A cytosolic coiled-coil domain at amino acids 290–312 is also predicted. Because CHERP has been described as playing a role in cytosolic Ca2+ cycling in various cell types (21O'Rourke F.A. LaPlante J.M. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Laplante J.M. O'Rourke F. Lu X. Fein A. Olsen A. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it was selected for further study. TCP-α is a molecular chaperone and a member of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (24Horwich A.L. Willison K.R. Philos. Trans R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1993; 339: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because it is unknown how a protein channel the size of RyR1 is organized and folded in vivo, TCP-α was deemed a potential candidate. Phosphorylase kinase is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase composed of several subunits, including calmodulin (the δ subunit) (25Brushia R.J. Walsh D.A. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D618-D641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of various RyR1 residues, in particular Ser-2843, activates RyR1 (26Reiken S. Lacampagne A. Zhou H. Kherani A. Lehnart S.E. Ward C. Huang F. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Rosemblit N. Warren M.S. He K.L. Yi G.H. Wang J. Burkhoff D. Vassort G. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, the rationale for including PHK as a potential RyR1 interacting protein was its potential for phosphorylating RyR1. ERGIC-53 is a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein receptor protein localized to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment that is involved in protein trafficking from the ER to the Golgi. Its affinity for substrates is dependent on cytosolic Ca2+ levels (27Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed on 25 μg of protein from the flow-through, first wash, final wash, and eluant fractions of the Ni-NTA purification step. Using antibodies against the four candidate proteins, we verified the presence of RyR1 interacting candidates in the purified samples together with RyR1 (Fig. 3A). ERGIC-53, CHERP, TCP, and PHK-α were all detected by immunoblotting after purification of affinity-tagged RyR1 on Ni-NTA resin. PHK-β staining was found to be unreliable and nonspecific and not pursued (results not shown). However, when the same experiments were performed in untransfected HEK-293 cells, faint bands for ERGIC-53, TCP, and PHK-α elutions indicated that those proteins were bound to the Ni-NTA resin in the absence of RyR1. Accordingly, they were eliminated as potential RyR1 interacting candidates. CHERP, however, was not found in any control blots. We were not able to perform successful co-immunoprecipitation assays from mouse or rabbit skeletal muscle either in a forward or reverse direction with any of the available RyR antibodies under numerous experimental conditions. These results are consistent with the extremely limited data concerning RyR immunoprecipitations in the literature. To ensure the effective suppression of CHERP levels, Western blotting was used to compare protein samples from HEK-293 cells expressing either RyR1 alone, RyR1 together with CHERP siRNA, or RyR1 together with a scrambled CHERP siRNA. Fig. 3B shows that RyR1 was expressed at comparable levels in all three treated cells and that endogenous CHERP was expressed at comparable levels in the cells expressing RyR1 or RyR1 plus scrambled siRNA. However, in those cells treated with CHERP siRNA, the expression of endogenous CHERP was reduced dramatically. To ensure that CHERP is expressed in WT skeletal muscle, we analyzed WT mouse skeletal muscle using Western blotting against protein samples from two different mice. Fig. 3C shows that CHERP is present in mouse skeletal muscle in the same samples that express RyR1 and skeletal myosin heavy chain. In skeletal muscle, RyR1 is retained in the junction terminal cisternae of the SR membrane (10Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Through immunofluorescence staining, RyR1 can be resolved as double rows of punctate immunosignals, with each spot representing a single triad structure. The Z-line lies between the RyR1 doublet (28Salanova M. Schiffl G. Rittweger J. Felsenberg D. Blottner D. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 130: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle co-stained with CHERP and RyR1 antibodies, co-localization and partial overlap pattern was evident (Fig. 4A). Co-localization and partial overlap was observed at both of the RyR1 double rows and was most consistent on the side facing the Z-line throughout the longitudinal section. This gave the appearance of two RyR1 rows, split by the Z-line, each with a CHERP row proximal to the Z-line. Fig. 4B shows the three-dimensional reconstitution of a Z-stack of two-dimensional images from mouse skeletal muscle tissue co-stained with RyR1 (green) and CHERP (red) antibodies. The Imaris analysis software allowed us to calculate the percentage of co-localization and overlap observed in a three-dimensional image. The co-localization software employed a computational algorithm to determine the presence of each signal in one voxel (a three-dimensional pixel), thus determining the percentage of co-localized voxels containing both green and red signals. Through this analysis, 22% of the voxels within the region of interest were found to colocalize. To ensure that colocalization results were not affected by the nonspecific binding of fluorescent secondary antibodies, we incubated rat soleus muscle with Alexa 488 and 633 secondary antibodies followed by confocal imaging. Under these conditions, co-staining could not be resolved, so we could not reconstruct three-dimensional images from a Z-series of images (data not shown). Our three-dimensional pattern of co-localization of RyR1 and CHERP (Fig. 4B) indicates that CHERP and RyR1 sit adjacen"

CD1d molecules are highly conserved antigen-presenting molecules expressed on several cell types, including antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, monocytes, and B lymphocytes. The presence of CD1d-lipid complexes on their cell surface allows the engagement of the iNKT TCR, leading to a rapid activation and secretion of Th1 (T helper type 1) and Th2 cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-4 (1Spada F.M.

Silk J.D. Masri S.H. Salio M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). One of the most potent iNKT cell agonists is α-galactosylceramide (αGalCer), which contains a galactose moiety connected through an α-glycosidic linkage to a ceramide lipid containing acyl and phytosphingosine chains. The lipid is embedded in the groove of CD1d molecules, as revealed by the CD1d crystal structure (6Koch M. Stronge V.S. Shepherd D. Gadola S.D. Mathew B. Ritter G. Fersht A.R. Besra G.S. Schmidt R.R.

Immunol. 2005; 6: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It has been shown that several synthesized analogs of αGalCer can activate iNKT cells. Among them is OCH12, which differs from αGalCer by a shorter phytosphingosine chain (C12 instead of C18) (8McCarthy C. Shepherd D. Fleire S. Stronge V.S. Koch M. Illarionov P.A. Bossi G. Salio M.

Med. 2007; 204: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the length of the phytosphingosine chain influences the affinity of the iNKT TCR for CD1d-lipid complexes (8McCarthy C. Shepherd D. Fleire S. Stronge V.S. Koch M. Illarionov P.A. Bossi G. Salio M. Denkberg G. Reddington F. Tarlton A. Reddy B.G. Schmidt R.R. Reiter Y. Griffiths G.M. van der Merwe P.A. Besra G.S. Jones E.Y. Batista F.D. Cerundolo V. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have focused on the affinity of binding of the iNKT TCR to human CD1d (hCD1d)-glycosphingolipid (GSL) complexes by ensemble-averaged methods such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and flow cytometry, the interaction forces that govern the bond stability have not been determined. To address this issue, measurements of the binding strength between the iNKT TCR and hCD1d molecules loaded with GSLs were performed using an atomic force microscope.Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was originally invented as a powerful technique for imaging at the atomic scale (9Binnig G. Quate C.F. Gerber C. Phys. Rev.

Protoc. 2007; 2: 2191-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). An additional feature of AFM is the possibility to measure single molecular receptor/ligand forces (11Florin E.L. Moy V.T.

Among this, heat shock proteins, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and efficiently trigger cellular responses, were localized on stressed and unstressed endothelial cells (20Pfister G.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the interaction of LFA-1 (leukocyte function-associated antigen-1) expressed on Jurkat T cells with ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and ICAM-2 was investigated (21Wojcikiewicz E.P. Abdulreda M.H. Zhang X. Moy V.T. Biomacromolecules. 2006; 7: 3188-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In other recent studies, ALCAM (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule)-mediated interactions were characterized with respect to their biochemical and biophysical properties (22Te Riet J. Zimmerman A.W. Cambi A. Joosten B. Speller S. Torensma R. van Leeuwen F.N. Figdor C.G. de Lange F. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3965-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the kinetics of synapse formation was directly followed by probing interaction forces between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (23Hosseini B.H. Louban I. Djandji D. Wabnitz G.H. Deeg J. Bulbuc N. Samstag Y. Gunzer M. Spatz J.P. Hämmerling G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17852-17857Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).In this work, we assessed and compared the dissociation kinetics of TCR binding to CD1d molecules loaded with either αGalCer or OCH12, by stressing the bonds under applied external force ramps using the AFM variant single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) on living cells. In addition, kinetic on-rates were deduced by measuring the binding probability at different dwell times of the AFM probe above the surface.DISCUSSIONUtilizing molecule force spectroscopy, specific recognition events between the iNKT TCR and hCD1d-GSL complexes were analyzed to reveal the interaction forces and the kinetic rate constants that govern the bond stability. To characterize the interaction forces between the iNKT TCR and hCD1d complexes due to different affinities for the iNKT TCR (i.e. loaded with either αGalCer or OCH12), the receptor was attached to an AFM tip via a flexible polyethylene glycol linker, enabling force measurements to be done in vitro and in vivo. The same iNKT TCR-coated tip was used in each particular experiment for probing the specific interactions of both complexes, CD1d-αGalCer and CD1d-OCH12.The force spectroscopy results obtained in this work indicate that the kinetic rate constants for the iNKT TCR/CD1d-αGalCer and iNKT TCR/CD1d-OCH12 complexes, kon and koff, are in good agreement with data previously derived from SPR experiments (Table 1). We found the kinetic off-rates from the living cell measurements to be koff = 0.50 ± 0.52 s−1 for αGalCer and 1.04 ± 1 s−1 for OCH12, which compare very favorably with SPR data: 0.39 ± 0.01 s−1 for αGalCer and 1.00 ± 0.12 s−1 for OCH12 (8McCarthy C. Shepherd D. Fleire S. Stronge V.S. Koch M. Illarionov P.A. Bossi G. Salio M. Denkberg G. Reddington F. Tarlton A. Reddy B.G. Schmidt R.R. Reiter Y. Griffiths G.M. van der Merwe P.A. Besra G.S. Jones E.Y. Batista F.D. Cerundolo V. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We observed that the rate of dissociation of CD1d-OCH12 from the receptor is ∼2-fold larger than that of CD1d-αGalCer. In addition, the kinetic off-rate values from the isolated molecule measurements are relatively close compared with those from the living cell experiments. The larger dissociation rate on isolated molecules can be attributed to complex instability in vitro, allowing us to conclude that CD1d-GSL complexes are more stable on living cells under physiological conditions than when isolated in solution.In contrast to the koff values, the values for kon determined by SMFS measurements appear to be scaled down by about an order of magnitude with respect to the values reported from SPR (Table 1). This discrepancy can be explained on the basis of the rough estimate of the critical parameter represented by the effective volume (i.e. effective radius), leading to a source of errors in determining the true kinetic on-rate value from SMFS measurements. On the other hand, kon values from SPR experiments are often scrutinized by surface rebinding effects. The kon ratio between CD1d-αGalCer and CD1d-OCH12 is comparable (∼8), however, for both SMFS and SPR. Therefore, it appears that the dissociation constant, Kd, follows the same trend (see Table 1).At the same loading rate, higher unbinding forces are required to dissociate the iNKT TCR from the CD1d-αGalCer complex than from the CD1d-OCH12 complex for both isolated molecules and living cells, suggesting that CD1d-αGalCer is more resistant to the external forces compared with OCH12. This finding is consistent with previous results (8McCarthy C. Shepherd D. Fleire S. Stronge V.S. Koch M. Illarionov P.A. Bossi G. Salio M. Denkberg G. Reddington F. Tarlton A. Reddy B.G. Schmidt R.R. Reiter Y. Griffiths G.M. van der Merwe P.A. Besra G.S. Jones E.Y. Batista F.D. Cerundolo V. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) that analyzed the role of the phytosphingosine chain length of the lipids in modulating the binding affinity of CD1d molecules for the iNKT TCR.Furthermore, this study emphasizes the advantage of the SMFS technique by which critical parameters can be determined directly on living cells. These results with living cells were compared with our values obtained in isolated systems and with SPR as a different method for reference. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time on living cells that the interaction strength, kinetic off-rate, and affinity of the iNKT TCR depend on phytosphingosine chain length.

As a control mimicking TFoF1 with the down-state ϵ, we used a mutant ϵΔc-TFoF1, in which ϵ lacks C-terminal helices (27Feniouk B.A. Suzuki T. Yoshida M. J. Biol.

Comparison of nucleotide specificity of wild-type TFoF1 (WT-TFoF1) and ϵΔc-TFoF1 in NTP (ATP, GTP, UTP, or CTP) synthesis reactions in the presence of hexokinase suggests that, when ϵ adopts the up-state conformation, TFoF1 gains higher nucleotide specificity to ATP. Results of NTP-driven proton pumping by ϵΔc-TFoF1 and NTP synthesis in the presence of adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) by TFoF1 are interpreted consistently by the above contention.DISCUSSIONThe ϵ-subunit has been long known as an intrinsic inhibitor of ATPase activity of F1 and FoF1. Recent studies revealed that ϵ can adopt two conformations, and the up-state conformation is responsible for the inhibition. Furthermore, it was found that ATP can bind to and stabilizes the down-state ϵ in some bacteria (13Feniouk B.A. Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we added another novel aspect of the functions of ϵ, that is, modulation of nucleotide specificity. Given that AMP-PNP would stabilize the down-state ϵ in TFoF1 under the experimental conditions, we can indicate that the native TFoF1 of Bacillus PS3 might also modulate nucleotide specificity by ϵ at a physiological temperature (Fig. 4). As well, ϵ is likely to modulates nucleotide specificity in ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5).From a structural aspect, higher nucleotide specificity of TFoF1 with the up-state ϵ is not surprising because the residues of the C-terminal region of ϵ can reach the location close to the catalytic site when C-terminal helices of the up-state ϵ are extended like a long arm into the inside of α3β3 ring. We think it is likely because the introduced cysteines at βLys334 near the catalytic site and ϵGlu131 at the third position from the C terminus can form a disulfide cross-link when ϵ is up-state in the absence of nucleotide. 3T. Suzuki, C. Wakabayashi, K. Tanaka, B. A. Feniouk, and M. Yoshida, unpublished observations. In the actively growing E. coli cell, cellular ATP concentration is in the range of ∼3 mm (26Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1st Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C1987: 445-473Google Scholar) and concentrations of other three NTPs are estimated to be ∼1.5 mm or 0.7–1.2 mm (GTP), and ∼0.7 mm (UTP and CTP) (37Bagnara A.S. Finch L.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Morikawa M. Izui K. Taguchi M. Katsuki H. J. Biochem. 1980; 87: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, hydrolysis of the three NTPs by FoF1 with the down-state ϵ and, synthesis as well, can occur in the cell. Although its physiological significance is yet unclear, it is tempting to speculate that ϵ acts as an ATP-dependent switch that changes the mode of the enzyme operation. When the cell energy becomes poor and ATP concentration drops, TFoF1 would limit ATP and GTP consumption, and the synthesis activity is restricted to ATP.In summary, our results suggest that the ϵ-subunit of FoF1-ATP synthase from a thermophilic Bacillus regulates not only magnitude of activity but also modulates specificity of substrate nucleotide both in synthesis and hydrolysis reactions, depending on its extended and retracted conformations.

These values obviously are lower than the normal cellular ATP concentration of bacteria (∼3 mm in E. coli) (26Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1st Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C1987: 445-473Google Scholar). Therefore, the function of C-terminal helices is assumed as “emergency brake” to prevent ATP hydrolysis, which works only when cellular ATP concentration decreased drastically under severely starving conditions (25Feniouk B.A. Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Suzuki T. Biophys. J. 2010; 98: 434-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Feniouk B.A. Suzuki T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 764-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These contentions have been deduced mostly from analysis of ATP hydrolysis, and here, we studied the effect of conformational state of ϵ on ATP synthesis. As we have shown previously (20Suzuki T. Murakami T. Iino R. Suzuki J. Ono S. Shirakihara Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46840-46846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Iino R. Murakami T. Iizuka S. Kato-Yamada Y. Suzuki T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40130-40134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), ϵ in TF1 is predominantly in the up-state when ATP in the solution is eliminated by hexokinase. As a control mimicking TFoF1 with the down-state ϵ, we used a mutant ϵΔc-TFoF1, in which ϵ lacks C-terminal helices (27Feniouk B.A. Suzuki T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 764-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 501-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Konno H. Suzuki T. Bald D. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Masaike T. Suzuki T. Tsunoda S.P. Konno H. Yoshida M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Comparison of nucleotide specificity of wild-type TFoF1 (WT-TFoF1) and ϵΔc-TFoF1 in NTP (ATP, GTP, UTP, or CTP) synthesis reactions in the presence of hexokinase suggests that, when ϵ adopts the up-state conformation, TFoF1 gains higher nucleotide specificity to ATP. Results of NTP-driven proton pumping by ϵΔc-TFoF1 and NTP synthesis in the presence of adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) by TFoF1 are interpreted consistently by the above contention. DISCUSSIONThe ϵ-subunit has been long known as an intrinsic inhibitor of ATPase activity of F1 and FoF1. Recent studies revealed that ϵ can adopt two conformations, and the up-state conformation is responsible for the inhibition. Furthermore, it was found that ATP can bind to and stabilizes the down-state ϵ in some bacteria (13Feniouk B.A. Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we added another novel aspect of the functions of ϵ, that is, modulation of nucleotide specificity. Given that AMP-PNP would stabilize the down-state ϵ in TFoF1 under the experimental conditions, we can indicate that the native TFoF1 of Bacillus PS3 might also modulate nucleotide specificity by ϵ at a physiological temperature (Fig. 4). As well, ϵ is likely to modulates nucleotide specificity in ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5).From a structural aspect, higher nucleotide specificity of TFoF1 with the up-state ϵ is not surprising because the residues of the C-terminal region of ϵ can reach the location close to the catalytic site when C-terminal helices of the up-state ϵ are extended like a long arm into the inside of α3β3 ring. We think it is likely because the introduced cysteines at βLys334 near the catalytic site and ϵGlu131 at the third position from the C terminus can form a disulfide cross-link when ϵ is up-state in the absence of nucleotide. 3T. Suzuki, C. Wakabayashi, K. Tanaka, B. A. Feniouk, and M. Yoshida, unpublished observations. In the actively growing E. coli cell, cellular ATP concentration is in the range of ∼3 mm (26Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1st Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C1987: 445-473Google Scholar) and concentrations of other three NTPs are estimated to be ∼1.5 mm or 0.7–1.2 mm (GTP), and ∼0.7 mm (UTP and CTP) (37Bagnara A.S. Finch L.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 36: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Morikawa M. Izui K. Taguchi M. Katsuki H. J. Biochem. 1980; 87: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, hydrolysis of the three NTPs by FoF1 with the down-state ϵ and, synthesis as well, can occur in the cell. Although its physiological significance is yet unclear, it is tempting to speculate that ϵ acts as an ATP-dependent switch that changes the mode of the enzyme operation. When the cell energy becomes poor and ATP concentration drops, TFoF1 would limit ATP and GTP consumption, and the synthesis activity is restricted to ATP.In summary, our results suggest that the ϵ-subunit of FoF1-ATP synthase from a thermophilic Bacillus regulates not only magnitude of activity but also modulates specificity of substrate nucleotide both in synthesis and hydrolysis reactions, depending on its extended and retracted conformations.

https://openalex.org/W1982104566,"The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a well established model organism for studying numerous aspects of cellular and developmental functions. Its ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is encoded in an extrachromosomal palindrome that exists in ∼100 copies in the cell. In this study, we have set out to investigate the sequence of the expressed rRNA. For this, we have ligated the rRNA ends and performed RT-PCR on these circular RNAs. Sequencing revealed that the mature 26 S, 17 S, 5.8 S, and 5 S rRNAs have sizes of 3741, 1871, 162, and 112 nucleotides, respectively. Unlike the published data, all mature rRNAs of the same type uniformly display the same start and end nucleotides in the analyzed AX2 strain. We show the existence of a short lived primary transcript covering the rRNA transcription unit of 17 S, 5.8 S, and 26 S rRNA. Northern blots and RT-PCR reveal that from this primary transcript two precursor molecules of the 17 S and two precursors of the 26 S rRNA are generated. We have also determined the sequences of these precursor molecules, and based on these data, we propose a model for the maturation of the rRNAs in Dictyostelium discoideum that we compare with the processing of the rRNA transcription unit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae."
