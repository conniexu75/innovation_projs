Mesenchymal-type movement is characterized by an elongated cellular morphology and requires extracellular proteolysis. In amoeboid movement, cells have a rounded morphology, are less dependent on proteases, and require high Rho-kinase signaling to drive elevated levels of actomyosin contractility. These two modes of cell movement are interconvertible. We show that mesenchymal-type movement in melanoma cells is driven by activation of the GTPase Rac through a complex containing NEDD9, a recently identified melanoma metastasis gene, and DOCK3, a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Rac signals through WAVE2 to direct mesenchymal movement and suppress amoeboid movement through decreasing actomyosin contractility. Conversely, in amoeboid movement, Rho-kinase signaling activates a Rac GAP, ARHGAP22, that suppresses mesenchymal movement by inactivating Rac. We demonstrate tight interplay between Rho and Rac in determining different modes of tumor cell movement, revealing how tumor cells switch between different modes of movement.

Abnormal cell migration and invasion is a characteristic of malignant cancer cells and is one component of metastasis, the major clinical problem in cancer. To metastasize, tumor cells must move through tissues and cross tissue boundaries, which requires cell motility, remodeling of cell-cell contacts, and interactions with the extracellular matrix (Fidler, 1999Fidler I.J. Critical determinants of cancer metastasis: Rationale for therapy.Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 43: S3-S10Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Tumor cells can move as individual cells or as collective groups (Wolf et al., 2007Wolf K. Wu Y.I. Liu Y. Geiger J. Tam E. Overall C. Stack M.S. Friedl P. Multi-step pericellular proteolysis controls the transition from individual to collective cancer cell invasion.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Recent work has demonstrated that individual tumor cells have two different modes of movement: a mesenchymal mode characterized by an elongated morphology that requires extracellular proteolysis localized at cellular protrusions and an amoeboid mode in which movement is independent of proteases and cells have a rounded morphology with no obvious polarity (Wolf et al., 2003Wolf K. Mazo I. Leung H. Engelke K. von Andrian U.H. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. Brocker E.B. Friedl P. Compensation mechanism in tumor cell migration: Mesenchymal-amoeboid transition after blocking of pericellular proteolysis.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). In amoeboid movement, the cell surface undergoes very active blebbing driven by actomyosin contractility (Sahai and Marshall, 2003Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Differing modes of tumour cell invasion have distinct requirements for Rho/ROCK signalling and extracellular proteolysis.Nat.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1515-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). It is also clear that these two modes of tumor cell movement are interconvertible, depending on environmental conditions (De Wever et al., 2004De Wever O. Nguyen Q.D. Van Hoorde L. Bracke M. Bruyneel E. Gespach C. Mareel M. Tenascin-C and SF/HGF produced by myofibroblasts in vitro provide convergent pro-invasive signals to human colon cancer cells through RhoA and Rac.FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1016-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, Wolf et al., 2003Wolf K. Mazo I. Leung H. Engelke K. von Andrian U.H. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. Brocker E.B. Friedl P. Compensation mechanism in tumor cell migration: Mesenchymal-amoeboid transition after blocking of pericellular proteolysis.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Consequently, the ability of tumor cells to switch between different modes of motility may limit the effectiveness of single therapeutic agents aimed at reducing invasion. Members of the Rho family of small GTPases are key regulators of cell movement through their actions on actin assembly, actomyosin contractility, and microtubules (Ridley, 2001Ridley A.J. Rho GTPases and cell migration.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Rho family proteins is deregulated in some tumors and correlates with progression of disease (Sahai and Marshall, 2002Sahai E. Marshall C.J. RHO-GTPases and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). The three prototypical members of the family, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, have all been linked to cell movement. Rac1 drives motility by promoting lamellipodia formation (Ridley et al., 1992Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. The small GTP-binding protein rac regulates growth factor-induced membrane ruffling.Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar), whereas RhoA signals to the kinases ROCKI and II, promoting the formation of actin stress fibers and generation of the actomyosin contractile force required for cell movement (Amano et al., 1997Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions enhanced by Rho-kinase.Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, Kimura et al., 1996Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M.

Previous work shows that amoeboid and mesenchymal modes of movement are distinguished by their different usage of signaling pathways. The amoeboid mode involves signaling through ROCK, whereas the mesenchymal mode does not have an obligate requirement for ROCK but requires extracellular proteolysis (Sahai and Marshall, 2003Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Differing modes of tumour cell invasion have distinct requirements for Rho/ROCK signalling and extracellular proteolysis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) for Rac-dependent actin protrusions to be pushed through channels in the extracellular matrix (Wolf et al., 2003Wolf K. Mazo I. Leung H. Engelke K. von Andrian U.H. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. Brocker E.B. Friedl P. Compensation mechanism in tumor cell migration: Mesenchymal-amoeboid transition after blocking of pericellular proteolysis.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Amoeboid movement is characterized by high levels of actomyosin contractility driven by ROCK (Wilkinson et al., 2005Wilkinson S. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Cdc42-MRCK and Rho-ROCK signalling cooperate in myosin phosphorylation and cell invasion.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), consistent with a mechanism whereby cells squeeze through voids and deform the matrix (Wolf et al., 2003Wolf K. Mazo I.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1515-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To investigate mechanisms of different modes of cell movement, we have studied how the regulation of Rho family GTPases determines the mode of tumor cell movement. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase accelerating proteins (GAPs) are key regulators of small GTPases, with GEFs promoting activation to the GTP bound state and GAPs promoting inactivation by stimulating GTP hydrolysis (Bos et al., 2007Bos J.L. Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. GEFs and GAPs: Critical elements in the control of small G proteins.Cell. 2007; 129: 865-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). We carried out a systematic siRNA screen of GEFs and GAPs to identify regulators of Rho family GTPases affecting modes of tumor cell movement. We show that a Rac-specific GEF, DOCK3, in association with the adaptor molecule NEDD9, regulates Rac and WAVE2 to drive mesenchymal movement and suppress amoeboid movement. Conversely, in amoeboid movement, Rho signaling via ROCK to a Rac GAP, ARHGAP22, inactivates Rac and suppresses mesenchymal movement. To investigate Rho family GTPase signaling pathways involved in tumor cell morphology and movement, we initially used A375M2 melanoma cells that show amoeboid movement in vivo (Pinner and Sahai, 2008Pinner S. Sahai E. PDK1 regulates cancer cell motility by antagonising inhibition of ROCK1 by RhoE.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and in 3D tissue culture (Sahai and Marshall, 2003Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Differing modes of tumour cell invasion have distinct requirements for Rho/ROCK signalling and extracellular proteolysis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, Wilkinson et al., 2005Wilkinson S. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Cdc42-MRCK and Rho-ROCK signalling cooperate in myosin phosphorylation and cell invasion.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on top of a thick deformable layer of collagen I, and cell morphology and movement were monitored by time-lapse microscopy. In this system, cell adhesion is at least partially dependent on integrin β1 (Figure S1A available online,) and cells show similar adhesion to when plated on a thin, rigid layer of collagen (Figure S1B). Approximately 90% of A375M2 cells displayed a rounded morphology on thick collagen (Figures 1A and 1B, Movie S1), and higher magnifications show that any one time about 20% of the rounded cells move randomly in an amoeboid fashion with dynamic blebbing plasma membranes (Movie S2, Figure 2F) with velocities of approximately 0.1 μm per min. These velocities of amoeboid movement on top of a deformable collagen layer are similar to those observed in a 3D collagen environment (Figure S1C). About 10% of A375M2 cells show an elongated morphology (Figures 1A and 1B), and of these about 40% are moving in a mesenchymal fashion with long protrusions at speeds similar to amoeboid cells (Figures 1D and 2F). Treatment with cytochalasin D to block actin polymerization showed that both amoeboid movement and elongated, mesenchymal-type movement require actin assembly (data not shown).Figure 2Rac Regulates the Amoeboid-Mesenchymal TransitionShow full caption(A) Left panels: images of A375M2 cells transfected with siRNAs or treated with 50 μM NSC23766, photographed at 24 hr on collagen.

To examine the interconvertibility of cell morphologies and movement, we made time-lapse movies from reconstructions of confocal sections of cells contained within a 3D collagen matrix (Movie S3). These showed that individual A375M2 cells interconvert between a rounded and elongated morphology over a 24 hr time period. Examination of other melanoma cell lines on thick collagen showed that several were like A375M2, consisting of a majority of rounded cells that move in an amoeboid fashion; another group had similar proportions of rounded and elongated cells, whereas a third group consisted of a majority of elongated cells with mesenchymal-type movement (Figure S1D). To identify GEFs that regulate cell morphology and movement, we transfected A375M2 cells with siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes (Dharmacon Smart Pools) targeting 83 GEFs for Rho family GTPases (Table S1) and monitored them on thick collagen layers. Silencing of DOCK3/MOCA resulted in almost complete elimination of cells with an elongated morphology and blocked the interconversion between amoeboid and mesenchymal movement (Figures 1A and 1B) without affecting adhesive properties (Figure S1B, lower panel). We have previously shown that treatment of A375M2 cells with low concentrations of the myosin II ATPase inhibitor blebbistatin resulting in partial inhibition of actomyosin contractility leads to an elongated morphology and mesenchymal movement (Wilkinson et al., 2005Wilkinson S. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Cdc42-MRCK and Rho-ROCK signalling cooperate in myosin phosphorylation and cell invasion.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated whether this conversion requires DOCK3. Furthermore, because Rho-ROCK signaling to phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) has been shown to be a key determinant of actomyosin contractility, we investigated whether inhibition of ROCK led to an elongated morphology and whether this was dependent on DOCK3. Figure 1B shows that treatment with blebbistatin or two different ROCK inhibitors (Y27632 and H1152) resulted in conversion to elongated cells moving in a mesenchymal manner (Movies S6 and S7) and that this was abrogated by siRNAs targeting DOCK3 (Figure 1B; Movie S8). These results were confirmed with Dharmacon “On-Target Plus” oligonucleotides, which use a modified chemistry to reduce off-target effects and are directed at different sequences of the gene (Figure 1C). Interestingly, although blebbistatin or ROCK inhibition increased the proportion of elongated cells, it did not affect the speed of migration (Figure 1D). Knockdown of other GEFs from the DBL or the DOCK families did not affect cell elongation in response to ROCK inhibition (Figure S2). DOCK3 has been previously characterized as a GEF for Rac (Namekata et al., 2004Namekata K. Enokido Y. Iwasawa K. Kimura H. MOCA induces membrane spreading by activating Rac1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14331-14337Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated whether the conversion from amoeboid to mesenchymal movement involved the activation of Rac. Silencing of DOCK3 expression with two different oligonucleotides showed that Rac activity in A375M2 is dependent on DOCK3 (Figure 1E). Moreover, expression of an internal deletion mutant, DELDOCK3 (aa 1062–1393) (Namekata et al., 2004Namekata K. Enokido Y. Iwasawa K. Kimura H. MOCA induces membrane spreading by activating Rac1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14331-14337Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which lacks the DHR2 exchange factor domain but retains protein-protein interaction domains and could act as a dominant negative, also decreased Rac activation (Figure 1E, lower panel) and blocked the conversion of rounded cells to elongated morphology (Figure S3). To determine whether Rac activation is required for the amoeboid-mesenchymal transition, we silenced Rac1 by siRNA transfection. Figures 2A and 2C and Movies S4 and S9 show that silencing of Rac1 abolished elongation of A375M2 cells. To confirm these results, we used treatment with compound NSC23766, which blocks Rac1 activation by interfering with complex formation between GEFs and Rac (Gao et al., 2004Gao Y. Dickerson J.B. Guo F. Zheng J. Zheng Y. Rational design and characterization of a Rac GTPase-specific small molecule inhibitor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7618-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) or expression of the interfering Rac mutant Rac1T17N. NSC23766 treatment reduced the proportion of elongated cells to 1.5%, compared with 8% in control A375M2 cells (Figure 2A). Because NSC23766 has not been shown to affect Rac activation mediated by DOCK family members, we showed that NSC23766 blocks Rac activation after overexpression of DOCK3 (Figure S4). Only rounded cells were found to express Rac1T17N after transfection (data not shown). To determine whether cell elongation after inhibition of actomyosin contractility or ROCK led to Rac activation, we measured Rac-GTP levels after treatment with blebbistatin or ROCK inhibitors. Figure 2B shows that these treatments increase Rac activation. This activation of Rac is dependent on DOCK3 (data not shown). However, treatment with ROCK inhibitors or blebbistatin did not increase the proportion of elongated cells if Rac had been depleted by siRNA (Figure 2C) or by Rac1T17N transfection (data not shown). A375M2 was derived from a low metastatic melanoma cell line, A375P (Clark et al., 2000Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Genomic analysis of metastasis reveals an essential role for RhoC.Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar), that has a more elongated morphology (40% elongated) with fewer blebs than A375M2 cells (Figure 2D). Interestingly, we could show that A375P cells have lower levels of Rho-GTP and higher levels of Rac-GTP than do A375M2 cells (Figure 2E). In A375P cell lines stably expressing either Rac1T17N or shRNA-Rac1, the proportion of elongated cells was reduced (Figure 2D). These results show that Rac signaling is required for the elongated/mesenchymal phenotype. Because amoeboid movement of A375M2 cells is dependent on ROCK (Sahai and Marshall, 2003Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Differing modes of tumour cell invasion have distinct requirements for Rho/ROCK signalling and extracellular proteolysis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) but inhibition of ROCK leads to Rac-dependent mesenchymal-type movement, we investigated whether inhibition of ROCK in combination with blockage of Rac activation would prevent cells from moving. Figure 2F shows that the combination of ROCK-inhibitor treatment with silencing of either Rac or DOCK3 markedly reduces cell movement. To determine whether activation of Rac signaling is sufficient to convert rounded cells to elongated cells, we expressed a constitutively activated Rac1 Q61L in A375M2 cells; this resulted in the proportion of elongated cells increasing to 40%, compared to 4% in controls (Figure 2G). These experiments show that activation of Rac by DOCK3 in A375M2 cells results in an elongated morphology and mesenchymal movement but do not address the issue of whether Rac is required for amoeboid movement. Movie S9 shows that cells in which Rac has been silenced move solely in an amoeboid fashion. Time-lapse movies from reconstructions of confocal sections of A375M2 cells suspended within a collagen matrix show that blockage of Rac signaling either by siRNA transfection or treatment with NSCC2376 prevents conversion of rounded, amoeboid cells to elongated mesenchymal-type movement (Movies S4 and S5; compare with control cells in Movie S3). Surprisingly, analysis of the speed of cells plated on top of a collagen matrix showed that rounded cells in which Rac signaling was ablated moved up to 1.7-fold faster (Figure 2H). These results demonstrate that not only is Rac activation by DOCK3 required for an elongated morphology and mesenchymal movement, but it also suppresses amoeboid movement. DOCK3 is a member of the DOCK180 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and individual members of the family activate either Rac or Cdc42 (Cote and Vuori, 2002Cote J.F. Vuori K. Identification of an evolutionarily conserved superfamily of DOCK180-related proteins with guanine nucleotide exchange activity.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The prototypical member of this family, DOCK180, is activated via a complex consisting of the adaptors Crk and p130Cas (Kiyokawa et al., 1998Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Activation of Rac1 by a Crk SH3-binding protein, DOCK180.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We speculated that DOCK3 may complex with a member of the p130Cas family. Expression studies by Q-PCR showed that p130Cas and NEDD9/HEF1 but not Efs/Sin were expressed in A375M2 human melanoma cells. Interestingly, NEDD9 is overexpressed in 35%–50% of metastatic human melanomas and is overexpressed and involved in invasion in a mouse model of metastatic melanoma (Kim et al., 2006Kim M. Gans J.D. Nogueira C. Wang A. Paik J.H. Feng B. Brennan C. Hahn W.C. Cordon-Cardo C. Wagner S.N. et al.Comparative oncogenomics identifies NEDD9 as a melanoma metastasis gene.Cell. 2006; 125: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To investigate the roles of NEDD9 and p130Cas, we examined whether silencing of expression of p130Cas or NEDD9 caused a similar phenotype to silencing of DOCK3 expression. NEDD9 but not p130Cas ablation reduced the number of elongated cells after treatment with ROCK inhibitors (Figure 3A; knockdown in Figure S5A). To show that NEDD9 is required for Rac activation, we transfected A375M2 with siRNA oligonucleotides. Figure 3B shows that silencing NEDD9 expression reduces Rac activity. To confirm that Rac activation by DOCK3 requires NEDD9, we overexpressed DOCK3 in HEK293T cells. Figure 3C shows that overexpression of DOCK3 led to Rac activation that was blocked by silencing of endogenous NEDD9 (knockdown in Figure S5C). Similarly, Rac activation by overexpressed NEDD9 was dependent on endogenous DOCK3 (Figure 3C, knockdown in Figure S5D). These results suggest that DOCK3 functions together with NEDD9 to activate Rac. Therefore, we used coimmunoprecipitation to look for evidence that NEDD9 and DOCK3 are in a signaling complex. We were able to detect an endogenous complex of DOCK3 with NEDD9 in A375M2 cells (Figure 3D). These results were confirmed by overexpression analysis; endogenous DOCK3 was found in immunoprecipitates isolated with Flag-tag antibodies from cells expressing Flag-epitope-tagged NEDD9 (Figure 3D, lower-left panel), whereas endogenous NEDD9 could be detected in complexes with HADOCK3 after expression of an HA-epitope-tagged DOCK3 (Figure 3D). Because amoeboid movement is associated with elevated levels of MLC2 phosphorylation and actomyosin contractility, we investigated whether Rac acts by controlling actomyosin contractility. Reduction of Rac1 expression with Rac1 siRNA in A375M2 cells (Figure 4A) or Rac1 shRNA in A375P cells (Figure 4B) increased phosphorylation of MLC2 on threonine18 and serine19. Similarly, silencing of DOCK3 or NEDD9 led to increased MLC2 phosphorylation (Figures 4C and 4D). Conversely, expression of constitutively activated Rac1Q61L in A375M2 cells that leads to an elongated morphology resulted in reduced levels of MLC2 phosphorylation (data not shown). These results show that Rac negatively regulates MLC2 phosphorylation and thereby actomyosin contractility. To find the Rac effector responsible for regulating MLC2 phosphorylation, we used siRNAs targeting the Rac effectors PAK1, 2, 3, and 4 as well as WAVE1, 2, and 3; only WAVE2 depletion led to elevated levels of MLC2 phosphorylation (Figure 4E). Consistent with its role in Rac-dependent Arp2/3 promotion of actin assembly and the formation of cell protrusions characteristic of the mesenchymal type of cell movement (Leng et al., 2005Leng Y. Zhang J. Badour K. Arpaia E. Freeman S. Cheung P. Siu M. Siminovitch K. Abelson-interactor-1 promotes WAVE2 membrane translocation and Abelson-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation required for WAVE2 activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 1098-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), WAVE2 silencing reduced the proportion of elongated A375M2 cells on thick collagen (data not shown) and abolished Rac-dependent elongation after ROCK inhibition (Figure 4F). We were not able to detect any defect in elongation after ROCK inhibition or change in the levels of MLC2 phosphorylation when depleting WAVE1 or WAVE3 (Figure S6). To confirm the results obtained for WAVE2, we used individual Dharmacon On-Target Plus oligos targeting different regions of WAVE2. As shown in Figure 4G, there is a strong correlation between the degree of knockdown for WAVE2 protein and the reduction in the percentage of elongated cells after ROCK-inhibitor treatment. These results therefore show that elongation of A375M2 cells requires Rac signaling to WAVE2 and that WAVE2 negatively regulates MLC2 phosphorylation, thereby suppressing rounded morphology and amoeboid movement. We have shown that Rac opposes amoeboid movement while inhibition of ROCK in amoeboid cells leads to Rac activation, suggesting that ROCK signaling in rounded, amoeboid cells suppresses Rac activation. A potential mechanism is through ROCK regulation of a Rac GAP (Ohta et al., 2006Ohta Y. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. FilGAP, a Rho- and ROCK-regulated GAP for Rac binds filamin A to control actin remodelling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We investigated whether a Rac GAP regulates the mesenchymal transition by screening an siRNA library consisting of 72 Rho family GAPs (Table S2). Silencing of ARHGAP22 led to elongation of A375M2 rounded cells (Figures 5A and 5B, kd in Figure S5B) without altering the adhesion properties of the cells (Figure S1B, lower panel). We did not observe this increase in the number of elongated cells when knocking down the expression of GAPs belonging to the same subfamily such as ARHGAP24 or ARHGAP25 or other GAPs (Figure S7).

To better understand the functions of GPCRs in vivo, we quantified transcript levels of 353 nonodorant GPCRs in 41 adult mouse tissues. Cluster analysis placed many GPCRs into anticipated anatomical and functional groups and predicted previously unidentified roles for less-studied receptors. From one such prediction, we showed that the Gpr91 ligand succinate can regulate lipolysis in white adipose tissue, suggesting that signaling by this citric acid cycle intermediate may regulate energy homeostasis. We also showed that pairwise analysis of GPCR expression across tissues may help predict drug side effects. This resource will aid studies to understand GPCR function in vivo and may assist in the identification of therapeutic targets."

Recent evidence suggests that some molecular defects in autism may interfere with the mechanisms of synaptic protein synthesis. We propose that aberrant synaptic protein synthesis may represent one possible pathway leading to autistic phenotypes, including cognitive impairment and savant abilities. Autism is a complex genetic disorder, but single-gene disorders with a high prevalence of autism offer insight into its pathogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that some molecular defects in autism may interfere with the mechanisms of synaptic protein synthesis. We propose that aberrant synaptic protein synthesis may represent one possible pathway leading to autistic phenotypes, including cognitive impairment and savant abilities. In 1943, Kanner described 11 children affected by a unique disorder that he designated “early infantile autism” (Kanner, 1943Kanner L. Nervous Child. 1943; 2: 217-250Google Scholar). It has since become clear that autism is comprised of a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders, collectively termed “autism spectrum disorders” (ASDs), that share common features of impaired social relationships, impaired language and communication, and limited range of interests and behavior. Cognitive impairment is common in autism, and ∼70% of autistic individuals suffer from mental retardation (Fombonne, 1999Fombonne E. Psychol. Med. 1999; 29: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Neuropathological studies have reported minor and inconsistent abnormalities in the autistic brain, but recent morphometric analysis has demonstrated enlargement of the hippocampus and amygdala (Schumann et al., 2004Schumann C.M. Hamstra J. Goodlin-Jones B.L. Lotspeich L.J. Kwon H. Buonocore M.H. Lammers C.R. Reiss A.L. Amaral D.G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6392-6401Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). As first noted by Kanner, a high prevalence of macrocephaly is observed among children with ASDs, possibly due to an early period of excessive brain growth (Courchesne et al., 2004Courchesne E. Redcay E. Kennedy D.P. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2004; 17: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Remarkably, as many as 10% of autistic individuals paradoxically exhibit restricted domains of normal or even superior skills, termed “savant abilities,” on a background of cognitive disability (Heaton and Wallace, 2004Heaton P. Wallace G.L. J. Child Psychol. Psychiatry. 2004; 45: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Savant syndrome can involve excellence in a variety of cognitive or artistic domains, but declarative memory is most consistently accentuated. Autism is among the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, and available evidence points to a complex genetic basis (Persico and Bourgeron, 2006Persico A.M. Bourgeron T. Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 349-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, several disorders caused by single-gene mutations are associated with autism, often accompanied by cognitive impairment (Table 1). In these disorders, a substantial proportion of affected individuals meet diagnostic criteria for ASDs, reflecting a greatly increased risk of autism conferred by the mutation. Conversely, a small but significant percentage of children presenting with ASDs carry mutations in one of these genes. Although such monogenic disorders collectively account for a minority of cases of autism (10%–15%), the molecular alterations in these disorders may identify common pathogenic pathways shared by ASDs.Table 1Single-Gene Disorders with High Rates of AutismGeneDisorderRate of AutismRate in AutismMRGene FunctionFMR1Fragile X syndrome15%–30%2%–5%+Translational repressorTSC1/2Tuberous sclerosis complex25%–60%1%–4%+Inhibitor of mTORPTENPTEN hamartoma syndrome (ASD with macrocephaly)ND1%+Inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR signalingNF1Neurofibromatosis type I4%0%–4%+Ras GAPMECP2Rett's syndrome100%2%+Global transcriptional repressorUBE3AAngelman's syndrome40%1%+E3 ubiquitin ligaseCACNA1CTimothy's syndrome60%<1%+L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav1.2)NLGN3/4Familial ASDND<1%+Synaptic adhesionNRXN1Familial ASDND<1%+Synaptic adhesionSHANK3Familial ASD (22q13 microdeletion syndrome)ND<1%+PSD scaffoldingSeveral monogenic human disorders are characterized by cognitive impairment and autism.

MR refers to the association of mental retardation with each disorder. ND indicates that the prevalence of ASDs among individuals carrying mutations in the specified gene has not been determined. The identification of mutations in neuroligins as rare genetic causes of autism suggested that defects in synaptic function may be intimately involved in autism pathogenesis (Zoghbi, 2003Zoghbi H.Y. Science. 2003; 302: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, Persico and Bourgeron, 2006Persico A.M. Bourgeron T. Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 349-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, mouse models of mutations that cause ASDs in humans consistently point to disrupted synaptic function: excessive or diminished excitatory synaptic connectivity (Chao et al., 2007Chao H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 2007; 56: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, Hanson and Madison, 2007Hanson J.E. Madison D.V. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4014-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and alterations in the balance of excitation and inhibition (Dani et al., 2005Dani V.S. Chang Q. Maffei A. Turrigiano G.G. Jaenisch R. Nelson S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 12560-12565Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, Tabuchi et al., 2007Tabuchi K. Blundell J. Etherton M.R. Hammer R.E. Liu X.

It appears that the “autistic neuron” has too many or too few, too strong or too weak, excitatory synapses relative to the level of inhibition. However, mutations in ASDs that directly affect synaptic structure are rare. In this Essay, we focus on recent insights into the function of gene products mutated in several other autistic disorders. We propose that dysregulation of synaptic protein synthesis in these disorders may lead to altered synaptic development and plasticity and autistic phenotypes. The gene products mutated in several single-gene disorders associated with autism act as negative regulators of protein synthesis (Figure 1). Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked form of mental retardation caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene (Bagni and Greenough, 2005Bagni C. Greenough W.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The prevalence of ASDs in FXS is reportedly 15%–30%, and conversely, up to 5% of children presenting with ASDs are found to have FXS. The product of the FMR1 gene, the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), binds to specific mRNAs and represses their translation. FMRP is estimated to interact with more than 400 distinct mRNAs (Brown et al., 2001Brown V. Jin P. Ceman S. Darnell J.C. O'Donnell W.T. Tenenbaum S.A. Jin X. Feng Y. Wilkinson K.D. Keene J.D. et al.Cell. 2001; 107: 477-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Loss of FMRP expression in FXS would be expected to cause translational derepression of these target mRNAs. Indeed, there is a substantial (∼20%) and anatomically widespread increase in the rate of cerebral protein synthesis in the Fmr1 knockout mouse, which models the silencing of FMRP expression responsible for the human disorder (Qin et al., 2005Qin M. Kang J. Burlin T.V. Jiang C. Smith C.B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5087-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in hamartin (TSC1) or tuberin (TSC2) (Kwiatkowski and Manning, 2005Kwiatkowski D.J. Manning B.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14 Spec No. 2: R251-R258Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Central nervous system involvement in TSC is characterized clinically by a high prevalence of ASDs (25%–60%), cognitive impairment, and epilepsy (Wiznitzer, 2004Wiznitzer M. J. Child Neurol. 2004; 19: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). TSC1 and TSC2 form a heterodimeric complex with GAP activity against the small GTP-binding protein Rheb, resulting in inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase (Figure 1). More specifically, TSC1/2 inhibit the activity of the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR-raptor complex (mTORC1). mTORC1, which is activated by a sequential kinase cascade downstream of phosphoinositide-3 (PI3) kinase, is a major regulator of cellular growth in mitotic cells (Wullschleger et al., 2006Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar). One of the principal effector mechanisms of mTORC1 is activation of cap-dependent translation. Recognition of the 5′ mRNA cap by eIF4E, which leads to recruitment of eIF4G and the small ribosomal subunit, is the key regulatory step in translation initiation (Richter and Sonenberg, 2005Richter J.D. Sonenberg N. Nature. 2005; 433: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). A family of eIF4E-binding proteins, 4E-BPs, impedes this process by sequestering eIF4E and blocking its association with eIF4G. Phosphorylation of 4E-BPs by mTORC1 relieves this inhibition, promoting eIF4E release and activation of cap-dependent initiation. Phosphorylation of another mTORC1 substrate, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), also facilitates translation. Inactivation of TSC1/2 in hippocampal neurons upregulates mTORC1 activity (Tavazoie et al., 2005Tavazoie S.F. Alvarez V.A. Ridenour D.A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Sabatini B.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, Meikle et al., 2007Meikle L. Talos D.M. Onda H. Pollizzi K. Rotenberg A. Sahin M. Jensen F.E. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5546-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, Ehninger et al., 2008Ehninger D. Han S. Shilyansky C. Zhou Y. Li W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Ramesh V. Silva A.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), suggesting that loss of TSC1/2 function elicits enhanced translation in neurons. Loss-of-function mutations in another negative regulator of PI3K-mTOR signaling, the PTEN phosphatase, have also been linked to ASD pathogenesis. PTEN antagonizes PI3K-dependent signaling by converting the second messenger PIP3 to PIP2, and loss of PTEN function in neurons leads to heightened mTORC1 activity (Kwon et al., 2006Kwon C.H. Luikart B.W. Powell C.M. Zhou J. Matheny S.A. Zhang W. Li Y. Baker S.J. Parada L.F. Neuron. 2006; 50: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Inactivating mutations in PTEN are responsible for several related familial hamartoma-tumor syndromes, the clinical spectrum of which includes macrocephaly associated with ASDs. Macrocephaly occurs in up to 20% of ASD cases, and PTEN mutations have been identified in ∼5% of ASD patients with macrocephaly (e.g., Butler et al., 2005Butler M.G. Dasouki M.J. Zhou X.P. Talebizadeh Z. Brown M. Takahashi T.N. Miles J.H. Wang C.H. Stratton R. Pilarski R. Eng C. J. Med. Genet. 2005; 42: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The connection between macrocephaly and PTEN mutations is interesting in view of the role of the PI3K-mTOR pathway in regulation of cell size, an effect thought to be mediated through translational control (Backman et al., 2002Backman S. Stambolic V. Mak T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Fingar et al., 2002Fingar D.C. Salama S. Tsou C. Harlow E. Blenis J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1472-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In mitotic cells, activation of this pathway increases cell size, whereas inhibition decreases cell size. It is not clear to what extent macrocephaly in ASD patients may be due to increased neuronal size; however, inactivation of either TSC1/2 or PTEN in mice causes neuronal hypertrophy and macrocephaly (Backman et al., 2002Backman S. Stambolic V. Mak T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, Meikle et al., 2007Meikle L. Talos D.M. Onda H. Pollizzi K. Rotenberg A. Sahin M. Jensen F.E. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5546-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Taken together, the association of mutations in FMRP, TSC1/2, and PTEN with autism suggests that defects in translational repression may represent one possible mechanism leading to autistic phenotypes. It will therefore be of interest to determine whether defects in additional components of such pathways might contribute to autism susceptibility. As in all cells, elaborate mechanisms regulate protein synthesis in neurons to ensure adaptive responses to a changing environment (Kelleher et al., 2004bKelleher 3rd, R.J. Govindarajan A. Tonegawa S. Neuron. 2004; 44: 59-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, Klann and Dever, 2004Klann E. Dever T.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, Sutton and Schuman, 2006Sutton M.A. Schuman E.M. Cell. 2006; 127: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). There is abundant evidence for transcriptional regulation by neuronal activity and by downstream intracellular signals that are integrated in the neuronal cell body. However, patterns of activity at the thousands of synapses on each neuron dictate where and how this mRNA is used to synthesize proteins to fine-tune neuronal function. Markers of mRNA translation suggest that synaptic activity-induced protein synthesis occurs locally at or near dendritic spines in response to the synaptic release of glutamate. Two types of postsynaptic glutamate receptor have been implicated in translational regulation: the Gq-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5 (mGluR1 and 5) and the calcium-permeable NMDA receptors (NMDARs). In addition to activating intracellular signaling pathways, there is evidence that NMDAR activation stimulates release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which can induce neuronal protein synthesis through activation of synaptic TrkB receptors. Excitatory synaptic activity drives translation by activating these receptors, and this process is normally held in check by negative regulators such as FMRP, PTEN, and TSC1/2. Mutations that cause either overactivation of these receptors or decreased negative regulation of protein synthesis knock the system out of balance. We propose that a functional consequence is synaptic dysfunction that may manifest in humans as autism. Protein synthesis in the neuron has been extensively studied in the context of memory formation in adults and, more recently, experience-dependent cortical development. In both contexts, the immediate encoding and storage of information do not require protein synthesis. However, new gene expression is required for these changes to endure for longer than a few hours. Experimental forms of synaptic plasticity display similar temporal and molecular distinctions. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) exhibit persistent late phases (L-LTP and L-LTD, respectively) that require new gene expression and transient early phases (E-LTP and E-LTD, respectively) that are insensitive to inhibitors of transcription and translation. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms mediating this process has highlighted the central importance of translational regulation. The presence of mRNAs and polyribosomes in proximity to synaptic sites suggested that local protein synthesis in dendrites could rapidly supply new gene products to activated synapses. The discoveries that BDNF-induced LTP and mGluR-dependent LTD, both of which require protein synthesis, can be supported by isolated dendrites further suggested a crucial role for translational upregulation in response to synaptic activity (Kang and Schuman, 1996Kang H. Schuman E.M. Science. 1996; 273: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, Huber et al., 2000Huber K.M. Kayser M.S. Bear M.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1254-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Comparison of the effects of transcriptional and translational inhibitors, combined with metabolic labeling, has shown that establishment of L-LTP is mediated by rapid upregulation of the translation of pre-existing mRNAs (Kelleher et al., 2004aKelleher 3rd, R.J. Govindarajan A. Jung H.-Y. Kang H. Tonegawa S. Cell. 2004; 116: 467-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Recent work from several groups has established that the ERK, MAPK, and mTOR signaling pathways couple synaptic activity to the translational machinery during both protein synthesis-dependent LTP and LTD (Figure 1). The ERK pathway, which is activated downstream of NMDAR, mGluR, and TrkB receptors, plays important roles in synaptic plasticity and memory (Sweatt, 2004Sweatt J.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). ERK activation is required for stimulation of cap-dependent translation and phosphorylation of eIF4E, 4E-BPs, and S6 in hippocampal neurons in response to L-LTP induction, NMDAR activation, and BDNF (Kelleher et al., 2004aKelleher 3rd, R.J. Govindarajan A. Jung H.-Y. Kang H. Tonegawa S. Cell. 2004; 116: 467-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of ERK signaling in the hippocampus prevents these translational responses and causes selective deficits in L-LTP and long-term memory. Inhibition of mTORC1 activity in hippocampal neurons attenuates synaptic activity-induced translation, 4E-BP phosphorylation, L-LTP, and BDNF-induced LTP (Tang et al., 2002Tang S.J. Reis G. Kang H. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Schuman E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, Kelleher et al., 2004aKelleher 3rd, R.J. Govindarajan A. Jung H.-Y. Kang H. Tonegawa S. Cell. 2004; 116: 467-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of mGluR1/5 leads to ERK- and mTOR-dependent increases in eIF4E, 4E-BP, and S6 phosphorylation, and inhibition of the ERK or mTOR pathways blocks mGluR-dependent LTD (Gallagher et al., 2004Gallagher S.M. Daly C.A. Bear M.F. Huber K.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4859-4864Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Hou and Klann, 2004Hou L. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6352-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, Banko et al., 2006Banko J.L. Hou L. Poulin F. Sonenberg N. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings support a requirement for ERK- and mTOR-regulated translation in protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity and memory. Analysis of synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of FXS illustrates how loss of the normal constraints on neuronal translation may give rise to synaptic and cognitive impairment. Fmr1 knockout mice display a range of phenotypes reminiscent of the human disorder. Interestingly, mGluR-dependent LTD, which requires translation but not transcription for its expression, is significantly enhanced in the hippocampus of Fmr1 knockout mice (Huber et al., 2002Huber K.M. Gallagher S.M. Warren S.T. Bear M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7746-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Further supporting the view that increased translation of FMRP target mRNAs underlies this LTD phenotype, hippocampal mGluR-dependent LTD is rendered insensitive to translational inhibitors in Fmr1 knockout mice (Hou et al., 2006Hou L. Antion M.D. Hu D. Spencer C.M. Paylor R. Klann E. Neuron. 2006; 51: 441-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, Nosyreva and Huber, 2006Nosyreva E.D. Huber K.M. J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 3291-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Presumably, essential LTD proteins are constitutively overexpressed in the absence of FMRP. What might be the consequence of this manifestation of “hyperplasticity” in the hippocampus? Recently it was shown that inhibitory avoidance learning in rats induces LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Whitlock et al., 2006Whitlock J.R. Heynen A.J. Shuler M.G. Bear M.F. Science. 2006; 313: 1093-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in LTD, mGluR-dependent protein synthesis has also been implicated in the reversal of LTP (Zho et al., 2002Zho W.M. You J.L. Huang C.C. Hsu K.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8838-8849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, one might anticipate that a manifestation of exaggerated LTD would be impaired retention or increased extinction of inhibitory avoidance memory. This phenotype has been observed in Fmr1 knockout mice (Dolen et al., 2007Dolen G. Osterweil E. Rao B.S. Smith G.B. Auerbach B.D. Chattarji S. Bear M.F. Neuron. 2007; 56: 955-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Thus, exaggerated mGluR-dependent protein synthesis in the absence of FMRP may yield specific patterns of cognitive impairment in adults with FXS. Cognitive impairment and autism may also reflect, at least in part, defects in synaptic development and/or developmental plasticity. Ocular dominance plasticity in the developing visual cortex, a commonly studied model for experience-dependent rearrangement and refinement of synaptic connectivity, requires both ERK activation and new protein synthesis, suggesting that similar translational mechanisms contribute to synaptic plasticity in the developing and adult brain (Maffei and Berardi, 2002Maffei L. Berardi N. Neuron. 2002; 34: 328-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, Taha and Stryker, 2002Taha S. Stryker M.P. Neuron. 2002; 34: 425-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies of ocular dominance plasticity in the fragile X mouse model again revealed hyperplasticity—an exaggerated response to visual deprivation (Dolen et al., 2007Dolen G. Osterweil E. Rao B.S. Smith G.B. Auerbach B.D. Chattarji S. Bear M.F. Neuron. 2007; 56: 955-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Neuronal activity-induced protein synthesis is crucial for long-lasting modifications of neural circuits. However, these findings in the mouse model of FXS suggest that impairments in synaptic and cognitive function can result from too much of what is normally a good thing. Further evidence that excessive translation can compromise cognitive function comes from mouse models deficient in PTEN and TSC1/2 function, in which elevated mTORC1 activity is associated with impaired hippocampal memory (Kwon et al., 2006Kwon C.H. Luikart B.W. Powell C.M. Zhou J. Matheny S.A. Zhang W. Li Y. Baker S.J. Parada L.F. Neuron. 2006; 50: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, Goorden et al., 2007Goorden S.M. van Woerden G.M. van der Weerd L. Cheadle J.P. Elgersma Y. Ann.

Med. 2008; 14: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). To facilitate consolidation of synaptic modifications, newly synthesized proteins must be targeted specifically to active synapses. The phenomenon of synaptic tagging and capture suggests that synaptic stimulation creates an immobile “tag” at active synapses that “captures” essential protein products (Frey and Morris, 1997Frey U. Morris R.G. Nature. 1997; 385: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Induction of L-LTP in one synaptic pathway can effectively convert E-LTP to L-LTP in a second independent synaptic pathway, suggesting that proteins synthesized in response to stimulation of one group of synapses are available to other stimulated synapses within the same neuron. Synaptic tagging and capture are also observed with LTD, and in fact, crosscapture has been reported between LTP and LTD: induction of L-LTP in one synaptic pathway can convert E-LTD to L-LTD in another pathway, and vice versa (Sajikumar and Frey, 2004Sajikumar S. Frey J.U. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2004; 82: 12-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Crosscapture suggests that induction of L-LTP and L-LTD may stimulate the synthesis of overlapping sets of proteins capable of enabling either process, consistent with evidence for the use of similar ERK- and mTOR-dependent translational mechanisms outlined above. In essence, synaptic capture implies that the local availability of essential proteins is sufficient to promote the consolidation of LTP and LTD. If the supply of essential proteins is limiting, competition can also be observed among groups of tagged synapses for consolidation of the accompanying synaptic changes (Fonseca et al., 2004Fonseca R. Nagerl U.V. Morris R.G. Bonhoeffer T. Neuron. 2004; 44: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). From a behavioral standpoint, new proteins synthesized during a learning episode enable associative and competitive interactions among neighboring synapses experiencing LTP and LTD, and the resulting pattern of persistent synaptic weight changes is likely to be crucial for proper long-term memory representation (Govindarajan et al., 2006Govindarajan A. Kelleher R.J. Tonegawa S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). By altering the levels and/or identities of available proteins, dysregulation of neuronal protein synthesis would interfere with the establishment of appropriate patterns of synaptic modification. In particular, increased availability of plasticity-related proteins would promote consolidation of synaptic changes that would otherwise be lost. Such inappropriate synaptic consolidation would generally be expected to compromise the cognitive performance of neural circuits, reducing the specificity and signal-to-noise ratio of synaptic changes that underlie normal learning. It is interesting to consider the possibility that excessive synaptic capture and consolidation may in certain situations allow for enhanced long-term memory formation. Superior declarative memory, which depends on the hippocampus, is a common feature of savant abilities in autistic individuals (Heaton and Wallace, 2004Heaton P. Wallace G.L. J. Child Psychol. Psychiatry. 2004; 45: 899-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whereas effective memory consolidation and retention typically benefit incrementally from repeated exposure to new information, individuals with savant abilities are remarkable in their capacity for rapid or “single trial” learning. Thus, in the case of mnemonic savant abilities, excessive protein synthesis could promote rapid and efficient synaptic capture and consolidation of hippocampal memory traces, regardless of their salience, while at the same time causing a more generalized impairment of cognitive function. In this way, cognitive impairment and savant abilities could be two sides of the same coin. It will be of interest to determine whether mutations causing elevated synthesis or abundance of neuronal proteins are associated with savant abilities in autism. The functions of gene products mutated in other monogenic disorders that overlap with autism lead us to speculate that overexpression of plasticity-related proteins may be one possible molecular mechanism underlying autism (Table 1). Neurofibromatosis type I is caused by inactivating mutations in neurofibromin (NF1), a Ras GAP, resulting in upregulation of Ras-dependent ERK and mTOR activation (Dasgupta and Gutmann, 2003Dasgupta B. Gutmann D.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3A have been identified in Angelman's syndrome, suggesting that ubiquitin-dependent protein turnover may be impaired in this disorder, possibly leading to elevated synaptic protein levels (Jiang and Beaudet, 2004Jiang Y.H. Beaudet A.L. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2004; 16: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Timothy's syndrome is caused by mutations in the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) Cav1.2, which impair channel inactivation and prolong inward calcium ion currents (Splawski et al., 2004Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Sharpe L.M. Decher N. Kumar P. Bloise R. Napolitano C. Schwartz P.J. Joseph R.M. Condouris K. et al.Cell. 2004; 119: 19-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Although the resulting enhancement of calcium ion influx may have pleiotropic effects, activation of the ERK pathway and CREB-dependent transcription are major effector mechanisms regulated by L-type VGCCs (Dolmetsch et al., 2001Dolmetsch R.E. Pajvani U. Fife K. Spotts J.M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2001; 294: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The molecular defects in these disorders suggest that a common consequence may be an overabundance of plasticity-related proteins. Rett's syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which can function as both a transcriptional activator and repressor (Chahrour et al., 2008Chahrour M. Jung S.Y. Shaw C. Zhou X. Wong S.T. Qin J. Zoghbi H.Y. Science. 2008; 320: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). In rare cases, a Rett-like syndrome can also be caused by duplication of the MECP2 locus, indicating that decreased and increased MeCP2 dosage produce similar phenotypes. Analysis of mouse models either lacking or overexpressing MeCP2 revealed that neuronal transcription of a large number of target genes is decreased by loss of MeCP2 function, whereas transcription of the same group of target genes is increased by gain of MeCP2 function. Interestingly, the number of excitatory hippocampal synapses is decreased in mice lacking MeCP2 and increased in mice overexpressing MeCP2 (Chao et al., 2007Chao H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 2007; 56: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), indicating that altered transcription of MeCP2 target genes, which presumably results in altered synthesis of the encoded proteins, produces corresponding changes in synaptic connectivity. As emphasized above for other autistic disorders, these findings suggest that cognitive deficits and autistic features arise in the MeCP2 duplication syndrome as a result of exaggerated protein expression. Conversely, findings from the mouse model of Rett's syndrome suggest that inadequate protein expression can also produce cognitive impairment and autism. Supporting this notion, multidisciplinary studies in mice have demonstrated that defects in synaptic protein synthesis impair hippocampal learning and memory (Kelleher et al., 2004aKelleher 3rd, R.J. Govindarajan A. Jung H.-Y. Kang H. Tonegawa S. Cell. 2004; 116: 467-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007Costa-Mattioli M. Gobert D.

In a recent human genetic study, ASD-linked deletion mutations affected several genes whose expression is stimulated by neuronal activity, further arguing that defects in synaptic activity-induced gene expression contribute to ASD pathogenesis (Morrow et al., 2008Morrow E.M. Yoo S.Y. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Lin Y. Hill R.S. Mukaddes N.M. Balkhy S. Gascon G. Hashmi A. et al.Science. 2008; 321: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we suggest that the performance of neuronal networks mediating cognition depends on the level of synaptic protein synthesis (Figure 2). Deviations in either direction from the optimal level of synaptic protein synthesis can adversely affect synaptic capture and consolidation, and the resulting perturbations in synaptic connectivity may underlie the development of cognitive impairment and autistic traits. The manner in which synaptic properties are affected by aberrant protein synthesis is likely to depend on the identities of the individual proteins whose expression is altered. A parsimonious view of autism pathogenesis would envision the convergence of diverse molecular triggers on a final common disease-causing pathway. The identification of ASD-linked mutations in the synaptic adhesion molecules neuroligins 3 and 4 has suggested that synaptic abnormalities play a central role in autism (Zoghbi, 2003Zoghbi H.Y. Science. 2003; 302: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, Persico and Bourgeron, 2006Persico A.M. Bourgeron T. Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 349-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Our proposed model provides an additional molecular mechanism leading to synaptic dysfunction in autism. How might defective synaptic adhesion and aberrant synaptic protein synthesis produce a common synaptic phenotype? Recent evidence indicates that neuroligins stabilize new synapses and specify their functional properties, thereby regulating the balance of excitatory and inhibitory transmission (Chubykin et al., 2007Chubykin A.A. Atasoy D. Etherton M.R. Brose N. Kavalali E.T. Gibson J.R. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 2007; 54: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) (see Essay by Walsh et al., page 396 of this issue). Interestingly, an ASD-linked missense mutation in neuroligin 3 shifts this balance of excitation and inhibition in favor of increased inhibitory drive (Tabuchi et al., 2007Tabuchi K. Blundell J. Etherton M.R. Hammer R.E. Liu X. Powell C.M. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2007; 318: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Dysregulated protein synthesis could similarly alter the balance of excitation and inhibition by promoting the net strengthening or weakening of excitatory relative to inhibitory synapses. For example, excessive protein synthesis-dependent LTD, as observed in the hippocampus of Fmr1 knockout mice, could promote a net weakening of excitatory relative to inhibitory synapses. Reduced excitatory and/or increased inhibitory synaptic activity has been observed in the hippocampus and neocortex of several other mouse models of ASDs, suggesting that an imbalance of excitation and inhibition may be a common synaptic phenotype underlying autism (Cline, 2005Cline H. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R203-R205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Dani et al., 2005Dani V.S. Chang Q. Maffei A. Turrigiano G.G. Jaenisch R. Nelson S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 12560-12565Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, Chao et al., 2007Chao H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 2007; 56: 58-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, Hanson and Madison, 2007Hanson J.E. Madison D.V. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4014-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether altered protein synthesis-dependent plasticity at excitatory and/or inhibitory synapses contributes to imbalances of excitation and inhibition in mouse models of autism. Single-gene disorders that increase autism risk in humans offer an exciting window into autism because they can be modeled in mice. Mouse models for several of these disorders display behavioral phenotypes resembling human autism, including impairments in cognition and social interaction (Moy et al., 2006Moy S.S. Nadler J.J. Magnuson T.R. Crawley J.N. Am. J. Med. Genet. C. Semin. Med. Genet. 2006; 142: 40-51Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, it should be emphasized that the synaptic pathology that yields autistic behavior in humans might have distinct effects in other species due to differences in brain circuitry. Thus, the failure of a single-gene mutation in mice to phenocopy the full spectrum of clinical features does not diminish the importance of the mouse models to reveal pathophysiology and, potentially, new treatments. Based on the findings in mice discussed above, we hypothesize that mutations that lead to excessive or dysregulated synaptic protein synthesis could be one mechanism contributing to autism in humans. One prediction of our hypothesis that can be tested in mice is that there should be some observable commonalities in the synaptic dysfunction wrought by the loss of FMRP, TSC1/2, and PTEN. If our hypothesis proves to be correct, approaches to restoring normal levels of protein expression may provide a therapeutic strategy for treating these disorders, and perhaps mental retardation and autism. In the case of FXS, the discovery of enhanced mGluR-dependent LTD suggests that inhibition of mGluR activity may be one way to limit the excessive translational response to mGluR activation (Bear et al., 2004Bear M.F. Huber K.M. Warren S.T. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 370-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Indeed, a range of phenotypes displayed by mice lacking Fmr1 can be rescued by genetic reduction of mGluR5 activity (Dolen et al., 2007Dolen G. Osterweil E. Rao B.S. Smith G.B. Auerbach B.D. Chattarji S. Bear M.F. Neuron. 2007; 56: 955-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin rescues abnormal hippocampal LTP and memory in a mouse model of TSC (Ehninger et al., 2008Ehninger D. Han S. Shilyansky C. Zhou Y. Li W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Ramesh V. Silva A.J. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Other approaches that restrain the activity of the molecular machinery regulating synaptic protein synthesis may have therapeutic potential in autism."

While RNase P protein moieties exhibit diversity not only in number but also in structural homology, RNase P RNAs from the different domains of life appear to have a similar core structure, suggesting their evolution from a common primordial RNA world progenitor. Twenty-five years ago, the RNA moiety of bacterial RNase P was shown to be the catalytic subunit of the enzyme, capable of catalyzing 5′ leader removal from tRNA precursors even in the absence of the protein subunit at elevated Mg2+ concentrations (Guerrier-Takada et al., 1983Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. The RNA moiety of ribonuclease P is the catalytic subunit of the enzyme.Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). More recently, RNase P RNAs from archaea and eukarya were found capable of mediating cleavage in the absence of protein, too (Kikovska et al., 2007Kikovska E. Svärd S.G. Kirsebom L.A. Eukaryotic RNase P RNA mediates cleavage in the absence of protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 2062-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Pannucci et al., 1999Pannucci J.A. Haas E.S. Hall T.A. Harris J.K. Brown J.W. RNase P RNAs from some Archaea are catalytically active.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 7803-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). RNase P is therefore not only generally considered to be a ribonucleoprotein, but tRNA 5′ end maturation in addition to ribosomal protein synthesis considered the only ribozyme-catalyzed cellular process universally persistent since the hypothetical prebiotic RNA world (Gesteland et al., 2006Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World: The Nature of Modern RNA Suggests a Prebiotic RNA World. Third Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.2006Google Scholar). Notwithstanding this general view, studies on RNase P activities from the organelles of some eukarya are at odds with a general ribonucleoprotein nature of the enzyme. Human mitochondrial and spinach chloroplast RNase P were both reported to have a protein-like density, to be insensitive to micrococcal nuclease treatment, and, if sufficiently purified, to be devoid of putative RNase P RNAs (Rossmanith and Karwan, 1998aRossmanith W.

Novel mechanisms for maturation of chloroplast transfer RNA precursors.EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); similar findings were reported for trypanosomal mitochondrial RNase P (Salavati et al., 2001Salavati R. Panigrahi A.K. Stuart K.D. Mitochondrial ribonuclease P activity of Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, because none of the protein components of one of these enzymes had been identified, all evidence remained essentially indirect, and so the idea of an RNA-free, protein-only RNase P has always been met with considerable skepticism (reviewed in Walker and Engelke, 2006Walker S.C. Engelke D.R. Ribonuclease P: the evolution of an ancient RNA enzyme.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To finally resolve the enigma of one of these controversial RNA-free RNase P enzymes we identified the components of human mitochondrial RNase P (mtRNase P), expressed the three identified proteins in E. coli, affinity-purified them to homogeneity, and reconstituted the enzymatic activity from the purified subunits. Thereby we demonstrate that in contrast to all hitherto characterized RNase P enzymes, human mtRNase P does not require a trans-acting RNA for catalysis but is composed of protein only. Initial attempts to purify human mtRNase P were reproducibly associated with a rapid loss of activity and accordingly poor recovery. In order to avoid this apparent obstacle for a conventional purification-to-homogeneity approach we designed a strategy based on partial purification only, using a minimal number of purification steps and requiring only moderate amounts of starting material. Outlined in brief, this strategy identifies the overlap proteome of different partially purified enzyme preparations by determining which proteins they have in common as a basis for the selection of candidate proteins. According to the underlying rationale, even if the composition of the individual preparations is still complex, the “partial purification overlap proteome” (PPOP) should contain only a limited number of proteins in addition to the components of mtRNase P, thereby making screening and verifying of candidates by reverse genetic methods a feasible task. Other combinatorial proteomics approaches have previously been successfully used to define awkward biochemical preparations, and the PPOP principle can be viewed as a reversal of the concept of subtractive proteomics (Andersen et al., 2003Andersen J.S. Wilkinson C.J. Mayor T. Mortensen P. Nigg E.A. Mann M.

Nuclear membrane proteins with potential disease links found by subtractive proteomics.Science. 2003; 301: 1380-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To avoid the potential confusion of mtRNase P activity with that of nuclear RNase P (nRNase P), a minor but persistent contaminant of mitochondrial preparations (Rossmanith and Potuschak, 2001Rossmanith W. Potuschak T. Difference between mitochondrial RNase P and nuclear RNase P.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8236-8237Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Rossmanith et al., 1995Rossmanith W. Tullo A. Potuschak T. Karwan R. Sbisà E. Human mitochondrial tRNA processing.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12885-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we used the precursor of mitochondrial tRNATyr ((mt)pre-tRNATyr) as a substrate for mtRNase P throughout all purification steps. Notably, (mt)pre-tRNATyr is not a substrate for nRNase P (Rossmanith et al., 1995Rossmanith W. Tullo A. Potuschak T. Karwan R. Sbisà E. Human mitochondrial tRNA processing.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12885-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from HeLa cells and purified by density gradient centrifugation and digitonin treatment. Cleared detergent lysates or sonicates were subjected to chromatography on anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, or chromatofocusing media (Figure 1A). Fractions containing mtRNase P activity were pooled and further purified by chromatography on heparin affinity matrix or by rate-zonal sedimentation in glycerol gradients. The five different two-step purification procedures (Figure 1A) increased the specific activity of the peak fraction of the second step between 5- and 30-fold (Figure 1B). In line with the rationale of our PPOP strategy the SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) patterns of the five preparations were basically dissimilar (Figure 1C). The proteome of each mtRNase P preparation was size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1C), gel slices subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion, and peptides identified by mass spectrometry. The entire proteome analysis of each preparation was independently performed on two different mass spectrometry platforms. Proteins identified by the two analyses were pooled, resulting in a total number of distinct proteins of between 166 and 362 per preparation (Figure 1D and Tables S1–S7 available online). Overall, in the five partially purified mtRNase P preparations, 884 distinct proteins were identified (Tables S7 and S8), none of which was a previously described RNase P protein or homologous to a previously described RNase P protein. From these five proteome sets, the PPOP was compiled: 24 of the 884 proteins were identified in all five preparations (Table 1), 29 in four, 81 in three, 164 in two of the five preparations, and 586 were unique to one of the sets (Tables S6–S9). All PPOP proteins were examined for their known or predicted biological function, biochemical pathway, catalytic role, and subcellular localization; information retrieved from various public databases was supplemented by domain/motif analyses and a prediction of mitochondrial targeting potential. Moreover, prospective mtRNase P candidate proteins were reasoned to score better in a ranking based on the number of peptides per protein in preparations with a more pronounced increase in relative specific activity (Figure 1; Tables 1 and S9); i.e., candidates were expected to have basically lower group numbers (better rank) in preparations based on, e.g., Mono P chromatofocusing than in the phenyl sepharose/heparin sepharose preparation. Assuming that mtRNase P might not have been sufficiently enriched in all five preparations to allow identification of its components, we extended the analysis to the proteins identified in four and three of five preparations (Tables S8 and S9).Table 1Partial Purification Overlap ProteomeProtein (Common Synonyms)aProteins identified in all five mtRNase P preparations.

The three proteins selected for further testing were RNA (guanine-9-)methyltransferase domain containing 1 (RG9MTD1; UniProt Q7L0Y3), the uncharacterized protein C17orf42 (Q96QE5), and the uncharacterized protein KIAA0391 (Q8N5L5), the latter not identified in the two preparations based on Mono Q chromatography (Tables S8 and S9). Assuming that mtRNase P is a multisubunit enzyme, we decided to test the selected candidate-protein subunits by tagged overexpression in human cells to enable them to assemble with endogenous components. A fraction of mtRNase P should thereby become tagged and amenable to affinity purification. cDNAs of the three proteins were cloned in frame with C-terminal affinity tags, and 293 cell lines capable of inducible transgene expression were generated. Mitochondria were prepared from expression-induced cells and extracts assayed for mtRNase P activity or subjected to affinity purification. Overexpression of RG9MTD1 resulted in an increase in mtRNase P activity in crude mitochondrial extracts when compared to cells overexpressing C17orf42 or to control cells (Figures 2A and 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2 in each panel). Moreover, upon affinity purification only RG9MTD1, but not C17orf42, was associated with mtRNase P activity (Figures 2A and 2B). Cloning of KIAA0391 lagged behind that of the other two cDNAs, and the generation of cell lines expressing KIAA0391 was stopped when the association of RG9MTD1 with mtRNase P was identified. A protein of approximately 26 kDa copurified with RG9MTD1 (Figure 2B, lanes 11 and 13). The apparent association was confirmed by overexpression of RG9MTD1 with a FLAG- instead of a 6× His-tag and subsequent anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation instead of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) (Figures 2C and 2D). Mass spectrometry revealed the 26 kDa protein to be hydroxysteroid (17-β) dehydrogenase 10 (HSD17B10), in the literature more frequently referred to as 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type 2 (HADH2). In fact HSD17B10 was a constituent of the PPOP (Table 1), but although its rank distribution in the five subproteomes was compatible with the relative specific activity of mtRNase P, we did not initially consider it as a mtRNase P protein candidate because of its attributed catalytic activities. However, in agreement with our data, an interaction of the Drosophila melanogaster homologs of RG9MTD1 and HSD17B10 was previously found in a two-hybrid screen of the fly proteome (Giot et al., 2003Giot L. Bader J.S. Brouwer C. Chaudhuri A. Kuang B. Li Y. Hao Y.L. Ooi C.E. Godwin B. Vitols E. et al.A protein interaction map of Drosophila melanogaster.Science. 2003; 302: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). Thus, since both proteins were consistently associated with mtRNase P activity, we termed them mitochondrial RNase P protein (MRPP) 1 (RG9MTD1) and MRPP2 (HSD17B10). Recombinant MRPP1 and MRPP2, expressed in E. coli, did not show mtRNase P activity, neither alone nor when assayed in combination (see also below). Yet, when both proteins were added to mitochondrial extract, mtRNase P activity was stimulated several-fold (Figure 3C, compare lanes 1 and 13), indicating that in vitro reconstitution of mtRNase P from bacterial-expressed recombinant MRPP1 and MRPP2 is possible, apparently requiring only one or more additional components. Size fractionation/reconstitution experiments suggested an additional protein component of approximately 60 kDa: mtRNase P activity could be reconstituted from recombinant MRPP1 and MRPP2 and protein(s) eluting from a gel slice of SDS-PAGE-fractionated mitochondrial extract in the 60 kDa range (Figure 3A); notably, no RNA was found in this 60 kDa fraction (data not shown). The high protein density in this molecular weight range, however, precluded direct protein identification by mass spectrometry, necessitating further purification/subfractionation. During affinity purification of MRPP1-tagged mtRNase P from human cells we observed an inverse correlation of mtRNase P activity and purity, but not quantity of MRPP1 and MRPP2: low-salt purifications were generally associated with good yields of activity but considerable impurities (data not shown), whereas high salt resulted in almost homogenous MRPP1 and MRPP2 but poor recovery of mtRNase P activity (Figure 2). Thus we reasoned that the missing component associates in a salt-labile manner with the two other proteins. Mitochondrial extract from 293 cells overexpressing His-tagged MRPP1 was applied to an IMAC column at low salt, and the column developed with 50 mM steps of NaCl to elute proteins associated with the MRPP1/MRPP2 complex, which itself remained bound to the matrix (Figure 3B). While salt-wash fractions did not exhibit mtRNase P activity on their own, mtRNase P could be reconstituted by the addition of recombinant MRPP1 and MRPP2 to the 150 mM salt-wash fraction (Figure 3C). This fraction was thus subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gel slices split and subjected to elution/reconstitution as well as mass spectrometry. From the slice capable of reconstituting mtRNase P activity 17 proteins were identified (Table S10), two of which were also present in the PPOP, and one, KIAA0391, that had already been considered a candidate but was not pursued any further after the identification of MRPP1. MRPP1, MRPP2, and KIAA0391 (designated hereafter as MRPP3) were expressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity by IMAC (Figure 4A). None of the three proteins alone, nor combinations of two of them, showed any pre-tRNA processing activity. However, a mixture of all three recombinant proteins reconstituted mtRNase P activity cleaving different (mt)pre-tRNAs in a manner identical to mitochondrial extract (Figures 4B and 4C). Cleavage sites of recombinant mtRNase P were mapped to the tRNAs' 5′ ends by high-resolution urea-PAGE (Figures 4D and 4E). Like native mtRNase P (Rossmanith et al., 1995Rossmanith W. Tullo A. Potuschak T. Karwan R. Sbisà E. Human mitochondrial tRNA processing.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12885-12891Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), recombinant mtRNase P generated tRNAs with 5′-phosphate ends (Figures 4F–4I) and required Mg2+ for catalysis (data not shown). Obviously, no RNA of human origin is required for the functional reconstitution of human mtRNase P; enzyme reconstitution from proteins produced in E. coli excludes other components of human origin but the proteins expressed. Yet, could minor contaminants from the expression host be involved in reconstituting mtRNase P? In particular, is an E. coli RNA involved in or responsible for catalysis? The fact that none of the three proteins alone showed any traceable mtRNase P activity appears to rule out any contamination of functional significance (Figures 4B and 4C). Still the possibility remained that a copurifying E. coli RNA acted in concert with all three proteins only. In fact, the purified proteins still contained low amounts of RNA (Figure 4K, lane 4; ∼10 ng per μg protein). However, treatment with micrococcal nuclease completely removed any RNA without sacrificing mtRNase P activity (Figures 4J and 4K). Moreover, deliberate addition of either M1 RNA, the RNA component of E. coli RNase P, or E. coli total RNA both inhibited instead of stimulated mtRNase P activity (Figures 4J and 4K). M1 RNA concentrations above 20 nM, and E. coli total RNA above 2.5 ng/μl, became increasingly inhibitory under standard assay conditions, yet concentrations below did not affect the enzymatic activity, i.e., neither inhibited nor stimulated (full range tested: 0.1–100 nM M1 RNA, 0.05–50 ng/μl E. coli total RNA; data not shown). And though the mechanism of inhibition is not known, the lack of stimulation confirms that no RNA from the expression host was involved in reconstituting mtRNase P activity from the three recombinant proteins. In summary, all data are incompatible with the involvement of any kind of trans-acting RNA, human or bacterial, inferring that human mtRNase P is composed of three proteins but no RNA. To substantiate the inferred physiological role of MRPP1, MRPP2, and MRPP3 in mitochondrial tRNA 5′ end maturation in vivo we subjected their expression to a transient knockdown by RNAi. The supposed deficiency in mtRNase P activity was reasoned to give rise to an increase in the cellular steady-state levels of (mt)pre-tRNAs. Two different siRNAs were used for each gene. All of them caused a decrease of the targeted mRNA (Figures 5A–5C) but no change in the steady-state levels of the other, nontargeted MRPP mRNAs (data not shown). With a delay of 2 to 6 days relative to the respective mRNA minima, (mt)pre-tRNAVal levels increased to temporarily peak at 6- to 60-fold above those of untreated cells (Figures 5D–5F); (mt)pre-tRNAIle accumulated concurrently, but its accumulation was less pronounced (Figures 5G–5I). Consistent with the transient nature of siRNA transfections, specific mRNA reduction and concomitant (mt)pre-tRNA accumulation reversed to normal within a few days. The variation of the relative mRNA and (mt)pre-tRNA levels of control siRNA-treated cells was less than 2-fold (Figure 5) and thereby within the fluctuation range of untreated cell samples (data not shown). Extent and kinetics of (mt)pre-tRNA accumulation are not directly related to the RNAi-induced mRNA reduction but depend also on the initial cellular concentration, the stability, and the resynthesis rate of the respective protein. It is thus not surprising that the degree of (mt)pre-tRNA accumulation varied between the three MRPP genes and was not a direct function of the maximally achieved mRNA reduction; e.g., (mt)pre-tRNAVal increased almost 30-fold after MRPP1 silencing but only 6-fold in the case of MRPP3, although mRNA reduction of the latter was even slightly more pronounced. Likewise, the offset between mRNA minimum and (mt)pre-tRNA maximum was specific for the target gene. Consistently, the two different siRNAs used to silence the expression of a particular gene gave rise to the same kinetics of (mt)pre-tRNA accumulation. For a given target gene the extent of (mt)pre-tRNA accumulation nevertheless depended on the knockdown capacity of the respective siRNA. This was most obvious in the case of MRPP2, where the much stronger and more persistent knockdown effect of siRNA #2 caused a more than 60-fold increase of (mt)pre-tRNAVal, while the less potent siRNA #1 elicited only a 6-fold increase (Figure 5E); in both cases (mt)pre-tRNAs nevertheless peaked at day 9 after transfection. Since we had no means to determine the levels of the three proteins directly, we scaled up and prepared and assayed mtRNase P activity from siRNA-treated cells. Reductions in mtRNase P activity should roughly correlate with the extent of (mt)pre-tRNA accumulation, if the latter is due to the RNAi-mediated loss of a genuine component of mtRNase P. A potent siRNA and a point in time between mRNA minimum and (mt)pre-tRNA maximum were selected for each gene, reasoning that the greatest loss of mtRNase P activity would be delayed to mRNA reduction but precede the peak of (mt)pre-tRNA accumulation. While control siRNA transfections did not alter mtRNase P activity, siRNAs targeting any of the three MRPP genes caused a reduction in mtRNase P activity (Figure 6). Consistent with the lower (mt)pre-tRNA accumulation potency of MRPP3 siRNAs, more mtRNase P activity remained after MRPP3 knockdown than after those of the other two mtRNase P genes. In conclusion, RNAi-mediated knockdown of any of the three MRPPs caused a transient mtRNase P deficiency with the concomitant accumulation of (mt)pre-tRNAs. Thus all three proteins that are required and sufficient to reconstitute an enzymatic activity capable of specifically cleaving (mt)pre-tRNAs at their 5′ end in vitro (without the need for any kind of trans-acting RNA) are also directly involved in (mt)pre-tRNA 5′ end maturation in vivo. Molecular identification of an RNase P devoid of RNA is without precedent so far. Since the first demonstration that the prototype E. coli enzyme contains an essential RNA moiety (Stark et al., 1978Stark B.C. Kole R. Bowman E.J. Altman S. Ribonuclease P: an enzyme with an essential RNA component.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 3717-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), every RNase P characterized in molecular detail had been found to contain a structurally related RNA, too. Moreover, the recent demonstration that eukaryal nRNase P RNA is capable of mediating pre-tRNA cleavage in the absence of protein like its bacterial or archaeal counterparts (Kikovska et al., 2007Kikovska E. Svärd S.G. Kirsebom"
https://openalex.org/W1966023562,"Bacteria can respond to adverse environmental conditions by drastically reducing or even ceasing metabolic activity. They must then determine that conditions have improved before exiting dormancy, and one indication of such a change is the growth of other bacteria in the local environment. Growing bacteria release muropeptide fragments of the cell wall into the extracellular milieu, and we report here that these muropeptides are potent germinants of dormant Bacillus subtilis spores. The ability of a muropeptide to act as a germinant is determined by the identity of a single amino acid. A well-conserved, eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr membrane kinase containing an extracellular domain capable of binding peptidoglycan is necessary for this response, and a small molecule that stimulates related eukaryotic kinases is sufficient to induce germination. Another small molecule, staurosporine, that inhibits related eukaryotic kinases blocks muropeptide-dependent germination. Thus, in contrast to traditional antimicrobials that inhibit metabolically active cells, staurosporine acts by blocking germination of dormant spores.

Thus, in contrast to traditional antimicrobials that inhibit metabolically active cells, staurosporine acts by blocking germination of dormant spores. Bacterial shape and cellular resistance to cytoplasmic turgor pressure are determined by peptidoglycan (PG), a polymer of repeated subunits of an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) peptide monomer that surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 1A). Covalent interactions between the stem peptides arising from separate chains typically crosslink the GlcNAc-MurNAc polymers, although in some organisms this crossbridge is composed of one or more amino acids. Most Gram-positive bacteria contain an l-lysine residue at the third position of the stem peptide (Figure 1B, left), whereas Gram-negative bacteria and most endospore formers have an m-Dpm (meso-diaminopimelic acid) residue in this position (Figure 1B, right). Peptidoglycan fragments serve as signals in a range of host-microbe interactions including B. pertussis infection and V. fischeri-squid symbiosis (Cloud-Hansen et al., 2006Cloud-Hansen K.A. Peterson S.B. Stabb E.V. Goldman W.E. McFall-Ngai M.J. Handelsman J. Breaching the great wall: peptidoglycan and microbial interactions.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). They also stimulate the innate immune response (Hasegawa et al., 2006Hasegawa M. Yang K. Hashimoto M. Park J.H. Kim Y.G. Fujimoto Y. Nunez G. Fukase K. Inohara N. Differential release and distribution of Nod1 and Nod2 immunostimulatory molecules among bacterial species and environments.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29054-29063Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) by binding to host proteins like Nod1 (Girardin et al., 2003Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Herve M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Peptidoglycan molecular requirements allowing detection by Nod1 and Nod2.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41702-41708Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Peptidoglycan fragments are generated by growing cells as peptidoglycan hydrolases and amidases partially digest the mature peptidoglycan to allow insertion of additional peptidoglycan monomers (Doyle et al., 1988Doyle R.J. Chaloupka J. Vinter V. Turnover of cell walls in microorganisms.Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 554-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While Gram-negative bacteria can efficiently recycle the resulting muropeptides, the lack of a similar recycling system in Gram-positive bacteria results in the release of large quantities of peptidoglycan fragments into the extracellular milieu by growing cells (Doyle et al., 1988Doyle R.J. Chaloupka J. Vinter V. Turnover of cell walls in microorganisms.Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 554-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Mauck et al., 1971Mauck J. Chan L. Glaser L. Turnover of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1820-1827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dormant bacteria must monitor nutrient availability so that they can reinitiate metabolism when conditions become favorable. This could be accomplished by determining changes in the levels of individual nutrients. Alternatively, the growth of other bacteria in the environment would also indicate the presence of favorable conditions. Since growing bacteria release muropeptides into the environment, these molecules could serve as an intercellular growth signal to dormant bacteria. Some Gram-positive species produce dormant spores under conditions of nutritional limitation. These cells are resistant to harsh environmental conditions and can survive in a dormant state for years (Nicholson et al., 2000Nicholson W.L. Munakata N. Horneck G. Melosh H.J. Setlow P. Resistance of Bacillus endospores to extreme terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 548-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). Spores exit from dormancy via the process of germination that is triggered by specific molecules known as germinants. Most spore-forming bacteria encode several germination receptors; for example, the B. subtilis GerAA/AB/AC proteins are necessary for germination in response to L-alanine. GerAA and GerAB are integral membrane proteins and GerAC is a putative lipoprotein. GerAA and GerAC, and GerBA, a GerAA homolog, are located in the inner membrane of the spore (Hudson et al., 2001Hudson K.D. Corfe B.M. Kemp E.H. Feavers I.M. Coote P.J. Moir A. Localization of GerAA and GerAC proteins in the Bacillus subtilis spore.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4317-4322Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Paidhungat and Setlow, 2001Paidhungat M. Setlow P. Localization of a germinant receptor protein (GerBA) to the inner membrane of Bacillus subtilis spores.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3982-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) where they are positioned to detect germinants that can pass through the outer layers of the spore. The precise chemical nature of germinants varies according to the species, and although they are typically nutrients, these molecules are not metabolized. The amino acid L-alanine or a mixture of asparagine, glucose, fructose, and potassium ions germinates B. subtilis spores, whereas L-proline germinates B. megaterium spores and purine ribonucleosides and amino acids act as co-germinants for B. anthracis spores (Setlow, 2003Setlow P. Spore germination.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). High concentrations of nutrient germinants would be consistent with the ability of the environment to support the growth of germinated spores. However, a more integrated determination of this ability is the growth of other microbes in the environment, and this growth would be indicated by the presence of released muropeptides. How might dormant spores recognize these muropeptides? One protein sequence hypothesized to bind peptidoglycan is the PASTA (“penicillin and Ser/Thr kinase associated”) repeat found in the extracellular domain of membrane-associated Ser/Thr kinases as well as in some proteins that catalyze the transpeptidation reaction in cell wall synthesis. The PASTA domain is a small (∼55 aa) globular fold consisting of 3 β sheets and an α helix, with a loop region of variable length between the first and second β strands (Yeats et al., 2002Yeats C. Finn R.D. Bateman A. The PASTA domain: a beta-lactam-binding domain.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). While the presence of PASTA domains in proteins that interact with peptidoglycan suggests that these domains may mediate this interaction, the binding of PASTA domains to peptidoglycan has not been demonstrated. The cytoplasmic kinase domain of M. tuberculosis PknB, the essential PASTA-domain-containing Ser/Thr kinase, is structurally homologous to eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinases (Young et al., 2003Young T.A. Delagoutte B. Endrizzi J.A. Falick A.M. Alber T. Structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis PknB supports a universal activation mechanism for Ser/Thr protein kinases.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Consistent with this homology, PknB phosphorylates several proteins, including a transcriptional activator (Sharma et al., 2006Sharma K. Gupta M. Krupa A. Srinivasan N. Singh Y. EmbR, a regulatory protein with ATPase activity, is a substrate of multiple serine/threonine kinases and phosphatase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2711-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and a cell division protein (Dasgupta et al., 2006Dasgupta A. Datta P. Kundu M. Basu J. The serine/threonine kinase PknB of Mycobacterium tuberculosis phosphorylates PBPA, a penicillin-binding protein required for cell division.Microbiology. 2006; 152: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The closely related B. subtilis PASTA-domain-containing Ser/Thr kinase, PrkC, phosphorylates elongation factor G (EF-G) both in vivo and in vitro. EF-G is an essential ribosomal GTPase involved in mRNA and tRNA translocation (Gaidenko et al., 2002Gaidenko T.A. Kim T.J. Price C.W. The PrpC serine-threonine phosphatase and PrkC kinase have opposing physiological roles in stationary-phase Bacillus subtilis cells.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and although the activity of its eukaryotic homolog, eEF-2 (Ryazanov et al., 1988Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G. Phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 by EF-2 kinase affects rate of translation.Nature. 1988; 334: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), is regulated by phosphorylation, similar data are not available for EF-G. While PrkC is not essential, ΔprkC strains have decreased viability (∼1 log) following incubation in stationary phase for >24 hr (Gaidenko et al., 2002Gaidenko T.A. Kim T.J. Price C.W. The PrpC serine-threonine phosphatase and PrkC kinase have opposing physiological roles in stationary-phase Bacillus subtilis cells.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and are moderately defective for sporulation (Madec et al., 2002Madec E. Laszkiewicz A. Iwanicki A. Obuchowski M. Seror S. Characterization of a membrane-linked Ser/Thr protein kinase in Bacillus subtilis, implicated in developmental processes.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 571-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Here we show that muropeptides, purified peptidoglycan or supernatants derived from cultures of growing cells, are potent germinants of dormant B. subtilis spores. Diverse bacteria can serve as the source of these molecules, but the identity of a single amino acid residue in the peptidoglycan stem peptide determines its ability to induce germination. PrkC is necessary for this germination response, and several small molecules known to affect the activity of related eukaryotic kinases either stimulate or inhibit germination. Dormant bacteria must continuously monitor conditions so that they can reinitiate metabolism when conditions become favorable. The growth of other bacteria in the local environment would reflect such changes, and this growth could be assayed by detecting released metabolic byproducts. These molecules would then serve as a signal for dormant cells that conditions conducive to growth are present. For example, dormant spores would be germinated by supernatants derived from growing bacterial cultures. We tested this possibility by growing B. subtilis and removing the cells from the supernatant by repeated filtration. Germination was assayed by measuring loss of heat resistance because dormant, but not germinated, spores are resistant to wet heat. Incubation of cell-free supernatants from B. subtilis cultures induced germination of dormant spores (Figure 2A, squares). This germination caused phase bright spores to become phase dark (Figure S1 available online) and occurred with similar kinetics as seen with nutrient germination (Figure S2). However, cell-free supernatants from the Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus did not induce germination, indicating that the stimulatory component was not generated by this species (Figure 2A, diamonds). Supernatants from E. coli cultures were also effective, albeit with decreased potency (Figure 2A, circles). The reduced effectiveness of E. coli supernatants likely results from the presence of the outer membrane that acts as a permeability barrier for hydrophilic compounds in the periplasm (Beveridge, 1999Beveridge T.J. Structures of gram-negative cell walls and their derived membrane vesicles.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore inhibits the release of molecules from the cell. However, the ability of cell-free supernatants derived from a Gram-positive and a Gram-negative species to induce germination suggests that the molecule(s) responsible are likely to be released by a phylogenetically broad range of bacteria. Finally, since supernatants isolated from cells transferred to non-growth medium failed to efficiently germinate spores (Figure S3), these molecules are likely to be produced only by growing cells. The increased spore germination induced by B. subtilis cell-free supernatant as compared to E. coli is consistent with the larger release of peptidoglycan fragments by Gram-positive as compared to Gram-negative bacteria (Goodell and Schwarz, 1985Goodell E.W. Schwarz U. Release of cell wall peptides into culture medium by exponentially growing Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 391-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, peptidoglycan fragments may act as a spore germinant. To examine this possibility, we purified peptidoglycan from growing B. subtilis cells and digested it into muropeptides with mutanolysin, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the β-1,4 bond between the MurNAc and GlcNAc sugars (red arrow, Figure 1A). Concentrations of peptidoglycan as low as ∼0.1 pg/ml induced germination (Figure 2B), indicating that spores detected one or more peptidoglycan fragments. This amount of peptidoglycan corresponds to <1 B. subtilis cell based on our isolation of ∼100 mg peptidoglycan from a 100 ml B. subtilis culture grown to an optical density (OD) of 1.2. B. subtilis peptidoglycan also germinated spores generated by other Bacilli including B. anthracis and B. megaterium (data not shown), indicating that the peptidoglycan germination signal is not genus specific. Bacterial peptidoglycan is often covalently associated with proteins and the anionic polymer teichoic acid. However, treatment of peptidoglycan with the proteases pronase and trypsin did not reduce its ability to act as a germinant (data not shown). In addition, peptidoglycan generated from a B. subtilis tagO mutant that is unable to synthesize teichoic acids (D'Elia et al., 2006D'Elia M.A. Millar K.E. Beveridge T.J. Brown E.D. Wall teichoic acid polymers are dispensable for cell viability in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8313-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) is similarly active as a germinant (data not shown). Thus, peptidoglycan fragments themselves are most likely to be the spore germinant. Further, peptidoglycan isolated from the spore cortex fails to efficiently function as a spore germinant (Figure S4), indicating that only peptidoglycan released by or isolated from vegetative cells functions as a germinant. The ability of both purified mutanolysin-digested peptidoglycan and cell-free supernatant to germinate spores suggested that muropeptides present in both preparations were responsible. To examine this possibility, we used high-performance liquid chromatography to separate mutanolysin-digested B. subtilis peptidoglycan into its muropeptide constituents. Incubation of disaccharide tripeptides with dormant B. subtilis spores at concentrations as low as 1 μM (Figure 2C) led to germination. In addition, disaccharide tetrapeptides were equivalently effective as germinants (data not shown). However, the concentrations of purified disaccharide tripeptides required for a germination response (μM) are higher than the concentration of muropeptides resulting from directly digesting peptidoglycan with mutanolysin (pM). One likely explanation for this difference is the substitution of muramic acid to muramitol due to a reduction step before HPLC purification. Further, both muramyl dipeptide (1 mM, data not shown) and an Ala-D-γ-Glu-Dpm tripeptide (500 μM, data not shown) failed to induce germination, suggesting that both the disaccharide and the third residue in the stem peptide play an important role. Thus, a disaccharide tripeptide appears to be the minimal chemical unit sufficient to germinate spores. Interestingly, a similar requirement is observed with a human peptidoglycan recognition protein heterodimer that binds tracheal cytotoxin where the disaccharide bridges the two proteins (Chang et al., 2006Chang C.I. Chelliah Y. Borek D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Deisenhofer J.

The ability of both supernatants derived from cultures of growing B. subtilis and E. coli, but not S. aureus, to induce germination (Figure 2A) could be the result of the presence of an m-Dpm residue in the third position of their stem peptides (Figure 1B, right). S. aureus, like most Gram-positive bacteria, has an L-Lys at that position (Schleifer and Kandler, 1972Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Peptidoglycan types of bacterial cell walls and their taxonomic implications.Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so the identity (m-Dpm versus L-Lys) of the third residue in the stem peptide could play an important role in recognition of peptidoglycan by spores. We examined this possibility by purifying peptidoglycan from a number of Gram-positive species that contain different amino acids at the third position of the stem peptide and assaying their ability to induce germination. Consistent with our prediction, only peptidoglycan containing m-Dpm at the third position acted as a germinant (Table 1). Peptidoglycan derived from the spore-former Bacillus sphaericus that, in contrast to all other Bacilli, contains an L-Lys at this position (Hungerer and Tipper, 1969Hungerer K.D. Tipper D.J. Cell wall polymers of Bacillus sphaericus 9602. I. Structure of the vegetative cell wall peptidoglycan.Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3577-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) did not induce germination, highlighting the importance of this residue. Both the mammalian Nod1 protein selectively binds peptidoglycan fragments containing m-Dpm (Girardin et al., 2003Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Herve M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41702-41708Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) and the human peptidoglycan recognition protein heterodimer binds tracheal cytotoxin where the m-Dpm residue is the primary specificity determinant (Chang et al., 2006Chang C.I. Chelliah Y. Borek D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Deisenhofer J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 8286-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the identity of the amino acid in the third position of the stem peptide is critical for the recognition of peptidoglycan by phylogenetically diverse proteins.Table 1Role of Third Residue of Stem Peptide in GerminationSpeciesPeptideGerminationBacillus subtilism-Dpm+ (85% ± 6)Bacillus anthracism-Dpm+ (65% ± 8)Bacillus megateriumm-Dpm+ (57% ± 4)Bacillus sphaericusL-Lys− (6% ± 5)Clostridium acetobutylicumm-Dpm+ (72% ± 8)Listeria monocytogenesm-Dpm+ (67% ± 3)Streptomyces coelicolorL,L-Dpm+ (77% ± 3)Enterococcus faecalisL-Lys− (10% ± 4)Staphylococcus aureusL-Lys− (5% ± 4)Streptococcus pyogenesL-Lys− (8% ± 6)Lactobacillus lactisL-Lys− (3% ± 2)Peptidoglycan isolated from different Gram-positive bacteria was incubated at concentrations of 100 mg/ml and 100 ng/ml with wild-type B. subtilis spores for 60 min. The presence of an L-Lys or an m-Dpm residue in the third position of the stem peptides is indicated: (+) >50% of the spores were heat sensitive in the presence of both concentrations of peptidoglycan; (−) no increase in heat sensitivity was observed in the presence of peptidoglycan. Open table in a new tab Peptidoglycan isolated from different Gram-positive bacteria was incubated at concentrations of 100 mg/ml and 100 ng/ml with wild-type B. subtilis spores for 60 min. The presence of an L-Lys or an m-Dpm residue in the third position of the stem peptides is indicated: (+) >50% of the spores were heat sensitive in the presence of both concentrations of peptidoglycan; (−) no increase in heat sensitivity was observed in the presence of peptidoglycan. Nutrient germinants are detected by germination receptors located in the spore membrane. Since peptidoglycan fragments still germinated spores lacking all five previously identified germination receptors (Paidhungat and Setlow, 2000Paidhungat M. Setlow P. Role of ger proteins in nutrient and nonnutrient triggering of spore germination in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2513-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), these receptors were not involved in this response (Figure S1). Therefore, to identify the relevant receptor for peptidoglycan fragments during germination, we examined bacterial membrane proteins known or hypothesized to bind peptidoglycan. Diverse bacteria, including all known spore-forming bacteria, have at least one eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr membrane kinase containing multiple PASTA repeats in their extracellular domains (Figure 3A); these repeats have been hypothesized to recognize the peptidoglycan stem peptide (Jones and Dyson, 2006Jones G. Dyson P. Evolution of transmembrane protein kinases implicated in coordinating remodeling of gram-positive peptidoglycan: inside versus outside.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7470-7476Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, Yeats et al., 2002Yeats C. Finn R.D. Bateman A. The PASTA domain: a beta-lactam-binding domain.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the B. subtilis member of this family, PrkCBs, is involved in peptidoglycan-dependent spore germination. Mutant spores lacking PrkCBs (ΔprkC) failed to germinate in the presence of peptidoglycan fragments or purified disaccharide tripeptides (Figure 3B) and tetra-peptides (data not shown). Thus, PrkCBs is required for the germination response of spores exposed to peptidoglycan. ΔprkC spores still responded to the nutrient germinant L-alanine (Figure 3B) and to the chemical germinant Ca2+-dipicolinic acid (Figure S5), indicating that the spores were still capable of germinating and that PrkCBs is not involved in nutrient or chemical germination. Since growing cells release peptidoglycan fragments into the extracellular milieu, germination by cell-free supernatant should also require PrkCBs. In support of this hypothesis, incubation of ΔprkCBs spores with cell-free supernatant derived from either B. subtilis or E. coli cultures (Figure 3C) did not result in germination. Although the identity of the component(s) in the supernatants necessary for germination is not known, the requirement for PrkCBs for germination in response to muropeptides suggests that these are likely to be the active molecules. Finally, we tested the requirement for PrkC in another spore former by constructing a deletion of the B. anthracis prkC homolog. Spores carrying this mutation were similarly blocked in the germination response to peptidoglycan (Figure S6). Thus, the role of PrkC in germination is conserved in at least two spore-forming bacterial species. During vegetative growth of B. subtilis, phosphorylation of EF-G, an essential ribosomal GTPase, is reduced in a strain lacking PrkC. In addition, purified kinase domain of PrkC phosphorylates EF-G in vitro on at least one threonine (Gaidenko et al., 2002Gaidenko T.A. Kim T.J. Price C.W. The PrpC serine-threonine phosphatase and PrkC kinase have opposing physiological roles in stationary-phase Bacillus subtilis cells.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6109-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether EF-G phosphorylation also occurs during PrkC-dependent germination. We generated lysates from wild-type and ΔprkC spores after incubation with cell-free supernatant for 60 min to stimulate germination and immunoprecipitated EF-G using polyclonal antibodies raised against E. coli EF-G (kind gift of W. Wintermeyer). When we probed these immunoprecipitated fractions with an anti-phosphothreonine antibody (Zymed), we observed that EF-G (as identified by probing the same fractions with the α-EF-G) phosphorylation increased following exposure to cell-free supernatant in wild-type spores (Figure 3D). In contrast, no change in phosphorylation was observed in spores lacking PrkC. As a confirmation of the kinase activity of PrkC during germination, we generated a FLAG-tagged point mutant (K40A) of PrkC since that residue was identified as necessary for PrkC phosphorylation (Madec et al., 2002Madec E. Laszkiewicz A. Iwanicki A. Obuchowski M. Seror S. Characterization of a membrane-linked Ser/Thr protein kinase in Bacillus subtilis, implicated in developmental processes.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 571-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Consistent with the expected effect of this mutation, this mutant PrkC did not support germination in response to PG (Figure S7) even though it was expressed and localized properly to the spore inner membrane (Figure S8), whereas a FLAG-tagged version of the wild-type protein did complement a ΔprkC mutation. Thus, PrkC appears to phosphorylate EF-G during germination,and this modification is likely necessary for germination in response to PG. The inability of ΔprkCBs spores to germinate in response to muropeptides suggested that PrkCBs is located either on the spore surface or in the spore interior. The presence of a hydrophobic stretch between the cytoplasmic kinase and extracellular PASTA domains as well as the association of PrkCBs with the cytoplasmic membrane in vegetative cells (Madec et al., 2002Madec E. Laszkiewicz A. Iwanicki A. Obuchowski M. Seror S. Characterization of a membrane-linked Ser/Thr protein kinase in Bacillus subtilis, implicated in developmental processes.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 571-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) suggest that PrkCBs is associated with the spore membrane, located below the spore coat (Figure 4A). To test the critical hypothesis that PrkCBs is membrane associated in the spore and therefore strategically positioned to sense extracellular peptidoglycan, we performed subcellular fractionation of spores expressing an epitope-tagged PrkC protein. Upon removal of the spore coat and outer membrane, we observed that a FLAG-PrkCBs fusion protein, which complements a ΔprkC mutation for peptidoglycan-dependent germination (Figure S7), was found in the inner membrane fraction of the spore (Figure 4B) similar to proteins involved in nutrient germination (Hudson et al., 2001Hudson K.D. Corfe B.M. Kemp E.H. Feavers I.M. Coote P.J. Moir A. Localization of GerAA and GerAC proteins in the Bacillus subtilis spore.J.

These decoated spores still responded to PG as a germinant (data not shown). Spores expressing either free GFP under control of a forespore-specific promoter or a fusion of GFP to a coat protein exhibited expected patterns of fractionation (Figure S8).

However, the mechanisms that couple plasticity stimuli to the trafficking of postsynaptic cargo are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that myosin Vb (MyoVb), a Ca2+-sensitive motor, conducts spine trafficking during long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength. Upon activation of NMDA receptors and corresponding Ca2+ influx, MyoVb associates with recycling endosomes (REs), triggering rapid spine recruitment of endosomes and local exocytosis in spines. Disruption of MyoVb or its interaction with the RE adaptor Rab11-FIP2 abolishes LTP-induced exocytosis from REs and prevents both AMPA receptor insertion and spine growth. Furthermore, induction of tight binding of MyoVb to actin using an acute chemical genetic strategy eradicates LTP in hippocampal slices. Thus, Ca2+-activated MyoVb captures and mobilizes REs for AMPA receptor insertion and spine growth, providing a mechanistic link between the induction and expression of postsynaptic plasticity.

Most models of learning and memory invoke modification of synaptic strength as the underlying mechanism for information storage in the brain. One compelling and intensely studied example is long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. LTP-inducing stimuli activate synaptic NMDA receptors, leading to increased synaptic AMPA receptors (Derkach et al., 2007Derkach V.A. Oh M.C. Guire E.S. Soderling T.R.

The coupling of AMPA receptor insertion and membrane addition to spines suggests the presence of a local intracellular source for these resources. Recent studies demonstrated that recycling endosomes (REs) located within or at the base of spines contain a pool of AMPA receptors to support local receptor cycling (Cooney et al., 2002Cooney J.R. Hurlburt J.L. Selig D.K. Harris K.M. Fiala J.C. Endosomal compartments serve multiple hippocampal dendritic spines from a widespread rather than a local store of recycling membrane.J.

During LTP, REs are rapidly mobilized into spines where their contents are delivered to the plasma membrane (Park et al., 2006Park M. Salgado J.M. Ostroff L. Helton T.D. Robinson C.G. Harris K.M.

Although RE trafficking is required for functional and structural changes at synapses during LTP, it is not understood how activation of synaptic NMDA receptors triggers the rapid spine mobilization of REs during LTP. The abundance of actin and the exclusion of microtubules from spines suggest that the trafficking of REs during LTP may involve actin-based myosin motors. The unconventional class V myosins have been widely implicated in vesicle and organelle trafficking (Desnos et al., 2007Desnos C. Huet S. Darchen F. ‘Should I stay or should I go?’: Myosin V function in organelle trafficking.Biol. Cell. 2007; 99: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Class V myosins consist of two heavy chains, each consisting of an N-terminal motor domain, a neck domain that binds calmodulin and other light chains, a coiled-coil region that mediates dimerization, and a C-terminal globular tail domain (GTD) that associates with cargo (Figure 1A). Of the three class V myosins (Va, Vb, and Vc), myosin Vb (MyoVb) has been shown to associate with REs and regulate the trafficking of a variety of receptors from REs to the plasma membrane in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells (Fan et al., 2004Fan G.H.

USA. 1996; 93: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), pointing to the possibility that MyoVb could mediate endosomal trafficking for LTP. Experiments utilizing acute inhibition of MyoVb have found that MyoVb tethers endosomes at the cell periphery for local recycling (Provance et al., 2004Provance Jr., D.W. Gourley C.R. Silan C.M.

Recent biochemical and structural studies indicate that the molecular structure of mammalian MyoVa, the prototypical class V myosin, is dynamically regulated by micromolar levels of Ca2+. At resting cellular Ca2+ levels, MyoVa exists in an inactive folded conformation characterized by a low actin-activated ATPase activity and inhibitory interactions between the N-terminal motor head and the C-terminal GTD. Micromolar Ca2+ concentrations lead to the unfolding or extension of MyoVa, a conformational switch that exposes the GTD (Krementsov et al., 2004Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M.

Extrapolated to MyoVb, such a conformation change would be predicted to expose the Rab11/Rab11-FIP2 binding domain, enabling association with REs and thereby engaging endosomal transport. Given the well-established requirement for elevated spine Ca2+ in LTP (Lynch et al., 1983Lynch G. Larson J. Kelso S. Barrionuevo G. Schottler F. Intracellular injections of EGTA block induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation.Nature. 1983; 305: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, Malenka et al., 1988Malenka R.C. Kauer J.A. Zucker R.S. Nicoll R.A. Postsynaptic calcium is sufficient for potentiation of hippocampal synaptic transmission.Science. 1988; 242: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), such studies point to the possibility that MyoVb acts as a Ca2+-sensitive trigger and actin motor for RE transport during LTP. In the present study, we demonstrate that MyoVb mediates Ca2+-dependent accumulation of REs and AMPA receptors in spines during synaptic potentiation. MyoVb is highly enriched in spines under basal conditions and is rapidly recruited to dendritic endosomes upon NMDA receptor activation via a Ca2+-dependent conformational switch that enables binding of MyoVb to the Rab11-FIP2 adaptor complex on REs. Disrupting or augmenting this interaction alternately impairs or enhances RE trafficking into spines. Furthermore, loss-of-function and dominant-negative experiments show that MyoVb is required for LTP-induced exocytosis from REs, AMPA receptor delivery, and new spine formation. Further, rapidly locking MyoVb on actin in single postsynaptic neurons by a chemical genetic inhibition strategy acutely abrogates LTP in hippocampal slices. Taken together, these results define MyoVb as a Ca2+ sensor for postsynaptic membrane trafficking during LTP and demonstrate a mechanistic link between synapse-specific signaling and actin-based transport that couples functional and structural plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. Moreover, these studies identify a novel physiological function for Ca2+-dependent activation of class V myosin in cells. Endogenous MyoVb in cultured hippocampal neurons was detected immunocytochemically using rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against rat MyoVb (Figure S1 available online). Synapses were labeled by PSD-95 immunostaining and REs were labeled by internalized Alexa-647 conjugated transferrin (Alexa-Tf) or mCherry-tagged transferrin receptor (TfR-mCh). In 19 day in vitro (DIV) hippocampal neurons, MyoVb was highly enriched in dendritic spines and localized near glutamatergic synapses labeled by PSD-95 (Figure 1B). Consistent with previous findings (Park et al., 2006Park M. Salgado J.M. Ostroff L. Helton T.D. Robinson C.G. Harris K.M. Ehlers M.D. Plasticity-induced growth of dendritic spines by exocytic trafficking from recycling endosomes.Neuron. 2006; 52: 817-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), REs were often positioned at the base of spines and occasionally within the heads of spines (Figure 1B). REs in spines colocalized with MyoVb, while those in dendritic shafts were rarely decorated with bright MyoVb puncta (Figure 1B). To gain more insight into the dynamics of MyoVb, the mobility of GFP-tagged MyoVb (GFP-MyoVb) and REs labeled with TfR-mCh were monitored in real time in individual dendritic spines. Consistent with the observed staining pattern for endogenous MyoVb, TfR-mCh labeled REs in spines colocalized with GFP-MyoVb clusters and both showed correlated movement into and out of spines (Figures 1C and 1E; Movies S1 and S2). This co-trafficking was selective for MyoVb, as REs did not show correlated movement with MyoVa (Figure S2). In contrast to full-length MyoVb, a truncated MyoVb lacking the cargo-binding GTD (GFP-MyoVb-ΔC) was highly localized to spines and exhibited local movement that was not correlated with REs (Figures 1D and 1E; Movie S3), suggesting that the GTD of MyoVb is important for RE trafficking in spines. REs move into spines in response to LTP-inducing stimuli (Park et al., 2006Park M. Salgado J.M. Ostroff L. Helton T.D. Robinson C.G. Harris K.M. Ehlers M.D. Plasticity-induced growth of dendritic spines by exocytic trafficking from recycling endosomes.Neuron. 2006; 52: 817-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We tested whether activation of synaptic NMDA receptors by glycine stimulation—a protocol used to induce synaptic potentiation in cultured hippocampal neurons (Lu et al., 2001Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Activation of synaptic NMDA receptors induces membrane insertion of new AMPA receptors and LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2001; 29: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar)—alters MyoVb trafficking. Under basal conditions, MyoVb concentrated in spines and rarely colocalized with REs in dendritic shafts. Upon brief glycine application (200 μM, 5 min), MyoVb showed increased overlap with REs at the base of spines (Figure 2A). Quantitative analysis revealed a significant increase in the amount of MyoVb associated with REs (normalized total MyoVb associated with TfR-GFP: unstimulated, 1.00 ± 0.05, n = 25 cells; glycine, 1.61 ± 0.22, n = 21 cells; p < 0.01, Student's t test; Figure 2B), while the total expression level of myosin Vb was unaltered (data not shown). Moreover, a similar stimulus-dependent increase in colocalization was found between MyoVb and REs labeled by endogenous TfR and internalized HA-GluR1 (Figure S3). To investigate the dynamics of NMDA receptor-triggered recruitment of MyoVb to REs, we performed live-cell imaging experiments on hippocampal neurons expressing TfR-mCh before, during, and after glycine-induced chemical LTP. Consistent with our immunostaining results (Figure 2A), REs at the base of spines showed little colocalization with GFP-MyoVb puncta under resting conditions (Figure 2C). However, after glycine stimulation, GFP-MyoVb rapidly localized to a population of TfR-positive REs at the base of spines and subsequently co-trafficked with dendritic REs into the spine head (Figures 2C and 2D; Movies S4 and S5). Quantitative analysis revealed a significant increase in the fractional amount of GFP-MyoVb associated with dendritic REs following glycine stimulation (Figure 2E). Furthermore, the stimulus-induced translocation of REs into spines was accompanied by a parallel increase in the average intensity of GFP-MyoVb in spines (Figure 2F). Blocking NMDA receptors with the antagonist APV (100 μM) prevented the translocation of MyoVb into spines following gly-LTP (Figure 2G). Removing extracellular Ca2+ prevented the stimulus-induced recruitment of GFP-MyoVb to REs (Figure 2H), consistent with a requirement for Ca2+ entry through activated NMDA receptors. Together, these data show that upon an LTP stimulus, MyoVb is recruited to REs that subsequently move into dendritic spines. Due to their high Ca2+ permeability, activation of NMDA receptor channels elevates Ca2+ in spines to micromolar levels or higher (Sabatini et al., 2002Sabatini B.L. Oertner T.G. Svoboda K.

Interestingly, the actin-activated ATPase activity and conformation of MyoVa, the prototypical class V myosin, are regulated by micromolar Ca2+ (Li et al., 2004Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M.

Given the structural similarity between MyoVb and MyoVa, we hypothesized that the conformation of MyoVb may also be regulated by Ca2+, allowing it to act as a Ca2+ sensor for stimulus-dependent association and spine transport of REs (Figure 3C). To test this hypothesis, we first measured the actin-activated ATPase activity of purified recombinant full-length MyoVb under Ca2+-free or high (100 μM) Ca2+ conditions. We found that high Ca2+ enhanced the ATPase activity of MyoVb nearly 10-fold (Figure 3A), similar to the Ca2+-dependent regulation of MyoVa. Second, we monitored the conformation of full-length MyoVb using analytical ultracentrifugation and sedimentation analysis. In the presence of Ca2+, MyoVb transitioned from a species with high sedimentation velocity (14.3S) to a species with lower sedimentation velocity (10.8S) (Figure 3B), consistent with a Ca2+-dependent switch from a compact to an elongated conformation. Next, we examined the binding of MyoVb to Rab11-FIP2. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) revealed that MyoVb forms a complex with Rab11 and Rab11-FIP2 in brain (Figure 3E). Similarly, when expressed in 293T cells, MyoVb coimmunoprecipitated with Rab11-FIP2 (Figure 3F). Notably, the binding between MyoVb and Rab11-FIP2 was enhanced with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ (Figures 3F and 3G; % of binding: 19.7 ± 5.4, 44.7 ± 17.1, and 86 ± 25 in 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mM free Ca2+, respectively; n = 6; p < 0.01, t test). We then sought to determine whether the Ca2+-dependent binding of MyoVb to Rab11-FIP2 was due to a conformational switch. We generated a mutant MyoVb with a shortened coiled-coil domain to disfavor the folded conformation and lock the motor into an extended open conformation (MyoVb-CCtr, Δ949–1042; Figures 3C and 3D) (Li et al., 2006Li X.D. Jung H.S. Mabuchi K. Craig R. Ikebe M. The globular tail domain of myosin Va functions as an inhibitor of the myosin Va motor.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21789-21798Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and tested its binding to Rab11-FIP2. Co-IP analysis showed that the MyoVb-CCtr mutant strongly bound to Rab11-FIP2 even under nominally Ca2+-free conditions (Figure 3H). As a negative control, a MyoVb mutant defective in Rab11/Rab11-FIP2 binding (MyoVb-ΔRBD, Δ1797–1811; Figures 3C and 3D) bound poorly to Rab11-FIP2 even at 1 mM Ca2+ (Figure 3H). These data provide strong evidence that Ca2+-dependent extension of MyoVb enables its association with cargo. In hippocampal neurons, Rab11-FIP2 exhibits a punctate distribution in dendrites, axons, and neuronal somas (Figure S4). In the soma and dendrites, Rab11-FIP2 localizes to TfR-positive REs (Figure S4). Intriguingly, whereas MyoVb-WT (wild-type) showed only partial overlap with Rab11-FIP2 and TfR-positive REs, the constitutively extended MyoVb-CCtr mutant strongly colocalized with Rab11-FIP2 and REs present in both spines and dendritic shafts under basal conditions (Figures 4A–4C). In contrast, the Rab11-FIP2 binding-deficient MyoVb-ΔRBD mutant was almost exclusively localized to spines and exhibited much less overlap with Rab11-FIP2 and TfR-positive REs (Figures 4A–4C). Quantitative analysis revealed inverse effects of the CCtr and ΔRBD mutations on the colocalization of MyoVb with endogenous Rab11-FIP2 (Figure 4B) and with TfR-positive REs (Figure 4D, normalized MyoVb associated with REs: WT, 1.00 ± 0.05, n = 22 cells; ΔRBD, 0.67 ± 0.04, n = 9 cells; CCtr, 1.63 ± 0.08, n = 17 cells; p < 0.001, t test). We next tested whether the physical association of MyoVb with Rab11-FIP2 is required for ongoing endosome movement in dendritic spines. In cells expressing MyoVb-WT, a plot of TfR-mCh fluorescence intensity over time in spines revealed a mixture of fluctuating and flat lines, representing mobile and stationary REs, respectively (Figure 4E). In contrast, in neurons expressing MyoVb-ΔRBD, the fluctuation of TfR-mCh intensity was dampened (Figure 4E), indicating that association with Rab11-FIP2 is required for ongoing RE transport in spines. On the other hand, in neurons expressing MyoVb-CCtr, the fluctuation of TfR-mCh intensity was more pronounced (Figure 4E), indicating that increasing the association of MyoVb with REs increases their shuttling into and out of spines. Introduction of the ΔRBD mutation into MyoVb-CCtr reversed the increased spine transport of REs (Figure 4E). Both ΔRBD and CCtr/ΔRBD mutants impaired the spine motility of REs (Figure 4E), consistent with the ability of MyoVb-ΔRBD to dimerize with MyoVb-WT (data not shown) and act in a dominant-negative manner, likely by impairing association with dimeric Rab11 and Rab11-FIP2 (Jagoe et al., 2006Jagoe W.N. Lindsay A.J. Read R.J. McCoy A.J. McCaffrey M.W. Khan A.R. Crystal structure of rab11 in complex with rab11 family interacting protein 2.Structure. 2006; 14: 1273-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Figures 4A–4B and S5). Quantification of the coefficient of variance (CV) of TfR-mCh intensity confirmed the reduced or augmented spine trafficking of REs in neurons expressing MyoVb-ΔRBD and MyoVb-CCtr, respectively (Figure 4F; TfR-mCh intensity CV in spines: WT, 0.20 ± 0.01, n = 167 spines from 4 cells; ΔRBD, 0.14 ± 0.01, n = 104 spines from 4 cells; CCtr, 0.33 ± 0.05, n = 105 spines from 4 cells; CCtr/ΔRBD, 0.13 ± 0.01, n = 87 spines from 3 cells; p < 0.01 relative to WT). To further examine the structural requirements for conformation-dependent RE transport by MyoVb, we mutated three conserved residues in the motor domain (D136) and the GTD (K1699, K1772) to alanine residues. These three charged residues are conserved in MyoVa (D136, K1706, K1779) (Figure S6), and ionic interactions between them contribute to the folded structure of MyoVa (Li et al., 2008Li X.D. Jung H.S. Wang Q. Ikebe R. Craig R. Ikebe M. The globular tail domain puts on the brake to stop the ATPase cycle of myosin Va.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1140-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Introduction of either D136A or K1699A/K1772A mutations increased the colocalization of MyoVb with REs under basal conditions (data not shown), and both mutants enhanced the mobility of REs in spines to the same extent as MyoVb-CCtr (Figure 4F; TfR-mCh intensity CV in spines: D136A, 0.34 ± 0.04, n = 30 spines from 3 cells; K1699/1772A, 0.35 ± 0.04, n = 40 spines from 4 cells; p < 0.001 relative to WT). Our results above identify a Ca2+-dependent conformational change in MyoVb that facilitates its interaction with REs via Rab11-FIP2. To test whether this Ca2+-dependent switch mediates LTP-induced mobilization of REs to spines, we performed live-cell imaging experiments on hippocampal neurons expressing TfR-mCh and GFP-MyoVb while simultaneously activating synaptic NMDA receptors with glycine. As before (Figure 2C), glycine stimulation induced an abrupt increase in GFP-MyoVb-WT associated with dendritic REs (Figures 5A and 5D; Movie S6) and a simultaneous increase in GFP-MyoVb-WT colocalized with endogenous Rab11-FIP2 in dendrites (Figures S3F and S3G). Immediately following glycine treatment, MyoVb-laden REs translocated into the spine head, resulting in a 4-fold increase in the intensity of TfR-mCh in spines (Figure 5G; 4.4 ± 1.1-fold increase, n = 22 spines from 3 cells). In contrast to MyoVb-WT, glycine stimulation failed to recruit spine-localized GFP-MyoVb-ΔRBD to REs (Figures 5B and 5E; Movie S7), which did not translocate into spines (Figures 5B and 5G; 1.0 ± 0.2-fold increase, n = 19 spines from 3 cells; p < 0.001 relative to WT, t test). Conversely, GFP-MyoVb-CCtr constitutively localized to REs (Figures 4C, 4D, and 5C) and trafficked into and out of spines both prior to and after glycine stimulation (Figures 5C and 5F; Movie S8). Interestingly, in these neurons, the accumulation of REs in spines was significantly increased following glycine"

Our results demonstrate that neurofibromin modulates ERK/synapsin I-dependent GABA release, which in turn modulates hippocampal LTP and learning. An Nf1 heterozygous null mutation, which results in enhanced ERK and synapsin I phosphorylation, increased GABA release in the hippocampus, and this was reversed by pharmacological downregulation of ERK signaling. Importantly, the learning deficits associated with the Nf1 mutation were rescued by a subthreshold dose of a GABAA antagonist. Accordingly, Cre deletions of Nf1 showed that only those deletions involving inhibitory neurons caused hippocampal inhibition, LTP, and learning abnormalities.

Previous studies had implicated ERK signaling in learning and long-term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic plasticity mechanism thought to underlie learning and memory. This signaling pathway is activated during both LTP induction and learning, and decreases in its activity result in both LTP and learning deficits (Atkins et al., 1998Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C.

The NF1 gene is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes, as well as in many other nonneural cell types (Lynch and Gutmann, 2002Lynch T.M. Gutmann D.H. Neurofibromatosis 1.Neurol. Clin. 2002; 20: 841-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In patients, mutations of the NF1 gene cause learning disabilities and other cognitive symptoms (North, 2000North K. Neurofibromatosis type 1.Am. J. Med.

Pediatr. 1996; 17: 229-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice heterozygous for a null mutation of the Nf1 gene (Nf1+/−) also have spatial learning problems (Silva et al., 1997Silva A.J. Frankland P.W. Marowitz Z. Friedman E. Lazlo G.

Pharmacological or genetic approaches that reverse the enhancement in ERK signaling in Nf1+/− mice also reverse their LTP and spatial learning deficits (Costa et al., 2002Costa R.M. Federov N.B.

However, these studies did not reveal how the increases in Ras/ERK signaling observed in the Nf1+/− mice led to changes in inhibition and deficits in LTP and learning. Here, we demonstrate a role for ERK signaling in GABA release, LTP, and learning and show that disruption of this mechanism accounts for the learning deficits in an animal model of NF1. We show that the learning deficits of Nf1+/− mice are due to increases in ERK activation that lead to higher levels of synapsin I phosphorylation, greater GABA release, and consequently to LTP and learning deficits. To investigate the mechanism responsible for the learning deficits associated with the Nf1+/− mutation, we tested learning in mice with heterozygous Cre-mediated deletions of the Nf1 gene in key cell types in the brain. To generate lines with cell-type-specific Cre-mediated deletions, we crossed a mouse line with the Nf1 exons 31 and 32 flanked by lox P sites (Nf1floxed) (Zhu et al., 2001Zhu Y. Romero M.I. Ghosh P.

Identification of two distinct progenitor populations in the lateral ganglionic eminence: Implications for striatal and olfactory bulb neurogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the resulting mice included deletions of Nf1 in the following cell types: both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Nf1syn I; with synapsin I-Cre), forebrain GABAergic neurons (Nf1Dlx5/6; with Dlx5/6-cre), forebrain pyramidal neurons (Nf1αCaMKII; with αCaMKII-Cre), and most astrocytes (Nf1GFAP; with GFAP-Cre). To confirm the Cre-mediated deletions, we performed western blot analyses of neurofibromin levels in mice with homozygous Cre-mediated deletions. The results show that neurofibromin levels are reduced in the hippocampus (CA1 region) of the following mice with Cre-mediated homozygous deletions: Nf1syn I−/−, Nf1Dlx5/6−/−, and Nf1αCaMKII−/− (Figure S1 available online). In contrast, The Nf1GFAP−/− mice do not show significant neurofibromin deletion (Figure S1). However, detection of the Nf1 deletion in these mice was difficult because the Nf1 gene is expressed at low levels in astrocytes of adult mice (Zhu et al., 2001Zhu Y. Romero M.I. Ghosh P. Ye Z. Charnay P. Rushing E.J. Marth J.D. Parada L.F.

It is important to note that not all GFAP-Cre lines show astrocyte-specific deletion (Zhuo et al., 2001Zhuo L. Theis M. Alvarez-Maya I. Brenner M. Willecke K.

Astrocyte-specific inactivation of the neurofibromatosis 1 gene (NF1) is insufficient for astrocytoma formation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5100-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This could be because of the embryonic date when Cre is first expressed in these two lines (Hegedus et al., 2007Hegedus B. Dasgupta B. Shin J.E. Emnett R.J. Hart-Mahon E.K. Elghazi L. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Gutmann D.H.

NF1 patients have visual-spatial cognitive deficits (Dilts et al., 1996Dilts C.V. Carey J.C. Kircher J.C. Hoffman R.O. Creel D. Ward K. Clark E. Leonard C.O. Children and adolescents with neurofibromatosis 1: A behavioral phenotype.J. Dev. Behav. Pediatr. 1996; 17: 229-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and previous studies showed that the Nf1+/− mice have deficits in spatial learning (Morris water maze) (Silva et al., 1997Silva A.J. Frankland P.W. Marowitz Z. Friedman E. Lazlo G. Cioffi D. Jacks T. Bourtchuladze R. A mouse model for the learning and memory deficits associated with neurofibromatosis type I.Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), a task known to be sensitive to hippocampal lesions (Morris et al., 1982Morris R.G.M. Garrud P. Rawlins J.N.P. O'Keefe J. Place navigation impaired in rats with hippocampal lesions.Nature. 1982; 297: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (4870) Google Scholar). Thus, the four lines of conditional mutants and controls were trained in the Morris water maze. As controls, we used each of the Cre lines, heterozygous Nf1floxed (Nf1floxed/+), and wild-type (WT) mice. No differences were observed between the four conditional mutant lines and their controls in performance on visible platform (Figure S2), floating (continuous immobility for more than 10 s during entire training), thigmotaxic behavior (swimming within 2 cm of pool wall; hug time during day 7 probe trial), or swimming speed during the day 7 probe trial (Table S1). Similarly, a comparison among all groups found no differences in the time mice took to find the platform during training (Figure S3). This is not surprising since this measure is known to be very insensitive to changes in spatial learning (Brandeis et al., 1989Brandeis R. Brandys Y. Yehuda S. The use of the Morris Water Maze in the study of memory and learning.Int. J. Neurosci. 1989; 48: 29-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). After 7 days of training, the mice were tested in a probe trial, a very sensitive measure of spatial learning (D'Hooge and De Deyn, 2001D'Hooge R. De Deyn P.P. Applications of the Morris water maze in the study of learning and memory.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2001; 36: 60-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, Lindner, 1997Lindner M.D. Reliability, distribution, and validity of age-related cognitive deficits in the Morris water maze.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1997; 68: 203-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The control lines (Table S2), as well as the Nf1αCaMKII+/− and the Nf1GFAP+/− mice, spent more time searching in the quadrant where the platform was during training (training quadrant) than in the other quadrants (Figure 1 and Figure S4). Surprisingly, even mice with an αCaMKII-Cre-mediated homozygous deletion of Nf1 (Nf1αCaMKII−/−) showed normal spatial learning (Figure S5). In contrast, Nf1syn I+/− and the Nf1Dlx5/6+/− mice did not spend more time in the training quadrant than in other quadrants (Figure 1 and Figure S4). Accordingly, these two conditional mutant lines spent less time in the training quadrant than did their controls (Table S3). These data demonstrate that heterozygous Nf1 deletions driven by either synapsin I-Cre or Dlx5/6-Cre result in spatial learning deficits. Both of these lines are known to express Cre recombinase in interneurons, an unexpected result suggesting a role for neurofibromin in inhibitory neurons. Although previous results suggested that GABA-mediated inhibition is altered in Nf1+/−mice (Costa et al., 2002Costa R.M. Federov N.B. Kogan J.H. Murphy G.G. Stern J. Ohno M. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Silva A.J. Mechanism for the learning deficits in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1.Nature. 2002; 415: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), the mechanisms were unknown. Therefore, we investigated next a possible role for neurofibromin in GABA-mediated inhibition. We examined both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons in Nf1+/− mice. We first recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in the present of kynurenic acid (1 mM) and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in the presence of kynurenic acid (1 mM) and tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM). The sIPSCs and mIPSCs recorded from Nf1+/− and WT mice showed no difference in amplitude, frequency, rise time, and decay time constant (Figures 2A and 2B and Table S4), suggesting normal GABA-mediated inhibition under baseline conditions. However, there is evidence that during learning inhibitory neurons fire at high frequency (Nitz and McNaughton, 2004Nitz D. McNaughton B. Differential modulation of CA1 and dentate gyrus interneurons during exploration of novel environments.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and it is possible that under these conditions inhibition is altered in the Nf1+/− mice. Additionally, studies in excitatory neurons indicated that phosphorylation of an ERK site in synapsin I modulates release in response to high-frequency stimulation (Chi et al., 2003Chi P. Greengard P. Ryan T.A. Synaptic vesicle mobilization is regulated by distinct synapsin I phosphorylation pathways at different frequencies.Neuron. 2003; 38: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and a similar mechanism may also regulate release in inhibitory neurons. Therefore, we compared the mIPSCs of Nf1+/− mice and controls after depolarization of synaptic terminals with high KCl (12.5 mM) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) in the presence of kynurenic acid (1 mM) and TTX (1 μM) to mimic high frequency stimulation. These conditions did not change the relative mIPSC amplitude but resulted in a significant increase in mIPSC frequency in both WT and Nf1+/− mice (Figure 2E). Importantly, the ratio between mIPSC frequency recorded in 12.5 mM KCl versus that in control solution (2.5 mM KCl) was significantly larger in Nf1+/− mice than in their WT littermates (Figure 2C), suggesting that under periods of high-frequency stimulation neurofibromin regulates GABA release. It is important to note that both these electrophysiological results with Nf1+/− mice and our behavioral analysis of Cre-driven Nf1 deletions indicate a role for neurofibromin in GABAergic neurons. We also examined excitatory neurotransmission by recording miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which result from spontaneous glutamate release by CA3 neurons on to CA1 neurons. We observed no significant differences in the properties of mEPSCs between the Nf1+/− mice and controls recorded with 2.5 mM KCl (Table S1). Depolarization of synaptic terminals with high KCl (12.5 mM) in ACSF increased the frequency of mEPSC in both WT and Nf1+/− neurons, but the ratio of mIPSC frequency recorded in 12.5 mM KCl to that in control solution (2.5 mM KCl) was not significantly different between WT and Nf1+/− neurons (Figures 2D and 2F). Together with our behavioral analysis of Cre-driven deletion, this result indicates that heterozygous deletions of Nf1 in excitatory neurons do not alter either synaptic function or learning. The two Nf1 heterozygous conditional mutant lines that showed spatial learning deficits, Nf1syn I+/− and Nf1Dlx5/6+/−, also showed higher mIPSC frequencies (12.5 mM KCl). In contrast, the conditional lines that did not show behavioral deficits (Nf1GFAP+/− and Nf1αCaMKII+/−) also did not reveal changes in mIPSCs in either normal or 12.5 mM KCl ACSF (Figures 2G and 2H). These results demonstrate a critical role for neurofibromin (and by implication ERK signaling) in the regulation of GABA release from interneurons. Neurofibromin is a RasGAP that accelerates the conversion of Ras from an active (GTP bound) to an inactive (GDP bound) state (Xu et al., 1990Xu G.F. O'Connell P. Viskochil D. Cawthon R. Robertson M. Culver M. Dunn D. Stevens J. Gesteland R. White R. et al.The neurofibromatosis type 1 gene encodes a protein related to GAP.Cell. 1990; 62: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Indeed, the Nf1+/− mutation leads to elevated Ras-GTP and hyperactivation of Ras downstream effectors such as ERK in the brain (Guilding et al., 2007Guilding C. McNair K. Stone T.W. Morris B.J. Restored plasticity in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1 via inhibition of hyperactive ERK and CREB.Eur. J.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1961-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To test whether the increased GABA release we observed in Nf1+/− mice is caused by increased ERK signaling activity, we introduced MEK inhibitors U0126 and PD98095 to the perfusion ACSF bath solution to block the Ras-ERK signaling by inhibiting MEK, an ERK kinase. In ACSF with 12.5 mM KCl, introduction of U0126 reduced the frequency of mIPSCs in Nf1+/− mice to the levels of WTs (Figure 3A). However, U0126 did not appreciably affect the mIPSC frequencies of WT and Nf1+/− mice in 2.5 mM KCl ACSF. Similar results were also obtained with another MEK inhibitor, PD98095. Just as U0126, PD98095 did not affect the mIPSC frequencies of WT and Nf1+/− mice with 2.5 mM KCl ACSF, but it brought the frequency of mIPSCs in Nf1+/− mice to the levels of WTs measured in 12.5 mM KCl (Figure 3B). Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel role for ERK signaling in the regulation of GABA release. Previous findings indicated that ERK phosphorylation of synapsin I modulates glutamate release under high-frequency activation (Chi et al., 2003Chi P. Greengard P. Ryan T.A. Synaptic vesicle mobilization is regulated by distinct synapsin I phosphorylation pathways at different frequencies.Neuron. 2003; 38: 69-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and this could be also a mechanism for how neurofibromin regulates GABA release. Therefore, we characterized ERK activation and ERK-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin I in Nf1+/− mice. Immunohistochemistry studies in the CA1 region detected an increase in the number of ERK phosphorylation-positive inhibitory neurons in both mutants and controls 30 min after 1 day training protocol in the water maze (five trials). Also, we found that the number of ERK phosphorylation-positive inhibitory neurons was overall higher in Nf1+/− mutants than in controls (Figures 4E and 4F). However, because of the difficulties in quantitating immunocitochemistry data, we next carried out western analysis studies. We decided to use fear conditioning instead of water maze because this one-trial learning task is known to engage hippocampal function and result in the phosphorylation of both ERK and synapsin I (Atkins et al., 1998Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C. Petraitis J.J. Trzaskos J.M. Sweatt J.D. The MAPK cascade is required for mammalian associative learning.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, Kushner et al., 2005Kushner S.A. Elgersma Y. Murphy G.G. Jaarsma D. van Woerden G.M. Hojjati M.R. Cui Y. LeBoutillier J.C.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9721-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Unlike the water maze paradigms we used, where learning is distributed through multiple trials taking nearly an hour, in this task learning is concentrated on a single session lasting only 5 min. This allows for better synchronization of learning processes and therefore phosphorylation signals that are more robust and homogeneous. Hippocampal lysates were prepared from Nf1+/− and WT littermates after contextual fear conditioning training. To characterize ERK activation and ERK-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin I in Nf1+/− mutants, we trained mice with a paradigm known to trigger biochemical changes related to conditioning (Kushner et al., 2005Kushner S.A. Elgersma Y. Murphy G.G. Jaarsma D. van Woerden G.M. Hojjati M.R. Cui Y. LeBoutillier J.C. Marrone D.F.

This strong training paradigm is ideally suited to trigger robust biochemical changes in the hippocampus (Atkins et al., 1998Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C. Petraitis J.J. Trzaskos J.M. Sweatt J.D. The MAPK cascade is required for mammalian associative learning.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, Kushner et al., 2005Kushner S.A. Elgersma Y. Murphy G.G.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9721-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) but results in ceiling-level freezing responses that occlude conditioning differences between the genotypes (data not shown). However, consistent with their hippocampal deficits, Nf1+/− mice showed significant impairments in this task when ceiling performances are avoided; Nf1+/− mice and WT controls were given one trial per day for 5 days, and their freezing responses were measured for 30 s on each training day and 24 hr after the last training trial (Figure 4A). Contextual conditioning significantly increased phosphorylation of both ERK and synapsin I (at the ERK site) in WT and Nf1+/− mice. Importantly, the increase in ERK phosphorylation in Nf1+/− mice is higher than that in WT controls (Figures 4B and 4C and Figure S6). As a control, we also used a training procedure that does not trigger contextual learning (Fanselow, 1986Fanselow M.S. Associative vs topographical accounts of the immediate shock-freezing deficit in rats: Implication for the response selection rules governing species-specific defensive reactions.Learn. Motiv. 1986; 7: 16-39Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar); in this procedure, the foot shock is administered immediately after introduction of animals to the training context (immediate shock). This procedure did not cause an increase in ERK phosphorylation in either Nf1+/− or WT mice (data not shown), a result attesting to the learning specificity of ERK phosphorylation triggered with contextual conditioning (e.g., not caused by foot shock). Similarly, Nf1+/− mice showed higher synapsin I phosphorylation than did WT controls (ERK-dependent sites 4/5; Figures 4B and 4D and Figures S6A and S6C). In contrast, synapsin I phosphorylation at the αCaMKII-dependent site 3 was equivalent in WT and Nf1+/− mice (data not shown). This result indicates that neurofibromin modulates ERK phosphorylation of synapsin I 4/5 sites during learning. Importantly, the two Nf1 heterozygous conditional mutant lines that showed spatial learning deficits, Nf1syn I+/− and Nf1Dlx5/6+/−, showed higher ERK phosphorylation than WT controls (Figures 4B and 4C). Consistently, Nf1syn I+/− and Nf1Dlx5/6+/− also showed higher phosphorylation of ERK-dependent sites 4/5 of synapsin I (Figures 4B and 4D). These results demonstrate that neurofibromin regulates ERK signaling and synapsin I phosphorylation, specifically in inhibitory neurons, a result that provides a mechanistic explanation for neurofibromin's role in GABA release. Previous studies suggested that enhanced GABA-mediated inhibition in the Nf1+/− mice results in deficits in hippocampal LTP (Costa et al., 2002Costa R.M. Federov N.B. Kogan J.H. Murphy G.G. Stern J. Ohno M. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Silva A.J. Mechanism for the learning deficits in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1.Nature. 2002; 415: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether the Cre deletions that resulted in enhanced inhibition and learning deficits also caused deficits in LTP. Accordingly, we demonstrate that CA1 LTP triggered with a five-theta-burst tetanus was d"

Germline mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common genetic disorder characterized by complex tumors called neurofibromas. Genetic studies indicate that biallelic loss of Nf1 is required in the tumorigenic cell of origin in the embryonic Schwann cell lineage. However, in the physiologic state, Schwann cell loss of heterozygosity is not sufficient for neurofibroma formation and Nf1 haploinsufficiency in at least one additional nonneoplastic lineage is required for tumor progression. Here, we establish that Nf1 heterozygosity of bone marrow-derived cells in the tumor microenvironment is sufficient to allow neurofibroma progression in the context of Schwann cell Nf1 deficiency. Further, genetic or pharmacologic attenuation of c-kit signaling in Nf1+/− hematopoietic cells diminishes neurofibroma initiation and progression. Finally, these studies implicate mast cells as critical mediators of tumor initiation.

Mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common, pandemic human genetic disorder that affects approximately 250,000 patients in the US, Europe, and Japan alone. The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a 320 kilodalton protein that functions at least in part as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for p21ras (Viskochil et al., 1990Viskochil D. Buchberg A.M. Xu G.

The NF1 cDNA is highly conserved among vertebrate species, with considerable homology extending to yeast and Drosophila (Bollag and McCormick, 1991Bollag G. McCormick F.

Individuals with NF1 have a wide range of malignant and nonmalignant manifestations, including plexiform neurofibromas that collectively affect 25%–40% of NF1 patients and are a major source of lifelong morbidity and mortality. Neurofibromas form in association with peripheral nerves and are composed of Schwann cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, degranulating inflammatory mast cells, and pericytes/vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and contain large collagen deposits. Using an Nf1 conditional knockout mouse model, we have confirmed retrospective studies from human tumors and demonstrated that Nf1 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the Schwann cell lineage is necessary but not sufficient to elicit neurofibromas (Zhu et al., 2002Zhu Y. Ghosh P. Charnay P. Burns D.K. Parada L.F. Neurofibromas in NF1: Schwann cell origin and role of tumor environment.Science. 2002; 296: 920-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In addition, we have reported that tumor progression requires complex interactions between Schwann cells and Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/−) cell lineages in the tumor microenvironment (Zhu et al., 2002Zhu Y. Ghosh P. Charnay P. Burns D.K. Parada L.F. Neurofibromas in NF1: Schwann cell origin and role of tumor environment.Science. 2002; 296: 920-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Thus, in an Nf1 wild-type (WT) background, Nf1 deficiency (Nf1−/−) in Schwann cells is necessary but not sufficient to cause tumor formation. A hallmark of the tumor forming heterozygous mice is the appearance of mast cells in peripheral nerves well in advance of tumor development (Zhu et al., 2002Zhu Y. Ghosh P. Charnay P. Burns D.K. Parada L.F. Neurofibromas in NF1: Schwann cell origin and role of tumor environment.Science. 2002; 296: 920-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro experiments mixing conditioned media from Schwann cells and mast cells have demonstrated a hypersensitivity of Nf1 heterozygous mast cells to conditioned media from Nf1-deficient Schwann cells (Yang et al., 2003Yang F.C. Ingram D.A. Chen S. Li X. Clegg T.E. White H. Mead L. Atkinson S. Kapur R. Williams D.A. Clapp D.W. Neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cells secrete a potent migratory stimulus for Nf1 +/− mast cells.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1851-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together these preceding studies have provided the basis for a model that Nf1 heterozygous mast cell infiltration of preneoplastic peripheral nerves and association with Nf1-deficient Schwann cells is critical for tumor development. In the present study, we validate the role of NF1 heterozygous bone marrow-derived cells in plexiform neurofibroma formation. Further, on the basis that c-kit receptor activation controls the release of mast cells from the bone marrow, we use both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of this receptor to prevent or delay plexiform neurofibroma formation in Nf1 mice. These results establish that Nf1 haploinsufficiency of bone marrow-derived cells and in particular those dependent on activation of the c-kit receptor is required in the tumor microenvironment to allow neurofibroma progression. The data implicate mast cells as active participants in tumor formation and identify therapeutic targets for human phase 1-2 clinical trials. To test the hypothesis that heterozygosity of Nf1 in hematopoietic cells within the tumor microenvironment is responsible for the genetic haploinsufficiency required for neurofibroma formation, we transferred Nf1 heterozygous bone marrow into lethally irradiated mice harboring two Krox20-Cre transgene ablated Nf1 alleles in approximately 10% of Schwann cells (Krox20;Nf1flox/flox). Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice are functionally WT in all non Schwann cell lineages and no neurofibromas are observed. As a complementary experiment, WT bone marrow cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated mice containing a germline knockout allele of Nf1 and a floxed allele susceptible to recombination in the Schwann cell lineage as above (Krox20;Nf1flox/−). Krox20;Nf1flox/− mice uniformly develop plexiform neurofibromas as previously described (Zhu et al., 2002Zhu Y. Ghosh P. Charnay P. Burns D.K. Parada L.F. Neurofibromas in NF1: Schwann cell origin and role of tumor environment.Science. 2002; 296: 920-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). To identify donor cells and their progeny within the recipients, the Nf1+/− and WT donors were intercrossed with a transgenic mouse that expresses EGFP in all bone marrow cells (Okabe et al., 1997Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. ‘Green mice’ as a source of ubiquitous green cells.FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). The intercrossed Nf1+/− or WT bone marrow that also expresses EGFP was transplanted into recipients following ionizing radiation, and the development of plexiform neurofibromas and mortality associated with these tumors was monitored until one year of age. A schematic of the experimental design is outlined in Figure 1A. Representative histograms of bone marrow cells in stably reconstituted mice showing EGFP fluorescence is shown in Figure 1B. Six months after transplantation, the functional germline WT (Krox20;Nf1flox/flox) recipients engrafted with heterozygous Nf1+/− bone marrow began to exhibit motor paralysis, weight loss and only 15% of mice survived the entire experimental period (Figures 2A and 2B). This mortality rate largely mirrored that previously observed in the germline heterozygous Krox20;Nf1flox/− mice (Figure 2A). In contrast, approximately 90% of Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice reconstituted with WT bone marrow were alive and exhibited no clinical features of plexiform neurofibroma formation (Figure 2A). Critical validation of these data was provided by the converse experiment in which transplantation of WT bone marrow cells into germline Nf1 heterozygous, Krox20;Nf1flox/−, mice restored survival comparable to nontumorigenic Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice that contain intact bone marrow (Figure 2A). Necropsy of the brains and spinal cords of the morbid mice revealed that 21 of 22 Nf1+/− bone marrow transplant recipients had an increased thickness of the entire spinal cord as compared to the spinal cords of nonsymptomatic mice transplanted with WT bone marrow (Figure 2C). This abnormal morphology resembles the tumorigenic Krox20;Nf1flox/− mice. In addition, we observed multiple, discrete tumors arising from the dorsal root ganglia of Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice transplanted with Nf1+/− bone marrow and these tumors were particularly prevalent in the sciatic nerves (Figure 2C, panels 3 and 4). Volumetric analysis of the tumors revealed a 3- to 6-fold increase in volume compared to unaffected dorsal root ganglia in mice that did not develop tumors. The large size and anatomic location of the tumors infiltrating the sciatic nerve and lumbosacral plexus likely account for the observed behavioral abnormalities (Figure 2B and Table S1 available with this article online). In sum, these data indicate that presence of Nf1 heterozygous bone marrow in the context of Schwann cell loss of heterozygosity is sufficient to recapitulate the morbidity and peripheral nerve hyperplasia originally observed in Krox20;Nf1flox/− tumorigenic mice. Pathologic analysis confirmed the presence of plexiform neurofibromas in 21 of 22 Nf1 heterozygous bone marrow recipients (Figure 3A). The dorsal root ganglia from Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice transplanted with Nf1+/− bone marrow exhibit classic histological features of human plexiform neurofibromas including disruption of normal architecture; wavy Schwann cells and infiltrating cells with hyperchromatic nuclei (Figure 3A, panels 7 and 8); excess collagen deposition (Figure 3B, panels 2 and 3); angiogenesis (Figure 3C, yellow arrowheads); classic ultrastructural abnormalities (Figure S1) and Schwann cell-specific markers (Figure S2). In contrast, the nerves from either Krox20;Nf1flox/flox or Krox20;Nf1flox/− mice transplanted with WT marrow exhibited normal appearing evenly distributed nuclei throughout sections of the dorsal root ganglia and proximal peripheral nerves (Figure 3A, panels 1, 4–6, 9, and 10). These mice showed no evidence of collagen deposition (Figure 3B, panels1, 4, and 5), neovascularization, and retained normal ultrastructural morphology (Figure S1). As described above, neurofibromas are complex tumors comprising multiple cell types in which LOH is uniquely present in the Schwann cell lineage (Zhu et al., 2002Zhu Y. Ghosh P. Charnay P. Burns D.K.

Mast cell infiltration is characteristic of human and murine plexiform neurofibromas (Hirota et al., 1993Hirota S. Nomura S. Asada H. Ito A. Morii E. Kitamura Y. Possible involvement of c-kit Receptor and its ligand in increase of mast cells in neurofibroma tissues.Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1993; 117: 996-999PubMed Google Scholar, Zhu et al., 2002Zhu Y.

In our mouse model, we observe peripheral nerve infiltration by mast cells preceding tumor appearance. Accordingly, the Nf1+/− bone marrow of reconstituted Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice also exhibited extensive mast cell infiltration as evidenced by mast cell-specific stains (Figures 3C, panels 2 and 3, 3D, and S3). To further discern the identity of bone marrow-derived lineages in the tumor, fluorescence cytometry was utilized to identify hematopoietic cells (CD45.2+) in the neurofibromas of Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice transplanted with Nf1+/− bone marrow (Figure 3E). In 12 tumors examined, a range of 3%–7% of the cells were hematopoietic cells (CD45.2+; EGFP+). From this population, the majority of cells were identified as mast cells (CD117+; FcɛRI+;EGFP+, Figure 3E, panel 3). A small population of macrophages (Figure 3D, panel 4) and rare B lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte populations were also observed (Figure 3E, panels 4 and 5). Consistent with the histological sections, there were no comparable populations of hematopoietic cells observed in dorsal root ganglia from Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice transplanted with WT bone marrow (data not shown). Subsequent genotyping confirmed that hematopoietic but not endothelial or fibroblast populations harbored the Nf1 null allele (Figure 3F). These data confirm the appearance of bona fide plexiform neurofibromas in the reconstituted Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice including homing of the transplanted heterozygous mast cells to the sites of Nf1-deficient Schwann cells. Collectively, the bone marrow transplantation experiments into Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice demonstrate that in the context of disruption of Nf1 in the embryonic Schwann cell lineage, Nf1+/− bone marrow is sufficient for tumor progression. Furthermore, the converse experiment of transplanting WT bone marrow into tumor prone Krox20;Nf1flox/− mice demonstrates that in this mouse model, Nf1+/− bone marrow is required for tumor progression. The fact that the only Nf1+/− cells detected in the reconstituted plexiform neurofibromas were bone marrow-derived was consistent with our previous in vitro and in vivo observations implicating a mast cell haploinsufficiency requirement in tumor formation (Ingram et al., 2000Ingram D.A.

The c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) controls many aspects of mast cell development and function (Galli et al., 1993Galli S.J. Tsai M. Wershil B.K. The c-kit receptor, stem cell factor, and mast cells.Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 965-974PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported that c-kit activity governs migration, proliferation, and survival of Nf1+/− bone marrow-derived mast cells (Ingram et al., 2000Ingram D.A. Yang F.C. Travers J.B. Wenning M.J. Hiatt K. New S. Hood A. Shannon K. Williams D.A. Clapp D.W.

Neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cells secrete a potent migratory stimulus for Nf1 +/− mast cells.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1851-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore next tested whether genetic disruption of c-kit activity in Nf1+/− bone marrow cells transplanted into Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice would affect tumor progression. Nf1+/− mice were independently intercrossed with two hypomorphic strains of mice deficient in mast cell mobilization by virtue of point mutations in the c-kit receptor that reduce kinase activity 85% (W41/W41) or 95% (Wv/Wv), respectively. The bone marrow from either Nf1+/−;Wv/Wv or Nf1+/−;W41/W41 doubly mutant mice was transplanted into five and ten recipient Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice respectively that had been previously irradiated with a dosage of ionizing radiation that induces bone marrow failure and lethality in the absence of a donor graft (Haneline et al., 1999Haneline L.S. Gobbett T.A. Ramani R. Carreau M. Buchwald M. Yoder M.C. Clapp D.W. Loss of FancC function results in decreased hematopoietic stem cell repopulating ability.Blood. 1999; 94: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Morbidity of mice engrafted with Nf1+/−;W mutant marrow was significantly reduced as compared to Nf1flox/flox mice transplanted with Nf1+/− bone marrow (Figure 4A). Accordingly, in contrast to recipients of Nf1+/− bone marrow, the dorsal root ganglia and proximal peripheral nerves from the Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice transplanted with Nf1+/−;W mutant marrow do not exhibit gross evidence of tumors (Figures 4A–4C). Furthermore, they do not exhibit histological features of neurofibromas (Figure 4D) nor evidence of invading hematopoietic cells as measured by fluorescence cytometry (data not shown). Despite the fact that recipient mice are lethally irradiated prior to bone marrow transplant, it is well known that W mutant bone marrow can be competitively overcome by wild-type bone marrow in vivo. Because of the complexity of intercrossing multiple alleles and infertility of the Wv/Wv mice, it was not possible to intercross the EGFP allele onto the intercrossed Nf1+/−;W mutant line. Therefore to rule out the possibility of any residual wild-type (Nf1flox/flox) recipient bone marrow overcoming the donor Nf1+/−;W bone marrow, we verified the predominant presence of the donor heterozygous genotype in bone marrow derivatives of engrafted animals (Clapp et al., 1995Clapp D.W. Freie B. Lee W.H. Zhang Y.Y. Molecular evidence that in situ-transduced fetal liver hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells give rise to medullary hematopoiesis in adult rats.Blood. 1995; 86: 2113-2122PubMed Google Scholar, Jordan et al., 1990Jordan C.T. McKearn J.P. Lemischka I.R. Cellular and developmental properties of fetal hematopoietic stem cells.Cell. 1990; 61: 953-963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of bone marrow from five randomly selected Nf1flox/flox;Krox20-cre recipients demonstrated predominant (>85%–100%) presence of the Nf1+/− genotype indicating effective donor engraftment of heterozygous bone marrow (Figure S4A). In addition, DNA from forty individual granulocyte macrophage and mast cell progenitors from each recipient, which grow as individual colonies in semisolid medium, was examined for detection of the Nf1 knockout, WT and Cre/lox alleles (Figure S4B). Approximately 95% of all progenitors examined (193/200) contained the Nf1 knockout allele but not the Nf1flox/flox allele. Collectively, these molecular data demonstrate the effective engraftment of donor marrow and further refine the identity of the active component of the Nf1+/− marrow to a c-kit dependent cell type. The availability of pharmacologic agents that can inhibit c-kit receptor activity permitted us to next examine whether such agents could affect neurofibroma formation or persistence. Imatinib mesylate is a potent inhibitor of the c-kit, PDGFR, and c-abl tyrosine kinases. To assess the activity of imatinib mesylate and other potential pharmacologic agents on tumor burden we validated a noninvasive fluoridinated deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging protocol permitting identification and longitudinal observation of plexiform neurofibromas in Krox20;Nf1flox/− mice (see Experimental Procedures and Figures S5A–S5C). We next selected cohorts of 8- to 9-month-old Krox20;Nf1flox/− mice with confirmed PET positive uptake in the region of the sciatic nerve for oral treatment with either 200 mg/kg/day of imatinib mesylate or a placebo control (PBS). FDG-PET imaging studies followed to evaluate the evolution of the tumors. Representative FDG-PET axial slices of affected nerves from three mice imaged before and after treatment with imatinib mesylate or PBS for 3 weeks are shown in Figure 5A. As predicted, increased FDG uptake was seen in Krox20;Nf1flox/− animals lateral to the spine prior to treatment with either imatinib mesylate or PBS (Figure 5A, panels 1, 3, and 5). Strikingly, FDG uptake was qualitatively reduced in the Krox20;Nf1flox/− mice treated with imatinib mesylate (Figure 5A, panels 2–4) compared to the PBS controls (Figure 5A, panel 6). To carefully measure the FDG-PET intensity in all treated animals, a standardized region of interest (ROI) was utilized in each animal to extract quantitative FDG uptake values (mCi/ml tissue). Three dimensional ROIs in the shape of cylinders were utilized to encapsulate the areas lateral to the spinal column with the ROI cylinders and specific vertebrae landmarks (lumbar 1-sacral 1) were used in all cases to assure consistency. Representative results from one experimental animal, before and after treatment, are shown in panels 7 and 8 (Figure 5A). A summary of these results for the sciatic nerve region ROIs of one cohort of 12 experimental mice are plotted in Figure 5B. Overall, the mice treated with imatinib mesylate had a mean 50% reduction in FDG-PET uptake after treatment (p < 0.035). In contrast, the metabolic activity of the tumors in the cohort treated with PBS had a modest but not significant increase in the FDG uptake ratio comparable to the progressive uptake in FDG observed as a function of time in emerging plexiform neurofibromas in Krox20;Nf1flox/− mice. To determine whether a change in metabolic activity (FDG uptake) directly correlated with histological changes in the tumors, the imaged cohorts were sacrificed, the spinal cords were examined, and sections were prepared for histologic evaluation. At postmortem, we also compared the volumes of all dorsal root ganglia from an age equivalent cohort of Krox20;Nf1flox/flox mice. Consistent with the FDG-PET imaging studies, there was a clear decrease in dorsal root ganglia volume in the imatinib mesylate treated group as compared to the PBS treated group (Figure 5C). Histological evaluation of the dorsal root ganglia and proximal surrounding nerves in mice treated with either imatinib mesylate or PBS was also conducted. Nerves harvested from placebo treated mice showed a distinct disruption of the normal nerve architecture and an increase in cellularity compared to imatinib mesylate treated mice. This is illustrated in tissue sections showing the distal dorsal root and proximal nerve segments (Figure 5D, panels1–6 compared to 7–12). Further, there is a marked reduction in the number of mast cells in nerves dissected from mice treated with imatinib mesylate compared to PBS treated controls (Figure 5D, panels 3 and 4 versus 9 and 10, Figure 5E). This reduction in tumor size is also associated with both an increase in apoptotic cells within the tumor (Figures 5F and S6) and a decrease in proliferation (Figure 5G). Collectively, the PET, gross anatomic and histological data identify the potential for imatinib mesylate to reduce tumor volume in Krox20;Nf1flox/− mice. Plexiform neurofibromas primarily present in infants and young children with NF1 and are frequently characterized by rapid growth and invasion into adjacent organs often resulting in impairment of normal organ function. These tumors can be life threatening and present major clinical challenges as surgical treatment has limited effectiveness, and no alternative therapies are currently available. As the present murine studies were nearing conclusion, a three year-old child with classic stigmata of NF1 including a plexiform neurofibroma presented with progressive life threatening airway compression. The tumor was originally diagnosed at age 6 months when a slow progressively enlarging mass of the left floor of the mouth, tongue, neck, and mastoid bone with encasement of the carotid artery and jugular vein was biopsied and histologically confirmed to be a neurofibroma. The tumor was deemed unresectable given the vascular involvement and she was observed clinically with sequential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Over the next 2 years, the tumor progressed to cause upper airway compression (Figure 6) manifested by difficulty sleeping, poor appetite, and episodes of drooling. A sleep study showed frequent interruptions of sleep but no oxygen desaturations to less than 91%. Based on these findings, the attending physician placed the child on 350 mg/m2/dose of imatinib mesylate for a limited trial. The parents provided consent for the use of imatinib mesylate following discussion of the recent research results at our institutions, potential risks and benefits of imatinib mesylate, and acknowledgment that although imatinib mesylate was a widely used drug for leukemias and solid tumors, including uses in infants, there was no human data for imatinib mesylate in NF1 related tumors. MRI scans before and after three months of treatment revealed a remarkable approximately 70% reduction in tumor volume (Figures 6 and S7). Following treatment for six months with no observed side effects (NCI CTC version 3 toxicity scale, http://ctep.cancer.gov), MRI scans showed stabilization of her response (Figure S7) without further reduction and the patient came off treatment. Though reflecting the course of a single patient, this striking result is consistent with the preclinical studies in the murine model. Theories concerning the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of idiopathic cancer have undergone significant evolution in recent years. The original notions that cell autonomous events convey a single cell to overcome its normal regulation leading to development of malignant disease, and furthermore the identity of the cell type of tumor origin, are presently under concerted reinvestigation. It is increasingly clear that while a series of genetic and epigenetic events in a single cell commence the trajectory toward a malignant phenotype, most forms of cancer include a cooption of a permissive microenvironment that allows and even promotes the tumorigenic state (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20695) Google Scholar). Following this hypothesis, a resistant environment would essentially preclude the possibility of tumor formation. Among identified noncell autonomous contributors to a coopted permissive process of tumor formation are neoangiogenesis, participation of the local stroma, and inflammation, among other cell types (Bhowmick et al., 2004Bhowmick N.A. Chytil A. Plieth D. Gorska A.E. Dumont N. Shappell S. Washington M.K. Neilson E.G. Moses H.L.

Werb Z. Inflammation and cancer.Nature. 2002; 420: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (10085) Google Scholar). The understanding of the precise order of paracrine interactions, the relative importance, and the molecular basis of the nontumorigenic environment interaction, remains in infancy. In this context, the development of murine mouse models that might permit dissection of cell autonomous and noncell autonomous contributions to tumor development has gained considerable ascendance. Mouse tumor models clearly require rigorous scrutiny in that the significance of such experimental strategies can only be appreciated in the context of a clear and verifiable physiological relevance to the human status. Therefore, a cardinal principle in mouse modeling of human cancer requires that mutations of relevant molecular pathways be developed in the same tissues as the human"

Histone methylation occurs on arginine and lysine residues and is involved in the regulation of gene transcription. A dynamic control of these modifications is exerted by histone methyltransferases and the recently discovered histone demethylases. Here we show that the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α binds to specific recognition sites in the genes encoding the jumonji family histone demethylases JMJD1A and JMJD2B and induces their expression. Accordingly, hypoxic cells express elevated levels of JMJD1A and JMJD2B mRNA and protein. Furthermore, we find increased expression of JMJD1A and JMJD2B in renal cancer cells that have lost the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor protein VHL and therefore display a deregulated expression of hypoxia-inducible factor. Studies on ectopically expressed JMJD1A and JMJD2B indicate that both proteins retain their histone lysine demethylase activity in hypoxia and thereby might impact the hypoxic gene expression program.

Mono- (me1), di- (me2), or tri- (me3) methylation has been described for five lysines in histone H3 (Lys-4, Lys-9, Lys-27, Lys-36, and Lys-79) as well as for one lysine within histone H4 (Lys-20). In general, di- and trimethylation of histone H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 appear as hallmarks of active regions of chromatin, whereas the same modifications on H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20 are enriched in condensed, heterochromatic regions.

Physiol. 2006; 91: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HIF is an α/β-heterodimeric DNA binding complex that directs an extensive transcriptional response (24Elvidge G.P. Glenny L.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar), HIF-2α (33Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W.

As molecular oxygen is a limiting factor in this reaction, HIF-1α is not efficiently hydroxylated in hypoxic conditions and escapes degradation. In tumors associated with an inactivation of the VHL gene, e.g. in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC, reviewed in Ref. 43Kaelin W.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Accordingly, the expression of HIF and its target genes can serve as markers for an unfavorable prognosis in cancer patients (e.g. Refs. 55Birner P. Schindl M. Obermair A. Plank C. Breitenecker G.

Here we show that hypoxia and HIF induce transcription of the JMJD1A and JMJD2B genes leading to increased protein expression. In addition, we provide evidence that the demethylase activity of both enzymes is reduced but still present even in severe hypoxia, indicating that a HIF-mediated induction of their expression might provide a compensatory mechanism to maintain a dynamic regulation of H3K9 methylation under low oxygen stress. Cell Culture—Human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (obtained from Lonza) were maintained in REGM with supplements and growth factors (Lonza) according to the provider's instructions. HeLa and HEK293 cells were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing Glutamax. Human prostate cancer LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen). 786-0 cells stably transfected with pRcCMV vector or pRcCMV-HA-VHL (58Lisztwan J. Imbert G. Wirbelauer C. Gstaiger M. Krek W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1822-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin and the cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air (20% O2). For hypoxia treatment, cells were incubated in an atmosphere containing 1, 0.5, or 0.2% oxygen and 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a hypoxia work station (Ruskinn), for the indicated time periods. Cells were treated, as indicated, with 100 μm desferrioxamine mesylate (DFO; Sigma). Microarray Analysis—Low passage renal proximal tubule epithelial cell cultures were exposed to normoxia or 1% oxygen for 24 h and total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three independent biological replicates were performed. RNA was re-purified using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Analysis was performed with HG_U133A GeneChips (Affymetrix) as described previously (46Staller P. Sulitkova J. Lisztwan J. Moch H. Oakeley E.J. Krek W. Nature. 2003; 425: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through accession number GSE12792. siRNA Silencing—HeLa cells were transfected with oligonucleotides (Dharmacon) at a final concentration of 25-50 nm using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. siRNA probe sequences are described in the supplemental information. Cells were incubated for 32 h in normoxia and an additional 16 h in hypoxia before harvesting. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I. cDNA was synthesized with a Taq-Man Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR Green 2× PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI Prism 7300 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Melting temperature profiles of final products and gel electrophoresis of test PCR were used to ensure amplicon specificity. The relative fold change in expression of each mRNA was calculated using the ΔΔCt method relative to 18S rRNA or human large ribosomal protein (hRPLPO) mRNA. Specific primer sets were designed using the PrimerDesign software (Applied Biosystems). Sequence information is described under supplemental information. Plasmids—pCMV-HA-hJMJD2B was kindly provided by Jesper Christensen (Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, Copenhagen). The cDNA encoding hJMJD1A was amplified by PCR from a human KIAA clone (KIAA0742). The PCR product was inserted into the XhoI and SalI sites of the pENTR1A vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. To generate an expression vector, the entry clone was transferred into a Gateway-compatible pCMV-HA (hemagglutinin) vector. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create JMJD2B(H189G/E191Q) and JMJD1A(H1120G/D1122N). Both PCR products were verified by sequencing and transferred into a Gateway-compatible pCMV-HA expression vector. Primer sequences are described under supplemental information. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assays were performed as described in Bracken et al. (59Bracken A.P. Pasini D. Capra M. Prosperini E. Colli E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5323-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells, incubated for 6 h either in normoxia or hypoxia (0.5% oxygen), were fixed in 1% formaldehyde. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 m glycine. Cells were lysed in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.02% NaN3 supplemented with leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in a mixture of lysis buffer and Triton dilution buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.02% NaN3, 5% Triton X-100) supplemented with the inhibitors mentioned above and sonicated to shear the chromatin. Samples were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), sonicated herring sperm DNA (Sigma), and bovine serum albumin for 20 min at 4 °C. 30 μl were saved as input samples. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HIF-1α (Abcam, ab2185), anti-RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc899), and anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-805) was performed overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes bound to protein A beads were washed with mixed micelle buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5.2% sucrose, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS), buffer 500 (0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% NaN3), LiCl buffer (0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.02% NaN3), and TE buffer. Elution was performed in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 for 1 h at 65 °C and cross-links were reversed at 65 °C overnight. Samples were treated with RNase (Roche) for 1 h at 37 °C and Proteinase K (Sigma) for 2 h at 55 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform. DNA was precipitated by addition of ethanol, NaOAc, and glycogen overnight at -20 °C. Pelleted material was washed in 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in H2O. Analysis of the samples was performed by real time PCR as described above. Sequence information for primer sets is described under supplemental information. Luciferase Reporter Assays—All promoter fragments were cloned into the KpnI/HindIII sites of the pGL2 basic reporter vector (Promega). Fragments were PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA using the primers described under supplemental information. The QuikChange kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce point mutations into the hypoxia-response elements. Reporter assays were performed as previously described (46Staller P. Sulitkova J. Lisztwan J. Moch H. Oakeley E.J. Krek W. Nature. 2003; 425: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was determined in a Fluostar Optima microtiter plate reader (BMG Labtech). Immunoblot Analysis—For immunoblot analysis cells were lysed in TNN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Primary antibodies used were anti-HIF-1α (BD Bioscience 610959), anti-HIF-2α (Abcam ab12606), anti-JMJD1A (Abcam ab52002), anti-JMJD2B (Abcam ab27531; Novus 100-74605), anti-vinculin (Sigma V9131), and anti-β-actin (Chemicon MAB1501). Histones were isolated with urea buffer (1% SDS, 9 m urea, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 700 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. Primary antibodies were anti-H3K9me1 (Abcam ab9045), anti-H3K9me2 (Upstate 07-441), and anti-H3K9me3 (Upstate 07-523). Quantification of band intensities was performed in ImageGauge software (Fuji). Flow Cytometry—Demethylase activity of HA-JMJD1A and HA-JMJD2B was determined using a 4-color FACS-Calibur (BD Biosciences). HeLa cells were transfected using FuGENE (Roche) and immediately transferred into hypoxia for 24 h. Samples were fixed in 70% ethanol, permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100), blocked (10% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline), and stained with primary and secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A11029 and A21443) in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin. An anti-HA antibody (BioSite MMS-101R) was used to detect overexpressed proteins. Histone modifications were analyzed with antibodies described in the immunoblot protocol. A minimum of 10,000 events were analyzed using FlowJo software. To confirm staining specificity for H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed with and without preincubation of antibodies with H3 peptides containing methylated lysine residues, according to the procedure described by Chadwick et al. (60Chadwick B.P. Willard H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17450-17455Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, antibodies were incubated for 2 h at ambient temperature with a 50 m excess of peptides (Abcam) presenting H3K9me2 (ab1772) or H3K9me3 (ab1773), respectively. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells transfected with pCMV-HA-hJMJD1A or pCMV-HA-hJMJD2B using FuGENE (Roche) were immediately transferred into hypoxia and after 24 h fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline. Staining was performed as described in Ref. 14Yamane K. Toumazou C. Tsukada Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wong J. Zhang Y.

Images were obtained with Cool Snap cf camera (Photometrics) and processed with Metamorph software. Statistical Analysis—If not otherwise indicated all values are presented as mean ± S.D. Student's paired t test was applied to reveal statistical significances. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Induction of JMJD1A and JMJD2B mRNA by Hypoxia—In an attempt to identify novel hypoxia-controlled genes in epithelial cells, we performed expression microarray analysis on human primary renal proximal epithelia cells that were treated with 1% oxygen for 24 h compared with cells cultured in normal atmospheric conditions. Among the group of 160 significantly up-regulated mRNAs in the hypoxia-treated population we found the transcripts of the JmjC proteins JMJD1A and JMJD2B (supplemental Table S1). A survey of published microarray studies revealed that besides these two (24Elvidge G.P. Glenny L. Appelhoff R.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Ragoussis J. Gleadle J.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2089689970,"The organization of the Escherichia coli chromosome into insulated macrodomains influences the segregation of sister chromatids and the mobility of chromosomal DNA. Here, we report that organization of the Terminus region (Ter) into a macrodomain relies on the presence of a 13 bp motif called matS repeated 23 times in the 800-kb-long domain. matS sites are the main targets in the E. coli chromosome of a newly identified protein designated MatP. MatP accumulates in the cell as a discrete focus that colocalizes with the Ter macrodomain. The effects of MatP inactivation reveal its role as main organizer of the Ter macrodomain: in the absence of MatP, DNA is less compacted, the mobility of markers is increased, and segregation of Ter macrodomain occurs early in the cell cycle. Our results indicate that a specific organizational system is required in the Terminus region for bacterial chromosome management during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1970972818,"Mitochondria dysfunction and hypoxic microenvironment are hallmarks of cancer cell biology. Recently, many studies have focused on isolation of brain cancer stem cells using CD133 expression. In this study, we investigated whether CD133 expression is regulated by bioenergetic stresses affecting mitochondrial functions in human glioma cells. First, we determined that hypoxia induced a reversible up-regulation of CD133 expression. Second, mitochondrial dysfunction through pharmacological inhibition of the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) produced an up-regulation of CD133 expression that was inversely correlated with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Third, generation of stable glioma cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA showed significant and stable increases in CD133 expression. These glioma cells, termed rho0 or ρ0, are characterized by an exaggerated, uncoupled glycolytic phenotype and by constitutive and stable up-regulation of CD133 through many cell passages. Moreover, these ρ0 cells display the ability to form “tumor spheroids” in serumless medium and are positive for CD133 and the neural progenitor cell marker, nestin. Under differentiating conditions, ρ0 cells expressed multi-lineage properties. Reversibility of CD133 expression was demonstrated by transfering parental mitochondria to ρ0 cells resulting in stable trans-mitochondrial “cybrid” clones. This study provides a novel mechanistic insight about the regulation of CD133 by environmental conditions (hypoxia) and mitochondrial dysfunction (genetic and chemical). Considering these new findings, the concept that CD133 is a marker of brain tumor stem cells may need to be revised."

We demonstrate that the culture growth factor environment and cell-cell interaction play a critical role in defining several unique and stable stem cell ground states. Following fertilization, the totipotent zygote undergoes rapid cleavage divisions to form a preimplantation blastocyst embryo, a hollow sphere in which two different cell types can be identified. An outer layer of trophectoderm cells encloses a small group of pluripotent cells known as the inner cell mass (ICM), from which the embryo proper will develop. At implantation, the ICM forms the extraembryonic endoderm and the epiblast, consisting of pluripotent cells that give rise to all embryonic germ layers. It was the pioneering work of Martin and Evans that demonstrated that cells in the ICM can be propagated indefinitely in vitro in a stable pluripotent state as embryonic stem (ES) cells, while maintaining the ability to generate all tissues of the adult body (Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J.

The recent derivation of epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) from postimplantation epiblasts provides a new perspective on the nature of human ES cells (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). At the molecular level EpiSCs are much more similar to human ES cells than mES cells. EpiSCs display a flattened two-dimensional (2D) colony morphology, which is also characteristic for human ES cells, and are maintained under similar growth factor conditions. The close match between EpiSCs and human ES cells suggests a functional similarity between these cells. EpiSCs display many characteristic hallmarks of pluripotent stem cells such as the expression of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog and the ability to generate derivatives of all three germ layers during both in vitro differentiation and in vivo teratoma formation. But interestingly, EpiSCs fail to contribute to chimera formation when injected into recipient blastocysts. The above comparisons of mES cells, human ES cells, and EpiSCs illustrate that stem cell pluripotency is not a fixed ground state but is strongly influenced by developmental and environmental context. Distinct pluripotent stem cell lines with unique functional characteristics can be derived from different parts of the embryo and under different growth factor conditions. For example, the functional differences in developmental potential between mES cells and EpiSCs may reflect the tissue of origin from which the stem cell line is initially derived, inner cell mass versus epiblast, or they may be a consequence of their different culture conditions. After all, mES cells require a combination of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) to maintain their undifferentiated state (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Nichols J.

To dissect the effect of the growth factor milieu and the developmental age of the tissue of origin on the stem cell pluripotent state, we derived novel stem cell lines from murine blastocyst embryos in culture conditions previously applied to derivation of EpiSCs from epiblast stage embryos. We designated these cells FAB-SCs for bFGF, Activin, and BIO-derived stem cells. We demonstrate that FAB-SCs are molecularly and functionally distinct from both ES cells and EpiSCs. FAB-SCs express common molecular markers of stem cell pluripotency, Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2, but unexpectedly, the cells fail to pass hallmark tests of pluripotent differentiation such as in vitro embryoid body formation, teratoma formation, or contribution to embryonic development upon blastocyst transplantation. However, brief (transient) stimulation of FAB-SCs with LIF and BMP4 induces the potential to generate teratomas and give germline contribution in chimeric mice. Our study provides new insights into the role of growth factor environment in reprogramming of the stem cell pluripotent state and identifies an unexpected role for cell-cell adhesion in this process. To analyze the role of the developmental stage of the embryo on the developmental potential of embryo-derived stem cells, we explored whether novel cell lines could be derived from blastocysts under similar growth factor conditions as previously described for EpiSC- and human ES cell cultures (bFGF, ActivinA, and BIO). Initial experiments using matrigel as substrate were unsuccessful, but when instead blastocysts were hatched on MEFs in the presence of bFGF, ActivinA, and BIO and a blocking antibody against murine LIF, we were able to derive stable cell lines with novel properties, which we designated FAB-SCs, for bFGF, Activin, and BIO-derived stem cells. If the zona pellucida was left intact, only 10% of the blastocysts hatched and upon trypsinization and passaging of the ICM outgrowths, a third of the hatched blastocysts yielded stable cultures that were homogenous in appearance (n = 184). Removal of the zona pellucida prior to plating of the embryos improved the derivation frequency significantly, as 80% of the embryos demonstrated robust ICM outgrowth and upon passaging 30% of the original blastocysts yielded stable FAB-SC lines (n = 99). It is interesting to note that under FAB-SC conditions ICM expansion was noticeable within 2 days after plating. In contrast, when blastocysts are plated under mES cell conditions, ICM expansion is delayed and occurs several days later. The difference in ICM outgrowth is not due to differences in cell proliferation rates since FAB-SCs and mES cell proliferation rates are similar (not shown). Instead, the delay in ICM outgrowth under ES cell conditions may indicate that ES cell lines are derived from a small subpopulation of cells within the ICM while FAB-SC conditions allow the entire ICM to expand. Alternatively, the delayed ICM outgrowth in ES cell conditions may reflect a pause in cell proliferation associated with epigenetic reprogramming events that are essential for the derivation of mES cells (Kaji et al., 2006Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). While speculative, this latter option would imply that such reprogramming does not occur under FAB-SC conditions. Unlike mES cell colonies, which have a characteristic three-dimensional appearance of tight shiny colonies, FAB-SCs grew as monolayer colonies reminiscent of EpiSCs (Figure 1A). Q-PCR analysis of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog demonstrated that all three pluripotency transcription factors were expressed in FAB-SC lines as well as in traditional mES cells (Figure 1B). We further confirmed the homogeneous expression and nuclear localization of these transcription factors using immunohistochemistry (Figure 1C). In addition, we confirmed the expression of the cell-surface marker SSEA1 on the FAB-SCs (not shown), further demonstrating that the FAB-SC cultures homogeneously express molecular hallmarks of pluripotent cells. Although FAB-SCs are derived on a feeder layer of MEFs, in the presence of a blocking antibody to LIF, we cannot formally exclude that very low residual levels of LIF signaling are required for FAB-SC derivation. However, established FAB-SC lines can be maintained on gelatin or Matrigel coated dishes in serum-free media in the absence of LIF or BMP4, with sustained expression of pluripotent markers, demonstrating that these growth factors are not required for the maintenance of these cells. Finally, as we will demonstrate below, stimulation of FAB-SCs with LIF and BMP4 induces profound permanent phenotypic changes in these cells, arguing that FAB-SCs do not experience these growth factors during their derivation. FAB-SCs are derived under culture conditions similar to those recently reported for the derivation of murine EpiSCs (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), but FAB-SCs and EpiSCs originate from different developmental stages of the embryo. To chart similarities and differences among FAB-SCs, ES cells, and EpiSCs, we performed global gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression analysis on these cells. Using a Luminex bead platform (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.MicroRNA expression profiles classify human cancers.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (7860) Google Scholar), we analyzed the expression levels of >430 miRNAs in independent ES, EpiSC, and FAB-SC clones. Heatmap analysis of these samples revealed clear differences in the global miRNA profiles of these three cell lines (Figure 1D). Interestingly, FAB-SCs express miRNAs recently shown to be ES cell specific, such as the miR-290 cluster (Houbaviy et al., 2003Houbaviy H.B. Murray M.F. Sharp P.A. Embryonic stem cell-specific MicroRNAs.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 351-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), or enriched in self-renewing ES cells, such as miR-18a, miR-19a, and miR- 20a (Hayashi et al., 2008Hayashi K. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Kaneda M. Tang F. Hajkova P. Lao K. O'Carroll D. Das P.P. Tarakhovsky A. Miska E.A. et al.MicroRNA biogenesis is required for mouse primordial germ cell development and spermatogenesis.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1738https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001738Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In contrast, EpiSCs express low levels of these miRNAs. These data demonstrate that FAB-SCs express miRNAs typical of ES cells, reflecting the blastocyst origin of these cells. EpiSCs, on the other hand, express several miRNAs associated with postimplantation development including miR-1 and miR-206 (associated with muscle development) and miR-150 and miR-142 (hematopoietic differentiation) (Chen et al., 2004Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs modulate hematopoietic lineage differentiation.Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar, Xiao et al., 2007Xiao C. Calado D.P. Galler G. Thai T.H. Patterson H.C. Wang J. Rajewsky N. Bender T.P. Rajewsky K. MiR-150 controls B cell differentiation by targeting the transcription factor c-Myb.Cell. 2007; 131: 146-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The microRNA expression profiling of these pluripotent stem cell lines underscores the unique character of FAB-SCs and reflects their early developmental origin. EpiSCs on the other hand demonstrate the expression of miRNAs associated with early lineage commitment, in line with the postimplantation epiblast origin of these cells. To further interrogate the similarities and differences between FAB-SCs, mES cells, and EpiSCs, we performed microarray analysis of the transcriptional profile of these different cell lines. FAB-SCs express several known pluripotency factors, including Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, at levels similar to those in mES and EpiSCs (Figure 1E). Yet, the expression of epiblast markers is absent or low in FAB-SCs compared to EpiSCs, demonstrating that while these cells are propagated under similar growth factor conditions, they are not the same (Figure 1E). FAB-SCs distinguish themselves from ES cells as well, as they do not express many of the genes associated with germ cell differentiation, such as Stella, Blimp1, or Dazl, which are commonly expressed in mES cells (Figure 1E). The mRNA expression analysis further demonstrates that FAB-SCs represent an alternative stable stem cell state that is distinct from both mES cells and EpiSCs. We next tested the ability of FAB-SCs to generate derivatives of all three germ layers in in vitro and in vivo assays of development. Embryoid body (EB) formation is a simple and widely used method in which aggregates of pluripotent cells initiate a differentiation program that is reminiscent of early embryonic development (Doetschman et al., 1985Doetschman T.C. Eistetter H. Katz M. Schmidt W. Kemler R. The in vitro development of blastocyst-derived embryonic stem cell lines: formation of visceral yolk sac, blood islands and myocardium.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 87: 27-45PubMed Google Scholar, Leahy et al., 1999Leahy A. Xiong J.W. Kuhnert F. Stuhlmann H. Use of developmental marker genes to define temporal and spatial patterns of differentiation during embryoid body formation.J. Exp. Zool. 1999; 284: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the context of the EB, molecular interactions that drive early embryonic development are recapitulated and cells differentiate to form ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm derivatives. Surprisingly, and in stark contrast to ES cells, EBs made from FAB-SCs remained small and failed to expand. We next interrogated the ability of FAB-SCs to form teratomas when injected into immunodeficient mice. FAB-SCs failed to form any teratomas at 3 months after injection (n = 20), whereas teratomas formed within 1 month in all mice injected with ES cells (n = 5). Pluripotency is characterized by the ability of a stem cell to self-renew indefinitely while maintaining the capacity to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers. While FAB-SC cultures display sustained expression of hallmark molecular markers of pluripotency >30 passages (Figure 1C), the cells fail to pass standard in vitro and in vivo tests of pluripotency such as EB differentiation or teratoma formation. As such, FAB-SCs are also molecularly and functionally distinct from primitive epiblast-like cells (EPL cells) that are derived when ES cells are cultured in the presence of HEPG2 conditioned medium (Rathjen et al., 1999Rathjen J. Lake J.A. Bettess M.D. Washington J.M. Chapman G. Rathjen P.D. Formation of a primitive ectoderm like cell population, EPL cells, from ES cells in response to biologically derived factors.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 601-612PubMed Google Scholar). Epiblast marker genes, which are expressed in EPL cells, are low or absent in FAB-SCs, and in contrast, FAB-SCs express the ICM marker Gbx2 and EPL cells do not. In addition, EPL cells are capable of forming teratomas, while FAB-SCs are not, excluding the possibility that FAB-SCs are EPL cells. To examine the influence of the growth factor milieu on FAB-SC pluripotency, we explored the effect of LIF and BMP4 stimulation on the ability of FAB-SCs to generate teratomas (Figure 2A). To ensure a homogeneous FAB-SC population, we used flow cytometry to sort single-cell clones of FAB-SCs containing a GFP transgene into 96-well plates and visually confirmed the presence of a single cell in each well. Clonal FAB-SCs were stimulated with LIF (100 ng/ml) and BMP4 (50 ng/ml) for 1 week and injected subcutaneously into NOD-SCID mice (1 × 106 cells, n = 7) to assess their teratoma-forming potential. While none of the native FAB-SC clones gave rise to teratomas, injection of LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SC clones resulted in the formation of teratomas in all recipients (3 independent clones, n = 7 for each clone). H&E staining and immunofluorescent detection of markers of germ layer differentiation demonstrated that the teratomas generated by the LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SCs displayed derivatives of all three embryonic germlayers (Figures 2B and 2C, left panels), demonstrating that brief culture in LIF/BMP4 induces FAB-SC developmental potential. Interestingly, when the LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SCs were returned back to the original FAB-SC growth factor conditions and cultured for another week, these “reverted” FAB-SCs retained the ability to generate teratomas (Figures 2B and 2C, right panels). Thus, the FAB-SC pluripotent state, induced by transient LIF/BMP4 stimulation, is retained even when the LIF/BMP4 stimulus is subsequently removed. To further explore our observation that LIF/BMP4 stimulation induced FAB-SC pluripotency, we examined the effect of growth factor stimulation on the ability of FAB-SCs to form chimeras upon transfer into recipient blastocysts. Control and LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SCs, expressing the GFP transgene described above, were injected into blastocyst embryos and their integration into the recipient blastocyst was monitored over time. While the LIF/BMP4-exposed FAB-SCs integrated with the cells of the ICM within 6 hr after injection, unstimulated FAB-SCs remained dispersed in the blastocyst cavity, revealing that integration of FAB-SCs into the recipient embryos was impaired (Figure 3A). To further analyze the developmental potential of FAB-SCs before and after growth factor stimulation, we transferred the embryos into pseudopregnant females and analyzed chimerism by the expression of the GFP transgene and/or coat color. No chimerism was observed in any of the >320 pups from blastocysts injected with 10–12 FAB-SCs each. Sectioning and immunohistochemistry staining of the embryos using an anti-GFP antibody revealed no GFP contribution to the recipient embryos at mid-gestation (E9.5–E11.5). In contrast, even brief 48 hr stimulation of FAB-SCs with LIF and BMP4 induced the ability of these cells to form chimeras. Although the chimeric frequency was low (7 out of 254 pups), the chimeras demonstrated high (40%–90%) FAB-SC contribution (Figure 3B, top panel). Mating with a wild-type female showed transmission of the FAB-SC-derived GFP transgene to the offspring, demonstrating that LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SCs are capable of germline contribution as well (Figure 3B, middle panel). These embryo chimerism experiments were repeated with single-cell-derived clonal FAB-SC lines. Again, no chimerism was observed upon blastocyst transfer of clonal FAB-SCs (n = 160). However, LIF/BMP4 stimulation of clonal FAB-SCs for 7 days induced the ability of these cells to contribute to recipient embryos with a frequency similar to the parental cell line (not shown). Finally, we analyzed whether FAB-SCs exposed to LIF/BMP4 for 1 week would contribute to chimera formation after further culture in bFGF, ActivinA, and BIO. Clonal LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SCs were cultured for an additional 7 days in FAB-SC media containing bFGF, ActivinA, BIO, and anti-LIF antibody and subsequently injected into recipient blastocyst embryos. GFP contribution by the injected reverted FAB-SCs was detected in 4 out of 123 embryos analyzed, with chimerism ranging from 20%–80% (Figure 3C), demonstrating that pluripotency is retained even after removal of the LIF/BMP4 signal. The above data demonstrate that LIF/BMP4 stimulation of FAB-SCs induces their ability to contribute to chimera formation. The relatively low number of chimeras obtained suggests that only a fraction of the FAB-SCs undergoes full growth-factor-mediated conversion to the pluripotent state. Robust contribution by cells that do successfully undergo pluripotent conversion, including contribution to the germline, indicates however that the induced cells are truly pluripotent. Importantly, the ability of FAB-SCs to display this effect at the clonal level demonstrates that the LIF/BMP4-stimulated chimera formation is the result of an induction of FAB-SC pluripotency rather than clonal selection of “competent” cells from a heterogeneous starter population. The unique properties of FAB-SCs allowed us to further probe the molecular mechanism behind the induction of FAB-SC pluripotency by growth factor stimulation. Microarray comparison of the FAB-SC gene expression profile of three independent clonal FAB-SC lines with the expression profile of LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SCs demonstrated profound changes in gene expression (Figure 4A, upper panel). Comparison of FAB-SCs to cells that were transiently stimulated with LIF/BMP4 and subsequently reverted to the original growth conditions of bFGF, ActivinA, and BIO enabled us to focus on gene expression changes linked to the induction of pluripotency (Figure 4A, lower panel). We compared the gene expression profiles of FAB-SCs, the LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SC, and the growth-factor-reversed FAB-SCs and searched for genes that were up- or downregulated at least 3-fold by LIF/BMP4 stimulation and remained altered in the reverted FAB-SCs. Only a handful of genes displayed this expression profile consistently in three independent FAB-SC clones (Figure 4B). Four “hits” were genes involved in RNA translation and two were genes with unknown function. Cdh1 (E-cadherin) displayed the most profound induction, as it demonstrated a 4- to 6-fold upregulation on all seven features of the microarray. Western analysis of E-cadherin expression in FAB-SCs, LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SCs, and reverted FAB-SCs demonstrated that while FAB-SCs express low levels of E-cadherin, LIF/BMP4 stimulation results in upregulation of E-cadherin expression to levels comparable to those observed in mES cells; this upregulation was sustained in the reverted FAB-SCs (Figure 4C). To further analyze the function of E-cadherin in pluripotent stem cells, we generated lentiviral shRNA hairpins to examine the effect of downregulation of E-cadherin expression on the ability of FAB-SCs to generate teratomas. shRNA hairpins were tested to functionally downregulate E-cadherin expression in mES cells (Figure S1A available online). While E-cadherin expression was unaffected in the control hairpin, two E-cadherin hairpins (Cdh1-SH3 and Cdh1-SH4) demonstrated >90% downregulation of E-cadherin expression and were selected for further experiments. Functional knockdown of E-cadherin expression was tested in a cell aggregation assay. Cadherins mediate cell-cell adhesion through homotypic interactions. Two cell populations expressing similar levels of the same cadherin will form homogeneous aggregates, while dissimilarities in the nature or level of cadherin expression will result in segregation of the two cell types (Gibralter and Turner, 1985Gibralter D. Turner D.C. Dual adhesion systems of chick myoblasts.Dev. Biol. 1985; 112: 292-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, Takeichi et al., 1981Takeichi M. Atsumi T. Yoshida C. Uno K. Okada T.S. Selective adhesion of embryonal carcinoma cells and differentiated cells by Ca2+-dependent sites.Dev. Biol. 1981; 87: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). While ES cells transduced with the control shRNA hairpin formed homogeneous aggregates when mixed with wild-type ES cells, ES cells expressing the E-cadherin hairpins did not mix with the wild-type cells but instead aggregated in spatially separate domains, demonstrating functional consequences of E-cadherin knockdown in these cell lines (Figure S1B). Next we explored the effect of knockdown of E-cadherin expression on LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SCs, but we were unable to establish stable clones using the E-cadherin knockdown hairpins. Transduction of LIF/BMP4-stimulated FAB-SCs with the control vector yielded stable clones expressing the tdTomato reporter gene present in the lentiviral shRNA vector (Figure 5A). Loss of E-cadherin has been reported to induce anoikis-mediated apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, yet no difference in apoptosis was observed between the control and E-cadherin knockdown samples (not shown). When we analyzed the transduced cells by fluorescent microscopy, however, we observed a striking difference in the morphology of the E-cadherin knockdown cells compared to control. In the control sample, tdTomato-positive (lentiviral-transduced) cells proliferated as undifferentiated colonies (Figure 5A, lower panels). In contrast, stimulated FAB-SC cells transduced with the E-cadherin hairpins had a fibroblast-like morphology, demonstrating that downregulation of E-cadherin resulted in rapid FAB-SC differentiation (Figure 5A"

A hallmark of these particles is a ring-shaped core domain generated by the binding of Sm proteins onto snRNA. PRMT5 and SMN complexes mediate the formation of the core domain in vivo. Here, we have elucidated the mechanism of this reaction by both biochemical and structural studies. We show that pICln, a component of the PRMT5 complex, induces the formation of an otherwise unstable higher-order Sm protein unit. In this state, the Sm proteins are kinetically trapped, preventing their association with snRNA. The SMN complex subsequently binds to these Sm protein units, dissociates pICln, and catalyzes ring closure on snRNA. Our data identify pICln as an assembly chaperone and the SMN complex as a catalyst of spliceosomal snRNP formation.

The mode of action of this combined chaperone/catalyst system is reminiscent of the mechanism employed by DNA clamp loaders. Molecular chaperones interact transiently with polypeptide chains, prevent or reverse misfolding, and thereby promote the adoption of functional tertiary structures. The concept of chaperone action also applies to the assembly of multisubunit macromolecular complexes. In this case, the primary function is to orchestrate the joining of individual components into a higher-order complex. In addition, these chaperones prevent nonspecific or premature interactions. Examples for this type of chaperones (also termed assembly chaperones) include the biogenesis factors of nucleosomes, proteasomes, or Rubisco (Hirano et al., 2006Hirano Y. Hayashi H. Iemura S.

SnRNPs are composed of a small eponymous snRNA, as well as common (Sm) and specific proteins. Prior to their involvement in the splicing cycle, snRNPs undergo a segmented biogenesis pathway, starting with the nuclear export of the snRNAs. Within the cytoplasm, the seven Sm proteins B-B′ (B′ is an alternatively spliced product of the Sm B gene), D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G bind to a single-stranded region of the RNA, termed Sm site. As a result, a toroidal Sm core domain is generated that interacts with the RNA in its central region (Kambach et al., 1999Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la Fortelle E. Raker V.A.

After additional modification and processing steps, the RNP is targeted to its nuclear site of function (reviewed in Will and Lührmann, 2001Will C.L. Lührmann R.

The formation of the Sm core domain has been recapitulated in vitro with purified Sm proteins and snRNA (Raker et al., 1996Raker V.A. Plessel G. Lührmann R.

These studies have established a hierarchical maturation pathway in which Sm proteins initially form the three hetero-oligomers D3/B, D1/D2, and E/F/G independent of snRNA. Next, binding of D1/D2 and E/F/G onto the snRNA leads to the formation of an Sm subcore intermediate, which is finally converted into the mature Sm core upon the addition of the D3/B heterodimer. Even though self-recognition of RNA and protein counterparts is sufficient for Sm core assembly in vitro, two functional units, termed PRMT5 and SMN complexes (protein arginine methyltransferase 5 and survival motor neuron complexes), are required in vivo (Meister et al., 2002Meister G.

The PRMT5 complex is composed of PRMT5, pICln, and WD45 (Mep50) and recruits Sm proteins via the pICln subunit (Friesen et al., 2001Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S.

PRMT5 symmetrically dimethylates arginines (sDMA) within the C-terminal tail domains of Sm proteins B-B′, D1, and D3, which is believed to enhance their transfer onto the SMN complex (Brahms et al., 2001Brahms H.

Although the factors that mediate Sm core formation have been identified, the mechanism of this reaction remains elusive. Here, we have dissected the assembly process by a combination of biochemical and structural studies. We identify a ring-shaped 6S particle composed of the Sm proteins D1/D2, E/F/G, and pICln, which does not allow RNA binding. SnRNP core formation depends on the activity of the SMN complex, which contacts the outer surface of this 6S intermediate and displaces pICln. As a consequence, the Sm proteins adopt an arrangement ready for snRNA binding and RNP formation. Our data identify pICln as an Sm-specific assembly chaperone and the SMN complex as a catalyst for the transfer of Sm proteins from the 6S complex onto snRNA. Previous studies have demonstrated a direct interaction between pICln and Sm proteins that occurs in Sm core formation before the SMN complex is involved (Friesen et al., 2001Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. The methylosome, a 20S complex containing JBP1 and pICln, produces dimethylarginine-modified Sm proteins.Mol. Cell.

Assisted RNP assembly: SMN and PRMT5 complexes cooperate in the formation of spliceosomal UsnRNPs.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5853-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To understand its role in the biogenesis pathway, we set out to identify complexes formed between pICln and Sm proteins in steady state. When cytosolic extract from HeLa cells was size fractionated by gel filtration, pICln eluted in two peaks that correspond to approximate sedimentation values of 20S and 6S, respectively (Figure 1A; see Supplemental Data available online for transformation of molecular weight into sedimentation values). The Sm protein D1 had an elution profile very similar to pICln, whereas PRMT5 and B-B′ were predominantly found in the 20S peak. Both peak fractions were individually subjected to immunoaffinity purification with anti-pICln antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, western blotting, and mass spectrometry. These approaches resolved the 20S peak as a complex formed by pICln, PRMT5, WD45, and all Sm proteins (Figures 1B, lanes 3 and 9, and 1C, lane 2). Of note, E/F/G in this peak was consistently underrepresented when compared to the other Sm proteins and, in many cases, could only be detected by mass spectrometric analyses (see also Figure S1). The 6S peak fraction, aside from pICln, contained the Sm proteins D1/D2 and E/F/G in apparently stoichiometric amounts while being devoid of D3/B (Figures 1B, lanes 4 and 10, and 1C, lane 3). Furthermore, immunoblots with the symmetrical dimethylarginine-specific Sm antibody Y12 revealed that not only the Sm proteins D1, D3, and B of the 20S complex were methylated, but also D1 in the 6S complex (Figures 1A, 1C, and data not shown). Thus, upon size fractionation, pICln resolves into two peaks, one containing only the Sm proteins of the snRNP subcore (6S) and one that is equivalent to the previously identified PRMT5 complex (20S). Isolated 6S complex contains equimolar quantities of D1, D2, E, F, G, and pICln (Figure 1B, lanes 4 and 10). However, the Sm protein units D1/D2 and E/F/G alone are incapable of forming a stable complex in the absence of snRNA (Raker et al., 1996Raker V.A. Plessel G. Lührmann R. The snRNP core assembly pathway: identification of stable core protein heteromeric complexes and an snRNP subcore particle in vitro.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined in detail how the five Sm proteins interact with pICln to form the 6S complex. For this, we incubated pICln with equimolar amounts of recombinant and unmethylated D1/D2, E/F/G, or a combination of both. Complex formation was monitored by gel filtration and subsequent SDS-PAGE. pICln formed a homogenous complex with D1/D2, as evident by the strict coelution of the three proteins in identical fractions from the column (Figure 2A). In contrast, in the presence of pICln, E/F/G eluted as a separate entity, indicating no or inefficient complex formation (Figure 2B; see also the chromatograms of individual components in the right panel). However, when pICln was incubated with a mixture of the Sm hetero-oligomers D1/D2 and E/F/G, a stable complex was formed (Figure 2C) with an identical elution profile to the 6S complex presented in Figure 1A. These findings are corroborated by immunoprecipitation of individual gel filtration fractions with anti-pICln antibodies (data not shown). Thus, the 6S complex forms in a stepwise manner, and the binding site for the E/F/G heterotrimer is generated by the preceding formation of a pICln/D1/D2 trimer. These data also suggest that methylation of Sm D1 appears to be dispensable for 6S formation. pICln formed a second stable unit with the unmethylated D3/B hetero-oligomer, i.e., the Sm proteins missing in the 6S complex (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the pICln/D3/B complex failed to interact with any of the other two Sm hetero-oligomers and, hence, is a separate unit (data not shown). This pICln complex is not detected at steady state in size-fractionated cytosolic extracts (see Figure 1A and data not shown) and, hence, is likely to be either short lived or to exist only as part of the 20S PRMT5 complex. The 6S complex (pICln/D1/D2/E/F/G) contains the five Sm proteins required for the assembly of the snRNP subcore, i.e., the intermediate formed in vitro on snRNA in the absence of the D3/B heterodimer (Raker et al., 1996Raker V.A. Plessel G. Lührmann R. The snRNP core assembly pathway: identification of stable core protein heteromeric complexes and an snRNP subcore particle in vitro.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This raised the question of whether the Sm proteins of the 6S complex were able to associate with snRNA. By native gel electrophoresis, we demonstrate that neither preformed 6S complex alone nor in conjunction with the pICln/D3/B heterotrimer forms RNPs on 32P-labeled U1snRNA (Figure 2E, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast and consistent with a previous report (Raker et al., 1996Raker V.A. Plessel G. Lührmann R. The snRNP core assembly pathway: identification of stable core protein heteromeric complexes and an snRNP subcore particle in vitro.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), spontaneous formation of the Sm subcore was observed upon incubation of D1/D2 and E/F/G with U1snRNA, which is matured into the snRNP core upon addition of D3/B (Figure 2E, lanes 2 and 3). No RNPs were formed on RNA lacking a functional Sm site either with pICln-bound or free Sm proteins (Figure 2E, lanes 6–10; see lanes 12–14, 16, and 17 for the protein complexes used). Therefore, Sm proteins appear to be incompetent to form snRNPs when they are associated with pICln. This could either mean that the 6S complex is a dead-end product in the assembly pathway or that it acts as a kinetic trap for the bound Sm proteins. If the latter scenario was correct, pICln would be a reversible inhibitor of snRNP core formation. This calls for another factor to liberate Sm proteins from the pICln-imposed inhibition and render them competent to form snRNPs. As the SMN complex is known to promote snRNP assembly in vivo (Massenet et al., 2002Massenet S. Pellizzoni L. Paushkin S. Mattaj I.W. Dreyfuss G.

Gemin proteins are required for efficient assembly of Sm-class ribonucleoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 17372-17377Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we speculated that it might relieve Sm proteins from the pICln-induced inhibition. We addressed this hypothesis by incubating preformed recombinant 6S and pICln/D3/B complexes with immobilized, affinity-purified SMN complexes (see Figure 3A for protein compositions of the complexes involved). After extensive washing, the retained proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. As shown in Figure 3B, Sm protein transfer occurred efficiently in both cases, as evident by an increase of the respective Sm protein levels on the SMN complex (Figure 3B, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8, and S2; note that Sm B comigrates with the light chain of the antibody). This reaction was strictly dependent on the SMN complex and could not be observed on a control column (Figures 3B, lanes 23 and 24, and S3, lanes 11 and 12). Furthermore, we found that the transfer reaction did not require prior methylation of Sm proteins, as these were obtained by bacterial expression. Next, we addressed whether the tail domains of Sm proteins, i.e., the sites of sDMA modification were required for SMN complex binding. For this, we performed the transfer reaction with a reconstituted pICln/D3/B complex in which the tail domains of both Sm proteins were absent (referred to as pICln/D3-Sm/B-Sm). The SMN complex efficiently accepted this truncated D3/B heterodimer, comparable to the Sm proteins of the 6S complex (Figure S3, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Having established that Sm proteins are transferred from pICln complexes to the SMN complex irrespective of their methylation status, we analyzed the fate of pICln in this reaction. By western blotting, pICln was shown to be absent from the recipient SMN complex, suggesting its dissociation from Sm proteins during transfer (Figures 3B, lanes 3 and 4, and S3, lanes 3 and 4, pICln immunoblot panel in the bottom of the figure). We next asked which subunits of the SMN complex participated in the Sm protein transfer reaction. As a prerequisite to address this question, we expressed two recombinant SMN complexes that lack Gemins 3, 4, and 5 (SMNΔGemin3–5) or Gemins 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (SMNΔGemin3–7) and purified them to near homogeneity (Figure 3A; see Supplemental Data for details). These units were immobilized onto an anti-SMN antibody resin, and transfer reactions were performed as described. Surprisingly, both units took over the Sm proteins in a manner indistinguishable from the endogenous complex, concurrent with the dissociation of pICln (Figure 3B, lanes 11, 12, 15, and 16). Hence, loading of the SMN complex with Sm proteins does not require Gemins 3–7. However, when the SMN complex was further reduced to a heterodimer composed of Gemin2 and an N-terminal fragment of SMN containing residues 1–160 (termed Gemin2/SMNΔC), the transfer reaction was stalled at an intermediate stage. Although Gemin2/SMNΔC still interacted with the 6S complex, the extent of pICln dissociation was reduced (see arrow in Figure 3B, lane 19 and pICln Immunoblot panel). In fact, this stalled transfer intermediate was stable and could be reconstituted with the recombinant proteins pICln, Gemin2/SMNΔC, D1/D2, and E/F/G (Figure S4, hereafter referred to as the 8S complex). Furthermore, transfer of the Sm proteins D3/B from pICln onto the Gemin2/SMNΔC heterodimer was severely impaired (Figure 3B, lane 20). Taken together, these experiments reveal that a heterotrimeric complex composed of SMN, Gemin2, and 8 is sufficient to accept all seven Sm proteins from pICln. However, the simultaneous removal of Gemin8 and the C-terminal part of SMN from this minimal system reduces the capacity to dissociate pICln from Sm proteins and recruit the Sm proteins D3/B. The findings above show that Sm proteins are incapable of associating with RNA while bound to pICln (Figure 2E). The activity of the SMN complex, in turn, leads to the displacement of pICln (Figure 3B). Hence, we considered that this activity is a major prerequisite for the subsequent formation of snRNPs. In a first approach, we analyzed the assembly of U1snRNP in the presence of endogenous SMN complex affinity purified from cytosolic extract. As this complex is active per se (Figure 4A, lane 4), a preincubation with a large molar excess of nonlabeled U1snRNA was performed to exhaust its inherent assembly activity (see Figure S5 for details). SMN complex treated this way failed to promote the formation of snRNPs on 32P-labeled U1snRNA (Figure 4A, lane 2). However, a simultaneous preincubation of the activity depleted SMN complex with 6S complex, and pICln/D3/B led to its reactivation and enabled assembly of the Sm core domain on U1snRNA (Figure 4A, lane 3). No RNPs were formed on U1snRNA lacking the Sm site (U1ΔSm) (Figure 4A, lanes 5–8). Next, the same reaction was performed with recombinant SMNΔGemin3–5 and SMNΔGemin3–7 complexes. As shown in Figures 4B and 4C, both failed to assemble U1snRNPs when Sm proteins were lacking (lanes 2). However, when loaded with 6S and pICln/D3/B or with 6S alone, they induced assembly of Sm cores and subcores, respectively (Figures 4B and 4C, lanes 3 and 4). No assembly was observed when the complexes were loaded with either pICln/D3/B alone (Figures 4B and 4C, lanes 5) or when any of the complexes were incubated with U1ΔSm (Figures 4B and 4C, lanes 6–10). Thus, along with experiments described in Figure 3B, we conclude that Sm proteins regain the competence to form snRNPs as a consequence of their transfer onto the SMN complex and the concomitant dissociation of pICln. In contrast, we failed to activate the minimal Gemin2/SMNΔC dimer for snRNP assembly upon incubation with either 6S or pICln/D3/B complex (Figure 4D, lanes 2–4). As described in Figure 3B, the incubation of Gemin2/SMNΔC with the 6S complex results in a stalled transfer reaction intermediate. We hypothesized that removal of pICln would resolve this stalled state and enable Sm subcore formation. To address this, a complex composed of Gemin2/SMNΔC/D1/D2/E/F/G was reconstituted from recombinant proteins (Figure S6, hereafter referred to as the 7S complex). Indeed, this complex promoted efficient assembly of the Sm subcore in a strictly Sm site-dependent manner (Figure 4D, lanes 5 and 10). From these experiments we conclude that Sm core formation directly correlates with the capability of the SMN complex to dissociate pICln from the Sm proteins. Furthermore, assembly of the Sm core per se requires only a minimal set of subunits of the SMN complex in vitro, namely SMN and Gemin2. Our recent finding of a minimal SMN complex in Drosophila melanogaster composed of the same two proteins further corroborates the latter conclusion (Kroiss et al., 2008Kroiss M. Schultz J. Wiesner J. Chari A. Sickmann A. Fischer U. Evolution of an RNP assembly system: A minimal SMN complex facilitates formation of UsnRNPs in Drosophila melanogaster.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 10045-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and Supplemental Discussion). As both the 6S (pICln/D1/D2/E/F/G) and 7S (Gemin2/SMNΔC/D1/D2/E/F/G) complexes contain the same set of Sm proteins, it was intriguing to ask what makes the first one incompetent and the latter suitable for Sm subcore formation. We reasoned that the transition from the inactive to an activated state is accompanied by structural rearrangements. To address this, we conducted electron microscopic (EM) studies of the reconstituted 6S complex; the stalled Sm protein transfer intermediate from 6S to SMN complexes, designated as the 8S complex (Gemin2/SMNΔC/pICln/D1/D2/E/F/G); and the 7S complex as a subunit of the SMN complex functional in RNP formation. Due to their decreased susceptibility to proteolysis, we turned to the highly homologous Drosophila counterparts of the respective complexes. As shown in Figures 5A–5D, left panel, these complexes could be efficiently reconstituted from single proteins and purified to homogeneity. Gel filtration of these complexes indicated molecular masses consistent with a monomeric stoichiometry of each constituent. Moreover, the Drosophila complexes conform to the identical biochemical characteristics described above for their respective human counterparts (data not shown). Typical negatively stained EM fields of all three purified, reconstituted complexes revealed a monodisperse population of asymmetric single particles with well-defined, distinct structural features (Figures 5A–5D, middle panels). All four analyzed data sets (6S, 8S[6S+SMNΔCGemin2], 8S[7S+pICln], 7S particles) showed preferential binding orientation of the particles on the carbon film (87%–94% of the particle views; see Figure S7 for details). Class averages of the 6S complex exhibit a ring-like architecture with a central accumulation of stain (Figure 5A, middle and right panels). These particles had a maximum diameter of about 8–8.5 nm. Notably, these dimensions are comparable to those reported for the Sm core domain (Kastner and Lührmann, 1989Kastner B. Lührmann R. Electron microscopy of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles: shape of the particle and position of the 5′ RNA terminus.EMBO J. 1989; 8: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, the shape of assembly active 7S complexes was strikingly different (Figure 5D, middle and right panels). Class averages showed elongated particles with a length of about 11.5 nm. Importantly, the closed ring observed in 6S complexes was now converted into an open clamp (upper domain), which is packed against a foot-like protuberance (lower domain). Thereby, the opening of the clamp (oriented to the right side in Figure 5D) was found in proximity to the foot-like domain. The transfer intermediate 8S complex still contained the ring shape of the 6S complex (upper domain) but displayed, additionally, a foot-like protuberance as the 7S complex (lower domain) (Figures 5B and 5C, middle and right panels). Notably, the ring domain of this particle had a diameter of about 8–8.5 nm and, hence, has very similar dimensions"

https://openalex.org/W2014744254,"The c-myc proto-oncogene is induced by mitogens and is a central regulator of cell growth and differentiation. The c-myc product, Myc, is a transcription factor that binds a multitude of genomic sites, estimated to be over 10-15% of all promoter regions. Target promoters generally pre-exist in an active or poised chromatin state that is further modified by Myc, contributing to fine transcriptional regulation (activation or repression) of the afferent gene. Among other mechanisms, Myc recruits histone acetyl-transferases to target chromatin and locally promotes hyper-acetylation of multiple lysines on histones H3 and H4, although the identity and combination of the modified lysines is unknown. Whether Myc dynamically regulates other histone modifications (or marks) at its binding sites also remains to be addressed. Here, we used quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP) to profile a total of 24 lysine-acetylation and -methylation marks modulated by Myc at target promoters in a human B-cell line with a regulatable c-myc transgene. Myc binding promoted acetylation of multiple lysines, primarily of H3K9, H3K14, H3K18, H4K5 and H4K12, but significantly also of H4K8, H4K91 and H2AK5. Dimethylation of H3K79 was also selectively induced at target promoters. A majority of target promoters showed co-induction of multiple marks - in various combinations - correlating with recruitment of the two HATs tested (Tip60 and HBO1), incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z and transcriptional activation. Based on this and previous findings, we surmise that Myc recruits the Tip60/p400 complex to achieve a coordinated histone acetylation/exchange reaction at activated promoters. Our data are also consistent with the additive and redundant role of multiple acetylation events in transcriptional activation."

In Caenorhabditis elegans, the CED2/5/10/12 pathway regulates actin during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, whereas the role of the CED1/6/7 pathway in phagocytosis is unclear. We report that Undertaker (UTA), a Drosophila Junctophilin protein, is required for Draper (CED-1 homolog)-mediated phagocytosis. Junctophilins couple Ca2+ channels at the plasma membrane to those of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Ryanodine receptors. We place Draper, its adaptor drCed-6, UTA, the Ryanodine receptor Rya-r44F, the ER Ca2+ sensor dSTIM, and the Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ channel dOrai in the same pathway that promotes calcium homeostasis and phagocytosis. Thus, our results implicate a Junctophilin in phagocytosis and link Draper-mediated phagocytosis to Ca2+ homeostasis, highlighting a previously uncharacterized role for the CED1/6/7 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2058015311,"The pathogen Staphylococcus aureus uses iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins to scavenge the essential nutrient iron from host hemoproteins. The IsdH protein (also known as HarA) is a receptor for hemoglobin (Hb), haptoglobin (Hp), and the Hb-Hp complex. It contains three NEAT (NEAr Transporter) domains: IsdHN1, IsdHN2, and IsdHN3. Here we show that they have different functions; IsdHN1 binds Hb and Hp, whereas IsdHN3 captures heme that is released from Hb. The staphylococcal IsdB protein also functions as an Hb receptor. Primary sequence homology to IsdH indicates that it will also employ functionally distinct NEAT domains to bind heme and Hb. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance methods to localize the Hp and Hb binding surface on IsdHN1. High affinity binding to these structurally unrelated proteins requires residues located within a conserved aromatic motif that is positioned at the end of the β-barrel structure. Interestingly, this site is quite malleable, as other NEAT domains use it to bind heme. We also demonstrate that the IsdC NEAT domain can capture heme directly from Hb, suggesting that there are multiple pathways for heme transfer across the cell wall.

Staphylococcus aureus causes a wide range of life threatening diseases such as pneumonia, septicemia, osteomyelitis, toxic shock syndrome, and cardiomyelitis (1Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4673) Google Scholar). The rise of antibiotic resistance has created a pressing need for new drugs to treat infections caused by this microbe as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) now accounts for up to ∼65% of all clinical isolates, and new multidrug resistant strains have emerged that are resistant to vancomycin, the preferred antibiotic of last resort to treat MRSA infections (2Kluytmans-Vandenbergh M.F. Kluytmans J.A. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2006; 12: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Bacterial growth is limited by the availability of iron, which is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in microbial metabolism. Although the human body contains large quantities of iron, little is directly available to S. aureus because it is sequestered intracellularly or bound to the carrier glycoproteins transferrin and lactoferrin. To overcome this bacteriostatic limitation, S. aureus has evolved a variety of mechanisms to assimilate iron (3Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar, 4Brown J.S. Holden D.W. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Of special interest are recently discovered iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) 5The abbreviations used are: Isd, iron-regulated surface determinant; Hb, hemoglobin; MetHb, methemoglobin; Hp, haptoglobin; NEAT, NEAR iron transporter; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ZnPPIX, zinc protoporphyrin IX; RU, response units; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. proteins, which extract heme bound iron from host hemoproteins (5Maresso A.W.

The Isd system likely plays a significant role in virulence as heme contains ∼75% of the body's total iron, and it is the S. aureus preferred source of iron (9Skaar E.P. Humayun M. Bae T. DeBord K.L. Schneewind O. Science. 2004; 305: 1626-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). As sequence homologs of Isd proteins are also found in a number of other important pathogens (e.g. Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus anthracis, and Streptococcus pyogenes), a greater understanding of the Isd system could lead to the development of new therapeutically useful anti-infective agents (10Andrade M.A. Ciccarelli F.D. Perez-Iratxeta C. Bork P. Genome Biology. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0047)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Schneewind O. J.

Hemoglobin (Hb) in red blood cells contains large quantities of heme iron to which S. aureus gains access by secreting cytolytic toxins (leukocidin and α- and δ-hemolysin) (13Wiseman G.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1975; 39: 317-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Release of Hb from lysed erythrocytes significantly dilutes the protein, causing it to dissociate and oxidize into methemoglobin (MetHb), a dimeric form of Hb that contains single α and β globin chains as a heterodimer, each bound to a ferric heme (14Umbreit J. Am. J. Hematol. 2007; 82: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 15Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Visca P. Altruda F. Tolosano E. Beringhelli T. Fasano M. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because heme readily dissociates from MetHb and it can cause severe oxidative damage to host tissues or serve as a microbial nutrient, several host mechanisms exist to remove it from circulation (16Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). First, heme-laden MetHb present in the blood is tightly bound by the serum glycoprotein haptoglobin (Hp), and the Hp-MetHb complex is cleared from circulation by receptor-mediated endocytosis in the liver parenchymal cells (17Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K. Moestrup S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 18Okuda M. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, free heme in the blood is eliminated when it binds to hemopexin and serum albumin proteins (15Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Visca P. Altruda F. Tolosano E. Beringhelli T. Fasano M. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Recent studies have begun to elucidate how S. aureus circumvents these clearance systems to gain access to heme iron. Free heme present in the blood can be scavenged by the heme transport system, a membrane protein complex that pumps heme into the cytoplasm (9Skaar E.P. Humayun M. Bae T. DeBord K.L. Schneewind O. Science. 2004; 305: 1626-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Heme is also aggressively acquired by capturing it from circulating MetHb and the Hp-MetHb complex using the Isd system (6Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 19Dryla A. Gelbmann D. von Gabain A. Nagy E. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although both the heme transport and Isd systems import heme and are important for virulence, Staphylococcal strains with disrupted Isd components cause less persistent infections in mice than wild-type strains and are unable to utilize Hb as an iron source in cell cultures (20Torres V.J. Pishchany G. Humayun M. Schneewind O. Skaar E.P. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8421-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 21Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Su K. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2293-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The Isd pathway consists of nine proteins that work in concert to acquire heme (5Maresso A.W. Schneewind O. Biometals. 2006; 19: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O.

Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. Biometals. 2007; 20: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Three receptor proteins are covalently anchored to the cell wall by the SrtA sortase and are displayed on or near the cell surface (IsdA, IsdB, and IsdH (also known as HarA (haptoglobin receptor A))) (6Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 19Dryla A.

Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, a fourth receptor, IsdC, is attached to the cell wall by the SrtB sortase enzyme (21Mazmanian S.K. Ton-That H. Su K. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2293-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). MetHb is captured by IsdH and IsdB (6Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8421-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although these proteins share a high degree of sequence homology with one another, only IsdH is capable of binding Hp (19Dryla A. Gelbmann D. von Gabain A. Nagy E. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Dryla A. Hoffmann B. Gelbmann D. Giefing C. Hanner M. Meinke A. Anderson A.S. Koppensteiner W. Konrat R. von Gabain A. Nagy E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, full-length IsdB binds to heme (6Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), whereas it is unknown if IsdH can also bind to this molecule. The IsdA protein binds heme and may play a general role in bacterial adhesion, as the isolated protein interacts with an array of extracellular matrix proteins (22Clarke S.R. Wiltshire M.D. Foster S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). After capture by the surface receptors, heme is thought to be transferred to IsdC, which is presumably embedded within the cell wall because it resists proteolytic degradation in whole cell digestion studies (6Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The IsdC protein then passes the heme molecule to the membrane transporter IsdDEF complex where it is imported into the cytoplasm. Finally, iron is released when the tetrapyr-role ring is cleaved by the monooxygenase IsdG or its paralog IsdI (24Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 436-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest that heme imported by the Isd system can be directly incorporated in microbial proteins (8Reniere M.L. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. Biometals. 2007; 20: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Isd receptors IsdA, IsdB, IsdC, and IsdH bind to proteins and heme using NEAT (NEAR iron transporter) domains. These conserved binding modules are ∼125 residues in length and are named for their prevalence in bacterial genes whose genomic positioning is proximal to putative Fe3+ siderophore transporter genes (10Andrade M.A. Ciccarelli F.D. Perez-Iratxeta C. Bork P. Genome Biology. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0047)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NEAT domains are also found in putative surface proteins in a number of other Gram-positive pathogens where they presumably function in iron import. Studies of isolated NEAT domains from S. aureus have revealed that different domains bind to distinct ligands. For example, some NEAT domains only bind heme (e.g. IsdC) or only to other proteins (e.g. the first and second domains of IsdH), whereas other NEAT domains can bind both of these ligands (e.g. IsdA) (19Dryla A. Gelbmann D. von Gabain A. Nagy E. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22Clarke S.R. Wiltshire M.D. Foster S.J. Mol.

NMR and crystallography studies have revealed that NEAT domains adopt a β-sandwich fold that shares structural homology with immunoglobin-like proteins (23Dryla A. Hoffmann B. Gelbmann D. Giefing C.

In addition, the structures of the IsdC- and IsdA-heme complexes have revealed the mechanism of heme binding (26Grigg J.C. Vermeiren C.L. Heinrichs D.E. Murphy M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Sharp K.H. Schneider S. Cockayne A. Paoli M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 31591-31600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown how NEAT domains interact with other proteins. The IsdH protein captures MetHb and Hp on the cell surface (19Dryla A. Gelbmann D. von Gabain A. Nagy E. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicates that it contains three NEAT domains: IsdHN1, IsdHN2, and IsdHN3 (Fig. 1A). Although the IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains bind to MetHb and Hp, the function of the C-terminal IsdHN3 domain is unknown (19Dryla A. Gelbmann D. von Gabain A. Nagy E. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this study we systematically investigated the functions of NEAT domains within IsdH. We show using alanine scanning mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) that Hp and MetHb bind at the same site on IsdHN1. Interestingly, this site is also used by the IsdA and IsdC NEAT domains to bind heme, suggesting that that this surface is particularly well suited for recognizing a range of distinct ligands (26Grigg J.C. Vermeiren C.L. Heinrichs D.E. Murphy M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Sharp K.H. Schneider S. Cockayne A. Paoli M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 31591-31600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We also show that the previously uncharacterized IsdHN3 domain binds heme and that it can capture this molecule from MetHb. A model of heme transfer is proposed in which domains IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 first bind MetHb or the Hp-MetHb complex on the cell surface. Heme is then captured by the adjacent IsdHN3 domain before subsequent transfer through the cell wall. Protein Expression and Purification—The first NEAT domain from IsdH consists of residues Ala86 to Leu229 and is referred to as IsdHN1 (Fig. 1A). Two versions of IsdHN1 were studied. For the heme transfer assay, untagged IsdHN1 was produced from a pet11a vector (Novagen) and purified as previously described (25Pilpa R.M. Fadeev E.A. Villareal V.A. Wong M.L. Phillips M. Clubb R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Pilpa R.M. Clubb R.T. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 33: 137Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For the binding studies using SPR, a histidine-tagged fusion of IsdHN1 was used (his-IsdHN1, residues Ala86 to Leu229 with the sequence Met-Gly-Ser-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His-Ser-Ser-Gly-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser-His-Met at its N terminus). Briefly, the DNA for IsdHN1 was PCR-amplified from S. aureus chromosomal DNA (strain RN4220) using primers that incorporated NdeI and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the DNA, respectively. This PCR product was then digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into a similarly cut pET15b vector. Plasmids encoding single amino acid mutants ofHis-IsdHN1 were constructed from the pET15b vector bearing the IsdHN1 sequence using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmids of either His-tagged wild-type or mutant IsdHN1 were harvested 4 h after the addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 rpm at 4 °C in a JA-10 rotor, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 2.5 mm benzamidine (Acros), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), protease inhibitor mixture II (Roche Applied Science)), and lysed by 3 cycles of sonication. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 12,000 rpm in a SS-34 rotor. The supernatant was then applied to Talon nickel affinity beads (Clontech), and the His-tagged fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. All His-IsdHN1 mutants were checked for proper folding using one-dimensional NMR (data not shown). Two proteins were used as heme receptors in the heme transfer assay, histidine-tagged IsdC (His-IsdC, residues Ser25 to Gly150), and histidine-tagged C-terminal NEAT domain from IsdH (His-IsdHN3, residues Thr540 to Gln664). Both proteins were expressed from pET15b plasmids (Novagen) and contained the amino acid sequence Met-Gly-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His-Ser-Ser-Gly-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser-His-Met at their N termini. Plasmid construction and protein purification procedures were identical to those used forHis-IsdHN1 (described above). The amount of heme associated with His-IsdC and His-IsdHN3 was determined using a pyridine hemochrome assay (30Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). After purification, ∼2-3% of His-IsdHN3 and His-IsdC was bound to heme. Enzyme-linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA)—An ELISA was used to test His-IsdHN3 binding to a variety of proteins. ELISA plate wells (Nunc microwell plates, Fisher Scientific) were coated with a 150-μl solution containing 20 μg/ml lyophilized bait protein. The bait proteins were dissolved in PBS buffer (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.0) and included fetuin (Sigma), apotransferrin (Sigma), holo-transferrin (Sigma), Hp (Athens Research), or Hb (Sigma). Additionally, commercially available fibronectin precoated plates (Sigma) were used to test fibronectin interactions. After the bait proteins were incubated at room temperature for 1 h on a Nutator, the wells were washed 3 times with PBS buffer and blocked with 100 μl of a bovine serum albumin solution (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) dissolved in PBS buffer for 1 h with nutation. The wells were then washed 3 times with PBS to remove excess blocking solution, and varying amounts of His-IsdHN3 were added to each well (0 to 30 pmol/well). Interactions between His-IsdHN3 and protein ligands were then detected by adding nickel-labeled horseradish peroxidase according to the manufacturer's directions (Express Detector Nickel-HRP, KPL). After incubating for 1 h at 37 °C, the wells were washed with PBS to remove unbound nickel-labeled horseradish peroxidase, and the binding of His-IsdHN3 was quantified by measuring the conversion of the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in citric phosphate buffer, pH 5, to a colored product using an automated ELISA reader (Molecular Devices, SpectraMax M5). As a positive control similar experiments were performed using His-IsdHN1 protein instead of His-IsdHN3. Metalloprotoporphyrin Affinity Measurements—UV and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to determine the affinity of IsdHN3 for metalloprotoporphyrins. In the UV assay the soret band of His-IsdHN3 at 402 nm was monitored as a function of heme (iron protoporphyrin XI) added. The concentration of His-IsdHN3 was held constant at 1 μm in buffer A (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl), and hemin was added in small aliquots from a 1 mm stock solution (hemin dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH). After pH adjustment, the UV absorbance was measured and plotted as a function of heme concentration to yield a binding curve. All UV measurements were performed using a PharmaSpec UV-1700 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The affinity of IsdHN3 for the heme analog zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) was determined using fluorescence spectroscopy. In this assay the concentration of ZnPPIX was held constant, and its fluorescence was monitored as a function of protein added. Binding reactions contained 150 μl of 7.5 μm ZnPPIX (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in binding buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate; 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Aliquots of His-IsdHN3 from a 125 μm stock solution were added to a final concentration of 50 μm. Fluorescence was measured using a Quanta Master Model QM5 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International) at room temperature. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 365 and 585 nm, respectively. Binding data were fit to the equation A = Af + (Aa - Af)(Ka[L]/1+ Ka[L]), where A is the fluorescence emission, Af is the fluorescence emission of free ZnPPIX, Ab is the fluorescence of bound ZnPPIX, L is the concentration of ligand (heme) added, and Ka is the association constant (31Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Data were fit using the program SigmaPlot 2000. SPR Affinity Measurements—Binding of IsdHN1 to immobilized MetHb was measured by SPR. MetHb was immobilized on a CM5 chip using the following procedure. First, a 0.1 mg/ml stock solution of MetHb was prepared by dissolving commercially available MetHb (Sigma) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, 100 mm NaCl. The stock solution was then diluted to 1 μg/ml in Biacore binding buffer (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5) and immobilized on a CM5 chip using N-ethyl-N-(dimethylaminopropyl)carboiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the manufacturers instructions. After MetHb immobilization, the final measured response units (RU) of the CM5 chip was ∼1000. Measurement of IsdHN1 binding was performed at 10 °C. Wild-type and mutant IsdHN1 was flowed over the MetHb-conjugated surface at a rate of 85 μl/min with a contact time of 150 s and a dissociation time of 300 s. SPR measurements were taken at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 nm IsdHN1 using buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, 100 mm NaCl) as the flow buffer. A similar procedure was used to measure IsdHN1 binding to Hp. Haptoglobin from pooled human plasma (Athens research) was immobilized on a CM5 chip using the aforementioned methods. This protein consists of two alleles of haptoglobin, α-1 and α-2. These proteins differ in their oligomerization state as a result of differences in their amino acid sequence. A 100 μg/ml solution of Hp dissolved in Biacore binding buffer was immobilized so as to yield a haptoglobin conjugated chip with a RU of ∼1000. SPR experiments were performed on a Biacore T100 instrument, and the data were analyzed using the program BIAevaluation 4.01 (Amersham Biosciences). Heme Transfer Assay—A total of 0.3 μmol of either His-IsdHN3 or His-IsdC was incubated with 750 μl of Talon beads (Clontech) dissolved in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl) for 1 h. The beads were then centrifuged, washed, and equilibrated in buffer B (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 0.8% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich)). UV measurements and SDS-PAGE analysis of the wash and beads confirmed that the protein was bound. The beads were then incubated on a rotary with a 5 μm solution of MetHb dissolved in 10 ml of buffer B. The incubation time was varied from 0 to 300 min. The beads were then centrifuged, and the absorbance of the supernatant at 411 nm was measured. For transfer experiments that included IsdHN1, MetHb was first incubated with 3 mol eq of IsdHN1 for 90 min. The program SigmaPlot 2000 was used to fit the transfer data to the equation A = (Af - A0)(1 - etkobs) + A0, where A0 is the initial absorbance of the MetHb solution prior to incubating with IsdHN3, and Af is the final absorbance of MetHb in the eluate. Under the conditions we have used kobs is approximately equal to the rate of heme release from the β subunit. This is because at the end of the assay ∼50% of the MetHb dimers contain a single heme molecule, and previous studies have shown that the β chain within MetHb binds heme less tightly that the α chain (32Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions the heme transfer reaction is, therefore, described by the following equilibrium equation, where MH2 is MetHb containing two heme molecules, MH is MetHb with a single heme molecule bound to its α chain, N is the IsdHN3 NEAT domain, H is free heme, and NH is IsdHN3 bound to a single heme molecule. As described by Hargrove et al. (32Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a simple expression for the rate of change of MH2 can be derived by assuming that d[H]/dt ∼ 0 and that the concentration of free heme is much smaller than the concentration of heme bound to protein (i.e. [H] [tlt] [MH2] + [MH] + [NH] ∼ [H]total). When these conditions are met the observed rate constant shows the following dependence. This equation indicates that the initial kinetics of transfer are described by a single exponential where the observed rate constant is equal to the rate at which heme is released from the β subunit of MetHb (kobs ∼ k-H) because [MH]/[N] ∼ 0. In principle, more complex binding behavior will be observed in which the data is biphasic. For example, as the ratio of [MH]/[N] increased, the reaction could accelerate if k-N > k-H, decelerate if k-N < k-H, or remain the same if k-N = k-H. However, these effects are expected to be small and difficult to detect experimentally. The Same Site on IsdHN1 Binds to MetHb and the Structurally Unrelated Hp Protein—Previous studies have shown that the IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains within IsdH bind MetHb and Hp (19Dryla A.

TRAF6 and the downstream kinase TAK1 have been shown to be essential for the production of proinflammatory cytokines through the TLR/MyD88/TRIF pathway. Although binding of TRAF6 with IPS-1 has been demonstrated, the role of the TRAF6 pathway in IFN-α/β production has not been fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that TRAF6 is critical for IFN-α/β induction in response to viral infection and intracellular double-stranded RNA, poly(I:C). Activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38, but not IRF3, was impaired in TRAF6-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts in response to vesicular stomatitis virus and poly(I:C). However, TAK1 was not required for IFN-β induction in this process, since normal IFN-α/β production was observed in TAK1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts. Instead, another MAP3K, MEKK1, was important for the activation of the IFN-β promoter in response to poly(I:C). Forced expression of MEKK1 in combination with IRF3 was sufficient for the induction of IFN-β, whereas suppression of MEKK1 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited the induction of IFN-β by poly(I:C). These data suggest that IPS-1 requires TRAF6 and MEKK1 to activate NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases that are critical for the optimal induction of type I interferons.

Upon recognition, the PRRs trigger intracellular signaling pathways that induce the production of antiviral mediators, such as type I interferons (IFN-α/β), IFN-stimulated genes, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines, such as IP-10. The expression of type I IFNs and other antiviral proteins suppresses viral replication and facilitates the adaptive immune responses. dsRNA is one of the viral components recognized by TLR3 and RNA helicases, such as RIG-I and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5). TLR3 recognizes extracellular viral dsRNA internalized into the endosomes in a certain type of cells, such as DCs, whereas RIG-I and MDA5 detect intracellular viral dsRNA in various types of cells, including fibroblasts (4Yoneyama M.

Sugiyama M. Yamamoto M. Watanabe Y. Kawai T. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4304-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Both TBK1 and IKK-i subsequently activate a transcription factor, IRF3, resulting in the initial expression of IFN-β (11Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T.

Another IRF (IFN-regulatory factor) family member, IRF7, which is induced by the initial IFN-β, elicits further induction of type I IFN genes, including IFN-α and IFN-β (13Honda K. Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2006; 25: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Stimulation with TLR3 ligand also activates other transcription factors, including NF-κB and AP-1, which is thought to synergize with IRF3 to induce type I IFN genes (14Theofilopoulos A.N. Baccala R.

On the other hand, RIG-I/MDA5 bind to intracellular RNA through the C-terminal helicase domain and initiate downstream signaling cascades through the N-terminal CARD domains (4Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M.

Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Häcker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 21Oganesyan G. Saha S.K.

Therefore, both TLR3 and RIG-I/MDA5 pathways converge at the TBK1/IKK-i kinase complex. IPS-1 contains multiple TRAF-interacting motifs (TIMs) in the proline-rich region, which can associate with the C-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF3 (22Saha S.K. Pietras E.M. He J.Q. Kang J.R. Liu S.Y. Oganesyan G. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Shiba T.L. Wang Y. Cheng G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IPS-1 has been shown to interact with other TRAF family members, such as TRAF6 and its downstream MAP3K, TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1) (18Xu L.G. Wang Y.Y. Han K.J. Li L.Y. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Both TRAF6 and TAK1 have been demonstrated to play a critical role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages and DCs triggered by MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88)-mediated signals from the Toll-like/IL-1 receptor family (23Sato S.

Immunity. 2003; 19: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The TRAF6/TAK1 signal activates a canonical IKK complex, IKKα/β/γ, resulting in the activation of NF-κB as well as MAPK cascades leading to the activation of AP-1 (25Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Although TRAF6/TAK1 has been implicated in proinflammatory cytokine production induced by TLR ligands, the involvement of these molecules in the regulation of type I IFN production induced by the RLH pathway is largely unknown. In this report, we show that MEFs lacking TRAF6 exhibit a defect in the production of IFN-α/β in response to VSV infection and dsRNA, poly(I:C). On the contrary, MEFs lacking TAK1 showed normal induction of IFN-α/β. We also show that another MAP3K, MEKK1, instead of TAK1 is involved in the expression of IFN-β upon dsRNA stimulation. Both TRAF6 and MEKK1 are required for NF-κB activation but not for IRF3 activation, implicating the requirement of these molecules for the optimal induction of type I IFN in the cytosolic viral recognition systems. Cells and Reagents—Wild-type and TRAF6-deficient MEFs were prepared from day 13.5–14.5 embryos, as described previously (24Kobayashi T. Walsh P.T. Walsh M.C. Speirs K.M. Chiffoleau E. King C.G.

MEFs and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fatal bovine serum (Cell Culture Technologies, Switzerland), penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine (Nacalai Tesque, Japan). Conventional DCs were generated from the spleen of 2-week-old wild-type or TRAF6 knock-out mice, as described previously (24Kobayashi T. Walsh P.T. Walsh M.C. Speirs K.M. Chiffoleau E. King C.G.

Briefly, erythrocyte-removed splenic cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 7 days. Less adherent cells were collected by gentle pipetting and used as DCs. All experiments using these mice were approved by and performed according to the guidelines of the animal ethics committee of Kyushu University (Fukuoka, Japan). Poly(I:C) was purchased from Sigma. The anti-FLAG, M2 (Sigma), anti-T7 (Novagen), anti-HA, HA.11 (Covance), anti-IRF3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies were used.

Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). The debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), using Chemi-Lumi One L Western blotting detection reagents (Nacalai Tesque). For native PAGE assay, MEFs were seeded at 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. 24 h later, cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml of poly(I:C) using FuGENE HD for 3 h and then harvested. The cells were lysed with native PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol). The extracts were separated on a 7.5% native PAGE and then immunoblotted with anti-IRF3 antibody. RT-PCR and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from MEFs using the RNA-iso (Takara) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and then cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied BioSystems, CA). The cDNA was used as a template for PCR using KOD-plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Japan) or real time PCR using the SYBR Green system (Applied BioSystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene-specific primer sequences are as follows: G3PDH, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′; IFN-α, 5′-ATGGCCTCGCCCTTTGCTTTACTG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTGCTCTGACAACCTCCCAGG-3′; IFN-β, 5′-TCCAAGAAAGGACGAACATTCG-3′ and 5′-TGAGGACATCTCCCACGTCCA-3′; IP-10, 5′-GTGTTGAGATCATTGCCACG-3′ and 5′-GCTTACAGTACAGAGCTA-3′; RANTES, 5′-CCCTCACCATCATCCTCACT-3′ and 5′-CCTTCGAGTGACAAACACGA-3′. Luciferase Reporter Assay—For the reporter gene assays, HEK293T cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates, or MEFs were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid and expression plasmids as indicated, using polyethyleneimine or FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured by using the luciferase assay system and chemiluminescent reagents (Promega). A plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Detection of Cell Death—MEFs were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate 1 day prior to treatment. The cells were left untreated or infected with VSV at the indicated multiplicity of infection. After 12 h, cells were trypsinized and collected with the supernatants, and the cell viability was determined by propidium iodide (Sigma) and Annexin V (Sigma) staining using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences). Confocal Microscopy—MEFs were seeded on a glass coverslip 1 day prior to treatment. The cells were transfected with 10 μg/ml poly(I:C) for 3 h, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After incubation in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 5 min, the cells were incubated with anti-IRF3 and anti-p65 antibodies, followed by ALEXA-488 and ALEXA-546-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). The cells were observed under a confocal laser microscope (LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss). Virus Preparation—VSV was propagated with vero cells. The titration of VSV was determined by plaque assay using vero cells. RNA Interference—For siRNA experiments, double-stranded RNA duplexes composed of 21-nucleotide sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized. RNA oligonucleotides used for targeting mouse MEKK1 and mouse MEKK3 in this study were as follows: MEKK1#1 sense, 5′-GGUAGGAGCUGUGAUGUAUdTdT-3′; MEKK1#2 sense, 5′-GCUGCUUAUUCUCUAGAAAdTdT-3′; MEKK3 sense, 5′-GGAGGUGAGUGCUCUGGAGdTdT-3′. MEFs were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) was used to transfect MEFs with 40 nm siRNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, knockdown efficiency of the transfected siRNA on MEKK1 and MEKK3 mRNA expression was confirmed by RT-PCR. The primers were as follows: MEKK3, 5′-TACCTGAGCGACAACAGCAC-3′ and 5′-TTCGGGGAAATGTTCTTCTG-3′; MEKK1, 5′-CGGAACACCATCCAGAAGTT-3′ and 5′-TCTCCTGATTCCTTCGCTGT-3′. TRAF6 Is Required for Type I IFN Production Induced by Intracellular dsRNA—TRAF6 is an essential adaptor protein for production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-12, in macrophages and DCs in response to TLR ligands (24Kobayashi T. Walsh P.T. Walsh M.C. Speirs K.M. Chiffoleau E. King C.G. Hancock W.W. Caamano J.H. Hunter C.A. Scott P. Turka L.A. Choi Y. Immunity. 2003; 19: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, the role of TRAF6 in antiviral immunity and type I IFN production has not been clarified. To address this issue, we first infected TRAF6-deficient MEFs with the IFN-sensitive prototypic rhabdovirus, VSV. TRAF6-deficient MEFs were more vulnerable to virus infection than wild-type MEFs. Virus-induced cytolysis and Annexin V-positive fraction, including early apoptotic cells and dead cells, were markedly increased after 12-h infection in TRAF6-deficient MEFs compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1A). This was probably due to reduced IFN production in TRAF6-deficient MEFs, because the enhanced cell death of the mutant MEFs was rescued by adding exogenous IFN-β (Fig. 1A). To investigate the role of TRAF6 in type I IFN induction, MEFs as well as conventional DCs (cDCs) from wild-type and TRAF6-deficient mice were infected with VSV. Induction of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IP-10 was almost completely diminished in TRAF6-deficient cDCs (Fig. 1B) and remarkably reduced in TRAF6-deficient MEFs (Fig. 1C, left). To mimic intracellular dsRNA generated during viral replication, we also transfected synthetic dsRNA, poly(I:C), into MEFs, using a lipid-based transfection reagent, FuGENE HD. Up-regulation of IFN-α/β mRNA, but not IP-10 mRNA, was also severely impaired in TRAF6-deficient MEFs in response to poly(I:C) (Fig. 1C, right). These data suggest that TRAF6 is required for type I IFN production induced by intracellular dsRNA. TRAF6 Is Involved in the RLH/IPS-1 Pathway to Activate the IFN-β Promoter—To understand the molecular mechanism by which TRAF6 induces type I IFNs in the context of intracellular dsRNA recognition, we first transfected wild-type MEFs with poly(I:C) using FuGENE HD and then examined the effect of inhibitors of various signaling molecules downstream of TRAF6 on IFN-β production (Fig. 2A). The up-regulation of mRNA expression for IFN-β and IP-10 induced by poly(I:C) was strongly suppressed by inhibitors of IKK (IKK-2 inhibitor VI), JNK (SP60025), and p38 (SB203580) but not by an inhibitor of MEK (upstream of ERK) (U0126), suggesting that the activation of IKK, p38 and JNK pathways is required for IFN-β expression. Next we transfected HEK293T cells with IRF3, TRAF6, or both constructs along with an IFN-β promoter-luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2B). Although overexpression of TRAF6 can activate both IKK and MAPK pathways required for IFN-β expression, the IFN-β promoter was only marginally activated by TRAF6 overexpression. However, cotransfection of TRAF6 and IRF3 exhibited a strong activation of the promoter, indicating that TRAF6 and IRF3 cooperatively activate the IFN-β promoter. Taken together, these results support the notion that the optimal activation of IFN-β promoter by intracellular dsRNA requires the coordinate activation of transcription factors IRF3, NF-κB, and ATF-2/c-Jun (14Theofilopoulos A.N. Baccala R. Beutler B. Kono D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 307-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 15Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Next we investigated whether TRAF6 functions at the downstream of the RIG-I/IPS-1 pathway. Overexpression of either RIG-IN (constitutively active form of RIG-I) or IPS-1 activated IFN-β promoter in HEK293T cells, whereas this was strongly suppressed by forced expression of the dominant negative form of TRAF6 (DN-TRAF6) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C, left). Similarly, DN-TRAF6 suppressed NF-κB activation induced by RIG-IN or IPS-1 (Fig. 2C, right). To ensure the role of TRAF6 in the RLH-mediated pathway, we further examined the IFN-β reporter assay in TRAF6-deficient MEFs. As shown in Fig. 2D, the activation of IFN-β promoter as well as NF-κB induced by forced expression of IPS-1 or transfection with poly(I:C) was severely impaired in TRAF6-deficient cells. These results suggest that RLH/IPS-1 pathway activates NF-κB via TRAF6, which is essential for the full activation of the IFN-β promoter. To further dissect the signaling pathways downstream of TRAF6, we assessed the activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. As shown in Fig. 2E, the homodimerization of IRF3, reflecting the activation of the molecule, was induced by poly(I:C) in MEFs even in the absence of TRAF6. To observe the nuclear translocation of IRF3 as well as NF-κB subunit, p65, we stimulated wild-type and TRAF6-deficent MEFs with poly(I:C) along with FuGENE HD and then stained the cells with anti-IRF3 and anti-p65 antibodies (Fig. 2F). Three hours after stimulation, ∼30% of knock-out MEFs exhibited nuclear translocation of IRF3, which was comparable with that of wild-type MEFs. These results indicate that the activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 are independent of TRAF6. However, nuclear translocation of p65 was impaired in TRAF6-dficient MEFs. Although all of the wild-type MEFs exhibited co-localization of p65 and IRF3 in the nucleus, more than 50% of TRAF6-deficient MEFs showed cytoplasmic retention of p65 but nuclear translocation of IRF3 (Fig. 2F). These data are consistent with previous results showing a defective NF-κB activation in the absence of functional TRAF6 in the reporter assay (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, poly(I:C)-induced phosphorylation of JNK and p38 was severely impaired in TRAF6-deficieint MEFs (Fig. 2G). Taken together, TRAF6 appears to contribute to the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways rather than IRF3 activation in the RLH/IPS-1 signaling pathway in MEFs. TAK1 Is Not Essential for RLH/IPS-1-mediated IFN-β Induction—TAK1 is essential for the TRAF6-dependent activation of NF-κB and MAPKs in Toll-like/IL-1 receptor signaling (23Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Hence, we next examined whether TAK1 is involved in the RLH/IPS-1 signaling pathway. First we analyzed the ability of wild-type and TAK1-deficient MEFs to induce type I IFNs in response to VSV infection and poly(I:C) transfection. As shown in Fig. 3A, the induction of IFN-α/β in TAK1-deficient MEFs was comparable with that in wild-type MEFs. IFN-β promoter reporter activity enhanced by IPS-1 or poly(I:C) was not impaired in TAK1-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3B, left). NF-κB activity was also normally elevated by forced expression of IPS-1 in TAK1-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3B, middle), whereas lipopolysaccharide stimulation failed to up-regulate the NF-κB activity in the knock-out cells (Fig. 3B, right). The dimerization of IRF3 induced by poly(I:C) was also not affected by TAK1 deficiency (Fig. 3C). When we examined the nuclear translocation of p65 and IRF3, co-localization of both transcription factors in the nuclei was observed in both wild-type and TAK1-deficient MEFs at the same ratio (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that TAK1 is not required for type I IFN induction in the RLH/IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway. MEKK1 Is a Candidate MAP3K to Induce IFN-β in the RLH/IPS-1 Pathway—Since TAK1 was not necessary for type I IFN induction in the RLH/IPS-1 pathway, we sought a responsible MAP3K involved in the IPS-1/TRAF6-mediated signal. MEKK1 (MEK kinase-1) and MEKK3 have been implicated in the activation of IKK and MAPKK, leading to the activation of NF-κB and JNK (27Symons A. Beinke S. Ley S.C. Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 40-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To examine whether MEKK1 or MEKK3 is involved in the RIG-I/IPS-1 pathway, we performed an IFN-β and NF-κB reporter assay using kinase-inactive mutants of MEKK1 (knMEKK1) and MEKK3 (knMEKK3). As shown in Fig. 4A, IPS-1- and RIG-IN-induced IFN-β promoter and NF-κB activities were inhibited efficiently by knMEKK1 and to a lesser extent by knMEKK3. Next we examined the effect of overexpression of MEKK1 and MEKK3. The forced expression of IRF3, MEKK1, or MEKK3 alone was not sufficient for the activation of the IFN-β promoter; however, cotransfection of IRF3 and MEKK1, but not MEKK3 synergistically activated the promoter activity (Fig. 4B). In order to confirm the significance of endogenous MEKK1 and MEKK3, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. Wild-type MEFs were transfected with scrambled control, MEKK1, or MEKK3 siRNA construct, and then endogenous gene expression of MEKK1 as well as MEKK3 was sufficiently suppressed (Fig. 4C). The knockdown of MEKK1, but not MEKK3, resulted in a severe reduction of IFN-β mRNA expression induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 4C). Induction of mRNA for IP-10 was slightly suppressed in the MEKK1 knockdown MEFs. Significant reduction of IFN-α and IFN-β levels by knockdown of MEKK1 with different siRNA oligonucleotides was also confirmed by real time PCR (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the suppression of type I IFNs by siRNA for MEKK1 was reverted by forced expression of rat MEKK1 (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that endogenous MEKK1 but not MEKK3 is required for type I IFN production induced by cytoplasmic dsRNA. Recent studies have shown that the RLH family of intracellular receptors detect viral nucleic acid and signal through IPS-1 (also known as MAVS, CARDIF, and VISA) during viral infection (1Beutler B.

Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8918) Google Scholar, 3Kawai T. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). IPS-1 recruits TRAF3, which in turn activates TBK1 and IKK-i, leading to the activation of IRF3 (22Saha S.K. Pietras E.M. He J.Q. Kang J.R. Liu S.Y. Oganesyan G. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Shiba T.L. Wang Y. Cheng G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). IPS-1 also activates NF-κB via the FADD/RIP1 pathway mediated by caspase-8 and -10 (16Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar, 28Takahashi K. Kawai T. Kumar H. Sato S. Yonehara S. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4520-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that TRAF6 and MEKK1 were involved in the downstream pathway of IPS-1, which facilitates NF-κB and MAPKs to enhance the type I IFN promoter. It has been shown that there are two distinct types of TIM; one is the PXEXX(acidic or aromatic residue) motif for TRAF6, and the other is the PXQX(T/S) motif for other TRAFs, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3 (29Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). IPS-1 contains multiple TIMs, and TRAF1, -2, -3, -5, and -6 can interact with IPS-1 (data not shown) (see Refs. 18Xu L.G. Wang Y.Y. Han K.J. Li L.Y. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar and 22Saha S.K. Pietras E.M. He J.Q. Kang J.R. Liu S.Y. Oganesyan G. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Shiba T.L. Wang Y. Cheng G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3257-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TRAF3 is required for the activation of IRF3 but not NF-κB (21Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B. He J.Q. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Perry A. Cheng G. Nature. 2006; 439: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), whereas TRAF6 is required for the activation of NF-κB and MAPK but not IRF3. Thus, the IPS-1·TRAF complex is a divergent point of the RLH/IPS-1-mediated signal (Fig. 5). A similar case of the signal divergence regulated by TRAF6 and TRAF3 in the context of MyD88-dependent signaling pathway has been reported (20Häcker H. Redecke V. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Hsu L.C. Wang G.G. Kamps M.P. Raz E. Wagner H. Häcker G. Mann M. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 439: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). IKK and MAPK activities result from the activation of upstream MAP3Ks, such as TAK1, MEKK1, MEKK3, and NIK. In viral infection or dsRNA stimulation, TAK1-deficient cells normally induced type I IFN, and we could not detect the activation of TAK1 in wild-type cells in response to dsRNA (data not shown). Our findings suggest that TAK1 is not very necessary for virus-induced type I IFN production. The TAK1-independent mechanism should be controlled by TRAF6 in the RLH/IPS-1 signal pathway. Thus, we have made an attempt to identify the responsible MAP3K. TRAF6-interacting protein, ECSIT, has been shown to mediate the activation of NF-κB and JNK in TLR pathway (30Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Carothers J. Xiao C. Douglas I. Janeway C.A. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2059-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). ECSIT binds to and activates MEKK1, which in turn activates IKK. MEKK3 has also been implicated in the activation of IKK and MAPKK, leading to the activation of NF-κB and JNK. For instance, the activation of NF-κB and JNK by TLR8 is TAK1-independent but MEKK3-dependent (31Qin J. Yao J. Cui G. Xiao H. Kim T.W. Fraczek J. Wightman P. Sato S. Akira S. Puel A. Casanova J.L. Su B. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21013-21021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, it might be possible that MEKK1 and/or MEKK3 is involved in IPS-1/TRAF6-mediated IKK and MAPK activation. Our results indicate that MEKK1 is involved in the activation of the IFN-β promoter in the RLH/IPS-1-mediated anti-viral signal pathway. Forced expression of MEKK1 and IRF3 cooperatively activated the IFN-β promoter, whereas knockdown of MEKK1 resulted in the reduction of IFN-β production. The knMEKK1 suppressed the NF-κB activation. Therefore, although the precise mechanism currently remains unclear, MEKK1 seems to be necessary for the activation of IPS-1/TRAF6 pathway. Further analysis is necessary to understand how MEKK1, but not TAK1, is activated during viral infection. IPS-1 localizes in the outer mitochondrial membrane; thus, one possibility is that the localization of IPS-1 may induce the downstream kinase differently from that in TLR pathway. IPS-1-deficient mice were found to be defective in the production of type I IFNs in response to all RNA viruses recognized by either RIG-I or MDA5, suggesting a central role in the production of type I IFNs upon viral infection (32Kumar H. Kawai T. Kato H. Sato S. Takahashi K. Coban C. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 33Sun Q. Sun L. Liu H.H. Chen X. Seth R.B. Forman J. Chen Z.J. Immunity. 2006; 24: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). IRF3 and IRF7 were also shown to be indispensable for type I IFN production (34Honda K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Asagiri M. Sato M. Mizutani T. Shimada N. Ohba Y. Takaoka A. Yoshida N. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 35Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2000; 13: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we found that TRAF6-deficient MEFs did not completely lose the ability to induce type I IFNs, probably due to partial NF-κB activation by other mechanisms. It has been reported that IPS-1 interacts with both FADD and RIP1 (16Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). Both FADD and RIP1 have been reported to be critical for the induction of type I IFNs in response to poly(I:C) (36Balachandran S. Thomas E. Barber G.N. Nature. 2004; 432: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that the absence of TRAF6 in the RLH/IPS-1 pathway is compensated for by the signal mediated by FADD and RIP1 to induce type I IFNs. Further investigation is necessary to clarify this point. dsRNA is also recognized by TLR3 in certain cell types, and TRAF6 has been shown to be involved in the pathway depending on TRIF. However, the function of TRAF6 in TLR3 signaling remains controversial. The activation of NF-κB by poly(I:C) is abrogated in TRAF6-deficient MEFs, whereas NF-κB activation occurs normally in TRAF6-deficient macrophages in response to dsRNA (37Gohda J. Matsumura T. Inoue J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 38Jiang Z. Mak T.W. Sen G. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cell type-specific involvement of TRAF6 was suggested in the TRIF-mediated NF-κB activation. Nevertheless, in our data, TRAF6-deficient cDCs infected with VSV showed a severe defect in the production of type I IFNs, indicating that TRAF6 plays an essential role in cDC for type I IFN production in response to RNA viral infection. In the present study, we examined the role of TRAF6, TAK1, MEKK1, and MEKK3 in the RLH/IPS-1-mediated IFN-β induction. Based on data published recently and presented here, we propose a model for a RLH-IPS-1-mediated signaling pathway via TRAF6 (Fig. 5). Upon RNA viral infection, RIG-I or MAD5 recognizes the viral dsRNA and then recruits IPS-1 through the CRAD domain. IPS-1 associates with TRAF3, TRAF6, FADD, and RIP1. TRAF3 activates TBK1/IKK-i, leading to the activation of IRF3, whereas TRAF6 may interact with MEKK1, which in turn contributes to the activation of IKK and MAPKK, leading to the activation of NF-κB and AP-1. These transcription factors cooperatively activate the IFN-β expression. We thank Dr. T. Fujita (Kyoto University) for RIG-I cDNA, M. Ohtsu and K. Fukidome for technical assistance, Y. Nishi for manuscript preparation, and H. Shiraishi for helpful discussion and support."

Although this was previously achieved by lowering the pH, here we have designed a new generation of histidine-rich peptides that adopt a surface alignment at neutral pH. In vitro, this new generation of peptides are powerful antibiotics in terms of the concentrations required for antibiotic activity; the spectrum of target bacteria, fungi, and parasites; and the speed with which they kill. Further modifications to the peptides, including the addition of more hydrophobic residues at the N terminus, the inclusion of a helix-breaking proline residue or using d-amino acids as building blocks, modulated the biophysical properties of the peptides and led to substantial changes in toxicity to human and parasite cells but had only a minimal effect on the antibacterial and antifungal activity. Using a range of biophysical methods, in particular solid-state NMR, we show that the peptides are highly efficient at disrupting the anionic lipid component of model membranes. However, we also show that effective pore formation in such model membranes may be related to, but is not essential for, high antimicrobial activity by cationic amphipathic helical peptides.

Antimicrobial peptides are being developed as a promising alternative for traditional antibiotic strategies (1Hancock R.E.W. Sahl H-G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar) as bacteria increasingly threaten to win the antibiotic arms race. Knowledge of their mechanism of action can be used in the design of more powerful lead compounds; however, these mechanisms remain unclear, and debate continues as to the relative contributions of proposed pore formation or internal killing strategies (2Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar). Cationic amphipathic α-helical peptides comprise an important group of antimicrobial peptides that have been studied quite extensively. Characteristically, these peptides comprise a high positive nominal charge segregated on one surface with a second surface formed of more hydrophobic residues. A number of models have been proposed describing their poreforming activity (3Bechinger B. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 2004; 23: 271-292Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), with a recent in silico study of the action of a magainin peptide (4Leontiadou H. Mark A.E. Marrink S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 12156-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) embracing the accumulated experimental evidence (e.g. see Refs. 5Yandek L.E. Pokorny A. Florán A. Knoelke K. Langel U¨.

The computer simulations show that, above a threshold number of peptides, one peptide molecule becomes deeply embedded in the membrane interface. Subsequently, the membrane/water interface becomes unstable, and solvent molecules from the peptide-free interface are able to interact with suitably hydrophilic groups of the embedded protein, and a contiguous pore develops (4Leontiadou H. Mark A.E. Marrink S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 12156-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Importantly, the peptides in the simulation retain an alignment approximately parallel to the membrane surface, and the acyl chains of lipids that interact with the peptides become strongly disordered, whereas the resulting pore is sufficient for cell contents to be released but importantly, since such behavior has been observed experimentally for magainin 2 (7Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), also allows passage of the peptide from one side of the membrane to the other (4Leontiadou H. Mark A.E. Marrink S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 12156-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These observations agree well with our experimental biophysical studies of the membrane behavior of the cationic amphipathic antibiotic peptide pleurocidin (8Mason A.J. Chotimah I.N.H. Bertani P. Bechinger B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which has pore-forming capabilities (9Saint N. Cadiou H. Bessin Y. Molle G. Biochim. Biophys.

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In particular, we used solid-state 15N NMR methods on uniformly aligned samples to show that at peptide/lipid ratios where such pores are formed, the peptides adopt an orientation approximately parallel to the membrane surface (8Mason A.J.

Furthermore, we used 2H NMR of chain deuterated lipids in mixed model membranes to show that cationic pleurocidin strongly destabilizes anionic lipid acyl chains, in preference to zwitterionic lipids, indicating that such peptides are capable of causing local membrane disruption (8Mason A.J. Chotimah I.N.H. Bertani P. Bechinger B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and pore formation (14Mason A.J. Marquette A. Bechinger B. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 4289-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) while the membrane remains otherwise intact. When using model peptides to study this phenomenon, we showed that histidine-rich cationic amphipathic peptides, such as LAH4, have topologically dependent antibiotic activities (15Mason A.J. Gasnier C. Kichler A. Právost G. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M-H. Bechinger B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 3305-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Vogt T.C.B. Bechinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29115-29121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The LAH4 helix adopts a trans-membrane alignment at neutral pH but flips to lie parallel to the membrane surface when the pH is lowered and the histidine residues become charged (17Bechinger B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). At neutral pH, membrane disruption is weak, but at acidic pH, as determined by solid-state NMR studies of deuterium-labeled lipids in model membranes, the peptides strongly disrupt the acyl chains of the anionic lipid component of model membranes and also cause bacterial lysis (15Mason A.J. Gasnier C. Kichler A. Právost G. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M-H. Bechinger B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 3305-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The antibiotic properties of LAH4 and related peptides therefore become enhanced at acidic pH when the peptide adopts a surface orientation in the membrane (15Mason A.J. Gasnier C. Kichler A. Právost G. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M-H. Bechinger B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 3305-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We also noted that the model histidine-rich peptides had a greater membrane-destabilizing activity than the natural peptide pleurocidin (18Mason A.J. Bechinger B. Kichler A. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2007; 7: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Considering our peptides in terms of the model described above, a histidine-rich peptide with enhanced membrane disruption properties should have excellent poreforming activity, whereas its ability to undertake an intracellular killing strategy, through membrane translocation, may also be improved. To this end, we have designed and prepared histidine-rich peptides that adopt a surface orientation at neutral pH. These peptides all have excellent lipid-destabilizing capabilities in anionic membranes; however, their pore-forming capabilities, as determined by a dye release assay, varied considerably, indicating that pore formation may sometimes only be incidental to other bactericidal effects. We have evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial performance of the peptides and find them to be powerful antibacterial, antifungal, and antiplasmodial agents, whereas the toxicity of the peptides to human cells and Plasmodium falciparum can be related to further modifications to the peptide sequence and chirality, showing that rational design strategies have the potential to mold peptides for a range of applications.

The peptides (Table 1) were synthesized using standard Fmoc solid-state chemistry on a Millipore 9050 synthesizer or an Applied Biosystems 433A peptide synthesizer. In crude peptide preparations, a predominant peak was observed when analyzed by HPLC with acidified acetonitrile/water gradients. During HPLC purification, the main peak was collected, and the identity of the product was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Peptides were lyophilized from 4% acetic acid to remove the trifluoroacetic acid counter ion.

Spectra were recorded from 250 to 190 nm using a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm and a scan speed of 100 nm/min. Peptides in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were added to 200 μl of trifluoroethanol to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Vesicles containing POPC/POPG (75:25) were prepared at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. 240 μl of lipid suspension was added to a 1-mm cuvette, and then 12 μl of peptide solution (2 mg/ml) was added and then thoroughly mixed such that a peptide/lipid molar ratio of 1:40 was maintained. Spectra were treated using Jasco spectra analysis software where a spectrum of the peptide-free solution/suspension was subtracted and, for spectra obtained for vesicles, means movement smoothing with a convolution width of 5 points was applied. Sample Preparation for Solid-state NMR—For solid-state NMR, POPE/POPG-d31, POPC-d31/cholesterol, and POPC/POPS-d31/cholesterol were mixed at a molar ratio of 75:25, 100:30, and 70:30:30, respectively. A total of around 5 mg of lipids/sample were dissolved and mixed in chloroform and dried under rotor evaporation at room temperature. In order to remove all organic solvent, the lipid films were exposed to vacuum overnight. The films were then rehydrated with 5 ml of a suspension of peptide in 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m KCl buffer at pH 7.5 at room temperature. For wide line 2H NMR experiments, peptides were added at 2.5 mol %. The samples were briefly sonicated in a bath sonicator to improve exposure of all lipids to the peptide. Samples were subjected to five rapid freeze-thaw cycles for further sample homogenization and then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature. Previous determination of a partitioning constant of 3.5 × 103 (16Vogt T.C.B. Bechinger B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29115-29121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) for inplane LAH4 and PC vesicles at pH 5 indicates that very little peptide will be free in solution after this process. The pellets, containing lipid vesicles and associated HALO derivatives, were transferred to Bruker 4-mm MAS rotors for NMR measurements. Lipid vesicles were also prepared in this way in the absence of HALO derivatives. Static aligned samples were prepared using a procedure whereby a sublimable solid is co-dissolved with the lipids and peptide to aid alignment during dehydration and rehydration (19Hallock K.J. Henzler-Wildman K. Lee D-K. Ramamoorthy A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2499-2503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 4 mg of HALO, carrying two 15N-leucine labels at positions Leu-12 and Leu-14 was co-dissolved with POPE/POPG (75:25) or POPC/cholesterol (100:30) in chloroform at 2.5 mol %. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas and redissolved in a solution of chloroform containing naphthalene. The molar ratio of naphthalene to lipid was 1:1. The solution was layered over 15 thin glass plates (9 × 22 mm; Marienfeld GmbH, Lauda-Ko¨nigshofen, Germany), and the plates were then exposed to high vacuum overnight. The samples were rehydrated at 93% humidity and at 37 °C. Solid-state NMR—2H quadrupolar echo experiments (20Davis J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 117-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) for samples containing POPG-d31 or POPC-d31 were performed at 46.10 MHz on a Bruker Avance 300 NMR spectrometer using a 4-mm MAS probe without rotation, spectral width of 200 kHz, and with recycle delay, echo delay, acquisition time, and 90° pulse lengths of 0.3 s, 42 μs, 2 ms, and 5 μs respectively. The temperature was maintained at 37 °C to keep the bilayers in their liquid-crystalline phase. During processing, the first 40 points were removed in order to start Fourier transformation at the top of the echo. Spectra were zero-filled to 8192 points, and 50-Hz exponential line broadening was applied. Smoothed deuterium order parameter profiles were obtained from symmetrized and dePaked 2H NMR powder spectra of POPG-d31 or POPC-d31 using published procedures (21Scha¨fer H. Ma¨dler B. Volke F. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 116: 145-149Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Sternin E. Bloom M. MacKay A.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 55: 274-282Google Scholar, 23Seelig A. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4839-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). 15N cross-polarization (CP) spectra of static aligned samples were acquired at 40.54 MHz for 15N on a Bruker Avance 400 NMR spectrometer equipped with a double resonance flat-coil probe. An adiabatic CP pulse sequence was used with a spectral width, acquisition time, CP contact time, and recycle delay time of 25 kHz, 10 ms, 800 μs, and 3 s, respectively. The 1H π /2 pulse and spinal64 heteronuclear decoupling field strengths were 42 kHz. 40,960 scans were accumulated and the spectra were zero-filled to 4096 points, and 100-Hz exponential line broadening was applied during processing. Spectra were externally referenced to 15NH4Cl at 41.5 ppm. Dye Release Assay—Large unilamellar vesicles loaded with calcein were prepared by mechanical extrusion. Three lipid mixtures, POPE/POPG (75:25), POPC supplemented with 40 mol % of cholesterol, and POPC/POPS (75:25) supplemented with 40 mol % cholesterol, were dissolved separately in chloroform/methanol. The solutions were dried and then hydrated in PBS buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) with 50 mm of calcein ions (calcein disodium salt; Fluka, Switzerland) before undergoing several freeze-thaw cycles and then extrusion (11 times) through a 200-nm pore membrane (Avestin). The calcein-entrapped vesicles were separated from the dye solution by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column (2.5 × 3.5 mm) (Sigma) loaded with PBS buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) supplemented with 75 mm NaCl in order to compensate for the change in osmolarity induced by the presence of calcein molecules and Na+ counter ions. The concentrations of the large unilamellar vesicle suspensions eluting from the column were determined by comparing 100% dye release from suspensions before and after the gel filtration step. A dilution factor of ∼7 after gel filtration was usual. Calcein efflux measurements were performed on a Fluorolog 3-22 spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin-Yvon, Longjumeau, France). In a typical experiment, 10.5 μl of the large unilamellar vesicle solution (3 mg/ml) was added to 1.5 ml of PBS buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) in a quartz cuvette and equilibrated for some minutes at 37 °C inside the spectrometer. 7 μl of peptide solution (2 mg/ml) were added into the cuvette while the sample was excited at λexc = 480 nm, and the intensity of fluorescence (I) was recorded at λfluo = 515 nm for about 10 min. A spectral bandwidth of 1 nm was used for both excitation and emission. The percentage of calcein released from the vesicles (I%) was calculated according to the formula, I% = 100 × (I – I0)/(Imax – I0), where I0 represents the intensity of fluorescence before adding the peptide to the solution, and Imax is the maximum intensity observed after dissolving the vesicle with 10 μl of 10% Triton X-100. Care was taken to maintain constant Imax in order to allow quantitative comparison between the multiple recordings. Antibacterial Assays—For details of strains tested, see the supplemental material. The antibacterial activities of the peptides were tested using a Mueller-Hinton Broth medium (Difco). Bacteria were first grown aerobically with vigorous shaking at 37 °C, and aqueous peptides solutions (10 μl) were incubated in a 96-well microplate with 100 μl of a mid-logarithmic phase culture of bacteria with a calculated starting A620 nm of 0.001 (∼2.5 × 105 colony-forming units/ml). Microbial growth was assessed by the increase of A620 nm after an 18-h incubation at 37 °C, and the value of control cultures growing without peptide was taken as 100%. Each assay was performed in triplicate, and the antibacterial activity is evaluated with the minimal inhibitory concentration inhibiting 100% of bacterial growth (MIC100). Scanning Electron Microscopy—Bacteria (Escherichia coli RSO2 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 52156) were grown to exponential phase (A620 nm = 0.5) into 3 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth and then centrifuged at 6 °C at 5000 × g and further washed in distilled H2O. The final bacterial pellet was fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4. The suspension was then applied to coverslips pre-coated with poly-l-lysine for scanning electron microscopy and kept in a hydrated chamber for cells to adhere for 2 h. Attached cells were rinsed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer at pH 7.4, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol. The coverslips were mounted on stubs and sputter-coated with gold. Samples were examined in a Cambridge Stereoscan 360. Antifungal/Yeast Assay—The following filamentous fungi strains were used: Tricophyton mentagrophytes, Neurospora crassa, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Spores at a final concentration 104 spores/ml were suspended in a growth medium containing potato dextrose broth (Difco, BD Biosciences Microbiology Systems) at half-strength, supplemented with tetracycline (10 mg/ml) and cefotaxime (0.1 mg/ml). Aliquots of peptide (10 μl) were incubated in microtiter plates with 90 μl of fungal spore cultures. Fungal growth was assessed microscopically after an appropriate incubation period (24 or 48 h at 30 °C). Similarly, yeast cells were precultured in a Sabouraud medium with starting absorbance of 0.001 at 620 nm. Two strains were tested: Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. Growth of yeast was monitored and evaluated by measuring the culture absorbance at 620 nm, using a microplate reader. Finally, MIC100 was calculated as the minimal concentration completely inhibiting cell growth. Antiplasmodial Assay—Erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum were cultivated using the candle-jar technique using the chloroquine-sensitive strain 3D7 (24Cranmer S.L. Magowan C. Liang J. Coppel R.L. Cooke B.M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1997; 91: 363-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The peptides, diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, were distributed on 96-well tissue culture plates with different concentrations. For each plate tested, three control wells were peptide-free, and each concentration was studied in triplicate. The blood samples were washed three times with a solution of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES (Sigma) and 25 mm NaHCO3 (Sigma). The blood samples were then resuspended in the same supplemented culture medium. If necessary, a dilution was performed by adding uninfected O-positive-group erythrocytes (EFS-Alsace, France) to obtain a 1% parasite density and a hematocrit value of 2%. The plates were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C using the candle jar technique. The inhibition concentration was determined according to the effect of different peptide concentrations on the parasitemia, estimated in the 96-well test plate after 1, 2, 3, or 4 days. For the estimation of the parasitemia, light microscopy of a thin blood film stained with Giemsa was used. For IC50 calculation, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for detection of pLDH secreted by P. falciparum similarly as described recently (25Doderer C. Heschung A. Guntz P. Cazenave J.P. Hansmann Y. Senegas A. Pfaff A.W. Abdelrahman T. Candolfi E. Malar. J. 2007; 6: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Values for differing concentrations of peptides were plotted on a standard curve, and the IC50 value for each peptide was determined using linear regression analysis. 3-(4,5-Dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay—Cytotoxicity was evaluated by performing the MTT (Sigma) assay (26Alley M.C. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Hursey M.L. Czerwinski M.J. Fine D.L. Abbott B.J. Mayo J.G. Shoemaker R.H. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) was supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (w/v) of fetal calf serum (FCS; HyClone). 90,000 human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) or 120,000 SV40 transformed human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 V2) per well were plated in 24-well plates (Costar) 1 day before the assay. The cells were incubated with peptide solutions for 4 h in the presence or absence of 10% (v/v) FCS. Cells were incubated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 as a positive control (100% toxicity), whereas untreated cells were used as a negative control. The cell culture medium was then removed and replaced by serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (450 μl) and 50 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The medium was then removed, and 500 μl of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals produced from the reduction of MTT by viable cells, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. The value reported for the EC50, the concentration of peptide causing 50% toxicity, is based on nonlinear regression analysis of logarithmic serial dilution experiments performed in duplicate. Nine peptide concentrations, distributed above and below the expected EC50, were tested. For each combination of peptide and cell line, the relationship between toxicity and peptide concentration was modeled using a logistic curve of the following form,Toxicity=50×(1+eb−g×EC50)1+eb−g×concentrationwhere b, g, and EC50 are fitted parameters. Initial estimates were obtained by inspection of data plots and then optimized iteratively using the nonlinear least squares function in the R statistics package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). S.E. and significance levels were taken from the R output. Analysis of variance of the EC50 point estimates was performed to investigate peptide and cell line differences. Flow Cytometry—MRC5 and MRC5-V2 cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested in a trypsin-EDTA/PBS solution (1:1), and finally stained with propidium iodide (IP) and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate as described by BD Pharmingen. Ten thousand IP-negative MRC5 and MRC5-V2 cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences) for Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining. Peptide Design—Since LAH4 and its derivatives have much improved antibiotic activity at acidic pH when the peptide adopts an in-plane orientation with respect to the membrane (15Mason A.J. Gasnier C. Kichler A. Právost G. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M-H. Bechinger B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 3305-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we designed peptides that retained the essential elements of the LAH4 peptides, namely the α-helicity and positioning of the histidine residues, while incorporating structural features that would provoke an in-plane orientation at neutral pH (Table 1). In a previous study (15Mason A.J. Gasnier C. Kichler A. Právost G. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M-H. Bechinger B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 3305-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we prepared a series of LAH4 isomers that differed in the angle subtended by the histidine residues when the peptide adopts an α-helical conformation, and hence some consideration is required in selecting one of these peptides as the starting point for the new generation of peptides. Although early studies of lytic amphipathic helices showed that increasing the hydrophilic angle led to a reduction of hemolytic activity (27Tytler E.M. Segresi J.P. Epand R.M. Nie S-Q. Epand R.F. Mishra V.K. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1993599378,"Computer-generated virtual faces become increasingly realistic including the simulation of emotional expressions. These faces can be used as well-controlled, realistic and dynamic stimuli in emotion research. However, the validity of virtual facial expressions in comparison to natural emotion displays still needs to be shown for the different emotions and different age groups.Thirty-two healthy volunteers between the age of 20 and 60 rated pictures of natural human faces and faces of virtual characters (avatars) with respect to the expressed emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and neutral. Results indicate that virtual emotions were recognized comparable to natural ones. Recognition differences in virtual and natural faces depended on specific emotions: whereas disgust was difficult to convey with the current avatar technology, virtual sadness and fear achieved better recognition results than natural faces. Furthermore, emotion recognition rates decreased for virtual but not natural faces in participants over the age of 40. This specific age effect suggests that media exposure has an influence on emotion recognition.Virtual and natural facial displays of emotion may be equally effective. Improved technology (e.g. better modelling of the naso-labial area) may lead to even better results as compared to trained actors. Due to the ease with which virtual human faces can be animated and manipulated, validated artificial emotional expressions will be of major relevance in future research and therapeutic applications."

Efficiency and fidelity of DNA polymerase ι opposite N2-ethyl-Gua was determined by steady state kinetic analysis with Mg2+ or Mn2+ as the activating metal.

The N2-ethyl-Gua adduct is a strong block to DNA replication by replicative DNA polymerases in vitro and in cells (6Perrino F.W. Blans P. Harvey S. Gelhaus S.L. McGrath C. Akman S.A. Jenkins G.S.

Structures of bacteriophage DNA polymerase (pol) RB69, a homolog of human DNA pol α, indicate a possible mechanism of N2-ethyl-Gua blocked DNA replication. The structures reveal a DNA-binding motif that contacts the DNA minor groove and functions as an important safeguard to replication fidelity (8Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The blocking of replicative DNA pols by N2-ethyl-Gua could arise when the ethyl group, protruding into the minor groove, disrupts protein:DNA contacts involved in the proposed “checking mechanism” (8Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). N2-Ethyl-Gua also has a high mis-coding potential during DNA replication with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA pol I (9Terashima I. Matsuda T. Fang T.W. Suzuki N. Kobayashi J. Kohda K. Shibutani S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutations caused by N2-ethyl-Gua range from single base deletions to transversions (10Upton D.C. Wang X. Blans P. Perrino F.W. Fishbein J.C. Akman S.A. Mutat. Res. 2006; 599: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Y family DNA polymerases η, ι, and κ replicate through adducted DNA templates (6Perrino F.W. Blans P. Harvey S. Gelhaus S.L. McGrath C. Akman S.A. Jenkins G.S. Lacourse W.R. Fishbein J.C. Chem.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The multitude of Y family DNA pols suggests that a variety of mechanisms might be utilized by these polymerases during lesion bypass dependent upon the nature of the specific DNA adducts. Structural data indicate that DNA pol ι rotates unadducted template purines from the anti to syn conformation in ternary complexes and forms hydrogen bonds between the Hoogsteen edge of the template base and the Watson-Crick edge of the incoming nucleotide (15Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 2004; 430: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 16Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K.

Structure. 2006; 14: 749-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies show that DNA pol ι has increased efficiency and fidelity during nucleotide insertion opposite template purines (11Choi J.Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12315-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L.

Toxicol. 2005; 18: 1451-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similarly, rotation of the template base to the syn conformation is observed in the structure of DNA pol ι complexed with the 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine lesion, allowing correct nucleotide insertion but not subsequent extension opposite the adduct (21Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Rotation of the purine base at the active site of DNA pol ι would allow for efficient bypass of DNA adducts at the N2 of Gua by repositioning the adduct into the major groove and removing potential steric overlap between the lesion and incoming nucleotide. Thus, DNA pol ι could be involved in the bypass of the minor groove DNA adduct N2-ethyl-Gua. The DNA polymerases utilize two divalent metal ions for activation of catalysis (22Beese L.S. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14095-14101Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 23Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 24Yang W. Lee J.Y. Nowotny M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 5-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The metals play a role in binding and positioning of the incoming nucleotide and in determining fidelity during catalysis (24Yang W. Lee J.Y. Nowotny M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 5-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 25Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.C. Kunkel T.A. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Mg2+ ion is often used as the activating metal for DNA polymerization studies in vitro (24Yang W. Lee J.Y. Nowotny M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 5-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The Mn2+ ion also binds to and activates DNA polymerases but frequently results in decreased fidelity of the replicative DNA polymerases (26Sirover M.A. Loeb L.A. Science. 1976; 194: 1434-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 27Sirover M.A. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2331-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, the Mn2+ ion has been shown to increase the efficiency and fidelity of nucleotide incorporation by DNA pol ι opposite a template Thy nucleotide (28Frank E.G. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24689-24696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The strong blocking effect of N2-ethyl-Gua to the replicative DNA polymerases and its possible role in alcohol-related cancers have prompted our studies on bypass of N2-ethyl-Gua by the Y family DNA pol ι. These data provide new insights into replication bypass of the ethanol-derived N2-ethyl-Gua adduct with potential carcinogenic consequences. The structures of DNA pol ι complexed with N2-ethyl-Gua containing DNA provide direct evidence for the initial anti position of the N2-ethyl-Gua that is subsequently rotated into the syn position upon binding the correct Cyt nucleotide but not upon binding the incorrect Thy nucleotide. The N2-ethyl moiety is easily accommodated in the major groove binding pocket of DNA pol ι by the specific repositioning of Lys309 located in a loop of the PAD domain. The Lys309 hydrogen bonding to the 5′ phosphate of the N2-ethyl-Gua template base in the anti orientation repositions to accommodate the ethyl side chain. This repositioning of Lys309 defines the available space for accommodation of relatively small adducts such as the alkyl lesions at the N2 position of Gua for efficient replication past these lesions by DNA pol ι. Furthermore, we show that when Mn2+ is the activating divalent metal, DNA pol ι bypass of N2-ethyl-Gua occurs with increased efficiency but reduced fidelity compared with Mg2+, demonstrating that Mn2+ could play an important role in modulating efficiency and fidelity of lesion bypass of minor groove purine adducts like N2-ethyl-Gua by the Y family DNA polymerases. Consequences of Mn2+ as the activating metal and flexibility of the DNA pol ι PAD domain for efficient bypass of N2-ethyl-Gua are discussed. Oligonucleotides—N2-Ethyl-Gua phosphoramidites and template oligonucleotides were prepared as described previously (6Perrino F.W. Blans P. Harvey S. Gelhaus S.L. McGrath C. Akman S.A. Jenkins G.S. Lacourse W.R. Fishbein J.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Three DNA primer oligonucleotides, 5′-(6-FAM)-GCTCCGGAACCC-3′, 5′-(6-FAM)-GCTCCGGAACCCTT-3′, and 5′-(6-FAM)-GCTCCGGAACCCTTC-3′, were purchased from Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). For crystallization experiments, a self-annealing DNA oligonucleotide containing the N2-ethyl-Gua adduct and a dideoxy CMP at the 3′ end, 5′-TCTXGGGTCCTAGGACCddC-3′ (where X = N2-ethyl-Gua), was synthesized by Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX) using the supplied N2-ethyl-Gua phosphoramidites. Synthesis was carried out using cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry, and protecting groups were removed by hydrolysis with concentrated ammonium hydroxide (20Perrino F.W. Harvey S. Blans P. Gelhaus S. Lacourse W.R. Fishbein J.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 1451-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The oligo was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (mass calculated = 5503.7, mass observed = 5504.9). Expression and Purification of Human DNA Polymerase ι— The recombinant catalytic fragment of human DNA pol ι (amino acids 1–420) was made as an maltose-binding protein-DNA pol ι fusion protein with a PreScission Protease cleavage site seven residues from the DNA pol ι N-terminal methionine. The PreScission Protease recognition sequence and DNA pol ι coding sequence were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmid constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta 2 cells (Novagen) for overexpression. Cells were grown to an A600 = 0.5 at 37 °C and quickly cooled on ice to 17 °C. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were allowed to grow for 15 h at 17 °C. Cell extracts were prepared and the maltose-binding protein-DNA pol ι fusion protein was bound to an amylose resin in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mm NaCl. The fusion protein was cleaved overnight by on-column incubation with PreScission Protease at 4 °C. The recovered DNA pol ι was purified to homogeneity using phosphocellulose chromatography. Assays—For primer extension assays the DNA primer (12-mer) was hybridized to the 32-mer DNA template and added to reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm dNTP, 10 nm DNA pol ι, and the amount of MgCl2 or MnCl2 indicated in the figure legends. Incubations were for 15 min at 37 °C and reactions were quenched with EtOH. Samples were dried and resuspended in 5 μl of a 95% formamide/dye solution. Extension products were separated on 23% urea-polyacrylamide gels, and imaged with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and quantified using ImageQuant software. For the kinetic assays, the site-specific insertion procedure of Boosalis et al. (29Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. DNA primers (14-mer for insertion and 15-mer for extension) were hybridized to the 32-mer DNA templates and added to reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2 or 0.075 mm MnCl2, 50 nm primer-template, and 0.625 nm DNA pol ι (Mg2+-activated reactions), or 0.2 nm DNA pol ι (Mn2+-activated reactions). The amounts of DNA pol ι in reactions yielded ∼20% extended product maximally. Incubations were for 10 min at 37 °C and reactions were processed as described above. All extended product bands were used to determine kinetic parameters (Km and kcat values) by non-linear regression using SigmaPlot 8.02 software (SPSS Science, Inc.). Relative insertion frequencies were calculated as 1/[(kcat/KM,correct)/(kcat/KM,incorrect)]. Crystallization of Human DNA Pol ι—The purified catalytic fragment of DNA pol ι was dialyzed into 20 mm NaPO4 monobasic, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 mm NaCl and concentrated to ∼11 mg/ml. The DNA pol ι was mixed at a 1:1.2 molar ratio with the N2-ethyl-Gua containing DNA oligonucleotide. To study ternary complexes, MgCl2 and dCTP (or dTTP) were added to final concentrations of 10 and 20 mm, respectively. Crystals grew from solutions described by Nair et al. (16Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Structure. 2005; 13: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) containing 0.2–0.4 m (NH4)2SO4, 12.5–15% PEG 5000 monomethyl ether, and 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5). Crystal trays were kept at 4 °C and diffraction quality crystals appeared in 1–3 days. The crystals belonged to space group P6522 and had cell dimensions of a = b = 98.53 Å, c = 202.35 Å for dCTP containing crystals, and a = b = 98.64 Å, c = 202.23 Å for dTTP containing crystals, and α = β = 90°, γ = 120°. For data collection crystals were step soaked for 5 min in mother liquor solutions containing 0–25% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Structure Determination and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data were collected using CuKα radiation from an in-house MicroMax 007 generator on a Saturn 92 CCD detector (Rigaku). The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using d*TREX (30Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar), and phases were calculated using molecular replacement. Molecular replacement with Phaser (31McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) generated a unique solution using DNA pol ι (Protein Data Bank code 2ALZ) minus DNA as a search model. Electron density maps calculated to 2.5 Å (dCTP) and 2.9 Å (dTTP) showed clear density around the N2-ethyl-Gua lesion. The dCTP ternary structure showed good electron density for the incoming nucleotide. Electron density for incoming dTTP could not be seen except for the γ phosphate, which was included in the model. Models were built in COOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22480) Google Scholar) and refined in REFMAC5 using translesion systhesis refinement (33Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13702) Google Scholar). The refined model converged to an Rcryst = 23.2% and Rfree = 28.6% for the dCTP-containing complex and Rcryst = 23.6% and Rfree = 28.2% for the dTTP-containing complex. Ramachandran plots for the refined models show good stereochemistry, with 87.4 (dCTP-containing) and 88.6% (dTTP-containing) of residues in the favored regions and 0.0 (dCTP-containing) and 0.0% (dTTP-containing) in the disallowed regions. Figures were prepared using PyMol (35Delano W.L. PyMol. 2002; (Delano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA)Google Scholar). Primer Extension Reactions—DNA polymerase ι catalyzes bypass of the N2-ethyl-Gua adduct using Mg2+ or Mn2+ as the activating divalent metal ion. DNA polymerases can utilize various activating divalent metals (22Beese L.S. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14095-14101Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 23Beese L.S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 24689-24696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and recent evidence indicates that both Mg2+ and Mn2+ are potent activators of DNA pol ι with perhaps Mn2+ being the preferred metal ion for activation (28Frank E.G. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24689-24696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The DNA pol ι catalyzed bypass of N2-ethyl-Gua was tested using Mg2+ or Mn2+ as the activating metal (Fig. 1). A 12-mer DNA primer was annealed to 32-mer DNA templates with the primer 3′ terminus positioned three nucleotides from the target N2-ethyl-Gua or Gua (Fig. 1A). Upon incubation of the primer-template with DNA pol ι the 12-mer primer is extended to generate products 13 to 19 nucleotides in length and no full-length 25-nucleotide products are observed (Fig. 1, B and C). These data are consistent with the previously described poor primer extension properties of DNA pol ι, which exhibits especially low efficiency when copying template pyrimidines like those positioned 5′ to the target site in this template design (18Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 36Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650PubMed Google Scholar, 37Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7099-7108Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Primer extension reactions performed in the presence of increased concentrations of MgCl2 (Fig. 1B) or MnCl2 (Fig. 1C) show that DNA pol ι exhibits considerable sensitivity to the divalent ion concentration as indicated by the observed products. The maximum level of primer extension was detected using either DNA template at 2 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 1B) and 0.075 mm MnCl2 (Fig. 1C). Higher concentrations of MgCl2 and MnCl2 reduce DNA pol ι-catalyzed extension (Fig. 1, B and C, see also Ref. 28Frank E.G. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24689-24696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These data indicate that DNA pol ι-catalyzed primer extension using the N2-ethyl-Gua and Gua DNA templates is similar and that the maximum extension is achieved at a ∼26-fold lower concentration of Mn2+ ion compared with Mg2+. Insertion of the correct dCMP and incorrect dTMP opposite Gua and N2-ethyl-Gua by DNA pol ι is detected using either Mg2+ or Mn2+ as the activating metal. The 15-nucleotide products are detected as a doublet band corresponding to the correct incorporation of two dTMP nucleotides opposite the template adenines to generate the 14-nucleotide products and subsequent incorporation of dCMP or dTMP opposite the target Gua and N2-ethyl-Gua by DNA pol ι (Fig. 1, B and C). The product band corresponding to dCMP insertion opposite template Gua, but not template N2-ethyl-Gua, was detected at the higher MgCl2 concentrations tested suggesting that DNA pol ι extends the N2-ethyl-Gua:Cyt base pair more efficiently than the normal Gua:Cyt base pair when Mg2+ is the activating metal ion (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 7 and 8 to 15 and 16). The presence of the 15-nucleotide product band corresponding to insertion of dTMP opposite the target Gua and N2-ethyl-Gua in the most active primer extension reactions indicates that DNA pol ι extends more efficiently from the correctly base paired Gua:Cyt and N2-ethyl-Gua:Cyt 3′ termini relative to extension from the mispaired Gua:Thy and N2-ethyl-Gua:Thy termini (Fig. 1, B and C). The triplet band corresponding to the 16-nucleotide position indicates additional heterogeneity in the oligonucleotide product 3′ terminal sequence likely resulting from the low level of nucleotide discrimination by DNA pol ι during nucleotide incorporation opposite template cytosines (37Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7099-7108Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Efficiency and Fidelity of N2-Ethyl-Gua Bypass by DNA Pol ι—A steady state kinetic assay was used to more precisely quantify the efficiency and fidelity of DNA pol ι bypass of N2-ethyl-Gua compared with Gua in the presence of MgCl2 or MnCl2. Nucleotide insertion reactions were performed in the presence of increased concentrations of dCTP or dTTP using primed templates with the 3′ terminus positioned one nucleotide before the N2-ethyl-Gua or Gua. Extension reactions were performed in the presence of increased concentrations of the next correct nucleotide dGTP using primed templates with the 3′ Cyt or Thy positioned opposite the N2-ethyl-Gua or Gua. These data were quantified and the summary presented in Tables 1 and 2.TABLE 1Nucleotide insertion opposite Gua and N2-ethyl-Gua by DNA pol ι Km and kcat values were determined by quantifying gel band intensities using ImageQuant, and non-linear regression analysis of product versus [dNTP] curves, using SigmaPlot 8.0.2.Metal iondNTPKmkcatkcat/KmRelative insertion frequencyaRelative insertion frequency is calculated as 1/([kcat/Km, correct]/[kcat/Km, incorrect])μmmin–1min–1 μm–1At template N2-ethyl-Gua0.075 mm Mn2+Cyt0.10 ± 0.012425 ± 154.3 × 1031Thy0.030 ± 0.014225 ± 257.5 × 1031/0.62 mm Mg2+Cyt36 ± 374 ± 122.1 × 1001Thy650 ± 180115 ± 181.8 × 10–11/12At template Gua0.075 mm Mn2+Cyt0.15 ± 0.020700 ± 404.7 × 1031Thy0.085 ± 0.020200 ± 152.4 × 1031/22 mm Mg2+Cyt49 ± 4112 ± 182.3 × 1001Thy220 ± 6050 ± 62.3 × 10–11/10a Relative insertion frequency is calculated as 1/([kcat/Km, correct]/[kcat/Km, incorrect]) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Extension from Gua:Cyt, Gua:Thy, and N2-ethyl-Gua:Cyt, N2-ethyl-Gua:Thy base pairs by DNA pol ι Km and kcat values were determined by quantifying gel band intensities using ImageQuant, and non-linear regression analysis of product versus [dNTP] curves, using SigmaPlot 8.0.2.Metal ionBase pairKmkcatkcat/KmRelative extension frequencyaRelative extension frequency is calculated as 1/([kcat/Km, correct]/[kcat/Km, incorrect])μmmin–1min–1 μm–1At template N2-ethyl-Gua0.075 mm Mn2+N2-Et-Gua:CytbEt, ethyl0.10 ± 0.012210 ± 72.1 × 1031N2-Et-Gua:Thy0.30 ± 0.0271.0 ± 0.023.3 × 1001/6402 mm Mg2+N2-Et-Gua:Cyt40 ± 190 ± 42.3 × 1001N2-Et-Gua:Thy160 ± 400.31 ± 0.031.9 × 10–31/1180At template Gua0.075 mm Mn2+Gua:Cyt0.25 ± 0.045220 ± 108.8 × 1021Gua:Thy1.1 ± 0.091.3 ± 0.041.2 × 1001/7302 mm Mg2+Gua:Cyt200 ± 30110 ± 85.5 × 10–11Gua:Thy170 ± 300.18 ± 0.0131.1 × 10–31/500a Relative extension frequency is calculated as 1/([kcat/Km, correct]/[kcat/Km, incorrect])b Et, ethyl Open table in a new tab The DNA pol ι inserts the correct dCMP or incorrect dTMP nucleotide at high efficiency in the presence of Mn2+. The efficiency (kcat/Km) of dCMP insertion by DNA pol ι opposite N2-ethyl-Gua in the presence of Mn2+ is ∼2,000-fold higher than that measured in the presence of Mg2+, and there is a similar high efficiency for dCMP insertion opposite Gua in the presence of Mn2+ compared with Mg2+. The dramatically higher efficiency measured in the presence of Mn2+ can be attributed to a ∼340-fold lower Km value and a ∼6-fold higher kcat value during correct nucleotide incorporation for both DNA templates (Table 1). The efficiency of incorrect dTMP insertion by DNA pol ι opposite N2-ethyl-Gua in the presence of Mn2+ is ∼42,000-fold higher than that in the presence of Mg2+ and ∼10,000-fold higher opposite Gua using Mn2+ compared with Mg2+. Similar to that observed during correct nucleotide insertion, the higher efficiency for incorrect nucleotide insertion measured in the presence of Mn2+ is mostly attributable to a much lower Km value for the nucleotide using both DNA templates. These data suggest that DNA pol ι binds correct and incorrect incoming nucleotides with greater affinity and catalyzes nucleotide addition more rapidly in the Mn2+-activated reaction compared with the Mg2+-activated reaction. The DNA pol ι exhibits higher fidelity of nucleotide insertion opposite N2-ethyl-Gua and Gua when activated with Mg2+ compared with Mn2+. Relative insertion frequencies calculated for incorrect dTMP opposite N2-ethyl-Gua and Gua in the presence of Mg2+ are lower compared with those measured using Mn2+ indicating an increased level of fidelity in the presence of Mg2+. Of particular note is the 20-fold higher level of nucleotide discrimination observed opposite N2-ethyl-Gua in the presence of Mg2+ compared with Mn2+ indicating a metal-dependent increase in the level of nucleotide discrimination opposite the adducted N2-ethyl-Gua by DNA pol ι. These data are similar to previous observations that Mn2+ causes a decreased fidelity in the replicative DNA polymerases (26Sirover M.A. Loeb L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2060280186,"The facial expression of contempt has been regarded to communicate feelings of moral superiority. Contempt is an emotion that is closely related to disgust, but in contrast to disgust, contempt is inherently interpersonal and hierarchical. The aim of this study was twofold. First, to investigate the hypothesis of preferential amygdala responses to contempt expressions versus disgust. Second, to investigate whether, at a neural level, men would respond stronger to biological signals of interpersonal superiority (e.g., contempt) than women. We performed an experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in which participants watched facial expressions of contempt and disgust in addition to neutral expressions. The faces were presented as distractors in an oddball task in which participants had to react to one target face. Facial expressions of contempt and disgust activated a network of brain regions, including prefrontal areas (superior, middle and medial prefrontal gyrus), anterior cingulate, insula, amygdala, parietal cortex, fusiform gyrus, occipital cortex, putamen and thalamus. Contemptuous faces did not elicit stronger amygdala activation than did disgusted expressions. To limit the number of statistical comparisons, we confined our analyses of sex differences to the frontal and temporal lobes. Men displayed stronger brain activation than women to facial expressions of contempt in the medial frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. Conversely, women showed stronger neural responses than men to facial expressions of disgust. In addition, the effect of stimulus sex differed for men versus women. Specifically, women showed stronger responses to male contemptuous faces (as compared to female expressions), in the insula and middle frontal gyrus. Contempt has been conceptualized as signaling perceived moral violations of social hierarchy, whereas disgust would signal violations of physical purity. Thus, our results suggest a neural basis for sex differences in moral sensitivity regarding hierarchy on the one hand and physical purity on the other."
https://openalex.org/W1994024295,"The Src-family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) Lyn is the most important Src-family kinase in B cells, having both inhibitory and stimulatory activity that is dependent on the receptor, ligand, and developmental context of the B cell. An important role for Lyn has been reported in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia, as well as certain solid tumors. Although several Src-family inhibitors are available, the development of Lyn-specific inhibitors, or inhibitors with reduced off-target activity to Lyn, has been hampered by the lack of structural data on the Lyn kinase. Here we report the crystal structure of the non-liganded form of Lyn kinase domain, as well as in complex with three different inhibitors: the ATP analogue AMP-PNP; the pan Src kinase inhibitor PP2; and the BCR-Abl/Src-family inhibitor Dasatinib. The Lyn kinase domain was determined in its “active” conformation, but in the unphosphorylated state. All three inhibitors are bound at the ATP-binding site, with PP2 and Dasatinib extending into a hydrophobic pocket deep in the substrate cleft, thereby providing a basis for the Src-specific inhibition. Analysis of sequence and structural differences around the active site region of the Src-family PTKs were evident. Accordingly, our data provide valuable information for the further development of therapeutics targeting Lyn and the important Src-family of kinases.

Accordingly, our data provide valuable information for the further development of therapeutics targeting Lyn and the important Src-family of kinases. Lyn is a member of the Src family of intracellular membrane-associated tyrosine kinases. While the N terminus of each member is unique, this family shares significant homology in the kinase domain, as well as the SH2/SH3 protein interaction domains. Tyrosine phosphorylation controls the activity of Lyn, and other Src family kinases, in two opposing ways (1Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 2Ingley E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail (pTyr508 in Lyn) inhibits activity through promoting its association with the kinases own SH2 domain. In contrast, phosphorylation of a residue within the activation loop (pTyr397) results in activation of the enzyme. Enzymatic inhibition is also enhanced by the binding of the kinases SH3 domain to a left-handed polyproline type II helix situated between the SH2 and kinase domains (2Ingley E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The SH2 and SH3 domains are also utilized by the enzyme for its activation, as well as inactivation, through specific interactions with proteins containing polyproline and/or phosphotyrosine motifs, thus also allowing specific targeting of the kinases to specific substrates/subcellular compartments (3Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of Src family kinases in various signaling cascades including cytokine receptor pathways (4Corey S.J. Anderson S.M.

While the BCR-Abl fusion protein is the initiating molecule for chromic myeloid leukemia (CML), there is a crucial downstream role for Lyn in BCR-Abl-induced leukemogenesis (23Golas J.M. Arndt K.

Significantly, Imatinib-resistant CML cells have elevated Lyn levels and kinase activity (22Donato N.J. Wu J.Y. Stapley J. Gallick G. Lin H. Arlinghaus R. Talpaz M. Blood. 2003; 101: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Further, ablation of Lyn from Imatinib-resistant CML cells resulted in the induction of apoptosis (30Ptasznik A. Nakata Y. Kalota A. Emerson S.G. Gewirtz A.M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1187-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A significant role for Lyn in the development of certain solid tumors has also come to light. Colon carcinoma cells utilize Lyn in the activation of the Akt anti-apoptotic pathway, and drug-resistant cells show elevated Lyn kinase activity (11Bates R.C. Edwards N.S. Burns G.F. Fisher D.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5275-5283PubMed Google Scholar). Lyn is also involved in the signaling mechanisms regulating prostate cancer cells (31Sumitomo M. Shen R. Walburg M. Dai J. Geng Y. Navarro D.

Significantly, inhibition of Lyn in prostate cancer cell lines resulted in reduced proliferation in vitro and in prostatic cancer xenograft models (10Goldenberg-Furmanov M. Stein I. Pikarsky E.

Thus several lines of evidence point to a significant involvement of Lyn in both leukemic and solid tumor development. The Src-family as well as other cytoplasmic (e.g. Abl) and receptor (e.g. EGF-R) tyrosine kinases are important targets or therapeutic intervention (32Druker B.J. Talpaz M. Resta D.J. Peng B.

To extend our understanding, and provide a structural framework for the design of specific inhibitors to the Src family of kinases, we have determined the crystal structures of the kinase domain of Lyn in complex with 3 different inhibitors, AMP-PNP, 2The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase domain; VDW, van der Waals; DTT, dithiothreitol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. PP2, and Dasatinib, as well as the non-liganded form of the enzyme, at 2.5–2.7-Å resolution. Plasmid Construction—All plasmid constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides and subcloned in-frame into the appropriate vector and confirmed by sequencing. The murine Lyn kinase domain (amino acids 239–512) was subcloned in to the baculovirus expression vector pFastBacHTA (Invitrogen) generating a His6-tagged fusion resulting in a 5-amino acid N-terminal extension (GAMDP) to the Lyn kinase domain after tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage. The murine Csk-binding protein (Cbp, amino acids 74–474) was subcloned into pET44a (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to be expressed as a NusA-His6-tagged fusion in bacteria (Rosetta2, Merck), with replacement of the thrombin with a TEV cleave site using site-directed mutagenesis, for expression and purification using the Profinia system (Bio-Rad) for use as a biologically significant substrate for Lyn kinase assays. Protein Expression and Purification of Lyn Kinase Domain—Recombinant bacmid DNA was isolated and used to transfect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. Baculovirus obtained from the transfection culture was used to infect Sf9 cells grown in suspension to a density of 2 × 106 cells per ml, at a multiplicity of infection greater than 10, and harvested 48 h after infection. Cells were resuspended in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% thesit, supplemented with complete protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Sciences), lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered and loaded onto ProBond nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen). After extensive washing, the recombinant protein was eluted with buffer plus 100–300 mm imidazole and Lyn-containing fractions were pooled. The His6 tag was removed by treatment with TEV protease during overnight dialysis against 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, at 4 °C. The digested protein was bound to a HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with a NaCl gradient. Lyn-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated to 2.5 ml and loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (HiLoad 16/60; GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA. Purified Lyn kinase domain was concentrated to 8 mg/ml for crystallization. Protein Analysis and Western Blotting—Mass spectrometric analysis of purified Lyn protein before and after auto-kinase assays were performed by Proteomics International (East Perth, WA, Australia) on protein gel plugs that were destained, trypsin-digested, and peptides extracted according to standard techniques (39Bringans S. Eriksen S. Kendrick T. Gopalakrishnakone P. Livk A. Lock R. Lipscombe R. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 1081-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Peptides were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/MS) using the Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) coupled to a Q TRAP 4000 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Tryptic peptides were loaded onto a C18PepMap100 reversed phase column (Dionex) and separated with a linear gradient of water/acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (v/v) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Spectra were analyzed to identify proteins of interest using Mascot sequence matching software (Matrix Science, London, UK) with the data base and taxonomy set as Ludwig NR and All Taxonomy, respectively. The phosphorylation detection was achieved with precursor ion scanning for a loss of 79 mass units in negative mode (PO3-) and subsequent MSMS fragmentation of those selected peptides to determine their identity. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Exo-kinase kinase assays were performed essentially as previously described (7Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), with minor modifications, using NusA-Cbp (5 mg/ml) as substrate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, at 30 °C. Kinase inhibitors Dasatinib (Bristol-Myers-Squibb, New York, NY), PP2 (Merck) and SU6656 (Merck) were added to reaction mixtures 10 min prior to the addition of ATP. Auto-kinase reactions were undertaken under identical conditions to those described for the exo-kinase assays, only no NusA-Cbp substrate was added. Reactions contained 0.1 μg/10 μl Lyn kinase and were stopped by the addition of SDS loading buffer. Reactions were then analyzed by Western blotting for phosphotyrosine incorporation into the Cbp substrate. Western blotting was performed essentially as described previously (7Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E.

Antibodies used included anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10-HRP (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and anti-phospho-Src (pY416) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Secondary antibodies were coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were quantitated using a ChemDoc XRS (Bio-Rad) and Quantity One (v4.5.2, Bio-Rad). Crystallization of Lyn Kinase Domain and Formation of Inhibitor Complexes—Crystals were grown at 4 °C using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Purified Lyn kinase domain was mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 23% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1 m Na.Hepes, pH 7.5. Crystals formed after 1–3 days. Inhibitors PP2 (1-tert-butyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4, 5-e]pyrimidin-1-ium-4-amine) and Dasatinib (BMS-354825; N-(2-chloro-6-methylphenyl)-2-(6-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-methylpyrimidin-4-ylamino)thiazole-5-carboxamide) in DMSO at 10 mm, or diluted 10-fold in reservoir solution, were added to drops containing Lyn crystals, and incubated at 4 °C for 1–2 h. AMP-PNP and MgCl2 at 50 mm each were added to crystal-containing drops and incubated for up to 3 weeks at 4 °C. X-Ray Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Crystals were flash-frozen using the reservoir solution plus 10% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Data sets at 2.5–2.76-Å resolution were merged and processed using MOSFLM and SCALA in the CCP4i suite. The crystals, with unit cell dimensions a = b = 127.3 Å and c = 53.8 Å, belong to space group H3, with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The apo-structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program PHASER in the CCP4i suite. Lck was used as a search model (Protein Data Bank ID: 1QPD) with all non-conserved residues substituted with alanine. The structure was refined using the CCP4i suite program REFMAC5 by rigid body fitting followed by restrained refinement interspersed with rounds of model building with the program COOT. For inhibitor complex structures, difference Fourier analyses were used to evaluate ligand binding.

Using an antibody specific for the common activation loop phosphorylation site found in Src family kinases (pTyr416 in Src, pTyr397 in Lyn), only after auto-activation was significant reactivity observed (Fig. 1A). This was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis, showing the purified kinase domain was essentially unphosphorylated at this site, but upon incubation with Mg2+-ATP it became rapidly phosphorylated. The enzyme was also able to rapidly phosphorylate the substrate Cbp in exo-kinase assays showing the capacity of the purified protein to display functional activity (Fig. 1B). Further, the ability of small molecules to inhibit the enzymes ability to phosphorylate Cbp were analyzed, showing Dasatinib (IC50 11 nm), PP2 (IC50 9 nm), and SU6656 (IC50 35 nm) could all strongly inhibit the activity of Lyn (Fig. 1C). The PP2 and Dasatinib inhibitors were then used to examine the structural basis of binding and specificity by x-ray crystallography. Structure of the Lyn Kinase Domain—To determine the overall atomic architecture of the Lyn PTK, and provide a baseline for structural comparison of inhibitor binding to Lyn, the kinase domain of murine Lyn was crystallized in the absence of inhibitor and its structure determined at 2.5-Å resolution and refined to an Rfact = 20.5% and Rfree = 23.8%. The refined model, comprising residues 239–501, is typical of the bi-lobal protein-tyrosine kinase fold and closely resembles the structures of Src, Lck, and Hck (Fig. 2A). Briefly, the N-terminal lobe of the PTK consists of a 5-stranded anti-parallel twisted β-sheet and a single large α-helix, termed the αC helix. The C-terminal lobe is larger and predominantly helical, but includes a 2-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. Between the two lobes is a deep cleft that forms the ATP-binding pocket, and connecting them is a loop that borders the cleft and forms a hinge that confers flexibility to the overall structure, allowing for relative movement of the lobes. The catalytic activity of protein tyrosine kinase can be regulated by the phosphorylation state of the activation loop Tyr residue (Tyr397 in Lyn) and is correlated with movements in the loop and αC. The region of the activation loop spanning this residue is thus highly flexible, and in the apo Lyn structure residues 393–399, inclusive, are disordered and not included in the model, thus not revealing the phosphorylation state of Tyr397, although Western blot and mass spectrometric analyses clearly indicated that the Lyn PTK was unphosphorylated. Structural comparison with unphosphorylated, inactive Src and Hck, and active, phosphorylated Lck (Fig. 2B) shows that despite the lack of phosphorylation in Lyn PTK, the activation loop and αC are in the active conformations. AMP-PNP Binding to Lyn—To provide a model for the substrate-bound state of the enzyme, Lyn crystals were soaked with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue adenyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) in the presence of Mg2+ ions and the resulting complex was solved at 2.7 Å resolution and refined to an Rfact = 19.9% and Rfree = 24.5%. As expected, AMP-PNP binds in the cleft between the two lobes of the kinase domain (Fig. 3A forming extensive van der Waals (VDW) and hydrogen-bonding interactions. The planar adenine ring is sandwiched between the hydrophobic residues of the N-terminal lobe (Leu253, Val261, and Ala273), the hinge region (Phe321 and Met322) and the C-terminal lobe (Leu374). In addition, two hydrogen bonds link the adenine group through N6 and N1 to the hinge residues Glu320O and Met322N, respectively, as seen with AMP-PNP-binding to other Src family kinases. In the published complexes of AMP-PNP with Src (1Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) and Lck (38Zhu X. Kim J.L. Newcomb J.R. Rose P. E, Stover D.R. Toledo L.M. Zhao H. Morgenstern K.A. Structure. 1999; 7: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), the ribose group is hydrogen-bonded to the Ser residue conserved in all but one Src-family PTKs (326 in Lyn) either through a water-mediated hydrogen bond in Src, or directly in the case of Lck where the side chain points toward the ligand. In the Lyn structure, as in Src, Ser326 is pointing away from the ribose group, but at the resolution of this Lyn structure, no hydrogen-bonded water molecule is detected. Asp385 of the conserved DFG motif forms hydrogen bonds with the α- and β-phosphates and a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the imido-nitrogen. The β-phosphate group interacts with the glycine loop residues Ala255 and Gly259 via a water molecule that is accommodated by a small shift in the loop location with respect to the apo structure. A third water molecule links Arg369 to the γ-phosphate. Thus, extensive contacts and hydrogen bonds anchor the substrate analogue and poise the tri-phosphate group for catalysis. PP2 Binding to Lyn—For insight into the structural basis of small molecule inhibition of Lyn PTK by the pan-Src kinase inhibitor PP2, the PP2-Lyn complex was formed by soaking apo Lyn crystals with PP2, and the structure was solved at 2.76-Å resolution and refined to an Rfact = 19.5% and Rfree = 23.1% (Fig. 3B). PP2 binds to Lyn kinase in a very similar position to AMP-PNP, with the respective purine rings almost co-planar. The two adenine group hydrogen bonds to residues Glu320 and Met322 are prese"

Genetic and biochemical evidence has shown that Eaf3 plays an important role in regulating the genomic profile of histone H3 and H4 acetylation, the loss of which leads to increase of H3 and H4 acetylation at coding regions and decrease at promoters, resulting in an even distribution of histone acetylation across the genome (8Reid J.L.

They have been shown to be involved in the recognition and binding of Lys-methylated histone tails and nucleic acids and hence play important roles in histone modification and chromatin remodeling that lead to transcriptional activation or repression of a large number of genes (for reviews, see Refs. 10Berger S.L.

The interaction between the Eaf3 chromo domain and the methylated H3K36 can lead to preferential association of the Rpd3S complex with coding regions, which further mediates preferential histone deacetylation of coding regions. Thus, Eaf3 is ultimately linked to the mechanism by which repressive chromatin structure is restored after transcriptional elongation, because the pattern of H3K36 methylation is determined by the pattern of phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (5Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T. Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L.

However, the Eaf3 chromo domain and H3K36 methylation do not significantly affect acetylation at promoters, suggesting that Eaf3-dependent effects at promoters and coding regions are mechanistically distinct. Since Eaf3 positively regulates histone acetylation at promoters, it seems likely that this function of Eaf3 might rely on preferential association of the NuA4 HAT complex with promoters through an unknown mechanism (8Reid J.L. Moqtaderi Z. Struhl K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Joshi A.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 971-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). No matter how, the existence of Eaf3 in both Rpd3S HDAC and NuA4 HAT complexes, in particular the interaction of the Eaf3 chromo domain with methylated H3K36, provides a vehicle to coordinately or independently regulate the global patterns of histone acetylation at promoters and coding regions throughout the genome. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the Eaf3 chromo domain can recognize and bind to methylated H3K36 and how the Rpd3S and NuA4 complexes can distinguish specific chromatin sites. Eaf3 belongs to the MRG protein family, whose members are highly conserved from Arabidopsis thaliana to humans (21Bertram M.J. Pereira-Smith O.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Like Eaf3, the other members of the MORF4-related gene (MRG) protein family are also components of HAT and/or HDAC complexes and are involved in histone modification. The human homolog MRG15 is a component of the Tip60 HAT complex (22Doyon Y. Selleck W. Lane W.S. Tan S. Cote J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1884-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). It plays a vital role in embryonic development and cell proliferation, and the knock-out mouse shows a decreased level of acetylation in both histone H3 and H4 (23Tominaga K. Kirtane B. Jackson J.G. Ikeno Y. Ikeda T. Hawks C. Smith J.R. Matzuk M.M. Pereira-Smith O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2924-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MRG15 contains a chromo barrel domain at the N terminus, which can bind methylated H3K36 in a way different from that of the HP1/Pc chromo domain (20Zhang P. Du J. Sun B. Dong X. Xu G. Zhou J. Huang Q. Liu Q. Hao Q. Ding J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6621-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Another human homolog, MORF4, which lacks the chromo domain, can induce cellular senescence in immortal cell lines (24Bertram M.J. Berube N.G. Hang-Swanson X. Ran Q. Leung J.K. Bryce S. Spurgers K. Bick R.J. Baldini A. Ning Y. Clark L.J. Parkinson E.K. Barrett J.C. Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1479-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Both MRG15 and MORF4 associate with mSin3A complexes (25Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7868-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The C. elegans homolog MRG1 is required for establishing the ability of primordial germ cells to initiate mitotic proliferation during postembryonic development (26Fujita M. Takasaki T. Nakajima N. Kawano T. Shimura Y. Sakamoto H. Mech. Dev. 2002; 114: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Drosophila homolog MSL3 (male-specific lethal protein 3) is essential for the dosage compensation of X-linked genes in males and is critical for the activation of the HAT activity of dMOF (6Eisen A.

Furthermore, male-specific lethal can attract the male-specific lethal complex to open reading frames marked with trimethylated H3K36 in a sequence-independent manner (30Larschan E. Alekseyenko A.A.

The Saccharomyces pombe homolog Alp13 (altered polarity protein 13) is a component of the Clr6 HDAC complex and affects the histone acetylation level in the fission yeast (31Nakayama J. Xiao G. Noma K. Malikzay A. Bjerling P. Ekwall K. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2776-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that these MRG proteins might also function through interactions with methylated histones in the HAT and HDAC complexes and participate in the modification and regulation of the histone acetylation pattern. To understand the molecular basis of the function of the Eaf3 chromo domain and its binding with the methylated histone tail, we determined the crystal structures of the Eaf3 chromo domain in two truncation forms and characterized its interactions with the methylated H3K36 peptides. The Eaf3 chromo domain is more similar to the autoinhibited chromo barrel domain of human MRG15 than the typical HP1 chromo domain. Compared with the other chromo domains, the Eaf3 chromo domain contains a 38-residue insertion that forms part of the extended β-barrel. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis results indicate that the Eaf3 chromo domain can bind to methylated H3K36 peptide with a KD of about 10-4 m. NMR titration studies demonstrate that the methylated H3K36 peptide is bound in the cleft formed by the C-terminal α-helix and the β-barrel core. As in the other chromo domain structures, four conserved aromatic residues, Tyr-23, Tyr-81, Trp-84, and Trp-88, form a hydrophobic pocket at one end of the β-barrel core and are essential for the binding of the methylated H3K36, as revealed by site-directed mutagenesis studies and in vitro binding assays. During revision of this paper, a solution structure of the Eaf3 chromo domain (equivalent to the short form Eaf3 chromo domain reported here) with a covalently linked methylated H3K36 peptide was published online (32Xu C. Cui G. Botuyan M.V. Mer G. Structure. 2008; 16: 1740-1750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This solution structure is very similar to the crystal structures reported here, and their structural results are consistent with our structural and binding data. Protein Expression and Purification and Peptide Synthesis—Two truncation forms of the Eaf3 chromo domain (corresponding to residues 1–113 (short form) and residues 1–124 (long form), respectively) were amplified using PCR from S. cerevisiae genome DNA. The plasmid pET-22b (+) containing the recombinant Eaf3 chromo domain gene fused with a His6 tag at the C terminus between the NdeI and XhoI sites was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain. The bacterial cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 of 0.6, and protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 16 °C for 20 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × g, suspended in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed on ice by sonication. Cell debris was precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatant was used for protein purification. The Eaf3 chromo domain was purified by affinity chromatography using an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen) equilibrated with a binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl). The column was washed with the binding buffer plus 30 mm imidazole to remove nonspecific binding proteins. The target protein was eluted with the binding buffer plus 300 mm imidazole. The protein sample was further purified by gel filtration using Superdex G75 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) and then concentrated to 20 mg/ml for crystallization and biochemical studies. Mutations of the Eaf3 chromo domain were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Expression and purification of the mutant proteins followed the same procedures as for the wild-type protein. The yeast methylated H3K36me2/3 (residues 28–44), unmethylated H3K36 (residues 28–44), and methylated H3K9me3 (residues 1–15) peptides were synthesized by HD Biosciences (Shanghai, China). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Analysis—Thermodynamic parameters of both short form and long form Eaf3 chromo domain for binding the histone H3 peptides were determined by ITC at 25 °C using a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA) (33Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). The protein sample was dialyzed against an assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl), and the lyophilized peptides were dissolved in the same buffer. The exothermic heat of the reaction was measured by 30 sequential injections of the peptide (1.5 mm), each 10 μl, into 1.41 ml of the protein solution (0.1 mm) with spacing intervals of 150 s. The heat of dilution was obtained by injecting a ligand into the same buffer and was subtracted from the head of the reaction before the fitting process. Binding curves were analyzed by nonlinear least squares fitting of the data using Microcal ORIGIN software. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Analysis—SPR experiments were also performed to measure the binding affinity of both short form and long form Eaf3 chromo domain with the H3K36me3 peptide using ProteOn XPR36 (Bio-Rad) at 25 °C. The Eaf3 chromo domain was first immobilized on a GLC chip at a similar level (∼2000 response units), and the H3K36me3 peptide was used as analytes for binding. The association was monitored over a 90-s period, during which the peptide in the running buffer (PBST, pH 7.4) was flown over the immobilized protein at 100 μl/min. The dissociation was monitored by flowing PBST over the subsequent 600 s. The surface was regenerated with 10 mm NaOH. An irrelevant protein (interleukin-2 antibody) was used as a blank reference. KD values were computed by equilibrium analysis using Bio-Rad ProteOn Manager 2.0.1 software. In Vitro Binding Assay—In vitro binding assays were carried out to explore the binding site of the short form Eaf3 chromo domain with the H3K36me2 peptide, using the method described previously (20Zhang P. Du J. Sun B. Dong X. Xu G. Zhou J. Huang Q. Liu Q. Hao Q. Ding J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6621-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A His6 tag was fused with both wild-type and mutant Eaf3 chromo domain. 20 μg of the protein was first incubated with 100 μl of 25% Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow bead slurry (Qiagen) for 1 h. After removal of the solution, the beads were mixed with 100 μg of the bovine serum albumin protein and 15 μg of the H3K36me2 peptide (protein/peptide molar ratio of 1:3) in 1 ml of a binding buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After extensive washing with the binding buffer, the protein with bound peptide was visualized by peptide dot blot analysis. The Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow beads were eluted with 30 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 300 mm imidazole. 2.0 μl of the elution sample was spotted onto nitrocellular membrane and probed with anti-H3K36me2 antibody (dilution 1:2000; Upstate Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:2000; Chemicon) and ECL-advance Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences) were used for exposure detection. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Crystallization was performed using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of the short form Eaf3 chromo domain were grown at 4 °C in a drop with an equal volume of the protein solution (20 mg/ml) and the reservoir solution (100 mm MES, pH 6.0, and 30% polyethylene glycol 6000). Crystals of the long form Eaf3 chromo domain were grown at 4 °C in a drop with an equal volume of the protein solution (10 mg/ml) and the reservoir solution (100 mm Bicine, pH 9.0, 2.4 m ammonium sulfate, and 4% acetone). Diffraction data were collected at Photo Factory BL-6A and BL-17A from flash-cooled crystals at 100 K. The diffraction data were processed, integrated, and scaled together with HKL2000 (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar).

Huang Q. Liu Q. Hao Q. Ding J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6621-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The program ARP/WARP was used to build an initial model, followed by manual building with the programs O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) and Coot (37Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar). The structure of the long form Eaf3 chromo domain was solved by molecular replacement with the short form Eaf3 chromo domain as the search model. Structure refinement was carried out using the programs CNS and REFMAC5 (38Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar). The statistics of the structure refinement and the quality of the final structure model are summarized in Table 1. NMR Spectroscopy Analysis—All NMR data were collected on a Varian Unity Inova 600 MHz spectrometer at 298 K. The samples used in the experiments contain 0.5–1.0 mm 15N/15N,13C-labeled protein in a buffer consisting of 20 mm phosphate, pH 6.6, and 0.1 m NaCl with 10% D2O. Sequential assignments of the Eaf3 chromo domain were accomplished using three-dimensional sensitivity-enhanced HNCACB and CBCA-(CO)NH experiments. All of the spectra were processed with the NMRPipe software (39Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the Sparky software (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco). Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were used to monitor the chemical shift changes of the Eaf3 chromo domain upon the binding of the H3K36me3 peptide. A series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded with the use of increasing concentrations of the peptide until the molar ratio of protein to peptide reached 1:10. For analysis of the chemical shift perturbations of 1H and 15N backbone resonance, the average chemical shift changes were calculated using the following formula. δave=ΔδHN2+ΔδN2/25(Eq. 1) A significant chemical shift change was defined as a value larger than the average plus the S.D. The residues with significant chemical shift change are thought to be involved in interaction with the peptide. Structure of the Eaf3 Chromo Domain—The structure of the short form Eaf3 chromo domain (residues 1–113) was solved by molecular replacement, and the structure refinement converged to an R factor of 18.8% and a free R factor of 21.7% at 1.8 Å resolution (Table 1). This crystal form belongs to space group C2221 and contains one Eaf3 chromo domain molecule in the asymmetric unit. In the final model, the N-terminal six residues (numbered 1–6) and residues 44–53 were disordered. The Eaf3 chromo domain is composed of an extended, twisted β-barrel and a C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 1A). A number of hydrophobic residues (including Phe-8, Tyr-77, Ile-79, Val-92, and Ile-97) form a hydrophobic core to stabilize the overall scaffold. The C-terminal α-helix flanks one side of the β-barrel and is in the opposite direction from that of the HP1/Pc chromo domains. Residues Ile-105, Met-107, and Leu-111 of the α-helix have hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Leu-15 and Phe-17 of β1, Leu-21 and Met-22 of β2, and Arg-98 of β5. The side chain Nδ2 of Asn-109 forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of Ala-99. These interactions dictate the orientation of the C-terminal α-helix, which is important for the binding of histone peptide (see below). Recently, the NMR solution structure of the MRG15 chromo domain was released by the Protein Data Bank (code 2EFI), in which the C-terminal region forms two short α-helices connected by three residues rather than one long α-helix, as seen in the crystal structure, and the C-terminal short α-helix makes a sharp bend and folds onto t"
https://openalex.org/W1965525706,"It is well documented that dopamine can increase or decrease the activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA, sodium pump) in an organ-specific fashion. This regulation can occur, at least partially, via receptor-mediated second messenger activation and can promote NKA insertion or removal from the plasma membrane. Using co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we now show that, in both brain and HEK293T cells, D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (DARs) can exist in a complex with the sodium pump. To determine the impact of NKA on DAR function, biological assays were conducted with NKA and DARs co-expressed in HEK293T cells. In this system, expression of NKA dramatically decreased D1 and D2 DAR densities with a concomitant functional decrease in DAR-mediated regulation of cAMP levels. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of endogenous or overexpressed NKA enhanced DAR function without altering receptor number or localization. Similarly, DAR function was also augmented by small interfering RNA reduction of the endogenous NKA. These data suggest that, under basal conditions, NKA negatively regulates DAR function via protein-protein interactions. In reciprocal fashion, expression of DARs decreases endogenous NKA function in the absence of dopamine, implicating DAR proteins as regulators of NKA activity. Notably, dopamine stimulation or pertussis toxin inhibition of D2 receptor signaling did not alter NKA activity, indicating that the D2-mediated decrease in NKA function is dependent upon protein-protein interactions rather than signaling molecules. This evidence for reciprocal regulation between DARs and NKA provides a novel control mechanism for both DAR signaling and cellular ion balance.

DARs are subdivided into two families based on their pharmacological and genetic profiles. The D1 family of receptors, containing the D1 and D5 subtypes, couple to the heterotrimeric G-protein Gs and positively regulate adenylyl cyclase activity. The D2 family of DARs consists of the D2,D3, and D4 receptor subtypes. These receptors couple to inhibitory Gi/o proteins and reduce adenylyl cyclase activity. Within the central nervous system, dopamine and its receptors regulate locomotion, addiction, cognition, and learning and memory formation (1El-Ghundi M. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Rev.

Dysregulation of dopaminergic pathways and receptors has been implicated in several diseases, including schizophrenia, Parkinson disease, and hypertension.

Identification of the numerous protein partners in the signalplex is critical to understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for tissue-specific dopamine functions and various dopaminergic disorders. Several dopamine receptor-interacting proteins (DRIPs) have recently been discovered (10Kabbani N. Levenson R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 572: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Bergson C. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Lidow M.S. Trends Pharmacol.

These identified DRIPs regulate a variety of functions, including cell signaling and receptor trafficking and retention. Using co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectroscopy analysis, we have now identified the α1 subunit of the Na+,K+-ATPase (sodium pump, NKA) as a DRIP in both D1 and D2 DAR signalplexes. The NKA is a ubiquitous membrane protein that actively hydrolyzes ATP to maintain the Na+/K+ gradient across the plasma membrane. The NKA consists of a large, catalytic α subunit and a smaller β subunit. The α1 subunit is expressed in virtually all tissues, including neurons and glia in the central nervous system (13Moseley A.E. Williams M.T. Schaefer T.L. Bohanan C.S. Neumann J.C. Behbehani M.M. Vorhees C.V. Lingrel J.B J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Neuronally, the NKA is responsible for maintenance of resting membrane potential, including restoration of membrane potential following depolarization (14Dobretsov M. Stimers J.R. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 2373-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Several investigators have demonstrated dopaminergic control of the NKA in primary striatal, lung, and kidney cells (15Barnard M.L. Olivera W.G. Rutschman D.M. Bertorello A.M. Katz A.I. Sznajder J.I.

However, in all of these studies, dopamine and other neurotransmitter receptor agonists appeared to regulate the NKA via signal transduction pathways; second messenger kinases and downstream signaling caused insertion or removal of the NKA at the plasma membrane (15Barnard M.L.

Furthermore, we show that the DARs and NKA are able to functionally regulate one another via protein-protein interactions in the absence of ligands or downstream signaling events. Our results indicate that, in addition to traditional second messenger-mediated communication, the DARs and NKA can associate in a complex to provide a more rapid and immediate response to external stimuli or changing the cellular environment.

Immunoprecipitation and Gel Electrophoresis—For HEK293T cells, cells were removed from culture flasks in calcium-free Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) and collected by centrifugation (200 × g). Pelleted cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate) with Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble cell debris and then pre-cleared via incubation with protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) for 3 h. The agarose was removed by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 5 min) and discarded. Anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) was added and incubated with the lysate overnight at 4 °C. The beads were collected via centrifugation and washed three times via resuspension and re-pelleting in solubilization buffer (7,000 × g, 5 min). The agarose was then washed twice in 1× TE buffer, pH 7.4. Proteins were eluted from the beads using NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. Agarose was removed via centrifugation, and proteins were separated on 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For bovine corpus striatum, diced striatum was Polytron-homogenized for ∼1 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl + 1% CHAPS, pH 7.5, with Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets and then incubated on ice for 1 h. Solubilized striatum was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble cell debris; the resulting supernatant was centrifuged for an additional 30 min (30,000 × g). The supernatant was then pre-cleared via incubation with protein G-agarose for 3 h at 4 °C; agarose was removed by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 5 min) and discarded. Protein concentrations of the sample supernatants were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Cell lysate (500 μg), anti-D2S/L antibody (4 μg), and Antibody Capture Affinity ligand were added according to the manufacturer's instructions to washed Catch and Release kit beads (Pierce) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with Catch and Release kit buffer, 3× with Tris-HCl/CHAPS, and an additional three times with Catch and Release kit buffer. Proteins were eluted from beads according to the manufacturer's instructions, heated at 37 °C for 1 h, and separated on 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gel. Western Blotting and Gel Staining—Proteins separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in Superblock (Pierce) prior to incubation with the primary antibody. Primary antibodies used in this study include the following: rat monoclonal anti-D1 dopamine receptor (clone 1-1-F11 S.E6, catalogue number D187, Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-D2S/L (catalogue number AB5084P, Chemicon Millipore, Billerica, MA), and mouse monoclonal anti-NKAα1 (clone C464.6, catalogue number 05-369, Upstate Millipore, Billerica, MA). After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; anti-rat for the D1, anti-rabbit for D2, and anti-mouse for NKAα1). Proteins were visualized via the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and images were recorded on film or computer using the UVP Bioimaging Systems EpiChemi3 Darkroom (UVP, Upland, CA). In some experiments, blots were stripped of all antibody using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Removal of all primary antibody by the buffer was checked via incubation with HRP-secondary followed by ECL and film exposure. In experiments where total protein was examined, gels were stained using colloidal Coomassie SimplyBlue Safe Stain (Invitrogen). Mass Spectrometry (MS)—The identification of PAGE-resolved proteins by mass spectroscopy was carried out by Prot-Tech, Inc. (Norristown, PA). In brief, each protein gel band was digested “in-gel” with modified sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI), and the resulting peptide mixture was subjected to tandem mass spectrometry for peptide sequencing. A Finnigan ion trap mass spectrometer LCQ coupled with a high performance liquid chromatography system running a 75 μm inner diameter C18 column was used. Data were acquired in a data-dependent mode. MS/MS spectra were used to search the most recent nonredundant protein data bases including the Protein Information Resources database and GenBank™ using ProtQuest software suite from ProtTech. The output of the data base search was manually analyzed and validated to verify proper protein identification. Confocal Microscopy—HEK293T cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (1 × 106 cells) and transfected as described above with 1 μg of rat D2L-RFP or 0.5 μg of rat NKAα1-eGFP, either separately or co-transfected with both constructs for dual-labeling experiments. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were re-seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes and maintained for an additional 48 h. Confocal microscopy experiments were performed on a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 5 Pascal). Images were collected using single line excitation (488 nm for NKAα1-eGFP or 543 nm for D2L-RFP). Membrane Radioligand Binding Assays—HEK293T cells were plated in 150-mm tissue culture dishes (5 × 106 cells) and transfected as described above. Forty eight hours later, the cells were removed mechanically using EBSS. For experiments involving ouabain treatment, a final concentration of 5 mm ouabain was added to cells, and dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min prior to removal. Intact cells were pelleted and then lysed with 5 mm Tris-HCl and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. Homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The membranes were resuspended with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Membrane preparations were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with various concentrations of [3H]SCH23390 (D1 binding) or [3H]methylspiperone (D2 binding) in a reaction volume of 1 ml. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 4 μm (+)-butaclamol. Bound ligand was separated from unbound by filtration through polyethyleneimine-soaked GF/C filters using a Brandel cell harvester. GF/C filter disks were then analyzed via liquid scintillation spectroscopy at a counting efficiency of 60%. Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). cAMP Accumulation Assays—Transfected HEK293T cells were seeded into 24-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates at 200,000 cells/well and cultured for 1 day prior to the experiment. For D1 accumulation assays, cells were washed three times with 400 μl of EBSS per well. Various concentrations of dopamine dissolved in stimulation buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 μm Ro-20-1724, 0.2 mm sodium metabisulfite) were added to each well in a volume of 400 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. For D2 inhibition assays, cells were washed three times with 400 μl of EBSS per well. Various concentrations of dopamine containing 3 μm forskolin and 10 μm propranolol in stimulation buffer were added to each well in a volume of 400 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. For experiments involving ouabain treatment, stimulation buffer (for either D1 or D2L experiments) was prepared with or without 5 mm ouabain. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in the ouabain or control stimulation buffer prior to dopamine addition. Dopamine solutions were prepared in appropriate stimulation buffer for the experiment. The reactions were terminated by adding 200 μl of 3% perchloric acid and incubated on ice for 30 min. 80 μl of 15% KHCO3 was then added to neutralize the acid. The plates remained on ice for an additional 20 min and were centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 20 min. 50 μl of the supernatant from each well was transferred to a 1.2-ml reaction tube containing 250 μl of purified cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in Tris/EDTA buffer and 50 μl of [3H]cAMP. The reaction was incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. After the incubation, 250 μl of 1% charcoal-dextran mixture was added to each tube and vortexed gently. Tubes were then incubated at 4 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation (1,300 × g) for 20 min. Radioactivity in the supernatant was quantified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy at a counting efficiency of 60%. cAMP concentrations were determined using a standard assay curve of cAMP values from 0.1 to 100 pmol. Intact Cell Binding Assays—Transfected HEK293T cells were seeded into poly(D)-lysine-coated 24-well plates at 200,000 cells/well. Twenty four hours later, cells were washed once with EBSS, and binding was performed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C in 500 μl of EBSS containing increasing concentrations of [3H]sulpiride with or without 5 mm ouabain. After incubation, the binding buffer was aspirated, and the plates were washed three times with EBSS. The cells were dissolved in 500 μl of 1 mm EDTA containing 1% Triton X-100, transferred to vials, and quantified for radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectroscopy at a counting efficiency of 60%. Specific binding was defined as the difference between total and nonspecific binding, with the latter measured in the presence of 5 μm (+)-butaclamol. Rubidium-86 Ion Uptake—HEK293T cells were plated in 150-mm tissue culture dish (5 × 106 cells) and transfected as described above. Forty eight hours later the cells were removed mechanically using EBSS. Intact cells were pelleted and then resuspended in 1.5 ml of assay buffer (5 mm HEPES-Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose; 0.1 mm furosemide and 0.01 mm monensin were added just prior to experimentation) with or without 5 mm ouabain. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in assay buffer alone, then 2.5 μCi of 86Rb+ in assay buffer was added, and samples were incubated for an additional 15 min at 37 °C. Uptake was terminated by addition of 500 μl of ice-cold 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm MgCl2 followed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g. Pellets were washed a total of three times with HEPES/MgCl2, and cells were then lysed with 500 μl of NaOH and neutralized with 50 μl of concentrated HCl. Radioactivity was analyzed via liquid scintillation spectroscopy at a counting efficiency of 60%. Protein concentration was determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Identification of the NKA as an Interacting Protein with Both D1 and D2 DARs—As part of ongoing efforts in DRIP discovery, co-immunoprecipitation assays of epitope-tagged rat D2L receptors were coupled with MS analysis to identify D2 DAR-interacting proteins. For these experiments, HEK293T cells (which do not endogenously express the D2 DAR) were transiently transfected with constructs expressing either a FLAG peptide (FLAG tag) alone or a FLAG-D2L receptor. Proteins from solubilized cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Staining with colloidal Coomassie Blue dye revealed multiple proteins that were precipitated from both transfection conditions (Fig. 1). All visible protein bands from the FLAG-D2L lane (Fig. 1, right lane) were excised, along with corresponding control bands (FLAG tag, Fig. 1, left lane) for comparison and selection purposes. The excised bands were digested with trypsin, and the eluted proteins were subjected to liquid chromatography-MS/MS tandem mass spectroscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures”; all identified proteins from this experiment are listed in Table 1. Proteins that were identified in both sets of immunoprecipitates were considered nonspecific interactors; no identified proteins were unique to the FLAG tag control immunoprecipitates. The NKA was identified in these experiments as a specific interacting protein with the FLAG-tagged rat D2L receptor and was chosen for further study. Similar liquid chromatography-MS/MS experiments that were conducted with the FLAG-D1 receptor revealed the NKA as a putative specific interacting protein with this receptor as well (29Free R.B.

Multiple nonoverlapping peptide fragments from both the D2L protein (Fig. 1, Band 13) and the NKA protein (Fig. 1, Band 3) were identified from the FLAG-D2L receptor bands; the sequence of these peptides is reported in Table 2. These proteins were absent from the corresponding control FLAG tag lanes (Fig. 1). The same NKA peptides, and three additional peptide fragments from the NKA, were identified from FLAG-D1 receptor immunoprecipitated samples. These peptides, as well as identified D1 receptor peptide sequences, are listed in Table 2.TABLE 1Proteins identified by mass spectroscopy that co-immunoprecipitated with the D2 dopamine receptor as shown in Fig. 1 Accession numbers for identified proteins are reported in parentheses.Specific rat D2L interactorsNonspecific interactorsCellular apoptosis susceptibility protein (AAC35008)26 S proteasome regulatory subunit 2 (BAG10963)Ca2+-ATPase (EAW97905)Proteasome 26 S subunit 13 (NP_787128)PUM2 protein (AAH24218)IgG light chain (ABV55856)Monocarboxylic acid transporter 1 (CAI21873)Ubiquitin B (EAX04505)MCM10 protein (AAH04876)Dopamine D2 receptor (NP_036679)HSPC121 protein (AAF29085)Zinc finger protein 491 (NP_689569)SLC44A2 protein (AAH10617)Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit (ABW03450)Calumenin (AAB97725)Kinesin family member 11 (BAD92201) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Peptides and corresponding parent proteins found in co-immunoprecipitation mass spectroscopy experimentsHEK293T transfectionBand no.aBand number refers to location of band on Coomassie-stained gel in Fig. 1Trypsin-digested peptideParent proteinFLAG-D23VDNSSLTGESEPQTR, LNIPVSQVNPRNa+,K+-ATPase13QNWSRPFNGSEGK, YTAVAMPMLYNTRD2 DARFLAG-D1VDNSSLTGESEPQTR, LSLDELHRNa+,K+-ATPase LNIPVSQVNPR, SPDFTNENPLETR GVGIISEGNETVEDIAAREEAGGIAKPLEKD1 DAR LSPALSVILDYDTDVSLEK IQPVTHSGQHST, YWAISSPFQYERa Band number refers to location of band on Coomassie-stained gel in Fig. 1 Open table in a new tab Verification and Characterization of DAR Interactions with NKAα1—To verify the mass spectroscopy results, the DAR-NKA interactions were investigated by co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis.

Probing the Western blots with an anti-D1 receptor antibody showed that the D1 receptor was present only in cells that were transfected with the FLAG-D1 expression construct (Fig. 2A, left panel). Interestingly, overexpression of NKAα1 caused an apparent decrease in D1 receptor number (Fig. 2A, left panel, ∼50 kDa in size). The Western blot in Fig. 2A was stripped and re-probed with an antibody against NKAα1 (Fig. 2A, right panel, migrating at ∼95 kDa in size), revealing that endogenous NKAα1 only immunoprecipitates with the D1 receptor and not with the FLAG tag alone.

https://openalex.org/W1973886765,"We studied whether K+-Cl- cotransporters (KCCs) are involved in gastric HCl secretion. We found that KCC4 is expressed in the gastric parietal cells more abundantly at the luminal region of the gland than at the basal region. KCC4 was found in the stimulation-associated vesicles (SAV) derived from the apical canalicular membrane but not in the intracellular tubulovesicles, whereas H+,K+-ATPase was expressed in both of them. In contrast, KCC1, KCC2, and KCC3 were not found in either SAV or tubulovesicles. KCC4 coimmunoprecipitated with H+,K+-ATPase in the lysate of SAV. Interestingly the MgATP-dependent uptake of 36Cl- into the SAV was suppressed by either the H+,K+-ATPase inhibitor (SCH28080) or the KCC inhibitor ((R)-(+)-[(2-n-butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-1-oxo-1H-inden-5-yl)oxy]acetic acid). The KCC inhibitor suppressed the H+ uptake into SAV and the H+,K+-ATPase activity of SAV, but the inhibitor had no effects on these activities in the freeze-dried leaky SAV. These results indicate that the K+-Cl- cotransport by KCC4 is tightly coupled with H+/K+ antiport by H+,K+-ATPase, resulting in HCl accumulation in SAV. In the tetracycline-regulated expression system of KCC4 in the HEK293 cells stably expressing gastric H+,K+-ATPase, KCC4 was coimmunoprecipitated with H+,K+-ATPase. The rate of recovery of intracellular pH in the KCC4-expressing cells after acid loading through an ammonium pulse was significantly faster than that in the KCC4-non-expressing cells. Our results suggest that KCC4 and H+,K+-ATPase are the main machineries for basal HCl secretion in the apical canalicular membrane of the resting parietal cell. They also may contribute in part to massive acid secretion in the stimulated state. We studied whether K+-Cl- cotransporters (KCCs) are involved in gastric HCl secretion.

Although the intracellular Cl- concentration of the parietal cell has not been reported, it is speculated to be much lower than that of the luminal secreted HCl (160 mm). Thus, Cl- transport through Cl- channels would require a large electrical potential difference across the apical membrane (e.g. 60 mV, inside negative against the luminal side). But to date the reports of this electrical potential differences have been low, such as 20-25 mV (9Demarest J.R. Loo D.D.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), hinting that the Cl- secretory mechanism may be more complex than previously assumed.Electroneutral K+-Cl- cotransporters (KCCs) belong to a cation-chloride cotransporter gene family (SLC12). KCCs contribute to transepithelial transport and to the regulation of cell volume (10Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. Cell Physiol.

Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). At least four KCC isoforms (KCC1-KCC4) have been identified to date. KCC3 has three splicing variants: KCC3a-KCC3c. KCC1 is widely expressed, whereas KCC2 is restricted to neurons. KCC3a and KCC4 are mainly expressed in epithelial-type cells (13Mount D.B. Mercado A. Song L. Xu J. George Jr., A.L. Delpire E.

Recently we found that KCC3a is expressed in the basolateral membrane of gastric parietal cells located at the luminal region of gastric glands and coimmunoprecipitated with Na+,K+-ATPase (15Fujii T.

So far, there have been no reports describing the presence of any KCCs in the luminal membrane. In the present study, we found that KCC4 is predominantly expressed and associated with H+,K+-ATPase in the apical canalicular membrane of gastric parietal cells and that KCC4 is an important molecule for maintaining H+,K+-ATPase activity in the canalicular membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Anti-human KCC4 rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptides against 16 amino acids corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of KCC4 (DEESRRREAKAPRMGC).

The cell suspension rich in parietal cells was prepared from isolated rabbit gastric mucosa as described previously (17Sakai H. Ohira Y. Tanaka A. Suzuki T. Ikari A. Morii M. Takeguchi N. J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Hog gastric mucosa was prepared from the stomach obtained from Toyama meat center (Toyama, Japan). Human gastric mucosa was obtained from surgical resection of Japanese patients at Toyama University Hospital in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and with ethics committee approval. All of the patients gave informed consent.Preparation of Hog Gastric Vesicles (Stimulation-associated Vesicles (SAV) and Tubulovesicles (TV))—Two kinds of gastric vesicles (heavy and light vesicles) were prepared simultaneously from hog gastric mucosa as described previously (18Asano S. Iino T. Tabuchi Y. Takeguchi N. J. Biochem. 1988; 103: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly the fundic region of the mucosa was scraped and homogenized in 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 13,500 × g for 30 min. The pellet, resuspended in the buffer solution, was applied to the top of a 7% Ficoll shelf on a 12% Ficoll step gradient and centrifuged in an RPV-50T rotor (Hitachi Koki Co., Tokyo, Japan) at 132,000 × g for 1 h. Heavy vesicles were collected from the interface between the 7 and 12% Ficoll layers, and they were washed with 250 mm sucrose to remove the Ficoll. Then the sample was centrifuged at 120,000 × g in an SW41 Ti rotor (Beckman) for 20 h laying on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (10, 20, 30, and 50% sucrose), and 10 fractions of 1 ml each were collected from the top of the gradient. Fraction 5 was used as the SAV that contained the apical canalicular membranes of parietal cells (rich in H+,K+-ATPase and least contaminated with Na+,K+-ATPase) (supplemental Fig. 1). On the other hand, the supernatant after 13,500 × g centrifugation was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The samples were then applied to a 250 mm sucrose and 7% Ficoll step gradient and centrifuged at 132,000 × g for 1 h. Light (microsomal) vesicles were collected from the interface between the 250 mm sucrose and 7% Ficoll layers, and the sample was used as the TV that contained the intracellular microsomal membranes of parietal cells. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. When indicated, freeze-dried SAV and TV were prepared by lyophilization, which increased leakiness of the vesicular membranes.Northern Blotting—Poly(A)+ RNA of the cells was prepared by using PolyATtract mRNA isolation system II (Promega, Madison, WI), and 2.5 μg of it was separated on a 1% agarose, formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Zeta-probe GT, Bio-Rad). Northern blotting was performed as described previously (15Fujii T. Takahashi Y. Itomi Y. Fujita K. Morii M. Tabuchi Y. Asano S. Tsukada K. Takeguchi N. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6869-6877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using the 32P-labeled rabbit KCC4 probe that is 713 bp long and corresponds to nucleotides 682-1394 of the KCC4 cDNA.Western Blotting—Preparation of membrane fractions and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (19Sakai H. Suzuki T. Maeda M. Takahashi Y. Horikawa N. Minamimura T. Tsukada K. Takeguchi N. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The signals were visualized with the ECL Plus system (GE Healthcare). To quantify the chemiluminescence signals on the membranes, a FujiFilm LAS-1000 system and MultiGauge software were used. Anti-H+,K+-ATPase antibodies were used at 1:5,000 (1H9 and 2B6) or 1:4,000 dilution (Ab1024). Anti-KCC1, anti-KCC2, anti-KCC3, anti-KCC4, and anti-β-actin antibodies were used at 1:1,000 dilution. Anti-Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit antibody was used at 1:10,000 dilution. Anti-Xpress antibody was used at 1:5,000 dilution. Anti-ezrin and anti-syntaxin-1 antibodies were used at 1:500 dilution. Anti-Rab11 antibody was used at 1:200 dilution. For the negative control, 1 volume of each primary antibody was preincubated with 5 volumes of the corresponding blocking peptide. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat IgG was used as a secondary antibody (1:2,500 dilution).Immunohistochemistry—The gastric mucosa isolated from rat stomach was embedded in the optimum cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan) and was cut at 8 μm. The sections were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 7 min at room temperature and were pretreated with 1.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding of antibody. Then the sections were incubated with anti-mouse KCC4, anti-H+,K+-ATPase (1H9), anti-Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit, or anti-AQP4 antibody (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (1:100 dilution) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescence images were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope.Immunocytochemistry—HEK293 cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 7 min at room temperature and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 3% bovine serum albumin. The permeabilized cells were incubated with the anti-mouse KCC4 or anti-H+,K+-ATPase (1H9) antibody (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 °C and then with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescence images were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope.Immunoprecipitation—Membrane fractions of SAV (100 μg of protein) and the HEK293 cells stably expressing both KCC4 and H+,K+-ATPase (2 mg of protein) were solubilized in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EDTA) for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was precleared with protein A-agarose beads, and the supernatant was incubated in the presence and absence of anti-KCC4 antibody (1:50 dilution) or anti-His tag antibody (1:100 dilution) for 12 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Antibody-antigen complexes were incubated with protein A-agarose beads and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Then the beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and suspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were used for Western blotting to check the expression of KCC4, H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, or β-actin.Measurement of 36Cl- Uptake into Hog Gastric Vesicles (SAV and TV)—SAV or TV (100 μg of protein) were preincubated with a solution of 150 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 40 mm PIPES-Tris (pH 6.8) for 5 min or 20 h at 4 °C. Then the vesicle (SAV or TV) was incubated with a solution containing 150 mm KCl, 4 mm MgSO4, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm ATP, 5 μCi/ml Na36Cl, and 40 mm PIPES-Tris (pH 6.8) for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction mixtures were rapidly filtered through a 0.45-μm HAWP filter (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). To calibrate nonspecific binding of Na36Cl to the vesicles and the filter, the experiment was performed in the absence of ATP. The filter was washed with solution containing 150 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 40 mm PIPES-Tris (pH 6.8); transferred to a counting vial; and solubilized with 5 ml of ACS II scintillant. Then the radioactivity of 36Cl- was countered.Measurement of H+ Uptake into SAV and TV—H+ uptake into hog gastric vesicles was assessed by measuring the quenching of acridine orange fluorescence (20Takeguchi N. Yamazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2560-2566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was started by addition of ATP (350 μm) to the mixture containing SAV (20 μg/ml) or TV (5 μg/ml), 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 μm acridine orange, 10 μg/ml valinomycin, and 20 mm PIPES-NaOH (pH 7.4). In the experiments to test anion selectivity, 150 mm KCl was replaced with 150 mm KX (X = Br, I, H2PO4, or gluconate). When indicated, SCH28080 (20 μm), a specific inhibitor of H+,K+-ATPase, or DIOA (10 μm), an inhibitor of KCCs, was added. Fluorescence of acridine orange was measured in a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorometer at 25 °C (excitation, 495 nm; emission; 530 nm). The H+ uptake was expressed as change of fluorescence intensity from 0 to 3 min after addition of ATP.Measurement of H+,K+-ATPase Activity—H+,K+-ATPase activities of SAV and TV were measured in a pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase-linked system where hydrolysis of ATP is coupled with oxidation of NADH (21Morii M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21553-21559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained TV (10 μg/ml) or SAV (40 μg/ml), 150 mm KCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 200 μm NADH, 1 mm ATP, 0.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 11 IU/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 4 IU/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 μg/ml valinomycin, and 5 mm PIPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of 10 μm SCH28080. In the experiments to test anion selectivity, 150 mm KCl was replaced with 150 mm KX (X = Br, I, H2PO4, or gluconate). When indicated, DIOA (10 μm) was added. The decrease in the amount of NADH was measured by a Beckman spectrophotometer in a dual wavelength mode at 340 and 500 nm at 25 °C.H+,K+-ATPase activities of freeze-dried vesicles prepared from TV and SAV (10 μg of protein) and the membrane fraction of HEK293 cells (30 μg of protein) were measured in a 1-ml solution containing 15 mm KCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, 2 mm ouabain, and 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) in the presence or absence of 50 μm SCH28080. After incubation for 10 min (freeze-dried vesicles) or 30 min (HEK293 cells) at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of the ice-cold stop solution containing 12% perchloric acid and 3.6% ammonium molybdate, and the inorganic phosphate released was measured (22Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Measurement of 86Rb+ Uptake into SAV—SAV (200 μg of protein) were added to the solution containing 150 mm KX (X = Cl, Br, H2PO4, or gluconate), 3 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 20 μCi/ml 86RbCl, and 5 mm PIPES-Tris (pH 7.4) and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction mixtures were rapidly filtered through a 0.45-μm HAWP filter. The filter was washed with a solution containing 150 mm KX (X = Cl, Br, H2PO4, or gluconate) and 5 mm PIPES-Tris (pH 7.4), transferred to a counting vial, and solubilized with 5 ml of ACS II scintillant. Then the radioactivity of 86Rb+ was countered.Plasmid Construction—Full-length cDNA encoding rat KCC4 was inserted into the pcDNA4/His vector (Invitrogen) by using EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites (KCC4-pcDNA4/His vector). The KCC4 cDNA (with Xpress epitope) cut from the KCC4-pcDNA4/His vector was inserted into the pcDNA5/TO vector by using AflII and XbaI restriction sites (KCC4-pcDNA5/TO vector).Tetracycline-regulated Expression System of KCC4 in HEK293 Cells Stably Expressing H+,K+-ATPase—HEK293 cells stably expressing α- and β-subunits of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase were established as described previously (23Kimura T. Tabuchi Y. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20671-20677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The cells were cotransfected with the KCC4-pcDNA5/TO and pcDNA6/TR vectors (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 and cultured for 24 h. The transfected cells were selected in the presence of 400 units/ml hygromycin B and 6 μg/ml blasticidin S.Measurement of Intracellular pH—Intracellular pH (pHi) of the HEK293 cells was measured by monitoring the fluorescence of BCECF as described previously (24Kimura T. Yoshida A. Tabuchi Y. Ikari A. Takeguchi N. Asano S. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 25Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajendran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar). The cells (1 × 105 cells), seeded on coverslips (13 × 7 mm; Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan) coated with poly-l-lysine and rat tail collagen I (Invitrogen), were cultured for 24 h. Then the cells were treated with or without tetracycline (2 μg/ml) for an additional 24 h. Expression of KCC4 was confirmed by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry.The cells were incubated with BCECF-AM (10 μm) in buffer containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 10.5 mm glucose, and 32 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C. When indicated, DIOA (10 μm) or SCH28080 (10 μm) was added. The coverslip was placed in the chamber of a spectrofluorometer (RF-5000, Shimadzu) equipped with a continuous buffer flow system. Intracellular BCECF was alternately excited with 490 and 440 nm light, and the emitted light was measured at 520 nm. The cells were acid-loaded by successively incubating in the NH3/NH4+-containing buffer composed of 125 mm NaCl, 20 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 10.5 mm glucose, and 32 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and the Na+-free buffer composed of 145 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 10.5 mm glucose, and 32 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). When indicated, DIOA (10 μm) or SCH28080 (10 μm) was added. The time course of pHi recovery after acid loading was monitored.Statistics—Results are shown as means ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and correction for multiple comparisons was made by using Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Comparison between the two groups was made by using Student’s t test. Statistically significant differences were assumed at p < 0.05.RESULTSExpression of KCC4 in Gastric Parietal Cells—First we examined whether KCC4 mRNA was expressed in gastric parietal cells. Northern blotting showed significant expression of KCC4 mRNA (∼4.9 kb) in rabbit gastric parietal cells (Fig. 1A). Western blotting showed that anti-mouse KCC4 antibody reacted with the 165-kDa protein in mouse and rat gastric mucosa and that anti-human KCC4 antibody reacted with the 165-kDa protein in hog and human gastric mucosa (Fig. 1B, upper panels). Both antibodies reacted with the 165-kDa bands in the membrane fraction of HEK293 cells transfected with rat KCC4 (Fig. 1B, cloned KCC4). The specificities of these antibodies for the 165-kDa bands were confirmed by using the corresponding blocking peptide (Fig. 1B, lower panels).In the immunohistochemistry of isolated rat gastric mucosa, KCC4 was found to be colocalized with H+,K+-ATPase, which is expressed in the intracellular tubulovesicles and the apical canalicular membrane of parietal cells (Fig. 2, A-F). The specificity of anti-KCC4 antibody for positive staining was confirmed by using the blocking peptide (Fig. 2, G-I). On the other hand, the distribution pattern of KCC4 was apparently different from that of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit (Fig. 2, J-L). It has been reported that younger parietal cells in the luminal region of the glands much more actively secrete acid than the older parietal cells in the basal region (26Bamberg K. Nylander S.

Physiol. 1997; 272: G161-G171PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sachs G. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 13: S35-S41PubMed Google Scholar). AQP4 has been reported to be localized in the basolateral membrane of the parietal cells at the basal region of the gastric glands (29Carmosino M. Procino G. Nicchia G.P. Mannucci R. Verbavatz J.-M. Gobin R. Svelto M. Valenti G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly the present double immunostaining of KCC4 and AQP4 in the gastric mucosa showed that KCC4 is expressed in the parietal cells more abundantly at the luminal region of the glands than at the basal region. (Fig. 2, M-O).FIGURE 2Immunostaining for KCC4 in isolated rat gastric mucosa. A-C show the same tissue under a microscope (as do D-F, G-I, J-L, and M-O). Double immunostaining was performed with isolated rat gastric mucosa using anti-mouse KCC4 and anti-H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit antibodies (HK) (A-I), anti-KCC4 and anti-Na+,K+-ATPase α1 subunit antibodies (NaK)(J-L), and anti-KCC4 and anti-AQP4 antibodies (M-O).

https://openalex.org/W2034785658,"Heterotrimeric G-protein Gα subunits and GoLoco motif proteins are key members of a conserved set of regulatory proteins that influence invertebrate asymmetric cell division and vertebrate neuroepithelium and epithelial progenitor differentiation. GoLoco motif proteins bind selectively to the inhibitory subclass (Gαi) of Gα subunits, and thus it is assumed that a Gαi·GoLoco motif protein complex plays a direct functional role in microtubule dynamics underlying spindle orientation and metaphase chromosomal segregation during cell division. To address this hypothesis directly, we rationally identified a point mutation to Gαi subunits that renders a selective loss-of-function for GoLoco motif binding, namely an asparagine-to-isoleucine substitution in the αD-αE loop of the Gα helical domain. This GoLoco-insensitivity (“GLi”) mutation prevented Gαi1 association with all human GoLoco motif proteins and abrogated interaction between the Caenorhabditis elegans Gα subunit GOA-1 and the GPR-1 GoLoco motif. In contrast, the GLi mutation did not perturb any other biochemical or signaling properties of Gαi subunits, including nucleotide binding, intrinsic and RGS protein-accelerated GTP hydrolysis, and interactions with Gβγ dimers, adenylyl cyclase, and seven transmembrane-domain receptors. GoLoco insensitivity rendered Gαi subunits unable to recruit GoLoco motif proteins such as GPSM2/LGN and GPSM3 to the plasma membrane, and abrogated the exaggerated mitotic spindle rocking normally seen upon ectopic expression of wild type Gαi subunits in kidney epithelial cells. This GLi mutation should prove valuable in establishing the physiological roles of Gαi·GoLoco motif protein complexes in microtubule dynamics and spindle function during cell division as well as to delineate potential roles for GoLoco motifs in receptor-mediated signal transduction.

Among the signaling components coupled to the intracytosolic side of 7TMRs are the heterotrimeric G-proteins: molecular switches composed of a guanine nucleotide-binding Gα subunit and a Gβγ dimer that transduce 7TMR activation into intracellular modulation of multiple different effectors, including adenylyl cyclases, ion channels, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, and phospholipase C isoforms (2Johnston C.A.

Sci. 2005; 1: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). 7TMR-promoted activation of Gαβγ causes Gα to exchange the more abundant GTP for bound GDP, which in turn causes Gα·GTP and Gβγ to dissociate. Gα·GTP and Gβγ are then free to regulate effector systems that alter cell physiology (4Cabrera-Vera T.M. Vanhauwe J. Thomas T.O. Medkova M. Preininger A. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. Endocr.

This classical 7TMR-initiated G-protein nucleotide cycle is reset by intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity possessed by the Gα subunit.An evolutionarily conserved role for Gα subunits of the adenylyl cyclase inhibitory (Gαi) subfamily has recently been identified in the control of mitotic spindle orientation in cell divisions that generate cellular diversity during organismal development (6Hampoelz B.

Biochem. 2004; 73: 925-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Studies of asymmetric cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos and Drosophila melanogaster embryonic neuroblasts have identified initial steps of this process as generation of cell polarity and segregation of various cell fate determinants to different sides of the polarized cell (8Betschinger J. Knoblich J.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R674-R685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar); the mitotic spindle is then positioned to facilitate appropriate distribution of determinants to daughter cells during chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis. An integral part of the cellular machinery underlying accurate spindle positioning is the involvement of heterotrimeric G-protein Gα and Gβγ subunits in a manner considered independent of 7TMR activation and instead involving RIC-8 (a cytosolic guanine nucleotide exchange factor), GoLoco motif 3The GoLoco motif is also referred to as the G-protein regulatory motif (79Takesono A.

Vertebrate neuroepithelial progenitors use the same cellular machinery to modulate mitotic spindle orientation controlling the balance between asymmetric cell divisions that drive differentiation and planar divisions that favor maintenance and expansion of the neuroepithelial architecture (14Sanada K.

Similarly, an analogous mechanism appears to operate in the stratification and differentiation of mammalian skin (17Lechler T. Fuchs E. Nature. 2005; 437: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar).An essential feature of the various emerging models of G-protein nucleotide cycling in mitotic spindle positioning is the requirement for a Gαi·GoLoco motif complex. For example, in our working model of C. elegans asymmetric cell division controlled by the Gα subunits GOA-1 and GPA-16 (18Afshar K. Willard F.S. Colombo K. Siderovski D.P. Gonczy P. Development (Camb.). 2005; 132: 4449-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Johnston C.A. Afshar K. Snyder J.T. Tall G.G. Gonczy P. Siderovski D.P. Willard F.S. J. Biol.

However, it has not been formally established that the Gα/GoLoco motif interaction is required per se for the function of Gα subunits and GoLoco motif proteins in mitotic spindle positioning. For example, both models of C. elegans asymmetric cell division have been generated primarily by correlating various genetic phenotype data, including loss of pulling forces upon RNA interference-mediated knockdown of goa-1/gpa-16 or gpr-1/2 expression (9Afshar K.

These phenotypic results, although suggestive of a critical function for a Gα·GoLoco protein complex, might alternatively reflect separate and distinct functions of Gα subunits and the multidomain GPR-1/2 proteins in parallel pathways culminating in MT force generation, given that both classes of proteins have other binding partners and established functions. Furthermore, it remains unresolved as to whether Gβγ is an independent signaling entity in this system or merely a buffer of free Gα·GDP levels (14Sanada K. Tsai L.H. Cell. 2005; 122: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23Yu F. Cai Y. Kaushik R. Yang X. Chia W. J.

Here we describe and validate a single point mutation that renders Gαi subunits unable to bind GoLoco motif proteins, yet preserves all other aspects of Gα function. Furthermore, we use this GoLoco-insensitivity (“GLi”) mutation to demonstrate that direct Gα/GoLoco motif interaction is required for the Gα-dependent modulation of MT dynamics during mitotic spindle positioning.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) group protection, high pressure liquid chromatography-purified, and validated by mass spectrometry at the Tufts University Core Facility (Medford, MA).

https://openalex.org/W2061542590,"Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase type 1 (mPGES-1) converts prostaglandin endoperoxides, generated from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases, into prostaglandin E2. This enzyme belongs to the membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) family of integral membrane proteins, and because of its link to inflammatory conditions and preferential coupling to cyclooxygenase 2, it has received considerable attention as a drug target. Based on the high resolution crystal structure of human leukotriene C4 synthase, a model of mPGES-1 has been constructed in which the tripeptide co-substrate glutathione is bound in a horseshoe-shaped conformation with its thiol group positioned in close proximity to Arg-126. Mutation of Arg-126 into an Ala or Gln strongly reduces the enzyme’s prostaglandin E synthase activity (85–95%), whereas mutation of a neighboring Arg-122 does not have any significant effect. Interestingly, R126A and R126Q mPGES-1 exhibit a novel, glutathione-dependent, reductase activity, which allows conversion of prostaglandin H2 into prostaglandin F2α. Our data show that Arg-126 is a catalytic residue in mPGES-1 and suggest that MAPEG enzymes share significant structural components of their active sites.

Based on the high resolution crystal structure of human leukotriene C4 synthase, a model of mPGES-1 has been constructed in which the tripeptide co-substrate glutathione is bound in a horseshoe-shaped conformation with its thiol group positioned in close proximity to Arg-126. Mutation of Arg-126 into an Ala or Gln strongly reduces the enzyme’s prostaglandin E synthase activity (85–95%), whereas mutation of a neighboring Arg-122 does not have any significant effect. Interestingly, R126A and R126Q mPGES-1 exhibit a novel, glutathione-dependent, reductase activity, which allows conversion of prostaglandin H2 into prostaglandin F2α. Our data show that Arg-126 is a catalytic residue in mPGES-1 and suggest that MAPEG enzymes share significant structural components of their active sites. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) 3The abbreviations used are: PGE2, prostaglandin E2 (11α,15S-dihydroxy-9-keto-prosta-5,13-dienoic acid); PGE, prostaglandin E; PGH2, prostaglandin H2 ((15S)-hydroxy-9α,11α-peroxidoprosta-5,13-dienoic acid); PGF2α, prostaglandin F2α (9α,11α,15S-trihydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoic acid); mPGES-1, microsomal PGE synthase-1; LTC4S, leukotriene C4 synthase; MAPEG, membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism. is an abundant lipid mediator that signals via four receptors (EP1 to -4), resulting in an array of important biological actions in physiology as well as pathophysiology (1Samuelsson B.

Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68: 557-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of PGE2 proceeds from arachidonic acid, which is converted to the unstable endoperoxide, prostaglandin H2, by cyclooxygenase type 1 and 2. PGH2 is further isomerized into PGE2 by three distinct enzymes, cytosolic PGE synthase, microsomal PGE synthase type 1 (mPGES-1), and microsomal PGE synthase type 2 (3Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N.

Although cytosolic PGE synthase and microsomal PGE synthase type 2 seem to provide a basal synthesis of PGE2, mPGES-1 appears to account for PGE2 synthesis under proinflammatory conditions. Thus, mPGES-1 is up-regulated by mitogens and cytokines and is functionally coupled to cyclooxygenase type 2 (4Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Due to its key role in PGE2 synthesis, mPGES-1 has attracted attention as a potential drug target in the areas of inflammation, pain, fever, and cancer (7Samuelsson B. Morgenstern R. Jakobsson P.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2007; 59: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). mPGES-1 is a member of the MAPEG superfamily of enzymes (8Jakobsson P.J. Morgenstern R. Mancini J. Ford-Hutchinson A. Persson B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S20-S24Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which also includes two key proteins in the leukotriene cascade, viz. 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein and leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S). Since all MAPEG members are integral membrane proteins, structural information on this family has been scarce. Recently, however, significant progress has been made in this area, and several high and low resolution structures have been solved by three-dimensional as well as two-dimensional crystallography (9Holm P.J.

The crystal structures of human LTC4S clearly provided the most detailed structural information, inter alia a unique, horse-shoe shaped binding conformation of GSH, a hydrophobic crevice presumably binding the lipid substrate leukotriene A4, and an Arg residue, possibly involved in the activation of the GSH thiol. Here we used a homology model, based on the LTC4S structure, and site-directed mutagenesis to identify Arg-126 as a key catalytic residue in mPGES-1. Our data are consistent with the notion that MAPEG members share a structurally similar binding site to accommodate a horseshoe-shaped GSH involved in different catalytic reactions. Materials—The I.M.A.G.E. clones were obtained from the Medical Research Council Geneservice (Cambridge, UK). Enzymes, Escherichia coli TOP10 cells, and pPICZA were from Invitrogen. His6-pSP19T7LT was a kind gift from Dr. Sipra Saha. Anti-mPGES-1 antiserum was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Platinum Pfx polymerase was from Invitrogen, and Pfu polymerase was from Promega (Madison, WI). PGH2 (purity in excess of 95%) was purchased from Larodane Fine Chemicals (Malmo¨, Sweden). Cloning and Plasmid Construction—The human mPGES-1 gene was subcloned into pPICZA from the His6-pSP19T7LT vector. The coding part of the gene, supplemented with an N-terminal in frame sequence encoding a His6 tag, was PCR-amplified using the primer pair 5′-CGACAACTTGAGAAGATCAAAATGTCTCACCATCATCACCACCATCCTGCCCACAGCCTGG and 5′-GCAAGACCGGTCTTCTCTCACAGGTGGCGGGCCGCTTCCCAGAGGATCTGCAGAGCCAT and Pfx polymerase. Also, the linearized vector was PCR-amplified. For this Pfu polymerase, the primers 5′-GAGAAGACCGGTCTTGC and 5′-TTTGATCTTCTCAAGTTGTCG were used. The PCR products were co-transformed into CaCl2-competent E. coli TOP10 cells, utilizing the endogenous recombinase activity of E. coli to recombine the fragments (13Bubeck P. Winkler M. Bautsch W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3601-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The protein coding part of the resulting expression vector, pPICZ-hisMPGES, was sequenced for verification. Mutagenesis—Selected amino acids in pPICZ-hisMPGES were mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Protein Expression and Microsome Preparation—Human recombinant mPGES-1 was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris. For most experiments, the strain KM71H was used, but strain X-33 also worked. The expression vector was transformed into competent P. pastoris cells using the Pichia EasyComp Transformation kit (Invitrogen). Recombinant cells were cultivated in baffled flasks in 2.5 liters of minimal yeast medium with glycerol (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. When A600 reached 10–12, the cells were resuspended in 0.5 liters of minimal yeast medium with 0.5% methanol. After another 72 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation (2,500 × g, 7 min) and resuspended in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mm GSH. Cells were homogenized with glass beads (0.5 mm), and the slurry was filtered through nylon filters (180 μm; Millipore) and centrifuged (5,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g, 65 min), and microsomes were prepared from the pellet by homogenization in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, in a glass homogenizer. The microsome suspension was kept in aliquots at -20 °C. Prior to incubations with GSH analogues, the microsomes were washed from residual GSH: 100 μl of microsomes were mixed with 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, kept on ice for 15 min, and ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g, 30 min); this procedure was repeated 3-fold, and the final pellet was homogenized in 100 μl of buffer. Expression of both nonmutated and mutated mPGES-1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1) using a commercial antiserum (Cayman 160140) specific for mPGES-1. We could not observe any cross-reactivity with other recombinant MAPEG proteins produced in P. pastoris. Western Blot—The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Pharmacia Phast system. Antiserum against mPGES-1 (catalog number 160140; Cayman) and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (catalog number NA934; Amersham Biosciences) were used together with an ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize the proteins. Enzyme Activity Assay—Microsomal suspensions (1.5 μl) were incubated on ice for 5 min with 10 μm PGH2 and 2.5 mm GSH in 300 μl of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.2 ml of 20 mm FeCl2 and 50 mm citric acid, pH 2–3. A solution of [3,3,4,4-2H4]PGE2 (1 μg) and [3,3,4,4-2H4]PGF2α (1 μg) in 200 μl of ethanol was added, and the mixture was applied to a 1-ml Chromabond C18 column for solid phase extraction. Material eluted with 80% methanol was esterified by treatment with diazomethane and trimethylsilylated by treatment with trimethylchlorosilane/hexamethyldisilazane/pyridine (2:1:2, v/v/v). Aliquots of the derivatized material were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a Hewlett-Packard model 5970B mass selective detector connected to a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 5% phenylmethylsilicone capillary column (12 m, 0.33-μm film thickness). Helium was used as the carrier gas, and the column temperature was increased from 120 to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the selected ion monitoring mode using the ions m/z 439 and 443 (unlabeled and deuterated PGE2, respectively) and m/z 423 and 427 (unlabeled and deuterated PGF2α, respectively). The amounts of PGE2 and PGF2α were calculated in the usual manner using ion intensity ratios and the appropriate standard curves. Unreacted PGH2 was decomposed into 12-hydroxy-heptadecatrienoic acid and malondialdehyde by FeCl2 in the stop solution. Homology Modeling—To obtain the mPGES-1 model structure, kindly provided by Professor Pa¨r Nordlund, structure-based sequence alignment of MAPEG members and homology modeling were carried out as described (12Martinez Molina D. Wetterholm A. Kohl A. McCarthy A.A. Niegowski D. Ohlson E. Hammarberg T. Eshaghi S. Haeggstro¨m J.Z. Nordlund P. Nature. 2007; 448: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 14Martinez Molina D. Eshaghi S. Nordlund P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 4: 442-449Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PGH2 was manually fitted in the active site of this model using the computer program O. Microsomal PGES-1 is critical for production of PGE2 during inflammatory reactions and has attracted considerable attention as a drug target. Since this enzyme is an integral membrane protein, information on structure-activity relationships has been scarce and essentially limited to a projection map obtained by two-dimensional crystallography, demonstrating a trimeric quaternary structure (15Thoren S. Weinander R. Saha S. Jegerscho¨ld C. Pettersson P.L. Samuelsson B. Hebert H. Hamberg M. Morgenstern R. Jakobsson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22199-22209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, a rapid and significant progress in this area was recently achieved when the crystal structures of MGST-1, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, and LTC4S were reported (9Holm P.J. Bhakat P.

Niegowski D. Ohlson E. Hammarberg T. Eshaghi S. Haeggstro¨m J.Z. Nordlund P. Nature. 2007; 448: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In particular, the LTC4S structures allowed a detailed view of the enzyme’s active center and revealed a hydrophobic cleft that accommodates the lipid substrate and a deeper pocket for GSH bound in a horseshoe-shaped conformation. In addition, an Arg residue seemed to be positioned for activation of the GSH thiol and formation of a thiolate anion. A Model of mPGES-1 Identifies Arg-126 as a Potential Catalytic Residue—Based on these new three-dimensional structures of MAPEG members, a structure-based sequence alignment was performed (12Martinez Molina D. Wetterholm A. Kohl A. McCarthy A.A. Niegowski D. Ohlson E. Hammarberg T. Eshaghi S. Haeggstro¨m J.Z. Nordlund P. Nature. 2007; 448: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), from which a model of mPGES-1 with bound GSH could be generated (14Martinez Molina D. Eshaghi S. Nordlund P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 4: 442-449Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When compared with the structure of LTC4S, the lipid binding crevice appears wider (Fig. 2), as one would expect from the chemistry of PGH2 as compared with leukotriene A4. The co-substrate GSH is bound in a horseshoe conformation, and Arg-126 has a position compatible with a role in catalysis (Fig. 2). In the primary structure, mPGES-1 contains two additional amino aids in the stretch Tyr-117 to Arg-126, as compared with LTC4S. This difference between mPGES-1 and LTC4S has been disregarded in the model, since the two residues do not appear to have any impact on the α-helical structure carrying Arg-126. Mutation of Arg-126 Strongly Reduces the Isomerase Activity of mPGES-1—Arg-126 in human mPGES-1 was exchanged for an Ala or Gln residue by site-directed mutagenesis. As a control, a neighboring Arg-122 was also mutated into an Ala or Gln residue, respectively. Microsome preparations from yeast cells expressing nonmutated and mutated enzyme were assayed for PGE2 synthase activity. Nonmutated mPGES-1 converted almost all added PGH2 (10 μm) to PGE2 when incubated on ice for 5 min. However, when R126A or R126Q mPGES-1 were incubated with PGH2, a pronounced loss (85–95%; n = 6) of conversion into PGE2 was observed (Fig. 3A). In contrast, R122A and R122Q mPGES-1 retained the activity measured for wild type enzyme. Exchange of GSH for Its Ethylester Is Compatible with Catalysis, whereas Substitution for a Thiolester Does Not Allow any PGE2 Synthase Activity—To gain further mechanistic information, we exchanged GSH for various analogues during the incubation with PGH2 (Fig. 3B). S-methyl-GSH did not result in any PGE2 formation, indicating that the thiol group of GSH is crucial for the reaction. Incubations with GSH-ethylester (esterified at the Cα of Glu), on the other hand, did still result in some PGE2 production (about 28% of nonmutated), which suggests that minor changes of the GSH binding conformation, at least near its Glu carboxylate, still allows a productive position of the GSH free thiol. These data support the proposed role of the thiolate anion as the attacking species of GSH during conversion of PGH2 to PGE2. Mutation of Arg-126 Allows a Reductase Activity That Converts PGH2 into PGF2α—Interestingly, when microsome preparations containing mutants of Arg-126 were incubated with PGH2, we detected a reductase activity rather than an isomerase activity, such that PGF2α appeared as the major product in the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (Figs. 4 and 5A). Both R126A and R126Q mPGES-1 converted PGH2 to PGF2α, a prostanoid with a distinct spectrum of bioactions, different from those of PGE2. This reductase activity also required the presence of GSH and its free thiol, as assessed from incubations with GSH and S-methyl-GSH (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5PGF2α synthase activity of nonmutated and mutated mPGES-1. Shown is PGF2α production when microsomes were incubated with 10 μm PGH2 and 2.5 mm GSH (A) or microsomes, after extensive washing to remove residual GSH, were incubated with 10 μm PGH2 and 2.5 mm GSH or the indicated GSH analogue (B). Each value is a mean of duplicates from one typical experiment (n = 3(A) and n = 2(B)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Putative Mechanism of mPGES-1—Conversion of PGH2 into PGE2 by mPGES-1 is GSH-dependent and involves cleavage of the endoperoxide O–O bond and elimination of the C-9 hydrogen as a proton (16Miyamoto T. Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3645-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this conversion may involve glutathione thiolate as a base in the deprotonation step. Alternatively, it has been suggested that glutathione thiolate attacks the C-9 carbon to produce a thiohemiketal intermediate, which spontaneously rearranges to PGE2 (17Lands W. Lee R. Smith W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 180: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A third possibility would involve attack by glutathione thiolate on the C-9 endoperoxide oxygen, forming a mixed sulfide. Subsequent deprotonation at C-9 and cleavage of the O–S bond would lead to the formation of PGE2 and regeneration of the glutathione thiolate (Fig. 6). It is noteworthy that the mixed sulfide intermediate of this mechanism would be prone to reduction (e.g. it could be attacked by a second glutathione thiolate to produce PGF2α and oxidized glutathione) (Fig. 6). In light of our present data, it seems possible that an important function of the active site amino acid structure of mPGES-1 is to prevent such reduction from taking place and that the Arg-126 mutants are defective in this respect and therefore produce PGF2α rather than PGE2. This notion is also supported by the structural implications of replacing Arg-126, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Both R126A and R126Q mPGES-1 leave more space around the GSH thiol group, thereby allowing for a second GSH molecule to approach in agreement with the observed PGF2α formation. In this context, it may be mentioned that enzymatic conversion of PGH2 into PGF2α by a glutathione-dependent microsomal endoperoxide reductase has been reported (18Burgess J.R. Reddy C.C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 217-226PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the formation of PGE2 and PGF2α by glutathione S-transferase-promoted conversions of PGH2 (19Burgess J.R. Chow N.W. Reddy C.C. Tu C.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).FIGURE 7Model of structural consequences caused by mutations of Arg-126 in mPGES-1. In the homology model, Arg-126 (green, left) has been replaced by Ala (orange, middle) or Gln (violet, right). In addition to GSH (white), the lipid substrate PGH2 (blue) has been manually fitted into the putative active site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From the crystal structure of LTC4S in complex with GSH, it was suggested that Arg-104 is critical for the activation of the GSH thiol and stabilization of the thiolate anion (12Martinez Molina D. Wetterholm A. Kohl A. McCarthy A.A. Niegowski D. Ohlson E. Hammarberg T. Eshaghi S. Haeggstro¨m J.Z. Nordlund P. Nature. 2007; 448: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Since our data show that mutation of the corresponding Arg-126 is detrimental for the PGE2 synthase activity, it is tempting to speculate a similar role for this residue. However, the mutants R126A and R126Q mPGES-1 actually retained a very small, albeit detectable, isomerase activity and also exhibited a significant, GSH-dependent reductase activity, which is likely also to involve formation of a thiolate anion (Figs. 3 and 4). Hence, our data suggest that the primary role of Arg-126 is not activation of the GSH thiol. Further structure-function studies with crystallography and mutagenesis will hopefully clarify the precise role of Arg-126 and other residues involved in the molecular mechanism of mPGES-1 catalysis. During the course of these investigations, Jegerscho¨ld et al. (20Jegerscho¨ld C. Pawelzik S.C. Purhonen P. Bhakat P. Gheorghe K.R. Gyobu N. Mitsuoka K. Morgenstern R. Jakobsson P.J. Hebert H. Proc.

GSH was found to bind in a U-shaped conformation, and, interestingly, the authors could not find an access path for PGH2 to the bound GSH molecule, indicating that the protein was in a closed conformation and that dynamic changes, involving helices 1 and 4, occur at the active site during binding and turnover of the lipid substrate. A putative structure of an open conformation of the active site, with a critical Arg residue (Arg-126), was obtained through modeling against the crystal structure of human LTC4S. Hence, the mPGES-1 structure presented by Jegerscho¨ld et al. (20Jegerscho¨ld C. Pawelzik S.C. Purhonen P. Bhakat P. Gheorghe K.R. Gyobu N. Mitsuoka K. Morgenstern R. Jakobsson P.J. Hebert H. Proc.

A. 2008; 105: 11110-11115Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) agrees very well with the results of our own investigation and suggests that further mechanistic studies must take into account the consequences of protein dynamics.

With both mutants, a rapid increase in Trp fluorescence was observed only in the case of normal base pairing (G:C), was saturable with respect to dCTP concentration, and occurred in the absence of phosphodiester bond formation.

Replicative DNA polymerases insert dNTPs with high efficiency and fidelity but lose much of this capacity when they encounter DNA lesions that do not closely resemble the four canonical bases (A, T, C, or G), leading to deleterious miscoding and/or blocks to further polymerization (1Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16895-16898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In the past decade the slower and less efficient Y-family and other translesion DNA polymerases have been characterized and found to often replace replicative polymerases at these blocked junctions (2Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 74: 317-353Crossref Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Based on biochemical and structural analysis, a popular consensus is that abnormal substrate geometry forms the basis for this “switch” to a translesion polymerase (3Kool E.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 4Lehmann A.R. Niimi A. Ogi T. Brown S. Sabbioneda S. Wing J.F. Kannouche P.L. Green C.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Whereas replicative DNA polymerases use numerous residues to bind tightly to properly shaped substrates to bring about rapid and processive polymerization, Y-family polymerases make fewer protein-substrate contacts and allow aberrant shapes within their active sites (6Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W.

Generally it is believed that replicative polymerases bind DNA tightly, followed by binding a correct dNTP (sorted from the mixture of all four that the DNA polymerase encounters) that instigates an “induced-fit” conformational change to form an active ternary complex leading to high efficiency and fidelity polymerization, e.g. (7Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar).

The induced-fit conformational change has been shown by crystallography to involve a large closing of the “O” helix of the fingers domain around the nascent base pair (8Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 9Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar), although recent studies indicate that the one or more conformational changes most responsible for high efficiency and fidelity polymerization must involve more subtle events that occur afterward and/or before this large change (10Purohit V. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10200-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Showalter A.K.

Cell. 2005; 19: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).What remains unclear is whether or not there are similarly subtle events, unseen by crystallographic and other methods (e.g. atomic level dynamics simulations performed by Schlick and colleagues (13Wang Y. Arora K. Schlick T. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)), which comprise an induced-fit conformational change prior to selective dNTP polymerization by the Y-family DNA polymerases. Crystal structures of Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4), a model Y-family DNA polymerase, have not shown obvious closing of residues around an incipient base pair; however, some discreet stepwise “shifts” of the enzyme are seen upon dNTP binding (forward movement of residues within the fingers, palm, and little finger domains, at the distance of a base pair) and following catalysis (the thumb follows suit (14Rechkoblit O. Malinina L. Cheng Y. Kuryavyi V. Broyde S. Geacintov N.E. Patel D.J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e11Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)). Whether these changes are coupled to productive catalysis is not clear. Fiala and Suo (15Fiala K.A. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) demonstrated a low α-phosphothioate elemental (“thio”) effect for correct dNTP phosphodiester bond formation by Dpo4, consistent with important conformational change(s) existing within the catalytic cycle, but the conclusiveness of the thio effects in elucidation of mechanisms has been questioned (16Herschlag D. Piccirilli J.A. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4844-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Fiala and Suo (15Fiala K.A. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) also compared product amplitudes in pulse-chase and pulse-quench experiments and concluded that Dpo4 is bound more tightly in a ternary complex, insinuating that there must be a conformational change to “lock” the complex, although the amplitudes did not appear to be statistically different. DeLucia et al. (17DeLucia A.M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10790-10803Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) used fluorescence measurements with 2-aminopurine in the substrate template to demonstrate that the Dpo4 homolog Dbh undergoes what the authors conclude to be multiple protein and DNA conformational states during the catalytic cycle, although no evidence was presented to show that it was the enzyme that was involved in the fluorescence changes. A similar study with the non-processive rat pol β and 2-aminopurine oligonucleotides was recently reported by Roettger et al. (18Roettger M.P. Bakhtina M. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9718-9727Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).We sought evidence for a critical conformational change in Y-family DNA polymerases from the protein point of view, i.e. by fluorescent labeling of the enzyme rather than the DNA substrate to directly follow environmental changes of protein domains and avoid the complexity of base pairing, stacking, and other phenomena seen with fluorescent oligonucleotides. Others have used protein-based fluorescence to study replicative polymerases, e.g. Tsai and Johnson (19Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) observed fluorescence changes with a coumarin-labeled “Cys-light” bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase and identified two conformational states prior to catalysis, one for correct dNTP positioning and another for incorrect dNTP positioning. The absence of Trp in wild-type Dpo4 provided an opportunity to prepare and utilize several single Trp mutants, based on available crystal structures. Two Dpo4 Trp mutants (Fig. 1), having full catalytic activity, revealed fluorescence changes that we interpret as conformational changes associated with (correct) dNTP positioning prior to catalysis and post-catalytic “relaxing” of the complex following rapid release of PPi, documented using independent kinetic experiments. We used the measured rates of fluorescence changes in developing minimal kinetic models and obtained satisfactory fitting of the catalytic data.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. Unlabeled dNTPs were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). MDCC, PNPase, PPase, and 7-MeGuo were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. High-performance liquid chromatography-purified synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) or Midland Certified Reagant Co. (Midland, TX), and concentrations were determined spectrally using the nearest-neighbor method (20Borer P.N. Fasman G.D. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 3rd. Ed. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1975: 589-590Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.DNA Sequences—Primer-template sequences used in this study are as follows: the 13-mer primer strand 5′-GGGGGAAGGATTC-3′ and 18-mer template strand 5′-TCACXGAATCCTTCCCCC-3′, where X = G or 8-oxoG, were annealed together and are designated in the text as either DNAG or DNAG★, respectively. For analysis of fluorescence changes in the absence of chemistry, the 3′-end of the primer strand was rendered incapable of phosphoryl transfer by replacing the 3′-OH with a proton and is termed DNAGdd in the text. In some experiments, the 14-mer primer sequence 5′-GGGGGAAGGATTCC-3′ was annealed to the 18-mer template 5′-TCACGGAATCCTTCCCCC-3′ to investigate the fluorescence changes that occur, using a slightly different sequence context.Dpo4 Trp Mutants—Wild-type Dpo4 contained a 6-histidine tag on the N terminus and was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid permeation and Mono-S chromatography as described previously (21Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.-Y. Irminia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29750-29764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Purified Dpo4 was stored in small aliquots at -80 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7 at 22 °C) containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol (v/v).Mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and sequences were verified in the Vanderbilt DNA Sequencing Facility prior to bacterial expression. The Dpo4 T239W mutant was made using the following primers: sense, 5′-AGCTAGAGACGAGTATAACGAGCCTATAAGATGGAGAGTACGAAAGAGTA-3′; antisense, 5′-TACTCTTTCGTACTCTCCATCTTATAGGCTCGTTATACTCGTCTCTAGCT-3′.

Mutant proteins were expressed, purified, and stored using the same procedure as for wild-type enzyme (21Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.-Y. Irminia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29750-29764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), except that the 80 °C heat step was omitted because of the possibility of decreased mutant stability.MDCC-PBP—The plasmid containing E. coli PBP with an A197C mutation, competent cells, and protocols for expression and labeling by MDCC were generously provided by C. E. Cameron (Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA) and K. D. Raney (University of Arkansas Medical Center, Little Rock, AR). PBP was expressed from a pET-Ub-based plasmid in E. coli BL21(DE3)pCG1 competent cells in NZCYM media supplemented with 25 μg of kanamycin ml-1 and 20 μg of chloramphenicol ml-1. The pCG1 vector expresses a yeast ubiquitin protease that frees the fused protein from ubiquitin to produce mature protein (22Gohara D.W. Ha C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures (100 ml) were grown in NZCYM media supplemented with 25 μg of kanamycin ml-1, 20 μg of chloramphenicol ml-1, and 0.1% dextrose (w/v) at 30 °C (overnight) and used to inoculate 500 ml of NZCYM media containing 10 ml of a sugar solution (250 g of glycerol, 25 g of dextrose, and 100 g of lactose diluted to 1 liter), 25 ml of NPS solution (66 g of (NH4)2SO4, 136 g of monobasic potassium phosphate, and 142 g of dibasic sodium phosphate diluted to 1 liter), and 5 ml of a metal mixture (100 mm FeCl3, 1 m CaCl2, 1 m MnCl2, 1 m ZnSO4, 200 mm CoCl2, 100 mm CuCl2, 200 mm NiCl2, 100 mm Na2MoO4, 100 mm Na2SeO3, and 100 mm H3BO3). The cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration at 250 rpm to A600 = 1.0 and then cooled to 20 °C for overnight growth (12-16 h). Cells were harvested by pelleting at 6 × 103 × g in a Sorvall Model RC3B-Plus centrifuge (swinging bucket rotor) for 10 min (4 °C), washed once in 100 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA), pelleted again, and stored at -80 °C. Each 500-ml culture yielded ∼10 g of wet cell weight.Cells were suspended at a concentration of 4 mg of protein ml-1 in 50 mm sodium HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol (v/v) and supplemented with protease-inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Biosciences, Indianapolis, IN) prior to lysis by sonication; the lysed cells were pelleted in a Beckman 45Ti rotor at 7 × 104 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Polyethylene glycol 8000 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 6% (w/v) while stirring at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 104 × g for 10 min. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to 60% saturation, followed by centrifugation at 104 × g for 10 min; more solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to 80% saturation, followed by centrifugation at 7 × 104 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet contained primarily the protein of interest, which was dissolved in and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1.0 mm MgCl2. Further purification was by Q-Sepharose chromatography as described by Brune et al. (23Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).Purified PBP was labeled with MDCC in the presence of a “phosphate mop,” as described by C. E. Cameron and K. D. Raney (personal communication). The phosphate mop removes trace Pi from solution by covalently coupling N7-MeGuo with Pi enzymatically using PNPase. To 1 ml of 100 μm Q-Sepharose-purified PBP was added N7-MeGuo to a final concentration of 2 mm, PNPase to 103 unit ml-1, and Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) to 10 mm. After 30 min of incubation time (to allow for any free Pi to be eliminated via the phosphate mop), MDCC (25 mm stock, dissolved in dimethylformamide) was added to a final concentration of 2 mm and the sample was slowly rotated overnight at 22 °C. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged at 1.5 × 104 × g for 60 s to pellet undissolved MDCC, and the resulting supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 μm sodium phosphate in preparation for chromatography on a Mono-Q column equilibrated with the same buffer solution. As described by Brune et al. (23Brune M. Hunter J.L. Howell S.A. Martin S.R. Hazlett T.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10370-10380Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the resulting preparation of PBP-MDCC contains a mixture of Pi-responsive and -unresponsive protein. Two major peaks were eluted from the Mono-Q column: the protein in the first peak was highly Pi-responsive, producing a 10-fold increase in fluorescence emission at 465 nm (excitation at 435 nm) at a rate of 450 s-1 at saturating Pi concentration, measured by stopped-flow fluorescence measurements at 10 °C (data not shown).5′-End Labeling of Primers and Annealing to Primer-Template Complexes—The 13-mer DNA primer was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-polynucleotide kinase and annealed to the 18-mer templates as described previously (24Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar, 25Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8410-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar).Reaction Buffer and Conditions—Unless stated otherwise, reactions were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4 at 37 °C) containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol (v/v). Although bovine serum albumin is often used in DNA polymerase assays, it was not added here because it contains two tryptophan residues that could interfere with the fluorescence of the Trp-Dpo4 mutants. Deletion of albumin was found not have an effect on the rate of DNA polymerization.Chemical Quench Analysis—In the determination of the steady-state parameters kcat and Km for single nucleotide incorporation, typical assays included (all concentrations are final) 1 μm 32P-primer-labeled DNAG, 5 mm MgCl2, and various concentrations of dNTP mixed together prior to adding 1-5 nm enzyme, in a final volume of 10 μl. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and then quenched by the addition of 10 μl of gel loading dye (90% formamide in 90 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) containing 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.05% bromphenol blue, w/v). Products were separated by gel electrophoresis (20% polyacrylamide (w/v), 7 m urea) and analyzed by phosphorimaging using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain the needed parameters using non-linear regression with the program Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). In these steady-state determinations, the concentration of product DNA did not exceed 25% of the total concentration of substrate DNA.A KinTek RQF-3 model chemical quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) was used to perform pre-steady-state experiments. Typically, excess wild-type or mutant Dpo4 (1-5 μm), incubated with 300 nm primer-labeled DNAG, was rapidly mixed with 5 mm MgCl2 and various concentrations of dNTP to obtain the nucleoside triphosphate-dependent rate of polymerization, kp. Incubations proceeded for a set amount of time (5 ms to 20 s) before samples were quenched with 0.37 m EDTA, and the substrate and product primers were separated by electrophoresis and analyzed by phosphorimaging.Fluorescence Emission Spectra—An OLIS DM-45 spectrofluorometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA) was used to record emission spectra of Dpo4 Trp mutants and PBP-MDCC (at 22 °C). For Dpo4 Trp mutants (excitation at 290 nm), the emission spectra of various complexes of Dpo4 Trp mutants were recorded before and after addition of substrates (e.g. DNA or dNTP to form binary or ternary complexes, respectively), scanning from 320 to 420 nm. For PBP-MDCC, detection of fluorescence intensities with and without Pi was achieved by exciting the chromophore at 435 nm and detecting emission over a wavelength range of 435-590 nm. Reaction buffer alone was used as a reference standard for subtraction.Stopped-flow Fluorescence Measurements—An OLIS RSM-1000 spectrofluorometer was used in measurements involving transient fluorescent assays. For optimal signal/noise ratios for observing changes in Trp fluorescence, 3.16-mm slits (20 nm bandwidth) were employed along with both 335 nm long-pass (CVI Laser Corp., Albuquerque, NM) and 355 nm bandpass filters (Newport, Irvine, CA) attached to the sample photomultiplier tube. MgCl2 (5 mm) was included in all syringes. In typical experiments for measuring the effect of dNTP binding on fluorescence of the Dpo4 Trp mutants, one syringe contained mutant Dpo4 plus DNAGdd, and the second syringe contained various concentrations (up to 900 μm) of the correct dNTP. After rapid mixing, the final concentration of Dpo4:DNA was 1 μm. For determination of DNA off-rates, Dpo4 T239W (in one syringe, 1 μm) was present in an equimolar complex with DNA and rapidly mixed with a 5-fold excess of wild-type protein from the second syringe. Alternatively, the DNA was added to wild-type Dpo4 and was rapidly mixed with a 5-fold excess of mutant enzyme. For analysis of ternary complex DNAGdd off-rates, Dpo4 mutant Y12W was added in 5-fold excess to a 1 μm wild-type Dpo4·DNAGdd·dCTP complex. Both syringes contained 500 μm dCTP. In all cases, standard assays were performed, including all components except the reagent producing a change (dNTP in the case of nucleotide dependence on fluorescence changes, or DNA in the case of DNA off-rate determinations).Observation of PPi release during DNA polymerization was measured as described by Hanes and Johnson (26Hanes J.W. Johnson K.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6973-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Hanes J.W. Johnson K.A. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCC-PBP fluorescence was observed (OLIS RSM-1000) using 1.24-mm slits (8 nm bandwidth) along with an Oriel 455 nm long-pass filter (Oriel, Stratford, CT) coupled to the photomultiplier tube. To ensure that free Pi was minimal prior to mixing of syringe contents, a mixture of 200 μm N7-MeGuo, 0.2 unit of PNPase ml-1, and 0.005 unit of yeast PPase ml-1 was present in both syringes, along with reaction buffer. A mixture of 500 μm dCTP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1.1 μm PBP-MDCC from one syringe was rapidly mixed with a mixture of 1.2 μm Dpo4 T239W and 200 nm DNAG from the other, and the resulting Pi binding to PBP-MDCC (following release of PPi due to DNA polymerization and rapid hydrolysis of PPi to Pi by PPase) was observed by monitoring the increase in fluorescence emission at 465 nm (455 nm long-pass Oriel filter, excitation at 435 nm).Data Analysis—The data obtained from gel electrophoresis and fluorescence experiments was analyzed by non-linear regression using Equation 1, y = Ai(1 − e−Kit)+c(Eq. 1) where y is the concentration or signal produced over time, Ai is the amplitude of the signal, ki is the observed rate constant, and c is the starting point. Kinetic parameters obtained using Equation 1 were fit to the following hyperbolic function to describe the concentration dependence, y = ki[S]/(Kd + [S]) + c(Eq. 2) where S is the substrate concentration, ki is the maximum rate constant, Kd is the apparent dissociation constant with S, and c is the starting point.To obtain fits to fluorescence decays, Equation 3 was used, y = Ae−krt + c(Eq. 3) where kr is the rate of decay.Global Data Fitting—Pre-steady-state and steady-state data were fitted using the program DynaFit (28Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Best fits were obtained to plots of time courses or rates versus substrate concentrations using least-squares curve fitting by Levenberg-Marquardt methods, based upon integration of ordinary differential equations.RESULTSConstruction of Dpo4 Trp Mutants—Wild-type Dpo4 is devoid of Trp.

Constructs with Trp substitutions at each of these sites were prepared, and the proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified. Five of the seven mutants had only low catalytic activity in preliminary assays and were not used for catalytic experiments (Y12W, F37W, Y48W, R332W, and Y274W). Two mutants, T239W and N188W (Fig. 1), were highly active (Table 1) and were utilized. Dpo4 T239W has the Trp residue in a region near the “little finger” domain, which has roles in fidelity and lesion bypass (36Boudsocq F. Kokoska R.J. Plosky B.S. Vaisman A. Ling H. Kunkel T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2053280019,"Fission yeast Pkl1 is a kinesin-14A family member that is known to be localized at the cellular spindle and is capable of hydrolyzing ATP. However, its motility has not been detected. Here, we show that Pkl1 is a slow, minus end-directed microtubule motor with a maximum velocity of 33 ± 9 nm/s. The Km,MT value of steady-state ATPase activity of Pkl1 was as low as 6.4 ± 1.1 nm, which is 20–30 times smaller than that of kinesin-1 and another kinesin-14A family member, Ncd, indicating a high affinity of Pkl1 for microtubules. However, the duty ratio of 0.05 indicates that Pkl1 spends only a small fraction of the ATPase cycle strongly associated with a microtubule. By using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated that single molecules of Pkl1 were not highly processive but only exhibited biased one-dimensional diffusion along microtubules, whereas several molecules of Pkl1, probably fewer than 10 molecules, cooperatively moved along microtubules and substantially reduced the diffusive component in the movement. Our results suggest that Pkl1 molecules work in groups to move and generate forces in a cooperative manner for their mitotic functions.

However, the duty ratio of 0.05 indicates that Pkl1 spends only a small fraction of the ATPase cycle strongly associated with a microtubule. By using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated that single molecules of Pkl1 were not highly processive but only exhibited biased one-dimensional diffusion along microtubules, whereas several molecules of Pkl1, probably fewer than 10 molecules, cooperatively moved along microtubules and substantially reduced the diffusive component in the movement. Our results suggest that Pkl1 molecules work in groups to move and generate forces in a cooperative manner for their mitotic functions. The functioning of mitotic spindles involves the coordinated activities of diverse microtubule (MT) 2The abbreviations used are: MTmicrotubuleGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidQdotquantum dotGSTglutathione S-transferaseMSDmean square displacement 2The abbreviations used are: MTmicrotubuleGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidQdotquantum dotGSTglutathione S-transferaseMSDmean square displacement-based motor proteins. Kinesin-related proteins play crucial roles in such functions as spindle assembly, maintenance, and chromosome segregation. They exert forces on MTs to translocate a cargo or MTs themselves (i.e. cross-link and slide MTs). Most members of the kinesin family move toward the plus ends of MTs, whereas several members that belong to the kinesin-14A (Kar3/Ncd) family exhibit minus end-directed motility. The minus end-directed kinesins are believed to have two roles for spindle functioning. The first role is to generate counteracting forces against plus end-directed motors to maintain the spindle (1O'Connell M.J. Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. Morris N.R. J.

The second role is to organize spindle MTs at MT minus ends and focus them into spindle poles (5Hatsumi M. Endow S.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Walczak C.E.

However, despite much progress in recent years on spindle functioning of eukaryotic cells, the precise interpretation of the functions of motors remains complicated and controversial. microtubule green fluorescent protein 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid quantum dot glutathione S-transferase mean square displacement microtubule green fluorescent protein 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid quantum dot glutathione S-transferase mean square displacement To elucidate the detailed mechanisms of spindle dynamics, it is necessary to characterize the motile properties of these motor proteins at a molecular level and to construct a model explaining the robust and dynamic spindle system. However, during the division of multicellular eukaryotes, it is difficult to specify the roles of each component due to the existence of a large number of potential contributors. In contrast, in the unicellular fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, there are nine kinesin family members, and among them, only five members are thought to participate in the mitotic functions (8Pidoux A.L. LeDizet M. Cande W.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Troxell C.L. Sweezy M.A. West R.R. Reed K.D. Carson B.D. Pidoux A.L. Cande W.Z. McIntosh J.R.

Biol. 2002; 12: 610-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); this offers an ideal model system to study mitotic processes because of its minimal motor constitution and because it has a lot of similarities with the mitotic processes of higher eukaryotes. In the fission yeast, there are two members of the kinesin-14A family, Pkl1 and Klp2, both of which have been shown to be inessential (9Troxell C.L. Sweezy M.A. West R.R. Reed K.D. Carson B.D. Pidoux A.L. Cande W.Z. McIntosh J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3476-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, they have to affect MT organization. They are required for the normal function of the spindle poles and spindle MTs, although neither their in vitro motility nor their exact mitotic functions have been elucidated (12Carazo-Salas R.E. Antony C. Nurse P. Science. 2005; 309: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Grishchuk E.L. Spiridonov I.S. McIntosh J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2216-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Pkl1 is localized at the cell nucleus during interphase and at the spindle and spindle poles during mitosis (8Pidoux A.L. LeDizet M. Cande W.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that Pkl1 deletion rescues the mutant phenotype of cut7, a fission yeast plus end-directed kinesin-5 family member, and the overexpression of Pkl1 results in phenotypes similar to those observed in cut7 mutants (8Pidoux A.L. LeDizet M. Cande W.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Troxell C.L. Sweezy M.A. West R.R. Reed K.D. Carson B.D. Pidoux A.L. Cande W.Z. McIntosh J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3476-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Pkl1 provides counteracting forces against Cut7 in the spindle. It has also been shown that Pkl1 is functionally related to γ-tubulin in the microtubule-organizing center (14Paluh J.L. Nogales E. Oakley B.R. McDonald K. Pidoux A.L. Cande W.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1225-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which has been thought to contribute to spindle bipolarity. Most recently, direct association of Pkl1 motor domain with γ-tubulin has been demonstrated (15Rodriguez A.S. Batac J. Killilea A.N. Filopei J. Simeonov D.R. Lin I. Paluh J.L. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that Pkl1 affects the MT organization via direct interactions with both spindle pole and microtubule-organizing center complexes to regulate spindle bipolarity. The motor domains of Pkl1 are similar in sequence to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinesin-14A motor Kar3 (16Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 1029-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), which is a well studied minus end-directed motor and also contributes to mitotic processes (17Tanaka K.

Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 861-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As reported for Kar3 (19Endow S.A. Kang S.J. Satterwhite L.L. Rose M.D. Skeen V.P. Salmon E.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), Pkl1 is expected to be motile, but a previous study reported that motility was not detected, although it had ATPase and MT binding activities (8Pidoux A.L. LeDizet M. Cande W.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that Pkl1 is in fact an MT minus end-directed motor protein. To obtain further insights into the motile properties of Pkl1, we focused on its processivity: an ability to perform several stepping cycles without detaching from a filament. Processive movements have been reported for kinesin-1 (20Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 21Vale R.D. Funatsu T. Pierce D.W.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and some other kinesin-related proteins, which move a long distance without dissociating from MTs. Nonprocessive movement has been described for several kinesin-related proteins, which work in small groups or in an array of motors like muscle myosin. Because little is known about the molecular mechanisms of kinesin-14A family members other than Ncd and Kar3, it is important to identify whether the motor domains of these members share a low duty ratio, non-processive motility. By using a combination of biochemical and single-molecule techniques, we demonstrated that Pkl1 is a low duty ratio motor that has features both similar to and distinct from those of Ncd. Moreover, we compared the motility of Pkl1 in single- and multiple-molecule assays, reporting potentially important properties for its mitotic functions. Cloning—The DNA encoding the N-terminal part (amino acids 1–436) of S. pombe Pkl1 was amplified by PCR as two separate parts to remove the intron of S. pombe genomic DNA (53 nucleotides). The two sets of forward and reverse primers are as follows: 5′-GGGGGATCCATGGTAATTGAGAATACAAAGGACATTTCCATA-3′ containing a BamHI site (underlined) and 5′-TATCTTGCTTGGCCTTTTC-3′;5′-TTTTAGAAACAAAAGAAAATCTTT-3′ and 5′-CCCGAATTCTGGCCATTATTTCTTTCTT-3′ containing an EcoRI site (underlined). These fragments were ligated to the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pUC119 (Takara bio). To construct GST-Pkl1N, the N-terminal fragment of pkl1 was ligated to the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare). The DNA encoding Pkl1H, a C-terminal fragment (amino acids 353–832) of Pkl1, was amplified by PCR from S. pombe genomic DNA with the forward and reverse primers 5′-GGGTCGCGACTTAAAAGGAGAATATCTG-3′ and 5′-GGGGAATTCTTAACGTTTATAATGTTTAATAG-3′ containing NruI and EcoRI sites (underlined). The PCR product was digested with NruI/EcoRI and ligated into pUC119. The intron (125 nucleotides) was removed by site-directed mutagenesis. The DNA encoding full-length Pkl1 (Pkl1F) was constructed with the pUC119/pkl1H plasmid and the N-terminal fragment using the BamHI/MscI sites. SNAP-Pkl1F and AviTag-Pkl1F were constructed by ligating the BamHI/EcoRI fragment from the pUC119/pkl1F plasmid to a modified pET-32a vector (Novagen) containing an N-terminal SNAP tag (Covalys) or AviTag (Avidity). The linker amino acid sequence between SNAP tag and Pkl1 is GS, and that between AviTag and Pkl1 is PRDIGS. To construct GFP-Pkl1H and AviTag-Pkl1H, the pkl1H fragment was digested with NruI/EcoRI and ligated into the SmaI/MfeI sites of a modified pET-14b vector (Novagen) containing an N-terminal His6 tag followed by green fluorescent protein (GFP; F64L/S65T/A206K variant) or ligated into the NruI/EcoRI site of a modified pET-32a vector containing an N-terminal AviTag. The linker amino acid sequence between GFP and Pkl1 is GPE, and that between AviTag and Pkl1 is PREL. To construct Pkl1H, the pkl1 fragment was PCR-amplified from pUC119/pkl1H vector with the forward and reverse primers, 5′-GGGGGATCCACATCATCATCATCATCACAAACGCTGCAAAAGGAGAATATCTGAGTTG-3′, containing a BamHI site (underlined) and a His6 tag, and 5′-GGGGAATTCTTAACGTTTATAATG-3′, containing an EcoRI site (underlined). The PCR products were ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pET-17b expression vector (Novagen). To construct GFP-Pkl1S and Pkl1S, the forward and reverse PCR primers, 5′-GGGCCCGGGCCGGAGAAATGAAGATATGTA-3′ and 5′-GGGGAATTCTTAACGTTTATAATGTTTAATAG-3′, containing SmaI and EcoRI sites (underlined), were used. The pkl1S fragment was cloned into pET-14b (Novagen) or pET-14b/GFP vector, as described for Pkl1H. In the resultant GFP-Pkl1S construct, the linker amino acid sequence between GFP and Pkl1 is GPG. The sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification—Plasmids were transformed into BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen) or BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) RIL (Stratagene) host cells for expression in bacteria. Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression was induced at A600 = 0.7 with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (expressed as final concentration). Cells were grown for a further 4–6 h at 20 °C and then harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Proteins were purified as described previously (24Furuta K. Toyoshima Y.Y. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 152-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), except that the gel filtration process was performed on an NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) and that the final MT affinity purification step was modified for SNAP-Pkl1F and AviTag-Pkl1F due to the low recovery rate; proteins were cosedimented with MTs, and the precipitate was resuspended and placed on ice for use in further assays. GST-Pkl1N was purified by GST·bind resin (catalog number 70541; Novagen). SNAP-vitro 647 labeling of SNAP-Pkl1F was performed at a mixing ratio of 1:3 (Pkl1F head/SNAP-vitro 647) for 30 min at room temperature. Preparation of Tubulin and Polarity-marked MTs—Tubulin was purified from porcine brain (25Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). Polarity-marked MTs labeled with X-rhodamine succinimidyl ester (catalog number C-1309; Invitrogen) were prepared according to Hyman et al. (26Hyman A. Drechsel D. Kellogg D. Salser S. Sawin K. Steffen P. Wordeman L. Mitchison T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and stabilized with 20 μm paclitaxel. The Cy5 (catalog number PA25001; GE Healthcare) or BODIPY-FL (catalog number D-6102; Invitrogen) labeling of tubulin were performed as described (24Furuta K. Toyoshima Y.Y. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 152-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—The sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of Pkl1 in assay buffer (12 mm PIPES-KOH, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol was determined by using 5–25 or 5–40% (w/v) sucrose gradient centrifugation, as previously described (27Pierce D.W. Hom-Booher N. Otsuka A.J. Vale R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5412-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gel filtration chromatography was performed with the buffer described above, with the addition of 300 mm potassium acetate to prevent nonspecific adsorption (TSKgel G3000SWXL; Tosoh). Stokes radii were determined from a plot of elution volumes versus the radii of standard proteins (28Andrews P. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1970; 18: 1-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular weights were calculated according to Equation 1, M=6πNη0×rStokes×s20,w/(1−νρ)(Eq. 1) where η0 is the viscosity of the solvent (1.0 × 10-2 g/cm/s2), N is Avogadro's number, ν is the average partial specific volume of the sample (0.725 cm3/g), and ρ is the density of the solvent (1.0 g/cm3) (29Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry.2. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1980: 591-685Google Scholar). Steady-state ATPase Measurement—The steady-state ATPase activity of GFP-Pkl1 was assayed with the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (catalog number E6646; Invitrogen) in assay buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 mg/ml casein, and 1% (v/v) Tween 20 at 25 °C. MTs were sedimented through a 25% sucrose cushion (200,000 × g for 15 min) and resuspended with assay buffer supplemented with 20 μm paclitaxel to remove excess GTP. MTs were recentrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min to remove aggregates and used within 2 h. The kinetic parameters were determined by hyperbolic regression (y = Vmax × [S]/([S] + Km), where S is either ATP or MT concentration). MT Gliding Assays—MT gliding assays were performed in assay buffer supplemented with ATP and 10 μm paclitaxel under a dark field microscope, as described previously (24Furuta K. Toyoshima Y.Y. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 152-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For assays using AviTag, the flow chamber was first coated with streptavidin (catalog number 192-11644; Wako) to immobilize biotinylated AviTag-fused proteins. The gliding velocity of MTs that moved in a continuous manner for at least 30 s was measured. MT Bundling Assays—The samples were prespun at 16,000 × g for 10 min to remove any protein aggregates. MT bundling assays were performed in assay buffer with 0.3–3 μm MTs, 0.05–0.1 μm proteins, 10 μm paclitaxel, and 0–1 mm ATP. The mixture was rocked at room temperature for 30 min and then observed under a dark field microscope. Single-molecule Motility Assays—The movements of individual GFP fusion proteins were observed with a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope as described previously (24Furuta K. Toyoshima Y.Y. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 152-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, the chamber was coated twice with anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (T-6199; Sigma) for 5 min and blocked with ∼7 mg/ml dephosphorylated casein (catalog number C-8032; Sigma) for 5 min. Cy5-MTs or BODIPY-FL-MTs were then introduced and incubated for 5 min. After washing with assay buffer, the chamber was filled with assay buffer containing 100–500 pm Pkl1 protein, 10 μm paclitaxel, 0.7 mg/ml casein (catalog number C-8032; Sigma), 0.2 mg/ml casein (catalog number 2242; Merck), 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.2% (w/w) glucose, 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 85 units/ml glucose oxidase (catalog number G-2133; Sigma), 1,300 units/ml catalase (catalog number 106810; Roche Applied Science), and 5 mm ATP. After the movements were recorded, the polarity of the MTs was determined by observing the direction of the movement of kinesin-GFP or kinesin-Alexa647. Photobleaching behavior was analyzed by integrating intensities from 9 × 9 pixels and subtracting the background. The photobleaching rates of GFP-Pkl1H and SNAP-Pkl1F were 0.031 and 0.020 s-1, respectively (Fig. S1). These values were slower than the detachment rate of GFP-Pkl1H and SNAP-Pkl1F (0.072–0.10 s-1). The mean duration was determined by using nonlinear fitting of the cumulative probability distribution 1 - exp((t0 - t)/τ) (30Thorn K.S. Ubersax J.A. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The fit parameters used were t0 and τ. The run length is defined as the distance between the appearance and disappearance of a spot on the MT. A minus symbol refers to the polarity of the MT. The instantaneous velocity was calculated from the pairwise distances for window size 2.0 s (31Inoue Y. Iwane A.H. Miyai T. Muto E. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2838-2850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MSD ρ(τ) was plotted by averaging the squared displacement for nonoverlapping intervals τ (32Qian H. Sheetz M.P. Elson E.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 910-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The diffusion constant and the drift velocity were determined by fitting ρ(τ) with ρ(τ) = 2Dτ + v2τ2 (where D represents a diffusion coefficient and v is drift velocity) to the first six time intervals of the obtained MSD plots. Multiple Molecule Motility Assays—The movements of quantum dot (Qdot) were observed with a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope as described above. Qdot-Pkl1H was prepared by mixing 0.8–8 μm AviTag-Pkl1H (dimer concentration) and 0.16 μm Qdot605-streptavidin conjugate (catalog number Q10101MP; Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature. The sample was then diluted with ∼7 mg/ml casein (C-8032; Sigma) and placed on ice. Oligomeric State of the Pkl1 Proteins—Pkl1 has a predicted coiled-coil region at amino acid residues 196–481, suggesting that the native form of Pkl1 is at least dimeric (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the oligomeric state of Pkl1, the physical properties of full-length Pkl1 (Pkl1F) fused with SNAP tag were analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration analysis. The calculated molecular mass shows that SNAP-Pkl1F forms a dimer in solution (Table 1). Table 1 also shows that both Pkl1H, a HindIII fragment containing the coiled-coil region (8Pidoux A.L. LeDizet M. Cande W.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and GFP-Pkl1H form dimers, and both Pkl1S and GFP-Pkl1S exist as monomers in solution, indicating that a monomeric variant of GFP does not affect the oligomeric state of Pkl1.TABLE 1Oligomeric state of Pkl1 proteins rStokes is the Stokes radius, calculated from the gel filtration data. s20,w is the sedimentation coefficient, estimated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and calculated at 20 °C in water.

We wished to express all constructs in a GFP-fused form, but full-length Pkl1 (Pkl1F) protein was degraded in a variety of host cells and expression conditions (not shown). Therefore, the GFP moiety of GFP-Pkl1F was replaced by SNAP tag that covalently binds a fluorescent substrate, which yielded stable protein capable of being imaged in a single-molecule experiment. GFP-Pkl1H spots were photobleached generally in a one-step or a two-step photobleaching process, whereas GFP-Pkl1S spots were photobleached exclusively in a one-step process (Fig. 2A). The distribution of the fluorescence intensities supports that these spots of GFP-Pkl1H and GFP-Pkl1S correspond to single molecules of Pkl1 dimer and monomer, respectively. Another experiment clearly showed that we were observing single molecules of GFP-Pkl1H dimers; kinesin-GFP, well characterized rat kinesin-1 dimeric construct (amino acids 1–430) fused with GFP, and GFP-Pkl1H were mixed, and then their fluorescence intensities were measured simultaneously on MTs (Fig. 2B). The GFP spots can be readily classified according to their manner of moving along MTs. Two distributions appear to be essentially identical, demonstrating that GFP-Pkl1H is dimeric. The fluorescence intensities of SNAP-Pkl1F spots were also measured (Fig. 2C). It should be noted that the labeling ratio of fluorophore to SNAP-Pkl1F was not very high (15–20%) in this particular case. Since this ratio directly affects the distribution of the fluorescence intensities, the distribution obtained here does not necessarily prove the argument that this protein is dimeric; the data only show that obvious aggregates were not present in our experiment. Collectively, we conclude that SNAP-Pkl1F and GFP-Pkl1H are dimeric, and GFP-Pkl1S is monomeric. MT Gliding Driven by Pkl1—To detect the motility of Pkl1, we first performed an in vitro MT gliding assay (Fig. 3). Unlike in a previous study (8Pidoux A.L. LeDizet M. Cande W.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1639-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), surface-bound Pkl1H molecules supported MT gliding with a maximum average velocity of 33 ± 9 nm/s (mean ± S.D.) in the presence of 5 mm ATP (Fig. 4A and Table 2), demonstrating that Pkl1 is an MT motor protein. The MT gliding velocity of GFP-Pkl1H showed a hyperbolic dependence on ATP concentration with a maximum velocity of 42 ± 4 nm/s and half-maximal activation constant of 1,100 ± 240 μm (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4MT gliding velocity and steady-state ATPase activity.

The active protein kinase migrates slightly slower than the inactive holoenzyme when analyzed by gel filtration, suggesting an expanded conformation. Activation of Pak2 comprises a series of structural changes resulting from caspase cleavage, ATP binding, and autophosphorylation of Pak2. Changes at each step were individually analyzed by amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry and compared with inactive Pak2. The auto-inhibited form was shown to bind ATP in the active site, with minor changes in the glycine loop and the autoinhibitory domain (AID). Caspase cleavage produced significant changes in solvent accessibility in the AID and upper lobe of the catalytic domain. Cleavage of ATP-bound Pak2 relaxes the allosteric inhibition, as shown by increased solvent accessibility in the upper and lower lobes, including the G-helix, facilitating the autophosphorylation of two sites required for activation, Ser-141 in the regulatory domain and Thr-402 in the catalytic domain. Autophosphorylation increased the amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange solvent accessibility of the contact region between the AID and the G-helix, the E-F loop, and the N terminus. Thus, activation of Pak2 via caspase cleavage is associated with structural relaxation of Pak2 that allows for complete auto-phosphorylation, resulting in a more comprehensive solvent-exposed and conformationally dynamic enzyme.

The serine/threonine protein kinase Pak2 (also known as γ-Pak) is transiently activated either in response to moderate stress by Cdc42, or during apoptotic stress by caspase cleavage, followed by autophosphorylation (1Zhao Z.S.

Traugh J.A. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 62: 167-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three enzymes have an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The regulatory domain includes a conserved AID, which interacts with the active-site cleft, and a switch region (83–132) that interacts with the large lobe of the catalytic domain (5Zhao Z.S.

Inactive Pak1 exists in solution as a homodimer, with the AID of each monomer interacting with its partner to inhibit activity (18Parrini M.C. Lei M. Harrison S.C. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because the dimerization domain (residues 79–86 for Pak2) is homologous in Pak1, Pak2, and Pak3 (15Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), it is generally assumed that Pak2 also exists as a trans-autoinhibited homodimer as described for Pak1 (18Parrini M.C. Lei M. Harrison S.C. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Caspase 3 selectively cleaves at Asp-212 in the Pak2 regulatory domain to form two fragments, p27 and p34 (7Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The p27 fragment includes most of the regulatory domain, and the p34 fragment includes the entire catalytic domain and a short segment of the regulatory domain. Pak2 has eight autophosphorylation sites, including seven serines in the regulatory domain and one threonine in the catalytic domain (19Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Pak2 has a basal activity that autophosphorylates five of the serine residues. Following caspase cleavage, additional autophosphorylation at Ser-141 and Thr-402 is required for full activity (7Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J.

Ser-141 regulates the association of Pak2 with Cdc42, and Thr-402 is the conserved threonine in the activation loop of most protein kinases (20Jung J.H. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40025-40031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although no crystal structure for Pak2 is currently available, a crystal structure of two fragments of a Pak1 mutant (K299R), consisting of the AID (residues 70–149), and the catalytic domain (residues 249–545), mimics the inactive conformation (1F3M.PDB) (15Lei M.

A crystal structure (1YHV.PDB) of the catalytic domain of the Pak1 mutant (K299R/T423E) mimics the active conformation (21Lei M. Robinson M.A. Harrison S.C. Structure. 2005; 13: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because the well studied cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) has a bilobal kinase domain homologous to that of Pak1 and a number of resolved crystal structures of active and inactive conformations, PKA (1CTP. PDB) was used as a model to assist in identifying the function of specific amino acids of Pak2 (22Kim C. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Science. 2005; 307: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 23Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F.

The secondary structure of the Pak1 catalytic domain bound to the AID, and the catalytic subunit of PKA bound to the inhibitory region of the pseudosubstrate inhibitor PKI (residues 5–24), are illustrated in Fig. 1. Alignment of the regulatory regions of Pak1 and Pak2 with the catalytic domain of PKA, are in supplemental Fig. S1. The crystal structure of Pak1 shows the AID (residues 136–147) binding to the catalytic domain in the vicinity of the active site. The overlaid structures of Pak1 and PKA show different contact regions for the AID and PKI, respectively, suggesting two different autoinhibitory mechanisms. Autoinhibition would appear to involve a simple occupation of the active site cleft by the AID (21Lei M. Robinson M.A. Harrison S.C. Structure. 2005; 13: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Alternatively, there is the possibility of an allosteric autoinhibitory mechanism similar to that of other protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 and Src (26Hoofnagle A.N. Resing K.A. Goldsmith E.J. Ahn N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). In these studies, the effects of caspase cleavage and autophosphorylation on the structure of Pak2 were analyzed by gel filtration. Conformational changes in the quaternary structure were assessed by measuring solvent accessibility using amide hydrogen-deuterium (H/D) exchange combined with mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). The results show that the heterotetrameric Pak2 remains intact following caspase cleavage and autophosphorylation. The results of the amide H/D exchange define the differences in solvent accessibility at each stage of activation. Autophosphorylation of Pak2 increases the solvent accessibility at the N terminus and the AID of the regulatory domain, and on the E-F loop, the F-G loop, and the G-H loop of the catalytic domain. Autophosphorylation of Pak2 causes rearrangement of the AID and relaxation of autoinhibition. These results suggest activation is a conformationally dynamic state that does not require dissociation of the catalytic and regulatory domains. Materials—Bovine thrombin was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Pepsin immobilized on 6% agarose beads was purchased from Pierce. Deuterium oxide (99.9%) was from Aldrich. ATP, AMP-PCP, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were obtained from Sigma. The α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was re-crystallized and stored in the dark. Expression of Recombinant Pak2 and Caspase 3—The expression and purification of GST-Pak2 (accession number Q29502) from TN5B1–4 insect cells was described previously (7Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R.

His6-tagged caspase 3 was overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified, and the activity was determined (7Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28733-28739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Pak2 Autophosphorylation—To fully phosphorylate Pak2, the protein (20 μl, 12 mg/ml) was cleaved by the addition of 3 units of caspase 3 and incubated at 34 °C for 30 min. The extent of cleavage was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Autophosphorylation of cleaved Pak2 was carried out at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml Pak2 in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm ATP, and incubated at 34 °C for 30 min. Following SDS-PAGE, the level of autophosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP was determined by quantifying the amount of radiolabel incorporated into intact Pak2 and into the p34 and p27 fragments by scintillation counting. Gel Filtration—An ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatograph (Amersham Biosciences) with a Superdex 200 column (1 × 50 cm) was utilized to determine the molecular weight of Pak2. Intact Pak2, caspase-cleaved inactive Pak2, and autophosphorylated caspase-cleaved Pak2 (50–100 μgin100 μl of buffer) were analyzed individually at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a mobile phase of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 125 mm NaCl at pH 7.0. The absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 215 nm. Identification of Pepsin-digested Pak2 Fragments—Pepsin-digested Pak2 (20 μg of Pak2 in 50 μl of 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid) was eluted through a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at pH 2.5, with a linear 100-min gradient of 0 to 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions (400 μl) were collected every 2 min. The fractions were dried with a Speed-Vac (3 h) and resuspended in acetonitrile (5 μl) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (5 μl) at pH 2.5. Each fraction was screened for peptides using MALDI-TOF (PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE STR, PE Biosystems). All fractions containing peptides were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF Ultima-Global and QSTAR XL oMALDI MS/MS, Applied Biosystems) to identify the fragments, based on the primary sequences using Protein Prospector (28Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Measurement of Amide H/D Exchange—H/D exchange was initiated by the addition of 18 μl of buffered D2O (50 mm MOPS, pH 6.98, 125 mm NaCl) to 2 μl of purified intact Pak2 (10 mg/ml) for a final pH of 7.0 at 25 °C. Samples containing nucleotide had a final concentration of 4 mm AMP-PCP or ATP (pH 7.0) and 6 mm MgCl2. H/D exchange was quenched by the addition of 180 μl of ice-cold 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at pH 2.2, which brought the pH to 2.5 in a final volume of 200 μl. For the samples containing nucleotide, 180 μl of ice-cold 0.11% trifluoroacetic acid at pH 2.2 was used to maintain the pH at 2.5 in the quenched condition. The time scale of H/D exchange was 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 min, or 24 h. Six determinations were made at 10 min, and three determinations were made for all other times. An aliquot (100 μl) of each quenched sample was added to 30 μl of activated pepsin-conjugated agarose beads. The digestion was allowed to proceed for 5 min on ice, and the samples were vortexed every 30 s. Digestion was terminated by centrifugation of the sample for 15 s at 12,000 × g at 4 °C to remove pepsin. The samples were rapidly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C for no more than 2 days. The matrix for MALDI-TOF was 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in a 1:1:1 solution of acetonitrile, ethanol, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at pH 2.5 and held at 0 °C. Each sample was partially thawed quickly, and 1 μl of each sample was mixed with 1 μl of matrix and spotted onto a 4 °C MALDI target plate. A moderate vacuum was applied to the plate to dry the spots in 30 s prior to MALDI-TOF analysis. The time between thawing of the sample and spectrum retrieval was ∼3 min. Data Analysis—The Data Explore 4.0 computer program (Applied Biosystems) performed the baseline correction and noise filtration (medium). Each spectrum was calibrated based on the flight times of two sequenced peaks whose calculated undeuterated m/z were 923.45 and 1697.84. Both peaks had high intensity even after the sample was deuterated. The 24-h deuteron incorporation of the most solvent accessible peptide (m/z = 1105.60) was assumed to represent 100% deuteration. The Centroid Application Computer Program (29Mandell J.G. Falick A.M. Komives E.A. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 3987-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) was utilized to calculate the centroids of fragments in the mass spectrum. The incorporated deuteron number was the difference between the centroid of the deuterated and non-deuterated Pak2 peptic peptides. The estimate of deuteron incorporation was corrected for residual deuterium on the side chains (3.3%) and the H/D back exchange (74%). The number of deuterons at time t, D(t), was calculated using Equation 1, D(t)=[m(t)−m(std)](B%)−Ds(t)(Eq. 1) where m(t) is the observed mass at time t, m(std) is the non-deuterated mass. The back exchange ratio (B%) was calculated by the actual incorporated deuteron number at 24 h of H/D exchange divided by all possible exchangeable sites at peptide m/z 1105.60. The Ds(t) is the amount of residual deuterium on the side chains at time t. Solution States of Pak2—The apparent molecular weight of inactive Pak2, caspase-cleaved Pak2, and caspase-cleaved auto-phosphorylated Pak2 was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration to assess the state of association of Pak2 in solution. A schematic of Pak2 is shown in Fig. 2a. Prior to analysis, the Pak2 proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2b). Inactive Pak2 was a single band of 58 kDa. Caspase cleavage of Pak2 was complete and produced two fragments, p27 and p34. Autophosphorylation of cleaved Pak2 was optimal at 7.6 mol/mol. The migration of autophosphorylated p27 and p34 overlapped on the protein gel due to retarded migration of the fully phosphorylated p27 fragment at seven sites. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the state of association of Pak2, as shown in the elution profiles in Fig. 2c. Intact Pak2 eluted primarily as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 115 ± 1 kDa, which was twice the monomeric molecular mass (58 kDa). This was similar to data obtained for Pak1, showing it existed in solution as a homodimer (15Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Caspase-cleaved Pak2, consisting of two 27- and 34-kDa fragments, eluted as a single peak at the same volume as intact Pak2 (116 ± 1 kDa), indicating non-phosphorylated caspase-cleaved Pak2 remained as a compact complex. After autophosphorylation, caspase-cleaved Pak2 eluted primarily as a single larger peak (133 ± 3 kDa), indicating autophosphorylation at eight sites left the heterotetrameric complex intact, but suggesting alterations in the quaternary structure. Identification of the Pepsin-digested Fragments—Pepsin-digested peptides were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column; a total of 40 fractions was collected and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS/MS and oMALDI MS/MS) to determine the sequences of the peptic fragments. The entire mass spectrum of pepsin-digested Pak2 is shown in Fig. 3a. 30 of 42 identified peptides had m/z ratios that were sufficiently different from one another and of sufficient magnitude to use in the amide H/D exchange experiments discussed below. These peptides covered 50% of the primary sequence of Pak2, including all or part of the following regions: the N-terminal region, dimerization domain, AID, glycine-rich loop, C helix, catalytic loop, magnesium-positioning loop, activation loop, and regions without an identified function. Amide H/D Exchange Analysis—To determine the solvent accessibility of the peptides of Pak2, amide H/D exchange experiments were carried out at specific intervals between 0 and 10 min at 25 °C, and the level of deuterium incorporated into the peptides was quantified. For example, the time course of deuterium incorporation into the peak m/z 1697.85 of intact inactive Pak2 was composed of multiple isotopic peaks as shown by the shift of the mass envelope over time (Fig. 3b). At 10 min post deuterium, four deuterons were incorporated into the 11 available amides, and the level of deuterium incorporation reached a plateau, suggesting saturation of the fast-exchange amide sites (Fig. 3c). The plots of deuterium incorporation for the remainder of the peptides are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Because 28 of 30 peptides reached the plateau of deuterium incorporation, the 10-min time point was used as a measure of relative amide H/D exchange. The time course of deuterium incorporation was a combination of multiple-exchange functions. Interestingly, some of the data showed a single class of observed rate constants while others consisted of both a fast and a slow process. These observations were expected, because multiple deuterium atoms were incorporated into the peptides and the rate of each H/D exchange was different from the others. To study the structural changes caused by nucleotide binding, caspase cleavage, and autophosphorylation, amide H/D exchange experiments were performed with five samples: intact Pak2 and caspase-cleaved Pak2 in the presence and absence of AMP-PCP, and cleaved autophosphorylated Pak2. The deuterons incorporated into the peptic fragments of Pak2 after 10 min of amide H/D exchange were measured for all five of the Pak2 samples, and the data for the individual treatments were calculated and compared with that of intact Pak2 (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of H/D exchange data for Pak2Pak2 residuesStructural domainsNo. amidesDeuterons exchanged in 10 minaThe number of deuterons is the average of six replicates with standard deviationPak2AMP-PCPCaspase-cleavedCaspase-cleaved; AMP-PCPCleaved and autophosphorylatedm/z–5–17 (2303.11)Pro1179.8 ± 1.711.1 ± 0.710.6 ± 1.713.0 ± 0.515.3 ± 0.68–17 (1105.60)Pro154.0 ± 0.34.7 ± 0.44.8 ± 0.45.3 ± 0.45.2 ± 0.358–79 (2414.25)To CRIB185.2 ± 1.26.3 ± 0.96.2 ± 1.06.4 ± 0.65.5 ± 0.180–88 (1086.54)Di domain/CRIB82.5 ± 0.42.8 ± 0.32.9 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.180–89 (1201.56)Di domain/CRIB93.1 ± 0.63.6 ± 0.34.0 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.1102–105 (545.32)AID31.3 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.1106–124 (2153.23)AID177.6 ± 1.09.2 ± 0.610.1 ± 0.511.1 ± 0.211.9 ± 0.6239–252 (1667.95)β-sheet 1127.2 ± 0.87.7 ± 0.57.4 ± 0.57.6 ± 0.27.6 ± 0.4239–264 (2842.55)β1 to Gly loop2411.9 ± 1.413.6 ± 1.113.6 ± 1.014.1 ± 0.514.6 ± 0.6242–264 (2543.36)β1 to Gly loop218.7 ± 1.510.0 ± 1.510.8 ± 0.812.5 ± 0.612.9 ± 0.4283–294 (1467.85)Loop to C-helix103.2 ± 0.53.8 ± 0.33.8 ± 0.64.2 ± 0.34.3 ± 0.2295–309 (1772.01)C-helix to loop134.4 ± 0.34.6 ± 0.45.6 ± 0.35.1 ± 0.34.6 ± 0.2297–309 (1545.85)C-helix to loop112.0 ± 0.32.5 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.42.7 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.3357–375 (2248.18)Cat. loop181.8 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.1358–375 (2119.14)Cat. loop171.6 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.1360–375 (1858.99)Cat. loop151.4 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.2362–375 (1650.89)Cat. loop131.4 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.1364–375 (1408.79)Cat. loop110.8 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1376–389 (1500.74)Mg loop133.6 ± 0.43.5 ± 0.83.2 ± 0.73.6 ± 0.53.6 ± 0.4381–389 (1013.53)Mg loop81.4 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.42.5 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.1390–403 (1579.76)Act. loop126.3 ± 0.96.9 ± 0.57.2 ± 0.77.3 ± 0.7NDbND, not detected391–403 (1476.75)Act. loop115.0 ± 0.95.2 ± 0.86.1 ± 0.74.6 ± 0.2ND417–429 (1532.86)E-F helix loop113.4 ± 0.94.1 ± 0.63.7 ± 0.73.8 ± 0.44.7 ± 0.5436–451 (1828.89)F-G helix loop124.7 ± 0.25.3 ± 0.35.4 ± 0.36.1 ± 0.36.9 ± 0.1437–451 (1697.85)F-G helix loop114.0 ± 0.24.4 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.25.2 ± 0.15.8 ± 0.1455–473 (2069.09)G-H helix loop157.2 ± 0.47.9 ± 0.28.0 ± 0.58.9 ± 0.19.5 ± 0.3474–480 (923.45)H-helix60.1 ± 0.10.0 ± 0.10.0 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.1484–500 (1967.07)Loop to I helix153.4 ± 0.43.9 ± 0.33.7 ± 0.44.3 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.2485–500 (1852.04)Loop to I helix142.2 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.02.7 ± 0.1501–514 (1511.92)C-terminal114.8 ± 0.45.6 ± 0.25.5 ± 0.35.9 ± 0.15.8 ± 0.3a The number of deuterons is the average of six replicates with standard deviationb ND, not detected Open table in a new tab The Pak2 samples were subjected to a two-way analysis of variance analysis followed by a multiple-paired comparison analysis using the Prism 4 computer program.

https://openalex.org/W2165067411,"Senescence is one of the main barriers against tumor progression. Oncogenic signals in primary cells result in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), crucial for protection against cancer development. It has been described in premalignant lesions that OIS requires DNA damage response (DDR) activation, safeguard of the integrity of the genome. Here we demonstrate how the cellular mechanisms involved in oncogenic transformation in a model of glioma uncouple OIS and DDR. We use this tumor type as a paradigm of oncogenic transformation. In human gliomas most of the genetic alterations that have been previously identified result in abnormal activation of cell growth signaling pathways and deregulation of cell cycle, features recapitulated in our model by oncogenic Ras expression and retinoblastoma (Rb) inactivation respectively. In this scenario, the absence of pRb confers a proliferative advantage and activates DDR to a greater extent in a DNA lesion-independent fashion than cells that express only HRasV12. Moreover, Rb loss inactivates the stress kinase DDR-associated p38MAPK by specific Wip1-dependent dephosphorylation. Thus, Rb loss acts as a switch mediating the transition between premalignant lesions and cancer through DDR modulation. These findings may have important implications for the understanding the biology of gliomas and anticipate a new target, Wip1 phosphatase, for novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2055383398,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the presence of MDD symptoms in patients with CVD is associated with a higher incidence of cardiac complications following acute myocardial infarction (MI). Stress-hemoconcentration, a result of psychological stress that might be a risk factor for the pathogenesis of CVD, has been studied in stress-challenge paradigms but has not been systematically studied in MDD.Secondary analysis of stress hemoconcentration was performed on data from controls and subjects with mild to moderate MDD participating in an ongoing pharmacogenetic study of antidepressant treatment response to desipramine or fluoxetine. Hematologic and hemorheologic measures of stress-hemoconcentration included blood cell counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin, total serum protein, and albumin, and whole blood viscosity.Subjects with mild to moderate MDD had significantly increased hemorheologic measures of stress-hemoconcentration and blood viscosity when compared to controls; these measures were correlated with depression severity. Measures of stress-hemoconcentration improved significantly after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Improvements in white blood cell count, red blood cell measures and plasma volume were correlated with decreased severity of depression.Our secondary data analyses support that stress-hemoconcentration, possibly caused by decrements in plasma volume during psychological stress, is present in Mexican-American subjects with mild to moderate MDD at non-challenged baseline conditions. We also found that after antidepressant treatment hemorheologic measures of stress-hemoconcentration are improved and are correlated with improvement of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that antidepressant treatment may have a positive impact in CVD by ameliorating increased blood viscosity. Physicians should be aware of the potential impact of measures of hemoconcentration and consider the implications for cardiovascular risk in depressed patients."

LpxE belongs to the family of lipid phosphate phosphatases that contain a tripartite active site motif and six predicted transmembrane helices. Here we report the purification and characterization of R. leguminosarum LpxE. A modified lpxE gene, encoding a protein with an N-terminal His6 tag, was expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was solubilized with Triton X-100 and purified to near-homogeneity. Gel electrophoresis reveals a molecular weight consistent with the predicted 31 kDa. LpxE activity is dependent upon Triton X-100, optimal near pH 6.5, and Mg2+-independent. The H197A and R133A substitutions inactivate LpxE, as does treatment with diethyl pyrocarbonate. In a mixed micelle assay system, the apparent Km for the precursor lipid IVA is 11 μm. Substrates containing the 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid disaccharide are dephosphorylated at similar rates to lipid IVA, whereas glycerophospholipids like phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylglycerol phosphate are very poor substrates. However, an LpxE homologue present in Agrobacterium tumefaciens is selective for phosphatidylglycerol phosphate, demonstrating the importance of determining substrate specificity before assigning the functions of LpxE-related proteins.

The type 2 enzymes in this family are usually magnesium-independent and share a tripartite sequence motif (Fig. 1, panel A), which is involved in the binding and hydrolysis of the phosphate moiety of the substrate (34Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Most of the type 2 phosphatases are integral membrane proteins with six predicted transmembrane segments (35Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). No high resolution x-ray crystal structures or NMR structures of these membrane proteins have been reported. The type 2 phosphatases dephosphorylate diverse lipids, including phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP), phosphatidic acid (PA), sphingosine phosphate, and lysophosphatidic acid (35Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 36Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol.

R. leguminosarum LpxE was the first enzyme identified in this family that is selective for the 1-phosphate group of lipid A (31Karbarz M.J. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39269-39279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similar lipid A 1-phosphatases were later identified in F. novicida (32Wang X. Karbarz M.J.

In cells, the dephosphorylation of lipid A by F. novicida and H. pylori LpxE is dependent upon the inner membrane flippase MsbA, indicating that the active sites of these LpxE orthologues face the periplasm (24Tran A.X.

Given the importance of the phosphate groups of lipid A for its bioactivity and the need for structural studies of the lipid phosphate phosphatases, we now report the purification to near-homogeneity of a His6-tagged derivative of R. leguminosarum LpxE. The purified enzyme is a highly selective lipid A 1-phosphatase (Fig. 2), with less than 1% activity against various glycerophospholipid substrates under matched assay conditions, and no detectable cleavage of the 4′-phosphate moiety of lipid A. Our chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis data demonstrate that the catalytic mechanism of LpxE is similar to that of other members of the lipid phosphate phosphatase family (34Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 35Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).

All cells and extract preparations were performed at 0–4 °C in the same manner as described below for E. coli. PCR Amplification and Cloning of A. tumefaciens C58 lpxE—The A. tumefaciens (AtLpxE) homologue of R. leguminosarum lpxE was PCR-amplified and subcloned from A. tumefaciens C58 genomic DNA. Genomic DNA was prepared from 0.5 ml of cells using the Easy-DNA genomic preparation kit from Invitrogen. AtLpxE was amplified by PCR followed by ligation into the pET-28a expression vector to yield the plasmid, pAtLpxE. The primers and PCR conditions are described in the supplementary material. The plasmid was then transformed into Novablue(DE3) for overexpression of the protein. First, a repurified single colony of E. coli containing pAtLpxE was inoculated into 20 ml of LB containing kanamycin (12 μg/ml) and grown in a rotary shaker at 37 °C to an A600 of 1.0. The culture was then used to inoculate 500 ml of fresh LB containing kanamycin (12 μg/ml), and when A600 reached 0.6, the culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h.

Alternatively, Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was prepared directly from the disaccharide 1-phosphate precursor and [γ-32P]ATP without purification of the [4′-32P]lipid IVA. After the Kdo transferase reaction was completed, 90–95% of the [γ-32P]ATP was incorporated into the Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, as judged by analytical TLC and analysis with a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). The pure, dry Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was resuspended by sonic irradiation for 60 s in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA, and the tube was stored at -20 °C. The typical yield of Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (specific activity ∼ 8 μCi/nmol) following these extractions was 50–60% of the input [γ-32P]ATP. 32P-Lipid X (Fig. 2) was prepared from 32Pi-labeled cells of E. coli MN7, as described previously (49Nishijima M.

The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mg/ml LpcC membrane protein and 10 mm guanosine-5′-diphosphate mannose. It was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min, and the membranes were then inactivated by heating to 65 °C for 10 min. To test the mannosyl-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA as a substrate for the lipid A 1-phosphatase, purified LpxE was added to the same reaction tube without purification of the mannosyl-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA. Lauroyl-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (Fig. 2) was synthesized from Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA using the Kdo-dependent lauroyltransferase (LpxL) of E. coli in membranes of Novablue(DE3)/pLpxL (24Tran A.X.

The reaction conditions for the lauroyltransferase were as follows: 0.2 mg/ml Novablue(DE3)/pLpxL membranes, 10 μm Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (20,000 cpm/nmol), lauroyl-acyl carrier protein (30 μm), 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min, and then the LpxL membranes were inactivated by heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The heat-inactivated mixture was then tested directly as the substrate for the LpxE 1-phosphatase without purification. Dilauroyl-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (Fig. 2) was prepared as described by Reynolds et al. (52Reynolds C.M. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

LpxE 1-Phosphatase Assay—The lipid A 1-phosphatase LpxE was assayed unless otherwise indicated with the tetra-acylated lipid A precursor, [4′-32P]lipid IVA, which was stored frozen as an aqueous dispersion. Prior to use, the [4′-32P]lipid IVA substrate was subjected to ultrasonic irradiation in a bath apparatus for 1 min. The 1-phosphatase reaction mixture (10 μl final volume, unless indicated otherwise) contained 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 μm [4′-32P]lipid IVA (3000–6000 cpm/nmol). The reaction was started by addition of an appropriate amount of enzyme (0.01 mg/ml of pure enzyme or about 0.1 mg/ml of solubilized E. coli membranes obtained from cells overexpressing lpxE behind the T7lac promoter) and incubated for various times at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by spotting 4-μl samples directly onto a silica gel TLC plate. After drying at room temperature, the plate was developed in the solvent chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, H2O (50:50:16:5, v/v).

The deposition of fibrils and amorphous aggregates of TTR in patients' tissues is a hallmark of TTR amyloid disease. Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy is a hereditary form of TTR amyloidosis that is associated with one among 80 different variants of TTR. The most aggressive variants of TTR are V30M, L55P, and A25T, and the propensity to undergo aggregation seems to be linked to tetramer stability. T119M is a very stable, non-amyloidogenic variant of TTR. Here we show that the combination of high hydrostatic pressure with subdenaturing concentrations of urea (4 m) at 1 °C irreversibly dissociates T119M into monomers in less than 30 min in a concentration-dependent fashion. After pressure and urea removal, long lived monomers are the only species present in solution. We took advantage of the slow reassociation kinetics of these monomers into tetramers to produce heterotetramers by mixing the T119M monomers with the tetramers of the aggressive mutants of TTR. Our data show that T119M monomers can be successfully incorporated into all of these tetramers even when the exchange is performed in a more physiological environment such as human plasma; these monomers render the resultant heterotetramers less amyloidogenic. The data presented here are relevant for the understanding of T119M folding and association reactions and provide a protocol for producing T119M monomers that function as inhibitors of TTR aggregation when incorporated in to tetramers. This protocol may provide a new strategy for treating TTR diseases for which there is no therapy available other than liver transplantation.

Benson M.D. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1491-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). TTR is found in human plasma (0.1–0.4 mg/ml) and cerebral spinal fluid (0.017 mg/ml). The plasma form serves as a secondary carrier for thyroxine (T4) and binds to retinol-binding protein (1Hamilton J.A. Benson M.D. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1491-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), whereas the form that resides in the cerebral spinal fluid is the primary T4 transporter (2Schreiber G. Southwell B.R. Richardson S.J. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1995; 103: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Wild-type TTR is responsible for senile systemic amyloidosis, a disease that affects 10% of people over 80 years old and is characterized by heavy amyloid deposits in the heart (3Westermark P.K. Johansson B. Cornwell G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2843-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Around 80 point mutants of TTR have been described thus far that are involved in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, and central nervous system amyloidosis (4Connors L.H. Lim A. Prokaeva T. Roskens V.A. Costello C.E. Amyloid. 2003; 10: 160-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In general, patients with the familial form of the disease experience the first symptoms by the time they reach their second or third decade with peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and leptomeningeal deposition (5Sousa M.M. Saraiva M.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2003; 71: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Among the variants of TTR identified worldwide, V30M and L55P are the most important because of their high frequency of occurrence and the aggressiveness of the symptoms they evoke. A25T is one of the most unstable known tetramer of TTR that is involved in central nervous system amyloidosis (6Sekijima Y. Hammarstrom P. Matsumura M. Shimizu Y. Iwata M. Tokuda T. Ikeda S. Kelly J.W. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The non-amyloidogenic variant T119M has been described as an interallelic trans-suppressor variant in compound heterozygotes and has a high frequency of occurrence in the Portuguese population. In heterozygotic individuals, this variant, which forms a highly stable tetramer (7Hammarstrom P. Jiang X. Hurshman A.R. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16427-16432Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), ameliorates the effects of the pathogenic mutation, reducing the severity of the symptoms (8Coelho T. Carvalho M. Saraiva M.J. Alves I. Almeida M.R. Costa P.P. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 20: 179Google Scholar, 9Sebastiao M.P. Lamzin V. Saraiva M.J. Damas A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This variant also presents an enhanced T4 binding capacity. X-ray crystallography studies have revealed that the substitution of methionine for threonine at position 119, a residue located in the T4-binding channel, allows for closer contact between the hormone and the protein and, therefore, the increased T4 binding affinity of T119M (9Sebastiao M.P. Lamzin V. Saraiva M.J. Damas A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Almeida M.R. Damas A.M. Lans M.C. Brouwer A. Saraiva M.J. Endocrine. 1997; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Additionally T119M carriers have higher TTR serum levels because of the slow clearance rate of this variant from serum in contrast to V30M, which is cleared even faster than the wild-type protein (11Alves I.L. Hays M.T. Saraiva M.J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several studies have identified the major contributions of single amino acid substitutions on the thermodynamic stability, rate of tetramer dissociation, and amyloidogenicity of TTR (12Mccutchen S.L.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16427-16432Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) observed that T119M dissociates 40-fold slower and reassembles 90–200-fold slower than the wt TTR. These slow rates of folding and unfolding allow the protein to be very stable and resist high urea concentrations for long periods of time. For example, after 96 h of incubation in the presence of 8 m urea, only 40% of the population of T119M tetramers dissociate into monomers (7Hammarstrom P. Jiang X. Hurshman A.R. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16427-16432Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This high thermodynamic stability displayed by T119M tetramers has been used to explain why this variant protects against FAP disease: the formation of an amyloidogenic species, be it a monomer (15Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8654-8660Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), a dimer (16Olofsson A. Ippel H.J. Baranov V. Horstedt P. Wijmenga S. Lundgren E. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 306: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) resolved the atomic structure of T119M unbound and bound to T4 by x-ray analyses. It was clear from their data that the enhanced structural stability displayed by T119M is mainly due to new H-bonds within each monomer and between the monomers as well as to changes in the overall protein conformation that are provoked by Met-119, which extends into the T4-binding channel. No major structural changes, however, were observed in the structure of T119M that could explain its diminished amyloidogenicity. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) has been used successfully to denature and dissociate proteins, protein-DNA complexes, virus particles (20Silva J.L. Lima L.M.T.R. Foguel D. Cordeiro Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 132-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and, more recently, protein aggregates and amyloid fibrils (21Foguel D. Suarez M.C. Ferrao-Gonzales A.D. Porto T.C.R. Palmieri L. Einsiedler C.M. Andrade L.R. Lashuel H.A. Lansbury P.T. Kelly J.W. Silva J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9831-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown recently that after a cycle of compression-decompression, wt and variants of TTR (L55P and V30M) form fibrils under mild conditions (pH 5–5.6 at 37 °C). At 1 °C, the main species that is recovered after a cycle of compression-decompression is the tetramer of TTR; these tetramers are less stable than the native, non-pressurized TTR. This altered tetramer is called T4* and is thought to represent a preaggregate state of TTR (17Ferrao-Gonzales A.D. Souto S.O. Silva J.L. Foguel D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6445-6450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In these studies (18Ferrao-Gonzales A.D. Palmieri L. Valory M. Silva J.L. Lashuel H. Kelly J.W. Foguel D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 963-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), even when low temperature (1 °C) was combined with HHP, we did not notice any dissociation of T119M, confirming its high thermodynamic stability as described previously (22Quintas A. Saraiva M.J.M. Brito R.M.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, we combined HHP with subdenaturing concentrations of urea to facilitate the dissociation of T119M into monomers, and then after decompression and urea dilution, folded monomers were recovered. T119M monomers presented a thermodynamic stability similar to that of the wt monomer, suggesting that most of the differences in stability between the tetramers of T119M and wt TTR can be attributed to the intersubunit contacts inside the tetramers and not to the intrasubunit contacts of the monomers. Our data also show that T119M monomers can be successfully incorporated into amyloidogenic tetramers even when the exchange is performed in a more physiological environment, such as the plasma; these monomers render the resultant heterotetramers less amyloidogenic. The data presented here are relevant for understanding the T119M folding and association reactions and provide a protocol for producing stable T119M monomers that function as inhibitors of TTR aggregation when incorporated into tetramers; this protocol may be a new strategy for treating TTR diseases. Chemicals—All reagents were of analytical grade. Bis(8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate) (bis-ANS) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 2-[(3,5-Dichlorophenyl)amino]benzoic acid (VBO) (23Oza V.B. Smith C. Raman P. Koepf E.K. Lashuel H.A. Petrassi H.M. Chiang K.P. Powers E.T. Sachettinni J. Kelly J.W. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), an analog of diclofenac, was dissolved in DMSO to yield a stock solution of 2 mm. Distilled water was filtered and deionized through a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The high pressure experiments were performed in the following buffer: 50 mm MES, 100 mm KCl, pH 5.0 (buffer A). Urea, when necessary, was added to this buffer. The experiments performed at pH 7.0 were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl (buffer B). We emphasize that MES and Tris buffers were chosen for the pressure experiments because their pH does not change significantly under high pressure. The ΔV for the protonic ionization of MES and Tris is positive and equal to 3.9 and 4.3 cm3/mol, respectively (24Kitamura Y. Itoh T. J. Solut. Chem. 1987; 16: 715-725Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Recombinant wt TTR, A25T, V30M, L55P, monomer of wt TTR (M-TTR), and T119M were expressed and purified as described previously (25Lai Z.H. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 7.76 × 104m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm. The engineered M-TTR has already been described (26Jiang X. Smith C.S. Petrassi H.M. Hammarstrom P. White J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11442-11452Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); it has two point mutations (F87M and L110M) that prevent its tetramerization. Spectroscopic Measurements under Pressure—We used a high pressure cell equipped with optical windows that has been described elsewhere (27Paladini A.A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar); it was purchased from ISS Inc. (Champaign, IL). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on an ISS K2 spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc.). The kinetic experiments under pressure were performed by increasing the pressure quickly to the mentioned values (in less than 1 min); the spectroscopic measurements were then collected over time. In the experiments where pressure was titrated, pressure was increased in steps of 200 bars. At each step, the sample was allowed to equilibrate for 15–20 min prior to making measurements. The high pressure cell was equipped with a circulating bath, which allowed us to control temperature during compression. Tryptophan emission spectra were obtained by setting the excitation to 280 nm and collecting the emission in the 300–400-nm range. The mean energy of the fluorescence emission at pressure p evaluated by the center of spectral mass 〈νp〉 is given by Equation 1, 〈vp〉=∑viFi/∑Fi(Eq. 1) where Fi is the fluorescence emitted at wavelength νi. The degree of dissociation (α) is related to 〈νp〉 by the expression α=(〈vp〉−〈vi〉)/(〈vi〉−〈vf〉)(Eq. 2) where 〈νi〉 and 〈νf〉 are the initial and final values of the center of spectral mass in nm, respectively, and 〈νp〉 is the center of spectral mass at pressure p. The light scattering increase was measured to evaluate the aggregation of the protein. Light scattering was measured by exciting the samples at 320 nm and collecting the scattered light from 315 to 325 nm. Bis-ANS and VBO spectra were recorded by exciting the sample at 360 and 320 nm and collecting emission from 400 to 600 and from 450 to 600 nm, respectively. The experiments shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 were repeated at least twice, and there was less than 10% discrepancy among them. For experiments shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the error bars represent the S.D. of three independent measurements.FIGURE 2Following dissociation-denaturation of T119M induced by HHP in the presence of 4 m urea at 1 °C by VBO and bis-ANS binding. A, 3 μm T119M was incubated in the presence of 10 μm VBO, a fluorescent probe that binds to the T4-binding channels. When free in solution, VBO has no fluorescence emission, whereas upon protein binding its quantum yield increases considerably (inset, filled squares). Upon compression, the VBO spectral area decreases, suggesting that the T119M tetramers have dissociated. The inset shows the fluorescence emission spectra of VBO at 0 bar (▪), 2,350 bars (○), 2,750 bars (▾), and 3,120 bars (□) and after returning to atmospheric pressure (•, superimposed with □).

A, 8 μm T119M monomers was injected into the HPLC system in a TSK3000 column; only monomers eluting at ∼11 min were observed (gray line). Samples were successively withdrawn and injected in to the HPLC system to monitor tetramer formation (inset, hollow circles) and disappearance of monomer (inset, filled circles). The areas of chromatograms were used to evaluate the percentage of tetramer formation and monomer disappearance.

The monomers of T119M produced by HHP treatment were diluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0, resulting in a solution with 4μm monomers and 0.2 m urea. This solution was compressed in steps at 25 °C, and the center of spectral mass of Trp emission was collected in each pressure value (•). The wt engineered monomer of TTR was diluted at the same conditions and subjected to HHP (▪). From these data and Equation 3, a plot of ln(α/1 – α) versus pressure was constructed, and the folding thermodynamic parameters for the monomers were calculated (inset and Table 1).

A, V30M tetramers (1 μm) were compressed for 60 min at 3,000 bars, 25 °C, and pH 7.0 in the presence of T119M monomers (8 μm monomers) to dissociate V30M tetramers. After pressure was returned to atmospheric levels and mixed tetramers formed, the sample was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h and injected into the HPLC system to purify the tetramers. The concentration of tetramers was adjusted to 3 μm, and this sample was subjected to 3,000 bars for 60 min at pH 5.0 at 37 °C. Finally the sample was decompressed, and the light scattering (LS) was analyzed as a function of time (gray line). With the incorporation of T119M subunits into the tetramers, aggregation was suppressed. As reported previously (18Ferrao-Gonzales A.D. Palmieri L. Valory M. Silva J.L. Lashuel H. Kelly J.W. Foguel D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 963-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), after a cycle of compression-decompression, V30M undergoes fibrillation (3 μm; continuous black line). When 1 μm V30M was compressed in the presence of 2 μm T119M tetramers, however, there was no mixed tetramer formation because of the high resistance of the T119M tetramer to HHP; the aggregation observed is a result of the V30M present in the solution (dotted line). B, T119M monomers (M) or tetramers (T) were incubated at 4 °C for 24 h at pH 7.0 with the amyloidogenic variants A25T (white bars), L55P (gray bars), or V30M (black bars) to allow subunit exchange. Then the pH was dropped to 4.4, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. The extent of aggregation was measured by Congo red binding assays and by the turbidity at 400 nm (not shown because of its similarity with Congo red data). The value obtained for each variant upon allowing it to aggregate alone was taken as 100%. As a control, T119M tetramer (hatched bars) was incubated at pH 4.4 at 37 °C for 72 h. Error bars represent the S.D. of three measurements. a.u., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7T119M trans-suppression can take place in human plasma. 3.5 μm A25T (A and B), L55P (C), and V30M (D) labeled with acrylodan were incubated in human plasma in the absence (lanes 2 and bars 2), in the presence of 28 μm T119M monomers (lanes 3 and bars 3), in the presence of 7 μm T119M tetramers (lanes 4 and bars 4), or in the presence of 7 μm wt TTR (lanes 5 and bars 5) for 24 h at 4 °C to allow for subunit exchange. Then the pH was dropped to 4.4, and the samples were kept at 25 °C for 72 h to allow the proteins to aggregate. The samples from A25T, L55P, and V30M were applied to native gel electrophoresis (A and inset of C and D, respectively), and the bands corresponding to the tetramers were quantified (B, C, and D, respectively). Lane 0 in A shows A25T labeled with acrylodan in its soluble form immediately after its addition into the plasma. Lane 1 in A shows the plasma before the addition of the labeled TTR variants. The strong band observed in this lane corresponds to albumin, which, because of its high concentration in plasma, absorbs UV light. The gels were illuminated with UV light to visualize the acrylodan-labeled TTR variants. Note the persistence of the tetramers in the samples incubated with T119M monomers, suggesting that there was trans-suppression due to heterotetramer formation.

The ΔV is calculated from the slope of the curve, and Ku is the intercept on the y axis. Circular Dichroism Measurements—Circular dichroism measurements were performed in a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) using a 1.0-mm-path length quartz cuvette. The buffer used for circular dichroism measurements was 25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0, with or without 4 m urea. Data were averaged for five scans at a speed of 100 nm/min collected in 0.2-nm steps. The base lines (buffer alone) were subtracted from the corresponding spectra. Fibril Formation—Aggregation was performed by incubating TTR in 20 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.4, at 37 °C for 72 h. Fibrillation of TTR was evaluated by Congo red binding according to Klunk et al. (28Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Briefly the samples were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and incubated with 10 μm Congo red. Then absorbance was recorded at 540 and 477 nm (28Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The increase in absorbance at 400 nm was also used to evaluate the extent of fibril formation (data not shown because of their similarity with Congo red). The HHP protocol to induce fibril formation was also used (17Ferrao-Gonzales A.D. Souto S.O. Silva J.L. Foguel D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The German TUEF project provided the screening population (N = 725), and four tagging SNPs (rs1763527, rs1743966, rs1057293, rs9402571) were investigated. EUGENE2 (N = 827) served as a replication cohort for the detected associations. Finally, the detected associations were validated in the METSIM study, providing 3798 non-diabetic and 659 diabetic (type 2) individuals.Carriers of the minor G allele in rs9402571 had significantly higher C-peptide levels in the 2 h OGTT (+10.8%, p = 0.04; dominant model) and higher AUC(C-Peptide)/AUC(Glc) ratios (+7.5%, p = 0.04) compared to homozygous wild type TT carriers in the screening population. As interaction analysis for BMIxrs9402571 was significant (p = 0.04) for the endpoint insulin secretion, we stratified the TUEF cohort for BMI, using a cut off point of BMI = 25. The effect on insulin secretion only remained significant in lean TUEF participants (BMI< or =25). This finding was replicated in lean EUGENE2 rs9402571 minor allele carriers, who had a significantly higher AUC(Ins)/AUC(Glc) (TT: 226+/-7, XG: 246+/-9; p = 0.019). Accordingly, the METSIM trial revealed a lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes (OR: 0.85; 95%CI: 0.71-1.01; p = 0.065, dominant model) in rs9402571 minor allele carriers.The rs9402571 SGK genotype associates with increased insulin secretion in lean non-diabetic TUEF/EUGENE2 participants and with lower diabetes prevalence in METSIM.

https://openalex.org/W2059182662,"The conserved protein kinase Chk1 is a player in the defense against DNA damage and replication blocks. The current model is that after DNA damage or replication blocks, ATRMec1 phosphorylates Chk1 on the non-catalytic C-terminal domain. However, the mechanism of activation of Chk1 and the function of the Chk1 C terminus in vivo remains largely unknown. In this study we used an in vivo assay to examine the role of the C terminus of Chk1 in the response to DNA damage and replication blocks. The conserved ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites were essential for the checkpoint response to DNA damage and replication blocks in vivo; that is, that mutation of the sites caused lethality when DNA replication was stalled by hydroxyurea. Despite this, loss of the ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites did not change the kinase activity of Chk1 in vitro. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution at an invariant leucine in a conserved domain of the non-catalytic C terminus restored viability to cells expressing the ATRMec1 phosphorylation site-mutated protein and relieved the requirement of an upstream mediator for Chk1 activation. Our findings show that a single amino acid substitution in the C terminus, which could lead to an allosteric change in Chk1, allows it to bypass the requirement of the conserved ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites for checkpoint function. The conserved protein kinase Chk1 is a player in the defense against DNA damage and replication blocks. The current model is that after DNA damage or replication blocks, ATRMec1 phosphorylates Chk1 on the non-catalytic C-terminal domain. However, the mechanism of activation of Chk1 and the function of the Chk1 C terminus in vivo remains largely unknown. In this study we used an in vivo assay to examine the role of the C terminus of Chk1 in the response to DNA damage and replication blocks. The conserved ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites were essential for the checkpoint response to DNA damage and replication blocks in vivo; that is, that mutation of the sites caused lethality when DNA replication was stalled by hydroxyurea. Despite this, loss of the ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites did not change the kinase activity of Chk1 in vitro. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution at an invariant leucine in a conserved domain of the non-catalytic C terminus restored viability to cells expressing the ATRMec1 phosphorylation site-mutated protein and relieved the requirement of an upstream mediator for Chk1 activation. Our findings show that a single amino acid substitution in the C terminus, which could lead to an allosteric change in Chk1, allows it to bypass the requirement of the conserved ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites for checkpoint function. Cell cycle checkpoints coordinate the maintenance of genomic integrity with cell division. The checkpoints that monitor replication fork integrity and DNA damage lesions sensed outside of DNA replication use similar mechanisms, and sometimes some of the same proteins, to delay cell cycle transitions, and in addition play an important role in the stability of replication forks and in DNA repair (1Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 2Branzei D. Foiani M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).The conserved protein kinase Chk1 is a player in the defense against DNA damage and replication blocks in metazoans. Chk1 is activated in budding yeast when damage is sensed outside the context of a replication fork. In this case the checkpoint proteins in addition to the kinase Chk1 and the mediator/signal amplifier protein Rad9 inhibit spindle elongation and chromosome segregation in response to DNA damage sensed in late S or G2. One effector of Chk1 in this response is the securin Pds1, which is stabilized by phosphorylation in response to DNA damage (3Gardner R. Putnam C.W. Weinert T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 4Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 652-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 5Sanchez Y.

Although the Chk1/Rad9 DNA damage checkpoint arm is not required during replication blocks in the budding yeast, we have shown that Chk1 is activated when replication is slowed down by the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). 3The abbreviations used are: HU, hydroxyurea; HA, hemagglutinin; BD, binding domain; AD, activation domain; SpChk1, S. pombe Chk1; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; WT, wild type; 3AQ, A333Q, A356Q, and A382Q.3The abbreviations used are: HU, hydroxyurea; HA, hemagglutinin; BD, binding domain; AD, activation domain; SpChk1, S. pombe Chk1; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; WT, wild type; 3AQ, A333Q, A356Q, and A382Q. We have also shown that cells lacking the checkpoint kinase Dun1 are dependent on the Chk1/Rad9 arm for survival of replication blocks elicited by HU (7Schollaert K. Poisson J.M. Searle J.S.

Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Studies addressing the in vivo roles of mammalian Chk1 have been difficult due to the fact that Chk1 is essential for early development of mouse embryos (9Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, yeast cells lacking Dun1 provide a valuable model to explore the role of Chk1 in vivo in the recovery from replication blocks and the response to DNA damage generated outside of S phase.The Chk1 proteins consist of two primary domains, the well conserved N-terminal kinase domain and the less conserved non-catalytic C-terminal domain (10Palermo C. Hope J.C. Freyer G.A. Rao H. Walworth N.C. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of the Chk1 orthologues are phosphorylated after DNA damage. The C-terminal domain of vertebrate Chk1 has also been suggested to play an inhibitory role in the kinase activity of the protein (12Katsuragi Y. Sagata N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1680-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Kinases are regulated by allosteric changes caused by post-translational modifications, by protein interactions (mitogen-activated protein kinases and protein kinase A (PKA)), by modulating access to substrates via subcellular localization (IκB kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)), and by binding of inhibitors (cyclin-dependent kinases, PKA) (13Cheetham G.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Pellicena P. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

A. 2007; 104: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of activation of Chk1 and the function of the Chk1 C terminus remains largely unknown.We used our in vivo assay in the genetically tractable model system (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and cells lacking Dun1 to examine the role of Chk1 in the response to DNA damage and replication blocks. Using this assay we explored the role of phosphorylation and conserved domains of Chk1 in its regulation. We found that the conserved ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites (equivalent to Ser-317 and Ser-345 in human Chk1) of Chk1 are required for both the response to DNA damage and replication blocks. We also identified residues on the same face of a predicted α-helix in the GD domain of the C terminus of Chk1 that when changed result in a kinase that is constitutively modified in the absence of a checkpoint signal. In particular, a single amino acid substitution at a conserved leucine in the GD domain resulted in a constitutively active kinase that did not require the conserved ATR phosphorylation sites of Chk1 for checkpoint activation and function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChk1 Mutant Alleles—All mutant chk1 alleles were constructed by sequential PCR. The template for both reactions was a plasmid containing the wild-type CHK1. First, a PCR was carried out using a primer containing the desired mutation and a primer upstream of the BamHI in CHK1. This PCR product was then used as a “mega primer” along with a primer from the polylinker for the second PCR. The product of the second PCR was digested with BamHI and SacI and used to replace the corresponding fragment in pML107.1 (5Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), which carries an HA-tagged wild-type CHK1. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing.Yeast Strains—The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strains were generated using standard genetic techniques. Integration of mutant chk1 alleles in cdc13-1 or dun1Δ cells was accomplished by cloning the C-terminal PshAI-SacI fragment of the chk1 alleles into integrating vector pRS406 (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) digested with SmaI-SacI. The resulting partial chk1 constructs were linearized by MfeI and then transformed into a cdc13-1 or dun1Δ strain. Plasmid integration resulted in a genetic exchange at the CHK1 locus consisting of a full-length mutant chk1 allele and a 3′-truncated (nonfunctional) copy of the endogenous wild-type allele. The expected genome changes were confirmed by diagnostic PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion or sequencing.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainsGenotypeSourceY300MATa ade2-1 trp1-1 ura3-1 leu2-3,112 his 3-11,15 can1-100Ref. 26Allen J.B.

To examine sensitivity to HU on plates, serial dilutions of cells were spotted on to yeast extract/peptone/dextrose solid medium containing HU ranging in concentration from 0 to 80 mm, incubated at 30 °C for 3 days, and then photographed. The micro-colony assays were conducted by growing cells in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose at 22 °C overnight and then diluted and plated on prewarmed plates and incubated at 30 °C. After 12–14 h, cells were examined for formation of microcolonies, and the number of cells in each of 50–100 microcolonies was counted for each strain. For Western analysis of the Chk1 shift caused by DNA damage, cells were grown in synthetic complete–Leu medium at 30 °C to log phase, and MMS was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. Cells were then incubated at 30 °C for 2 h before harvest.Western Analysis—Protein extracts from cells expressing HA-CHK1 and 3XHA-PDS1 were prepared as previously described (25Foiani M. Marini F. Gamba D. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), separated on 10% acrylamide, 0.066% bisacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. HA-Chk1 and HA-Pds1 were detected by Western analysis using anti-HA antibody (16B12, Covance, Madison, WI).Two-hybrid Assay—The two-hybrid vectors and host strain of James et al. (17James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used. The CHK1 coding region and its mutant forms were inserted into pGBD-C1 to produce Chk1-Gal4 DNA binding domain (BD) fusion proteins, whereas the RAD9 coding region was inserted into pGAD-C1 to yield a Rad9-Gal4 activation domain (AD) fusion protein. Chk1-BD and Rad9-AD plasmids were co-transformed into strain PJ69-4A, which carries a GAL2-ADE2 reporter gene. Transformants were picked and suspended in media with a starting cell concentration of 2 × 107/ml. A series of 10-fold dilutions were made, and five μl of each dilution was plated on complete minimal medium and on minimal medium lacking adenine. The plates were incubated at 30 °C and photographed after 3–5 days.Kinase Assay—Pulldown and kinase assays were carried out as previously described (5Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), except that the complexes were washed 5 times for 10 min at 4 °C with NETN buffer and once with kinase buffer before carrying out the kinase reaction using 20 μm cold ATP.RESULTSThe ATRMec1/ATMTel1 (S/TQ) Sites of Chk1 Are Required for Its Function in Response to DNA Damage and Replication Blocks—The Chk1 protein consists of two primary domains, the well conserved N-terminal kinase domain and the less conserved non-catalytic C-terminal domain. The current model suggests that in response to DNA damage or replication stress, Chk1 is activated through phosphorylation by ATR/ATM on SQ or TQ motifs on the C-terminal domain. The yeast Chk1 C terminus contains six SQ/TQ sites that could be the phosphorylation targets for the yeast ATR/ATM orthologues, Mec1/Tel1 (Fig. 1). Two of the S/TQ sites, Thr-333 and Thr-382, correspond respectively to the sites, Ser-317 and Ser-345 on mammalian Chk1 known to be phosphorylated in response to DNA damage and replication blocks. Other S/TQ sites in the yeast Chk1 do not seem to be conserved in the mammalian Chk1 proteins.To examine the functional importance of the S/TQ sites of the yeast Chk1, we mutated the CHK1 gene on a plasmid to produce six different chk1 alleles, each conferring alanine substitution of the serine or threonine residue in one of the six S/TQ sites. Although Chk1 is not required for the response to replication blocks by HU in wild-type cells, we have shown that Chk1 is essential in cells that lack Dun1 when grown on HU (7Schollaert K. Poisson J.M. Searle J.S. Scwanekamp J.A. Tomlinson C.R. Sanchez Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4051-4063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, introduced plasmids carrying wild-type CHK1, mutated chk1, or empty vector into chk1Δ dun1Δ cells to determine whether the mutated Chk1 would rescue the lethality of the chk1Δ dun1Δ cells on HU. chk1Δ dun1Δ cells with an empty vector failed to grow on plates containing 50 mm HU, whereas introduction of a plasmid encoding wild-type CHK1 rescued the lethality (Fig. 2A). The chk1Δ dun1Δ cells harboring plasmids encoding the mutated Chk1T333A failed to grow on HU, whereas cells expressing Chk1T321A, Chk1T356A, and Chk1T382A showed an intermediate phenotype on 50 mm HU and failed to grow on plates containing 80 mm HU. Cells expressing Chk1T376A and Chk1S439A grew as well on HU as cells expressing wild-type Chk1. These results indicated that the three TQ sites at Thr-333, Thr-356, and Thr-382 that gave severe to intermediate phenotypes were important for Chk1 function in response to replication blocks by HU. We, therefore, generated a dun1Δ strain in which the chromosomal CHK1 was mutated to confer alanine substitutions on all the three TQ sites at 333, 356, and 382 (3AQ). As expected, the dun1Δ chk1–3AQ cells, like dun1Δchk1Δ cells, failed to grow on plates containing 50 mm HU (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2The conserved ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites on Chk1 are essential for the checkpoint response in vivo. A, plasmids carrying Chk1 mutants with alanine substitution of threonine/serine at one of the six putative ATR Mec1 phosphorylation sites were transformed into dun1Δ chk1Δ cells. Transformants were spotted on plates containing 0 or 50 or 80 mm HU. B, the 3AQ mutant combining three point mutations (T333A, T356A, and T382A) was integrated to the CHK1 locus in dun1Δ cells and tested for HU resistance under the same condition. C, chk1Δ cells harboring plasmids carrying HA-tagged Chk1 phosphorylation sites mutants were treated with 0.1% MMS, and protein extracts were analyzed by Western blots using anti-HA antibody. D, left, plasmids carrying HA-tagged 3AQ mutant were introduced into cdc13-1 chk1Δ cells, and DNA damage was elicited by incubating the cells at the nonpermissive temperature. The mobility shifts of Chk1 and accumulation of Pds1 were monitored by Western blots. Right, the 3AQ mutant was integrated into cdc13-1 cells, and checkpoint function of Chk1 in the resulting strains was evaluated using micro-colony assay. The bars represent the average number of cells per colony from 50 colonies. The experiment was carried out in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the phosphorylation of the mutated Chk1 proteins was compromised in response to DNA damage, chk1Δ cells harboring plasmid-borne HA-tagged Chk1 were treated with MMS, and the Chk1 proteins from these cells were analyzed by Western blotting. The wild-type Chk1 from MMS-treated cells exhibited slower migrating forms, indicating modification of the protein in response to DNA damage induced by MMS. Surprisingly, despite the growth phenotypes observed for some of the SQ/TQ mutants on HU, all single AQ mutant proteins exhibited mobility patterns similar to that of wild-type Chk1, although we observed a reduction in the amount of the slowest migrating form in these mutant proteins. However, the triple mutant, Chk13AQ, did not exhibit the slowest migrating forms that were apparent for the wild-type or single mutant proteins (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that phosphorylation or modification of Chk1 took place at multiple sites in addition to the 3TQ sites.DNA damage sensed outside the context of a replication fork can be mimicked in cells by inactivation of Cdc13, a protein that participates in telomere capping (4Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 652-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Chk1 plays a role in the M-A delay after Cdc13 inactivation; thus, we then investigated the role of the 3TQ sites in the DNA damage checkpoint activated by a lesion in late S/G2 induced by a temperature-sensitive allele of CDC13. Inactivation of Cdc13 in cdc13-1 cells at the nonpermissive temperature causes DNA damage that triggers the M-A checkpoint response, which includes stabilization of the securin Pds1 mediated by Chk1 (4Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 652-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 5Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14361-14366Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding an HA-tagged Chk13AQ was introduced into a temperature-sensitive strain, cdc13-1 chk1Δ, whose chromosomal PDS1 was also tagged with HA. cdc13-1 cells expressing the Chk13AQ-mutated protein failed to accumulate Pds1 when DNA damage was induced, indicating the Chk13AQ protein was not functional in the checkpoint response (Fig. 2D). Checkpoint activation in cdc13-1 strains results in cell cycle delay at the M-A transition which leads to micro-colonies of 2–4 cells (4Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 652-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 5Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of the 3 TQ sites to cell cycle arrest, we generated a cdc13-1 strain in which chk1–3AQ was integrated into its chromosomal locus. We then counted the cells in micro-colonies formed by cdc13-1 cells expressing wild-type CHK1, chk1–3AQv or chk1Δ alleles after triggering the checkpoint via inactivation of Cdc13 at the nonpermissive temperature. As expected, cells expressing wild-type Chk1 formed micro-colonies with only a few cells when grown at the nonpermissive temperature for cdc13-1. In contrast, chk1–3AQ cells had many cells per micro-colony, essentially the same as chk1Δ cells (Fig. 2D). Theses results indicate that the ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites, as defined in the 3AQ mutant, which include Thr-333 and Thr-382 that are conserved in mammalian Chk1, are required for Chk1 function in response to replication blocks and DNA damage sensed in late S/G2.The GD and TKF Domains of Chk1 Mediate Interaction with Rad9 and Are Required for Both the M-A and HU Checkpoint Responses—In addition to the ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites, the C termini of Chk1 proteins have two conserved clusters of amino acids called TRF (TKF in yeast Chk1) and GD domains (11Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To determine the importance of the two domains in Chk1 function, we made two CHK1 deletion mutants, which lacked amino acids (aa) 416–421 (ΔTKF) and aa 496–517 (ΔGD), respectively. dun1Δ and cdc13-1 cells expressing the mutants integrated into the CHK1 loci were examined for their ability to grow on 50 mm HU or to halt the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. The dunΔ chk1-ΔGD cells were unable to grow on 50 mm HU, whereas dun1Δ chk1-ΔTKF cells showed some micro-colonies at higher plating densities after 5 days on HU (Fig. 3A). Both cdc13-1chk1-ΔGD and cdc13-1chk1-ΔTKF failed to elicit the M-A DNA damage checkpoint as shown in the micro-colony assay (Fig. 3C). In addition, both ΔTKF and ΔGD proteins did not generate slower migrating forms when cells were treated with MMS (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the growth and checkpoint phenotypes observed were likely due to absence of Chk1 activation by phosphorylation even though the ATRMec1 sites remained intact in both deletion mutants. We also observed that the Chk1 ΔTKF protein seemed to be unstable as the protein levels of this mutated protein were much lower than that of wild-type protein (Fig. 3B). It is unknown whether the lower protein level contributed to the phenotypes observed for chk1-ΔTKF cells.FIGURE 3The conserved GD and TRF domains in the C terminus of Chk1 are essential for the checkpoint response in vivo. A, the chk1 gene lacking the GD domain (ΔGD) or TKF domain (ΔTKF) was integrated into dun1Δ cells. The resulting strains were evaluated for resistance to replication blocks on 50 mm HU. B, plasmids encoding HA-tagged deletion mutants were introduced into chk1Δ cells. The mobility shifts of Chk1 proteins after MMS treatment were monitored by Western blots. *, cross-reaction signal indicative of the relative amounts of protein loaded. C, the deletion mutants were also integrated into cdc13-1 cells, and their ability to halt the cell cycle was evaluated by micro-colony assay. Numbers for duplicate experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATRMec1 is mediated by an adapter/mediator protein, Rad9, which has been shown to physically interact with Chk1 (5Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). It was formally possible that the ΔTKF and ΔGD Chk1 proteins failed to interact with Rad9 and was, thus, incapable of being activated. To test this, we used a two-hybrid system to examine the interaction between Rad9 and wild-type and mutated Chk1 proteins. Rad9 protein fused to the AD of Gal4 and wild-type or mutated Chk1 proteins fused to the DNA binding domain (BD) of Gal4 were co-expressed in yeast cells carrying an ADE2 reporter. Cells expressing AD-Rad9 and BD-Chk1 grew well on plates lacking adenine, whereas cells expressing AD-Rad9 with an empty BD vector or BD-Chk1 with an empty AD vector did not grow (Fig. 4A), confirming the interaction between Chk1 and Rad9. No growth was observed in cells expressing AD-Rad9 with BD-Chk1 proteins lacking the GD or TKF domains (Fig. 4A), indicating that the GD and TKF domains are important determinants for Chk1-Rad9 interaction. However, single amino acid substitutions of invariant residues in the GD (G503) and TKF (F419) domains did not lead to a loss of interaction with Rad9 (Fig. 4A and see “Discussion”). It should be mentioned that the levels of fused BD-Chk1 deletion proteins were comparable to that of the wild-type BD-Chk1 in the cell (data not shown); hence, the lack of interaction between Rad9 and Chk1 deletion mutants was not due to lower levels of Chk1 mutated proteins. Interestingly, although cells expressing Chk1–3AQ fail to grow on HU and fail in the DNA damage checkpoint (Fig. 2), mutation of the 3TQs had no effect on Chk1 interaction with Rad9 (Fig. 4A). Likewise, the catalytically inactive mutant, Chk1-D142A (5Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), also defective in HU response and checkpoint function (data not shown), exhibited normal interaction with Rad9 (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that residues within the GD and TKF domains of Chk1 but not the ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites nor its kinase activity are necessary for the interaction with Rad9. Studies with Chk1 proteins from other organisms and our studies presented here suggest that the Chk1 C terminus acts to inhibit the catalytic activity of the N terminus. Despite this, we did not observe an interaction between the kinase domain and C-terminal domains using this two-hybrid system (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4The GD and TRF domains but not the ATRMec1 phosphorylation sites on Chk1 are required for interaction with Rad9p. A, two-hybrid reporter cells were co-transformed with a plasmid expressing Rad9 fused to the GAL4 AD and a plasmid carrying wild-type or mutant Chk1 fused to the GAL4 DNA BD. Transformants were spotted in a series of dilutions on the media indicated. Interaction between AD and BD fusion proteins allowed growth on the media lacking adenine. D142A, catalytically inactive mutant. B, the Chk1 N terminus (chk1-NT, 1–304) and the C terminus (chk1-CT, 281–527) were fused to the GAL4 activation and DNA binding"

As model system, we used the Drosophila bristle lineage where at each division N plays a crucial role in fate determination. Using in vivo imaging, we followed this lineage and activated the N-pathway at different moments of the secondary precursor cell cycle. We show that cells are more susceptible to respond to N-signalling during the S-phase. Thus, the period of heightened sensitivity coincided with the period of the S-phase. More importantly, modifications of S-phase temporality induced corresponding changes in the period of the cell's reactivity to N-activation. Moreover, S-phase abolition was correlated with a decrease in the expression of tramtrack, a downstream N-target gene. Finally, N cell responsiveness was modified after changes in chromatin packaging. We suggest that high-order chromatin structures associated with the S-phase create favourable conditions that increase the efficiency of the transcriptional machinery with respect to N-target genes."

https://openalex.org/W1976728406,A VERSATILE method of amino-acid determination is that in which amino-acid solutions are incubated with cupric orthophosphate in suspension. The resulting solution contains copper in proportion to the total molarity of amino-acids and the copper is determined by any suitable method. The methods used have included iodometric titration1 and the use of cupric phosphate labelled with copper-64 followed by the determination of the activity in the supernatant2. The latter method is of particular use for the continuous determination of amino-acids in chromatographic eluates.
