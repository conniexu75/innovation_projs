https://openalex.org/W2025836562,Current knowledge of the world carbon budget is reviewed with special emphasis on the question of whether the biota is a source or a sink for CO/sub 2/. The analysis shows through convergent lines of evidence that the biota is not a sink and may be a source of CO/sub 2/ as large or larger than the fossil fuel source. The issue is important because of the potential that changes in the CO/sub 2/ content of air have for changing climate worldwide. Various analyses suggest that human activities in the near future could release large additional amounts of CO/sub 2/ into the atmosphere with results that are substantially unpredictable.

The muscles of the anterior portion of the uropeltid trunk are larger and thicker than those of the posterior and are further modified by the inclusion of large amounts of myoglobin, numerous mitochondria, and diverse other ultrastructural and enzymatic specializations, which presumably represent adaptations for sustained work loads. The very much thinner, serially homologous, but unmodified musculature of the posterior trunk occupies only a much smaller fraction of the cross-sectional area. This regional modification increases the effectiveness of the posterior body for storing viscera and developing embryos."

These results support arguments for the cultivation of maize at 2450 B.C. in coastal Ecuador."

https://openalex.org/W2007053402,"The San Gregorio-Hosgri fault trend is a component of the San Andreas fault system on which there may have been about 115 kilometers of post-early Miocene right-lateral strike slip. If so, right slip on the San Andreas and San Gregorio-Hosgri faults accounts for most of the movement between the Pacific and North American plates since mid-Miocene time. Furthermore, the magnitude of right slip on a Paleogene proto-San Andreas fault inferred from the present distribution of granitic basement is reduced considerably when Neogene-Recent San Gregorio-Hosgri right slip is taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W1965058966,Regulations to limit the use of trichloroethylene as a degreasing solvent have led to an increased use of the more photochemically inert solvent methyl chloroform as a substitute. Model calculations show that about 15 percent of the methyl chloroform released into the atmosphere will reach the stratosphere. Time scenarios based on past production figures and reasonable projections for future release rates lead to a steady-state ozone depletion due to this solvent about 20 percent as large as those resulting from the continuous release of chlorofluoromethanes at 1973 rates.
https://openalex.org/W1965720742,"Earlier workers have overlooked deep-sea bentonite beds when unraveling the Cenozoic volcanic history of an area. In the North Pacific, identification of Miocene and older volcanic episodes is possible only if both altered (bentonite) and unaltered ash beds are recognized. Our study, which includes bentonite beds, shows that volcanism on the Aleutian Ridge and Kamchatka Peninsula has been cyclic. Volcanic activity seems to have increased every 2.5 x 10(6) years for the past 10 x 10(6) years and every 5.0 x 10(6) years for the time span from 10 to 20 x 10(6) years ago. The middle and late Miocene and the Quaternary were times of greatly increased volcanic activity in the North Pacific and elsewhere around the Pacific Basin. The apparent absence of a volcanic record before the late Miocene at Deep Sea Drilling Project site 192 is the result not of plate motion, as suggested by Stewart and by Ninkovich and Donn, but rather of the diagenesis of ash layers. Major, apparently global volcanic episodes occurred at least twice in the last 20 x 10(6) years. Yet, only one major glacial epoch (the Pleistocene) has occurred. Therefore, even though glaciation coincided with an increase in Quaternary volcanism, the increased volcanism itself may not have been the primary cause of global cooling."
https://openalex.org/W2056249350,"The urogenital system of squamate reptiles is represented by separate, bilaterally symmetrical tracts. Males alternate in their use of the right and left hemipenes. Sensory feedback from the hemipenis and, to a lesser extent, from the ipsilateral testis is important in determining which hemipenis the male will use for mating."
