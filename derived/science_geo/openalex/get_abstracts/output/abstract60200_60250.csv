https://openalex.org/W1560194095,"Abstract Crystalline wheat germ agglutinin was prepared from unprocessed wheat germ by a new purification procedure. Its purity and some of its molecular characteristics were examined by a number of criteria. Sedimentation analysis gave a molecular weight of 17,000 ± 1,000 and a sedimentation coefficient of 2.1 S when determined in 0.05 n HCl. At neutral pH, the agglutinin dimerizes with a molecular weight of around 35,000 and a sedimentation coefficient of 3.6 S. Amino acid analyses indicate that the protein contains a high amount of glycine and half-cystine; none of the latter is present as cysteine. Three times crystallized agglutinin is devoid of neutral sugars. Equilibrium dialysis experiments using N-acetyl-[1-14C]glucosamine indicate that the agglutinin has 2-binding sites for N-acetylglucosamine per mole of the polypeptide chain with a dissociation constant of 7.6 x 10-4 m. This binding is highly specific. The β-1,4 di- and trisaccharides of N-acetylglucosamine showed higher affinities with apparent dissociation constants of 4.9 and 1.2 x 10-5 m, respectively."

No polymorphisms were found among 21 proteins encoded by 24 loci. This uniform homozygosity may be a consequence of fixation of alleles brought about by the decimation of this species by sealers in the last century."

https://openalex.org/W2038558622,"Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is present in mouse olfactory bulbs and nasal olfactory epithelium at concentrations exceeding that previously reported for any brain region of any species. After peripheral deafferentation, carnosine concentrations in the olfactory bulbs decrease to less than 10 percent that of normal, while other amino compounds are unaffected. Carnosine appears to be highly localized to the primary olfactory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1534899055,"Abstract The yolk precursor protein vitellogenin was isolated from plasma of estrogen-treated Xenopus laevis males, and the yolk platelet proteins, lipovitellin and phosvitin, were isolated from oocytes of females previously stimulated with human chorionic gonadoptropin. The molecular weights of the polypeptide chains of vitellogenin and lipovitellin were determined by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and by gel filtration in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Both methods yielded a molecular weight of approximately 200,000 for delipidated, S-carboxymethylated vitellogenin. Lipovitellin consisted of two polypeptide chains, with molecular weights of 31,000 and 120,000 and a 1:1 molar ratio, as shown by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. The smaller subunit appeared to be a phosphoprotein with a phosphate content of about 2%. The heavy subunit contained little or no phosphate. Treatment with guanidine hydrochloride did not dissociate lipovitellin into the two subunits: after gel filtration of delipidated, S-carboxymethylated lipovitellin in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride only one component was observed, with a molecular weight of about 140,000. Electrophoresis of 32P-labeled phosvitin on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels produced two labeled bands with mobilities corresponding to molecular weights of 35,000 and less than 25,000. The total molecular weight of the lipovitellin and phosvitin peptide chains was essentially equal to that of the polypeptide chain of vitellogenin. Vitellogenin incubated with very low concentrations of either trypsin or chymotrypsin dissociated into discrete chains with characteristics very similar to those of the peptide chains present in yolk platelets. The evidence thus supports the view that the vitellogenin precursor is a continuous polypeptide chain which is degraded into specific yolk proteins by proteolytic splitting in regions that are also sensitive to attack by trypsin and chymotrypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1604655986,"Abstract The major in vitro RNA transcripts synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase with T7 and T3 DNA templates have been resolved by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Six discrete size classes of T7 RNAs are found, designated I to VI. The apparent molecular weights, estimated from their electrophoretic mobilities, span a broad range, from 2 x 105 to 5 x 106. At least two minor RNA species, with molecular weights greater than 5 x 106, are also detected. The six major T7 RNA species are synthesized in approximately equimolar amounts, with the exception of species III, which is made in about twice this amount. It is likely that species III is a mixture of two RNAs (IIIa and IIIb) transcribed from separate regions of the T7 genome. Hence, the six major T7 RNA species are tentatively identified with seven late transcription units on the phage chromosome, which are read with equal efficiences. The six (or seven) transcription products are initiated independently with guanosine triphosphate at the 5' terminus, and are elongated at a rate of 230 nucleotides per s under standard in vitro conditions. When T7 RNA polymerase is used to transcribe T3 DNA, a single RNA transcript is found, with a molecular weight similar to that of T7 RNA species III. This suggests an explanation for the reduced rate of T3 RNA synthesis by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro, and implies that T3 promoter sites read by the T3 RNA polymerase are heterogeneous in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1579181700,"Abstract Addition of low concentrations of ATP, but not other nucleoside triphosphates, to fat cells inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation under conditions that measure glucose transport. Basal rates of glucose transport are not inhibited. The inhibition cannot be overcome by increasing the concentration of insulin, and the dose-response relationships indicate no gross alteration in the apparent affinity of the cells for the hormone. The binding of 125I-labeled insulin is not altered by ATP. Under the conditions used, ATP does not alter oxidation by affecting cytoplasmic metabolic processes. The effects of exogenous ATP on glucose transport were confirmed by direct measurements of 3H-labeled 3-O-methyl-d-glucose uptake in isolated fat cells. ATP inhibits the insulin-stimulated but not the basal rate of 3-O-methylglucose transport. The inhibition by ATP is relatively selective since it represents a fall in the apparent affinity for glucose of the insulin-activated component of the glucose transport system. The inhibition can be overcome by high glucose concentrations. The antilipolytic activity of insulin in ATP-treated cells is unaffected while insulin-stimulated transport is markedly depressed; these activities of insulin can thus be dissociated. ATP also inhibits the enhanced rates of glucose transport observed with concanavalin A, wheat germ agglutinin, spermine, spermidine, cysteine, and glutathione, substances that activate the same glucose transport system as insulin. The ouabain-stimulated glucose oxidation, which occurs by mechanisms different from those of insulin, is not affected by ATP. The ATP analog, α,β-methylene-adenosine 5'-triphosphate (Ap(CH2)pp), can mimic the effect of ATP. Another analog, β,γ-methylene-adenosine 5'-triphosphate (App(CH2)p), does not suppress insulin-stimulated transport but it can effectively inhibit the ATP effect; this phosphonic acid analog cannot donate its terminal phosphoryl moiety in phosphorylation reactions. Phloretin, a strong competitive inhibitor of d-glucose transport, can protect the cells from the ATP effect. Phlorizin, another competitive inhibitor, potentiates the effect of ATP. Fat cells exposed to low concentrations (5 to 50 µm) of ATP for a short time (5 min) at 24° continue to exhibit a diminished insulin response (glucose transport) after thorough washing to remove the ATP in the medium. The recovery of insulin sensitivity during subsequent incubation at 37° is slow, pointing to the protracted and relatively irreversible effect of such mild treatment with ATP. Brief treatment of cells with [γ-32P]ATP results in the selective phosphorylation of two plasma membrane components which are estimated to be of molecular weight 16,000 and 22,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylation of the latter is inhibited by phloretin, and phosphorylation of both is inhibited by App(CH2)p. The possibility is entertained that the procedures utilized may selectively label membrane components involved in insulin-mediated glucose transport (glucose carriers). Consideration is given to the possible physiological significance of such selective membrane phosphorylation in the control of insulin sensitivity in normal as well as insulin-resistant states."
https://openalex.org/W1582740266,"Abstract Two phytohemagglutinins (strongly hemagglutinating Maackia amurensis hemagglutinin and strongly mitogenic Maackia amurensis hemagglutinin (MAH and MAM)), which have mitogenic activity against human peripheral lymphocytes, have been purified from the seeds of Maackia amurensis by affinity chromatography on porcine thyroglobulin glycopeptides-Sepharose columns followed by SESephadex chromatography and gel filtration on Sepharose 6B. The preparations were homogeneous by ultracentrifugal analysis and disc electrophoresis, and had s20,w values of 7.1 S (MAH) and 7.4 S (MAM), respectively. The approximate molecular weight of 130,000 was estimated by gel filtration for both hemagglutinins. From chemical analyses these hemagglutinins were found to be glycoproteins and only small differences in chemical composition were found between them. However, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed that MAH is a tetramer of subunits having an approximate molecular weight of 33,000 and MAM is a dimer of disulfide-containing subunits of an approximate molecular weight of 75,000. In hemagglutinating activity, MAH is much stronger than MAM, whereas MAM is a more potent mitogen than MAH. Binding experiments with 125I-labeled hemagglutinins indicate that normal human erythrocytes bind approximately 3.2 x 106 molecules of MAH and 7.8 x 105 molecules of MAM with apparent association constants of 2.9 x 107 m-1 and 1.2 x 107 m-1, respectively, and, furthermore, normal human lymphocytes bind approximately 1.1 x 107 molecules of MAH and 2.4 x 107 molecules of MAM with apparent association constants of 2.1 x 107 m-1 and 1.1 x 107 m-1, respectively. Inhibition assays using various sugars and glycoproteins as hapten inhibitors revealed that these hemagglutinins from M. amurensis seeds differ from each other in their specificities for sugars. Porcine submaxillary mucin (PSM) having blood group H activity was a potent hapten inhibitor against the hemagglutinating activity of MAH. On the other hand, a glycopeptide having N-linked oligosaccharide chains from porcine thyroglobulin was found to be a potent inhibitor of MAM in hemagglutination and mitogenic triggering. Although sequential enzymic degradation of this glycopeptide resulted in a gradual loss of inhibitory activity, the residual core glycopeptide still acted as a potent inhibitor against MAM and even against the mitogenic activity of MAH."
https://openalex.org/W1511183935,"The interaction of the polyene antibiotic filipin with membrane cholesterol inhibits membranous enzyme systems differentially; catecholamine-activated adenylate cyclase in pigeon erythrocyte membranes was already inhibited at a filipin to cholesterol ratio of 0.3:1, while Mg2+-F- activation, phosphorylation of membrane components, ATPase and cyclic 3′ : 5′-AMP-phosphodiesterase activities were either much less inhibited or even enhanced. The binding of catecholamines to the receptor was not affected but the enhancement of catecholamine activation by GTP was even more sensitive to filipin as catecholamine activation itself. The filipin effect could be reversed on incubation of the membranes with β-sitosterol-lecithin vesicles. Another effective uncoupler of catecholamine (and GTP) activation of erythrocyte membrane adenylate cyclase was the amphipathic peptide melittin. The functional consequences of the cholesterol filipin reaction in erythrocyte membranes are heterogeneous. The relevant complex formation was shown not to involve lysis and disintegration and to occur in that part of the membrane which is probed by the hydrophobic dye perylene. The fluorescence of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid which distributes itself in regions which are accessible to aqueous solvents was comparatively little affected. Differences in the degree of polarization of perylene in membranes and cholesterol-lecithin vesicles and of perylene bound to bovine serum albumin suggested that a part of the dye was bound to hydrophobic proteins. Filipin membrane interaction did not change fluorescence polarization of perylene suggesting that the microenvironment was little perturbed."
https://openalex.org/W2075244857,"Most of the lead contained in sedge and voles (mountain meadow mice) within one of the most pristine, remote valleys in the United States is not natural but came from smelter fumes and gasoline exhausts. In a food chain, natural mechanisms do not allow lead to accompany the bulk of the nutritive metals as they proceed to higher trophic levels. This exclusion can be expressed quantitatively by a comparison of lead/calcium ratios at successive trophic levels. This ratio decreased by an overall factor of 200 in proceeding from rock, to soil moisture, to sedge, to vole. This factor would have been 1200 if lead aerosols had not collected on sedge leaves and circtumvented the tendency by sedge to exclude lead from the nutritive metals it absorbed from soil moisture."
https://openalex.org/W1487289865,"Abstract The carbohydrate binding sites of the jack bean lectin, concanavalin A, were studied spectrophotometrically. A number of ligands were examined for their ability to displace the chromogenic ligand p-nitrophenyl α-d-mannopyranoside. It is shown that this technique provides a simple and convenient approach for obtaining association constants for a series of displacing ligands. The data can best be interpreted in terms of a single carbohydrate binding site per monomeric unit for the protein in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1581394639,"A group of inbred mouse strains, typified by C3H/HeJ, have twice as much β-galactosidase activity in their tissues as mice of a second group of strains represented by DBA/2J. In all organs tested, the higher activity in C3H/HeJ is expressed throughout development. The difference in activity is determined by a locus designated β-galactosidase (Bgs) on chromosome 9. The alleles present in C3H/HeJ (Bgsh) and in DBA/LiHa (Bgsd) show additive inheritance. Studies of pH optima, heat lability, intracellular location, and molecular weight of the β-galactosidase activity in crude homogenates suggest that only a single enzyme component is present. Partially purified enzyme preparations from C3H/HeJ and DBA/2J were indistinguishable with respect to heat lability, Km for p-nitrophenylgalactoside, and molecular weight. The presence of a single enzyme component, the absence of detectable structural differences, and the additive inheritance of Bgs alleles suggest that this locus may be either a structural gene duplication or a regulatory site controlling the transcription or translation of a closely linked β-galactosidase structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W1677773489,"Abstract A long chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, which in addition to crotonase is present in pig heart muscle, has been isolated and partially purified. This enzyme appears to be located in the mitochondria and is tighter membrane-bound than crotonase. It catalyzes the hydration of medium and long chain trans-Δ2,3-enoyl-CoA substrates to their corresponding l-3-hydroxy derivatives but it is nearly inactive toward crotonyl-CoA. The highest Vmax was observed with Δ2,3-octenoyl-CoA, while longer chain substrates gave progressively decreasing values. However, the same Km value of 24 µm was obtained for all even numbered Δ2,3-enoic acid derivatives containing 8 to 14 carbons. The pH optimum of this enzyme was found to be 8.5. Inhibition studies showed that this hydratase, in contrast to bovine liver crotonase, is not significantly inhibited by acetoacetyl-CoA but is strongly inhibited by long chain enoylCoA substrates. This inhibition can be at least partially prevented by the presence of bovine serum albumin. The enzyme is also inhibited by sulfhydryl inhibitors, as, for example, p-chloromercuribenzoate or N-methylmaleimide, which at concentrations of 1 mm inhibited the enzyme to the extent of 100% and 69%, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1484681147,"A purification procedure is described for two major toxic proteins from seeds of Abrus precatorius by successive chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-50, carboxymethyl-cellulose, and DEAE-cellulose. The two toxins obtained both appeared homogeneous as judged by electrophoresis and analytical ultracentrifugation. Abrin A, the more positively charged protein obtained from the DEAE-cellulose chromatography, can be crystallized as needles from ammonium sulfate solution by the free interface diffusion technique; under various similar conditions, the other fraction, abrin C, failed to yield crystals. X-ray precession photographs have indicated that abrin A crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell of symmetry P212121 and dimensions a = 74.9, b = 269.8, and c = 70.3 A. The amino acid composition of abrins A and C are different. Molecular weights determined by sedimentation equilibrium are 60,100 for A as compared to 63,800 for C. After A has been treated with 2-mercaptoethanol at 100° for 2 min, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate gives rise to one strong (corresponding to apparent subunit molecular weight of 32,000) and two much weaker bands. This is in sharp contrast with the pattern for C, two bands of approximately equal intensity, corresponding to apparent subunit molecular weights of 33,000 and 28,000. The two proteins also behave differently in affinity chromatography on a Sepharose 4B column. Abrin C at 1 µg per ml concentration level agglutinates sheep erythrocytes, whereas abrin A shows no such activity even at 40 µg per ml concentration level. Abrin C exhibits a more toxic effect on mice than abrin A. These differences in physicochemical and biological properties for the two abrins are presented in detail."

https://openalex.org/W1514587567,"Abstract In crude homogenates of the submaxillary gland of the male mouse, epidermal growth factor activity is found almost entirely in a high molecular weight complex. The complex has a molecular weight of about 74,000 and appears to be composed of 2 molecules of epidermal growth factor (6,045 molecular weight) and 2 molecules of a binding protein (29,300 molecular weight). The complex is stable only in the range of pH 5.0 to 8.0, and its behavior during isoelectric focusing, gel filtration, and ultracentrifugation suggests that it may be in a slow equilibrium with its subunits. In addition, the complex appears to undergo a concentration-dependent aggregation. The biological activity of the high molecular weight complex is proportional to its fractional content of the low molecular weight factor. No evidence was found which indicated that the binding protein might affect the biological activity of the low molecular weight epidermal growth factor. It is postulated that the high molecular weight form of epidermal growth factor is an enzyme-product complex. The substrate is presumed to be the epidermal growth factor precursor which is recognized by a specific arginine esterase, the binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1482760007,"Abstract A solubilized preparation of cat myocardium, which contains adenylate cyclase, has been shown to specifically bind biologically active 125I-glucagon. 125I-glucagon binding was observed over the concentration range 1 x 10-7 to 1 x 10-5 m. Unlabeled glucagon displaced 125I-glucagon over a similar concentration range. The binding specificity of this preparation was also shown by the fact that parathyroid hormone did not bind to cardiac receptor sites in this preparation nor did it displace 125I-glucagon from its binding site. The binding of 125I-glucagon at 37 or 25° is linear for approximately 30 min until maximum binding is reached. In contrast, the activation of adenylate cyclase is maximal within 5 min, indicating the presence of additional glucagon binding sites over and above those required for activation of the enzyme. The binding material was stable at 4° for 4 days and indefinitely when stored in liquid nitrogen. Boiling the binding material for 15 min or incubating it with 1 n HCl for 15 min destroyed most of its glucagon-binding ability. Optimal binding was observed over a broad pH range from 3.6 to 8.5, with a decline above pH 9.0. Preincubation of the binding material with trypsin decreased binding about twothirds. Phospholipases A and C, DNase, RNase, neuraminidase, urea (1 m), GTP, and ATP were without effect on the binding. Solubilized myocardial adenylate cyclase has been shown to have a molecular weight of about 100,000 to 200,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the crude solubilized preparation incubated with 125I-glucagon suggested a molecular weight for the binding fraction of approximately 26,000. Chromatography of the 125I-glucagon-receptor complex on either Sephadex G-100 or Bio-Gel P-30 produced a dissociation of the receptor from catalytic adenylate cyclase activity, which apparently represents a larger molecular weight component (g 100,000). The 125I-glucagon-receptor complex eluted from the gels at an elution volume consistent with the salt peak. However, this eluate was shown by hydrodynamic flow electrophoresis to be neither free glucagon or iodine. Moreover, when it was subjected to electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, the complex had a molecular weight of about 26,000, identical with what was obtained with the crude material. It appeared, therefore, that the complex of glucagon to its receptor had a strong positive charge which resulted in adsorption of the complex to the gel. Following neutralization of the charge-gel interaction by Sephadex and Bio-Gel chromatography of the 125I-glucagon-receptor complex in 0.01 or 0.025 n NaOH, the binding fraction eluted in a more appropriate location for its apparent size. The property of adsorption to Sephadex G-100 and Bio-Gel P-30 may prove useful in purification of the glucagon receptor site."

https://openalex.org/W2165313725,"The circadian rhythm in the level of activity of rat hepatic β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) is characterized by a rapid, 5- to 8-fold increase in activity from the basal level (9 a.m. to 4 p.m.) to a peak at midnight followed by a rapid decrease back to the basal level. In this study actinomycin D, even in high doses (400 µg/100 g), was found to have no effect on the basal enzyme level or on the rate of decline from the peak but did partially suppress the increase. Epinephrine administration during the period of basal or declining enzyme activity elicited a marked increase in reductase activity which could be prevented by concurrent actinomycin D treatment. Administration of cholesterol in corn oil by stomach tube at the time of peak reductase level produced decreases in activity 4 to 8 hours later to levels less than 50% of those in controls given oil alone. Since previous evidence indicates little or no synthesis of reductase during this period in normal rats, these results suggest that cholesterol may be stimulating the rate of breakdown or inactivation of the reductase. Cholesterol administration during the basal level period gave a 50% reduction of enzyme activity 5 hours later. Preliminary results on microsomal-free and esterfied cholesterol indicated that 4 to 7 hours after cholesterol feeding a decrease in microsomal reductase activity was correlated with an increase in the ester fraction. It is at present not clearly established whether an increase in concentration of microsomal cholesterol esters must precede the inhibition of reductase activity brought about by dietary cholesterol."

https://openalex.org/W1537684580,"Abstract A double labeling procedure was employed to determine whether the tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin that are iodinated first are also those that are most readily converted to thyroxine. Goiter thyroglobulin containing less than 1 atom of iodine per molecule was iodinated first with 131I at relatively low levels of iodination (5 to 20 atoms of iodine per molecule) and afterward with 125I at higher levels of iodination (20 to 60 atoms of iodine per molecule). Iodinations were carried out either chemically with I3-, or enzymatically with thyroid peroxidase. Three different sets of conditions were employed for double labeling: (a) first and second iodinations both performed chemically with I3-; (b) first iodination performed chemically, second enzymatically; and (c) both first and second iodinations performed enzymatically. The double enzymatic procedure was used in most experiments. An index of was defined for assessing whether there was preferential use of the first labeled [131I]tyrosyl residues for thyroxine synthesis. Evidence for preferential synthesis was obtained with all the above procedures, but most convincingly when both iodinations were performed enzymatically. When the double enzymatic procedure was applied to casein and fibrinogen, two proteins that were previously shown to form thyroxine upon enzymatic iodination with thyroid peroxidase, no evidence for preferential synthesis was obtained. Similarly, disruption of the native structure of thyroglobulin by exposure to 5 m guanidine resulted in failure to observe preferential synthesis. Preferential synthesis, therefore, is not a general characteristic of all proteins that are capable of forming thyroxine on iodination with thyroid peroxidase. Results of the present investigation support the view that the native structure of thyroglobulin plays an important role in facilitating thyroxine formation. It appears that thyroglobulin contains tyrosyl residues whose function is to form hormone at low levels of iodination."
https://openalex.org/W1594132005,"Abstract Glucokinase from rat liver has been purified over 10,000-fold and appears homogeneous by the criterion of sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The enzymatically active protein represents 0.007 % of the total liver protein and possesses a specific activity of 80 units per mg for purified enzyme. The use of potassium phosphate buffer gradients greatly enhances enzyme resolution during ion-exchange chromatographic procedures. In addition, use of substrate and sulfhydryl protecting reagents in all buffers prevents significant losses of activity. To our knowledge this is the highest degree of purity ever achieved for a mammalian hepatic ATP:d-hexose-6-phosphotransferase. Rat liver glucokinase has been characterized with respect to stability, Km, Vmax, and phosphorylation coefficient toward several substrates as well as behavior in the presence of several inhibitors. Spectral analysis fails to reveal the presence of a prosthetic group. The molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration is 53,000 and 57,000, respectively. The turnover number is calculated to be 4,346 moles of d-glucose phosphorylated by ATP per min per mole of enzyme at 25°."

https://openalex.org/W1543683904,"Abstract The kinetics of oxygen binding to human hemoglobin at pH 7, 0.1 m phosphate, 20°, 2.5 x 10-5 to 10-3 m heme has been investigated by chemical relaxation methods in order to obtain information about the elementary steps and the mechanism of the cooperative process of ligand binding. The temperature jump relaxation method allows the oxygen-binding reaction to be followed over its entire time range. The relaxation process is characterized by two phases which are well separated in time. Both the time constants and the relative amplitudes are dependent on protein and ligand concentration. The two relaxation phases can be understood qualitatively. The fast phase corresponds at low oxygen saturation mainly to the binding of the first ligand molecule and at high saturation mainly to the binding of the last ligand molecule. At intermediate oxygen saturation the fast phase is determined predominantly by the kinetics of both the first and the last step—the intermediate reaction steps do not contribute significantly. The slow relaxation phase involves all elementary binding reactions, but is determined mainly by the kinetics of the intermediate oxygen-binding steps. The relative amplitudes of the fast and the slow relaxation phases reflect strongly the population of the reaction species involved. It is concluded that hemoglobin species with one and three ligands bound must be populated measurably at equilibrium. Reaction models which assume negligible concentrations of these intermediates are therefore not valid. Three reactions have been characterized directly by their kinetic properties: (a) a fast reaction step at low oxygen saturation yielding an apparent off-rate constant of about 1000 s-1 and an apparent on-rate constant (per tetramer) of about 4 x 107 m-1 s-1; (b) a fast reaction step at high oxygen saturation, yielding an apparent on-rate constant of about 4 x 107 m-1 s-1; (c) a slow reaction, which at high oxygen concentration yields an apparent rate constant of 5 x 106 m-1 s-1. It thus appears that the binding of the first oxygen molecule to deoxyhemoglobin is a very rapid process which is characterized by an apparent rate constant as large as that found for the binding of the last oxygen molecule. The low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin arises mainly from the high dissociation rate constant, i.e. short lifetime, of Hb4O2. It cannot be decided if these kinetic properties apply equally to both the α and β chains or if only one type of chain is involved in the fast phase of the relaxation spectrum. A four-step binding model (Adair scheme) explains quantitatively the principal observations of the relaxation kinetics. Adair rate parameters have been obtained which describe the appearance of two relaxation phases only, the ligand concentration dependence (from 0 to 250 µm O2), the protein concentration dependence (from 2 x 10-5 to 10-3 m heme), and the relative and absolute relaxation amplitudes of both phases. The calculated stopped flow kinetic progress curve, using these values, is in agreement with the available data (which are in the saturation range greater than 50%) and predicts a biphasic time course, in contrast to the kinetics of CO-binding. A decision between mechanisms based upon the relaxation kinetics data can be made only with certain assumptions. The values of the Adair-recombination rate constants exclude a mechanism in which there are two very rapidly interconverting structure forms of the protein, each exhibiting equal or nearly equal intrinsic kinetic and equilibrium properties for the four subunits. A concerted mechanism might apply if structure changes are not very fast compared to ligand binding or, if the kinetic properties of the α and β chains are markedly different.

https://openalex.org/W1499029741,"Abstract The effect of 2,3-diphospho-d-glycerate (P2-glycerate) on the kinetic behavior of deoxyhemoglobin generated by the rapid dissociation of gaseous ligand (either by flash photolysis of carbon monoxide hemoglobin (HbCO) or by deoxygenation of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) in the presence of sodium dithionite) is consistent with a stabilization of the tetrameric state of liganded hemoglobin by the organic phosphate. The fraction (α) of rapidly reacting hemoglobin produced by pulsed laser photolysis of phosphate-free HbCO in 0.05 m 2,2'-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2',2''-nitriloethanol-0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0, was independent of CO concentration below about 500 µm, but increased systematically with dilution of the hemoprotein. The apparent tetramer-dimer dissociation constant (Kl4,2) calculated from the dependence of α on [HbCO] was 3.6 ± 1.0 µm in the absence of phosphates and decreased to 1.4 ± 0.3 µm when 1 mm P2-glycerate was added. These values of Kl4,2 are similar to estimates for liganded hemoglobin obtained in sedimentation experiments conducted at pH 7.0 in 0.1 m phosphate (Edelstein, S. J., Rehmer, M. J., Olson, J. S., and Gibson, Q. H. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 4372–4381) and in 0.1 m Tris-0.09 m NaCl (Kellett, G. L. (1971) J. Mol. Biol. 59, 401–424). The magnitude of the Soret absorbance drift accompanying deoxygenation of dilute solutions of HbO2 in the presence of sodium dithionite was decreased by added 1 mm P2-glycerate, and the second order rate constant characterizing the drift phase was increased at 20° from 0.54 ± 0.09 µm-1 s-1 to 1.57 ± 0.18 µm-1 s-1 by the organic phosphate. Since the drift has been shown to result from the formation of deoxy tetramers from deoxy αβ dimers (Kellett, G. L., and Gutfreund, H. (1970) Nature 227, 921–926), this result is also consistent with the proposed phosphate inhibition of dimer formation by liganded hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1484504306,"Abstract The glycine-arginine-rich (f2al) histone from calf thymus was separated into its naturally occurring nonacetylated, monoacetylated and di- and/or triacetylated subfractions. Reconstituted complexes of calf thymus DNA with each of these subfractions were examined by means of circular dichroism. Significant differences in conformational properties were found. With f2al containing e-N-acetyllysine at residue 16, the circular dichroism changes characteristic of nonacetylated f2al-DNA complexes in 0.14 m NaF were nearly abolished. Multiacetylated f2al caused a different type of circular dichroism change when incorporated into complexes with DNA. These observations indicate that the monoacetylated f2al histone is less effective than nonacetylated in producing conformational distortions of DNA, which may be relevant for a mechanism of genetic regulation or for the control of chromatin structure."

These subunits have been studied in six different specificities (HL-A2, HL-A3, HL-A7, HL-A10, HL-A12, and W-27) obtained from normal peripheral lymphocytes and from cultured lymphoblastoid lines. The electrophoretic and chromatographic mobility of the small subunits in a variety of systems was identical, but the large glycoprotein subunits of several specificities could be distinguished by electrophoresis in urea gels at either pH 8.7 or at pH 4.5. It is particularly noteworthy that HL-A7 and W-27 which show a high degree of immunological cross-reactivity were nevertheless distinguishable by electrophoresis at pH 8.7."

Cells deposited in microdroplets under oil were ruptured by freezing and thawing and allowed to react with a fluorogenic substrate. The fluorescence is developed by diffusing an organic base into the droplets and measured in a fluorescence microscope equipped with a photomultiplier.
https://openalex.org/W1552388953,"Brine shrimp are incapable of synthesizing purines de novo and seemingly have a complex nucleotide metabolism involving conversion of stored diguanosine 5′,5″′-(P1, P4-tetraphosphate) into ATP. When nucleosides uniformly labeled with 14C are administered to the organism, its ATP shows an unusual labeling pattern. When [U-14C]adenosine is used as a precursor, the purine moiety is primarily incorporated into ATP, whereas when brine shrimp are exposed to [U-14C]guanosine, the ribose component is preferentially incorporated into ATP. This selective labeling of the purine and ribose moieties of ATP occurs at early time intervals after exposure to the labeled nucleoside, whereas AMP and ADP have [14C]purine to [14C]ribose ratios similar to that of the original nucleoside administered. Thus there appears to be a route from adenosine and guanosine to ATP that does not proceed through AMP and ADP. A pathway is proposed involving the direct participation of diguanosine 5′,5″′-(P1,P4-tetraphosphate) as an intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1591162790,"Phosphorescence spectroscopy has been used to probe the microenvironments of the tryptophan residues of the cyclic antibiotic decapeptides tyrocidine B (which contains a single tryptophan residue) and tyrocidine C (which contains 2 tryptophan residues). Both peptides exhibited two distinct, overlapping tryptophan phosphorescence emission spectra under appropriate solvent conditions. The two emissions had characteristically different wavelength positions, phosphorescence lifetimes, and excitation spectra, and their relative intensities were strongly solvent-dependent. In contrast, an open chain derivative of tyrocidine B, which has no biological activity, showed only a single phosphorescence emission from tryptophan. This indicated that the environmental heterogeneity of tryptophan residues in the intact peptides arose not from their primary structures but from higher structural features. Factors which are known to increase the self-association of the tyrocidines, such as higher peptide concentrations or greater amounts of water in alcohol-water solvent mixtures, generally led to enhanced emission of the lower energy phosphorescence component relative to the higher energy one. We conclude that the higher energy component of the phosphorescence emission comes from solvent-exposed tryptophan residues of monomeric peptide molecules, and the lower energy component from tryptophan residues buried in the hydrophobic interior of peptide aggregates. These cyclic peptides reveal many of the phosphorescence complexities observed with native proteins and thus are useful as model compounds in correlating tryptophan microenvironments with emission characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1486530976,"Abstract A mechanism of proton exchange leading to water proton relaxation is proposed for horse heart metmyoglobin fluoride which is mediated by H2O molecules and involves the distal histidine. The mechanism is based on a comparison of water proton NMR relaxation (T1-1 (H)) in the presence of horse and Aplysia metmyoglobin fluoride; Aplysia metmyoglobin fluoride was chosen for comparison because it lacks the distal histidine. Proton relaxation for horse heart metmyoglobin fluoride has been observed over a pH range of 5.0 to 11.5 in H2O and 95% D2O solutions while simultaneously monitoring the optical absorbance at 542 nm. For horse heart metmyoglobin fluoride, proton relaxation shows three pK values, at pH 6.2, 8, and one at a higher pH, which varies with the fluoride ion concentration due to the equilibrium metmyoglobin fluoride + OH- ⇋ MbOH + F-. Optical spectroscopy shows two pK values, one at pH 6.2 and one above 9. The latter pK has a large deuterium isotope effect in the optical spectrum, but none for proton relaxation. Theorell and Ehrenberg ((1951) Acta Chem. Scand. 5, 823) reported changes in the magnetic susceptibility of metmyoglobin fluoride with pK values of 6.3 and 8.11; however, the magnetic susceptibility increases when T1-1 (H) decreases and vice versa. We therefore conclude that the proton-iron distance changes twice during the titration."
https://openalex.org/W1485504517,"Abstract A soluble enzyme preparation from Pseudomonas sp. NRRL B-3266 catalyzes the interconversion of cis-Δ9-octadecenoic acid (oleic acid), trans-Δ10-octadecenoic acid, and 10-d-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid. Oleic acid and 10-d-hydroxy-octadecanoic acid are directly interconvertible by hydration and dehydration. The cis and trans unsaturated fatty acid isomers are interconvertible by direct isomerization of the double bond. trans-Δ10-Octadecenoic and 10-d-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid do not undergo direct interconversion without the intermediate formation of (enzyme-bound) oleic acid. Both hydration and isomerization reactions are very specific for a cis-Δ9 double bond, but the isomerization reaction is much more sensitive to changes in the hydrocarbon tail of the substrate distal to the double bond. The isomerization proceeds stereospecifically, with the 11-l (Pro-R) hydrogen of oleic acid being removed and a hydrogen from the medium being added at carbon 9 in the l (Pro-R) configuration. In the reverse reaction the 9-l (Pro-R) hydrogen is removed and a hydrogen from the medium is added at carbon 11. Primary kinetic isotope effects are seen for the removal of the 9-l and 11-l hydrogens. There is a marked discrimination against tritium in the addition of the 11-l hydrogen from the medium. The hydration of oleic acid and the isomerization of trans-Δ10-octadecenoic acid to oleic acid proceed more slowly in highly enriched 2H2O than in H2O, but the isomerization of oleic acid to trans-Δ10-octadecenoic acid is slightly faster in 2H2O."

This is the first unprotonated adenine polynucleotide shown to have such a structure. The helix is probably double-stranded and exhibits a dependence of Tm on [Na+] similar to those of most heteroduplex structures. The new polymer fails to interact with either poly(U) or poly(BrU). The infrared spectrum of poly(8BrA) exhibits a striking 15 cm-1 splitting of the 1625 cm-1 ring vibration, not previously observed in other adenine polynucleotides. We interpret this splitting as evidence that the polymer has a regular, helical structure."
https://openalex.org/W1557041579,"Abstract The kinetics of the reactions of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate with the reactive β93 sulfhydryl groups of human adult hemoglobin and γ93 sulfhydryl groups of human fetal hemoglobin has been studied at pH 7.0. An increase in the rate of reaction with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate upon oxygenation was seen for fetal hemoglobin, as well as adult hemoglobin. While no change in the reactivity of the α104 sulfhydryl group of αsh chains was seen upon oxygenation, a change in reactivity of the β93 and β112 sulfhydryl groups of β chains and the γ93 sulfhydryl group of γsh chains was detected upon liganding. This change in reactivity with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, presumably reflecting a change in conformation of these isolated chains upon ligand binding, was in a direction opposite to that observed for the intact hemoglobins. These findings, along with the established fact that p-hydroxymercuribenzoate-modified β and γ chains have a much lower affinity for oxygen than native β and γ chains, are consistent with a linked functional relationship between the binding of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and the state of liganding in these isolated non-α subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1626596192,"Abstract An enzyme preparation from Cryptococcus laurentii catalyzes the transfer of glycosyl units from sugar nucleotides to exogenous acceptor resulting in the stepwise synthesis of a heteroglycan with the following structure: 2-O-α-d-mannosyl-6-O-α-d-mannosyl-3-O-α-d-mannosyl-(2-O-β-d-xylosyl-)-d-mannose. The same enzyme preparation transfers d-[14C]-mannosyl from GDP [14C]mannose to an endogenous glycoprotein acceptor. Analysis of the endogenous product after mild acid hydrolysis revealed the presence of Man-2-mannose, Man-3-mannose, and Man-6-mannose. The enzymes synthesizing the specific mannosyl linkages in the pentasaccharide have been shown to be distinct mannosyl-transferases (Schutzbach, J. S., and Ankel, H. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 2187–2194). The β-xylosyl linkage in the pentasaccharide is made by an enzyme that also transfers xylose from UDP-xylose to the same endogenous acceptor (Schutzbach, J. S., and Ankel, H. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6574–6580). Glycosyl transfer to exogenous and to endogenous acceptors appears to involve the same enzymes, suggesting that the pentasaccharide synthesized de novo is an integral part of the cell envelope glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1550205117,"Abstract The rate of enzyme phosphate turnover of rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase and the rate of glucose 1-phosphate turnover has been determined in a rapid mixing device both for the Mg2+ and the Zn2+-activated enzyme. In 1 µm glucose-1-P the turnover of enzyme phosphate of the Mg2+-activated enzyme was 5700 to 6700 min-1, while the rate of substrate phosphate turnover was 5900 min-1. The corresponding rates for the Zn2+-activated enzyme in 1 mm glucose-1-P were 20 to 30 min-1 and 10 min-1, respectively. Thus, in the presence of either metal, the enzyme phosphate was exchanged sufficiently rapidly to be a part of enzyme catalysis. Glucose 1,6-diphosphate did not alter the turnover rate of either the enzyme phosphate or the substrate phosphate for either of the two kinds of enzyme. This is in accord with the view that free glucose-1,6-P2 and dephosphoenzyme are not obligatory intermediates in the catalytic process."
https://openalex.org/W2002465441,"The budget picture for the NCI is presented for your information and evaluation-evaluation in the sense that I need and would appreciate your comments. A major issue of course is balance, in terms of clinic versus laboratory; short-term versus long-term; academic versus commercial; targeted versus nontargeted; grants versus contracts versus intramural; national versus international, and the like. It must be recognized that within a program of this emotion, visibility, and importance scientific findings and other considerations will dictate changes on at least a monthly basis. Things other than science contribute to this balance. On any given day we live within the impact of at least three budget years (what we received and did last year, what we will receive and do this year, and what this will allow us to receive and do next year). The federal budgetary process as well as the priority-setting processes of science are such that new directions cannot be taken as qulickly as woLld be optimal. Priorities muLst be set in cancer at least in their broad sense; for in addition to other areas of biomedical research, there are other compelling demands for the limited federal dollar. There will never be enouLgh resources to do all that can be done or needs to be done in cancer research. That probably is as it should be. In this regard it is heartening that operating funds for the institutes at NIH other than NCI will increase by $264 million in 1974. It is as true that information from research in other disciplines and categorical diseases will provide leads to cancer, as well as the reverse. And certainly, virtually no one wants to see resources for cancer increased at the expense of other important tasks and opportunities. This article is not an attempt to justify or to defend the spending plan of the National Cancer Program. It is to let youL know what's going on and to seek further advice on how to do it better. Articles on other aspects of the program will be published in journals including Science, Cancer Research, and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute."
