https://openalex.org/W1519102962,"Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase is a unique NO synthase isoform that is expressed constitutively by vascular endothelium both in vivo and in vitro and is believed essential to local vascular homeostasis. This calcium/calmodulin-dependent isoform is distinct from neuronal NO synthase. Genomic clones encoding the human endothelial NO synthase were isolated and the structural organization of the gene was determined. The gene contains 26 exons spanning approximately 21 kilobases of genomic DNA, encodes a messenger RNA of 4052 nucleotides, and is present as a single copy in the haploid human genome. Characterization of 5'-flanking genomic regions indicates that the endothelial NO synthase promoter is TATA-less and exhibits proximal promoter elements consistent with a constitutively expressed gene that is found in endothelial cells, namely Sp1 and GATA motifs. The 5'-flanking region contains putative AP-1, AP-2, NF-1, heavy metal, acute-phase response shear stress, and sterol-regulatory cis-elements. The human endothelial NO synthase gene was assigned to the 7q35-->7q36 region of chromosome 7 by Southern blot hybridization of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid lines and fluorescence in situ hybridization, whereas human neuronal NO synthase localized to the 12q24.2 region of chromosome 12."
https://openalex.org/W1996453015,"Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum are the major causes of human malaria, except in sub-Saharan Africa where people lack the Duffy blood group antigen, the erythrocyte receptor for P. vivax. Duffy negative human erythrocytes are resistant to invasion by P. vivax and the related monkey malaria, P. knowlesi. Several lines of evidence in the present study indicate that the Duffy blood group antigen is the erythrocyte receptor for the chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and melanoma growth stimulatory activity (MGSA). First, IL-8 binds minimally to Duffy negative erythrocytes. Second, a monoclonal antibody to the Duffy blood group antigen blocked binding of IL-8 and other chemokines to Duffy positive erythrocytes. Third, both MGSA and IL-8 blocked the binding of the parasite ligand and the invasion of human erythrocytes by P. knowlesi, suggesting the possibility of receptor blockade for anti-malarial therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1981023296,"The requirement of protein kinase C zeta (zeta PKC) for maturation of X. laevis oocytes in response to insulin, p21ras, and phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase C has recently been shown. Here we present experimental evidence demonstrating that activation of zeta PKC is not only necessary but also sufficient by itself to activate maturation in oocytes and to produce deregulation of growth control in mouse fibroblasts. Furthermore, by using a dominant kinase-defective mutant of zeta PKC, we confirm that this kinase is required for mitogenic activation in oocytes and fibroblasts. These results permit us to propose zeta PKC as a critical step downstream of p21ras in mitogenic signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W2079428986,"We have analyzed the variance associated with the decay of the non-NMDA receptor component of synaptic currents, recorded from mossy fiber-granule cell synapses in cerebellar slices, to obtain a conductance estimate for the synaptic channel. Current fluctuations arising from the random channel gating properties were separated from those arising from the fluctuations in the population of channels by subtracting the mean excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) waveform scaled to the EPSC peak amplitude. A weighted mean single-channel conductance of approximately 20 pS was determined from the relationship between the mean current and the variance around the mean during the decay of evoked and spontaneous synaptic currents. This result suggests that high conductance non-NMDA channels, such as the 10-30 pS glutamate receptor channel previously characterized in granule cells, carry the majority of the fast component of the EPSC at this synapse. In addition, our data are consistent with the activation of surprisingly few (approximately 10) non-NMDA channels by a single packet of transmitter."
https://openalex.org/W1594207045,"Members of the beta 1 integrin subfamily recognize multiple ligands such as fibronectin, laminin, and collagen and mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. beta 1 subunit may play a central role in regulating beta 1 integrin avidity. Here we have identified a small region of beta 1 subunit (residues 207-218) that is critical for the binding of both activating (8A2, A1A5, and TS2/16) and inhibiting (4B4, 4B5, 13, AIIB2, and P4C10) monoclonal antibodies against human beta 1 using interspecies chimeric beta 1 and site-directed mutagenesis. Chicken beta 1 that has human sequence within residues 207-218 (CH mutant) is recognized by all the human specific antibodies listed above. The region 207-218 is located between the two putative ligand binding sites (residues 120-182 and 220-231), and the amino acid sequence of the region involves a predicted bend structure. The other anti-beta 1 antibodies that do not affect cell attachment to ligands (K20, 102DF5, LM442, and LM534) recognized the carboxyl-terminal regions of extracellular domain of beta 1 (residues 426-587 for K20 and 588-708 for 102DF5, LM442, and LM534, respectively). Our data suggest a potential mechanism for the avidity regulation of beta 1 integrin through conformational changes of beta 1 subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1569792747,"We have investigated the mechanism of Ca2+ entry in fura-2-loaded human platelets using the inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, genistein, and methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate. Genistein (100 microM; 30 min) or methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate (1 microgram/ml; 30 min) reduced ADP-evoked protein-tyrosine phosphorylation at specific bands as assessed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with a specific antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Both compounds also reduced ADP-evoked [Ca2+]i rises in the presence, but not the absence, of external Ca2+, suggesting a relatively selective inhibition of Ca2+ entry over internal release. The inactive analogue of genistein, daidzein, was without effect on protein-tyrosine phosphorylation or ADP-evoked Ca2+ elevation in the presence or absence of external Ca2+. Methyl-2,5-dihydroxycinnamate (1 microgram/ml; 5 min) significantly reduced the Ca2+ influx evoked by depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores using the inhibitor of the endomembranous Ca(2+)-ATPase, thapsigargin. These results with tyrosine kinase inhibitors are unlikely to be the result of the inhibition of other protein kinases since kinases A, C, and G all inhibit agonist-evoked rises in [Ca2+]i in platelets. These data support a role for tyrosine kinases in the control of Ca2+ entry in human platelets."

https://openalex.org/W1519809500,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine whose many demonstrated actions include effects on cell growth and differentiation. TNF treatment of cells is known to lead to a rapid increase in serine/threonine phosphorylation of many cellular proteins, but the kinases responsible remain largely unidentified. We show that TNF treatment induces a rapid and transient increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity in the human diploid FS-4 cell line, for which TNF is known to be mitogenic. TNF-induced activation of MAPK was demonstrated by its enhanced ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein in vitro and by a characteristic shift in the electrophoretic mobility of MAPK proteins. MAPK activation was accompanied by a significant increase of MAPK phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which was demonstrated by 32P labeling of cells and isolation of the labeled proteins after immunoprecipitation with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, and by direct immunoblotting of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-fractionated unlabeled cell lysates with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. The pp42 and pp44 MAPK were the only proteins whose tyrosine phosphorylation was demonstrably increased in FS-4 cells after TNF treatment. MAPK activation is likely to represent an important component in the cascade of signals that link TNF receptors to various TNF-elicited cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W1543731498,"An antigen (Ag), as defined by reactivity with a monoclonal antibody (mAb 10G), was found on the cell wall surface and on the plasma membrane of Candida albicans yeast cells (Li, R. K., and Cutler, J. E. (1991) J. Gen. Microbiol. 137, 455-464). The 10G Ag from the cell surface location was solubilized by treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol and Zymolyase. Antigenic activity of the extract was lost following periodate oxidation, but was stable to proteolytic enzyme and heat treatments. Mannoproteins in the extract were fractionated by hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. A fraction containing the 10G Ag was degraded by mild acid hydrolysis and a tetrahexose eluted from a P-2 size exclusion column was found to be the epitope (10G epitope) part of the 10G Ag. By use of gas-liquid chromatography, mass spectroscopy, and H-1 proton NMR analysis, the 10G epitope was determined to be a linear beta-1,2-linked tetramannose. The 10G Ag, which was immunopurified from the Zymolyase extract, and the 10G epitope were involved in the attachment of C. albicans to mouse spleen marginal zone macrophages. Both the 10G Ag and the purified 10G epitope specifically inhibited C. albicans adherence in an ex vivo binding assay. Latex beads adsorbed with the 10G Ag or the 10G epitope adhered specifically to the splenic marginal zone macrophages. These data show that a beta-1,2-linked mannotetraose part of a C. albicans cell wall mannoprotein is an adhesin site that may play a role in pathogenesis of disseminated candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W1535574170,"Insulin inhibits the hepatic transcription of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1). In the present studies, human HEP G2 hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with human IGFBP-1 gene promoter constructs in order to identify cis elements and trans-acting factors that confer the insulin effect. Transfections of IGFBP-1 promoter deletion constructs localized an insulin responsive element (IRE) between approximately 140- and approximately 103-base pair (bp) 5' to the mRNA capsite. This region contains a 25-bp sequence which is 100% conserved in the rat IGFBP-1 promoter and which has two AT-rich, 8-bp elements exhibiting dyad symmetry. Site-directed mutagenesis of both elements in the same 1205-bp IGFBP-1 promoter construct abolished the inhibitory effect of insulin on promoter activity. Also, the native but not the mutant IGFBP-1 IRE conferred the inhibitory effect of insulin to the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. Gel mobility shift assays identified a DNA binding activity which specifically binds the native IGFBP-1 IRE and which is not altered by prior insulin treatment. The IGFBP-1 IRE sequence is similar to those of functionally mapped IREs from other gene promoters, suggesting that this common IRE and the protein(s) which it binds confer the insulin effect to a number of insulin-sensitive genes."
https://openalex.org/W1655421004,"Stimulation of activated T cells with interleukin-2 (IL-2) results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins. The present studies demonstrate that IL-2 stimulation induces phosphorylation of the src homology 2 domain-containing protein, p52shc, on both tyrosine and serine residues. The level of p52shc phosphorylation was maximal within 5 min after growth factor addition and declined gradually thereafter. In addition, anti-Shc immunoprecipitates from IL-2-stimulated T cells contained a co-precipitating protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity that phosphorylated p52shc on tyrosine residues in immune complex kinase assays. These results demonstrate that p52shc is an early substrate for IL-2 receptor-coupled PTK activity(s) and suggest that this protein may be involved in the transduction of PTK-dependent regulatory signals in IL-2-stimulated T cells."

https://openalex.org/W1542711462,"A novel human cDNA with a predicted protein homologous to the carboxyl end of lysyl oxidase, an extracellular enzyme involved in the maturation of collagen and elastin, has been isolated. The homology to lysyl oxidase begins exactly at the position of the exon 1/exon 2 boundary in the mouse gene (Contente, S., Csiszar, K., Kenyon, K., and Friedman, R. M. (1993) Genomics 16, 395-400). This lysyl oxidase-like gene, which appears to be no larger than 22.1 kilobases, codes for a single polyadenylated RNA species of 2.48 kilobases and has been mapped to chromosome 15q24-q25."
https://openalex.org/W1513791378,"Phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides bearing the 5'-alkylating moiety 4-(N-2-chloroethyl-N-methyl)aminobenzylamine specifically modify recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4) in solution. This reaction is saturable with respect to the alkylating oligonucleotide reagent. The existence of at least two binding sites, with different affinities, on the rsCD4 molecule, were demonstrated. The values of apparent Kd for the sites are approximately 0.1 and 1 microM. The existence of two sites was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of the modified protein, in which two distinct gel bands were seen. The modification is inhibited by excess non-alkylating oligonucleotide, as well as by phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. Quantitative estimates of the competition constants (Kc), for the binding of these competitors of the binding of the alkylating oligonucleotide reagent with rsCD4, have been made. By use of this method, several anionic dyes as well as potential anti-HIV therapeutic agents were also demonstrated to interact with rsCD4. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides also inhibit binding of rsCD4 with the monoclonal antibody L71.1.1 This monoclonal antibody recognizes the CDR3-like loop (D1 domain) of the rsCD4 molecule. Thus, oligonucleotide binding sites exist on two remote regions (i.e. both the CDR2- and CDR3-like loops) of the D1 domain of CD4."
https://openalex.org/W1495472560,"A current model for the regulation of the Src protein-tyrosine kinase proposes that the COOH-terminal phosphotyrosine, Tyr-527, binds to the Src homology 2 (SH2) region in an intramolecular interaction that represses the kinase domain. This model is consistent with the activation of Src by mutations in the SH2 domain or COOH terminus. Mutations in the SH3 domain also activate Src, although this region is not thought to bind phosphotyrosine. Seidel-Dugan et al. (Seidel-Dugan, C., Meyer, B. E., Thomas, S. M., and Brugge, J. S. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 1835-1845) have shown that Src mutants with deletions in the SH2 or SH3 domain transform chicken embryo fibroblasts and have increased kinase activity. These mutant proteins are underphosphorylated at Tyr-527, a change that could in itself activate the mutants. Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish whether the SH2 and SH3 domains are needed for phosphorylation of Tyr-527 or for Src to adopt or maintain the repressed state. We have artificially increased the level of Tyr-527 phosphorylation of SH2 and SH3 deletion mutants by coexpressing them with the Tyr-527 kinase, Csk, in yeast cells. We find that both the SH2 and SH3 domains are needed for inhibition of Src by Csk. The SH2 domain is needed for efficient phosphorylation by Csk, both in yeast cells and in vitro. The SH3 domain is needed for Src to be inhibited when Tyr-527 is phosphorylated by Csk. This suggests that the SH3 domain cooperates with the SH2 domain and phosphorylated Tyr-527 to inhibit the kinase domain. Dephosphorylation of SH3 domain mutants at Tyr-527 in fibroblasts could be a consequence of a failure of the proposed SH2/phosphotyrosine interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1544810387,"Integrins are cell surface heterodimers that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. We show that in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts the alpha v beta 3 integrin (vitronectin receptor) coprecipitates with a tyrosine-phosphorylated 190-kDa protein, as detected by antibodies to phosphotyrosine. Three different antibodies to the vitronectin receptor, all of which precipitate the alpha/beta complex, coprecipitated a 190-kDa protein. The three antibodies were raised against the purified placental vitronectin receptor, the platelet alpha IIb beta 3 integrin, and the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha v subunit. The association was specific for the vitronectin receptor, since an antibody to the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin (fibronectin receptor) did not coprecipitate any tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. The phosphorylation of the 190-kDa protein was observed only following cell activation by platelet-derived growth factor, which is known to stimulate tyrosine kinase activity and to modulate cell adhesion. Antibodies raised against the platelet-derived growth factor alpha and beta receptors (M(r) = 170,000 and 190,000, respectively) did not recognize the 190-kDa, integrin-associated phosphorylated protein. Occupancy of the vitronectin receptor by one of its ligands, vitronectin, resulted in an increased amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 190-kDa protein. Our data suggest that the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with integrins may play an important role in growth factor-mediated modulation of cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1560449048,"We recently reported the molecular cloning of HER4/p180erbB4, a new member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, as well as its activation by a partially purified ligand (Plowman, G. D., Culouscou, J.-M., Whitney, G. S., Green, J. M., Carlton, G. W., Foy, L., Neubauer, M. G., and Shoyab, M. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 1746-1750). In this report we describe the purification to homogeneity of a 45-kDa protein (p45) that induces the differentiation of MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells and stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of p180erbB4, the HER4-encoded protein. Hydrophobic interaction, ion-exchange, heparin, and size exclusion chromatographies were used to purify this p180erbB4 activator to homogeneity. N-terminal amino acid sequencing suggests that p45 is related to heregulin, a recently reported ligand for p185erbB2. Binding and cross-linking experiments demonstrated that p45 specifically binds to cells expressing recombinant p180erbB4 and not cells expressing recombinant p185erbB2."
https://openalex.org/W1589695823,"Senescent human diploid fibroblasts express several growth-regulated genes but fail to express others. In this paper we show, by a very sensitive technique (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), that senescent cells fail to express insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA, which is expressed in moderate amounts by young cells. Human fibroblasts immortalized by transfection with a temperature-sensitive SV40 T antigen gene regain the ability to express IGF-1 mRNA, but only at the permissive temperature of 34 degrees C. Under these conditions, the immortalized human fibroblasts grow even in 1% serum. At the restrictive temperature of 39 degrees C, the temperature-sensitive T antigen is nonfunctional, IGF-1 RNA is not detectable, and the cells fail to grow even in 10% serum. The failure to express IGF-1 mRNA in postsenescent cells can be ascribed, at least in part, to a transcriptional mechanism. Despite the correlation among immortalization by SV40 T antigen, expression of IGF-1, and growth, it seems unlikely that the failure to express IGF-1 is the sole cause of cellular senescence; other requirements must be postulated."
https://openalex.org/W1532443308,Synthetic antisense oligonucleotides have been used to inhibit specific protein synthesis in vivo. Antisense oligonucleotides directed to kinesin heavy chain were injected into the vitreous of anesthetized rabbits in order to assess the effects on transport in the retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve. The antisense oligonucleotide specifically inhibited retinal kinesin synthesis by 82 +/- 7% (n = 4). The rapid axonal transport of the membrane proteins into the optic nerve was concomitantly inhibited by 70 +/- 10% (n = 4). These results provide direct evidence for the specific role of kinesin in rapid anterograde transport in vivo and indicate the utility of antisense oligonucleotides to explore neuronal dynamics in a specific neuronal cell type in a living animal.
https://openalex.org/W1513238427,"The specific structural features of 24 N-acetylneuraminic acid derivatives required for the high affinity interaction of sialoglycoconjugates with the sialic acid-specific lectin from the slug Limax flavus were studied by hapten inhibition of precipitation. These results provide insight regarding the structure of the binding pocket for N-acetylneuraminic acid that exists in L. flavus agglutinin (LFA). The alpha-anomer of sialic acid is a very important factor in binding to the slug lectin. The carboxylic acid group makes only a moderate contribution to binding, since modifications of the carboxylic group decrease binding approximately 5-fold. Modification or removal of the hydroxyl group on carbon 4 does not affect binding. However, when the C4 epimer was tested, there was a dramatic decrease in binding, suggesting that whereas the equatorial hydroxyl at C4 does not contribute to binding, the introduction of an axial hydroxyl group at C4 sterically hinders the binding interaction. The substituent on the 5-amino group occupies an important role in binding of Neu5Ac to LFA as well. When the acetyl is modified by the addition of a hydroxyl group to yield the N-glycolyl derivative, we observed a 20-fold decrease, while the removal of the methyl to form the N-formyl derivative resulted in a 50-fold decrease. The 5-amino derivative was the poorest inhibitor of all compounds examined, indicating a critical role for the N-acetyl group in high affinity binding to LFA. The glyceryl tail also appears to be critical for binding inasmuch as acetylation of the C9 hydroxyl group or periodate cleavage of carbons 8 and 9 resulted in a 20- to 50-fold decrease in binding. The equilibrium constant (K(a)) for binding of Neu5Ac to LFA is 3.8 x 10(4) M-1, with a single binding site (n = 0.85) per monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1480264538,"Transcription elongation factor S-II mediates nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II (Reines, D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800). We have examined the mechanism of action of the Drosophila S-II analog, DmS-II, in a defined transcription system. Our results show that DmS-II is necessary and sufficient to activate nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II during transcription of a dC-tailed template. The pattern of transcripts resulting from prolonged action by DmS-II indicates that there are kinetic barriers to transcript shortening. During the cleavage reaction, the polymerase remains in register with the template strand and generates mainly nucleotide dimers. The ability of DmS-II to mediate transcript shortening resides in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. Our results support a model for pause suppression in which DmS-II binds to the paused polymerase, causes one cleavage event and is then released from the complex. Elongation by the polymerase then allows a second encounter with the pause site and a second chance of passing the site. Complete pause suppression may require multiple transcript shortening events for some polymerase molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1494104731,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces programmed growth arrest in human melanoma cells, A375-C6. IL-1 action in these cells is associated with induction of a cell type-specific immediate-early (IE) gene expression program characterized by strong, rapid, and sustained induction of gro-alpha and gro-beta, but transient induction of c-jun, IRG-9, and NAK-1, and lack of induction of c-myc. With the exception of gro-alpha and gro-beta, these IE genes are also associated with growth-stimulatory responses in the melanoma cells, suggesting that the gro-genes may play key roles in the growth arrest action of the cytokine. To elucidate the early intracellular signals associated with IL-1 action, we are studying the second messenger signals and transcription factors required for induction of gro-genes. Here, we present evidence that IL-1-inducible gro-gene expression is dependent on tyrosine kinase signaling. Using gel retardation and transient expression assays, we show that IL-1 causes protein tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activation of NF-kappa B enhancer binding protein, which then induces transcription of the gro-genes via an NF-kappa B site located 76 base pairs upstream from the cap site. IL-1-activated protein tyrosine phosphorylation is also required for gro-gene induction in human cervical carcinoma cells, HeLa; human fibroblast cells, WI-38; and mouse fibroblast cells, L929. Thus, in diverse cell types, IL-1 induces gro-genes via tyrosine kinase-dependent signals."
https://openalex.org/W1599098655,"Abstract Previous studies have shown that channel formation in the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli by colicin A and phage T5 leads to an efflux of cytoplasmic potassium and to a membrane depolarization. Here we show that upon opening of these channels, the intracellular ATP concentration is decreased to 10% of its original value in < 5 min. ATP is not found in the external medium, but is hydrolyzed in the cytoplasm into ADP and AMP. The rate of ATP hydrolysis depends on the number of channels and on their activity. ATP hydrolysis takes place if the F1F0-ATPase is absent or inhibited. Depolarization of the inner membrane is not the main cause of ATP hydrolysis. Opening of the phage and colicin channels also leads to an efflux of inorganic phosphate. Conditions that prevent the efflux of phosphate (i.e. depolarization of the cells and high external phosphate concentration) prevent ATP hydrolysis. We propose that ATP is hydrolyzed as a consequence of a shift in the ATP equilibrium due to the efflux of phosphate through the channels. The consequences for the cells of this ATP depletion are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1878693307,"Aerolysin is a channel-forming protein secreted as a protoxin by Aeromonas hydrophila. Analytical centrifugation measurements showed that proaerolysin is a dimer in solution, and this was confirmed by chemical cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate. Dissociation of proaerolysin with low concentrations of SDS resulted in the loss of tertiary structure, assessed by near ultraviolet circular dichroism. This was accompanied by an increase in the protein's ability to bind the hydrophobic dye 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate, as well as by increased sensitivity to proteolytic degradation. However, the monomer was not fully unfolded by the detergent, as the tryptophans remained in a hydrophobic environment, and the secondary structure measured by far ultraviolet circular dichroism did not seem to be affected. Aerolysin, the active form of the protein, was also shown to be a dimer, and its stability was found to be no different from the stability of the protoxin dimer. Substituting tryptophan 371 or tryptophan 373 with leucine greatly reduced the stability of dimeric proaerolysin. These substitutions are known to increase the protein's ability to oligomerize, supporting the conclusion that dimer dissociation is necessary for oligomerization to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1561543281,"L cells were enriched about 100-fold for catalase by the transcription of the transfected cDNA for human catalase. In spite of substantial enrichment for catalase, the transfected cells (LFN7C/B3) were not resistant to the cytotoxicity of a variety of agents which reduce dioxygen, including paraquat, menadione, adriamycin, phenazine methosulfate, and bleomycin. Instead, they were more sensitive to paraquat, bleomycin, and adriamycin than the untransfected cells from which they derived. Desferrioxamine afforded the cells enriched for catalase modest protection from the toxicities of bleomycin, paraquat, or adriamycin, suggesting that enrichment for iron as a consequence of the increased cellular content of catalase accounted for some of the increased sensitivities. The increased sensitivity of the LFN7C/B3 cells to bleomycin and paraquat was also attributed to the ability of catalase in cells to prevent the drug-induced consumption of O2; by capturing H2O2 before it can escape the cell and converting it to O2, catalase can maintain the concentration of O2 either for repeated rounds of chemical reduction or for direct interaction with the toxin. As predicted by this formulation, the toxicities of paraquat and of bleomycin were increased in an atmosphere of 40% dioxygen in comparison with an atmosphere of 20% dioxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1596092489,"The reaction of highly purified lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) with defined reconstituted discoidal apoA-I-containing lipoproteins (LpA-I) with 2, 3, or 4 apoA-I molecules/particle (Lp2, 3, or 4A-I) has been studied in the presence of a number of specific anti apoA-I antibodies. Among nine anti-apoA-I monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) reacting with epitopes distributed over 80% of the sequence, three significantly inhibit the LCAT reaction with all particles. The position of their epitopes located in the middle to COOH-terminal region between residues 96-121 (3G10), 135-148 (A03), and 149-186 (A44) is compatible with an inhibition by steric hindrance over a central domain. Antibody 4H1 binding to the NH2 terminus (residues 2-8) profoundly increases (5-fold) the LCAT reaction with Lp2A-I (7.8 nm), but not with other particles. Other mAbs, A11 and 5F6, binding to epitopes (residues 99-139 and 118-141) enhance LCAT reactivity with the small Lp2A-I (7.8 nm) and Lp3A-I (10.8 nm) but not with their larger counterparts. Most mAbs have similar effects on LCAT reaction with native high density lipoprotein3 as with LpA-I. The inhibitory or enhancing effects of these mAbs are also observed with Fab fragments and not related to their binding affinity for apoA-I containing reconstituted lipoprotein particles. The intercalation of epitopes for mAbs that inhibit or enhance LCAT reaction with small LpA-I is compatible not with steric hindrance but with conformational modifications of apoA-I and indirectly of the lipids in small particles. We propose that enhancing mAbs act by stabilization of an apoA-I conformation which is not favored in small LpA-I, i.e. by increasing binding of amphipathic helices to lipids or by interfering with the mobility of a hinged domain. The epitopes for the inhibitory mAbs can be shown to overlap on several LpA-I models, indicating that steric hindrance over a single site is a possible mechanism of inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1551935161,"Abstract The role that soluble binding proteins might play in regulating transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)-induced growth of smooth muscle cells (SMC) is unknown. alpha 2-Macroglobulin (alpha 2M) is the major plasma binding protein for TGF-beta. Reaction of alpha 2M with methylamine (alpha 2M-MA) forms activated alpha 2M which binds TGF-beta and specific cell surface receptors. The objectives of these studies were to determine whether native alpha 2M or alpha 2M-MA influences growth responses of cultured rat aortic SMC to TGF-beta 1. Results demonstrated that native alpha 2M was not mitogenic. Treatment with alpha 2M-MA or TGF-beta 1 stimulated a 3- or 3.5-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation, respectively. Cotreatment with TGF-beta 1 and alpha 2M-MA resulted in a 70-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. SMC bound alpha 2M-MA in a specific and saturable manner and expressed alpha 2M receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). A modified form of alpha 2M-MA (alpha 2M-MA-cis-dichlorodiammine platinum), which bound TGF-beta 1 but did not bind alpha 2M receptors, failed to enhance TGF-beta 1-induced growth. In summary, results demonstrated that alpha 2M-MA enhanced TGF-beta 1-induced growth responses and that this effect was dependent on alpha 2M-MA binding to alpha 2M receptor/LRP."
https://openalex.org/W1544206372,"Vaccinia DNA topoisomerase specifically binds and forms a covalent adduct at DNA sites containing a conserved sequence element 5'(C/T)CCTT decreases in the scissile strand. The molecular interactions that contribute to recognition of the CCCTT motif in a synthetic DNA substrate have been examined using modification interference, modification protection, and analog substitution techniques. We report that topoisomerase makes contact with guanine nucleotide bases of the pentamer motif complementary strand (3'GGGAA) within the major groove of the DNA helix and that alteration of the binding surface by chemical modification is deleterious to the interaction. Additional contacts are made with guanine residues located outside the pentamer element. The enzyme is unable to form a covalent adduct with synthetic RNA substrates. Analysis of the cleavage of DNA duplexes containing 2'OMe sugars suggests that the inability of the vaccinia topoisomerase to cleave either an RNA duplex or an RNA:DNA hybrid can be accounted for by the interfering effects of a 2' sugar substituent at two or more sites within the pentamer. Interaction with the sugar at the +2T nucleotide appears to be the most critical, as judged by the effects of single sugar substitutions."
https://openalex.org/W1560480335,"Abstract A putative mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has recently been identified, which potentially phosphorylates the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor at a physiological site (Thr-669) and is distinguished from other MAPKs/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) on the basis of chromatographic, immunological, and kinetic data. Here we report that this newly discovered MAPK is physically associated with the EGF receptor in A431 cells and with the related receptor/tyrosine kinase HER2 (encoded by c-neu) in enzyme preparations obtained from Wilm's tumors. This human EGF receptor-associated kinase is characterized as a 40-kDa Thr-669 kinase that exists in a high molecular mass complex with the respective growth factor receptor. EGF treatment of A431 cells stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of p40 and increases Thr-669 kinase activity in p40-containing fractions. The 40-kDa kinase is recognized by affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against the sea star p44mpk and a Pan-ERK antibody directed against the conserved subdomain VIII of MAPKs/ERKs, but is not recognized by antibodies selective for the rat p44erk1 and/or the p42mapk/erk2 isoforms, thus identifying the EGF receptor-associated kinase as a novel MAPK that may regulate receptor function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1573155090,"Pig liver GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase was purified 5,000-fold to apparent homogeneity using standard techniques. The native enzyme showed a single band on gels of about 450 kDa and two subunits of 43 and 37 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 37-kDa (beta-) subunit had only methionine at its amino terminus and a surprisingly hydrophobic sequence: Met-Lys-Ala-Leu-Ile-Leu-Val-Gly-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Thr-Arg-Leu- Arg-Pro-Leu-Thr-Leu-Ser-Ile-Pro-Lys. The 43-kDa (alpha-) subunit was blocked at the amino terminus, but a 29-kDa CNBr fragment had the following sequence: Leu-Asp-Ala-His-Arg-His-Arg-Pro-His-Pro- Phe-Leu-Leu-. Substrate specificity studies done in the direction of formation of nucleoside triphosphate and sugar-1-P indicated that the enzyme was most effective with GDP-glucose as substrate (100%) followed by IDP-mannose (72%) and then GDP-mannose (61%). That GDP-mannose and GDP-glucose activities were indeed catalyzed by the same enzyme was indicated by the following. (i) Various studies indicated that the enzyme was homogeneous. (ii) A staining procedure for production of GTP stained the same single band on native gels when either GDP-mannose or GDP-glucose was the substrate. (iii). GDP-mannose inhibited the utilization of GDP-glucose by the enzyme, and vice versa. When 8-azido-[32P]GTP was incubated with native enzyme and exposed to UV light, both the 43-kDa and the 37-kDa subunits became labeled, although the 37-kDa subunit reacted more strongly. On the other hand, 8-azido-GDP-[32P]mannose only photolabeled the 43-kDa band. Most importantly, the purified enzyme can be utilized to produce 8-azido-[32P]GDP mannose or 8-azido-[32P]GDP glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1547036795,"The receptor for the growth and motility factor, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by the MET oncogene. Previous work has shown that receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine is critical for both kinase activation and association with intracellular signal transducers. In this paper, we report that a protein tyrosine phosphatase activity (PTP) coprecipitates with the HGF/SF receptor. The associated PTP activity correlates with the kinase activation of the receptor, increasing up to 5-fold over the basal level after HGF/SF stimulation. The increase is reversible and time- and dose-dependent. A comparable level of activity is associated with constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors immunoprecipitated from cells where the MET oncogene is amplified and overexpressed. In these cells, a parallel decrease in PTP activity is observed after inhibition of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation following protein kinase C activation. The associated PTP activity is effective in dephosphorylating the HGF/SF receptor. These data show that a protein tyrosine phosphatase is functionally coupled to the HGF/SF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1507405252,"Bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase), a homolog of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A), is isolated as a dimer in which the subunits are cross-linked by two disulfide bonds. In addition to this anomalous quaternary structure, the enzyme has extraordinary biological properties, such as antispermatogenic, antitumor, and immunosuppressive activities. The molecular bases for these properties are well-suited for exploration with the techniques of recombinant DNA. Accordingly, a gene encoding BS-RNase was designed based on criteria expected to maximize the translational efficiency of its mRNA in Escherichia coli. This gene was constructed from 12 synthetic oligonucleotides and expressed with the phage T7 system. The protein thus produced was insoluble and accumulated under optimal conditions to 15% of total cellular protein or 200 mg/liter of culture. Ribonuclease activity was generated by air oxidation of the reduced and denatured protein. Three forms of active BS-RNase were isolated by gel filtration chromatography: the well-characterized dimer and monomer and a previously uncharacterized form that migrated as a trimer. The ribonuclease activities of all three forms were equivalent to or higher than that of dimeric BS-RNase isolated from bull seminal plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1518788594,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor IIIC/tau is a multisubunit DNA-binding protein that plays key roles in tRNA and 5 S rRNA gene activation. Subunit composition, stoichiometry, and in vivo phosphorylation of TFIIIC/tau factor were investigated using factor prepared from strains carrying modified forms of TFC1, the gene encoding the 95-kDa TFIIIC/tau subunit (tau 95). Using an epitope-tagged TFC1 as well as a TFC1-lacZ fusion, TFIIIC was shown to contain a single 95-kDa subunit, which was localized by electron microscopy into tau A, the A block-binding domain of TFIIIC/tau. Three 35S-labeled polypeptides (at 138, 131, and 91 kDa) coimmunoprecipitated with a tau 95-beta-galactosidase fusion protein. The coprecipitation of the 91-kDa polypeptide makes it a likely subunit of the factor. Immunoprecipitation from 32P-labeled extracts revealed that three of the subunits (138, 131, and 95 kDa), but not the 91-kDa component, are phosphorylated in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1567198911,"Abstract In T84 cells, we investigated how stimulation of protein kinase C leads to an inhibition of cAMP-dependent chloride secretion. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the inhibition was caused by loss of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), an apical membrane chloride channel. As described by others (Trapnell, B. C., Zeitlin, P. L., Chu, C.-S., Yoshimura, K., Nakamura, H., Guggino, W. B., Bargon, J., Banks, T. C., Dalemans, W., Pavirani, A., Lecocq, J.-P., and Crystal, R. G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10319-10323), we found that treatment with the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), reduced CFTR mRNA levels by approximately 80% with a t 1/2 of approximately 2 h. Chloride secretion, measured as forskolin-induced short circuit current, was also abolished by PMA with a t 1/2 of approximately 2 h. Levels of mature glycosylated CFTR measured by Western blotting also declined to 50 +/- 8% (n = 7) of control after a 12-h PMA treatment. However, a 12-h exposure to PMA did not affect the forskolin-stimulated efflux of 125I into high potassium medium, a measure of apical membrane CFTR activity. We conclude that increased turnover of apical membrane CFTR in PMA-treated cells compensates for the decline in anion channel numbers. By contrast to its lack of effect on 125I effluxes, PMA reduced the cAMP-induced increase in 86Rb efflux, suggesting that it inhibits chloride secretion mainly by an action on basolateral potassium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1502539056,"The rrn promoter regions of Escherichia coli contain a stretch of DNA, rich in An and Tn homopolymer sequences, which is located upstream of the tandem promoters P1 and P2. We have studied the effects of the upstream sequence of the rrnD operon on promoter function, using deletion variants for in vitro transcription. The presence of the upstream activating sequence (UAS) was found to increase P1 promoter strength without influencing P2. Two modes of P1 activation could be distinguished: a stimulation of P1 depending on the interaction of the factor of inversion stimulation (FIS) with the UAS (within the deletion boundaries of -50 and -112) and second, a factor-independent activation requiring the proximal part of the UAS (within the boundaries of -50 and -89). Both modes of activation were previously observed in the case of the rrnB operon and were ascribed to increased constants of RNA polymerase binding to P1 (Leirmo, S., and Gourse, R. L. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 220, 555-568; Zacharias, M., Theissen, G., Bradaczek, C., and Wagner, R. (1991) Biochimie 73, 699-712). Our results show, however, that the mechanisms of upstream activation may vary with the reaction conditions. In a complex transcription system, originally designed for the use of cell extracts, FIS enhances first-order reactions that convert binary (open) complexes to transcribing complexes. Initiated complexes are stabilized by FIS. The factor-independent mode of P1 activation involves influences of the UAS on complex isomerizations as well as on binary complex formation. The results show that low molecular weight components of the complex transcription system change the function of the RNA polymerase at the rrn promoters (not at the reference promoter Ptac), so that the conversion of open to transcribing P1-complexes becomes dependent on the UAS and FIS."
https://openalex.org/W1484114705,"We have analyzed with deletion mutations the Escherichia coli rho-dependent transcription terminator trp t'. This site, 211 nucleotides in length, contains multiple sequence elements that are recognized by rho. Among these multiple elements are two that together appear to be important for full transcription termination efficiency in vitro and are similar to the rutA and rutB sequence elements in the lambda tR1 rho-dependent terminator previously described by Chen and Richardson (1987). The results suggest for the first time that common functionally important elements are shared among rho-dependent terminators. Other regions of trp t' also appear to contribute to its functional efficiency, consistent with the idea that rho-dependent terminators contain dispersed and redundant recognition segments."
https://openalex.org/W1532452756,"Abstract The Mauriceville mitochondrial plasmid of Neurospora encodes a reverse transcriptase that synthesizes a full-length cDNA copy of the major plasmid transcript beginning directly opposite the 3' end of the template RNA (Kuiper, M. T. R., and Lambowitz, A. M. (1988) Cell 55, 693-704). Here, we show that the Mauriceville plasmid reverse transcriptase has no detectable RNase H activity and that cDNAs synthesized either by the column-purified reverse transcriptase or by the endogenous reverse transcriptase in purified ribonucleoprotein particles remain in a full-length duplex with the template RNA. The column-purified Mauriceville plasmid reverse transcriptase initiates cDNA synthesis by using short DNA primers, which remain attached to the 5' end of the (-) strand DNA (Wang, H., Kennell, J. C., Kuiper, M. T. R., Sabourin, J. R., Saldanha, R., and Lambowitz, A. M. (1992) Mol. Cell. Biol. 12, 5131-5144). We find that these primer DNAs can be precisely removed by S1 nuclease digestion of the initial cDNA.RNA duplex, suggesting a mechanism whereby this structure may contribute to primer removal in vivo. Finally, we show that Neurospora mitochondria contain an endogenous RNase H activity, which is present in mitochondrial ribonucleoprotein particle preparations prior to their purification. This mitochondrial RNase H can degrade the endogenous plasmid transcript in ribonucleoprotein particles in vitro and could play a similar role in vivo. The finding that the Mauriceville plasmid reverse transcriptase, which is believed to be a primitive enzyme, has no detectable RNase H activity is consistent with the hypothesis that retroviral reverse transcriptases acquired their RNase H domains from a gene encoding a cellular RNase H."
https://openalex.org/W1548637544,"The insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR) (1271 amino acids) is expected to have unique functions as a novel member of the insulin receptor family. In this paper, we report two alternatively spliced variants of rat IRR mRNA, which are predicted to encode two truncated forms of IRR, sIRR-1 (410 amino acids) and sIRR-2 (469 amino acids). The amino acid sequence of sIRR-1 is identical to the N-terminal 410-amino acid sequence of IRR. sIRR-2 has an additional 59-amino acid insertion in the C-terminal region. Both truncated forms retain the N-terminal and cysteine-rich domains but lack the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domains, indicating that the truncated forms are the secreted forms. The translation products of the truncated form mRNAs were detected in the stomach and kidney by Western analysis. However, the physiological significance of the secreted forms remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1561768652,"An enzyme specific for oligosaccharides with type 1 chain was purified 7,000-fold from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. 142. The enzyme, lacto-N-biosidase, was induced and secreted into culture medium when the strain was cultured in the presence of porcine stomach mucin. The enzyme was purified by anion-exchange chromatography on Q Sepharose, cation-exchange chromatography on S Sepharose, fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono S column, and gel filtration chromatography on TSK gel HW55S. To remove contaminating alpha-1,3/4-fucosidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, final purification was done by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono S column and affinity chromatography on N-acetylglucosamine agarose. The purified enzyme gave only one major protein band with an apparent M(r) of 60,000 on sodium dodesyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme had maximum activity at pH 5.5 and was stable at the pH range of 4.0-10.0. Substrate specificity studies with oligosaccharides labeled with 2-aminopyridine showed that the enzyme specifically hydrolyzed lacto-N-tetraose and the N-acetyllactosamine type of triantennary sugar chain with the type 1 chain, but did not hydrolyze type 2 chain oligosaccharides or the type 1 chain oligosaccharides with fucose or sialic acid including lacto-N-fucopentaose I and II and alpha-2,3-sialyl lacto-N-tetraose. The enzyme released lacto-N-biose from asialofetuin, and almost all oligosaccharides in asialofetuin were found to have only type 2 chains. Sequential digestion of extended type 1 chain oligosaccharides with alpha-1,3/4-fucosidase and lacto-N-biosidase was possible."

https://openalex.org/W1517153181,"The retroviral nucleocapsid protein (NC) associates, histone-like, with genomic RNA within the viral capsid. NC, an essential component of replication competent retroviruses, is also associated with events leading both to virus assembly and to reverse transcription. The nucleic acid binding properties of NC are key to understanding these properties, yet only a minimal biochemical description of NC-nucleic acid interactions is available. We have used the anisotropy of the intrinsic fluorescence of NC from avian myeloblastosis virus to quantify its binding to a variety of nucleic acids. Using salt back-titrations, the intrinsic equilibrium association constant per nucleic acid site, K(obs), was determined for NC binding to single- and double-stranded RNAs and DNAs. In 0.125 M NaCl, 40 mM HEPES at pH 7.0 and 27 degrees C, the log K(obs) ranged from 3.3 to 4.0 (average 3.7) for these nucleic acids. From the salt dependence of K(obs), it was estimated that, on balance, 1 ion was displaced upon formation of each complex; it is likely that cation displacement from nucleic acid is offset by anion binding by protein during complex formation. The logarithm of the mean intrinsic affinity in the absence of polyelectrolyte effects, log KT, was 3.1, corresponding to a delta G of -4.2 kcal/mol. K(obs), KT, and the number of displaced ions were independent of pH between pH 5.6 and 8.9, indicating that NC residues that titrate in this pH range are not contributing to binding. K(obs) and KT increase with temperature, in the range 15 to 47 degrees C. From van't Hoff analysis, entropy was found to be the driving force for formation of the NC-poly(rA) complex, even in the absence of the polyelectrolyte effect. The general nature of NC interactions with nucleic acids is shown by the similarity of the K(obs) values for RNAs and DNAs in both single-stranded and double-stranded structures. This ability of NC to interact with all types of nucleic acids may provide it with the necessary versatility to function like a histone in facilitating the packaging of viral RNA and yet function early in infection, where it has been ascribed a role in facilitating reverse transcription."

https://openalex.org/W1541035415,"The neu gene encodes the transmembrane tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor, p185. To study neu-induced cellular transformation, we developed revertant cells from the neu-transformed NIH 3T3 cell line, B104-1-1, by treating the cells with the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate. The morphologically normal revertant cells were first selected by their ability either to attach to culture plates or to survive in the presence of the cytotoxic reagents colchicine or 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine. Two of the 21 candidate revertant cell lines isolated were further characterized and were found to lose their anchorage independence and ability to grow in 1% calf serum, indicating that they were nontransformed even though they still expressed p185 oncoprotein. The tyrosine residues of p185 in these two revertants were underphosphorylated, which may have contributed to their nontransformed status. In addition, these revertants also resisted transformation by neu and several additional oncogenes (H-ras, N-ras, v-mos, v-abl, and v-fos) as determined by focus forming assays. These results indicated that we had successfully developed, from neu-transformed cells, revertants exhibiting defective tyrosine phosphorylation of the neu oncoprotein. The results also suggested that neu and several other oncogenes may share common elements in their pathways for the induction of cellular transformation."

In it we describe the derivatization of proteins S6, S13, S16, and S18 with [3H]2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, identify the nature of the derivatized amino acids within each protein, and demonstrate that each DNP protein, denoted DNP-Sx, can be taken up into a reconstituted 30 S subunit when added to a reconstitution mixture containing 16 S rRNA and total 30 S protein depleted in Sx. We further demonstrate that each DNP-Sx binds within the 30 S subunit in a position identical or similar to that of the unmodified Sx protein, as judged by its meeting one or more of the following three criteria: (i) unmodified Sx competes with the uptake of DNP-Sx into 30 S subunits; (ii) DNP-Sx restores functional activity to those single protein omission reconstitution particles lacking full activity; (iii) DNP-Sx induces the uptake of proteins into 30 S subunits that depend on the presence of Sx.
