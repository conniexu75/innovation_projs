https://openalex.org/W2026395206,"A representative set of high resolution x-ray crystal structures of nonhomologous proteins have been examined to determine the preferred positions and orientations of noncovalent interactions between the aromatic side chains of the amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, and tryptophan. To study the primary interactions between aromatic amino acids, care has been taken to examine only isolated pairs (dimers) of amino acids because trimers and higher order clusters of aromatic amino acids behave differently than their dimer counterparts. We find that pairs (dimers) of aromatic side chain amino acids preferentially align their respective aromatic rings in an off-centered parallel orientation. Further, we find that this parallel-displaced structure is 0.5–0.75 kcal/mol more stable than a T-shaped structure for phenylalanine interactions and 1 kcal/mol more stable than a T-shaped structure for the full set of aromatic side chain amino acids. This experimentally determined structure and energy difference is consistent with ab initio and molecular mechanics calculations of benzene dimer, however, the results are not in agreement with previously published analyses of aromatic amino acids in proteins. The preferred orientation is referred to as parallel displaced π-stacking.

Attractive nonbonded interactions between aromatic rings are seen in many areas of chemistry, and hence are of interest to all realms of chemistry. Porphyrin aggregation (1Abraham R.J. Eivazi F.

Technol. 1989; 5: 229-251Google Scholar) can be attributed, at least in part, to aromatic-aromatic interactions. Aromatic-aromatic interactions have been implicated in catalytic hydroformylation (5Castonguay L.A. Rappé A.K. Casewit C.J. J. Am. Chem.

The vast majority of medicinal agents contain aromatic substituents and their differential recognition by proteins is likely dominated by aromatic-aromatic interactions (8Gilman A.G. Rall T.W. Mies A.S. Taylor P. The Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics. 8th Ed. McGraw Hill, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). In biologically related areas of chemistry, aromatic-aromatic interactions are crucially involved in protein-deoxynucleic acid complexes where interactions between aromatic residues and base pairs are seen in x-ray crystal structures (9Ishida T. Doi M. Ueda H. Inoue M. Scheldrick B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 2286-2294Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar,10Kamiichi K. Danshita M. Minamino N. Doi M. Ishidia T. Inoue M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because aromatic-aromatic interactions are so prevalent across chemistry, a large body of experimental and theoretical work has focused on determining the gas phase structure of the prototype, benzene dimer (11Hobza P. Selzle H.L. Schlag E.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 3500-3506Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 12Tsuzuki S. Uchimaru T. Mikami M. Tanabe K. Chem. Phys.

Chem. 1996; 100: 13348-13366Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the experimentally observed structure depends heavily upon the observation technique. Off-centered parallel displaced,1p, and T-shaped, 1t, structures are the most commonly cited orientations (StructureFU1). Large scale ab initio electronic structure theory suggests that the off-centered parallel displaced and T-shaped structures are nearly isoenergetic (11Hobza P. Selzle H.L. Schlag E.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 3500-3506Crossref Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 12Tsuzuki S. Uchimaru T. Mikami M. Tanabe K. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1996; 252: 206-210Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Jaffe R.L.

As reported by Sun and Bernstein (15Bernstein E.R. Sun S. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 13348-13366Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), empirical force field studies favor either off-centered parallel displaced or T-shaped structures depending upon the magnitude of the partial charges (qH = −qC) used in the electrostatic model. Small charges (<0.153) favor parallel displaced geometries; large partial charges (>0.3) favor T-shaped structures. Sun and Bernstein (15Bernstein E.R. Sun S. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 13348-13366Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggest further that the intermolecular potential surface is quite soft and that “one must view the dimer as a dynamic system rather than one with a well defined structure.” It is our thesis that in the hydrophobic core of a protein, in the solid state, the dynamical properties of benzene-benzene are quenched and a preferred structure does prevail, albeit the preferred structure of benzene dimer in a hydrophobic environment. The methodologies used are summarized under “Materials and Methods.” Results and discussion are provided under “Results,” and conclusions are drawn under “Discussion.” To determine the nature of aromatic-aromatic interactions in the hydrophobic cores of proteins the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank has been analyzed. A previously defined (16Abola E.E. Bernstein F.C. Bryant S.H. Koetzle T.F. Weng J. Allen F.H. Bergerhoff G. Sievers R. Protein Data Bank.

Scharf M. Schneider R. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 19Hobohm U. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) was used. The subset contained 505 proteins. Noncovalent interactions between the side chains of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), histidine (His), and tryptophan (Trp) amino acids were examined. To distinguish between configurations 1p and 1tthe relative orientations of the aromatic side chains need to be cataloged. The shape of axially symmetric aromatic rings can most naturally be represented in terms of the center of mass of the ring, the ring centroid, and the unique axis perpendicular to the ring plane, the surface normal vector (see Fig. 1 a). The intermolecular orientational information of one aromatic ring with respect to another, the pair orientation, is described by the centroid-centroid separation,R cen, a center-normal angle, θ, and a normal-normal angle, γ (see Fig. 1 b). The angles, θ and γ, correspond to solid body azimuthal angle rotation and Euler angle yaw, respectively (21Fan C.F. Olafson B.D. Blanco M. Hsu S.L. Macromolecules. 1992; 25: 3667-3676Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Pairs of aromatic residues were identified based onR cen < 12.0 Å. For both Phe and Tyr, the six carbons constituting the phenyl ring were used to determine the centroid; in Trp, only the five atoms in the five-membered portion of the indole ring were used, and the five atoms in the imidazole ring of His were used. A total of 30,444 centroid matches were found for all possible combinations of Phe, Tyr, Trp, and His (e.g.Phe-Phe, Phe-Tyr, Phe-Trp, Phe-His, etc.). The number distribution ofR cen values, shown in Fig. 2, was found to be bimodal with a minimum at ∼7.5 Å. In addition, for each pair of aromatic residues (R cen < 12.0 Å), closest contact distances (R clo) between the respective carbon and nitrogen atoms were calculated. The number distribution ofR clo values was found to also be bimodal with a prominent minimum between 4.5–5 Å (see Fig. 3). We interpret the minima inR cen and R clodistributions as representing the distance at which the interaction between the aromatic rings drops below the Boltzman temperature factor (∼0.6 kcal/mol at 300 K). Inside the minimum in the distribution there is a binding interaction between the rings; outside the minimum any direct ring-ring interaction is lost because of random thermal motion. Thus, residue pairs with R clo < 4.5 Å and/or R cen < 7.5Å contain information about the pair orientation preferences of aromatic side chains. A total of 1,682 aromatic-aromatic amino acid dimer pairs withR clo values less than 4.5 Å were found with 13% below 3.4 Å, the minimum value of the interatomic distance between two aromatic rings (20Hunter C.A. Singh J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). R cen, θ, and γ were determined for these pairs. As is true for any axially symmetric system, the probability distribution of solid angle space is asymmetric in both θ and γ. The source of this asymmetry is shown in Fig. 1 c for the spherical polar angle θ. θ is naturally peaked around 90° because of an increase in meridianal angle φ space as θ progesses from 0° to 90°. This leads to an increase in surface area and thus an increase in probability of occurrence. To properly identify the intrinsic energetic preferences of aromatic-aromatic interactions the angle probability distributions discussed below have been normalized so that a distribution without an angular energetic preference would appear flat. Another complicating factor in the analysis of the structural preferences of aromatic side chains is that aromatic molecules tend to form higher order clusters. In these clusters intra-cluster orientation is dictated by the cluster rather than discrete pairwise interactions. For example, three spheres can pack with the pair distances retained but three disks will adopt a pinwheel arrangement to maximize the individual interactions. This pinwheel arrangement was confirmed for benzene trimer by molecular mechanics (RFF1) (see Fig. 4). To ascertain the importance of higher order clustering effects, isolated dimers and isolated trimers need to be and have been analyzed separately in the present study. Further, because the vast majority of aromatic side chain residues are in the hydrophobic interior of proteins, the isolated dimers are present in a hydrophobic sea. The structural impact of this hydrophobic sea was investigated by placing a parallel-displaced dimer in a droplet of methane. The RFF1 isolated dimer and methane droplet structures were virtually identical. For reference, the RFF1 parallel-displaced and T-shaped binding energies of 2.75 and 1.95 kcal/mol are in reasonable accord with the MM3(95) 1The program MM3(94) is available from the Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange, Dept. of Chemistry, University of Indiana, Bloomington, IN 47401 and from Tripos Associates, Inc., 1699 South Hanley Rd., Suite 303, St. Louis, MO 63144. values of 2.57 and 1.88 kcal/mol, respectively. To further characterize the nature of the nonbonded interaction between benzene rings and to find out when the “bond” between them drops below the Boltzman temperature factor, parallel-stacked and T-shaped potential energy surfaces were constructed by incrementally increasing the centroid distance by 0.5 Å starting at aR cen of 3.5 Å and stopping at aR cen of 10.0 Å. The binding energies were determined at each centroid distance and the van der Waals and electrostatics contributions to the binding energy are plotted in Fig. 5. In the parallel-stacked case, the van der Waals contribution is the dominating effect and the electrostatics contribution is actually repulsive, although small (<1 kcal/mol). On the other hand, the van der Waals contribution in the T-shaped case is not overwhelming, and it is the attractive electrostatics contribution that results in the overall binding of ∼2.0 kcal/mol. Significantly, for both parallel-stacked and T-shaped structures the binding energy drops below the Boltzman temperature factor (0.592 kcal/mol at 300 K) at roughly 7.5Å. Population distributions for the inter-ring orientational angles θ and γ shown in Figs.Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8were generated considering only dimers of aromatic side chains and correcting for spherical polar and Euler angle probability bias. If there was no intrinsic angular energetic preference, the profiles in Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 would appear flat; instead the θ distribution (Fig. 6 b) has a peak near 30° and the γ distributions (Figs. 6 a and 7) have peaks around 0°. This combination of θ and γ, determined from experimental data, corresponds to an off-centered parallel configuration, in accord with most ab initio and empirical force-field structural estimates of gas phase benzene dimer. To directly compare the preferred conformation of aromatic amino acids in the Protein Data Bank with the ab initio and molecular mechanics results of benzene dimer, we focus on the γ distribution for Phe-Phe interactions. The distribution for Phe-Phe interactions (Fig. 7 b) is less peaked than the distribution for all aromatic side chains (Figs. 6 a and7 a). Further, because there is six times less Phe-Phe data there is more scatter in the plot. For both Phe-Phe interactions and the full dataset the shape of the γ distribution can be fit to a Boltzmann distribution assuming 1) the parallel-displaced structure is more stable that the T-shaped structure, 2) that the energy difference has a sin γ dependence, and 3) that the temperature is 300 K. For the full dataset the parallel-displaced structure is found to be more stable by 1.0 kcal/mol, as indicated by the solid line in Fig. 7 a. For the Phe-Phe pairs the parallel-displaced structure is found to be more stable by 0.5–0.75 kcal/mol. The 0.5–0.75 kcal/mol distributions are shown as dashed andsolid lines, respectively, in Fig. 7 b. The Phe-Phe energy difference is consistent with ab initioelectronic structure as well as molecular mechanics estimates of the energy difference.Figure 7a, γ angle distribution of all dimer cluster pairs; a Boltzmann distribution with an energy factor of 1 kcal/mol is superimposed over the experimental data. b, γ angle distribution of dimer clusters of Phe-Phe pairs; Boltzmann distributions with energy factors of 0.5 kcal/mol (dashed line) and 0.75 kcal/mol (solid line) are superimposed over the experimental data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8a, γ angle distribution of trimer clusters of 1,144 aromatic-aromatic amino acid side chains.b, θ angle distribution of 1,144 trimer clusters of aromatic-aromatic amino acid side chains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In Fig. 8 we show that the orientational effects of π-stacking are less apparent in the probability distribution of trimers. Normalized θ and γ distributions for aromatic side chain amino acid pairs withR clo < 7.5 Å do not show as pronounced peaks for trimers as for dimers. The peak in θ of ∼25°, which was seen in the dimers, does not manifest itself as clearly in the trimer clusters. Rather, there appears to be two peaks between a θ value of 10° and 30° as opposed to one distinct value of 20° seen in the dimer cluster. Normalized θ and γ distributions from the full set of data for aromatic-aromatic amino acid pairs with R clo > 7.5 Å do not show any pronounced peaks. As discussed above, this is presumably because of the absence of thermally significant binding at this large distance. When homopairs of side chains where examined, 4,716 matches were found for Phe-Phe, 3,050 for Tyr-Tyr, 1,124 for His-His, and 688 for Trp-Trp. The only structural difference between Phe and Tyr is the presence of the para-OH on Tyr. A plot of the centroid distanceversus the closest contact distance represents this finding (Fig. 9). Because Phe lacks thepara-OH, there are a greater number of centroid contacts found that are less than 6.5 Å the minimum in the Phe-Phe plot; 4,716 Phe-Phe interactions less than 12.0 Å were tabulated, and 1,226 or 26% pair orientations were found less than 6.5 Å. In contrast, only 3,050 Tyr-Tyr interactions less than 12.0 Å were found and 556 or 18% pair orientations existed less than 6.5 Å. This difference can be seen by comparing Fig. 9 a with 9c and Fig. 9 b with 9d. Even though in the parallel shaped Tyr dimer there are no steric interactions inhibiting aR clo between the two amino acids, in other orientations (such as the T-shaped), the para-OH does reduce the number of R clo. Additional information is found in plots of intermolecular distances (R cen, R clo)versus the interplanar angle, γ. IfR clo is plotted versus the interplanar angle, γ, a near constancy in R clois found (see Fig. 10). Regardless of angle, the aromatic side chains orient in a fashion to minimizeR clo between the two rings and thus maximize the van der Waals attraction. Further, as also shown in Fig. 2, the number density drops off at a R clo of ∼4.5Å. WhenR cen is plotted versus the interplanar angle, γ, the bottom of the distribution is linearly dependent upon angle (Fig. 11). This is because of parallel orientations (small γ) having shorterR cen than T-shaped orientations.Figure 11Plot of intermolecular distance,R clo, versusinterplanar angle, γ-.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) By using a nonhomologous set of proteins, correcting for probability distribution bias, and including only isolated dimer pairs we find aromatic side chain amino acids do have a preferred intermolecular structure. The preferred parallel-displaced orientation is found to be more stable than a T-shaped structure by 0.5–0.75 kcal/mol for Phe-Phe dimers and by 1.0 kcal/mol for the full set of dimers.

They suggest that the majority of aromatic-aromatic interactions can be attributed to T-shaped configurations and that parallel displaced orientations are not generally found in proteins, in contrast to the present study. As has been pointed out by Thornton et al. (27Thornton J.M. Singh J. Campbell S. Blundell T.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) this may largely be a result of neglecting the inherent bias in the probability distribution of angles. The present study uses a more extensive, more representative sample of nonhomologous proteins than previous investigations. Moreover, clustering appears to dilute the effect of π-stacking. Future studies will focus on the role of π-stacking in determining tertiary structure and its possible impact on structure-based drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2136573391,"Stimulation of various cells with growth factors results in a transient increase in the intracellular concentration of H2O2 that is required for growth factor-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The effect of H2O2 produced in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was investigated in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. H2O2 inactivated recombinant PTP1B in vitro by oxidizing its catalytic site cysteine, most likely to sulfenic acid. The oxidized enzyme was reactivated more effectively by thioredoxin than by glutaredoxin or glutathione at their physiological concentrations. Oxidation by H2O2 prevented modification of the catalytic cysteine of PTP1B by iodoacetic acid, suggesting that it should be possible to monitor the oxidation state of PTP1B in cells by measuring the incorporation of radioactivity into the enzyme after lysis of the cells in the presence of radiolabeled iodoacetic acid. The amount of such radioactivity associated with PTP1B immunoprecipitated from A431 cells that had been stimulated with EGF for 10 min was 27% less than that associated with PTP1B from unstimulated cells. The amount of iodoacetic acid-derived radioactivity associated with PTP1B reached a minimum 10 min after stimulation of cells with EGF and returned to base line values by 40 min, suggesting that the oxidation of PTP1B is reversible in cells. These results indicate that the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase by binding of the corresponding growth factor may not be sufficient to increase the steady state level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cells and that concurrent inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases by H2O2 might also be required."
https://openalex.org/W1993414868,"Although the commonly activated death protease caspase-3 appears not to be essential for apoptosis during development except in the brain, it was not shown whether substrates known to be cleaved by caspase-3 are still proteolyzed in its absence. We have addressed this question with MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells that we recently showed lack caspase-3 owing to the functional deletion of the CASP-3 gene. Tumor necrosis factor- or staurosporine-induced apoptosis of caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells resulted in cleavage of the death substrates PARP, Rb, PAK2, DNA-PKcs, gelsolin, and DFF-45, but not alpha-fodrin. In contrast, all these substrates including alpha-fodrin were cleaved in apoptotic HeLa cells expressing caspase-3. Introduction of CASP-3 cDNA, but not CASP-10 cDNA, into MCF-7 cells restored alpha-fodrin cleavage. In addition, tumor necrosis factor- or staurosporine-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells stably expressing pro-caspase-3 also resulted in alpha-fodrin cleavage. Although the specific caspase inhibitory peptides Z-VAD-fmk and Z-DEVD-fmk prevented apoptosis of MCF-7 cells, we were unable to detect activation of caspases 2 and 7, which are known to be inhibited by Z-DEVD-fmk. Together our results suggest that caspase-3 is essential for cleavage of alpha-fodrin, but dispensable for the cleavage of PARP, Rb, PAK2, DNA-PKcs, gelsolin, and DFF-45 and imply that one or more caspases other than caspases 2, 3, and 7 is activated and plays a crucial role in the cleavage of these substrates in MCF-7 cells."

Peroxisomes are single membrane-bound organelles present in most eukaryotic cells. They participate in a variety of metabolic processes such as lipid metabolism, H2O2-based respiration, production of bile acids and plasmalogens (membrane phospholipids), synthesis of cholesterol, and catabolism of purines, polyamines, and amino acids (1De Duve C.

Indeed, of the three isotypes, PPARα expression is relatively high in hepatocytes, enterocytes, and the proximal convoluted tubular epithelium of kidney (17Huang Q. Yeldandi A.V. Alvares K. Ide H.

It has been postulated that H2O2 overproduced by the sustained transcriptional activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation system and concomitant cell proliferation contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis in livers with peroxisome proliferation (5Reddy J.K.

The peroxisomal β-oxidation system consists of three enzymes, namely H2O2-generating fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX), enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase multifunctional protein (MFP), and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (THL) (3Reddy J.K.

Although peroxisomes and mitochondria catalyze similar reactions, the long chain and very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are oxidized predominantly, if not exclusively, by the peroxisomal β-oxidation system (3Reddy J.K.

Analysis of young AOX-deficient mice revealed extensive microvesicular fatty metamorphosis of liver parenchymal cells and inflammatory reaction (34Fan C-Y. Pan J. Chu R. Lee D. Kluckman K.D. Usuda N.

Hepatic steatosis begins to dissipate gradually, resulting in a liver consisting entirely of regenerative hepatocytes that display massive spontaneous peroxisome proliferation indicative of PPARα activation. Liver tumors develop in AOX-deficient mice by 15 months of age. Our findings implicate AOX as a key regulator of PPARα function and acyl-CoAs (other possible natural substrates of AOX) as potent biological ligands responsible for the transcriptional activation of PPARα in vivo. We utilized the fatty acyl-CoA oxidase null (AOX−/−) mice as described (34Fan C-Y. Pan J. Chu R. Lee D. Kluckman K.D. Usuda N. Singh I. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Maeda N. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

Heterozygous (AOX±) siblings were mated to obtain AOX−/− mice because of reduced fertility of homozygous males and females (34Fan C-Y. Pan J. Chu R. Lee D. Kluckman K.D. Usuda N. Singh I.

Genotypes of mice were determined by Southern blot analysis using DNA isolated from tail tip (34Fan C-Y. Pan J. Chu R. Lee D. Kluckman K.D. Usuda N. Singh I. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Maeda N.

Animal care and experiments were carried out in accordance with both institutional and federal animal care regulations. For routine histology, tissues were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin (pH 7.4) dehydrated in 100% ethanol and embedded in paraffin at 58 °C using standard procedures. Sections (4 μm thick) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemical localization of AOX, MFP, THL, catalase, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), tissues fixed in 10% formalin or 70% ethanol were processed using monospecific polyclonal antibodies. Immunostaining was performed by an avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) or by the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method. Negative controls consisted of staining with normal rabbit serum instead of specific antibodies or by omitting the primary antibodies. The slides were counterstained with either hematoxylin or methyl green. For routine transmission electron microscopy, samples of liver were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 mcacodylate buffer (pH 7.2, 4 °C) for 4 h. They were washed overnight in cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C, and embedded in Epon. For cytochemical localization of catalase, tissue samples were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 h at 4 °C, washed overnight with 0.1% cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), and cut into 60-μm sections. The sections were stained for catalase with alkaline 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 mcacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Semithin sections with or without toluidine blue counterstain were examined by light microscopy. Ultrathin sections for electron microscopy were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For immunogold localization of AOX, MFP, THL, and urate oxidase, tissues were fixed for 24 h by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. The sections were rinsed for 3 h in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 0.1 m lysine, dehydrated in graded series of cold ethanol, and embedded in Lowicryl K4M at –20 °C. Ultrathin sections were stained with each antibody by the protein A-gold technique. The polyclonal antibodies used in these studies were raised in rabbits against rat catalase, rat AOX, rat MFP, rat THL, and rat urate oxidase (35Usuda N. Nakazawa A. Terasawa M. Reddy J.K. Nagata T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from fresh liver or liver frozen at –80 °C using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method. RNA was glyoxylated, separated on 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. cDNA probes used for Northern blotting included AOX, catalase MFP, THL, 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70), urate oxidase (UOX), CYP4A1, CYP4A3, liver FABP, fatty acid synthase (FAS), fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), and ribosomal RNA (28 S). Changes in mRNA levels were estimated by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms. Samples of liver were homogenized (1% w/v) in lysis buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m EDTA, 2% SDS containing 20 mmNaN3 to inhibit endogenous catalase), and H2O2 was measured using the phenol red method (36Pick E. Keisari Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 38: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Information on the generation of AOX−/− mice has been presented previously (34Fan C-Y. Pan J. Chu R. Lee D. Kluckman K.D. Usuda N. Singh I. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Maeda N. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24698-24710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Homozygous AOX−/− mice lacked the expression of AOX protein, accumulated VLCFAs in blood, and exhibited growth retardation during the first six months of age when compared with wild-type (AOX+/+) littermates (34Fan C-Y. Pan J. Chu R. Lee D. Kluckman K.D. Usuda N. Singh I. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Maeda N. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24698-24710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Both male and female AOX−/− mice at four months are infertile, possibly due to retarded growth and development (34Fan C-Y. Pan J. Chu R. Lee D. Kluckman K.D. Usuda N. Singh I. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Maeda N. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24698-24710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For this study, homozygous (AOX−/−) animals were obtained by mating heterozygous (AOX±) mice. At 2 months of age, AOX−/− mice exhibited severe and diffuse fatty metamorphosis of liver, reflecting acute fatty acid hepatotoxicity in younger animals. Scattered hepatocyte death and numerous foci of steatohepatitis are encountered during the first 4 months of age (Fig. 1 A). During the first 2 to 4 months of age, the inflammatory response consisted mostly of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, lipogranulomas, and clusters of foamy macrophages. Death of single hepatocytes (apoptosis) and inflammatory response served as stimuli for progressive liver cell regeneration, resulting in the appearance of multiple clusters of hepatocytes with hypertrophic granular cytoplasm. These regenerated hepatocytes are resistant to fatty change and contained no lipid vacuoles. Few cells with fatty change are sometimes present at the periphery of these newly formed regenerating hepatocyte foci. As the regeneration extended, eosinophilic hepatocyte foci coalesced to form confluent areas of liver regeneration. Thus, between 6 and 8 months of age, almost all steatotic hepatocytes in AOX−/− mice were replaced by hepatocytes devoid of steatosis (Fig. 1 B). Few areas of inflammatory cell collections and large lipid-laden macrophages, some of which are multinucleated, are seen as remnants in a liver that was once steatotic (Fig. 1 B, arrows). Peroxisomes can be identified at the light microscopic level in cytochemically stained sections by the alkaline 3,3-diaminobenzidine procedure for the peroxisomal marker enzyme catalase (1De Duve C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes of AOX+/+ mice, peroxisomes are few, randomly distributed in the cytoplasm, and appeared as diaminobenzidine positive, dark brown granules (Fig. 1 F). Evaluation of 2-to 4-month-old AOX−/− mice revealed a conspicuous absence or paucity of recognizable diaminobenzidine-positive organelles in diffusely steatotic hepatocytes (Fig. 1 C). Since steatosis is extensive in young AOX−/− mice, recognizable peroxisomes are found only in a rare hepatocyte. An occasional hepatocyte with no fatty change displayed an abundance of peroxisomes (Fig. 1 C). As hepatocellular regeneration ensued, the number of hepatocytes lacking steatosis increased, and such cells exhibited conspicuous peroxisome proliferation. As steatosis dissipated in animals six months and older, repopulation of liver occurred with hepatocytes containing eosinophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B). These cells displayed massive spontaneous peroxisome proliferation (Fig. 1, D andE). Ultrastructural analysis of the liver of AOX−/− mice confirmed the increase in the number of peroxisomes in hepatic parenchymal cells (Fig. 2). The magnitude of peroxisome proliferation encountered in these AOX-deficient mice is comparable with that induced in wild-type mice by exogenous peroxisome proliferators such as hypolipidemic drugs Wy-14, 643, clofibrate, and ciprofibrate (4Reddy J.K. Krishnakantha T.P. Science. 1975; 200: 787-789Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 5Reddy J.K. Lalwani N.D. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1983; 12: 1-58Crossref Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Many peroxisomes in hepatocytes of AOX−/− mice revealed the presence of prominent UOX-containing crystalloid cores (Fig. 2 A). PPARα plays a crucial role in the peroxisome proliferation induced in liver by peroxisome proliferators such as clofibrate and Wy-14,643 (25Lee S.S-T Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 37Peters J.M. Cattley R.C. Gonzalez F.J. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 18: 2029-2033Crossref Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in PPARα (PPARα−/−) contain a normal complement of peroxisomes in liver parenchymal cells, but these animals do not exhibit the typical predictable pleiotropic responses, including the development of liver tumors, when treated with peroxisome proliferators (25Lee S.S-T Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 37Peters J.M. Cattley R.C. Gonzalez F.J. Carcinogenesis. 1987; 18: 2029-2033Crossref Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The massive spontaneous peroxisome proliferation observed in AOX-deficient mice in the present study is reminiscent of that encountered in mice exposed to potent peroxisome proliferators such as methyl clofenapate, Wy-14, 643, and ciprofibrate (5Reddy J.K. Lalwani N.D. CRC Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1983; 12: 1-58Crossref Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 27Reddy J.K. Rao M.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1986; 7: 438-443Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This magnitude of spontaneous peroxisome proliferation clearly suggests that PPARα is transcriptionally activated in AOX−/− mice due to increases in the levels of biological (natural) ligands (agonists) of this transcription factor. To further affirm PPARα activation, the structural findings are extended by analysis of the mRNA levels of selected genes in liver that are regulated by PPARα (for review see Refs. 9Reddy J.K. Chu R Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

As shown in Fig. 3, the remaining two genes (down-stream of AOX) of the peroxisomal β-oxidation system, namely MFP and THL, are up-regulated (∼10–30-fold) in AOX−/− mice. The MFP mRNA level showed a remarkable increase in the liver of 2–8-month-old AOX−/− mice (Fig. 3, lanes 3–6) compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 3,lanes 1 and 2). This may be due to the presence of four imperfect TGACCT motifs in the MFP gene promoter, constituting a unique hyper-responsive PPAR-RXR heterodimer binding site (39Chu R. Lin Y. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29636-29639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Significant increases in hepatic CYP4A1 and CYP4A3 mRNA levels are also discerned in AOX−/− mice (Fig. 3). These two members of the CYP4A subfamily encode microsomal fatty acid ω-hydroxylases, and an increase in the activity of this enzyme system is a component of the peroxisome proliferator-induced pleiotropic responses in liver (7Reddy J.K. Goel S.K. Nemali M.R. Carrino J.J. Laffler T.G. Reddy M.K. Sperbeck S.J. Osumi T. Hashimoto S. Lalwani N.D. Rao M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mRNA levels of both ACS and PMP70 increased markedly in the liver of AOX−/− mice, with spontaneous peroxisome proliferation (Fig. 3). The mRNA level of FAS, which catalyzes seven reactions involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to palmitate (44Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7049-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is also increased in the liver of 2-to-8-month-old AOX−/− mice (Fig. 3). This increase is most marked in 6- and 8-month-old mice. Modest increases in liver FABP (∼3–4-fold increase), UOX (∼2–4-fold), and catalase (∼ 2-fold) mRNA levels occurred in the liver of AOX−/− mice (Fig. 3). The basal levels of these three mRNAs in wild-type mice are relatively high when compared with low basal expression of genes encoding the β-oxidation system, CYP4A subfamily, PMP70, ACS, and FAS (Fig. 3). To determine whether alterations in mRNA levels of MFP, THL, PMP70, and UOX represent changes in protein concentration at the peroxisome level, localization of these proteins was investigated by immunoelectron microscopy using the protein A-gold procedure (35Usuda N. Nakazawa A. Terasawa M. Reddy J.K. Nagata T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The matrix of peroxisomes proliferating spontaneously in AOX−/− mouse liver revealed numerous gold particles when stained with antibodies against MFP and THL, whereas hepatic peroxisomes of normal wild-type mice displayed only a few gold particles (data not shown). UOX and PMP70 staining is localized exclusively to the crystalloid cores and to the peroxisome membranes, respectively (not illustrated). Catalase has been localized to the matrix of all peroxisomes in hepatocytes of AOX−/− mice (not shown). Immunoblot analysis of liver homogenates confirmed increases in the content of MFP, THL, UOX, and PMP70 in AOX−/− mouse liver with spontaneous peroxisome proliferation (results not shown). Hepatocellular adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas developed in AOX−/− mice between 10 and 15 months of age (Fig. 4,A and B). By 15 months of age all AOX−/− mice developed hepatocellular carcinomas with solid, trabecular, acinar, or fibrolamellar histological patterns. No metastases to lungs or other sites were detected in AOX−/− mice killed by 15 months. Hepatic adenomas generally preceded the appearance of hepatocellular carcinomas. These adenomas and carcinomas showed reduced staining for MFP, THL, and catalase when"
https://openalex.org/W2065365814,"We have cloned and characterized the first human isozyme in a new family of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, PDE9A. By sequence homology in the catalytic domain, PDE9A is almost equidistant from all eight known mammalian PDE families but is most similar to PDE8A (34% amino acid identity) and least like PDE5A (28% amino acid identity). We report the cloning of human cDNA encoding a full-length protein of 593 amino acids, including a 261-amino acid region located near the C terminus that is homologous to the ∼270-amino acid catalytic domain of other PDEs. PDE9A is expressed in all eight tissues examined as a ∼2.0-kilobase mRNA, with highest levels in spleen, small intestine, and brain. The full-length PDE9A was expressed in baculovirus fused to an N-terminal 9-amino acid FLAG tag. Kinetic analysis of the baculovirus-expressed enzyme shows it to be a very high affinity cGMP-specific PDE with a K m of 170 nm for cGMP and 230 μm for cAMP. TheK m for cGMP makes PDE9A one of the highest affinity PDEs known. The V max for cGMP (4.9 nmol/min/μg recombinant enzyme) is about twice as fast as that of PDE4 for cAMP. The enzyme is about twice as active in vitroin 1–10 mm Mn2+ than in the same concentration of Mg2+ or Ca2+. PDE9A is insensitive (up to 100 μm) to a variety of PDE inhibitors including rolipram, vinpocetine, SKF-94120, dipyridamole, and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine but is inhibited (IC50 = 35 μm) by zaprinast, a PDE5 inhibitor. PDE9A lacks a region homologous to the allosteric cGMP-binding regulatory regions found in the cGMP-binding PDEs: PDE2, PDE5, and PDE6.

Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, 3′:5′ cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EST, expressed sequence tag; kb, kilobase(s); IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine; SKF-95120, 5-(4-acetamidophenyl) pyrazin-2-(1H)-one; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. which hydrolyze the intracellular second messengers cAMP and cGMP to their corresponding monophosphates, play an important role in signal transduction by regulating the intracellular concentration of cyclic nucleotides. Eight families of mammalian PDEs have been defined based on sequence similarity, substrate specificity, affinity, sensitivity to cofactors, and sensitivity to inhibitory drugs (1Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). 2Fisher, D. A., Smith, J. F., Pillar, J. S., St. Denis, S. H., and Cheng, J. B., (1998)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 246, in press. These families are: PDE1, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent; PDE2, cGMP-stimulated; PDE3, cGMP-inhibited; PDE4, cAMP-specific; PDE5, cGMP-specific; PDE6, photoreceptor cGMP-specific; PDE7, cAMP-specific rolipram-insensitive; and PDE8, cAMP-specific IBMX-insensitive. Within families, there are multiple isozymes and multiple splice variants of those isozymes. PDEs are composed of a catalytic domain of ∼270 amino acids, an N-terminal regulatory domain responsible for binding cofactors, and in some cases, a C-terminal domain of unknown function. Within the catalytic domain, there is approximately 30% amino acid identity between PDE families and ∼85–95% identity between isozymes of the same family (e.g. PDE4A versus PDE4B). Furthermore, within a family there is extensive similarity (>60%) outside the catalytic domain, whereas across families there is little or no sequence similarity. The existence of multiple PDE families, isozymes, and splice variants presents an opportunity for complex regulation of cyclic nucleotide levels. To better understand this regulation and to identify the molecules responsible, we have looked for novel cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. In this study, we describe the cloning, tissue distribution, expression, and pharmacology of a new human high affinity cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase. Sequence comparisons with the published PDEs and its pharmacological properties show that this enzyme, PDE9A, defines a new family of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. The murine homologue of PDE9A has been simultaneously and independently cloned by others and is being submitted as a separate report (2Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One EST clone was identified by searching the Incyte EST data base (Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc., Palo Alto, CA) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (4Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W.

Novel clones were sequenced using PCR-based fluorescent sequencing on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 373 sequencer. 3 μg of human poly(A)+RNA (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) from eight tissues was electrophoresed through a 1% formaldehyde agarose denaturing gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with a32P-labeled probe composed of the 5′-most 1090 nucleotides of Incyte clone 828,228 (nucleotides 809–1899 in Fig. 2). Probe DNA was labeled with 32P using the “Ready-To-Go” random prime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed to a stringency of 0.5 × SSC, 65 °C. For the mouse Northern blot, this probe was hybridized to a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) and washed to a stringency of 1 × SSC, 65 °C. cDNA sequences were extended by PCR amplification from human λgt10 testis or stomach cDNA library DNA (CLONTECH) using nested primers. Briefly, 2.5 × 107 plaque-forming unit/reaction was boiled for 5 min to release DNA from the phage particles and chilled on ice. The first round of PCR (15 cycles) was performed with a PDE9A gene-specific primer (9A-specific outer: 5′-GACACAGAACAGCCACCTC-3′, nucleotides 966–950) and either a gt10 forward (5′-TCGCTTAGTTTTACCGTTTTC-3′ or a gt10 reverse (5′-TATCGCCTCCATCAACAAACTT-3′) primer. 150 of the reaction was used as template for a second round of PCR (30 cycles) with a nested PDE9A gene-specific primer (9A-specific inner: 5′-GGGTGACAGGGTTGATGCT-3′, nucleotides 945–927) with either a nested gt10 forward (5′-AGCAAGTTCAGCCTGGTTAAG-3′) or gt10 reverse (5′-CTTATGAGTATTTCTTCCAGGGTA-3′) primer. PCR primers were chosen (Oligo 5.0 primer analysis software, National Biosciences, Inc., Plymouth, MN) to be efficient at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. 5′ RACE (7Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) was performed to extend the sequence using human brain mRNA (CLONTECH) as template and the 5′ RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PDE9A-specific primers used in the 5′ RACE were: reverse transcriptase primer, 5′-GCTCCTCCCTCATCTTCTTA-3′ (nucleotides 694–675); outer primer, 5′-AGGACAGCCAAGTGATTT-3′ (nucleotides 611–594); and inner primer, 5′-TGCGCTGGCCTTCCTGGTAG-3′ (nucleotides 493–474). All sequences that were subsequently incorporated into the PDE9A sequence were verified by sequencing multiple independent PCR amplification products from either cDNA library DNA or from brain cDNA using unique primers. A 1.8-kb region of PDE9A containing the full-length coding region (nucleotides 61–1842) was PCR amplified using the following primers: 5′ primer (nucleotides 8–25) = 5′-GCTGGCGTCGGGAAAGTA-3′ and 3′ primer (nucleotides 1825–1842) 5′-CGTCGACTTATTAGGCACAGTCTCCTTC-3′. The latter primer converts the TAG stop codon to a double TAA stop codon for more reliable termination and also adds a SalI site at the 3′ end of the PCR fragment for cloning purposes. The fragment was subcloned into T-vector (Promega Biotech) and sequence verified, and the 1.8-kbBamHI-SalI fragment containing the full-length coding region was then cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pFASTBAC (Life Technologies, Inc.), which had been modified to include a 5′ FLAG tag (8Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final N terminus of the recombinant protein is predicted to be MDYKDDDDKGSGSSSYR, where the underlined FLAG tag replaces the native start codon. Recombinant virus stocks were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf900 II Sfm serum free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 27 °C. For expression, 1 × 108 Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 in a final volume of 50 ml. Two days post infection, the cells were harvested, and enzyme-containing lysates were prepared as detailed below under “Enzyme Preparation.” To monitor expression, 1 μl of mock infected and PDE9A-infected lysate were electrophoresed in a polyacrylamide gel and either silver-stained by standard methods or transferred to nitrocellulose and Western blotted with an anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT) at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. The secondary antibody was an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Boehringer Mannheim), and the blot was visualized with a BCIP/NBT phosphatase substrate system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mmEDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5) at 1 × 107cells/ml and disrupted using a Branson sonicating probe (3 × 10 s pulses). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was stored at −70 °C until used. PDE activity was measured as described (9Thompson W.J. Brooker G. Appleman M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: a one-step assay was run using a 100-μl assay volume containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 unit of 5′ nucleotidase (from Crotalus atrox venom), 0.064–0.1 μm [3H]cGMP or [3H]cAMP, and various concentrations of cold cyclic nucleotide to give the final concentration range for each: cGMP (0.064–2 μm) or cAMP (3–300 μm). The reaction was started by the addition of 25 μl of appropriately diluted enzyme supernatant. Reactions were run directly in mini Poly-Q scintillation vials (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA). Assays were incubated at 37 °C for a time period that would give less than 15% cGMP (or cAMP) hydrolysis to avoid nonlinearity associated with product inhibition. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of Dowex AG1x8 (Cl form) resin (1:3 slurry). 3 ml of Ready Safe scintillant (Beckman) were added, and the vials were well mixed. The vials were allowed to settle for 1 h before counting. When inhibitors were tested, all reactions contained 1% Me2SO and were done at a cGMP substrate concentration of 150 nm. The assay blank contained all reagents minus the enzyme aliquot. The level of PDE activity was so high in PDE9A-infected insect cells (≥ 200× higher than in mock infected cells) that the amount of basal insect cell cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis was considered negligible and ignored. At the dilutions used, the amount of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis by the mock infected insect cell lysate was not significantly different from the no enzyme assay blank. Dipyridamole and IBMX were purchased from Sigma. SKF-94120 was a gift from the SmithKline & French Laboratories. Rolipram, zaprinast, and vinpocetin were synthesized at Pfizer Inc. Bioinformatic screening of the Incyte data base yielded one EST clone homologous to the catalytic domain of PDE4B that was not identical to any known PDE. The identified clone, Incyte 828,228 (Fig. 1), was isolated from a prostate cDNA library. The clone sequence was extended in the 5′ direction using nested PCR from a testis cDNA library. This approach gave a 700-nucleotide PCR fragment that extended the sequence 600 nucleotides in the 5′ direction (Fig. 1) but did not give a full-length sequence. 5′ RACE from brain cDNA yielded fragments terminating at the beginning of the sequence shown in Fig. 2. To verify that the putative coding region (nucleotides 61–1842) is expressed as a contiguous fragment and to make an expression construct, this region was PCR amplified from human brain (medulla) cDNA and sequence verified. Assembly of the clone and PCR sequences gives the 1991-nucleotide cDNA sequence shown in Fig. 2. The first 1839 nucleotides of this sequence contains an open reading frame that could encode a 613-amino acid polypeptide. However, as discussed below, it appears that the first methionine codon (beginning at nucleotide 61) is a natural start codon, making the PDE9A cDNA encode a full-length protein of 593 amino acids. This sequence includes a 261-amino acid region near its C terminus (amino acids 288–548, underlined in Fig. 2) with homology to the ∼270-amino acid catalytic domain of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (Fig. 3). The rank order of similarity of this region to the other eight PDE families is as follows (% amino acid identity): PDE8A (34.4%), PDE7 (31.7%), PDE4 (31.3%), PDE1 (31.3%), PDE3 (30.1%), PDE2 (29.8%), PDE6 (28.9%), and PDE5 (27.8%). This level of similarity is the same as that seen between the catalytic domains of the eight known PDE families and does not approach the >85% similarity seen between isozymes of the same family (e.g. 92% between PDE4A and PDE4B). Outside the catalytic domain, there is little or no sequence similarity with any other known PDE. Therefore, by sequence homology, this sequence represents a new family of PDE, which we denote as hsPDE9A2 in accordance with the nomenclature of the 1994 American Society of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Conference (10Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar). The human cDNA is noted as the second splice variant of PDE9A to distinguish it from a different splice variant seen in the murine homologue of PDE9A (mmPDE9A1), described in the accompanying paper (2Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15553-15558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows an alignment of the catalytic domain of PDE9A with members of the other eight known mammalian PDE families. The clustering of sequence identity seen between the other eight PDE families also occurs in PDE9A. For example, of 22 amino acids conserved among all eight other PDE families, 21 are also conserved in PDE9A. The one change is a very conservative Tyr to Phe change at amino acid 24 of the catalytic domain (amino acid 311 in Fig. 2). Two divalent cation-binding motifs (HisXaa3HisXaa24–26Glu) thought to be critical to the catalytic activity of PDEs (11Francis S.H. Colbran J.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22477-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kleinman E.F. Campbell E. Giordano L.A. Cohan V.L. Jenkinson T.H. Cheng J.B. Shirley J.T. Pettipher E.R. Salter E.D. Hibbs T.A. DiCapua F.M. Border J. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) are conserved in PDE9A, with the exception that the glutamic acid of the first motif has been changed to aspartic acid (amino acid 341), another conservative change that is allowed in at least two other functional enzymes, PDE7A and PDE8A. All the features noted above are also conserved in the murine PDE9A sequence, which shares 93.5% amino acid sequence identity with the human sequence in the catalytic domain (2Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15553-15558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis with a PDE9A probe gives a single band of ∼2.0 kb that is most abundant in spleen, small intestine, and brain mRNA (Fig. 4). However, the same sized mRNA is seen in all tissues examined to date, suggesting that PDE9A is broadly expressed. It remains to be shown if the quantitative differences between tissues will prove to be of any functional significance. We have also confirmed that human PDE9A cross-hybridizes with murine PDE9A. The human PDE9A probe also detects only a 2.0-kb mRNA in a Northern blot of eight mouse tissues (data not shown). This is the same result seen with a mouse probe against a mouse Northern blot in the accompanying paper (2Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15553-15558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Full-length PDE9A (amino acids 2–593) was expressed in insect cells with a 9-amino acid N-terminal FLAG tag (8Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to assist in detection. Lysates made from infected Sf9 cells showed a new band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼75 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2), which is in reasonable agreement with the 69.4-kDa molecular mass predicted for the FLAG-PDE9A fusion protein. Furthermore, this band comigrates with the only major protein that is positive in an anti-FLAG Western blot (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). The amount of PDE9A expressed in the baculovirus lysate was estimated by comparison with a serial dilution of a known mass of bovine serum albumin on a silver-stained gel (data not shown). From this, we estimate the amount of PDE9A expressed to be 70 μg/107infected Sf9 cells. Recombinant PDE9A was identified as a catalytically active protein in that lysates from PDE9A-infected Sf9 cells expressed 200-fold greater cGMP hydrolyzing activity than mock infected cells. Further, this activity could be immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-coated beads, indicating that the cGMP hydrolyzing activity was specifically associated with the FLAG-PDE9A fusion protein. To determine the K m and V maxof the enzyme, the rate of hydrolysis of cGMP and cAMP was measured at a variety of substrate concentrations using a very dilute enzyme preparation. Fig. 6 shows a Lineweaver-Burk plot of cGMP hydrolysis by PDE9A (13Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976: 233-236Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of the baculovirus-expressed enzyme displayed standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics (r2 = 0.95) with aK m of 170 nm and aV max of 4.9 nmol/min/μg of recombinant protein. Similar analysis reveals that the affinity for cAMP was >1000-fold lower, with a K m of 230 μm. To compare the activity of PDE9A with other known cAMP PDE enzymes, we expressed a human GST-PDE4A fusion protein and measured cAMP hydrolysis using identical expression and enzyme assay conditions. The PDE4A expressed in baculovirus showed a high affinity for cAMP with a K m of 2.4 μm and aV max of 2.2 nmol/min/μg of recombinant protein. Therefore, PDE9A has a 2-fold fasterV max for cGMP than that of PDE4A for cAMP. Like that of other PDEs, PDE9A activity is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, consistent with the role metal ions are thought to play in catalysis and the presence of conserved metal-binding sites in that catalytic domain (11Francis S.H. Colbran J.L. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22477-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kleinman E.F. Campbell E. Giordano L.A. Cohan V.L. Jenkinson T.H. Cheng J.B. Shirley J.T. Pettipher E.R. Salter E.D. Hibbs T.A. DiCapua F.M. Border J. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 7shows PDE9A activity at Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ concentrations from 100 μm to 100 mm. Maximal activity is achieved at Mn2+concentrations of 1–10 mm, whereas Mg2+ or Ca2+ restores only ∼50% of this activity. To determine whether PDE8A activity is affected by any known PDE inhibitors, a dose-response curve against a panel of these agents was performed (Fig. 8). These inhibitors (PDEs that they inhibit in parenthesis) include rolipram (PDE4), SKF-94120 (PDE3), zaprinast (PDE5, 6), vinpocetine (PDE1), dipyridamole (PDE2, 4, 5, 6), and IBMX (nonspecific PDE). All the PDE inhibitors were inactive up to 100 μm with the exception of zaprinast, which had an IC50 of 35 μm. The existence of multiple cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase families makes possible complex regulation of cyclic nucleotide levels. An elucidation of all such enzymes gives us tools to better understand cyclic nucleotide signal transduction, as well possible targets for pharmacological intervention once the biological relevance and any potential role in disease is established for each enzyme. Human PDE9A represents the first human member of a new family of cGMP-specific PDE. Kinetic analysis shows PDE9A to be a very high affinity cGMP PDE with a 1000-fold higher affinity for cGMP (K m = 170 nm) than for cAMP (K m = 240 μm). Its lack of significant sequence homology with the eight other known mammalian PDE families outside the catalytic domain and 28–34% sequence identity within the catalytic domain is consistent with its assignment as a new family. Furthermore, PDE9A has an inhibitor profile unique among other known PDEs. Unlike the cGMP-binding PDEs (PDE2, PDE5, and PDE6), the putative regulatory domain of PDE9A does not contain sequences homologous to the ∼80-amino acid cGMP-binding regions that can serve as allosteric regulatory sites. Presumably, therefore, all binding of cGMP to PDE9A is at the catalytic site. Among all previously published PDE sequences, PDE9A is most similar in the catalytic domain to a D. discoideum protein, RegA, that was identified genetically as a suppressor of an intracellular signaling defect (14Shaulsky G. Escalante R. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15260-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). RegA has 40.6% amino acid identity with human PDE9A in the catalytic domain, which is greater than the 31–35% identity that RegA has with the other eight families of known mammalian PDEs. However, this similarity is far too low to consider PDE9A and RegA members of one PDE family. Consistent with this, PDE9A has little or no sequence similarity with RegA outside the catalytic domain. In addition, PDE9A and RegA are not functional homologues, because the two enzymes have very different properties: RegA is a cAMP-specific PDE with a K m of 5 μm (15Loomis W.F. Shaulsky G. Wang N. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PDE9A is a much higher affinity cGMP-specific PDE. A murine homologue of hsPDE9A2 with similar substrate specificity, kinetic properties, and inhibitor profile has been cloned simultaneously and is reported in the accompanying paper (2Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15553-15558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The murine and human cDNAs share 93.5% amino acid identity in the catalytic domain. The primary difference between the sequences is the presence of 60 amino acids (amino acids 88–147 in Fig. 2) in the human PDE9A putative regulatory domain (amino acids 1–287) that are absent in the splice variant cloned in mouse. This suggests that alternate splicing of the putative regulatory domain is likely to occur in PDE9A, because it has been observed in other PDE families, where it can alter membrane targeting (16Shakur Y. Pryde J.G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and interaction with the v-Src SH3 domain (17O'Connell J.C. McCallum J.F. McPhee I. Wakefield J. Houslay E.S. Wishart W. Bolger G. Frame M. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PDE9A regulatory domain is otherwise 98% identical between the species, clearly indicating that these are two members of the same PDE family and almost certainly homologues of the same isozyme. Analysis of the DNA sequence of PDE9A, including comparison with the murine sequence, indicates that we have obtained the coding sequence for a full-length 593-amino acid polypeptide. Both the human and mouse cDNAs predict the same start codon, which is flanked by sequences with a reasonable match for those found around eukaryotic initiator codons (18Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). Also, both cDNA sequences contain virtually all of the 2 kb mRNA seen in Northern blot experiments. Although there is only one amino acid substitution between species in the first 82 amino acids of these two polypeptides, all three amino acids predicted by the 9 known nucleotides upstream of the murine start codon are different between the two species, indicating that this is untranslated region. This observation strengthens the assignment of this as the start codon in both species. Because the 15-nucleotide poly(A) sequence at the 3′ end of Incyte clone 828,228 is not preceded by a polyadenylation signal (19Proudfoot N.J. Cheng C.C. Brownlee G.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1976; 19: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it is that there could be a small amount of additional human 3′-untranslated region beyond that shown in Fig. 2. It is worthwhile to point out that because alternatively spliced versions of human PDE9A probably exist, the molecular mass of PDE9A in any given tissue may not agree with that predicted from the sequence in Fig. 2. Although this sequence appears to be the most abundant form in human brain (medulla), further studies will be needed to correlate the specific molecular mass protein form expressed in various tissues. The 5′-untranslated region of human PDE9A contains GC-rich sequences capable of folding back and forming a hairpin loop. The 18-nucleotide regions capable of base pairing are indicated in Fig. 2 witharrows to indicate their orientation and withdots to show the paired nucleotides. The central 9 of 9 nucleotide match is calculated to have a 49 °C melting temperature under physiological salt conditions (165 mm NaCl) (Oligo 5.0 primer analysis software, National Biosciences, Inc., Plymouth, MN). This raises the possibility that PDE9A protein expression may be at least partially regulated at the translational level, because the presence of hairpin structures in the 5′-untranslated region would be expected to inhibit translation. Ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme involved in polyamine synthesis, is one example of an mRNA whose translation is profoundly affected by a hairpin structure in the 5′-untranslated region and whose translation efficiency is regulated by its enzymatic products (20Grens A. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11810-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be shown whether the potential hairpin structure in the PDE9A 5′-untranslated region is biologically relevant. The lack of PDE9A inhibition by most PDE inhibitors is not surprising given the low degree of sequence identity in the catalytic domain. Although the cGMP-binding pocket is probably highly conserved, there is already excellent precedent for family-specific inhibitors through examples such as rolipram. Rolipram inhibits PDE4 but not any other PDE family, including the other cAMP-specific PDEs, PDE7 and PDE8A. Pharmacological precedence and the large sequence differences between the catalytic domain of PDE9A and other known PDEs is highly favorable for efforts to find a PDE9A-selective inhibitor that would be valuable in exploring the biology of this enzyme. The biological role of PDE9A is not presently known. Its broad tissue distribution does not suggest a role in a specific signal transduction pathway. The high affinity of PDE9A for cGMP, 20 and 100 times higher than that of PDE5 and PDE6, respectively (21Francis S.H. Lincoln T.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 620-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggests to us that PDE9A may be functioning in cells at lower cGMP concentrations than the other two cGMP PDEs. More detailed studies on the localization of PDE9A and studies with PDE9A-selective inhibitors may be informative in dissecting what cGMP-driven processes are regulated by this enzyme. We are grateful to Alison Williams, Lisa Hayes, and Suzanne Williams of the DNA sequencing lab for expert technical assistance and to Katherine Cole and Dr. Steve Phillips for helpful comments on the manuscript. Thanks to Dr. Joe Beavo for sharing unpublished data and coordinating with us on the nomenclature of the human and mouse PDE9A and PDE8A gene families."
https://openalex.org/W2150258341,"We report the cloning, expression, and characterization of a new family of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) that has unique kinetic and inhibitor specificities. A clone corresponding to the C terminus of this PDE was initially identified by a bioinformatic approach and used to isolate a cDNA that is likely full-length. This novel PDE, designated as MMPDE9A1, shows highest mRNA expression in kidney with lower levels in liver, lung, and brain. The mRNA size by Northern blot analysis is approximately 2.0 kilobases, and the cDNA encoding PDE9A1 is 1929 base pairs in length. The largest open reading frame predicts a protein of 534 amino acids with a molecular mass of 62,000 Da. When expressed in COS-7 cells, PDE9A1 activity was not inhibited well by either the nonselective inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine or the new selective PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, but it is inhibited by the PDE1/5 inhibitor (+)-cis-5,6a,7,8,9 hyl] phenylmethyl]-5-methyl-cylopent[4,5]imidao[2,1-b]purin-49(3H)one (SCH51866) with an IC50 of 1.55 μm. This new phosphodiesterase is highly specific for cGMP. ItsK m of ∼0.07 μm for cGMP is the lowest yet reported for a PDE, being at least 40–170 times lower than that of PDE5 and PDE6, respectively. We report the cloning, expression, and characterization of a new family of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) that has unique kinetic and inhibitor specificities. A clone corresponding to the C terminus of this PDE was initially identified by a bioinformatic approach and used to isolate a cDNA that is likely full-length. This novel PDE, designated as MMPDE9A1, shows highest mRNA expression in kidney with lower levels in liver, lung, and brain.

When expressed in COS-7 cells, PDE9A1 activity was not inhibited well by either the nonselective inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine or the new selective PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, but it is inhibited by the PDE1/5 inhibitor (+)-cis-5,6a,7,8,9 hyl] phenylmethyl]-5-methyl-cylopent[4,5]imidao[2,1-b]purin-49(3H)one (SCH51866) with an IC50 of 1.55 μm. This new phosphodiesterase is highly specific for cGMP. ItsK m of ∼0.07 μm for cGMP is the lowest yet reported for a PDE, being at least 40–170 times lower than that of PDE5 and PDE6, respectively. The cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP serve as second messengers for a wide variety of extracellular signals such as neurotransmitters, hormones, light, and odorants. The diverse cellular and behavioral responses to these second messengers are mediated by the action of cAMP and cGMP on their intracelluar targets, which include kinases, ion channels, transcriptional activators, and several isoforms of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). 1The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; EST, expressed sequence tag; kb, kilobase(s); SCH 51866, (+)-cis-5,6a,7,8,9 hyl] phenylmethyl]-5-methyl-cylopent[4,5]imidao[2,1-b]purin-49(3H)one; ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid. Accordingly, these responses are regulated by the rates of synthesis of cyclic nucleotides by cyclases and their degradation by PDEs to biologically inactive 5′ monophosphate nucleosides. Seven 2Note that an eighth family of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases has also been identified by our lab and by Fisher et al. Fisher, D. A., Smith, J. F., Pillar, J. S., St. Denis, S. H., and Cheng, J. B. (1998) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 246, in press. different gene families of PDEs previously have been isolated based on their distinct kinetic and substrate characteristics, inhibitor profiles, allosteric activators and inhibitors, and amino acid sequence (1Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). Family 1 is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin and hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP; family 2 is stimulated by cGMP, and both cAMP and cGMP serve as substrate; family 3 is distinguished by cAMP hydrolysis that is inhibited by cGMP; family 4 is cAMP-specific; family 5 binds cGMP at a noncatalytic site and specifically hydrolyzes cGMP; family 6 is the retinal PDE that is inhibited by a γ subunit in the absence of activated transducin and hydrolyzes cGMP; and family 7 is a very lowK m cAMP-specific PDE. Not only does each family of PDE have specialized substrate and regulatory features, but each PDE family and even members within a family also exhibit tissue-, cell-, and subcell-specific expression patterns and therefore participate in distinct signal transduction pathways. The precise cellular and subcellular profile of PDE expression then will determine the cyclic nucleotide phenotype of a cell and how it responds to first messengers. Identifying and characterizing these functionally distinct PDEs is therefore crucial for our understanding of the mechanisms by which cyclic nucleotides moderate their biologic effects. We report here the cloning, expression, and characterization of a previously unknown PDE designated as MMPDE9A1 (2Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar). This PDE represents a new gene family because it shares less than 50% amino acid identity in the conserved catalytic domain with the other seven PDE families. A search of GenBank™ reveals that PDE9A1 has slightly higher sequence homology to a recently described Dictyostelium discoideumPDE referred to as RegA (3Shaulsky G. Escalante R. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15260-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) rather than other mammalian PDEs. Additionally, expression of PDE9A1 in COS cells results in functional PDE activity that is unique kinetically from the other seven families in that it is cGMP-specific and has the lowest K mfor cGMP reported so far for a PDE. The amino acid sequence of MMPDE1A2 was used as a query to search the data base of expressed sequence tags (4Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 5Hillier L.D. et al.Genome Res. 1996; 6: 807-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The program used was the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (6Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) accessed from the data base search and analysis Search Launcher (7Smith R.F. Wiese B.A. Wojzynski M.K. Davison D.B. Worley K.C. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 454-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This search resulted in many EST sequences with homology to the PDE1A2 query. Each of these EST sequences were then used as queries in a BLASTN search of GenBank™ to determine whether they represented different but known PDEs or whether the EST sequence represented a truly unknown PDE. EST clone identification number 404030 was isolated in this manner as a sequence that appeared to represent a novel PDE. Clone 404030 was ordered from the American Type Culture Collection. Clones 420451 was ordered from Genome Systems, Inc. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the SNAP kit (Invitrogen). Primers were designed using the program Amplify (freeware by William Engels, Genetics Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Sequencing was done using ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer), and sequencing reactions were purified using Centri-sep columns (Princeton Separations). Sequences were assembled using the program Sequencher 3.0 (Gene Codes Corporation). The primers used were: Krace.S1, gcgatgggggccggctcctcaagctac; 4040AS2, gtttcaaacattgggatcaggacaaac; PDE9stp.AS2, ccacaattcatctgctctaactggtacagtc; PDE9stp.AS1, cctgggaagcctcgcttggctctgtccac; Gal4ActAS.pri, gaaattgagatggtgcacgatgcacag; AP1, ccatcctaatacgactcactatagggc AP2, actcactatagggctcgagcggc. DNA probes were generated from EST clone 404030 and B-actin using Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). [α-32P]dCTP at 6000 Ci/mmol was used, and the reaction product was purified using Centri-sep columns. Multiple tissue mRNA blot was purchased fromCLONTECH. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing was done according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Hybridization was done using 2 × 106 cpm/ml in a final volume of 20 ml at 42 °C overnight. EST clone 404030 was used to screen approximately 700,000 plaques from a mouse kidney λgT10 cDNA library (CLONTECH). Briefly, the library was incubated with an overnight culture of c600Hfl Escherichia coli and plated onto NZY plates with NZY plus top agarose and incubated for 8 h. Plates were then stored overnight at 4 °C. Nitrocellulose filters were placed on top of these plates for 3 min in duplicate and denatured for 5 min in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5n NaOH followed by neutralization in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 5 min again. Filters were then rinsed in 2× SSC, air dried, and UV cross-linked (0.15 J/cm2). Filters were then prewetted in 2× SSC and then incubated in hybridization solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 m NaCl) for 1 h at 65 °C. 5 × 106 cpm/ml of boiled probe was added, and hybridization was continued overnight. Filters were then washed in 2× SSPE for 15 min twice at room temperature and then twice in 0.1× SSPE, 0.5% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. Filters were then exposed to autoradiographic film overnight, and positive plaques were picked and stored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 2% gelatin until further rounds of screening were done. This resulted in two independent clones, clones 2.1 and 6.1, which were identical and contained the sequence of EST clone 404030 in addition to a polyadenine tail, representing the full 3′ end of PDE9. Additionally, primers 4040AS2 and a primer against the multiple cloning site, Gal4ActAS.pri, were used in a screen by polymerase chain reaction of 6 × 106 colony forming units of a rat brain pGAD10 library (CLONTECH) for sequences 5′′ to the 404030 sequence. This resulted in a clone that contained additional 5′ end sequence but still was missing the start methionine. This rat sequence was then used to “walk” the EST data base, looking for new EST clones that contained additional 5′ end sequence. This resulted in clone ID 420451, which contains the start methionine but is 3′ truncated at nucleotide 1,446 because of an internal NotI site in PDE9. Marathon-adapted cDNA and Advantage polymerase PCR mix was purchased from CLONTECH. Reactions were set up as follows: 0.5 ng of adapted cDNA, 0.2 μm AP1 or AP2 primer, 0.2 μm gene-specific primer, 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer (supplied with Advantage polymerase), 0.2 mm dNTP, and 1 μl of Advantage KlenTaq Polymerase mix in a final volume of 50 μl. Reaction cycles were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 4 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 4 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 4 min. ANotI/HindIII fragment from the mouse kidney clone 6.1 was subcloned into a NotI/HindIII digest of clone 420451 to insert the 3′ end of PDE9A1 missing from this otherwise full-length clone because of an internal NotI site and the use of NotI in library construction for clone 420451. This generated a full-length PDE9A1 cDNA. This was subcloned into PCR3.1 (Invitrogen) by amplifying 0.5 μg of full-length PDE9A1 for 10 cycles using primers Krace.S1 and PDEstp.AS2. NotI digests were used to select for clones with PDE9A1 in the correct orientation. The cDNA as reported here has been confirmed to exist as a single mRNA species by PCR of kidney cDNA using primers Krace.S1 and PDE9.stp.AS1 (Fig. 1). PDE9A1 cDNA subcloned in PCR3.1 was purified using Qiagen tip-500 columns. 10 μg of DNA was electroporated into 2 × 106 COS-7 cells/plate in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette at 250 microfarad and infinite resistance using 300 V, 50 watts, and 50 mA. The same amount of PCDNA-3 vector (Invitrogen) alone was also transfected under the same conditions as a negative control for expression. Four plates for each construct were transfected and plated onto 100-mm dishes and kept in 5% CO2 for 24 h. After this period fresh medium was added, and cells were placed in 10% CO2 for another 24–48 h. Each set of four plates was pooled and harvested in 4 ml of homogenization buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 15 mm benzamidine; 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; 1 μg/ml pepstatin A; 1 μg/ml leupeptin; and 5 mm EDTA. This was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer on ice with 25 strokes, and then 1 volume of glycerol was added. This preparation was stored at −70 °C in aliquots and did not lose appreciable activity over 2 months. All PDE assays were done according to the method of Hansen and Beavo (8Hansen R.S. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2788-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.8 mm EGTA, 15.0 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and [3H]cGMP (25,000 cpm/reaction) in a final volume of 250 μl. All assays were done in triplicate, and reaction times and enzyme amounts were kept such that the lowest substrate concentration gave no more than 30% hydrolysis. PDE9 activity is defined as the total specific activity in PDE9-transfected COS cells minus the background specific activity of mock transfected COS cells. cGMP hydrolytic activity was approximately 8–16-fold higher in PDE9-transfected cells compared with mock transfected cells at 1 μm cGMP and approximately 50-fold higher at 0.06–0.1 μm cGMP. Thus the basal cGMP hydrolytic activity in COS-7 cells was not a significant contributor to the total activity in PDE9-transfected cells. Inhibitor studies were done without added unlabeled cGMP to keep the final substrate concentration low so that IC50 values would approximate the K i value. IBMX, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine, and dipyridamole were obtained from Sigma. Zaprinast was a gift from May & Baker LTD, UK. Rolipram was obtained from BioMol (Plymoth Meeting, PA). SCH 51866 was a gift from Schering-Plow Research Institute, and sildenafil was a gift from Pfizer Central Research (Sandwich, UK). Enoximone was a gift from the Merrell Dow Research Institute. We have cloned and characterized a cDNA encoding a new cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase that represents a previously unknown gene family. A partial cDNA representing this novel PDE, which had low but significant homology to the C terminus of calmodulin PDE MMPDE1A2, was initially isolated from the data base of expressed sequence tags. This sequence (mouse embryo EST clone 404030) did not match any GenBank™ PDE sequence with high homology but did match PDEs in general better than other GenBank™ sequences, suggesting that this sequence may represent a PDE of a new family. This EST was used to probe a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot to assess tissue distribution and mRNA size. (Fig. 2) Northern blot analysis indicates that mRNA representing this EST has a high level of expression in mouse kidney and lower levels of expression in liver, lung, and brain. This mRNA is estimated to be 2.0 kb in size. Based on this result we set forth to clone the full-length cDNA for this EST from appropriate tissues to determine whether it did indeed represent a novel PDE. Several strategies for cloning the full-length cDNA of this EST were used, including hybridization screening of λ phage library, PCR screening of plasmid cDNA library, 5′ RACE, and EST data base walking, which involves using additional sequence information to screen EST data bases for longer EST clones overlapping the original truncated clones (Fig. 1). DNA probes were prepared from the 404030 EST insert fragment and used to screen roughly 700,000 mouse kidney λgT10 plaques. The resulting plaque pure clones were PCR amplified from λ phage and subcloned into PCR2.1 for sequencing. PCR analysis indicated clones 2.1 and 6.1 were both approximately 1 kb in size. Because the mRNA size by Northern blot analysis was 2 kb, this suggested that these clones were truncated. Sequencing of these clones demonstrated this to be the case. Clones 2.1 and 6.1 are identical and contain the sequence of EST clone 404030 to a polyadenine sequence. Simultaneous to the hybridization library screen we also designed primers complementary to the EST cDNA sequence to screen additional libraries by PCR for sequence 5′ to the EST sequence. This sequence was necessary for determining whether the EST actually encoded for a PDE because the catalytic domain sequence was predicted to lie 5′ to the sequence of 404030. Southern blot analysis of this PCR reaction demonstrated two bands that were specific to our EST sequence. Subsequent nested PCR reactions were done that resulted in a 1.6-kb cDNA that was subcloned into PCR2.1 TA vector for sequencing. This insert was sequenced and contained not only the sequence of EST clone 404030 but also the sequence that appeared to encode for a PDE catalytic domain containing the PDEase signature motif of HDX 2HX 4N (9Beavo J.A. Reifsnyder D.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 150-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Additionally this PDE appeared to belong to a novel family of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases in that the predicted conserved domain shared less than 50% sequence identity with the conserved domains of members of the other seven known families (Fig. 3). The combined sequence from the screen of the mouse kidney library and the PCR screen of the rat brain library resulted in a cDNA that still appeared to be truncated at the 5′ end because no start site with a Kozak consensus (10Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar) was present. Walking the EST data base was done by using the additional rat brain cDNA sequence as a query to screen the data base using BlastN to find additional EST clones that contained the new 5′ end sequence and may also contain an additional sequence not cloned from the PCR screen of the rat brain cDNA library. This EST walking resulted in the isolation of mouse embryo EST clone identification number 420451, which contained an additional 18 bases 5′ to the rat brain cDNA sequence. These additional 18 bases contained an in-frame start methionine with a very strong Kozak consensus sequence (10Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar). This clone also contains the sequence of EST clone 404030 and is truncated at the 3′ end internalNotI site consistent with the use of NotI in the generation of this library. 5′ RACE of mouse kidney and day 17 embryo cDNA was also done, and sequencing of these cDNAs cloned into PCR2.1 yielded no additional sequence but confirmed the 5′ end of our resulting cDNA. The subsequent cDNA compiled from the overlapping EST clone 420451 and clones 2.1 and 6.1 of the mouse kidney library screen generate a sequence that is 1929 base pairs in length. PCR of mouse kidney cDNA using primers Krace.S1 and PDE.stp.AS1 and sequencing of this clone demonstrates that the resultant overlapping cDNA clone presented here exists as a single mRNA species (Fig. 1). It appears unlikely that this cDNA is not full-length because no additional 5′ sequence was found in either the EST data base or by 5′ RACE of both mouse kidney and mouse embryonic cDNA. Furthermore, the cDNA size is in good agreement with the corresponding 2.0-kb mRNA size observed by Northern blotting, and the start methionine follows the rule of Kozak (10Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar). A human isoform of this family (HSPDE9A2), which shares 93% sequence identity to MMPDE9A1, has been recently identified (11Fisher D.A. Smith J.F. Pillar J.S. St. Denis S.H. Cheng J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 15559-15564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This clone contains a putative start methionine identical to the putative start methionine found in MMPDE9A1, and the predicted amino acid sequence above this start methionine is not conserved between these two isoforms, arguing that this region is untranslated. No additional methionines or in-frame stop codons have been found upstream of the putative start methionine in either the mouse or human cDNAs. Because the cDNA is slightly smaller than the mRNA and because no in-frame stop codons have been found, until either the amino acid sequence of the endogenous PDE9 or an in-frame stop codon in the putative 5′-untranslated region is discovered, the assignment of the start methionine presented here will remain tentative despite the above evidence, indicating this sequence is likely to be full-length. Although the mouse and human PDEs are certainly of the same family, with identical kinetics and inhibitor profiles, they are different in that MMPDE9A1 does not contain an insertion of 60 amino acids found within the region N-terminal to the conserved catalytic domain of HSPDE9A2. These two PDEs may represent distinct splice variants of the same family, or this variance may be attributable to a species difference. The fact that PDE9 is conserved from mouse to humans argues that this PDE family is functionally significant to these organisms. The predicted protein sequence of MMPDE9A1 is 534 amino acids in length with a predicted molecular mass of 62 kDa. (Fig. 4 A) This start methionine and the resultant open reading frame is functional when expressed in COS-7 cells (see below). All mammalian PDEs characterized to date contain a conserved region of approximately 250 amino acid residues representing the catalytic domain of each of these enzymes (12Charbonneau H. Beier N. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Many residues within this region are either absolutely or chemically preserved across species, from yeast to humans, and between PDE families. PDE9 is interesting in that three of these very highly conserved amino acids are divergent and all three cluster to the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain. The divergent amino acids identified here in mouse PDE9 are conserved in human PDE9 (11Fisher D.A. Smith J.F. Pillar J.S. St. Denis S.H. Cheng J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 15559-15564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (315) Google Scholar) also. Fig. 4 B is an alignment of the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain from representatives of each of the eight families of PDEs. The first divergent substitution (1, Fig. 4 B) is a conservative switch from a phenylalanine that is absolutely preserved among all other known PDEs to a tyrosine at this position in PDE9. Variation two (2, Fig. 4 B) is less conserved. This alteration results in the replacement of a wholly conserved glycine found in all other mammalian PDEs to a serine at this position in PDE9. The third deviation found within PDE9 is a divergence from the chemically conserved hydrophobic residues isoleucine, leucine, and valine to the dissimilar and positively charged residue lysine. Although the exact function of these residues has not been determined to date, it is anticipated that some of these deviations from the highly conserved amino acids may participate in defining the unique kinetic characteristics of PDE9 (see kinetic and inhibitory studies). Ultimately, crystal structure solutions of several PDE catalytic domains will be needed to determine what functional roles these residues may play. To demonstrate functional activity for PDE9 and to further characterize this novel PDE, we subcloned a cDNA constructed from overlapping clones for PDE9 and containing the full open reading frame reported here into the vector PCR3.1 for expression in mammalian cells. This construct was transfected into COS-7 cells, and PDE activity was assayed after 48–72 h. A low K m cGMP PDE activity that was significantly higher (6–18-fold higher, depending on transfection batch) in PDE9-transfected cells compared with PCDNA-3 alone-transfected cells was detected. This PDE9 activity does not appear to hydrolyze cAMP, and cGMP activity is not appreciably effected by cAMP, up to 100 μm (data not shown). This indicates that PDE9 is very specific for the hydrolysis of cGMP alone. Kinetic assays were done in triplicate on two different batches of COS-7 cell homogenates transfected with PDE9. Endogenous cGMP hydrolysis from vector only-transfected cells were subtracted from corresponding assays of PDE9-transfected cells. These assays demonstrate that this PDE has aK m of 0.07 μm ± 0.03 (average of five separate assays) (Fig. 5). This is the lowest K m for cGMP observed for a phosphodiesterase to date. Because PDE9 is specific for the hydrolysis of cGMP, it is of interest to compare this PDE with other cGMP specific PDEs. Although a previous report (13Burns F. Stevens P.A. Pyne N.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) has speculated on the existence of novel cGMP phosphodiesterases based on kinetic and inhibitor profiles of a partially purified activity, this activity is not likely to represent PDE9 because there is at least a 600-fold difference inK m for substrate between these PDEs. Additionally this partially purified PDE is inhibited by IBMX with an IC50 of 10 μm, whereas the IC50of PDE9 for IBMX is greater than 200 μm (TableI). Only two other known mammalian PDEs are specific for the hydrolysis of cGMP, PDE5 and PDE6. PDE6, also known as the retinal PDE, is tightly regulated by the binding of an inhibitory γ subunit. γ-mediated inhibition of PDE activity is relieved by activated transducin in response to light. PDE activation is also thought to be regulated by the binding of cGMP at noncatalytic sites, although this mode of regulation of PDE6 is not well understood (14Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y.

Chem. 1988; 263: 8133-8141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), approximately 170 times higher than that of PDE9. PDE5 is also cGMP-specific and binds cGMP at a noncatalytic cGMP-binding site. Binding of cGMP at this noncatalytic site is expected to confer some type of regulatory effects on PDE activity, although no direct effect has been demonstrated to date (1Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). This PDE has a K mof 4 μm (19Francis S.H. Lincoln T.M. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 620-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is at least 40 times higher than that of PDE9. PDE9 is the first cGMP-specific PDE to be identified that does not contain a region homologous to that of the noncatalytic cGMP-binding sites conserved between both PDE5 and PDE6 (20Charbonneau H. Prusti R.K. LeTrong H. Sonnenburg W.K. Mullaney P.J. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EHNA, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine. Inhibitor studies were performed on COS-7 cell homogenates expressing PDE9 activity. PDE9 activity varied between transfections from 6- to 18-fold higher than COS-7 cGMP PDE endogenous activity. Any background endogenous cGMP PDE activity was subtracted, and inhibitor vehicle effects were likewise subtracted from the effects of inhibitor. These assays were done in triplicate on two separate transfection batches. No unlabeled cGMP was added to these reactions so that the final substrate concentrations were determined only by the addition of tracer [3H]cGMP to the reaction (11.3 nm). At these concentrations the IC50should approach the K i. Although PDE9 demonstrates cGMP-specific PDE activity, this PDE is not inhibited well by most of the PDE inhibitors, including the nonspecific inhibitor IBMX (IC50 greater than 200 μm) (Table I). It is important to note that this PDE is also not inhibited by the PDE5-specific inhibitor sildenafil (21Boolell M. Allen M.J. Ballard S.A. Gepi A.S. Muirhead G.J. Naylor A.M. Osterloh I.H. Gingell C. Int. J. Impot. Res. 1996; 8: 47-52PubMed Google Scholar) nor the PDE5 and PDE6 inhibitor dipyridamole at doses within ranges considered specific. Zaprinast, another PDE5 and PDE6 inhibitor, will inhibit PDE9 at moderately high concentrations (29 μm). Interestingly, although PDE9 is not inhibited well by IBMX or the PDE5 or PDE6 inhibitors, it is inhibited by the relatively new PDE 1 and PDE5 inhibitor SCH 51866 with an IC50 of 1.55 μm. This is only 15 times higher than the IC50 of SCH 51866 for both PDE1 and PDE5, both of which have an IC50 of approximately 0.1 μm (22Vemulapalli S. Watkins R.W. Chintala M. Davis H. Ahn H.S. Fawzi A. Tulshian D. Chiu P. Chatterjee M. Lin C.C. Sybertz E.J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 28: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Few studies examining the biologic effects of SCH 51866 have been done to date; however, one such study has found this drug to have antiplatelet, antiproliferative, and hemodynamic effects (22Vemulapalli S. Watkins R.W. Chintala M. Davis H. Ahn H.S. Fawzi A. Tulshian D. Chiu P. Chatterjee M. Lin C.C. Sybertz E.J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 28: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, SCH 51866 inhibited platelet aggregation with an IC50 of 10 μm. Additionally, this compound also inhibited platelet adhesion, and platelet accumulation of cGMP was noted at these inhibitor concentrations. In balloon angioplasty injury of rat carotid arteries, SCH 51866 inhibited neointima formation. Furthermore, SCH 51866 dose-dependently reduced blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. It is possible that some of these results may be attributable to inhibition of PDE9 in addition to inhibition of either PDE1 or 5. Inhibition of PDE9 by SCH 51866 may also point to possible starting compounds for future studies assaying for more selective and potent inhibitors of PDE9. SCH 51866 may be useful in future studies of PDE9 function in tissues or cells that have low or no endogenous PDE1 or PDE5 phosphodiesterase activity. A search of GenBank™ using PDE9 sequence as a query indicates this PDE is slightly more homologous to a recently cloned D. discoideum PDE, RegA (3Shaulsky G. Escalante R. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15260-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), than to any of the known mammalian PDEs. Alignment of the conserved domain of RegA to that of PDE9 shows that 41% amino acid sequence identity exists between these two PDEs, which although higher than that for any of the mammalian PDEs (Fig. 3) is still low enough that these two PDEs cannot be considered to be in the same gene family. The significance of this higher degree of homology to RegA is unknown at this time; however, it appears that these two enzymes may not be functionally related because they do not share the same substrate specificity (23Loomis W.F. Shaulsky G. Wang N. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also do not share extended structural homology outside of the conserved domain. Previous work has noted that the N-terminal sequence of RegA is highly homologous to that of response regulator enzymes found in bacteria and lower eukaryotes, suggesting that this PDE may play a role in two-component signaling, possibly catalyzing histidine phosphotransfer to an aspartic acid to regulate PDE activity (3Shaulsky G. Escalante R. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15260-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that histidine phosphorylation has only been described in mammalian cells in a few cases (24Crovello C.S. Furie B.C. Furie B. Cell. 1995; 82: 279-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Motojima K. Goto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9030-9037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and histidine phosphotransfer has only recently been documented to occur with Nm23 proteins (26Freije J.M. Blay P. MacDonald N.J. Manrow R.E. Steeg P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5525-5532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21758-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The N terminus of PDE9 does not appear to share significant homology to Nm23 proteins and does not share homology to the region of RegA that is homologous to bacterial response regulators. The slightly higher degree of similarity these PDEs share may simply indicate that PDE9 evolved early in mammals and that RegA and PDE9 are closer in evolutionary distance to each other than more recently evolved mammalian PDEs. It is of interest to observe that of the three amino acid residues divergent within the conserved region of PDE9, two of these substitutions are also found in RegA (1 and 3, Fig. 4 B), lending credence to the idea that these two PDEs are more closely related to each other than to any of the other mammalian PDEs. Additional functional characterization of both RegA and PDE9 will be necessary to determine whether this sequence homology extends to some unknown functional homology. Although at this time it is unknown what physiologic roles PDE9 may regulate, the identification and initial description of this new family will aid in defining these roles in future studies. Because PDE9 is dedicated to the high affinity specific hydrolysis of cGMP, PDE9 must be involved in the regulation of signal transduction pathways that concern activation of guanylyl cyclase activity. For example, ANP receptors expressed in kidney regulate diuresis by ligand-activated receptor guanylyl cyclase activity (28Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Chin H.M. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 29Waldman S.A. Rapoport R.M. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14332-14334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tremblay J. Gerzer R. Vinay P. Pang S.C. Béliveau R. Hamet P. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because PDE9 is most highly expressed at the mRNA level in kidney, it is tempting to speculate that this novel PDE may participate in regulating this pathway by maintaining basal cGMP levels at low concentrations, by enlarging the ANP cGMP signal, and/or by lowering intracellular cGMP levels after ANP receptor activation, thus terminating ANP-mediated diuresis. Indeed, previous studies have shown that inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis by infusion of zaprinast (which at higher concentrations will inhibit PDE9; Table I) potentiates the effect of ANP on natriuresis without causing deleterious drops in blood pressure (31Wilkins M.R. Settle S.L. Needleman P. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Wilkins M.R. Settle S.L. Stockmann P.T. Needleman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because ANP receptors are known to be localized within the glomerulus and inner medullary collecting ducts (33Zeidel M.L. Silva P. Brenner B.M. Seifter J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: F551-F559PubMed Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine the cellular localization of PDE9 enzyme in kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1994463345,"A novel manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) isozyme produced in manganese-free cultures of Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS55 was purified and characterized. The production of the enzyme was greatly stimulated by the exogenous addition of various physiological organic acids such as glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate. The physical properties of the enzyme are similar to those of MnP isozymes from different white rot fungi (Mr = 43,000, pI 3.88, and epsilon407 nm = 123 mM-1 cm-1). The Bjerkandera MnP was efficient in the oxidation of Mn(II), as indicated by the kinetic constants (low Km of 51 microM and turnover number of 59 s-1). Furthermore, the isozyme was able to oxidize various substrates in the absence of manganese, such as 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, guaiacol, ABTS, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and o- and p-anisidine. An interesting characteristic of the isozyme was its ability to oxidize nonphenolic substrates, veratryl alcohol and 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, without manganese addition. The affinity for veratryl alcohol (Km = 116 microM) and its turnover number (2.8 s-1) are comparable to those of lignin peroxidase (LiP) isozymes from other white rot fungi. Manganese at concentrations greater than 0.1 mM severely inhibited the oxidation of veratryl alcohol. The results suggest that this single isozyme is a hybrid between MnP and LiP found in other white rot fungi. The N-terminal amino acid sequence showed a very high homology to those of both MnP and LiP isozymes from Trametes versicolor."
https://openalex.org/W2044935554,"LAR family transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatases function in axon guidance and mammary gland development. In cultured cells, LAR binds to the intracellular, coiled coil LAR-interacting protein at discrete ends of focal adhesions, implicating these proteins in the regulation of cell-matrix interactions. We describe seven LAR-interacting protein-like genes in humans and Caenorhabditis elegans that form the liprin gene family. Based on sequence similarities and binding characteristics, liprins are subdivided into alpha-type and beta-type liprins. The C-terminal, non-coiled coil regions of alpha-liprins bind to the membrane-distal phosphatase domains of LAR family members, as well as to the C-terminal, non-coiled coil region of beta-liprins. Both alpha- and beta-liprins homodimerize via their N-terminal, coiled coil regions. Liprins are thus multivalent proteins that potentially form complex structures. Some liprins have broad mRNA tissue distributions, whereas others are predominately expressed in the brain. Co-expression studies indicate that liprin-alpha2 alters LAR cellular localization and induces LAR clustering. We propose that liprins function to localize LAR family tyrosine phosphatases at specific sites on the plasma membrane, possibly regulating their interaction with the extracellular environment and their association with substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1991261634,"Interleukin-8, a member of the CXC chemokine family, has been shown to bind to glycosaminoglycans. It has been suggested that heparan sulfate on cell surfaces could provide specific ligand sites on endothelial cells to retain the highly diffusible inflammatory chemokine for presentation to leukocytes. By using selectively modified heparin and heparan sulfate fragments in a nitrocellulose filter trapping system, we have analyzed sequence requirements for interleukin-8 binding to heparin/heparan sulfate. We demonstrate that the affinity of a monomeric interleukin-8 molecule for heparin/heparan sulfate is too weak to allow binding at physiological ionic strength, whereas the dimeric form of the protein mediates binding to two sulfated domains of heparan sulfate. These domains, each an N-sulfated block of ∼6 monosaccharide units, are contained within an ∼22–24-mer sequence and are separated by a region of ≤14 monosaccharide residues that may be fullyN-acetylated. Binding to interleukin-8 correlates with the occurrence of the di-O-sulfated disaccharide unit -IdceA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-.

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), 1The abbreviations used are: GAGs, glycosaminoglycans; HS, heparan sulfate; IL-8, interleukin-8; aManR, 2,5-anhydromannitol. 1The abbreviations used are: GAGs, glycosaminoglycans; HS, heparan sulfate; IL-8, interleukin-8; aManR, 2,5-anhydromannitol. i.e. the linear, sulfate-substituted carbohydrate constituents of proteoglycans, are ubiquitous components of cell surfaces. They are generally believed to exert their biological functions by interacting with proteins. Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) are sulfated GAGs of alternating hexuronic acid and glucosamine residues that have been shown to bind a variety of enzymes, cytokines/growth factors, and extracellular matrix molecules (for review, see Ref. 1Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellén L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Such interactions may be highly specific, as illustrated by heparin/HS and antithrombin. A defined pentasaccharide sequence in the GAG chain binds antithrombin and thus strongly promotes its function as an inhibitor of the serine proteases acting within the coagulation cascade (2Bourin M.C. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Other proteins, such as histones, bind GAGs due to their overall basic character, without any apparent need for a specific saccharide sequence. Several attempts have been made to identify minimal consensus sequences in proteins required to bind heparin or HS (3Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clusters of basic amino acid residues may provide binding sites that are either located within a short linear peptide stretch or composed of residues that occur topologically close together, but on different peptide loops (for review, see Ref. 5Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 677-682Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Sulfate groups on the GAG chains have been identified as important determinants of protein-binding sites. They are introduced during the process of polymer modification, through which the initial (GlcUAβ1,4-GlcNAcα1,4)n polysaccharide chain is transformed into the final product (6Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). While each reaction, catalyzed by a distinct enzyme, generates the substrate for subsequent reactions, these are generally incomplete, which leads to progressive structural heterogeneity. Due to modulated activity of the GlcNAcN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, i.e.the enzyme that initiates polymer modification in HS and heparin biosynthesis, variable proportions of GlcNAc units escapeN-deacetylation/N-sulfation. These residualN-acetylated units are few and isolated in heparin and are more abundant and typically arranged in consecutive sequence in HS. TheN-sulfate groups are prerequisite to substrate recognition by the GlcUA 5-epimerase and the O-sulfotransferases that catalyze the subsequent modification reactions. Consequently, heparin shows a high proportion of IdceA-containing, O-sulfated disaccharide units and a relatively homogeneous overall sulfation pattern, whereas HS is composed of alternating sulfated and nonsulfated sequences of variable length (7Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A typical HS chain will thus contain essentially unmodified regions of up to 8–10 consecutive GlcUA-GlcNAc disaccharide units. Clearly, the occurrence of such regions will profoundly influence the mode of interaction with proteins. Multidomain interaction between HS and proteins has so far received little attention. Such interaction would apply in particular to oligomeric proteins composed of monomers carrying single “heparin-binding sites.” To study such a system, we have chosen the heparin-binding cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is a proinflammatory cytokine of the CXC chemokine family that forms noncovalently linked dimers with a characteristic appearance (9Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). Crystallographic and NMR studies have provided insights into the shape of the molecule, which consists of a flat array of a β-pleated sheet with the α-helices of the two monomers arranged as antiparallel rods on top of this sheet (10Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 11Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol.

Wlodawer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The heparin-binding sites have been tentatively localized to the exposed positively charged residues on the top of these helices (13Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Webb L.M. Ehrengruber M.U. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Rot A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7158-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The results of this study define constraints critical to the interaction of a HS chain with the IL-8 dimer. A minimal sequence of 18–20 monosaccharide units is required to span the two saccharide-binding sites on the dimer. The corresponding peptide-binding regions may be separated by a nonsulfated intervening stretch composed of up to 7 GlcUA-GlcNAc disaccharide units. Recombinant human IL-8 was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (15Daly T.J. LaRosa G.J. Dolich S. Maione T.E. Cooper S. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23282-23292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except that a final step of affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose was added. Twenty mg of lyophilized IL-8 were dissolved in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and passed over a 2-ml column of heparin-agarose (Sigma, type I) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was developed with a linear salt gradient ranging from 0.15 to 2m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.2. The protein eluted as a single major peak at around 0.6 m NaCl. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against four changes of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized. Bovine lung heparin (The Upjohn Co.) was purified as described (16Lindahl U. Cifonelli J.A.

Heparinase fromFlavobacterium heparinum (EC 4.2.2.7), which is specific for IdceA(2-OSO3), was obtained from Sigma, and heparitinase from F. heparinum (heparitin-sulfate lyase, EC 4.2.2.8; a mixture of heparitinases I and II according to the information by the supplier), specific for N-acetylated sequences, was purchased from Seikagaku Corp. Bio-Gel P-10 (superfine) was from Bio-Rad.

A Partisil-10 SAX anion-exchange column (4.6 × 250 mm) and Whatman No. 3MM filter paper were purchased from Whatman Ltd. (Maidstone, Kent, Great Britain). NaB3H4 (24–28 Ci/mmol) and [3H]acetic anhydride (500 mCi/mmol) were obtained from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Hydrazine hydrate was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). All other reagents were the best grade available. Heparin wasN-3H-acetylated at free amino groups as described (18Höök M.

Bovine kidney HS (0.5 mg) was partiallyN-deacetylated by hydrazinolysis for 30 min at 96 °C in 1 ml of hydrazine hydrate (∼30% water) and 1% hydrazine sulfate (19Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal.

A specific activity of ∼0.4 × 106 dpm/μg of uronic acid was achieved (corresponding to an average of ∼4.6 × 106 dpm/nmol of HS based on an estimated molecular mass of 11.5 kDa for the HS chains labeled).

Open table in a new tab Limited deaminative cleavage of native and modified heparin was performed as follows to create size-defined fragments. To cleave chains atN-sulfated glucosamine units, 10 mg of native or 2-O-desulfated heparin (which still contains most of theN-sulfates) were dissolved in water adjusted to pH 1.5 with H2SO4 (final volume, 1 ml). Following the addition of NaNO2 (140 μg in 10 μl), the solutions were kept on ice for 3 h. The reaction was stopped by adjusting the pH to 9 with Na2CO3, and the cleavage products were reduced with 2.5 mCi of NaB3H4 overnight at room temperature, followed by 10 mg of unlabeled NaBH4for 2 h. The resultant labeled oligosaccharides were desalted on a column (1.2 × 66 cm) of Sephadex G-15 in 0.2 mNH4HCO3 and separated by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 146 cm) of Bio-Gel P-10 in 0.5 mNH4HCO3. Preferentially 6-O-desulfated heparin was cleaved at some of theN-unsubstituted amino groups of glucosamine residues that had been created by the preceding desulfation step. A 10-mg sample was dissolved in water, and the solution was adjusted to pH 4.0 with CH3COOH and rendered 0.1 m in NaNO2(final volume, 1 ml). The sample was incubated on ice for 30 min. The reaction was terminated, and the sample was 3H-labeled as described above. All O-desulfated heparin fragments were re-N-sulfated as described (21Feyzi E. Trybala E. Bergström T. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24850-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) before final separation by gel chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10. The specific activities of the3H-labeled modified heparin fragments ranged between 0.25 and 0.5 × 106 dpm/nmol of oligosaccharide. Size-defined HS fragments were produced enzymatically. Ten μg ofN-3H-acetylated bovine kidney HS (specific activity, 0.4 × 106 dpm/μg of uronic acid, ∼4.6 × 106 dpm/nmol of HS) were digested with 0.04 units of heparinase in 200 μl of 5 mm sodium Pi, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. The digest was separated on a Bio-Gel P-10 column as described for the heparin fragments. HS fragments of approximate 20–24-mer size (by reference to heparin oligosaccharide standards) were isolated and used in binding experiments with IL-8. In a protection approach, the N-3H-acetylated HS (∼1 μg) was incubated with 0.1–1.0 milliunit of heparitinase (a mixture of heparitinases I and II specific for N-acetylated glucosamine units) in the presence or absence of 10 μg of IL-8 in 200 μl of 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, and 1 mm CaCl2. Digestion was maintained for 60 min at 43 °C and was then stopped by heating at 96 °C for 5 min. The digests were separated on a Superose 12 column in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, and 1 m NaCl, and effluent fractions were analyzed by scintillation counting and pooled as indicated. Radiolabeled GAGs or size-defined fragments were incubated with protein in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing different amounts of salt (see figure legends) as described (22Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Protein along with any bound oligosaccharides was trapped on a nitrocellulose filter (25-mm diameter unless otherwise stated). The filter was washed with the incubation buffer, protein-bound oligosaccharides were dissociated from the membrane in 2m NaCl, and the radioactivity was measured or the sample was desalted for further analysis. In preparative experiments, 1 nmol each of the indicated 3H-labeled modified heparin 18-mers was incubated with 10 nmol of protein in a final volume of 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The bound fractions were isolated by filter absorption over two 45-mm filters and recovered as described above. The amounts of bound material were calculated based on recovered3H and the specific radioactivity of the respective preparations. GAGs were quantified by colorimetric determination of hexuronic acid using themeta-hydroxydiphenyl method (23Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (5783) Google Scholar) with GlcUA as a standard. A factor of 3 was arbitrarily employed to convert values to saccharide mass. To ensure complete N-substitution following chemicalN-sulfation, saccharide samples were tested forN-unsubstituted glucosamine residues by treatment with nitrous acid at pH 4 (24Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), followed by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 150 cm) of Sephadex G-50 in 1 m NaCl. Size separation of selectively desulfated heparin preparations on a Superose 6 column gave an average molecular mass for all preparations of 10–11 kDa. Thus, no appreciable cleavage had occurred during chemical processing. The composition of native or modified heparin chains or oligosaccharides was determined after complete deamination at pH 1.5 for N-sulfated chains or at pH 4 following hydrazinolysis ofN-acetylated chains (4 h at 96 °C) (25Pejler G. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Paulsson M. Dziadek M. Fujiwara S. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant disaccharides were reduced with NaB3H4, recovered by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-15 (1 × 200 cm), and separated by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography on a Partisil-10 SAX column. The proportions of nonsulfated disaccharides were determined by high-voltage paper electrophoresis on Whatman No. 3MM paper in pyridine acetate buffer, pH 5.3. The smallest oligosaccharide fragment able to bind to IL-8 was identified by in-solution binding studies using radiolabeled size-defined heparin fragments. Under physiological buffer conditions, the smallest fragment with appreciable affinity for IL-8 was a heparin 18-mer (Fig. 1 A). The interaction between heparin and IL-8 was previously shown to be of relatively low affinity, with a K d of ∼6 × 10−6m (26Witt D.P. Lander A.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and we therefore considered the possibility of a charge-dependent interaction involving a shorter saccharide sequence that had escaped detection due to the ionic conditions of the assay. Indeed, washing of the nitrocellulose filter at lower ionic strength (10 mm phosphate buffer without added NaCl) revealed a remarkably distinct binding profile with a heparin 8-mer as the smallest binding species (Fig. 1 A). In accord with this finding, small heparin oligosaccharides were able to compete with full-sized radiolabeled heparin for binding to IL-8 at physiological ionic strength. The smallest oligosaccharide that inhibited the binding of labeled heparin for 50% or more was a 6-mer (Fig. 1 B). The importance of different sulfate groups in the binding of heparin-related saccharides to IL-8 was evaluated using a competition assay with variably modified heparin chains. Full-length radiolabeled heparin was allowed to interact with IL-8 in the presence of unlabeled native or selectively modified heparin (Fig. 2 and Table I). Native bovine lung heparin showed the highest inhibitor capacity, above that of any of the modified heparins. A drop in competition effectiveness by a factor of ∼10 was seen with two of the selectively monodesulfated species,i.e. the selectively N-desulfated and the 2-O-desulfated preparations, whereas the preferentially 6-O-desulfated preparation was slightly less efficient (it should be noted that chemical 6-O-desulfation is accompanied by partial 2-O-desulfation). The more completely 2,6-O-desulfated sample was a hundredfold less efficient than native heparin. The remaining preparations, i.e. theN-/2-O-, N-/6-O-, and completely N-/2-O-/6-O-desulfated samples, were all ineffective as competitors. These results indicate that N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfate groups all contribute appreciably to IL-8 binding. To further define the role ofO-sulfate groups, 3H-labeled 18-mers derived from selectively O-desulfated heparins (see “Materials”) were affinity-fractionated, and the disaccharide composition of IL-8-bound fractions was compared with that of the corresponding unfractionated material. Application of a preferentially 6-O-desulfated 18-mer to this procedure resulted in retention of 6% of the material on the nitrocellulose filter, complexed with IL-8, whereas the 2-O-desulfated fraction yielded 15% of IL-8-bound material. These bound fragments were dissociated from nitrocellulose-adsorbed protein by sodium chloride and desalted. In analytical assays, aliquots of the bound fractions were compared with the respective unfractionated starting material for binding to IL-8. Both preparations, independent of the type of modification, showed increased binding to IL-8 as compared with the unfractionated starting material. Under similar interaction conditions, 1.8 pmol of unmodified heparin, 0.8 pmol of 2-O-desulfated, and 0.3 pmol of 6-O-desulfated heparin were bound to IL-8. From the recovered, once IL-8-bound pools, 1.4 pmol of the selectively 2-O-desulfated and 0.9 pmol of the corresponding, preferentially 6-O-desulfated preparations were sequestered on the filter in a second binding experiment. The preselected 2-O-desulfated sample thus approached the binding ability of unmodified heparin. Compositional analysis of the IL-8-bound fractions showed only marginal differences in the overall degree of sulfation and distribution ofO-sulfate groups compared with the corresponding unfractionated materials (Fig. 3 and Table II). The bound material derived from a 2-O-desulfated 18-mer was thus abundantly 6-O-sulfated, but low in 2-O-sulfate groups, whereas that recovered from a 6-O-desulfated 18-mer showed the reverse proportions. However, both fractions yielded significantly increased amounts of the minor 2,6-di-O-sulfated disaccharide representing -IdceA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)- structures in the intact polysaccharide; this increase was particularly conspicuous for the 6-O-desulfated material. The amounts of the di-O-sulfated disaccharide unit approached 1 mol/mol of either type of IL-8-bound 18-mer (i.e. 11% of the total disaccharide units), and it therefore seems reasonable to conclude that this structure is of importance to the interaction between IL-8 and heparin or HS. While most of the additional 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups, located on mono-O-sulfated disaccharide units, are most likely redundant for IL-8 binding, we cannot exclude that selected residues contribute to the interaction.Table IIDisaccharide composition of affinity-selected modified heparin fragmentsPreparationDisaccharide compositionaThe heparin-derived 18-mers were3H-end-labeled.

Open table in a new tab The interaction studies using native or modified heparin oligomers demonstrated that the IL-8 dimer may be spanned by exclusivelyN-sulfated, extended saccharide sequences. However, since the physiological GAG ligand for IL-8 at the cell surface is presumably HS rather than heparin, we proceeded to study HS-derived IL-8-binding oligosaccharides, with the explicit aim of assessing to what extent such species may contain N-acetylated domains.N-[3H]Acetyl-labeled kidney HS was first degraded by limited digestion with heparinase to cleave glucosaminidic linkages between GlcNSO3(±6-OSO3) and IdceA(2-OSO3) units, thus generating HS oligomers with internal (labeled) N-acetylated sequences flanked on both sides by N-sulfated, presumably IL-8-binding regions (Fig. 4 A). After size separation, a fraction corresponding to a heparin ∼20–24-mer was selected for binding to IL-8 using the nitrocellulose trapping system. Following incubation with the protein, the bound (∼10% of added 3H under conditions of low-salt wash) and unbound fractions were recovered and treated exhaustively with nitrous acid at pH 1.5. The resulting labeled, exclusively N-3H-acetylated fragments were separated by gel chromatography (Fig. 5). The IL-8-unbound fraction yielded a spectrum of variously sized oligomers, with a predominant component larger than a heparin 12-mer or a K5 16-mer (see legend to Fig. 5). This component was largely lacking in the deamination products from the IL-8-bound fraction. Instead, these products showed a larger proportion of smaller labeled oligosaccharides, which ranged in size from heparin 4- to 12-mers. This result indicates that an IL-8-binding region in a HS chain may contain up to 6–7 contiguous N-acetylated disaccharide units, which separate two smallerN-sulfated binding sites, each composed of 4–6 monosaccharide units. Judging from the distribution of smallerN-[3H]acetyl-labeled oligosaccharides,N-sulfate groups may occur also in the intervening sequence bridging the two terminal sulfated regions (in accord with the results of experiments involving labeled heparin oligomers).Figure 5Binding of [3H]HS fragments to IL-8. N-3H-Acetylated HS was cleaved by heparinase digestion, and a fraction corresponding to an ∼20–24-mer heparin standard was applied to IL-8 binding. A sample of 0.1 × 106 dpm was incubated with 10 nmol of IL-8 under standard conditions, and bound (∼10%) and unbound fractions were recovered following nitrocellulose filter trapping. Both fractions were then desalted and subjected to exhaustive deamination at pH 1.5. The products derived from IL-8-bound (•) and -unbound (○) preparations were separated on Superdex 30 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The elution positions of standard, size-defined,3H-labeled oligosaccharides derived from heparin and fromE. coli K5 polysaccharides are indicated byarrows and open arrows, respectively. Heparin fragments are highly sulfated, whereas the bacterial saccharides are nonsulfated. HS chains contain only a few sulfate groups within the nitrous acid-resistant N-acetylated domains and therefore presumably elute more closely to the K5 standards.View Large Image Figure"

We established a new method to purify soluble HCV NS5B in the glutathione S-transferase-fused form NS5Bt from Escherichia coli which lacks the C-terminal 21 amino acid residues encompassing a putative anchoring domain (anino acids 2990-3010). The recombinant soluble protein exhibited RdRP activity in vitro which was dependent upon the template and primer, but it did not exhibit the terminal transferase activity that has been reported to be associated with the recombinant NS5B protein from insect cells. The RdRP activity of purified glutathione S-transferase-NS5Bt and thrombin-cleavaged non-fused NS5Bt shares most of the properties. Substitution mutations of NS5Bt at the GDD motif, which is highly conserved among viral RdRPs, and at the clustered basic residues (amino acids 2919-2924 and 2693-2699) abolished the RdRP activity. The C-terminal region of NS5B, which is dispensable for the RdRP activity, dramatically affected the subcellular localization of NS5B retaining it in perinuclear sites in transiently overexpressed mammalian cells. These results may provide some clues to dissecting the molecular mechanism of the HCV replication and also act as a basis for developing new anti-viral drugs."

In the present study, we have determined the contribution of various amino acids to inhibitor binding and find that three amino acids within the ATP pocket play a major role in determining the selectivity of p38 and p38β for SB 203580. Substitution of these three residues for the corresponding amino acids in SAPK3, SAPK4, or JNK1 is sufficient to confer sensitivity to SB 203580.DISCUSSIONMutagenesis of the ATP pocket of p38 and its homologues has revealed distinctions between the residues required to bind pyridinyl imidazoles and those required for kinase activity. This is illustrated in Fig. 7; Panel A shows residues that result in loss of kinase activity together with a model of ATP bound in the ATP pocket of p38. Panel B highlights residues found to increase or decrease cross-linking to SB 206718; these are shown in the context of the x-ray co-crystal structure of SB 203580 bound to p382. The residues that affect kinase activity are consistent with what is known from related crystal structures. For example, Lys-53, Lys-152, and Asp-168 are known catalytic residues conserved in all serine-threonine protein kinases. Val-38, Ile-84, and Leu-171 are highly conserved nonpolar residues in the pocket. Comparison to the activated ERK2 structure suggests that Arg-67 may form an ion-pair interaction with the phosphorylated Thr-180 in the activation loop, which is critical for the domain rotation and closure which occurs upon MAPK activation (27Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ala-157, Asn-114, and Asn-115 are not conserved among kinases. The particularly strong effect of mutating Ala-157 to Leu (the equivalent residue in ERK) may be due to its effect on Met-109 packing, which is different in p38 than in ERK (27Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar).Among the residues involved in photoaffinity cross-linking to125I-SB 206718, several overlap with those required for kinase activity (Val-38, Lys-53, Arg-67, Ile-84, Lys-152, Ala-157, Leu-167, and Asp-168). As indicated above, many of these are highly conserved in all serine-threonine protein kinases (Lys-53, Lys-152, and Asp-168) or MAPK (Arg-67 and Ile-84). Those residues that affect only125I-SB 206718 cross-linking include Val-30, Tyr-35, and Thr-106. Although Tyr-35 is fairly well conserved, being either a Phe or Tyr in most protein kinases, Val-30 and Thr-106 are not conserved with other MAPKs. All of the mutations that affect cross-linking of125I-SB 206718 are also those that are in intimate contact with its analogue, SB 203580, in the co-crystal structure2with p38 (Fig. 7 B) (see also Refs. 21Tong L. Pav S. White D.M. Rogers W. Crane K.M. Cywin C.L. Brown M.L. Pargellis C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar and 22Wilson K.P. McCaffrey P.G. Hsiao K.

Biol. 1997; 4: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mutations alter binding of the cross-linking agent, not the chemical reaction at the cross-linking site itself, which is known to be close to residue Thr-175 (11Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The overall picture that emerges is that the inhibitors interact with a combination of both conserved and non-conserved residues, some of which are unique for binding of the inhibitors and some of which are also used for binding ATP.Further evaluation of effects of various mutations on the ability of SB 203580 to inhibit p38 kinase activity localized the critical region to three residues, Thr-106, His-107, and Leu-108, which lie at the back of the ATP pocket and form the hinge between the two domains flanking the active site. This region is also close to three of the less conserved amino acids important for binding (Val-30, Ala-157, and Leu-167) (Fig. 7 B). Although substitution of just Thr-106 with Met in p38 and vice versa in SAPK3, SAPK4, and JNK1 led to kinases with intermediate sensitivity to SB 203580 when these mutants were expressed in mammalian cells, all three residues (Thr-106, His-107, and Leu-108) were required for complete sensitivity. Thus, apparently, one or both of His-107 and Leu-108 are also important for inhibitor sensitivity. The idea that His-107 is also critical for sensitivity to the inhibitor (in addition to Thr-106) is supported by the data with JNK1 and its mutants, which indicate that both Thr-106 and His-107 must be present for complete sensitivity to SB 203580. Neither Leu-108 alone nor the combination of Leu-108 and Thr-106 are sufficient for complete sensitivity. This part of the p38 chain adopts a different conformation from ERK2 (27Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and so it is possible that mutations in more than one of the residues in this hinge region alter its conformation and orientation relative to the ATP pocket. The structure of the co-complex of SB 203580 with p38 shows that Thr-106 contacts the inhibitor and that the imidazole ring of His-107, which faces away from the ATP pocket, is involved in hydrogen bonding networks that change on inhibitor binding.2The role of Thr-106 has been alluded to previously (21Tong L. Pav S. White D.M. Rogers W. Crane K.M. Cywin C.L. Brown M.L. Pargellis C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 22Wilson K.P. McCaffrey P.G. Hsiao K.

Its small size allows the formation of a pocket into which the fluorophenyl ring of the pyridinyl imidazoles can fit. Substitution with Ala, another small amino acid, had no impact on inhibition by pyridinyl imidazoles (22Wilson K.P. McCaffrey P.G. Hsiao K. Pazhanisamy S. Galullo V. Bemis G.W. Fitzgibbon M.J. Caron P.R. Murcko M.A. Su M.S.S. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Indeed, we saw enhanced cross-linking of 125I-SB 206718 to this mutant p38. In contrast, substitution with a bulky residue such as Met resulted in reduced binding and inhibition consistent with its blocking access to the fluorophenyl pocket. However, our inhibition results do not agree quantitatively with the published work (22Wilson K.P. McCaffrey P.G. Hsiao K. Pazhanisamy S. Galullo V. Bemis G.W. Fitzgibbon M.J. Caron P.R. Murcko M.A. Su M.S.S. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), where substitution of Thr-106 by Met resulted in complete loss of inhibition by the related SB 202190 up to 30 μm; in our hands, it was still sensitive to inhibitor at 10 μm. This difference might result from the different source of p38, which in our hands was immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells, but in the previous work was expressed in Escherichia coli and activated in vitro with constitutively active MKK6. The idea that the expression system may influence the inhibition results is supported by kinase inhibition data we obtained with extracts from yeast expressing human p38, p38(106M), and p38(MPF), which revealed that, as in bacteria, the single mutation (p38(106M)) is sufficient to convert p38 to an SB 203580-insensitive phenotype at concentrations up to 10 μm. In contrast, mutation of all three residues (MPF) was required for an insensitive phenotype in the mammalian expression system. These differences may be due to additional proteins, which are associated with mammalian p38 immunoprecipitates and which may interact with His-107 or Leu-108 and alter the conformation of p38. The idea that the hinge region is involved in protein/protein interactions is further supported by the existence of dominant negative mutations near this locus in the yeast MAPK homologue FUS3 (2Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 28Brill J.A. Elion E.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 297-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated that alteration of three residues at the back of the ATP binding pocket to Thr-106, His-107, and Leu-108 of p38 is sufficient to confer sensitivity to SB 203580 to p38 homologues such as SAPK3 and SAPK4 and to more distantly related MAPKs such as JNK1. It will be of interest to determine whether introduction of these changes into non-MAPK protein kinases can confer sensitivity to the pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors. Through their altered sensitivity to SB 203580, the mutant p38, SAPK3, SAPK4, and JNK1 now provide tools for further dissecting in vivo pathways in which they have been implicated. In addition, understanding the manner in which pyridinyl imidazoles interact with p38 may now allow synthesis of compounds that specifically interact with other MAPKs but not p38.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). At least three families of MAPKs have been identified in mammalian cells (2Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). The first family, the extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs), is activated primarily by mitogenic stimuli, growth factors and tumor promoters (2Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). The other two families, the Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) (JNK1 is also known as stress-activated protein kinase 1 or SAPK1) and the p38 MAPKs (p38 is also known as CSBP2, RK, SAPK2 and, in yeast, HOG1) are activated primarily by environmental stress and inflammatory agents (3Derijard B.

All of these MAPKs are serine-threonine protein kinases, which are activated by different upstream MAPK kinases through phosphorylation of a Thr-Xaa-Tyr motif in an activation loop near the ATP and substrate binding sites (2Cobb M.H.

The length of the activation loop and the identity of the central (Xaa) amino acid (Glu for the ERKs, Pro for the JNKs, and Gly for p38 MAPKs) differ between the three MAPK families as do their in vivo substrate specificities (2Cobb M.H.

The overall picture that emerges is that the inhibitors interact with a combination of both conserved and non-conserved residues, some of which are unique for binding of the inhibitors and some of which are also used for binding ATP.Further evaluation of effects of various mutations on the ability of SB 203580 to inhibit p38 kinase activity localized the critical region to three residues, Thr-106, His-107, and Leu-108, which lie at the back of the ATP pocket and form the hinge between the two domains flanking the active site. This region is also close to three of the less conserved amino acids important for binding (Val-30, Ala-157, and Leu-167) (Fig. 7 B). Although substitution of just Thr-106 with Met in p38 and vice versa in SAPK3, SAPK4, and JNK1 led to kinases with intermediate sensitivity to SB 203580 when these mutants were expressed in mammalian cells, all three residues (Thr-106, His-107, and Leu-108) were required for complete sensitivity. Thus, apparently, one or both of His-107 and Leu-108 are also important for inhibitor sensitivity. The idea that His-107 is also critical for sensitivity to the inhibitor (in addition to Thr-106) is supported by the data with JNK1 and its mutants, which indicate that both Thr-106 and His-107 must be present for complete sensitivity to SB 203580. Neither Leu-108 alone nor the combination of Leu-108 and Thr-106 are sufficient for complete sensitivity. This part of the p38 chain adopts a different conformation from ERK2 (27Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and so it is possible that mutations in more than one of the residues in this hinge region alter its conformation and orientation relative to the ATP pocket. The structure of the co-complex of SB 203580 with p38 shows that Thr-106 contacts the inhibitor and that the imidazole ring of His-107, which faces away from the ATP pocket, is involved in hydrogen bonding networks that change on inhibitor binding.2The role of Thr-106 has been alluded to previously (21Tong L.

Its small size allows the formation of a pocket into which the fluorophenyl ring of the pyridinyl imidazoles can fit. Substitution with Ala, another small amino acid, had no impact on inhibition by pyridinyl imidazoles (22Wilson K.P. McCaffrey P.G. Hsiao K. Pazhanisamy S. Galullo V. Bemis G.W. Fitzgibbon M.J. Caron P.R. Murcko M.A. Su M.S.S. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Indeed, we saw enhanced cross-linking of 125I-SB 206718 to this mutant p38. In contrast, substitution with a bulky residue such as Met resulted in reduced binding and inhibition consistent with its blocking access to the fluorophenyl pocket. However, our inhibition results do not agree quantitatively with the published work (22Wilson K.P. McCaffrey P.G. Hsiao K. Pazhanisamy S. Galullo V. Bemis G.W. Fitzgibbon M.J. Caron P.R. Murcko M.A. Su M.S.S. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), where substitution of Thr-106 by Met resulted in complete loss of inhibition by the related SB 202190 up to 30 μm; in our hands, it was still sensitive to inhibitor at 10 μm. This difference might result from the different source of p38, which in our hands was immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells, but in the previous work was expressed in Escherichia coli and activated in vitro with constitutively active MKK6. The idea that the expression system may influence the inhibition results is supported by kinase inhibition data we obtained with extracts from yeast expressing human p38, p38(106M), and p38(MPF), which revealed that, as in bacteria, the single mutation (p38(106M)) is sufficient to convert p38 to an SB 203580-insensitive phenotype at concentrations up to 10 μm. In contrast, mutation of all three residues (MPF) was required for an insensitive phenotype in the mammalian expression system. These differences may be due to additional proteins, which are associated with mammalian p38 immunoprecipitates and which may interact with His-107 or Leu-108 and alter the conformation of p38. The idea that the hinge region is involved in protein/protein interactions is further supported by the existence of dominant negative mutations near this locus in the yeast MAPK homologue FUS3 (2Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 28Brill J.A. Elion E.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 297-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated that alteration of three residues at the back of the ATP binding pocket to Thr-106, His-107, and Leu-108 of p38 is sufficient to confer sensitivity to SB 203580 to p38 homologues such as SAPK3 and SAPK4 and to more distantly related MAPKs such as JNK1. It will be of interest to determine whether introduction of these changes into non-MAPK protein kinases can confer sensitivity to the pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors. Through their altered sensitivity to SB 203580, the mutant p38, SAPK3, SAPK4, and JNK1 now provide tools for further dissecting in vivo pathways in which they have been implicated. In addition, understanding the manner in which pyridinyl imidazoles interact with p38 may now allow synthesis of compounds that specifically interact with other MAPKs but not p38. Mutagenesis of the ATP pocket of p38 and its homologues has revealed distinctions between the residues required to bind pyridinyl imidazoles and those required for kinase activity. This is illustrated in Fig. 7; Panel A shows residues that result in loss of kinase activity together with a model of ATP bound in the ATP pocket of p38. Panel B highlights residues found to increase or decrease cross-linking to SB 206718; these are shown in the context of the x-ray co-crystal structure of SB 203580 bound to p382. The residues that affect kinase activity are consistent with what is known from related crystal structures. For example, Lys-53, Lys-152, and Asp-168 are known catalytic residues conserved in all serine-threonine protein kinases. Val-38, Ile-84, and Leu-171 are highly conserved nonpolar residues in the pocket. Comparison to the activated ERK2 structure suggests that Arg-67 may form an ion-pair interaction with the phosphorylated Thr-180 in the activation loop, which is critical for the domain rotation and closure which occurs upon MAPK activation (27Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ala-157, Asn-114, and Asn-115 are not conserved among kinases. The particularly strong effect of mutating Ala-157 to Leu (the equivalent residue in ERK) may be due to its effect on Met-109 packing, which is different in p38 than in ERK (27Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Among the residues involved in photoaffinity cross-linking to125I-SB 206718, several overlap with those required for kinase activity (Val-38, Lys-53, Arg-67, Ile-84, Lys-152, Ala-157, Leu-167, and Asp-168). As indicated above, many of these are highly conserved in all serine-threonine protein kinases (Lys-53, Lys-152, and Asp-168) or MAPK (Arg-67 and Ile-84). Those residues that affect only125I-SB 206718 cross-linking include Val-30, Tyr-35, and Thr-106. Although Tyr-35 is fairly well conserved, being either a Phe or Tyr in most protein kinases, Val-30 and Thr-106 are not conserved with other MAPKs. All of the mutations that affect cross-linking of125I-SB 206718 are also those that are in intimate contact with its analogue, SB 203580, in the co-crystal structure2with p38 (Fig. 7 B) (see also Refs. 21Tong L.

The peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts FeTMPS, FeTPPS and FeTMPyP (28Stern M.K. Jensen M.P. Kramer K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8735-8736Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 29Salvemini D.

A. 1998; 95: 2659-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) were cytoprotective in both experimental paradigms, demonstrating that the catalytic shunting of PN to an innocuous form, i.e. nitrate, may have therapeutic utility in reducing tissue damage during inflammation. RAW 264.7 cells and the human adenocarcinoma cell line, DLD-1, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Dissociated cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were grown on a glial feeder layer as described previously (30Yamada K.A. Dubinsky J.M. Rothman S.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3230-3236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yoon K-W Covey D.F. Rothman S.M. J. Physiol. 1993; 464: 423-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, 1-day old Sprague-Dawley (Charles River, MA) rat pups were sacrificed, and their hippocampi were surgically removed and then dissociated both mechanically and enzymatically by papain digestion. Debris was removed by low speed centrifugation. Cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells per well on a 96-well plate containing a confluent layer of glia (initial plating of approximately 3100 cells per well 5–6 days previously). Cultures were grown for 7 days in MEM (minus phenol red) supplemented with 0.5% glucose, 0.22% NaHCO3, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% NU-Serum I (Becton Dickinson). No anti-mitotic agents were used. A mixture of cytokines was then added to induce iNOS in this culture system: lipopolysaccharide (0111:B4) at 100 to 200 ng/ml; interferon γ (200 to 400 units/ml); tumore necrosis factor α (150 to 300 units/ml); interleukin 1β (5–10 ng/ml). Five to seven days following the initiation of cytokine treatment, the cultures were analyzed for nitrite production and cell viability. Four aortic rings were prepared from each of five rats. Briefly, thoracic aortas were removed from adult Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized by injection with 10 mg/kg xylaxine and 50 mg/kg ketamine. Connective tissue was carefully trimmed to avoid damage to the endothelium. Rings were cut into 3-mm lengths and placed into a 10-ml tissue bath. In some experiments, the endothelium was removed by gentle rubbing of the ring preparation. Successful removal of the endothelium was confirmed by the lack of a relaxation response to acetylcholine (10 μm). Aortic rings were maintained at 37 °C in Krebs bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.2: 130 mm NaCl, 15 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmd-glucose, and 0.1 mm ascorbic acid bubbled with 5% CO2, 95% O2. Rings were preloaded with 1 g of tension and equilibrated for 30 min with 2–3 buffer changes. After stabilization of the base line, the rings were contracted with 0.1 μm phenylephrine, producing 90–100% contraction. Nitric oxide-mediated relaxation of the precontracted, endothelium-intact rings was produced by cumulative increases in the concentration of exogenously added acetylcholine (1 nm to 10 μm) or by treatment of endothelium-denuded rings with the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (1 nm to 10 μm). Test compounds were added to the tissue bath 10 min prior to acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside addition. Isometric tension was recorded, and relaxation was determined as the percentage of maximum tone developed to phenylephrine. Peroxynitrite and PN decomposition catalysts (28Stern M.K. Jensen M.P. Kramer K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8735-8736Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 29Salvemini D. Wang Zhi-Qiang Stern M.K. Currie M.G. Misko T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2659-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) were synthesized as described previously. The PN concentration was determined prior to use by measuring the absorbance at 302 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 1.67 mm−1 cm−1. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was dissolved at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, that had been vigorously degassed with nitrogen. A 2 mm NO solution was prepared by several minutes of bubbling pure NO gas into the same buffer at ambient temperature. To test the relative nitration efficiency of NO and PN in the presence and absence of PN decomposition catalysts, the stock BSA solution was injected via syringe into the NO solution while stirring. After a 10-min open air incubation, aliquots were collected for analysis. Peroxynitrite was similarly added to BSA in the presence or absence of the PN decomposition catalyst, FeTMPS. Formation of nitrotyrosine residues on the BSA target molecule was monitored by Western blot in each reaction. Briefly, samples (2.5 μg) were solubilized in SDS-Laemmli buffer and heated for 10 min before loading onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose (32Misko T.P. Trotter J.L. Cross A.H. J. Neuroimmunol. 1995; 61: 195-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and subsequently probed for 18 h at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antiserum (raised to PN-treated keyhole limpet hemocyanin, KLH) containing 10 mml-tyrosine (to reduce nonspecific staining). To demonstrate the specificity of staining for nitrotyrosine-like immunoreactivity, a duplicate blot was similarly incubated with 10 mm3-nitro-l-tyrosine. Following extensive washing, the blots were probed with a 1:3000 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate and developed using the Immun-Lite system (Bio-Rad) for detection of antigen by enhanced chemiluminescence. RAW 264.7 cells were plated onto 96-well plates at approximately 2 × 105 cells per well and then grown in Earle's MEM (minus phenol red) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Before the addition of PN, the plates were washed several times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline to remove medium components such as protein and amino acids that might react with the PN pulse. The PN was then added to each well of cells, containing 200 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with or without test compound, followed by gentle swirling. After 15 min at ambient temperature, cells were washed once with medium and incubated with 200 μl per well of 10% Alamar Blue in complete medium for 1–2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to assess cellular viability. At the end of the assay, 100 μl was removed from each well and read on a Pandex fluorescent plate reader at an excitation of 545 nm and an emission wavelength of 575 nm with a 1% gain setting. The mitochondrial generation of the fluorescent product of Alamar Blue was linear over a 2-h period and correlated well with cellular viability and number (data not shown). Viability is expressed as the percent of untreated control following subtraction of the nonspecific dye background. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml of LPS in Earle's MEM (minus phenol red) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Twenty-four h after LPS addition, the conditioned medium was removed, cells were washed, and cellular viability was assessed using Alamar Blue as described above. Primary cultures of neuronal cells and glia (predominantly astrocytes) were treated with cytokines as described above for 5–7 days. To assess viability, representative fields of phase bright cells with neuronal morphology and excluding trypan blue were counted in each of four separate wells. In most cases, a radioimmunoassay for neuron-specific enolase (described below) was also performed to confirm the cell counts since the value obtained for the Alamar Blue assay was a better indicator of glial viability than of neuronal health (glia were present in larger numbers than neurons by the end of each experiment). In order to assess neuronal viability, release of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) from injured and dying neurons into the culture medium was quantitated by radioimmunoassay as described by the manufacturer, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Briefly, 150 μl of conditioned medium was assayed for the γ isozyme of neuron-specific enolase, which, unlike lactate dehydrogenase, is not present in glia. However, serum contains a small amount of this enzyme, the levels of which were taken into account by measuring its presence in the conditioned medium of untreated controls. The radioimmunoassay for protein nitrotyrosine content was a modification of the method of Ischiropoulos et al. (33Ischiropoulos H. Beers M.F. Ohnishi S.T. Fisher D. Garner S.E. Thom S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2260-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Samples were denatured by boiling in SDS and then applied to nitrocellulose. After blocking, rabbit polyclonal anti-serum to nitrotyrosine (1:500 dilution) was incubated with the blot in the presence of blocking buffer (5% non-fat dry milk, 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.25% Tween 20, and 10 mm tyrosine in Tris-buffered saline). The blot was extensively washed and then incubated with 30 μCi/ml of radioiodinated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (protein concentration of approximately 10 μg/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After further washing to remove unbound secondary antibody, the blot was exposed for 5 min or more on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). PN-treated BSA was used as the nitrotyrosine standard to determine the level of protein-bound nitrotyrosine. The sensitivity of this assay was approximately 200 pg of nitrotyrosine. In most assays, the arbitrary PhosphorImager units obtained for the PN-treated control were normalized to 100% in order to assess the concentration dependence of PN decomposition catalyst activity. Immunocytochemical staining was performed as described previously (34Salvemini D. Wang Z-Q. Bourdon D.M. Stern M.K. Currie M.G. Manning P.T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 303: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, cells were lightly fixed in 1% formaldehyde in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature followed by cold 100% ethanol for 5 min. Nonspecific staining was blocked with 3% normal goat serum in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. All subsequent incubations were carried out in this buffer containing 10 mml-tyrosine. For detection of nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity, cells were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of either preimmune serum, an anti-nitrotyrosine polyclonal rabbit serum generated to nitrated keyhole limpet hemocyanin, or the anti-nitrotyrosine serum containing 10 mm nitrotyrosine to eliminate specific staining, followed by sequential incubations with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and an avidin-biotin-glucose oxidase complex (ABC Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 2 h each. The reaction product was visualized using tetranitro blue tetrazolium for approximately 10 min. Nitrite concentrations were measured as described previously using a fluorescent assay (35Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). When indicated, nitrate was converted to nitrite by nitrate reductase before analysis (35Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Tissue culture media and sera were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY), NO gas was from Matheson Gas Products, Inc. (St. Louis, MO), Alamar Blue was from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA), and all other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. To assess the activity of compounds as PN decomposition catalysts, FeTMPS was tested for its ability to reduce the level of protein nitrotyrosine content of bovine serum albumin that had been treated with synthetic peroxynitrite. Fig. 1 A shows a Western blot for nitrotyrosine content of BSA treated with either 2 mmnitric oxide (lane 1) or 1 mm peroxynitrite (lane 4) in the presence (lane 5) or absence of PN catalyst in PBS. As expected, the nitrotyrosine content of PN-treated BSA (lane 4) was greatly elevated over BSA alone (lane 7), NO-treated BSA (lane 1), or PN allowed to decompose in PBS for 15 min prior to addition (lane 8). The nitrotyrosine content of the PN-treated BSA was decreased in the presence of the active catalyst, FeTMPS (10 μm,lane 5), while TMPS (an inactive compound) failed to reduce the detectable signal (lane 6). Antiserum specificity for nitrotyrosine was demonstrated either by competition with excess nitrotyrosine (10 mm) or by conversion of nitrotyrosine to aminotryrosine with 1 m dithionite (data not shown). Fig. 1 B shows the results using a direct radioimmunoassay for nitrotyrosine to analyze the same samples that had been spotted onto nitrocellulose. This quantitative measure for nitrotyrosine confirmed the qualitative results using the Western analysis and was not limited to only protein that had entered the gel. It is interesting to note that the free ligand TMPS, lacking an iron center, produced an apparent increase in the measurable levels of nitrotyrosine, a result that may be explained by the observation that trace contamination with metals such as iron, especially in the presence of potential chelating agents such as TMPS, can catalyze PN-mediated nitration of tyrosine (36Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. van der Woerd M. Smith C. Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 illustrates the concentration-dependent reduction of the nitrotyrosine content of BSA treated with PN (1 mm) in the presence of increasing amounts of the active catalyst FeTMPS. This contrasted with the profile obtained using ascorbate, a known PN scavenger, where concentrations equimolar (or higher) to the PN challenge were required to see an effect. TMPS, on the other hand, did not reduce the level of protein-bound nitrotyrosine, indicating that it is neither a PN catalyst nor a scavenger of PN (data not shown). To investigate the ability of PN catalysts to reduce the PN-mediated modification of proteins in a cellular milieu, immunohistochemical staining of cells in culture for nitrotyrosine was performed. The human adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1 showed surprising resistance to PN-mediated cellular damage (data not shown). When cells were treated with increasing concentrations of PN, a corresponding increase in the number of cells that stained with nitrotyrosine-specific rabbit antiserum (Fig. 3 A) was observed. When the final concentration of PN was kept constant at 200 μm, cell staining was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner using the active catalyst FeTMPS (Fig. 3 B). All positive staining was competed by incubation with excess nitrotyrosine (data not shown). Cellular injury is a very real consequence of exposure to PN, a powerful oxidant of not only protein but also nucleic acid and lipid. A typical concentration-response curve for cellular injury to RAW 264.7 cells by exogenously added peroxynitrite is shown in Fig. 4 A. Cellular viability was measured by monitoring the reduction of the electron acceptor Alamar Blue to a fluorescent product by the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Fig. 4, B and C, illustrates the cytoprotection afforded by FeTMPyP and FeTPPS, respectively, against exogenously added synthetic PN. Nitrotyrosine is a relatively specific and stable biochemical marker for the generation of PN. The mechanism of action of PN decomposition catalysts should favor a reduction in the nitrotyrosine content of cellular proteins exposed to PN. When the level of protein-bound nitrotyrosine following a PN pulse was measured by radioimmunoassay analysis of cellular contents either released into the medium (Fig. 5) or remaining on cells (data not shown), there was a strong correlation between nitrotyrosine level and the size of the PN pulse (Fig. 5 A). In both cases, the level of nitrotyrosine was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by the active compound FeTPPS (Fig. 5 B). Fig. 6 illustrates the difference in the concentration-response profile for a PN catalyst compared with a typical free radical scavenger such as ascorbate which reacts stoichiometrically with the oxidant until its reactive moieties are depleted. There was an essentially complete protection of RAW cells from a 200 μm PN challenge in the presence of 10 μm FeTMPS. This is in sharp contrast to ascorbic acid which was fully protective at a 2-fold molar excess to PN, and to TMPS which was inactive at all concentrations tested. Nitrotyrosine content of released intracellular proteins was used as a marker for the extent of PN-mediated injury in these cells. FeTMPS reduced the level of detectable protein-bound nitrotyrosine release (Fig. 6 B). There was no cytoprotection observed when FeCl3 was used or when catalyst was added after PN application (data not shown). The free ligands TPPS, TMPyP, and TMPS are inactive as decomposition catalysts and were unable to protect from PN-mediated damage. We next examined the cytoprotective capacity of PN decomposition catalysts against endogenously produced PN. The murine monocyte-macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, can be stimulated to express iNOS with endotoxin. Enzyme activity was monitored by measuring nitrite accumulation in the conditioned medium. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the induction of iNOS markedly reduced cell viability (≅ 20%). Inhibition of cellular iNOS activity with l-NMA or the selective iNOS inhibitors aminoguanidine (data not shown) andl-NIL (32Misko T.P. Trotter J.L. Cross A.H. J. Neuroimmunol. 1995; 61: 195-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 39Misko T.P. Moore W.M. Kasten T.P. Nickols G.A. Corbett J.A. Tilton R.G. McDaniel M.L. Williamson J.R.

Chem. 1994; 37: 3886-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in cellular viability accompanied by a corresponding decrease in accumulated nitrite (Fig. 7) when compared with the endotoxin control. As shown in Fig. 8, co-incubation of the PN decomposition catalysts with endotoxin increased cellular viability when examined 24 h after the beginning of treatment. Fig. 8illustrates the cytoprotective profile for the active catalysts FeTMPS (Fig. 8 A) and FeTPPS (Fig. 8 B). The free ligands (i.e. TMPS, TPPS) afforded cytoprotection at much higher concentrations than the active catalysts. To rule out metabolic conversion of the free ligand to an active form, the inactive analog ZnTMPS and the weak catalyst MnTPPS were tested (Fig. 8 B). Neither compound showed protective effects at the highest concentrations applied. We next extended our studies utilizing cell lines to primary cultures of neurons and glia, cells known to be susceptible to cytokine-mediated injury. In fact, cytokine-mediated injury accompanied by expression of iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 may contribute significantly to the neural damage associated with human disorders such as stroke. Accordingly, we examined the cytoprotection afforded by PN decomposition catalysts on mixed cultures of dissociated hippocampal neurons and glia (predominantly astrocytes) treated with a mixture of cytokines and endotoxin. Cellular viability was assessed using several biochemical criteria: for neurons, by counting phase bright trypan blue impermeant cells exhibiting neuronal morphology and by measuring neuron-specific enolase release from injured and dying cells; and for glia (comprising the majority of the cells per well), by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase from injured and dying cells or by assessing the cellular capacity to convert Alamar Blue to its fluorescent product by functional mitochondria. Primary cultures were exposed to cytokines and endotoxin for 5–7 days at the end of which viability and NOS activit"

Liposomes composed of a cationic lipid (DOTAP, DOGS, DDAB), a neutral lipid (DOPE), and a phospholipid derivative of polyethylene glycol (PEG-PE) formed a complex with 18-mer phosphorothioate up to ODN/lipid molar ratio of 0.25. The complexes showed intact vesicular structures similar to original liposomes and their size (100–130 nm) was unchanged after several weeks of storage, whereas complexes lacking PEG-PE showed progressive aggregation and/or precipitation. After exposure to human plasma, PEG-modified cationic liposomes retained over 60% of the originally bound ODN. PEG-coated complexes resulted in 4–13-fold enhancement of the ODN uptake by human breast cancer cells in serum-supplemented growth medium, relative to free ODN. Complexes containing conjugated anti-HER2 F(ab′) fragments at the distal termini of PEG chains efficiently delivered ODN primarily into the cytoplasm and nuclei of HER2 overexpressing cancer cells and greatly enhanced the biological activity of antisense ODN. The development of PEG-modified cationic liposomes may lead to improved ODN potency in vivo.

However, the biological efficacy of ODN is restrained by their poor cellular uptake and availability to hybridize to their RNA or DNA targets present in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus (1Nagel K.M. Holstad S.G. Isenberg K.E. Pharmacotherapy. 1993; 13: 177-188PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular uptake of ODN, as well as their activity in cell cultures, can be improved by cationic liposomes (2Bennett C.F. Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6077-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Such formulations, however, require substantial excess of cationic lipid over ODN (4Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1996; 13: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and are unsuitable for in vivouse because of inadequate particle size stability and increased risk of toxicity associated with the high dose of cationic lipid co-administered with the therapeutic dose of ODN. Furthermore, positively charged particulates are prone to nonspecific interactions with plasma proteins and negatively charged cell surfaces. This may lead to destabilization, dissociation, and rapid clearance of the liposome-ODN complexes by the mononuclear phagocyte system before reaching the diseased tissue.PEG-PE, a phospholipid derivative of the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (M r = 2,000), increases particle stability of small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine liposomes in plasma and reduces their interaction with biological macromolecules and/or cell surfaces (7Woodle M.C. Lasic D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 171-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). PEG-PE containing sterically stabilized liposomes have long circulation lifetimes, show high accumulation in pathological foci, such as tumors (7Woodle M.C. Lasic D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 171-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 8Papahadjopoulos D. Allen T.M. Gabizon A. Mayhew E. Matthay K. Huang S.K. Lee K.D. Woodle M.C. Lasic D.D. Redemann C.

Philippot J.R Schuber F. Liposomes As Tools in Basic Research and Industry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 177-188Google Scholar). More recently, studies have shown accumulation in mice tumor of encapsulated antisense ODN using sterically stabilized liposomes (11Woodle M.C. Raynaud F.I. Dizik M. Meyer O. Huang S.K. Jaeger A.J. Brown B.D. Orr R. Judson I.R. Papahadjopoulos D. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1997; 16: 1731-1734Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Specific delivery of sterically stabilized liposomes to target cells can be achieved by attachment of target-seeking molecules, such as antibodies or their fragments, preferably at the distal ends of liposome-associated polyethylene glycol chains (12Allen T.M. Brandeis E. Hansen C.B. Kao G.Y. Zalipsky S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1237: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the use of this system for the delivery of ODN may be limited by its low entrapment efficiency and difficulty for the entrapped ODN to leave the liposome interior.Recently, it was found that incorporation of PEG-PE can stabilize the particles of cationic liposome-plasmid DNA complexes (13Hong K. Zheng W. Baker A. Papahadjopoulos D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that incorporation of PEG-PE into cationic liposomes will increase particle stability of liposome-ODN complexes and make them more attractive for medical use. Using an 18-mer phosphorothioate as a model for any type of biologically active ODN, we show here that modification with PEG-PE not only prevents aggregation and dramatically increases particle stability of cationic liposome-ODN complexes but also allows extraordinarily high loading of ODN, resulting in a particle with overall neutral or negative charge. We further demonstrate that complexes of ODN with PEG-modified cationic liposomes have good stability in human plasma, and retain ultrastructural characteristics of original liposomes. We also show that PEG-coated cationic liposomes enhance the cellular uptake of ODN in serum-supplemented cell growth medium and that conjugation of antibody fragments recognizing the HER2 receptor on such cationic liposome-ODN complexes triggers efficient delivery of ODN to their sites of action (cytoplasm/nucleus) resulting in enhanced biological activity of antisense ODN in a target-specific manner.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we explored the possibility of forming PEG-modified cationic liposome-ODN complexes. We studied their physico-chemical characteristics, their stability in biological fluids, and the applicability of the above-cited targeting method in vitroin order to develop a suitable ODN delivery system for future in vivo applications.Binding of ODN to cationic liposomes was very efficient even when containing a relatively high amount of PEG-PE (5.7 mol%) (Fig. 1). Evidently, PEG coating does not shield the positively charged liposome surface from interaction with ODN. Furthermore, such liposomes can bind an impressive amount of ODN without the loss of structural stability in a wide range of ODN/lipid charge ratios. When liposomes were composed of DOTAP or DDAB, cationic lipids bearing single positive charge, the amounts of bound ODN exceeded the charge equivalent and, with gradually decreased affinity, the binding continued until the physical limit of one ODN molecule per one positively charged lipid group. This mechanism afforded exceptionally high loads of ODN in the complex without aggregation. Thus, after overnight incubation of PEG-coated DOTAP/DOPE liposomes with excess ODN, the resulting complex contained up to 0.25 mol of ODN per mol of total lipid (Fig. 1). Obviously, at such high ODN content the number of negatively charged groups in the complex far exceeded the number of available positive charges. This property of PEG-modified cationic liposomes is remarkable, since it has been shown (21Jääskeläinen I. Mönkkönen J. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and confirmed by our present data (Table II) that ODN induce aggregation and fusion of cationic liposomes as a function of ODN/lipid charge ratio. Modification of cationic liposomes with PEG-PE allowed the formation of ODN complexes that are stable in size over prolonged storage (Table II). The stabilizing effect of PEG coating on the cationic liposome-ODN complex is likely to result from preventing cross-linking (and thus aggregation and precipitation) of the vesicles by ODN molecules whose stretched length approximates the extension length of the liposome PEG coating in “brush” regime (5–7 nm at ≥ 4 mol% PEG-PE) (22Woodle M.C. Collins L.R. Sponsler E. Kossovsky N. Papahadjopoulos D. Martin F.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 902-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Kenworthy A.K. Simon S.A. McIntosh T.J. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1903-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), as well as avoiding bilayer contact needed for the aggregation to occur. Stabilization of cationic liposomes by PEG coating also contributed to high ODN-binding capacity by allowing the complex to pass through the charge neutralization point at increasing ODN/lipid ratio without aggregation.Modification of cationic liposomes with PEG-PE not only increased particle stability after complexation with ODN, but also resulted in practically complete preservation of the original vesicles in the complex, as shown by freeze-fracture electron microscopy (Figs. 3 and4). Preservation of the original small size of the vesicles after complexation with ODN may favor their better extravasation into the target tissue in vivo since the size limit for liposome extravasation ranges between 400 and 600 nm (24Yuan F. Dellian M. Fukumura D. Leunig M. Berk D.A. Torchilin V.P. Jain R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3752-3756PubMed Google Scholar).Addition of ODN even at low concentrations sharply modified the zeta potential of PEG-modified cationic liposomes to the saturation value of –22 to –25 mV, reached at approximately stoichiometric charge ratio of ODN to cationic lipid. The existence of this plateau suggests shielding effects of PEG on the excess negative charge carried by ODN nucleotides which are not associated with lipid positive charges. Although the pharmacokinetic behavior of PEG-modified cationic liposome-ODN complexes has not been completely characterized as yet (the study is in progress), the shielding effect of PEG on excess negative charges of liposome-bound ODN may have a beneficial effect on their ability to evade mononuclear phagocyte clearance.PEG-modification increased the stability of cationic liposome-ODN complexes not only against aggregation, but also against dissociation and disintegration in the presence of plasma proteins. After incubation with plasma, practically all of the lipid and the major portion of the originally bound ODN was retained in the complex (Fig. 5). Due to the high initial load of ODN ([ODN/LIP]bound = 0.2), the remaining ODN still constituted an impressive proportion of the complex, about 50% by mass.Complexation of ODN with PEG-modified cationic liposomes enhanced the cellular uptake of ODN severalfold, similar to that observed with nonmodified cationic liposomes (2Bennett C.F. Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1996; 13: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In an attempt to increase the cellular ODN uptake in a targeted manner, we modified the complex with a targeting device previously developed for neutral liposomes (15Kirpotin D. Park J.W. Hong K. Zalipsky S. Li W.-L. Carter P. Benz C.C. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In the case of PEG-modified complexes, conjugated anti-HER2 F(ab′) fragments further increased the cellular uptake of both lipid and ODN by a factor of 2.3–2.6, regardless of the cellular expression level of the target antigen. Since this enhancement was not completely abolished by preincubation of cells with free F(ab′) that blocked the surface antigen, it must be attributed to additional nonspecific interactions which at present are poorly understood. The targeting effect, however, revealed itself in an unexpected way, namely, as dramatically increased diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of ODN in target-positive (SK-BR-3) cells. The green fluorescence has been attributed exclusively to the presence of ODN since it was shown that fluorescent ODN metabolites are quickly discarded from cells (25Fisher T.L. Terhorst T. Cao X. Wagner R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3857-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Depending on their mode of action, ODN must either accumulate free within the cytoplasm to hybridize to their target mRNA, or in the nucleus when they are designed to be complementary to sites of transcription factor binding, splicing sites, nascent transcripts or to form a triple helix with DNA (26Thierry A.R. Takle G.B. Akhtar S. Delivery Strategies for Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapeutics. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 199-221Google Scholar). Herein, we show that PEG-coated cationic liposome-ODN complexes conjugated to anti-HER2 F(ab′) at their surface efficiently delivered ODN diffusely in the cytosol and to a larger extent in the nucleus of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Because there was no co-localization of ODN and lipid in these regions, ODN was presumably free of lipid, which is a requirement for their biological activity. When the specific interaction between the targeted complex and cell surface p185HER2 was blocked or missing, FITC-ODN was exclusively localized in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment, evidence of the importance of antibody-antigen interactions for successful delivery of ODN to their sites of action. We address the dependence of the cellular disposition of ODN upon the targetability of the delivery system used, in terms of the ability for ODN to evade endocytic compartments. It has been shown that after endocytosis of cationic liposome-ODN complexes, the escape of ODN from early endosomes into the cytoplasm is a critical step for their biological activity (4Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1996; 13: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Therefore, HER2 receptor-mediated endocytosis could direct the targeted complex into early endosomes that may be more permissive for the escape of ODN into the cytoplasm than the early endosomes formed in response to non-target specific interactions of the cell membrane with the complex itself. Confirmation of this hypothesis as well as the determination of the exact mechanism by which HER2-targeted complexes deliver ODN into the cytoplasm and nucleus of target-positive cells require further study.Bcl-2 proto-oncogene encodes a 26-kDa protein that promotes cell survival by blocking programmed cell death (also termed apoptosis) (27Bagg A. Cossman J. Benz C.C. Liu T. Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes in Human Malignancies. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1993: 141-165Google Scholar). Bcl-2 protein has been detected in a wide variety of cancers including breast carcinomas (28Reed J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 501-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To test the cell specificity of our ODN delivery systems in terms of biological antisense activity, we took advantage of the human breast cancer cell line BT-474, which both expresses the bcl-2 protein (29Haldar S. Negrini M. Monne M. Sabbioni S. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2095-2097PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpresses the HER2 receptor (20Lewis G.D. Figari I. Fendly B. Wong W.-L. Carter P. Gorman C. Shepard H.M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1993; 37: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Importantly, in a nontargeted complex bcl-2 antisense did not promote any detectable inhibition of the level of expression of the bcl-2 protein in BT-474 breast cancer cells, whereas when the targeted system was employed, a 46% inhibition of cellular bcl-2 level was found over untreated cells. However, in accordance to cell uptake experiments (see Table II), presaturation of the HER2 receptor with free F(ab′) fragments did not block entirely the antisense activity of ODN when delivered by the HER2-targeted liposomes, where the level of bcl-2 expression reached about the same as when free antisense molecules were used. In view of these data, it seems that cell binding/internalization of positively charged particles, which involve both nonspecific (electrostatic) and specific (ligand-receptor) interactions (the complexes used had a net positive charge, [+/−] = 4:1) can only be rendered partially tissue-specific. Therefore, despite a drastic enhancement in uptake by target cells, in intracytosolic/intranuclear ODN accumulation, and in antisense activity observed when ODN was delivered by HER2-targeted liposomes compared with non-targeted liposomes, we believe that there is still a need for additional developments (currently in progress in our laboratory) to further optimize the ODN delivery system in terms of cell specificity.PEG-modified cationic liposomes described in this study offer a number of advantages as carriers for cellular delivery of ODN. They allow exceptionally high loads of ODN without loss of structural stability. The resulting complexes are stable against aggregation and retain both their ODN load in blood plasma and the ability to enhance cellular delivery of ODN in the presence of serum. The presence of PEG also limits the negative zeta potential observed on the surface of the complexes. Finally, PEG-modified cationic liposome-ODN complexes can be made to incorporate the previously developed liposome targeting technology, resulting in efficient delivery of ODN into the cytoplasm and nuclei of target cells as well as enhanced antisense activity. In conclusion, PEG-modified cationic liposomes may provide a useful step in the development of an efficient pharmaceutical carrier for systemicin vivo delivery of ODN.

However, the biological efficacy of ODN is restrained by their poor cellular uptake and availability to hybridize to their RNA or DNA targets present in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus (1Nagel K.M. Holstad S.G. Isenberg K.E. Pharmacotherapy. 1993; 13: 177-188PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular uptake of ODN, as well as their activity in cell cultures, can be improved by cationic liposomes (2Bennett C.F. Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6077-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Such formulations, however, require substantial excess of cationic lipid over ODN (4Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1996; 13: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and are unsuitable for in vivouse because of inadequate particle size stability and increased risk of toxicity associated with the high dose of cationic lipid co-administered with the therapeutic dose of ODN. Furthermore, positively charged particulates are prone to nonspecific interactions with plasma proteins and negatively charged cell surfaces. This may lead to destabilization, dissociation, and rapid clearance of the liposome-ODN complexes by the mononuclear phagocyte system before reaching the diseased tissue. PEG-PE, a phospholipid derivative of the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (M r = 2,000), increases particle stability of small unilamellar phosphatidylcholine liposomes in plasma and reduces their interaction with biological macromolecules and/or cell surfaces (7Woodle M.C. Lasic D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 171-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). PEG-PE containing sterically stabilized liposomes have long circulation lifetimes, show high accumulation in pathological foci, such as tumors (7Woodle M.C. Lasic D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 171-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 8Papahadjopoulos D. Allen T.M. Gabizon A. Mayhew E. Matthay K. Huang S.K. Lee K.D. Woodle M.C. Lasic D.D. Redemann C.

Philippot J.R Schuber F. Liposomes As Tools in Basic Research and Industry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 177-188Google Scholar). More recently, studies have shown accumulation in mice tumor of encapsulated antisense ODN using sterically stabilized liposomes (11Woodle M.C. Raynaud F.I. Dizik M. Meyer O. Huang S.K. Jaeger A.J. Brown B.D. Orr R. Judson I.R. Papahadjopoulos D. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1997; 16: 1731-1734Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Specific delivery of sterically stabilized liposomes to target cells can be achieved by attachment of target-seeking molecules, such as antibodies or their fragments, preferably at the distal ends of liposome-associated polyethylene glycol chains (12Allen T.M. Brandeis E. Hansen C.B. Kao G.Y. Zalipsky S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1237: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the use of this system for the delivery of ODN may be limited by its low entrapment efficiency and difficulty for the entrapped ODN to leave the liposome interior. Recently, it was found that incorporation of PEG-PE can stabilize the particles of cationic liposome-plasmid DNA complexes (13Hong K. Zheng W. Baker A. Papahadjopoulos D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that incorporation of PEG-PE into cationic liposomes will increase particle stability of liposome-ODN complexes and make them more attractive for medical use. Using an 18-mer phosphorothioate as a model for any type of biologically active ODN, we show here that modification with PEG-PE not only prevents aggregation and dramatically increases particle stability of cationic liposome-ODN complexes but also allows extraordinarily high loading of ODN, resulting in a particle with overall neutral or negative charge. We further demonstrate that complexes of ODN with PEG-modified cationic liposomes have good stability in human plasma, and retain ultrastructural characteristics of original liposomes. We also show that PEG-coated cationic liposomes enhance the cellular uptake of ODN in serum-supplemented cell growth medium and that conjugation of antibody fragments recognizing the HER2 receptor on such cationic liposome-ODN complexes triggers efficient delivery of ODN to their sites of action (cytoplasm/nucleus) resulting in enhanced biological activity of antisense ODN in a target-specific manner.

Dellian M. Fukumura D. Leunig M. Berk D.A. Torchilin V.P. Jain R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3752-3756PubMed Google Scholar).Addition of ODN even at low concentrations sharply modified the zeta potential of PEG-modified cationic liposomes to the saturation value of –22 to –25 mV, reached at approximately stoichiometric charge ratio of ODN to cationic lipid.

In an attempt to increase the cellular ODN uptake in a targeted manner, we modified the complex with a targeting device previously developed for neutral liposomes (15Kirpotin D. Park J.W. Hong K.

Bcl-2 protein has been detected in a wide variety of cancers including breast carcinomas (28Reed J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 501-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To test the cell specificity of our ODN delivery systems in terms of biological antisense activity, we took advantage of the human breast cancer cell line BT-474, which both expresses the bcl-2 protein (29Haldar S. Negrini M. Monne M. Sabbioni S. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2095-2097PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpresses the HER2 receptor (20Lewis G.D. Figari I. Fendly B. Wong W.-L. Carter P. Gorman C.

Importantly, in a nontargeted complex bcl-2 antisense did not promote any detectable inhibition of the level of expression of the bcl-2 protein in BT-474 breast cancer cells, whereas when the targeted system was employed, a 46% inhibition of cellular bcl-2 level was found over untreated cells. However, in accordance to cell uptake experiments (see Table II), presaturation of the HER2 receptor with free F(ab′) fragments did not block entirely the antisense activity of ODN when delivered by the HER2-targeted liposomes, where the level of bcl-2 expression reached about the same as when free antisense molecules were used. In view of these data, it seems that cell binding/internalization of positively charged particles, which involve both nonspecific (electrostatic) and specific (ligand-receptor) interactions (the complexes used had a net positive charge, [+/−] = 4:1) can only be rendered partially tissue-specific. Therefore, despite a drastic enhancement in uptake by target cells, in intracytosolic/intranuclear ODN accumulation, and in antisense activity observed when ODN was delivered by HER2-targeted liposomes compared with non-targeted liposomes, we believe that there is still a need for additional developments (currently in progress in our laboratory) to further optimize the ODN delivery system in terms of cell specificity.PEG-modified cationic liposomes described in this study offer a number of advantages as carriers for cellular delivery of ODN.

The presence of PEG also limits the negative zeta potential observed on the surface of the complexes. Finally, PEG-modified cationic liposome-ODN complexes can be made to incorporate the previously developed liposome targeting technology, resulting in efficient delivery of ODN into the cytoplasm and nuclei of target cells as well as enhanced antisense activity. In conclusion, PEG-modified cationic liposomes may provide a useful step in the development of an efficient pharmaceutical carrier for systemicin vivo delivery of ODN. In this study, we explored the possibility of forming PEG-modified cationic liposome-ODN complexes. We studied their physico-chemical characteristics, their stability in biological fluids, and the applicability of the above-cited targeting method in vitroin order to develop a suitable ODN delivery system for future in vivo applications. Binding of ODN to cationic liposomes was very efficient even when containing a relatively high amount of PEG-PE (5.7 mol%) (Fig. 1). Evidently, PEG coating does not shield the positively charged liposome surface from interaction with ODN. Furthermore, such liposomes can bind an impressive amount of ODN without the loss of structural stability in a wide range of ODN/lipid charge ratios. When liposomes were composed of DOTAP or DDAB, cationic lipids bearing single positive charge, the amounts of bound ODN exceeded the charge equivalent and, with gradually decreased affinity, the binding continued until the physical limit of one ODN molecule per one positively charged lipid group. This mechanism afforded exceptionally high loads of ODN in the complex without aggregation. Thus, after overnight incubation of PEG-coated DOTAP/DOPE liposomes with excess ODN, the resulting complex contained up to 0.25 mol of ODN per mol of total lipid (Fig. 1). Obviously, at such high ODN content the number of negatively charged groups in the complex far exceeded the number of available positive charges. This property of PEG-modified cationic liposomes is remarkable, since it has been shown (21Jääskeläinen I. Mönkkönen J. Urtti A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and confirmed by our present data (Table II) that ODN induce aggregation and fusion of cationic liposomes as a function of ODN/lipid charge ratio. Modification of cationic liposomes with PEG-PE allowed the formation of ODN complexes that are stable in size over prolonged storage (Table II). The stabilizing effect of PEG coating on the cationic liposome-ODN complex is likely to result from preventing cross-linking (and thus aggregation and precipitation) of the vesicles by ODN molecules whose stretched length approximates the extension length of the liposome PEG coating in “brush” regime (5–7 nm at ≥ 4 mol% PEG-PE) (22Woodle M.C. Collins L.R. Sponsler E. Kossovsky N. Papahadjopoulos D. Martin F.J. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 902-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Kenworthy A.K. Simon S.A. McIntosh T.J. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1903-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), as well as avoiding bilayer contact needed for the aggregation to occur. Stabilization of cationic liposomes by PEG coating also contributed to high ODN-binding capacity by allowing the complex to pass through the charge neutralization point at increasing ODN/lipid ratio without aggregation. Modification of cationic liposomes with PEG-PE not only increased particle stability after complexation with ODN, but also resulted in practically complete preservation of the original vesicles in the complex, as shown by freeze-fracture electron microscopy (Figs. 3 and4). Preservation of the original small size of the vesicles after complexation with ODN may favor their better extravasation into the target tissue in vivo since the size limit for liposome extravasation ranges between 400 and 600 nm (24Yuan F. Dellian M. Fukumura D. Leunig M. Berk D.A. Torchilin V.P. Jain R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3752-3756PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of ODN even at low concentrations sharply modified the zeta potential of PEG-modified cationic liposomes to the saturation value of –22 to –25 mV, reached at approximately stoichiometric charge ratio of ODN to cationic lipid. The existence of this plateau suggests shielding effects of PEG on the excess negative charge carried by ODN nucleotides which are not associated with lipid positive charges. Although the pharmacokinetic behavior of PEG-modified cationic liposome-ODN complexes has not been completely characterized as yet (the study is in progress), the shielding effect of PEG on excess negative charges of liposome-bound ODN may have a beneficial effect on their ability to evade mononuclear phagocyte clearance. PEG-modification increased the stability of cationic liposome-ODN complexes not only against aggregation, but also against dissociation and disintegration in the presence of plasma proteins. After incubation with plasma, practically all of the lipid and the major portion of the originally bound ODN was retained in the complex (Fig. 5). Due to the high initial load of ODN ([ODN/LIP]bound = 0.2), the remaining ODN still constituted an impressive proportion of the complex, about 50% by mass. Complexation of ODN with PEG-modified cationic liposomes enhanced the cellular uptake of ODN severalfold, similar to that observed with nonmodified cationic liposomes (2Bennett C.F. Chiang M.-Y. Chan H. Shoemaker J.E.E. Mirabelli C.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1996; 13: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In an attempt to increase the cellular ODN uptake in a targeted manner, we modified the complex with a targeting device previously developed for neutral liposomes (15Kirpotin D. Park J.W. Hong K. Zalipsky S. Li W.-L. Carter P. Benz C.C. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In the case of PEG-modified complexes, conjugated anti-HER2 F(ab′) fragments further increased the cellular uptake of both lipid and ODN by a factor of 2.3–2.6, regardless of the cellular expression level of the target antigen. Since this enhancement was not completely abolished by preincubation of cells with free F(ab′) that blocked the surface antigen, it must be attributed to additional nonspecific interactions which at present are poorly understood. The targeting effect, however, revealed itself in an unexpected way, namely, as dramatically increased diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of ODN in target-positive (SK-BR-3) cells. The green fluorescence has been attributed exclusively to the presence of ODN since it was shown that fluorescent ODN metabolites are quickly discarded from cells (25Fisher T.L. Terhorst T. Cao X. Wagner R.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3857-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Depending on their mode of action, ODN must either accumulate free within the cytoplasm to hybridize to their target mRNA, or in the nucleus when they are designed to be complementary to sites of transcription factor binding, splicing sites, nascent transcripts or to form a triple helix with DNA (26Thierry A.R. Takle G.B. Akhtar S. Delivery Strategies for Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapeutics. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 199-221Google Scholar). Herein, we show that PEG-coated cationic liposome-ODN complexes conjugated to anti-HER2 F(ab′) at their surface efficiently delivered ODN diffusely in the cytosol and to a larger extent in the nucleus of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Because there was no co-localization of ODN and lipid in these regions, ODN was presumably free of lipid, which is a requirement for their biological activity. When the specific interaction between the targeted complex and cell surface p185HER2 was blocked or missing, FITC-ODN was exclusively localized in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment, evidence of the importance of antibody-antigen interactions for successful delivery of ODN to their sites of action. We address the dependence of the cellular disposition of ODN upon the targetability of the delivery system used, in terms of the ability for ODN to evade endocytic compartments. It has been shown that after endocytosis of cationic liposome-ODN complexes, the escape of ODN from early endosomes into the cytoplasm is a critical step for their biological activity (4Zelphati O. Szoka Jr., F.C. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1996; 13: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Therefore, HER2 receptor-mediated endocytosis could direct the targeted complex into early endosomes that may be more permissive for the escape of ODN into the cytoplasm than the early endosomes formed in response to non-target specific interactions of the cell membrane with the complex itself. Confirmation of this hypothesis as well as the determination of the exact mechanism by which HER2-targeted complexes deliver ODN into the cytoplasm and nucleus of target-positive cells require further study. Bcl-2 proto-oncogene encodes a 26-kDa protein that promotes cell survival by blocking programmed cell death (also termed apoptosis) (27Bagg A. Cossman J. Benz C.C. Liu T. Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes in Human Malignancies. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1993: 141-165Google Scholar). Bcl-2 protein has been detected in a wide variety of cancers including breast carcinomas (28Reed J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 501-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To test the cell specificity of our ODN delivery systems in terms of biological antisense activity, we took advantage of the human breast cancer cell line BT-474, which both expresses the bcl-2 protein (29Haldar S. Negrini M. Monne M. Sabbioni S. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2095-2097PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpresses the HER2 receptor (20Lewis G.D. Figari I. Fendly B. Wong W.-L. Carter P. Gorman C. Shepard H.M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1993; 37: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Importantly, in a nontargeted complex bcl-2 antisense did not promote any detectable inhibition of the level of expression of the bcl-2 protein in BT-474 breast cancer cells, whereas when the targeted system was employed, a 46% inhibition of cellular bcl-2 level was found over untreated cells. However, in accordance to cell uptake experiments (see Table II), presaturation of the HER2 receptor with free F(ab′) fragments did not block entirely the antisense activity of ODN when delivered by the HER2-targeted liposomes, where the level of bcl-2 expression reached about the same as when free antisense molecules were used. In view of these data, it seems that cell binding/internalization of positively charged particles, which involve both nonspecific (electrostatic) and specific (ligand-receptor) interactions (the complexes used had a net positive charge, [+/−] = 4:1) can only be rendered partially tissue-specific. Therefore, despite a drastic enhancement in uptake by target cells, in intracytosolic/intranuclear ODN accumulation, and in antisense activity observed when ODN was delivered by HER2-targeted liposomes compared with non-targeted liposomes, we believe that there is still a need for additional developments (currently in progress in our laboratory) to further optimize the ODN delivery system in terms of cell specificity. PEG-modified cationic liposomes described in this study offer a number of advantages as carriers for cellular delivery of ODN. They allow exceptionally high loads of ODN without loss of structural stability. The resulting complexes are stable against aggregation and retain both their ODN load in blood plasma and the ability to enhance cellular delivery of ODN in the presence of serum. The presence of PEG also limits the negative zeta potential observed on the surface of the complexes. Finally, PEG-modified cationic liposome-ODN complexes can be made to incorporate the previously developed liposome targeting technology, resulting in efficient delivery of ODN into the cytoplasm and nuclei of target cells as well as enhanced antisense activity. In conclusion, PEG-modified cationic liposomes may provide a useful step in the development of an efficient pharmaceutical carrier for systemicin vivo delivery of ODN."

Moreover, purified FLAG-Fmrp bound to only a subset of brain mRNA, including the 3′ untranslated regions of myelin basic protein message and its own message. Recombinant isoform 4, lacking the RGG boxes but maintaining both KH domains, was also purified and was found to only weakly interact with RNA.

The RGG box has been found in hnRNP 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, human nuclear ribonucleoprotein; mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein particle; ERBB, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 70 mm NH4Cl; UTR, untranslated region. 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, human nuclear ribonucleoprotein; mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein particle; ERBB, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 70 mm NH4Cl; UTR, untranslated region. U, hnRNP A1, nucleolin, and fibrillarin and has been shown to autonomously bind homopolymeric RNA (8Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid context surrounding the RGG box may influence the specificity and avidity of the RNA-nucleic acid interaction (8Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 9Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). The KH domain is highly conserved in hnRNP K, yeast MER-1 splicing regulator, Sam68, and chicken vigillin, among other RNA-binding proteins (10Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 2: 1193-1198Google Scholar). Fmrp expression is widespread but not ubiquitous. The majority of Fmrp is associated with polyribosomes and has been found to form an mRNP, which can be stripped from ribosomes by EDTA or RNase treatment (11Khandjian E.W. Corbin F. Woerly S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A prevailing model suggests that Fmrp directly binds specific mRNAs in the nucleus as part of a hnRNP particle and then mediates its transport to the cytoplasm and delivery of the mRNP to the ribosome (4Eberhart D.E. Warren S.T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 679-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Eberhart D.E. Malter H.E. Feng Y. Warren S.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Homopolymer binding assays performed with in vitro-translated Fmrp and carboxyl-terminal truncated Fmrp proteins suggested a role for both the KH domain and RGG box in RNA binding (15Siomi H. Choi M. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1994; 77: 33-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, whether the observed RNA binding by Fmrp is mediated directly by the KH domain or through a KH-associated protein present in the translation mixture is unknown (5Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1993; 74: 291-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 6Ashley Jr., C.A. Wilkinson K.D. Reines D. Warren S.T.

Because these in vitro systems contain concentrated quantities of ribosomes and other translation factors and because Fmrp has been shown to associate with mRNP particles and polyribosomes, direct binding of the Fmrp and RNA could not be verified. Because Fmrp associates with large protein complexes, we could not disregard the possibility that another protein in the translation mix was actually binding the RNA and that Fmrp was associating tightly yet peripherally with an RNA-binding protein in the RNP complex (5Siomi H.

Furthermore, if the Fmrp was truly making direct contact with the RNA, the specificity of the interaction might be modulated by other proteins bound to Fmrp. Similar situations exist for other RNA-binding proteins, such as the mammalian erythropoietin RNA-binding protein ERBP (16Scandurro A.B. Rondon I.J. Wilson R.B. Tenenbaum S.A. Garry R.F. Beckman B.S. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 579-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the Drosophila SR splicing proteins (17Yeakley J.M. Mortin J.P. Rosenfeld M.G. Fu X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7582-7587Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We report here that the RNA binding activity and specificity of Fmrp is an intrinsic property of the protein. The purified FLAG-Fmrp binds in a salt-resistant manner to ribonucleic homopolymers with a high affinity for poly(G) and poly(U) but with weak affinity for poly(C) and poly(A). Purified Fmrp also binds specifically to the 3′-untranslated region of its own message and a subset of human brain transcripts. In addition, an isoform 4 of Fmrp, lacking RGG boxes, was shown to only weakly bind RNA, whereas the I304N mutation of the second KH domain was found to retain RNA binding ability. These studies show that purified recombinant Fmrp is suitable for further biochemical and structural studies and will be a useful reagent to identify cognate mRNAs. Baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 and Sf9 cells were obtained from Invitrogen Corp. BaculoGold wild type baculovirus was purchased from Pharmingen, and Grace's medium, pluronic F-68, and antibiotic/antimycotic were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.

The baculoviral constructs used in wild type Fmrp production were constructed by inserting the sequence GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG encoding the FLAG epitope into full-lengthfmr1 cDNA between the second and third amino acids. Thefmr1 Mc2.17 cDNA (18Ashley C.T. Sutcliffe J.S. Kunst C.B. Leiner H.A. Eithler E.E. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Nat.

Briefly, polymerase chain reaction was performed using an upstream primer (5′ACCTCCCGGAGGATGGAGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGAGC TGGTGGTGGAAGTGC-3′) containing at its 5′-terminus anEcoN1 restriction site (underlined), a methionine and glutamate codon followed by sequence encoding the FLAG epitope, and a downstream primer (5′-ATGAAATCTTGAGGCAAGCTGCC-3′). The fragment was digested with EcoN1 and BstB1. The purified oligo was then cloned into Mc2.17 in pBS KS+ previously restricted withEcoN1 and BstB1, deleting the endogenous sequence between the 5′ EcoN1 site and the initiating ATG offmr1. The cloning junctions were sequenced to verify the correct protein reading frame. For the I304N point mutant Fmrp construct, a SacII/SnaBI fragment carrying the FLAG epitope was removed from the wild type cDNA and ligated into the Mc2.17 point mutant cDNA that was previously restricted withSacII and SnaBI and that carried the A to T missense at nucleotide 1034 (19De Boulle K.

For the wild type and I304N constructs, a 3.9-kb EcoRI fragment containing the full, tagged cDNA without the 3′-terminal 256 bases of the 3′-UTR was cloned into the nonfusion baculovirus pVL1393 vector downstream of the AcMNPV enhancer-promoter. These constructs were co-transformed into Sf9 cells with BaculoGold AcMNPV DNA using a cationic liposome method as recommended (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells were cultured in 1× Grace's medium with 10% FBS, 0.1% pluronic F-68, and 1 × antibiotic/antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). Occlusion body-negative recombinant plaques on an Sf9 cell lawn were visually identified, isolated, and purified by screening crude cell lysates for recombinant protein production via Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 and/or anti-Fmrp primary antibody. Viral DNA was extracted from high titer stocks and sequenced to confirm the amino acid codon at position 304. For isoform 4 Fmrp production, the coding region of Mc2.14 (18Ashley C.T. Sutcliffe J.S. Kunst C.B. Leiner H.A. Eithler E.E. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Nat.

The fragment was subsequently ligated in frame to theSacI/SalI digested vector pQE31 (Qiagen). This construct places the His6 tag 5′ to the polylinker. The pQE expression construct was then transformed into the M15[pREP4]E. coli host strain (Qiagen), which carries the pPREP4 repressor plasmid. Transformants were selected on plates containing both ampicillin and kanamycin and were screened for the insert. In Sf9 cells, virus was amplified to high titer by serial infections with plaque-purified, protein-producing virus as recommended (Invitrogen). Large scale purification of recombinant protein was performed as follows: 4 × 108 cells were infected with high titer virus for 72 h at a multiplicity of infection = 5 in spinning culture. Cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS, pH 7.2–7.4, containing 1m NaCl and protease inhibitors: 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 10 mm N-ethylameleimide, 2 mm iodoacetamide and diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation for 10 min at 450 psi and subjected to centrifugation at 14,500 × g for 20 min, followed by shearing the supernatant through an 18-gauge needle before centrifugation at 60,000 × g for 1 h. Soluble protein was loaded onto an anti-FLAG M2 affinity column, washed with 1 × PBS, 1 m NaCl, protease inhibitors, and eluted with 150 μg/ml FLAG peptide. Fractions were analyzed via Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel, Western blotting, and Bradford protein concentration assay (Bio-Rad). Fractions containing FLAG-Fmrp were dialyzed against 1× PBS, 0.75 m NaCl, 10% glycerol for 2 h; against 1× PBS, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol for 2 h; and against 1× PBS, 0.3 m NaCl, 10% glycerol overnight. Buffer to sample ratio was 1000:1 for each dialysis. Briefly, bacteria containing the His6 isoform 4 construct were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin until the A 600 reached 0.8. We used carbenicillin, a less labile, semisynthetic form of ampicillin, for selection to ensure plasmid maintenance (QIAexpressionist, Qiagen). Recombinant protein production was then induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 2 mm for 5 h, and the cells were harvested at 4000 × g for 10 min. For purification, the cells were lysed for 1 h in Buffer A (6 m GuHCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to a Ni-NTA column that was previously equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) followed by 5 column volumes of Buffer C (8 m urea, 0.1m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.3) until the A 280 was less than 0.01. Recombinant His6 isoform 4 Fmrp was eluted with 18 ml of Buffer D (8m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 5.9), followed by 18 ml of Buffer E (8m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 4.5). 3-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purified His6 isoform 4 Fmrp was refolded using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and β-cyclodextrin while simultaneously removing the urea as described by Rozema and Gellman (20Rozema D. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 2373-2374Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Protein was first slowly dialyzed from 8 m urea down to 3 m urea and then, at a concentration of 1.6 μg/ul, was refolded by the addition of 50 mm CTAB to a final concentration of 2.28 mm. Dialysis was then performed against 23 mm Tris, 2.28 mm CTAB for 2 h at 4 °C. Next, 2.5 ml of 16 mm β-cyclodextrin was added, and the resulting solution was allowed to stand overnight at 4 °C. The protein was then concentrated with aM r 10,000 cutoff filter, simultaneously changing the buffer to 1× PBS pH 7.4 (Ultrafree-15 Centrifugal Filter Device Biomax-10K NMWL membrane from Millipore, catalog no. UFV2BGC10). Assays were performed according to previously established procedures (15Siomi H. Choi M. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1994; 77: 33-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 21Swanson M.S. Greyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, homopolymer RNA was conjugated to CNBr-activated beads previously washed with 1 mm HCl and then conjugated with RNA either in carbonate buffer, pH 8.0, for primary amine linkage (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; as recommended), MES buffer, pH 6.0, for aromatic amine linkage (22Wagner A.F. Bugianesi R.L. Shen T.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), or potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, for 5′ phosphate linkage (23Poonian M.S. Schlaback A.J. Weissback A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), 8–72 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with three volumes of conjugation buffer and then twice with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and blocked for at least 4 h in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After blocking, the beads were washed in alternating high/low pH buffers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; as recommended), and conjugation efficiency was determined via alkaline hydrolysis of an aliquot overnight at room temperature. The amount of nucleic acids released was determined by measuring absorbance at 258 nm. Samples of identically prepared, mock conjugated naked beads were alkaline hydrolyzed and analyzed to exclude background absorbance. The absorbance values and extinction coefficients were used to equalize input of immobilized homopolymer RNA for each binding reaction. Experiments shown were performed with beads prepared in the carbonate buffers. Indicated amounts of FLAG-Fmrp and approximately 5 μg of homopolymer RNA beads were at 30 °C in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 2.5% Triton X-100) or the buffer indicated. After incubation, the beads were washed 5 times for 10 min each at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of binding buffer. The second wash contained 1 mg/ml heparin. Beads were pelleted at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 20 min, and pelleted. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and pelleted, and 50% of the volume was loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE minigel for electrophoresis (Bio-Rad). This procedure was used to equalize the amount loaded for each reaction and to avoid loading agarose matrix onto the gel. Fmrp eluted from the beads was detected by Western blotting using enhanced chemiluminesence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length (4.2 kb)fmr1 message containing all 17 exons was transcribed and32P-labeled in vitro with T3 polymerase (Stratagene) using 44 μCi of 32P-UTP. One microgram of 4.2-kb Mc2.17 sequence (19De Boulle K. Verkerk A.J. Reyniers E. Vits L. Hendricks J. Van Roy B. Van den Bos F. de Graaff E. Oostra B.A. Willems P.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) in pBS SK+ vector restricted withXhoI served as template. Fmr1 message (500 ng, ∼4.7 × 106 counts) was mixed with protein in 30-μl reactions in 1× ERBB binding buffer. The mix was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and uv cross-linked on ice 11 times for 30 s (120 mJ) each (24Kessler M.M. Henry M.F. Shen E. Zhao J. Gross S. Silver P.A. Moore C.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2545-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). RNase A (Sigma) was added, and the mix was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. SDS sample buffer was added, and the sample was boiled for 3–5 min and then loaded on 7.5% SDS-PAGE minigels (Bio-Rad). Gels were silver-stained, and autoradiography was performed overnight. Recombinant Fmrp and32P-labeled full-length fmr1 message as described above were mixed in 50-μl reaction volumes of 1× ERBB buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. Nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, HAWP 025 00) were pretreated with 0.4 m potassium hydroxide for 40 min, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0–7.9, for 30 min, and binding buffer for 5 min prior to use. The reaction mix was filtered (∼10 s), and the filters were washed with 2.5 ml of IPP150 (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% NaN3) (25Sherly D. Boelens W. van Venrooij W.J. Dathan N.A. Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4163-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Specific activity for thefmr1 probe was 1.5 × 104 counts/fmol (see Fig. 5 A) and 7.28 × 103 counts/fmol (see Fig. 5 C). Filters were dried, and the nucleic acids retained on the filter were dried and quantitated via scintillation counting (Beckman). Fmr1 cDNA (Mc2.17 cloned into pBS KS+)18 message containing all 17 exons was linearized with either XhoI (+3′-UTR) orNsiI (−3′-UTR) and then transcribed, as described above, and biotinylated in vitro (6Ashley Jr., C.A. Wilkinson K.D. Reines D. Warren S.T. Science. 1993; 262: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). For human brain transcript assays, plasmid DNA from each randomly chosen clone in a pCMV-SPORTTM human brain cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) was linearized by NotI restriction, transcribed, and biotinylated in vitro using Sp6 polymerase (Stratagene). Each message (80 ng) was mixed with 250 ng of FLAG-Fmrp in 1× ERBB buffer and incubated in a 10-μl reaction volume at 30 °C for 30 min. The RNA was captured with streptavidin-linked magnetic beads (Dynal) and washed three times for 10 min each with 0.7 ml of IPP150 buffer at room temperature. Protein was eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-sample buffer, and visualized via SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Alternatively, the messages were mixed with 2 μl of TnTR transcription/translation mix (Promega) containing either 35S-labeled wild type Fmrp or35S-labeled isoform 4 Fmrp. Neither of the35S-labeled proteins had the FLAG epitope. Reactions were performed as above, and the protein was eluted by boiling the beads in protein sample buffer, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, visualized via phosphorimage, and quantitated by MacBas, version 2.0, software. The mouse cDNA Mc2.17 encodes the Fmrp with 97% amino acid identity and greater than 98% predicted amino acid similarity to human FMRP (18Ashley C.T. Sutcliffe J.S. Kunst C.B. Leiner H.A. Eithler E.E. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We have inserted an eight-amino acid FLAG peptide epitope tag between the second and third amino acids of Fmrp and cloned the full-length construct into the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector. Cotransfecting Sf9 insect cells with pVL1393-FLAG-fmr1 and linear BaculoGold DNA yielded recombinant baculovirus expressing FLAG-Fmrp using its natural ATG start codon controlled by the polyhedrin promoter. Cell lysates analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels stained for protein show that cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus produce an extra ∼85-kDa protein band (Fig. 1, A andC). Western analysis using the anti-FLAG M2 primary antibody detected the FLAG-tagged protein in infected cell lysates only, and showed no cross-reactivity to insect proteins (Fig. 1 B). Western analysis using monoclonal anti-Fmrp primary antibody detects the same protein band, with no cross-reactivity to insect cell proteins, confirming its identity as FLAG-Fmrp (data not shown). Similar to Fmrp-translated in vitro and endogenous full-length FMRP in human lymphoblastoid cells, the recombinant protein migrates with an anomalously high apparent molecular weight, larger than predicted from primary amino acid sequence (26Small K. Warren S.T. Mental Retard. Dev. Disabil. Res. Rev. 1995; 1: 245-250Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). After lysing the cells, FLAG-Fmrp was purified by affinity chromatography using anti-FLAG M2 antibody matrix and analyzed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 1, C and B, respectively). One hundred ml of Sf9 cell suspension culture at 1 × 106 to 3 × 106 cells per ml produced approximately 1 mg of purified FLAG-Fmrp protein. We next asked whether the purified recombinant Fmrp displayed the biochemical properties previously observed for Fmrp that had been translated and assayed within wheat germ extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate (5Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1993; 74: 291-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 15Siomi H. Choi M. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1994; 77: 33-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The importance of this question may not be intuitive; our first assumption was that if the protein had not become denatured during purification, then it would behave identically to the unpurified in vitro-translated Fmrp. However, upon careful examination of previous work and considering that Fmrp is one component of multiprotein mRNPs or translation machinery, we could not be certain that Fmrp was the component of the translation lysate that directly bound the mRNA (11Khandjian E.W. Corbin F. Woerly S. Rousseau F. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12Tamanini F. Meijer N. Verheij C. Willems P.J. Galjaard H. Oostra B.A. Hoogeveen A.T. Hum.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We performed RNA binding assays with the purified protein, using homopolymer RNAs conjugated to Sepharose beads (21Swanson M.S. Greyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The purified FLAG-Fmrp preferentially bound poly(G) much stronger than poly(U) and barely bound poly(C) or poly(A). This specificity is identical to that previously observed with in vitro-translated Fmrp (5Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1993; 74: 291-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). To further assess the binding specificity, we performed competition assays with ribonucleotide homopolymers. Because preliminary evidence showed that Fmrp to has a slow on-rate, requiring at least 10 min for complete binding (data not shown), we premixed Fmrp with free competitor poly(G) or poly(U) for 15 min and then added poly(G)-beads to the binding reaction and incubated 20–25 min. The G-beads were washed, and the yield of captured Fmrp was analyzed (Fig. 2 B). Poly(G) competed effectively with agarose-conjugated poly(G); an equivalent molar amount of competitor poly(G) reduced the amount of Fmrp captured by at least 50%, whereas a 50-fold molar excess of free poly(G) completely eliminated agarose-conjugated poly(G) from binding to Fmrp. As expected from the poor binding of agarose-conjugated poly(U) to Fmrp, free poly(U) was ineffective in competing with agarose-conjugated poly(G) for Fmrp binding. Conjugation by either a primary amine linkage or an aromatic amine linkage, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” did not change these results (data not shown). To further characterize the interaction of Fmrp with poly(G), a battery of binding conditions were assayed (Fig. 3). The purified Fmrp bound poly(G) homopolymer beads with a salt sensitivity identical to that reported for Fmrp translated in cell lysates in that binding is abrogated when the binding buffer contains 50"
https://openalex.org/W2046821826,"Chlorophyll breakdown in green plants is a long-standing biological enigma. Recent work has shown that pheophorbide a (Pheide a) derived from chlorophyll (Chl) is converted oxygenolytically into a primary fluorescent catabolite (pFCC-1) via a red Chl catabolite (RCC) intermediate. RCC, the product of the ring cleavage reaction catalyzed by Pheide a oxygenase, which is suggested to be the key enzyme in Chl breakdown in green plants, is converted into pFCC-1 by a reductase. In the present study, an in vitroassay comprising 18O2 Pheide aoxygenase and RCC reductase yielded labeled pFCC-1. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometric analysis of the purified pFCC-1 product revealed that only one of the two oxygen atoms newly introduced into Pheide a in the course of the cleavage reaction is derived from molecular oxygen. Analysis of the fragment ions located the oxygen atom derived from molecular oxygen on the formyl group of pyrrole B. This finding demonstrates that the cleavage of Pheide a in vascular plants is catalyzed by a monooxygenase. Chlorophyll breakdown is therefore indicated to be mechanistically related in higher plants and in the green alga Chlorella protothecoides."
https://openalex.org/W1982690891,"Arrestin plays an important role in quenching phototransduction via its ability to bind to the phosphorylated light-activated form of the visual receptor rhodopsin (P-Rh*). Remarkable selectivity of visual arrestin toward this functional form is determined by an elegant sequential multisite binding mechanism. Previous structure-function studies have suggested that the COOH-terminal region of arrestin (residues 356–404) is not directly involved in rhodopsin interaction, but instead plays a regulatory role. This region supports basal arrestin conformation and ensures arrestin's transition into a high affinity rhodopsin-binding state upon an encounter with P-Rh*. Overall, our results corroborate this hypothesis and identify three functional subregions (residues 361–368, 369–378, and 379–404) and individual amino acids involved in the control of arrestin stability and binding selectivity. Two of the most potent mutants, arrestin(1–378) and arrestin(F375A,V376A,F377A) belong to a novel class of constitutively active arrestins with high affinity for P-Rh*, dark P-Rh, and Rh* (but not dark Rh), in contrast to earlier constructed mutants arrestin(R175E) and arrestin(Δ2–16) with high affinity for light-activated forms only. The implications of these findings for the mechanism of arrestin-rhodopsin interaction are discussed in light of the recently determined crystal structure of arrestin.

The visual amplification cascade has long served as a model for G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Light-activated rhodopsin (Rh*) 1The abbreviations used are: Rh*, light-activated rhodopsin; Rh, dark rhodopsin; arr, visual arrestin; G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; P-Rh, phosphorylated rhodopsin; P-Rh*, phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: Rh*, light-activated rhodopsin; Rh, dark rhodopsin; arr, visual arrestin; G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; P-Rh, phosphorylated rhodopsin; P-Rh*, phosphorylated light-activated rhodopsin; bp, base pair(s). activates visual G protein transducin, which in turn stimulates cGMP phosphodiesterase. The reduction in intracellular cGMP leads to the closing of cGMP-gated sodium channels and hyperpolarization of the rod cell. Quenching of the visual signaling is initiated by rapid phosphorylation of Rh* by rhodopsin kinase, followed by highly selective binding of arrestin to P-Rh* (1Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl.

Wilden U. Choe H.-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal half of arrestin contains anactivation-recognition site that interacts with the regions of rhodopsin that change conformation upon light activation, and aphosphorylation-recognition site that interacts with the phosphorylated COOH terminus of rhodopsin (Fig. 1) (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two regions serve as the primary binding sites. When arrestin encounters P-Rh*, it undergoes a conformational rearrangement (9Schleicher A. Kuhn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1170-1175Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar) that results in mobilization of a secondary binding site (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

According to the model of sequential multisite binding (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this transition is triggered by simultaneous engagement of both primary sites. We hypothesized that the transition is controlled by constraining intramolecular interactions within arrestin (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Some of these constraints are disrupted as the result of arrestin binding to phosphates on phosphorhodopsin, while others are released upon arrestin binding to that part of rhodopsin, which changes conformation upon activation. When both constraints are simultaneously relieved, arrestin assumes its high affinity rhodopsin-binding conformation. Two constraining interactions have been tentatively identified, one between the basic NH2 terminus and the acidic COOH terminus (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Unfortunately, x-ray crystallography did not reveal any structure of the COOH terminus beyond residue 368. In this study we identify specific residues in the COOH terminus that control the selectivity of arrestin binding. [γ-32P]ATP and [3H]leucine were purchased from NEN Life Science Products.

This pGEM2-based plasmid encodes bovine wild type arrestin with an “idealized” 5′-untranslated region (13Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) under control of SP6 promoter. Plasmid pARR-VSP was modified by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis, as follows. Oligonucleotides 5′-gtc atg ggg ata cta gtg tct tac cag-3′ (codons 320–328) (IV) and 5′-t cgc cac ttc act gga tgtcag ctc tcc cag aag tcc tga cac cg-3′ (anticodons 349–334) were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively, to generate an 88 bp fragment. Oligonucleotide 5′-gag gcc tcc tgg cag ttc ttc at-3′ (codons 191–198) (I) and the 88 bp fragment were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively, to generate a 473-bp fragment. Oligonucleotides 5′-aat ttt gtt ttcgaa gag ttc gcggaagg caa aat ctg aaa g-3′ (codons 374–387) and 5′-agcttaagcttgcggccgcg-3′ (antisense modified 3′-UTR) (II) were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively, to generate a 152-bp fragment. Oligonucleotide 5′-ca tcc agt gaa gtg gcg act gag gtg c-3′ (codons 343–352) (III) and the 152-bp fragment were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively, to generate a 244 bp fragment. The 473- and 244-bp fragments (which have an 18-bp overlap) were used without template to generate a 700-bp “primer-dimer,” which was subsequently reamplified using oligonucleotides I and II, purified, digested with XhoI and NotI, and subcloned into XhoI/NotI-digested pARR-VSP. In the resulting construct (pARR-SC), which was used for all further mutagenesis, several silent mutations were introduced (underlined bases in oligonucleotides) into the visual arrestin open reading frame, creating unique restriction sites SpeI (codons 323–325),BstBI (codons 377–378), NruI (codons 380–382), and eliminating sites BamHI (codons 322–324),StuI (codons 336–338), SacI (codons 341–342), and BalI (codons 347–349). All mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate mutagenizing oligonucleotide and oligonucleotide II as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and the 244-bp fragment as a template. Oligonucleotide IV and resulting fragments of various lengths were then used as forward and reverse primers, respectively, with the 700-bp fragment as a template to generate 314-bp fragments with corresponding mutations. These fragments were purified, digested withNsiI/StyI (mutations in positions 361–364),StyI/NruI (369–379), orBstBI/HindIII (387–404), and subcloned into appropriately digested pARR-SC. Double mutants were constructed by excising appropriate NruI/NotI fragment and subcloning it into NruI/NotI digested plasmid encoding arrestin(E379Q). Cluster mutants were constructed similarly, subcloning polymerase chain reaction-generated mutantStyI/NruI or BstBI/HindIII fragments into appropriately digested pARR-SC. The sequences of polymerase chain reaction-generated portions of all constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Plasmids were linearized with HindIII,NruI, BstBI, or StyI before in vitro transcription, to produce mRNAs encoding full-length, truncated (1–380), (1–376), or (1–367) arrestin proteins. In vitro transcription and translation were performed as described previously (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All arrestin proteins were labeled by incorporation of [3H]leucine with specific activity 20–40 Ci/mmol, resulting in the specific activities of 200–300 Ci/mmol (440–660 dpm/fmol). The translation of each of the arrestin mutants used in this study produced a single labeled protein band with the expected mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two parameters were used for the assessment of mutant stability. First, protein yields in thein vitro translation are known to correlate with stability, most likely because misfolded or denatured proteins are rapidly destroyed by proteases present in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (13Gurevich V.V. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Second, denatured proteins tend to aggregate and are pelleted by centrifugation at 350,000 × g for 1 h. As an estimate of a mutant's relative stability we used its yield multiplied by the percentage of protein remaining in the supernatant after incubation for 10 min at 37 °C followed by centrifugation. This integral parameter calculated for a mutant was expressed as a percent of that for wild type arrestin. Urea-treated rod outer segment membranes were prepared, phosphorylated with rhodopsin kinase, and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal as described elsewhere (12Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7058-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of phosphorylation for the rhodopsin preparations used in these studies was 1.2–1.6 mol of phosphate/mol of rhodopsin. In vitrotranslated tritiated arrestins (100 fmol) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm potassium acetate with 7.5 pmol of the various functional forms of rhodopsin in a final volume of 50 μl for 5 min at 37 °C either in the dark or in room light (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were immediately cooled on ice and loaded under dim red light onto 2 ml of Sepharose 2B columns equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA. Bound arrestin eluted with the rod outer segments in the void volume (between 0.5 and 1.1 ml). Nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 0.3 μg of liposomes (<10% of the total binding and <0.5% of the arrestin present in the assay) was subtracted. The removal of 37 COOH-terminal amino acids (Figs. 1 and 2) substantially reduces the stability of arrestin and its selectivity toward P-Rh* (4Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To localize more precisely the residues involved we utilized restriction sites NruI and BstBI to produce truncated mRNAs encoding arrestin(1–380) and (1–376). These mutants were expressed by in vitro translation and compared with full-length arrestin and arrestin(1–367) (Fig. 2). Arrestin(1–380) demonstrates a 20% decrease in P-Rh* binding and a 4-fold increase in binding to dark P-Rh and Rh*. The binding of arrestin(1–376) to both dark P-Rh and Rh* is twice that of arrestin(1–380), while its binding to P-Rh* is virtually the same. The deletion of 9 additional residues in (1–367) slightly reduces the binding without further change in selectivity (Fig. 2). The absolute binding of any mutant reflects both its affinity for a particular form of rhodopsin and its stability under assay conditions, whereas its relative binding to different functional forms (selectivity profile) is not affected by its stability. To interpret the effects of mutations on absolute binding levels, we used an independent assessment of stability. We found that truncations (1–380), (1–376), and (1–367) reduce stability to 17, 14, and 10% of that for full-length arrestin. Thus, it appears that multiple residues within the COOH-terminal domain are critical for arrestin stability and selectivity. Several lines of evidence suggest functional importance of negatively charged residues in the COOH terminus of visual arrestin (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gurevich V.V. Chen C.-Y. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we first introduced Glu → Gln and Asp → Asn mutations, and compared these mutants with wild type arrestin and a phosphorylation-independent mutant arrestin(R175E) (10Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Point mutants clearly fall into three distinct groups. Mutations in the subregion I (361–368) (E361Q, D362N, D364N, and E368Q) result in a moderate general decrease of arrestin binding. Thus, the subregion 361–368 appears to be more involved in supporting arrestin stability than in selectivity control. The most potent of these mutations (E368Q) reduces the stability by 35%. Mutations in the subregion II (372–378) (D372N, E373Q, and E378Q) reduce arrestin binding to P-Rh* and moderately increase its binding to both dark forms of rhodopsin (Fig. 3). Reversal of all three negative charges (arr-3R = D372R, E373R, and E378R) results in less than a 2-fold increase in dark P-Rh binding, as well as a 3-fold increase in binding to Rh* (Fig. 4), without affecting P-Rh* and dark Rh interaction. Neither of these mutations affects arrestin stability. Neutralization of negative charges in subregion III (379–404) (E379Q, D387N, E390Q, E393Q, E394Q, D397N, E399Q, D403N, and E404Q) increases arrestin binding to all functional forms of rhodopsin, especially to dark P-Rh and Rh* (Fig. 3). The most potent mutations in this group are E379Q, D387N, and E393Q. The effect of each mutation on Rh* and dark P-Rh binding is rather moderate (less than 2-fold), unlike the dramatic 10–15-fold increase in Rh* binding due to R175E mutation (Fig. 5). On the other hand, elimination of 7 (out of 9) negative charges within this 24-residue subregion stimulates binding. Conceivably these residues function in concert, interacting with multiple positively charged partners. Alternatively, some of them might be involved in the interaction with Arg-175 (the lack of information on three-dimensional structure of arrestin COOH terminus (8Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) does not allow us to exclude this possibility). If the first scenario is correct, we expected that: 1) double mutations would have a slightly stronger effect than either single mutation alone, and 2) the effect of charge reversal would not be substantially greater than charge neutralization. If these residues interact with Arg-175, double mutations and/or charge reversal may result in a dramatic change in arrestin selectivity. To test these possibilities, we constructed four double mutants, each combining E379Q with another stimulatory mutation (D387N, E393Q, E394Q, or D397N) and seven mutants with charge reversal (E379R, D387R, E393R, E394R, D397R, E399R, and D403R) (Fig. 4). The second mutation in each case enhances the effect of E379Q, especially on Rh* binding, but neither combination causes a change comparable to that of R175E. The effects of charge reversal are essentially the same as those of neutralization. Apparently, negatively charged residues in this subregion do not interact with Arg-175. Subregion 379–404 likely interacts with multiple positive charges elsewhere. To further test this hypothesis, we constructed additional mutants: arrestin(1–378), in which the whole subregion 379–404 is deleted; arr-4R (D387R, E390R, E393R, and E394R); arr-5R (E379R, D387R, E390R, E393R, and E394R) with multiple charge reversals; arr-4R(1–394); and arr-5R(1–394), in which charge reversals are combined with the truncation of the remainder of the subregion III. Arrestin(1–378) demonstrates an increased binding to all forms of rhodopsin, which is most dramatic (more than 15-fold) for dark P-Rh and Rh* (Fig. 5). Arrestin(1–378) stability (80% of full-length) is substantially better than that of arrestin(1–376) or (1–380). The reversal of 4 charges with or without the truncation produces a 2–3-fold increase in dark P-Rh and Rh* binding, and a 30–40% decrease in P-Rh* binding. The reversal of 5 charges causes an 80% decrease (Fig. 5). 4R and 5R mutations decrease arrestin stability to 44 and 25%, respectively, of that of wild type, and the deletion of residues 395–404 further decreases it to 15 and 11%. The difference between selectivity profiles of arr-4R and arr-5R (which has a single additional mutation E379R) is striking (Fig. 5), while the effect of this mutation in wild type arrestin is moderate (Fig. 4). This finding suggests that multiple negatively charged residues function in concert, and an individual mutation has a profound effect only when it is “the last straw.” Similarly, the deletion of residues 395–404 in the context of arr-4R has virtually no effect on binding selectivity, whereas the effect of the same deletion in arr-5R is more significant (Fig. 5). Interestingly, dark P-Rh:P-Rh*:Rh* binding ratios of arr-5R(1–394) and arrestin(1–378) are similar (roughly 1:3:2). In addition to negative charges, other COOH-terminal elements are well conserved among the members of arrestin family (Fig. 1), including a cluster of three bulky hydrophobic residues FVF (375–377), the hydrophobic Phe-380, and the positively charged Arg-382. Properties of a mutant with triple alanine substitution arr-3A (F375A,V376A,F377A) were found to be similar to those of the arrestin(1–378); the binding to dark P-Rh, dark Rh, and Rh* was increased 22-, 9-, and 10-fold, respectively, and the binding to P-Rh* was substantially increased (Fig. 5). The effects of individual mutations in this cluster are similar, although less dramatic, suggesting that these residues act in concert. The effects of F380A and R382N mutations resemble those of F375A and F377A (Fig. 5). Neither mutation affects stability. Interestingly, the combined 3A + 3R mutation is comparable in all respects to the 3A mutation (Fig. 5), suggesting that the entire 372–378 element acts as a functional unit, with Phe-375 and Phe-377 playing a major role. Two different mechanisms may be responsible for higher binding to dark P-Rh and Rh*, either an increase in affinity of the corresponding primary binding site (phosphorylation- and activation-recognition, respectively), and/or the mobilization of the secondary site for the interaction with these forms of rhodopsin (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reduced sensitivity of the binding to high salt inhibition is indicative of the involvement of the hydrophobic secondary site (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We tested salt sensitivity of Rh* and dark P-Rh binding of those mutants exhibiting the most profound selectivity changes (Fig. 6). The binding of wild type arrestin to Rh* is inhibited by salt with IC50 of 170 mm, whereas its binding to P-Rh* (with the secondary site fully mobilized) is less sensitive (IC50 about 700 mm). All mutants with Rh* are less sensitive to salt inhibition than is wild type arrestin (Fig. 6), suggesting that these mutations result in the mobilization of the secondary site for Rh* binding to various degrees (arr-3A > arr-4R > arr(1–378) = arr(E379R)). Mutant arrestin interactions with dark P-Rh exhibit smaller differences in salt sensitivity (not shown). The COOH-terminal region of visual arrestin plays an important role in supporting basal arrestin conformation and ensuring its strict selectivity toward P-Rh*. However, a mutation that relieves any conformational constraint in the arrestin molecule can be reasonably expected to affect both stability and selectivity. The association of increased conformational flexibility with constitutive activity of a protein appears to be a general phenomenon. A recent study (31Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2587-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that a constitutively active mutant of β2-adrenergic receptor is less stable than wild type protein. This constitutively active mutant was also found to undergo the conformational change upon activation by an agonist more readily,i.e. higher percentage of receptor appears to be in an “active” state under the same conditions. This finding parallels the substantially higher binding of constitutively active arrestins to P-Rh* determined in our experiments (Fig. 5). To simplify the interpretation of the data, we assume that mutations, which result in less than 20% change in protein stability accompanied by a dramatic 10–20-fold increase in dark P-Rh and/or Rh* binding, primarily disrupt selectivity control. More profound decreases in stability suggest that the mutated element supports structural integrity of the molecule, while concomitant changes in binding selectivity may be either the direct result of the mutation or a secondary effect of a “loose” conformation. Elements involved in supporting arrestin stability appear to be distributed throughout COOH-terminal region. These include at least 9 negatively charged residues (4 in subregion I and 5 in subregion III), and residues 395–404. The effects of point mutations are weak, whereas multiple mutations produce substantial changes. Thus, groups of these residues appear to work together, conceivably via zipper-like interactions with clusters of positively charged residues. Mutagenesis studies (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gurevich V.V. Chen C.-Y. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that interaction with the arrestin NH2 terminus is most likely involved. Although the recently published arrestin crystal structure (8Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) does not extend beyond residue 368, the positioning of the beginning of the COOH-terminal region and of the NH2-terminal region (β-strands A and B in Granzin et al. (8Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)) supports this hypothesis. Point mutations in the arrestin COOH terminus do not dramatically reduce selectivity (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, structural elements encompassing several residues appear to be involved in selectivity control. The most profound changes in arrestin selectivity are brought about by alanine substitution of FVF cluster (375–377), and by the deletion of the 379–404 region. Binding characteristics of arr-3A and arr(1–378) are similar, although not identical (Figs. 5 and 6). The proximity of these two elements suggests that they may interact with a common partner which has both a hydrophobic cluster and a series of positive charges. Alternatively, these elements may participate in two independent constraining interactions. Our data suggest that the disruption of either interaction is sufficient to promote high binding to dark P-Rh and Rh*, apparently via the mobilization of a secondary hydrophobic binding site (Fig. 6). Superimposition of arrestin crystal structure and cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin (8Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) leaves a substantial part of the latter open for putative interaction with the secondary binding site of arrestin. The arrestin molecule consists of two domains connected by an extended hinge region (residues 180–192), with both domains having domelike concave surfaces (8Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the secondary binding site is localized on such a surface of COOH-terminal domain. Then the conformational rearrangement of the arrestin molecule upon P-Rh* binding (9Schleicher A. Kuhn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1170-1175Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the mobilization of the secondary binding site (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can both be identified with the movement of COOH-terminal domain toward exposed elements of rhodopsin. Subregion I (361–368) appears to support the stability of arrestin. Glu-368 is the most important residue in subregion I (Fig. 3). The significantly lower stability of arr(1–355) compared with that of arr(1–367) (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that this stabilizing element likely extends further upstream. Subregions II and III are primarily involved in selectivity control (Fig. 5). Mutations in either subregion yield proteins with high binding to P-Rh*, dark P-Rh, and Rh*. These two subregions may either cooperate or function as two independent regulatory elements; however, both parts are necessary to ensure arrestin selectivity toward P-Rh*. Two lines of evidence suggest that subregion 379–404 is a separate structural element. First, limited proteolysis of purified recombinant arrestin with V8 endopeptidase removes this subregion (as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry). The remaining truncated arrestin effectively competes with 3H-labeled arrestin(R175E) for both P-Rh* and Rh*;i.e. it behaves exactly as does 3H-labeled arr(1–378). 2V. V. Gurevich and J. Hirsh, unpublished observations. Second, arr(1–378) is as stable as wild type protein, whereas the stability of both arr(1–376) and arr(1–380) is at least 5 times lower. Complete structural domains of proteins are often fairly stable, whereas parts of the domains, as well as proteins with partially deleted structural domains are not. The most logical interpretation of such a profound effect on stability upon removal or addition of just 2 amino acids appears to be that both mutations yield an incomplete structural element. Mutagenesis studies yielded at least four arrestin mutants with minimally perturbed stability and dramatically reduced selectivity: arr-3A, arr(1–378), arr(R175E), and arr(Δ2–16). The mutants fall into two distinct categories: 1) those exhibiting high binding to P-Rh*, dark P-Rh, and Rh* (arr-3A, arr(1–378)), and 2) those exhibiting high binding to only the light-activated forms of rhodopsin (arr(R175E), and arr(Δ2–16)). The model of sequential multisite binding predicts that there should be two types of constraining intramolecular interactions in arrestin that are disrupted upon arrestin binding to either phosphorylated or light-activated rhodopsin. Corresponding mutations yield proteins capable of phosphorylation-independent binding (mutants of the second group) or activation-independent binding (to P-Rh* and dark P-Rh only), respectively. A recent crystallographic study (8Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) identified 3 residues that interact with the phosphorylation-sensitive trigger Arg-175 (Asp-30, Asp-296, and Asp-303), and two salt bridges (Arg-80–Asp-82 and Glu-148–Arg-171) on the putative rhodopsin-binding surface of the NH2-terminal domain that may be involved in activation-recognition. However, in its simple form (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) the model does not provide an adequate mechanistic explanation of the binding characteristics of the first group of mutants. In order to accommodate these data, we propose the following refinement of the model. The first tier of constraining interactions involves trigger residues that are elements of the primary binding sites (e.g. Arg-175). These constraints are relieved when primary sites interact with corresponding parts of P-Rh*. We hypothesize that these events disrupt the second tier of constraining interactions, and this disruption brings about arrestin transition into high affinity rhodopsin-binding state. Mutations that directly disrupt these putative interactions of the second tier should override both activation- and phosphorylation-dependence of arrestin binding, thereby yielding proteins with high binding to P-Rh*, dark P-Rh, and Rh* (e.g. the first group of mutants). Conceivably, several residues in 379–404 region (Glu-379, Phe-380, Arg-382, Glu-390, Glu-393, Glu-394), as well as FVF cluster (375–377) in 369–378 region participate in the constraining interactions of the second tier. These two groups of interactions do not appear to be redundant, and both are necessary for arrestin selectivity. Interestingly, even the most promiscuous mutants such as arr(1–378) and arr-3A do not bind well to dark Rh, suggesting that in order to maintain its rhodopsin-binding state arrestin must be properly oriented via a strong engagement of at least one primary binding site. Visual arrestin has a strong potential for high affinity binding to unphosphorylated Rh*. It is possible that its evolutionary predecessor quenched signaling by unphosphorylated rhodopsin, as may be the case in the photoreceptors of invertebrates (15Byk T. Bar-Yaacov M. Doza Y.N. Minke B.

A splice variant of arrestin with a truncated COOH terminus is also expressed in vertebrate rods (p44) (24Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Ohguro H. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Kaplan M.W. Johnson R.S.

It was suggested that p44 may be relatively more important than arrestin in quenching (26Langlois G. Chen C.K. Palczewski K. Hurley J.B. Vuong T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Photoreceptors in transgenic mice expressing rhodopsin with a COOH-terminal truncation that eliminates rhodopsin kinase phosphorylation sites show grossly abnormal prolonged responses to stimulation by a single photon (27Chen J.

Science. 1995; 267: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), whereas rhodopsin truncationper se does not prevent tight binding of truncated arrestins (5Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

The deficit of functional rhodopsin kinase has been recently identified as the cause of several cases of Oguchi disease, a form of stationary night blindness (28Yamamoto S. Sippel K.C. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) with symptoms strikingly similar to those evoked by the lack of functional arrestin (29Fuchs S. Nakazawa M. Maw M.

Its actual role in photoreceptor cells remains to be elucidated. The failure of x-ray crystallography to resolve the structure of COOH-terminal region of arrestin (8Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.-W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) suggests that this part of the molecule may exist in several alternative conformations, which is consistent with its involvement in an elaborate mechanism of selectivity control.

Six synthetic peptides were prepared with sequences found either in the collagen triple helix or in the N- or C-telopeptides of collagen I. The four peptides with sequences found in the telopeptides were found to inhibit self-assembly of collagen I in a purified in vitro system. At concentrations of 2.5 mm, peptides with sequences in the C-telopeptides of the α1(I) and α2(I) chain inhibited assembly at about 95%. The addition of the peptide with the α2-telopeptide sequence was effective in inhibiting assembly if added during the lag phase and early propagation phase but not later in the assembly process. Experiments with biotinylated peptides indicated that both the N- and C-telopeptides bound to a region between amino acid 776 and 822 of the α(I) chain. A fragment of nine amino acids with sequences in the α2-telopeptide was effective in inhibiting fibril assembly. Mutating two aspartates in the 9-mer peptide to serine had no effect on inhibition of fibril assembly, but mutating two tyrosine residues and one phenylalanine residue abolished the inhibitory action. Molecular modeling of the binding sites demonstrated favorable hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between the α2telopeptide and residues 781–794 of the α(I) chain.

The most abundant collagen fibrils consist almost entirely of a single monomer of type I collagen. The structure of the monomer was established several decades ago, but the precise pattern of packing of the monomer into fibrils has not been defined and remains controversial (3Smith J.W.

A. 1989; 86: 4549-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Type I collagen is similar to other fibrillar collagen in that it is first synthesized as a soluble procollagen containing N-propeptides and C-propeptides (see Ref. 2Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). The propeptides are cleaved by specific N- and C-proteinases to generate the monomers that comprise collagen fibrils. The two α1(I) and one α2(I) chains of a monomer of type I collagen are primarily comprised of about 338 repeating tripeptide sequences of Gly-Xaa-Ybb in which Xaa is frequently proline and Ybb is frequently hydroxyproline. The ends of the α1(I) and one α2(I) chains consist of short telopeptides of about 11–26 amino acids per chain. The distribution of hydrophobic and charged resides in the Xaa and Ybb positions in the triple-helical domain define 4.4 repeats or 4.4 D periods of about 234 amino acids each. In longitudinal sections, the monomers are arranged in fibrils in a head-to-head-to-tail orientation with a gap of about 0.6 D periods and, therefore, repeat of 5 D periods. The continuity of the fibrils is maintained by many of the monomers being staggered by 1, 2, 3, or 4 D periods relative to the nearest neighbor so as to generate gap and overlap regions. However, there are conflicting data from electron microscopy and x-ray analysis about the lateral packing of the monomers. One view is that the monomers are laterally packed in a tilted quasi-hexagonal lattice (4Hulmes D.J.S. Miller A. Nature. 1979; 282: 878-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,14Jones E.Y. Miller A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A related view is that the fibrils consist of “compressed” microfibrils that are comprised of monomers coiled into a rope-like pentameric structure (3Smith J.W. Nature. 1968; 219: 157-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 6Piez K.A. Trus B.L. Biosci. Rep. 1981; 1: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Still another view is that the lateral packing of the collagen in many fibrils is either liquid-like or a biological equivalent of a liquid crystal (12Galloway J. Bairoti A. Garrone R. Biology of Invertebrate and Lower Vertebrate Collagens. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 73-82Crossref Google Scholar, 13Chapman J. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1367-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One experimental approach to defining the lateral packing of the monomers was to observe the initial assembly of monomers into fibrils. Early experiments (1Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 1-40Google Scholar, 11Ward N.P. Hulmes D.J.S. Chapman J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Veis A. Payne K. Nimni M.E. Collagen: Biochemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 113-138Google Scholar) on the reassembly of fibrils from collagen extracted from tissues with acidic buffers suggested that the first structures formed were linear strands of monomers bound by 0.4 D period overlaps (4 D staggers). Other observations with extracted collagens suggested the initial stages involved assembly of structures similar to pentameric microfibrils (1Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 1-40Google Scholar, 15Veis A. Payne K. Nimni M.E. Collagen: Biochemistry.

Subsequently, a system was developed for studying assembly of type I collagen fibrils de novo by enzymic cleavage of a purified soluble precursor of procollagen under physiological conditions (18Miyahara M. Njieha F.K. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8442-8448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kadler K.E. Hulmes D.J.S. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because thick fibrils were generated in the system at 30–32 °C, it was possible to use dark-field light microscopy to follow the growth of the fibrils through intermediate stages (21Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The first fibrils detected had a blunt end and a pointed end or tip. Initial growth of the fibrils was exclusively from the pointed or α tip. Later, β tips appeared on the blunt ends of the fibrils, and the fibrils grew from both directions. Scanning transmission electron microscopy indicated that both the α tips and β tips were near-paraboloidal in shape (22Holmes D.F. Chapman J.A. Prockop D.J. Kadler K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9855-9859Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Also, the monomers were oriented with their N termini directed toward the tips. Subsequent experiments in the same system with type II collagen suggested that the fibrils also grew from pointed tips. However, the monomers were oriented with a C termini directed toward the tips (23Fertala A. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. Sieron A.L. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14864-14869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Also, the fibrils contained central regions in which the monomers were packed symmetrically. Recent observations indicate there may be differences between collagen fibrils assembled in vitro and those assembled in vivo (24Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). In particular, collagen I fibrils assembled in vitro are exclusively bipolar, but fibrils from tissues are both bipolar and unipolar. Also, intermediates such as pNcollagen may participate in the initial steps of fibril assembly. All the data, however, are consistent with the conclusion that the fibrils grow from pointed tips. Three different models were proposed to explain the growth of fibrils from near-paraboloidal tips. One model (25Silver D. Miller J. Harrison R. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9860-9864Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was based on the assumption that the initial core of the fibril was a pentameric microfibril and that the fibril grew by the addition of monomers in a helical pattern. Simulations of the model suggested that as little as two specific binding steps were required, first for assembly of the microfibrillar core and then a structural nucleus with about the same diameter as the final fibril. After assembly of the structural nucleus, the fibril grew from the paraboloidal tip by the addition of monomers through only one of the two binding steps. A second and related model (26Hulmes D.J.S. Wess T.J. Prockop D.J. Fratzl P. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1661-1670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) suggested that assembly began with formation of an undefined inner core, and then monomers were added in spiral strands to generate the paraboloidal tips. The second model had the advantage that it more readily than the first model accounted for x-ray diffraction data that indicated that some fraction of monomers in fibrils were laterally packed in a tilted quasihexagonal lattice (4Hulmes D.J.S. Miller A. Nature. 1979; 282: 878-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14Jones E.Y. Miller A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast to the first two models, a third model (27Parkinson J. Kadler K.E. Brass A. Physical Rev. E. 1994; 50: 2963-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was developed in which monomers were assembled by a process involving only aggregated limited diffusion. The third model, therefore, assumed that the assembly of monomers into fibrils was similar to processes such as electrochemical depositions or perhaps formation of snowflakes and that the process did not require the presence of specific binding sites on the monomers. Here, we have developed a series of experiments on the assumption that the assembly of collagen I monomers into fibrils depends on the interactions of specific binding sites in different regions of the monomers. To test this assumption, we examined the effects of synthetic peptides on the assembly of fibrils de novo. The synthetic peptides were synthesized and purified by a commercial concern (American Peptide Company, Inc.). Homogeneity and stability of the peptides in experimental conditions were assayed by reverse-phase HPLC. 1The abbreviation used is: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. All the peptides were freely soluble in the fibril formation buffer. The pH of peptide solutions was monitored with a solid state micro-pH electrode (Beckman). Assembly of collagen I into fibrils de novo was assayed under conditions employed previously (18Miyahara M. Njieha F.K. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8442-8448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

In brief, 14C-labeled type I procollagen was recovered from the medium of cultured human skin fibroblasts and was purified with two chromatographic steps to homogeneity. The type I procollagen was processed to pCcollagen I by cleavage with procollagen N-proteinase purified from organ cultures of chick embryo tendons. The pCcollagen was then isolated on a gel filtration column. Fibril assembly was assayed in a 20-μl reaction volume in a 250-μl plastic centrifuge tube sealed with a plunger and containing a physiological bicarbonate buffer, 30 μg/ml pCcollagen I, and 15 units/ml procollagen C-proteinase purified from chick embryo tendons. Potentially inhibitory peptides were added to the reaction mixture to final concentrations of 0.5–2.5 mm in 5 μl of buffer. After incubation for 0.5 to 24 h at 37 °C, the sample was centrifuged 13,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet and supernatant fractions were separated by electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in SDS, and the gel was assayed either with a phosphor storage imager (STORM, Molecular Dynamics) or by staining with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Brilliant Blue; Sigma) and analysis with a densitometer (Personal Densitometer, Molecular Dynamics). Alternatively, the reaction was carried out in a sealed chamber on a microscopic slide and followed by dark-field light microscopy (Zeiss model 009). Type I collagen extracted with 0.5 m acetic acid from mouse skin was digested with pepsin, and the α chains were separated by gel electrophoresis in SDS. To generate CNBr peptides, gel slices containing α1(I) and α2(I) chains were placed into tubes, and α chains were digested with 10 mg/ml or 200 mg/ml CNBr in 70% formic acid at room temperature overnight. The gel slices were equilibrated with 0.05 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8) over 3 h. Gel pieces containing CNBr peptides derived from individual collagen α chains were transferred into the wells of the second gel prepared with a 6% polyacrylamide stacking gel and 12% polyacrylamide separating gel with 0.5 m urea. After electrophoresis, the gel was electroblotted overnight at 4 °C onto a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore). To study binding of telopeptides to collagen fragments, the method described by Fujisawa et al. (28Fujisawa R. Nodasaka Y. Kuboki Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 56: 140-144Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was used. The filters were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and then incubated overnight with 20 ml of 5 μg/ml peptide that was substituted at the N terminus with biotin (synthesized for us by American Peptide Company, Inc.). The filter was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween and incubated 30 min with a 1:30,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase conjugated with avidin (Sigma). The bands were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after exposure to an x-ray film for 3 to 10 min. To generate vertebrate collagenase fragments, 3 μg of type I pCcollagen from cultured human fibroblasts was cleaved with 10 μg/ml of vertebrate collagenase from cultured rat skin fibroblasts (generous gift from John J. Jeffrey, Department of Medicine, Albany Medical College) for 3 h at 25 °C in a volume of 40 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2 and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. To remove the C-propeptide, 2 μl of a mixture of trypsin (1 mg/ml) and chymotrypsin (2.5 mg/ml) in the same buffer was added, and the sample was incubated at 20 °C for 2 min. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The sample was then separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in SDS and processed with the same protocol as the CNBr fragments. To define the telopeptide binding site with a competitive assay, 96-well titration plates (Immulon 3, Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.) were used. Seventy microliters of the solution containing 3 μg of pepsin-treated monomeric collagen (Vitrogen 100, Collagen Biomaterials) in 0.01 n HCl was added to each well, and the plates were dried at room temperature. As a control, wells covered with bovine serum albumin were used. The plates were rinsed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. For the competition assay, pre-mixed samples were prepared that contained 50 μm biotinylated F2 or F3 peptide with 10–500 μm peptide α1-776/796. As a negative control, peptide α2-218/233 (F1) was used at concentrations from 10 to 500 μm. The peptide mixtures were added into wells containing immobilized collagen, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 12 h. The plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween. To detect biotinylated peptides bound to collagen surface, streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) was added at 1:20,000 dilution. After 2 h of incubation, the plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween, and the developing reagent 3 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.05 mNa2CO3, 0.05 mm MgCl2(pH 9.5) was added. After 2 h of incubation, the reaction was measured with microtiter plate reader (Dynatech Laboratories) using a 405-nm filter. Molecular modeling was performed on a Silicon Graphic (Indigo 2) computer system using the SYBYL software package, Version 6.3 (Tripos, Inc.) The model of the collagen I triple helix fragment including sequence from α1-766/801 and α2-766/801 was carried out as described by Chen et al.(29Chen J.M. Sheldon A. Pincus M.R. J. Biomol. Struct.

All the models were energy-minimized using a conjugate gradient method and subjected to repeating cycles of molecular dynamics using Kollman force field and united atoms (30Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh V.C. Ghio C. Alagone G. Profefa S. Weiner P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). To analyze interaction of F7 peptide with the collagen I binding region, intermolecular energy of interaction was analyzed to identify possible binding conformations. Surface calculations, lipophilicity potential, and electrostatic potential of the molecules were analyzed using SYBYL/Molcad module. Six synthetic peptides (Fig. 1) were prepared on the basis of two general considerations. (a) Extensive previous work (see Ref. 1Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 1-40Google Scholar) had demonstrated that the telopeptides were required to be present on the monomers to generate tightly packed fibrils, and (b) the self-assembly of collagen monomers is entropy-driven (see Ref. 19Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore, any specific binding sites in the triple helix are likely to be found in hydrophobic sequences. As indicated in Fig. 1, one peptide (F1) contained relatively hydrophobic sequences found near the end of the D1 period of the α2(I) chain, a second peptide (F5) had hydrophobic sequences found near the middle of the D4 period of the α2(I) chain. F6 contained sequences that spanned the vertebrate collagenase cleavage site of Gly-Ile in the D4 period of the α1(I) chain. The remaining three peptides had the sequences of the α1N-telopeptide, α1C-telopeptide, and α2C-telopeptide. Assays by reverse-phase HPLC demonstrated that none of the peptides were degraded under experimental conditions used here (data not shown). The peptides were added in concentrations of 2.5 mm to the system for assaying fibril formation by the cleavage of pCcollagen with C-proteinase (18Miyahara M. Njieha F.K. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

As indicated in Fig. 2 and TableI, the peptides F1 and F6 caused little if any inhibition of fibril assembly. Peptides F2, F3, and F4 almost completely inhibited fibril assembly, whereas F5 inhibited assembly by about 50% under the conditions of the experiment. Inhibition of fibril assembly with the peptide F3 was directly demonstrated by following the reaction in a sealed chamber with dark-field light microscopy. No fibrils appeared when F3 was present in a concentration of 2.5 mm (Fig. 3, right panel). The specificity of the effects was demonstrated by preparing a peptide in which the same amino acids found in F3 were assembled in a random sequence. As indicated in Fig. 2 (bottom panel), the peptide with the scrambled sequence (SC/F3) had no effect on fibril assembly. Assays in which the concentration of the peptide F3 were varied indicated that fibril assembly was inhibited about 45% with a concentration of about 1.5 mm and almost 100% with 2.5 mm (Table I).Figure 2Fibril formation in the presence of synthetic peptides. 14C-Labeled pCcollagen I (30 μg/ml) was incubated with C-proteinase (15 units/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C.

Magnification, 300×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To define the kinetics for inhibition of fibril assembly by the telopeptides, the peptide F3 was added in a concentration of 2.5 mm during the lag phase, early propagation phase, mid-propagation phase, or late propagation phase of fibril assembly (Fig. 4). The peptide inhibited fibril formation if added during the lag period. It partially inhibited if added during the early propagation phase, and it had little of any effect if added during the mid-propagation phase of fibril assembly. To test the specificity of the binding of the peptides to collagen, a series of hybridizations were carried out with filter blots of proteins and a biotinylated derivative of the peptide F3. As indicated in Fig. 5, the biotinylated peptide F3 did not bind to any component of bovine serum. However, it bound to α1(I) chains, β chains that included α1(I) chains, pCα1(I) chains, and pCα1(II) chains. The same peptide bound to CNBr peptides (Fig. 6). As indicated in Fig. 6 B, the biotinylated derivatives bound to the α1(I) chain but not the α2(I) chain. As also indicated in Fig. 6 B, the biotinylated telopeptides bound to CB7 of the α1(I) chain that contains amino acid residues 552–822. There was no apparent binding to any of the other cyanogen bromide fragments.Figure 6Binding of biotinylated telopeptides to the α(I) chain and the CB7 fragment chain.

As indicated in Fig. 7 (middle and right panels), the peptides bound specifically to the B fragment of the α1(I) chain. Since vertebrate collagenase cleaves the two α chains of type I collagen between residues 775 and 776 (1Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 1-40Google Scholar), the binding of the peptides to both CB7 and the B fragments of the α1(I) chain indicated that the binding site is between amino acid 776 and 822 of the α1(I) chain. Further experiments were primarily concentrated on the F3 peptide with the sequence of the C-telopeptide, because it was relatively short and somewhat repetitive in sequence (Fig. 1). To define the critical sequences within the peptide F3, several derivatives were prepared. Two peptides that were 9-mers overlapping the central region of the sequence (F7 and F8) were equally effective as the intact F3 (Figs. 1 and 8 and TableI). Smaller effects on inhibition of fibril assembly were seen with two other fragments (F9 and F10) (Figs. 1 and 7 and Table I). Of special interest was that mutating the two aspartates in a 9-mer peptide (F7) to serine residues (F7/A) had no effect on inhibition of fibril assembly. However, mutating two tyrosines and one phenylalanine in the same sequence to serine residues (F7/B) abolished inhibitory effects (Figs. 1 and 8 and Table I). To map the binding site in the triple helix still further, a peptide was prepared with the sequence of the amino acids in positions 776 to 796 of the α1(I). The sequence 776 to 796 was selected primarily because it was the most hydrophobic sequence in the region between 776 and 822 that was defined by the experiments with the CNBr peptides and the collagenase fragments (Fig. 9). The peptide α1–776/796 was then used in a competition binding assay in which collagen was bound to the wells of a microtiter plate, and the plates were incubated with a fixed concentration of one of the biotinylated telopeptides and varying concentrations the peptide α1–776/796. The binding of the biotinylated peptide was then assayed by incubation with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. As indicated in Fig. 10, the peptide α1–776/796 effectively competed with binding the C-telopeptides of the α1(I) chain (peptide F2) and the α2(I) chain (peptide F3). There was no competition for the binding site between biotinylated telopeptides and F1. Similar results (not shown) were obtained with the binding of the two N-telopeptides.Figure 10Competition by the peptide α-776/796 for the binding of the C-telopeptides to type I collagen. Type I collagen was bound to microtiter plates and then incubated with a mixture of a biotinylated telopeptide and varying concentrations of the competitor peptide α1–776/796. The washed filters were then assayed by reaction with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. Left panel, competition for binding of the biotinylated C-propeptide of the α1(I) chain (peptide F2). Right panel, competition for the binding of the C-telopeptide from the α2(I) chain (peptide F3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To model the binding of one of the telopeptides to the triple helix, the SYBYL program was first used to model the conformation of one of the nine-amino acid fragment (F7) of the α2C-telopeptide that inhibited fibril assembly (Figs. 1 and 8 and Table I). Because the aromatic Tyr and Phe residues tended to form a hydrophobic stack on one side of the polypeptide chain, a single conformation was favored (Fig. 11, A and B). Binding of F7 to the region between residues 781 to 794 of α1(I) chain was analyzed. The possible binding conformation was interactively identified using the DOCK command. The refined model demonstrated a favorable interaction of hydrophobic groups (Fig. 11 A) and electrostatic groups (Fig. 11 B). The results here resolve a critical question about the self-assembly of type I collagen into fibrils. If the assembly does not depend on specific interactions of binding sites in the monomers, as recently suggested by Parkinson et al. (27Parkinson J. Kadler K.E. Brass A. Physical Rev. E. 1994; 50: 2963-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), all the peptides tested here should either have had no effect on fibril assembly or inhibited the process to about the same degree. Instead, the results demonstrated that several peptides specifically inhibited the process. Consistent with previous observations (see Ref. 1Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 1-40Google Scholar), peptides with sequences found in the telopeptides were the most effective. The telopeptide that was most extensively studied, the C-telopeptide of the α2(I) chain, completely prevented fibril assembly if added at or before the first one-third of the lag phase but had much less effect thereafter. Therefore, the binding of the α2C-telopeptide, probably in concert with α1C-telopeptide, is critical for early steps in the assembly process such as formation of a structural nucleus that is essential for further growth of the fibrils. The binding of the C-telopeptides to the region that encompasses residues 776 to 796 places the monomers in quarter D-period stagger (Fig. 9). Therefore, the binding could initiate assembly of a Smith-type pentameter microfibril (see Refs. 1Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 1-40Google Scholar and 25Silver D. Miller J. Harrison R. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9860-9864Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding of the N-telopeptides to about the same region of the α1(I) chain (defined here as residues 776 to 822) places the D-periods out of register by one-third or more of a D-period of 234 residues. Therefore, the binding of the N-telopeptides cannot generate the 0D, 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D staggers that are found among many nearest neighbors in fibrils assembled in vivo. Also, the binding of the N-telopeptides does not accurately align the monomers for formation of the major covalent cross-link that forms between the Lys residue at position 9 of the N-telopeptide and the Lys residue at 930 of the α1(I) chain (1Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1984: 1-40Google Scholar, 36Nagan N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22366-22371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, there are several possible explanations for the observed binding of the N-telopeptides. One is that the binding occurs only with linear N-telopeptides such as those used here but not with N-telopeptides in the unusual hairpin conformation that is present in the native molecule (31Holmes D.F. Watson R.B. Steinmann B. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15758-15765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mould A.P. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Mol.

Biol. 1995; 247: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that is essential both for assembly into well ordered fibrils and correct cross-linking (36Nagan N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22366-22371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second explanation is that binding of the N-telopeptides generates aberrant structural nuclei that cannot grow into fibrils and that resembles the “overshoot” structures seen in the assembly of tobacco mosaic virus (37Potschka M. Koch M.H. Adams M.L. Schuster T.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8481-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Preliminary assays with an optical biosensor indicated that the dissociation constant for the binding of the α1C-telopeptide is about 5 × 10−6m, and the dissociation constants of the two N-telopeptides are about an order of magnitude greater. 2A. Fertala and D. J. Prockop, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, aberrant structures assembled by binding through the N-telopeptides may have a short half-life and may rapidly dissociate into monomers that initiate fibril assembly through binding of C-telopeptides. A third possibility is that binding through the N-telopeptides does not play an important role in fibril assembly until a core of a microfibril is formed, and it is only important for lateral growth of the fibril. The last suggestion is consistent with one of the proposed helical models for growth of microfibrils from paraboloidal tips (25Silver D. Miller J. Harrison R. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9860-9864Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The model required one specific binding step governed by one rate constant (k 1) for assembly of monomers in a 1D-stagger to form a Smith-type microfibrillar core and to regulate longitudinal growth of the fibril. It required a second binding step governed by a smaller rate constant (k 2) to initiate growth of a new layer of helical sheets of monomers on the microfibrillar core and thereby to regulate lateral growth of the core. The results here demonstrated that the binding of the C-telopeptide of the α2(I) chain to residues 776 to 796 of the α1(I) chain was directed primarily by hydrophobic interactions, since mutating two tyrosine residues and one phenylalanine residue in a nine-amino acid fragment abolished all effects on fibril formation, whereas mutating two aspartate residues had no effect. The modeling experiments indicated that there were conformations of the peptide and the triple helix that allowed good hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between the nine-amino acid fragment α2C-telopeptide and the region between 776 and 796. The region contains the C-terminal half of the vertebrate collagenase cleavage site that previously has been designated as a relatively flexible region of the collagen triple helix (38Brown R.A. Hukins D.W. Weiss J.B. Twose T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Also, Bhatnagar et al. (39Bhatnagar R.S. Qian J.J. Gough C.A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 14: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) recently examined a synthetic peptide with amino acid residues 776 to 780 from the region and found that it had a high potential to form a stable β-bend with the central GIAG sequence that begins in residues 775. Moreover, they demonstrated (38Brown R.A. Hukins D.W. Weiss J.B. Twose T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that the peptide inhibited the binding of fibroblasts to collagen at a concentration of 7.2 × 10−6m. Therefore, the sequence of amino acids in the region may take part in a large number of different binding interactions. Finally, it is apparent that given the specificity of the binding interactions, the sites defined here provide interesting targets for peptides, peptidomemetics, or related compounds that may inhibit the assembly of collagen fibers in pathologic fibrotic conditions. The ability to model binding sites in the triple helix and the conformation of short fragments of the telopeptides provides a rational route for developing inhibitors. The competitive assays on microtiter plates provide a means of high throughput screening for large libraries of potential inhibitors."

This is the first description of CCR1 receptor antagonists that may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases involving MIP-1α, RANTES, and CCR1. The directed migration of select populations of leukocytes from the circulation to sites of inflammation is an integral part of the immune response. The chemokines are a diverse group of proteins that play an important role in this process (1Baggiolini M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 351: 1-11Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). They are classified into two major groups, CXC and CC, based on the position of the first two of their four invariant cysteines (2Schall T. Thompson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 419-460Google Scholar). Each of the chemokines recognizes and induces the chemotaxis of a particular subset of leukocytes. For example, the CXC chemokines, like IL-8 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and melonoma growth stimulatory activity, mainly chemoattract and activate neutrophils, in contrast to the CC chemokines, like RANTES and monocyte chemoattractant protein, which preferentially attract T lymphocytes and monocytes and induce their activation by producing changes in cellular morphology, transient increases in cellular calcium concentration, and the up-regulation of surface adhesion proteins. The chemokines produce their biologic effects by interacting with specific receptors on the cell surface of their target cells (3Horuk R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 159-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To date, 14 different chemokine receptors including eight CC chemokine receptors have been identified by cloning (4Mackay C.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R384-R386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). All of these receptors are characterized by a heptahelical structure and belong to a superfamily of serpentine receptors that are coupled to guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) (6Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Occasionally the immune system can turn upon its host, giving rise to chronic inflammation and disease. Given their important role in this process, chemokines have been implicated in the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. For example a recent study by Karpus et al. (7Karpus W.J. Lukacs N.W. McRae B.L. Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Miller S.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5003-5010PubMed Google Scholar) provides strong in vivo concept validation for a role of MIP-1α in a mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis. These investigators were able to show that antibodies to MIP-1α prevented the development of both acute and relapsing paralytic disease as well as infiltration of mononuclear cells into the central nervous system. Treatment with MIP-1α antibody was also able to ameliorate the severity of ongoing clinical disease. These results led the authors to conclude that MIP-1α plays an important role in this T-cell mediated disease. In addition Godiskaet al. (8Godiska R. Chantry D. Dietsch G.N. Gray P.W. J. Neuroimmunol. 1995; 58: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) have shown an up-regulation of mRNA for a number of chemokines, including MIP-1α, in EAE. A number of reports have shown that both RANTES mRNA and protein appear to be up-regulated in rheumatoid arthritis (9Rathanaswami P. Hachicha M. Sadick M. Schall T.J. McColl S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5834-5839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Snowden N. Hajeer A. Thomson W. Ollier B. Lancet. 1994; 343: 547-548Abstract PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For example, cultured synovial fibroblasts isolated from rheumatoid patients when treated with IL-1 were shown to up-regulate the expression of RANTES both at the mRNA and protein levels (9Rathanaswami P. Hachicha M. Sadick M. Schall T.J. McColl S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5834-5839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly Snowden et al. have used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to detect RANTES mRNA in synovial tissue samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (10Snowden N. Hajeer A. Thomson W. Ollier B. Lancet. 1994; 343: 547-548Abstract PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on these studies there is strong evidence in support of the concept that the chemokines RANTES and MIP-1α play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Since MIP-1α and RANTES are ligands for CCR1, this receptor, located on circulating mononuclear cells, is a prime therapeutic target for these debilitating diseases. These studies then provided the rationale for establishing a program to inhibit MIP-1α- and RANTES-mediated biological activities by developing highly potent and specific non-peptide CCR1 receptor antagonists. We developed an empirical screening program to discover potential inhibitors of125I-MIP-1α binding to the CCR1 receptor. We describe here a series of 4-hydroxypiperidines that possess functional antagonist activity at the CCR1 receptor. The compounds in this series have K i values of inhibition of chemokine binding ranging from 40 to 4000 nm and are functional antagonists. Unlabeled chemokines were from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). 125I-Labeled chemokines were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Compounds 1–7 (see Fig. 1) were synthesized in a manner similar to that outlined as follows. To a solution of diphenylacetonitrile (2.0 g, 10.3 mmol) in 100 ml ofN,N-dimethylformamide was carefully added sodium hydride (0.5 g, 12.4 mmol, 60% in oil) in small portions. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 15 min, and then 1-chloro-3-iodopropane (3.1 g, 15 mmol) was added in one portion. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature. After 20 h, the reaction was quenched with 200 ml of water and extracted with two portions of ethyl acetate (200 ml). The combined organic extracts were washed with water (2 × 400 ml) and then brine (400 ml), dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuoto a yellow oil. Purification by flash column chromatography on silica gel afforded 2.0 g of 5-chloro-2,2-diphenylvaleronitrile as a white solid. This solid (136 mg, 0.48 mmol) was dissolved in 5 ml ofN,N-dimethylformamide and 4-phenyl-4-hydroxypiperidine (86 mg, 0.48 mmol) was added, followed by potassium carbonate (330 mg, 2.4 mol, powdered). The resultant suspension was stirred at 45 °C for 20 h and then poured into 20 ml of water and 20 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was separated, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to a yellow oil. Purification by flash column chromatography on silica gel afforded 140 mg of compound 3 as a clear, colorless oil. The structure and purity of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and combustion analysis. The human monocytic cell line THP1 and the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in RPMI or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For binding assays, the cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion, and cell number was determined by counting the cells in a hemocytometer. CCR1 cDNA was obtained as described (11Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) and inserted into a mammalian expression vector containing the SV40 replication origin, the human cytomegaloviral enhancer with the puromycin N-acetyltransferase gene (puromycin resistance) and hygromycin B gene (hygromycin resistance), similar to that described previously (12Amatruda III, T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Huang M.T. Gorman C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were grown to confluent monolayers in T flasks (225 cm2). CCR1 plasmid (10 μg) was added to 125 mm Ca2+-containing Hanks' balanced salts (final volume 500 μl) and incubated 15 min at room temperature. Prior to transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated (2–3 × 106 cells) in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in growth medium and allowed to recover for 16 h. Growth medium was then removed and replaced with 4 ml of calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salts (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were placed back in a 37 °C incubator. The DNA mixture was immediately applied to the HEK 293 cells and further incubated 3–4 h at 37 °C. The Hanks' balanced salts/DNA mixture was then removed, and the cells were placed back in growth media for 16 h. Hygromycin was added to growth media at a final concentration of 150 μg/ml, and puromycin was added back at 5 μg/ml. Cells were grown for 3 weeks, and media were replaced every 3 days. Once a pooled clone was established, cells were sorted with an N-terminal CCR1 polyclonal antibody (14Hesselgesser J. Halks-Miller M. DelVecchio V. Peiper S.C. Hoxie J. Kolson D.L. Taub D. Horuk R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 112-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) by indirect fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cells sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting were placed back in growth media with hygromycin/puromycin and expanded. Cells were tested for their ability to bind 125I-labeled MIP-1α and RANTES and for biological responses by measuring changes in intracellular Ca2+. The high capacity screening assays were performed in 96-well V-bottom microtiter plates (Nunc, polypropylene) in a total volume of 100 μl. HEK 293 cells expressing the human CCR1 receptor (K D = 1–3 nmand B max = 2–3 × 106sites/cell) were used as the source of the CCR1 receptor. The cells were detached by trypsinization and plated into flasks at least 48 h prior to the experiment. HEK 293 cells expressing the CCR1 receptor were detached by shaking, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in the assay buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 50 mm Tris, 30 μg/ml bacitracin, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) to about 1.1 × 105 cells/ml. Cells (about 8000 cells/well) were incubated with 125I-MIP-1α (specific activity 2200 Ci/mmol; about 15,000–20,000 cpm/assay) in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of compounds at room temperature for 30–40 min. The reactions were terminated by harvesting through a GF/B filter plate (Packard) presoaked with 0.3% PEI (Sigma catalog number P-3143) plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin and washing five times with cold PBS. The radioactivity in each well was determined by scintillation counting (Topcount Packard) following the addition of 50 μl of scintillation fluid, Scint-20. The nonspecific binding was defined by the binding in the presence of 100 nm unlabeled MIP-1α. The dose curves of each compound with six concentration points were generated, and IC50 values were determined by fitting the data to the log-logit equation (linear) with an EXCEL spread-sheet. TheK i values were then calculated by dividing the IC50 by 1.025. For other binding assays, cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated in PBS with125I-labeled ligands (0.2 nm) and varying concentrations of unlabeled ligands or compounds at 4 °C for 1 h. The incubation was terminated by removing aliquots from the cell suspension and separating cells from buffer by centrifugation through a silicone/paraffin oil mixture as described previously (15Robb R.J. Greene W.C. Rusk C.M. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1126-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled ligand. The binding data were curve fit with the computer program IGOR (Wavemetrics) to determine the affinity (K D), number of receptor sites. THP-1 cells were washed once with a modified RPMI 1640 medium (containing 1 mm sodium phosphate, supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and resuspended in the same media at a density of 1 × 106 cells/0.1 ml. Cell suspension of 150 μl was mixed with 50 μl of agarose cell entrapment medium (Molecular Devices), and 7 μl of the cell-agarose mixture was spotted into the center of a disposable polycarbonate cell capsules (Molecular Devices) (16Parce J.W. Owicki J.C. Kercso K.M. Sigal G.B. Wada H.G. Muir V.C. Bousse L.J. Ross K.L. Sikic B.I. McConnell H.M. Science. 1989; 246: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The cell numbers in each well were about 300,000–600,000. To measure the rate of acidification, the assembled cell capsules with the agarose-entrapped cells were loaded into the chambers of the microphysiometer (Molecular Devices). The chambers were perfused with the low buffering media at a rate of 100 μl/min. For each cycle of operation, the cells were perfused with the media for 50 s, and then the flow was interrupted for 40 s, during which the rate of acidification of the media was measured and recorded. The flow was resumed, and the next cycle was begun. The chamber temperature was 37 °C. After stabilization, the cells were perfused with the indicated concentrations of chemokine and/or compound for about 100 s during which the rate of acidification was measured. HEK 293 cells expressing the CCR1 receptor were loaded by incubation with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salts solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 3.2 mm calcium chloride. Cells were pelleted, washed with Hanks' balanced salts solution, and resuspended in the same medium at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 2 ml of this suspension, or 2 × 106 cells, were used for each experiment. Changes in the cytosolic free Ca2+concentration were measured with an SLM/Aminco model AB2 fluorescence spectrophotometer. To determine the reversibility of the CCR1 antagonist, HEK 293 cells expressing CCR1 were loaded with Fura-2/AM as above and preincubated with 1000 nm compound 1 for 15 min. The cells were then washed twice with 100-fold PBS buffer for 15 min at 37 °C and stimulated with 10 nm MIP-1α. Cell migration was examined using a 48-well microchemotaxis assay as described previously (17Taub D.D. Key M.L. Clark D. Turcovski-Corrales S.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of chemokines (1.25, 12.5, and 125 nm) were placed in the lower wells of a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber. PBMCs (2 × 106 cells/ml) derived from a normal healthy leukophoresis donor (CIS0003, age 27, male, Caucasian) treated with or without compound 1 at concentrations of 20, 200, and 2000 nm for 30 min at 37 °C were then placed in the upper compartment of the chamber. The upper and lower wells of the chamber were separated by a 5-μm polycarbonate filter coated with laminin (Sigma). The chambers were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C (a time period over which chemokine equilibrium between the upper and lower chambers is optimally achieved) after which the filters were scraped, washed, fixed with methanol, and stained with Diff-Quik. Cell migration was measured by counting the number of cells attached to the lower surface of the filter in six high power fields, and each concentration of chemokine was tested in either triplicate or sets of six wells. The results were expressed as the number of migrating cells per six high power fields (±S.D.). Since the CCR1 receptor ligands RANTES and MIP-1α appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, this receptor is a prime therapeutic target. Although peptide antagonists of chemokine receptors have been described, they suffer from poor metabolic stability and oral bioavailability, thereby limiting their therapeutic utility. For this reason, we set out to discover potent, selective, small molecule antagonists of the CCR1 receptor for use as potential therapeutics in autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors have been an extremely fertile source of biological targets in the pharmaceutical industry. The actual drugs that interact with this receptor superfamily are too numerous to detail but include antihistamines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antimuscarinics, α- and β-adrenoreceptor agonist and antagonists, opiates, prostanoids, etc. More recently, compound library screening has proven successful in the discovery of antagonists of neuropeptide receptors, i.e. Pfizer's substance P antagonist (18Snider R.M. Constantine J.W. Lowe J.A. Longo K.P. Lebel W.S. Woody H.A. Drozda S.E. Desai M.C. Vinick F.J. Spencer R.W. Hess H.-J.

Casiano F. Ward S.J. Houck W.T. Faunce D.M. Douty B.D. Baizman E. Awad M.M. Marceau F. Seoane P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and Sanofi's neurotensin antagonist (21Gully D. Canton M. Boigegrain R. Jeanjean F. Molimard J.C. Poncelet M. Gueudet C. Heaulme M.

Thus, based on these and numerous other additional (endothelin, vasopressin, angiotensin II, etc.) past successes using an empirical file screening approach, it seemed reasonable to pursue leads for the CCR1 receptor in this manner. The initial approach involved empirical screening of our available compound libraries to discover potential CCR1 receptor antagonists. Initial screening of 125I-MIP-1α binding to the CCR1 receptor transfected into the HEK 293 cell line yielded 258 compounds that demonstrated >50% inhibition of binding at a concentration of 5 μm. Several of these active compounds belonged to the same structural family, the 4-hydroxypiperidines (Fig. 1) and were investigated in greater detail. The K i values of these compounds were determined from concentration-response curves based on their ability to displace the specific binding of 125I-labeled MIP-1α in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the CCR1 receptor. Competition binding studies for the 4-hydroxypiperidine compounds 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 2 A. Compounds 1 and 2 were able to competitively displace radiolabeled MIP-1α with an IC50 of 40 and 347 nm, respectively. In addition, the 4-hydroxypiperidines were shown to displace radiolabeled RANTES binding from the same transfected cells with similar IC50 values (Fig. 2 B and TableI). These data demonstrate that templates possessing the 4-hydroxypiperidine moiety are potent inhibitors of RANTES and MIP-1α binding to the CCR1 receptor.Table IThe Ki of radiolabeled MIP-1α and RANTES binding to the CCR1 receptor by 4-hydroxypiperidine analogsCompoundK i of MIP-1α bindingaS.E. for n ≥ 2.K i of RANTES bindingaS.E. for n ≥ 2.nmnmMIP-1α2 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.1RANTES7 ± 0.521 ± 0.4140 ± 660 ± 32347 ± 65268 ± 173651 ± 27NDbND, not determined.4153 ± 8616 ± 845715 ± 27NDbND, not determined.64000 ± 600NDbND, not determined.75000cData from Ref. 22.6cData from Ref. 22.a S.E. for n ≥ 2.b ND, not determined.c Data from Ref. 22Kato K.

Open table in a new tab The 4-hydroxypiperidine moiety was optimized by synthesizing a number of analogs (Fig. 1) and examining their ability to inhibit MIP-1α binding to CCR1 (Table I). Several interesting points are worth noting from this study. First, substitution of the piperidinol phenyl segment by a halogen (compound 1) improves activity over compound 3, which does not have a halogen. Other groups such as OMe or CF3 (compounds 2 and 4) appeared to be less favorable. In addition, the phenyl ring appears to be important for activity, since replacement by a naphthyl group (compound 5) reduced potency almost 20-fold, while replacement by a butyl group (compound 6) lead to an almost total loss of activity. Interestingly, we were recently made aware of a patent filed by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. in which they describe a urea piperidine derivative of the nitrile group (compound 7), which had a reported IC50 for MIP-1α binding of 5000 nm and a reported IC50 for RANTES binding of 6 nm(22Kato K. Yamamoto M. Honda S. Fujisawa T. U. S. PatentWO 97/24325. 1997; Google Scholar). The medicinal chemistry outlined above identified a number of small molecules as potent inhibitors of chemokine binding to the CCR1 receptor. To determine whether these molecules were also functional antagonists of the CCR1 receptor, we measured their ability to inhibit MIP-1α- and RANTES-induced biological responses by microphysiometry (16Parce J.W. Owicki J.C. Kercso K.M. Sigal G.B. Wada H.G. Muir V.C. Bousse L.J. Ross K.L. Sikic B.I. McConnell H.M. Science. 1989; 246: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The biological activity of MIP-1α was initially assessed by stimulating THP-1 cells, which have been shown to express CCR1 (23Gao J.-L. Kuhns D.B. Tiffany H.L. McDermott D. Li X. Francke U. Murphy P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), with the chemokine and measuring their increase in extracellular acidification rate. As shown in Fig. 3, MIP-1α induced a rapid increase in the extracellular acidification rate, reaching a maximum after about 2 min and returning close to base-line levels within 8–10 min. The MIP-1α effect on THP-1 cells was dose-dependent, and at 1 nm it produced an approximately 50–60% increase in extracellular acidification. These kinetics are quite similar to those reported for chemokines in human monocytes and in transfected cell lines (24Vaddi K. Newton R.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Samson M. Labbe O. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3362-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with increasing concentrations of compound 1 dose-responsively inhibited the ability of MIP-1α to induce changes in the metabolic activity of the cells (Fig. 3). The concentration of compound 1 required to half-maximally inhibit 1 nm MIP-1α was 124 nm, about 6-fold higher than that predicted from the binding constants for compound 1 and MIP-1α, which were 40 and 2 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). Compound 1 was also able to inhibit RANTES-induced changes in THP-1 cells, similar to the inhibition demonstrated for MIP-1α (data not shown). MIP-1α or RANTES activation of the CCR1 receptor elicits an increase in the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+ (11Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), which was examined to further evaluate the pharmacologic effects of the CCR1 antagonists in vitro. The change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in response to a single concentration of chemokine was measured by fluorimetry using HEK 293 cells transfected with CCR1 receptors loaded with the indicator Fura-2/AM. As shown in Fig. 4, MIP-1α (10 nm) produced a transient rise in intracellular Ca2+. When compound 1 was added to the cells, at concentrations up to 1 μm, in the absence of MIP-1α, no stimulation in Ca2+ was observed (data not shown), indicating that the compound had no intrinsic agonist activity. However, preincubation of compound 1 with CCR1-transfected HEK 293 cells prior to the addition of MIP-1α dose-responsively inhibited the increase in Ca2+elicited by the chemokine (Fig. 4). The concentration of compound 1 required to half-maximally inhibit 10 nm MIP-1α was around 200 nm, well in line with that predicted from the binding constants for compound 1 and MIP-1α (Fig. 2). Compound 1 was also able to effectively inhibit the RANTES-induced increase in Ca2+ (data not shown). To determine the reversibility of this effect, cells incubated with 1000 nmcompound 1 were washed twice in PBS to remove the inhibitor and then stimulated with 10 nm MIP-1α. The washed cells were able to respond to the chemokine in a manner similar to that of cells untreated with the antagonist (Fig. 4). Further functional characterization of the antagonism by compound 1 was investigated in cells transfected with the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR2. CCR5 is a related chemokine receptor that responds to MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES, while CXCR2 responds to IL-8 and melanoma growth stimulatory activity as agonists. Importantly, while compound 1 antagonized the effects of RANTES or MIP-1α on the Ca2+response in cells expressing CCR1, no such attenuation of MIP-1β- or IL-8-stimulated Ca2+ flux was evident in cells expressing CCR5 and CXCR2, respectively (Fig. 5). This finding suggests selectivity of antagonism, consistent with the selectivity of this compound in binding studies (see below) and that the blockade of the Ca2+signal is not due to a nonspecific effect. Chemokines were originally defined and classified as potent leukocyte chemoattractants, mediating their effects through G-protein-coupled receptors (26Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). Thus, we assessed the ability of the CCR1 antagonist compound 1 to attenuate the directed migration of PBMCs stimulated with a number of CC and CXC chemokines. As shown in Fig. 6, a 16-fold excess of compound 1 dose-responsively inhibited the MIP-1α- and RANTES-mediated migration of PBMCs but had no affect on the migration of PBMCs stimulated with MIP-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein, or stromal cell-derived factor-1α. These data demonstrate that compound 1 is a potent antagonist for CCR1 but has no effects on the related chemokine receptors CCR5, CCR2, and CXCR4. The specificity of antagonism of the CCR1 receptor antagonistsversus other receptors or biological targets is a critical component to establishing a quality lead compound. This is particularly important, since the CCR1 receptor belongs to a superfamily of seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors that at the present time numbers well over 450 members and responds to a diverse array of ligands (27Henikoff S. Greene E.A. Pietrokovski S. Bork P. Attwood T.K. Hood L. Science. 1997; 278: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus, the selectivity of the potential CCR1 antagonist compound 1 was tested in a panel of radioligand binding assays for activity with members of this superfamily of receptors, including related chemokine receptors and unrelated neurotransmitter receptors. It is quite encouraging that while the activity of this compound is under 40 nm at the CCR1 receptor, it is more than 250-fold less active for most of these other receptors, including the related chemokine receptor CCR5, which binds RANTES and MIP-1α with high affinity (Table II). The only potential cross-reactivity of compound 1 was with several biogenic amine neurotransmitter receptors, a result not surprising for a structure reminiscent of the typical neuroleptic/antidepressant structural motif (28Cusack B. Nelson A. Richelson E. Psychopharmacology. 1994; 114: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 29Richelson E. J. Clin.

Open table in a new tab Compound 1 was tested in receptor binding assays on a number of seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors. All receptors were expressed in HEK cells except for the following: CXCR4 in Jurkat, adrenergic β-2 in NBR1 cells, bradykinin in HS729 cells, endothelin in Chinese hamster ovary cells, muscarinic M1 and M2 in Sf9 insect cells. Binding assays were carried out in whole cells at 4 °C and at compound concentrations of 1 and 10 μm. Although we have not established the direct mechanism by which these compounds are able to act as functional antagonists of the CCR1 receptor, we can rule out at least two formal possibilities. Since MIP-1α and RANTES are able to bind with high affinity to CCR1 and CCR5 but the CCR1 antagonist compound 1 only inhibited binding of the ligands to CCR1, these data would tend to rule out inhibition of ligand binding by direct interaction between the ligand and the compound. Compound 1 was also unable to inhibit MIP-1β binding to CCR5, IL-8, or melanoma growth stimulatory factor binding to CXCR2 and stromal cell-derived factor-1α binding to CXCR4, thus further demonstrating CCR1 receptor specificity. We can also rule out inhibition due to toxicity of the compounds, since, in Ca2+ flux experiments, the addition of the compound alone does not lead to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ by increasing uptake from the extracellular milieu as might be observed in cells that were semipermeable. We favor the idea that our compounds are directly competing for binding to specific sites on the CCR1 and thus antagonize the ability of the chemokine ligands to transduce a biologic effect by receptor blockade. Further studies will be carried out to determine the nature and site of interaction of the receptor-antagonist complex. In summary, we have described here a class of highly potent nonpeptide antagonists of the CCR1 receptor. These compounds appear to be highly specific for the CCR1 receptor and are to our knowledge the first known examples of nonpeptide antagonists of a CC chemokine receptor. Classically, knowledge of the functional role of seven-transmembrane domain receptors has come from pharmacological studies using specific high affinity receptor antagonists. Thus, these compounds should also prove to be useful tools with which to evaluate the role of CCR1 receptors in normal physiology and in disease. Finally, this class of nonpeptide antagonists of the CCR1 receptor should hold promise for the future design of more potent, highly selective agents that could be useful therapeutically in treating autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1968985125,"In vitro studies have shown that ferritin iron incorporation is mediated by a ferroxidase activity associated with ferritin H subunits (H-Ft) and a nucleation center associated with ferritin L subunits (L-Ft). To assess the role played by the ferritin subunits in regulating intracellular iron distribution, we transfected mouse erythroleukemia cells with the H-Ft subunit gene mutated in the iron-responsive element. Stable transfectants displayed high H-Ft levels and reduced endogenous L-Ft levels, resulting in a marked change in the H:L subunit ratio from 1:1 in control cells to as high as 20:1 in some transfected clones. The effects of H-Ft overexpression on the labile iron pool were determined in intact cells by a novel method based on the fluorescent metallosensor calcein. H-Ft overexpression resulted in a significant reduction in the iron pool, from 1.3 μm in control cells to 0.56 μm in H-Ft transfectants, and in higher buffering capacity following iron loads. A fraction of the H-Ft-associated iron was labile, available to cell-permeant, but not cell-impermeant, chelators. The results of this study provide the first in vivo direct demonstration of the capacity of H-Ft to sequester cell iron and to regulate the levels of the labile iron pool.

Most mammalian cells acquire iron by the receptor-mediated endocytosis of iron-transferrin complexes. After internalization of transferrin into endocytic vesicles, iron is translocated across the endosomal membrane into a cytosolic labile iron pool (LIP), 1The abbreviations used are: LIP, labile iron pool; IRP, iron-responsive protein; IRE, iron-responsive element; Ft, ferritin; H-Ft, heavy ferritin; L-Ft, light ferritin; H and L subunits, heavy and light subunits, respectively; MEL, mouse erythroleukemia; SIH, salicylaldehyde-isocotinoyl-hydrazone; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; FAS, ferrous ammonium sulfate; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; HMBA, N,N′-hexamethylene bisacetamide. from which it is distributed among various cellular compartments (1Ponka P.

In most mammalian cells, iron-responsive proteins (IRPs), belonging to the aconitase family of enzymes, act as regulators of cell iron by sensing putative LIP levels and affecting either the stability or the translation of specific mRNAs coding for proteins associated with iron metabolism (6Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 174-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In the native form, IRP has a high affinity for a nucleotide motif called “iron-responsive element” (IRE), which is present primarily in the 5′-noncoding region of ferritin (Ft) mRNAs and in the 3′-noncoding region of the transferrin receptor mRNA. Binding of IRP to these IREs represses Ft synthesis and stabilizes transferrin receptor mRNA. However, upon cell iron loading, IRPs undergo changes in their mRNA binding affinities (7Tang C.K. Chin J. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24466-24470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in their half-life (8Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby enabling both Ft translation and degradation of transferrin receptor mRNA to proceed. This coordinated regulation of iron uptake and storage serves as the major mechanism of cell iron homeostasis (5Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 6Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 174-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). An additional mode of regulation of the LIP operates through modification of the subunit composition of the Ft molecule (9Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such modifications are likely to be of physiological importance since recentin vitro studies indicated that recombinant human heavy and light subunits (H-Ft and L-Ft, respectively) play distinct roles in iron incorporation and subsequent iron core formation within ferritin molecules (10Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). The sequestration of the metal has been primarily attributed to a ferroxidase activity associated with H-Ft subunits (11Levi S. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. Cozzi A. Franceschinelli F. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18086-18092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and formation of the iron core to a nucleation center associated with the L-Ft subunit (12Levi S. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Corsi B. Tamborini E. Spada S. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The alleged functional division of iron handling is apparent in the tissue distribution of the respective Ft subunit mRNAs and protein (13Gerard B. Farman N. Raja K.B. Eugène E. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is also corroborated by increased H-Ft gene transcription following cell exposure to cytokines (14Kwak E.L. Larochelle D.A. Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15285-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), oxidative stress (15Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol.

Oncol. 1997; 11: 187-192PubMed Google Scholar). In some of these situations, the induction of H-Ft expression was assumed to confer upon cells a defensive tool against iron-mediated oxidative injury and possibly other properties. In a recent work (9Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that induced overexpression of the H-Ft subunit from a transgene transfected into mouse erythroleukemia cells (MEL) leads to IRP activation and a concomitant reduction in both Hb production and endogenous Ft synthesis. This result led us to hypothesize that the regulation of H-Ft expression is a major factor in controlling cellular LIP levels and associated functions. However, it is only recently that an experimental approach for determining the LIP in intact living cells has become available (19Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24209-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20Epsztejn S. Kakhlon O. Glickstein H. Breuer W. Cabantchik I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Using the intracellular fluorescence metallosensor calcein, we attempted here to directly assess the proposed roles of H-Ft in model systems. The results presented here provide the first demonstration for the in vivo down-regulation of the LIP by overexpression of H-Ft and the role played by this protein in the overall regulation of iron distribution in cellular compartments. 55FeCl3 (5 mCi/mg iron) and [35S]methionine (400 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham International. Calcein and calcein/AM were procured from Molecular Probes, Inc. SIH was a kind gift of Prof. Prem Ponka (McGill University, Montreal, Canada), and macromolecular HES-DFO (6 desferrioxamine/M r 50,000 starch molecule) was donated by Biomedical Frontiers (Minneapolis, MN). The construct, described in detail elsewhere (9Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contains the entire murine H-Ft gene in which the first 2 bases of the IRE loop have been deleted, 1 kilobase of promoter region, 2.6 kilobases of 3′-flanking sequence, the Neo selection gene under control of the thymidine kinase promoter, and hypersensitive site II from β-globin locus control region (21Needham M. Gooding C. Hudson K. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. Hollis M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MEL cells were transfected by electroporation, and individual clones of transfected cells were selected in methyl cellulose in the presence of G418 (800 μg/ml). Biosynthesis of H-Ft and L-Ft was assessed by suspending 15 × 106 cells in methionine-free medium supplemented with 75 μCi of [35S]methionine, incubating for 2 h, washing, and lysing (22Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Massover W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7923-7926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The same amount of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was used for immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-Ft antibodies followed by protein A-Sepharose. After solubilization, the samples were loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the radioactivity associated with each Ft subunit was estimated with an Instant-Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays specific for mouse H-Ft and L-Ft were used to evaluate the ferritin content in cells (23Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Altimare D. Crippa A. Levi S. Albertini A. Arosio P. International Symposium on Iron in Biology and Medicine, June 15–20, 1997. 1997; (Saint Malo, France (abstr.)): 230Google Scholar). Microtiter plates were coated with 1 μg of polyclonal antibodies specific for the recombinant mouse H or L chain. Controls, standard ferritins, and soluble cell lysates were added to the plates, and the bound ferritin was revealed with the same antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Activity was developed witho-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). The LIP was assayed as recently described (20Epsztejn S. Kakhlon O. Glickstein H. Breuer W. Cabantchik I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with 0.125 μm calcein/AM for 5 min at 37 °C in bicarbonate-free medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.3. After washing, the cells were resuspended in the same medium without calcein/AM and maintained at room temperature. Prior to measurements, 1 ml of the cell suspension was centrifuged; the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of prewarmed HBS and placed in a stirred, thermostated (37 °C) cuvette; and fluorescence was monitored at an excitation of 488 nm and an emission of 517 nm in a Photon Technology Instrument fluorescence station. Anti-calcein fluorescence-quenching antibodies were added to ensure that all recorded fluorescence originated from within the cells (24Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik I.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The calcein-loaded cells have a fluorescence component (ΔF) that is quenched by intracellular iron and can be revealed by addition of 100 μm SIH, a highly permeant iron chelator. The rise in fluorescence (ΔF) provides a measure of the cell calcein-bound iron concentration ([CA-Fe]), which, together with the experimentally determined [CA-Fe] K d of 0.22 μm (20Epsztejn S. Kakhlon O. Glickstein H. Breuer W. Cabantchik I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and the mass law equation, yields the [Fe] in equilibrium with cell [CA]. LIP levels are given as [CA-Fe] + [Fe]. The rate of iron accumulation in the LIP was assessed by monitoring the rate of fluorescence quenching of calcein-loaded cells in the presence of 20 μm Fe(II) given as ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS). Iron uptake was stopped by addition of HES-DFO (100 μm), and cell iron [CA-Fe] + [Fe] was retrieved by addition of a 100 μmconcentration of the permeant chelator SIH. An iron solution of 263 μm was prepared by mixing55FeCl3 (1.4 mm in 0.1m HCl) with 56FeSO4 (2 mm in 0.1 m HCl) at a molar ratio of 1:10 in the presence of 0.27 m sucrose (stock solution of 1m) and of a 50-fold molar excess of β-mercaptoethanol. Cells (2 × 107) were incubated for 10 min with 55 μm iron, washed, and resuspended in HBS supplemented with either 500 μm DTPA or 100 μm dialyzed HES-DFO and 1% bovine serum albumin. Immediately or after a 20-min incubation, the cells were washed with HBS and 1% bovine serum albumin and with HBS alone, harvested, and lysed for 20 min in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 40 mm KCl, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by 5 min at 55 °C. The radioactivity was counted in 2 μl of the lysate, and the same amount of radioactivity was loaded on a 7.5% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. The transfection strategy using a plasmid carrying a 2-base mutated IRE was designed to generate MEL cells expressing exogenous H-Ft in a mode uncoupled from feedback regulation by iron (9Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The individual transfected clones were selected and analyzed for transgene expression by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using fluorescent oligonucleotides located on either side of the mutation. Of 15 selected clones, we retained clones 6 and 12, in which the transgene mRNA reached 80% of the endogenous level, and clone 16, in which the transgene mRNA was only 20% of the endogenous level. The biosynthesis of Ft in the various clones was followed by immunoprecipitation of metabolically 35S-labeled cells with anti-Ft antibodies and analysis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1 A). The biosynthetic capacity of H-Ft relative to L-Ft subunits was highest in cells from clones 6 and 12, about equal in clone 16, and lowest in untransfected cells. These apparent differences were even more pronounced when the respective Ft subunits were compared in terms of steady-state accumulation measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1 B). In the control clone, the levels of H and L subunits were similar (190 and 188 ng of ferritin/mg of protein, respectively). In clones 6 and 12, H-Ft levels were 4–6-fold higher than in control cells, and the L-Ft levels were drastically reduced, so that 90% of the cell Ft was composed of H subunits. Relative to control cells, clone 16 showed only moderately elevated levels of H-Ft (300 ng/mg of protein) and a 2-fold reduction in cell L-Ft (90 ng/mg of protein). It is interesting to note that despite of the relatively faster synthesis of L versus H subunits, their protein levels were equivalent, possibly reflecting differences in protein stability and turnover. A fluorescence method was applied to the various transfectants forin situ detection of cell iron and estimation of their LIP levels (24Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Millgram P. Cabantchik I.Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1354-C1361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of 12 independent measurements done in parallel on each individual clone are summarized in TableI. They indicate that whereas clone 16 cells had steady-state LIP levels comparable to those of control cells (1.3 and 1.14 μm, respectively), clones 6 and 12 cells showed a significant (∼50%) reduction in their LIP levels. To confirm that those differences in LIP levels associated with the different clones were directly related to H-Ft accumulation, we also followed H-Ft expression and LIP levels during 2 days of HMBA induction. The presence of an erythroid-specific enhancer (hypersensitive site II) in the construct increases the production of exogenous H-Ft mRNA, although to a variable extent in the different clones (data not shown). The HMBA treatment resulted in a progressive (up to 2-fold) accumulation of H-Ft and a reduction in LIP levels and hemoglobin synthesis, particularly in clones 6 and 12 (TableII). These studies clearly indicate an inverse relationship between H-Ft expression and the steady-state LIP levels in the various clones expressing different levels of H-Ft, whether before or following induction by HMBA.Table ILIP levels in MEL cellsControlClone 6Clone 12Clone 16μmFe(II)μm Fe(II)μmFe(II)μm Fe(II)1.30 ± 0.170.56 ± 0.14aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) from the control in both unpaired and paired t-tests.0.65 ± 0.10aSignificant difference (p < 0.05) from the control in both unpaired and paired t-tests.1.14 ± 0.13LIP values were measured by the calcein-based method in cells taken from exponentially growing cultures and are given in terms of mean cellular iron concentrations (mean ± S.E.) calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (n = 12 independent measurements made on separate cultures).a Significant difference (p < 0.05) from the control in both unpaired and paired t-tests.

To assess the possible role of H-Ft in buffering the LIP following imposed (acute) iron loads, we used an exogenous source of Fe(II) and followed iron diversion into Ft and into the LIP. The various cell clones were acutely loaded with55Fe(II) sulfate for 10 min, washed with the impermeant chelator HES-DFO, and lysed either immediately or after a subsequent incubation in the presence of HES-DFO or DTPA (500 μm). Cytoplasmic extracts were loaded directly on a 7.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in parallel with recombinant mouse H-Ft incubatedin vitro with 55Fe(II) sulfate (Fig. 2). In clones 6 and 12, the major radioactive band migrated at exactly the same position as the in vitro labeled recombinant H subunit, differing from the radioactive band in the control clone. Interestingly, in clone 16, Ft migrated as a relatively broader band, suggesting a more heterogeneous subunit composition of the Ft molecules than in the other clones. Clones 6 and 12 took up the highest amount of radiolabeled iron into Ft, virtually all in a form unavailable to the impermeant iron chelator HES-DFO. However, in the presence of excess DTPA, which slowly but demonstrably permeates into MEL cells, 2S. Epsztejn, W. Breuer, and Z. I. Cabantchik, unpublished observations. a sizable amount of55Fe could be dissociated from the Ft in a 20-min incubation period (Fig. 2). This might indicate that, at the early phase of iron incorporation into H-Ft, the metal can be labile, inasmuch as it can be recruited by permeant iron chelators. The parallel rise in LIP levels following acute iron loads was monitored in terms of time-dependent changes in the fluorescence induced by exposure of calcein-loaded cells to FAS (Fig. 3). Entry of the quenching metal into cells was stopped by addition of the impermeant iron chelator HES-DFO. The permeant iron chelator SIH was added subsequently, and the ensuing recovery of fluorescence was converted into calcein-bound iron concentrations ([CA-Fe]), as depicted in Fig. 3 (bar graph). The data indicate that clones displaying the lowest levels of H-Ft (control and clone 16) were precisely those that showed the greatest increase in LIP levels, whereas clones 6 and 12, which express the highest H-Ft levels, had not only a constitutive lower LIP level, but also a better capacity for maintaining lower LIP levels following imposed iron loads. Taken in toto, the H-Ft-overexpressing MEL cells have a demonstrably higher capacity for scavenging incoming iron and limiting the rise in LIP levels, following an acute iron load. This property is referred as the iron-buffering capacity of the cell. In this paper, we provide direct evidence supporting the functional role of H-Ft in regulating the cytoplasmic LIP. The study was based on the generation of clones of MEL cells expressing various levels of H-Ft (9Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the advent of a novel method for tracing metals in living cells (19Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24209-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The clones selected for this study carried a stable transfected mouse H-Ft gene mutated in the IRE (for iron-independent expression). They showed 4–6-fold increased accumulation of the H-Ft subunit, resulting from higher rates of H-Ft synthesis and repression of endogenous L-Ft levels. The total amount of Ft increased from 380 ng/mg of protein in control cells to 900–1200 ng/mg of protein in transfected cells, whereas the H:L subunit ratio rose from 1:1 in control cells to 4–20:1 in transfected cells. To assess the functional consequences of H-Ft overexpression, we had to overcome the problem associated with the determination of the LIP, whose chemical nature and physiological properties have remained largely elusive. This is particularly the case for highly differentiated erythroid cells, which utilize most of the transferrin-derived iron for mitochondrial heme synthesis, allegedly without a direct participation of the LIP (25Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Vyoral D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3477-3488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, most analytical assays previously used to assess the LIP have been applied to cell lysates rather than to intact cells (25Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Vyoral D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3477-3488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pollack S. Campana T. Blood. 1980; 56: 564-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nunez M.T. Cole E.S. Glass J. Blood. 1980; 55: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and they might have yielded “artifacts occurring during the homogenization process” and erroneous measures of “the original iron complexin vivo ” (28Jacobs A. Blood. 1977; 50: 433-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have therefore applied in this work a non-invasive method for continuous monitoring of the LIP in living cells using the metallosensing properties of a fluorescent chelator (19Breuer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24209-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20Epsztejn S. Kakhlon O. Glickstein H. Breuer W. Cabantchik I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In support of the previously observed activation of IRP and down-regulation of endogenous L-Ft expression (9Picard V. Renaudie F. Porcher C. Hentze M.W. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2057-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), H-Ft overexpression was shown here to reduce LIP levels, from 1.3 μm in control cells to 0.56 μm in the highest overexpressing clones. The cell LIP measurements were accurate within the ±0.1 μm Fe(II) range and therefore could not resolve minor differences between relatively poor H-Ft-expressing clones and wild-type cells. Nevertheless, the 2-fold increase in H-Ft levels in clone 16 gave consistently lower LIP levels than in the parent cells. In addition, in all the clones analyzed, there was a parallel reduction in LIP levels and endogenous L-Ft levels. These properties were also reflected in the iron-buffering capacity associated with H-Ft, both under resting conditions and following acute iron loads. However, despite the higher iron absorptive capacity and reduced LIP levels resulting from higher expression of H-Ft, the total amount of iron in the cells remained at a constant level of 350–400 mm (data not shown). Given the relatively high expression of H-Ft in some of the clones, those results indicate that a major fraction of ferritin might be iron-poor. The form of iron that is associated with H-Ft shortly after its entry into cells is apparently accessible to cell-permeant chelators, but its chemical properties remain to be elucidated. Such reversible association of the metal with H subunit-rich Ft might reflect a transitory state of the bound metal, which, in the absence of sufficient L subunits, might fail to mineralize (10Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). Thus, an apparent fine-tuning of H and L gene expression might be necessary for correct handling and processing of cell iron and appears to be a key factor in controlling the labile iron pool and IRP activity (Fig. 4). On the other hand, tissue accumulation of nonfunctional L-Ft homopolymers, which results from the presence of a mutation in the IRE of L-Ft mRNA in patients with hereditary hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome, has apparently limited pathological implications (29Beaumont C. Leneuve P. Devaux I. Scoazec J.Y. Berthier M. Loiseau M.N. Grandchamp B. Bonneau D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 444-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 30Girelli D. Corrocher R. Bisceglia L. Olivieri O. De Franceschi L. Zelante L. Gasparini P. Blood. 1995; 86: 4050-4053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these patients, the aberrant expression of L-Ft subunits affects the transparency of the lens with progressive onset of cataracts, but not the major parameters associated with intracellular iron metabolism. Finally, this study opens the possibility of manipulating ferritin levels independently of iron and of assessing the proposed roles of the LIP in controlling cellular functions, including regulation of gene expression and generation of reactive oxygen species."

The photolysis of bis-ANS-α-crystallin complex resulted in incorporation of the probe to both αA- and αB-subunits. Prior binding of denatured alcohol dehydrogenase to α-crystallin significantly decreased the photoincorporation of bis-ANS to α-crystallin. Localization of bis-ANS incorporated into αA-crystallin resulted in the identification of residues QSLFR and HFSPEDLTVK as the fluorophore binding regions. In αB-crystallin, sequences DRFSVNLNVK and VLGDVIEVHGK were found to be the bis-ANS binding regions. Of the bis-ANS binding sequences, HFSPEDLTVK of αA-crystallin and DRFSVNLNVK and VLGDVIEVHGK of αB-crystallin were earlier identified as part of the sequences involved in their interaction with target proteins during the molecular chaperone-like action. The hydrophobic probe, 1,5-AZNS, also interacted with both subunits of α-crystallin. Localization of 1,5-AZNS binding site in αB-crystallin lead to the identification of HFSPEEK sequence as the interacting site in this subunit of α-crystallin. Glycated α-crystallin displayed decreased ANS fluorescence and loss of chaperone-like function, suggesting the involvement of glycation site as well as ANS binding site in chaperone-like activity display.

In αB-crystallin, sequences DRFSVNLNVK and VLGDVIEVHGK were found to be the bis-ANS binding regions. Of the bis-ANS binding sequences, HFSPEDLTVK of αA-crystallin and DRFSVNLNVK and VLGDVIEVHGK of αB-crystallin were earlier identified as part of the sequences involved in their interaction with target proteins during the molecular chaperone-like action. The hydrophobic probe, 1,5-AZNS, also interacted with both subunits of α-crystallin. Localization of 1,5-AZNS binding site in αB-crystallin lead to the identification of HFSPEEK sequence as the interacting site in this subunit of α-crystallin. Glycated α-crystallin displayed decreased ANS fluorescence and loss of chaperone-like function, suggesting the involvement of glycation site as well as ANS binding site in chaperone-like activity display. α-Crystallin is one of the most predominant eye lens proteins. Its concentration in lens fiber cells is about 40% of the total protein in lens (1Bloemendal H. Bloemendal H. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 1-47Google Scholar). α-Crystallin exists as a polydisperse aggregate with an average molecular mass of 800 kDa (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The two types of subunits, designated αA and αB, each of which has a molecular mass of 20 kDa, arrange themselves in yet undefined ways to form the aggregate (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). During aging, α-crystallin undergoes extensive modifications culminating in the formation of super aggregates and highly cross-linked light-scattering molecules (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The sequences of the subunits of α-crystallin have high homology to small heat shock proteins (3Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar) and are highly conserved between species. α-Crystallin subunits, once thought to be lens-specific, are now widely known to be present in other tissues as well (5Bhat S.P.

Despite extensive studies carried out in the past, the quarternary structure or the structure-function of α-crystallin or its subunits has remained an enigma and challenge for researchers.

It has been proposed that surface hydrophobic sites in the α-crystallin aggregate are involved in the binding of α-crystallin to target proteins during the display of chaperone-like activity (13Raman B.

A direct correlation between the extent of α-crystallin hydrophobicity and chaperone-like activity has been demonstrated by several studies (13Raman B. Rao Ch. M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid sequence that contributes to the site responsible for the binding of denatured proteins and hydrophobic site specific probes is not fully understood. We have shown earlier that both A- and B-subunits in α-crystallin interact with bis-ANS 1The abbreviations used are: bis-ANS, 1,1′-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; 1,5-AZNS, 1-azidonaphthalene 5-sulfonate; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate; HSP, heat shock protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase. in 1:1 stoichiometry at 37 °C (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The number of bis-ANS molecules binding to α-crystallin increases if the protein is exposed to higher temperatures or denaturing agents prior to the addition of the fluorophore (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that binding of bis-ANS to αB-crystallin (25Smulders R.H.P.H. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or α-crystallin (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) diminishes the chaperone-like activity of the protein. In the present study we have determined the bis-ANS binding sequences in α-crystallin by photocross-linking, peptide mapping and sequencing. The data presented here also show that the bis-ANS binding sequences are also the chaperone sites in α-crystallin. bis-ANS, ANS, and 1,5-AZNS were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Junction City, OR). The stock solutions of bis-ANS were prepared in 95% alcohol, and the concentration was determined by absorbance at 385 nm using an extinction coefficient, ε385 = 16,790 cm−1m−1(28Sudhakar K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23015-23021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Lysyl endopeptidase was purchased from Wako Bioproducts. Sequence grade trypsin was obtained from Sigma. βL-crystallin (29Bloemendal M. Bloemendal H. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was isolated from bovine lenses (15Sharma K.K. Ortwerth B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. α-Crystallin was isolated from young bovine lens cortex by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and ion-exchange chromatography on trimethylaminoethyl-fractogel column (EM-Separations) as described earlier (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 30Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The α-crystallin thus obtained was >99% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE, and this preparation was used in this study. Photoincorporation of bis-ANS to α-crystallin was carried out as described earlier (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), with slight modification of the original procedure described by Seale et al. (31Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Following photolysis, the sample was analyzed by HPLC and SDS-PAGE, and the fluorescence associated with protein bands was documented by photography using TMAX 100 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) under UV light (360 nm). The gel was later stained with Coomassie Blue. The efficiency of bis-ANS incorporation to α-crystallin during 15-min photolysis was determined by quantitative densitometry function of Image-1 system (Universal Imaging Corp.). To investigate whether prior binding of denatured proteins to α-crystallin prevents bis-ANS binding and photoincorporation, α-crystallin and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (1:6 ratio) were incubated at 48 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, the reaction mixture was cooled to 25 °C, and bis-ANS was added. The final bis-ANS concentration was 12.5 μm. Photolysis of the sample was carried out as above for 15 min, and the aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The fluorescent bands were photographed as above and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. The photolyzed α-crystallin-bis-ANS complex was treated with 5 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h and filtered. The αA- and αB-subunits were separated from one another by HPLC using a C18 column (218TP1010 from The Separation Group, Hesparia, CA) and linear gradient (0–60% over a period of 1 h) formed between 0.065% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 0.065% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The elution was monitored by absorbance (280 nm) and fluorescence (390 nm excitation and 490 nm emission). bis-ANS-labeled αA- and αB-crystallins were further purified by SDS-PAGE and recovered by electroelution, and the SDS was removed by ether precipitation (32Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The bis-ANS-labeled αA- and αB-crystallins were digested with lysyl endopeptidase (1:30, enzyme/protein) for 4 h at 37 °C. The peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (218TP54) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 + 5% acetonitrile (solvent A). The elution of bound peptides was carried out with a linear gradient (0–60%) formed by solvent A and solvent B (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, in 95% acetonitrile). A flow rate of 1 ml/min over 120 min was maintained, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The elution was monitored at 220 nm for absorption and fluorescence (390 nm excitation and 490 nm emission). The amino-terminal sequences of bis-ANS-labeled peptides were determined by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems PROCISE CLC protein sequencing system. The photoincorporation of 1,5-AZNS to α-crystallin was accomplished using a procedure described by Dockter and Koseki (33Dockter M.E. Koseki T. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3954-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 1 mm1,5-AZNS and 1.25 μm α-crystallin were used in this study. Following photoincorporation, A- and B- subunits of α-crystallin were separated by HPLC as above using a C18 column. Although the fluorophore was incorporated to both the subunits, only αB-subunit was further analyzed to determine the 1,5-AZNS incorporation site. Labeled αB-crystallin was digested with sequencing grade trypsin (1:50 ratio), and the resulting peptides were separated as described earlier (30Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The elution profile was monitored at 220 nm. All fractions were tested for fluorescence in a Perkin-Elmer Spectrophotometer model 650-40 (excitation and emission maxima of 334 and 440 nm, respectively). The major fluorescent peptide eluting at 45 min from the HPLC column was subjected to amino acid sequencing in an Applied Biosystems 470A sequencer. Glycation of α-crystallin was carried out in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, using 10 mg/ml protein and 20 mml-ascorbic acid (34Prabhakaram M. Ortwerth B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C for 4 weeks, the reaction mixture was dialyzed, and the glycated protein was tested with βL-crystallin for chaperone-like activity (15Sharma K.K. Ortwerth B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The interaction of glycated α-crystallin (0.25 μm) with ANS was examined by fluorescence measurement in a Perkin-Elmer Spectrofluorimeter model 650–40. The samples with ANS were excited at 390 nm, and the emission was measured at 490 nm in a cuvette with 1-cm path length and slit width of 5 nm. The ratio of protein to probe was approximately 1:50. α-Crystallin incubated without ascorbic acid and processed similarly was used as the control. The binding of bis-ANS, the environment-sensitive probe, to α-crystallin results in severalfold increases in fluorescence intensity of the probe, and the emission maxima is blue shifted to ∼490 nm from its emission maximum of 533 nm in aqueous medium (27Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that bis-ANS interacts strongly with α-crystallin, and the bound fluorophore cannot be removed by dialysis (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Covalent bonds are formed between protein-bound bis-ANS and the amino acids forming the binding pocket when the complexes are exposed to long UV light (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The photoincorporation of bis-ANS to α-crystallin is directly proportional to the duration of photolysis. By image analysis we estimated that about 15% of the bound bis-ANS covalently cross-links to α-crystallin in the 15 min of photolysis used in our study (Fig. 1, lane 1). Although photolysis for longer durations results in higher amount of photoincorporation, there is increased subunit cross-linking and generation of high molecular weight species. Therefore the studies described here were limited to 15 min of photolysis. As α-crystallin-bis-ANS was dialyzed to remove the free bis-ANS prior to photolysis, it is unlikely that nonspecific incorporation of the fluorophore to α-crystallin occurred during our experiments with bis-ANS and α-crystallin. Earlier we showed that prior binding of bis-ANS to α-crystallin diminishes the chaperone-like activity of the protein (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To determine whether the binding of denaturing proteins to α-crystallin at the chaperone site can affect subsequent bis-ANS photoincorporation, α-crystallin and ADH (1: 6 ratio) were incubated at 48 °C for 1 h prior to the addition of bis-ANS and photolysis. SDS-PAGE of such an experiment is shown in Fig. 1. The result shows a significant decrease in photoincorporation of bis-ANS to α-crystallin when ADH was heat-denatured and allowed to bind to α-crystallin prior to the addition of the fluorophore (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 1). To determine the bis-ANS binding sites in α-crystallin, the fluorophore was initially allowed to bind to purified α-crystallin by the addition of saturating amounts of the probe and removal of the excess by dialysis to minimize nonspecific photoincorporation of free bis-ANS activated during photolysis. Photolysis of the α-crystallin-bis-ANS complex by UV-A light (366 nm) resulted in covalent incorporation of the fluorophore to both αA- and αB-subunits as we reported earlier (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In order to identify the sites of bis-ANS incorporation into αA- and αB-crystallins, α-crystallin was modified with bis-ANS, and the subunits were separated by HPLC and purified by SDS-PAGE. The purified bis-ANS-modified proteins were later digested with lysyl endopeptidase. The resulting fluorescent peptides were separated from other peptides by reverse phase HPLC. The HPLC profile of αA-crystallin peptides and the fluorescence is shown in Fig. 2. Edman degradation of fluorescent peptides eluting at 37 and 40 min revealed the same NH2-terminal sequence HFSPE. These peptides probably have the sequence HFSPEDLTVK and HFSPEDLTVKVQEDFVEIHGK, corresponding to residues 79–88 and 79–99 of αA-crystallin (Fig. 3), since we used lysyl endopeptidase to digest αA-crystallin. Incomplete digestion at Lys-88 due to the bis-ANS incorporation at/or near Lys-88 may have generated the latter peptide. Furthermore, the peptide eluting at 40 min yielded low levels of Phe (10 pmol) in the second cycle compared with 20 pmol of Ser in the third sequencing cycle, indicating that Phe-80 was modified by bis-ANS during photoincorporation. We could not determine the location of bis-ANS insertion site in peptide eluting at 37 min by examining the results of five sequence cycles used to determine the identity of the peptide.Figure 3αA- and αB-crystallin sequence showing the bis-ANS binding region. The bis-ANS binding sequences are shown in bold. The alcohol dehydrogenase binding sequences in αB-crystallin and mellitin binding sequence in αA-crystallin are taken from Refs. 30Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 40Sharma K.K. Kumar S.G. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (Abstr. 9): A908Google Scholar, respectively, and underlined. The mellitin binding region in αB-crystallin marked with adouble underline is taken from Ref. 40Sharma K.K. Kumar S.G. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (Abstr. 9): A908Google Scholar. The 1,5-AZNS binding sequence in αB-crystallin is shown in italics.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The fluorescent peptide eluting at 89 min showed the NH2-terminal sequence RTLGPF. The peptide showed a mobility equivalent to 6.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Therefore, the peptide eluting at 89 min is likely to represent the residues 12–70 of αA-crystallin. Analysis of the fluorescent material eluting at 72 min failed to show any amino acid during sequencing cycles. Since the same peak also did not contain appreciable 220 nm absorption, it is likely that the fluorescence at this region may be due to the peptide-bound unstable bis-ANS or its derivative. To localize the bis-ANS-bound amino acid in peptide eluting at 89 min (Fig. 2), the peptide was subjected to trypsin digestion and HPLC analysis. Fig. 2, inset, shows the HPLC profile of the trypsin digest. The single fluorescent peptide eluting at 66 min (Fig. 2, inset) was sequenced as described earlier. The observed sequence for the 66-min peptide, QSLFR, corresponds to residues 50–54 of αA-crystallin (Fig. 3). During the sequencing of this peptide the yield of Phe was low (82 pmol) compared with other amino acids (which were in the range of 110–160 pmol), suggesting a possible modification of Phe-53 in αA-crystallin by bis-ANS. The two fluorescent peptides of αB-crystallin, generated by lysyl endopeptidase digestion, eluted from the HPLC column at 38 min as a doublet (Fig. 4). The same peaks also showed maximal fluorescence emission at 490 nm when excited at 390 nm and revealed NH2-terminal sequence DRFSV and VLGDV. These two αB-peptides can only be from the sequence DRFSVNLDVK and VLGDVIEVHGK (Fig. 3), since we have used lysyl endopeptidase for digestion. We were unable to conclude which of the amino acid in αB-crystallin formed a cross-link with bis-ANS by examining the results from five cycles of sequencing reaction used to determine the identity of the fluorescence peptide. Although the fluorescent material eluting at 72 min was the largest fluorescent peak, it gave no amino acids during sequencing cycles. Since the same peak also did not contain measurable 220 nm absorption, it is likely that the fluorescence at this region may be due to the peptide-bound unstable bis-ANS or its derivative. Since the chemistry of the reaction is not known at the present time, further studies are required to see whether the 72-in fluorescent peak was due to the bis-ANS that was originally bound to the two peptides we have identified or to a different peptide. 1,5-AZNS is another, less specific, photoreactive agent used to study the hydrophobic sites in proteins (33Dockter M.E. Koseki T. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3954-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 35Stevens D.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 379-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When bovine α-crystallin was treated with 1 mm 1,5-AZNS at 25 °C and photolyzed, about ∼40 nmol of 1,5-AZNS was incorporated to each mole of α-crystallin (800 kDa), suggesting that on average there exists one 1,5-AZNS binding site per subunit of α-crystallin at 25 °C. Further analysis of 1,5-AZNS-α-crystallin by HPLC revealed that both αA- and αB-crystallins were labeled with 1,5-AZNS during the experiment (data not shown), as with bis-ANS (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The 1,5-AZNS binding site in αB-crystallin was determined by peptide mapping and sequencing of the fluorophore-containing peptide. A peptide eluting from C18 column at 45 min (Fig. 5) with a sequence HFSPEELK was found to have incorporated 1,5-AZNS. This sequence corresponds to residues 83–90 in bovine αB-crystallin (Fig. 3). Examination of the chromatographic profiles obtained during the sequencing of the fluorescent peptide showed that Asp in the peptide was modified by 1,5-AZNS during photolysis. Although αA-crystallin was also labeled with 1,5-AZNS, we did not analyze the sample further. Earlier studies have shown that glycation of α-crystallin reduces its chaperone-like activity (36Cherian M. Abraham E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was due to an alteration of the hydrophobic chaperone site in α-crystallin, we measured the interaction of glycated α-crystallin with hydrophobic probe ANS. ANS, like bis-ANS is a polarity-sensitive reagent. α-Crystallin glycated with ascorbate for 4 weeks showed a 25% decrease in its ability to increase ANS fluorescence compared with the controls. When the same glycated α-crystallin was tested with βL-crystallin in a heat denaturation assay (15Sharma K.K. Ortwerth B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a marked decrease in chaperone-like activity was observed (Fig. 6). The presence of surface hydrophobic sites on α-crystallin has been known for a number of years (2Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Since the demonstration of chaperone-like activity with α-crystallin (9Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar), considerable interest has been shown in the hydrophobic sites within α-crystallins as these sites have been implicated in the chaperone-like function of the protein (13Raman B.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic sites in α-crystallin and its subunits have been studied during recent years using probes such as ANS (37Sun T.-X. Das B.P. Liang J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), bis-ANS (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Das K.P. Surewicz W.K.

We have shown recently that UV photolysis of the α-crystallin-bound bis-ANS leads to photoincorporation of the fluorophore to the protein subunits similar to that seen with chaperone GroEL (31Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and HSP18.1 (38Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and αB-crystallin (25Smulders R.H.P.H. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Prior binding of denatured proteins to α-crystallin resulted in diminished photoincorporation of the fluorophore bis-ANS (Fig. 1, lane 2) compared with α-crystallin alone. Earlier we showed that prior binding of bis-ANS to α-crystallin partially suppresses its chaperone-like activity (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that both ADH and bis-ANS share common binding sites in α-crystallin. The sequence analysis of binding sites discussed below confirms this view. Similar sharing of bis-ANS binding site and denaturing protein binding site in heat shock protein 18.1 has been reported recently (38Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The role of hydrophobic sites and the amino acid residues that contribute to their makeup within the multimeric chaperone GroEL has been confirmed (31Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The available data show that the bis-ANS binding sequences are part of the chaperone sites in GroEL (31Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The bis-ANS binding sites in small heat shock proteins have also been identified (38Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), but the chaperone sites in those proteins are yet to be determined. The two bis-ANS binding sequences in αA-crystallin, HFSPEDLTVK and HFSPEDLTVKVQEDFVEIHGK (Fig. 3), in part represent the chaperone site we identified earlier (40Sharma K.K. Kumar S.G. FASEB J. 1997; 11 (Abstr. 9): A908Google Scholar). On the basis of deuterium exchange studies Smith et al. (41Smith J.B. Liu Y. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have also proposed that residues 72–75, in αA-crystallin, are a potential chaperone site. It should be noted that under the experimental conditions described here to determine bis-ANS binding sequences, other hydrophobic sequences in αA-crystallin, namely the residues 3–10, 27–37, or 130–145, did not label with bis-ANS. It is possible that those sequences may be buried inside the protein molecule. The only other sequence that was labeled with bis-ANS was QSLFR peptide. Although it is not a hydrophobic sequence by itself, the sequence can be interpreted as part of an extended hydrophobic region between residues 44 and 57 (Fig. 3). It should also be noted that none of the peptides arising from the COOH terminus of αA-crystallin were labeled with bis-ANS. Since a loss in chaperone activity of αA-crystallin has been correlated with COOH-terminal truncation (20Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 42Takemoto L. Emmons T. Horwitz J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and no bis-ANS binding site has been identified in that region, further studies are needed to determine the role of this region in chaperoning. The two regions in αB-crystallin identified as bis-ANS binding sequences are at the COOH-terminal domain (Fig. 3). This is in contrast with the recent report published by Smulders and de Jong (25Smulders R.H.P.H. de Jong W.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) on the photoincorporation of bis-ANS to recombinant rat αB-crystallin, where the authors observed incorporation of bis-ANS to the NH2-terminal domain of the protein. Since prior exposure of α-crystallin to urea can affect the bis-ANS binding (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), it is yet to be determined whether the bis-ANS binding to rat αB-crystallin was influenced by urea used during the isolation of the recombinant protein. Of the two bis-ANS binding sequences identified in αB-crystallin during the present study (Fig. 3), the FSVNLDVK portion of the DRFSVNLDVK sequence is the same as the mellitin binding sequence we determined by cross-linking studies, 2K. Krishna Sharma and G. S. Kumar, manuscript in preparation. and the VLGDVIEVHGK sequence is one of the alcohol dehydrogenase binding sites determined earlier (30Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The DRFSVNLDVK sequence follows the alcohol dehydrogenase interacting site in αB-crystallin reported by us earlier (30Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In a separate experiment we have determined that another hydrophobic site-specific probe, 1,5-AZNS, binds to αB-crystallin sequence 83–90. The 1,5-AZNS-labeled peptide is the sequence between the two bis-ANS binding sequences in αB-crystallin. The structural differences between bis-ANS and 1,5-AZNS may have contributed to the difference in the site of incorporation of these two probes to αB-crystallin. Nevertheless, both bind at the highly conserved region of the protein (3Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 4Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar). The two bis-ANS binding sequences in αB-crystallin are separated by 10 amino acids, which have a major in vitro glycation site (43Ortwerth B.J. Slight S.H. Prabhakaram M. Sun Y. Smith J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Glycation of α-crystallin decreases ANS binding. Glycation also reduces chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin (Fig. 6). The data from this study suggest that the glycation-induced loss of chaperone-like activity reported earlier (36Cherian M. Abraham E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) may be due to the modification of Lys residues 90 and 92 of αB-crystallin that may be part of the hydrophobic/chaperone site. The most hydrophobic region of αB-crystallin, residues 28–34, proposed as a potential chaperone site by deuterium exchange studies (39Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) was not labeled by bis-ANS during our study. The two bis-ANS binding sequences in αB-crystallin identified during the present study belong to a region of high homology between HSP18.1 and αB-crystallin (38Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that this region in HSP18.1 is the primary bis-ANS binding region (38Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). On the basis of these data it can be stated that the entire third exon sequence of αB-crystallin, which has a high degree of homology to other heat shock proteins (3Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), is responsible for its chaperone-like function. Although we estimated the binding of one bis-ANS molecule per subunit of α- crystallin (26Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S.G. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), in this study we see two sequences in each subunit as bis-ANS binding sites. The occurrence of two UV-sensitive anilinonaphthalene centers in bis-ANS and the activation of either one of the centers and insertion to the adjacent amino acid in the binding pocket may be the cause for the observation of two peptides as binding sites. Alternately, multiple conformation of α-crystallin subunits and their interaction with bis-ANS may result in labeling of more than one peptide sequence as a binding site. We thank Dr. B. J. Ortwerth for helpful discussions on this project and critically reading the manuscript."

The last three references, in correct numerical order, are: Full-Text PDF Open Access HSP100/Clp proteins are found in eubacteria, fungi, plants, and animals including man. They function in a wide variety of biological activities such as stress tolerance, proteolysis, DNA transposition, and gene regulation. These diverse activities involve a common biochemical mechanism, disassembling quaternary protein structures and aggregates (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). For example, the ClpA protein of Escherichia coli regulates the activity of the ClpP protease, promoting the hydrolysis of specific substrates by ClpP in response to ATP (2Katayama-Fujimura Y. Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4477-4485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hwang B.J. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro, in the presence of ClpP, ClpA promotes the degradation of RepA (the origin-binding protein of plasmid P1); but in the absence of ClpP, ClpA activates RepA for DNA binding by disassembling inactive dimers and releasing them in an active, monomeric form (4Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the function of ClpA in proteolysis is to alter the conformational state of its substrates so that they become accessible to the protease. The Hsp104 protein ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae is critical for survival after exposure to extreme temperatures (50 °C; Ref. 5Sanchez Y. Lindquist S.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) or high concentrations of ethanol (20%; Ref. 6Sanchez Y. Taulien J. Borkovich K.A. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These stresses cause protein denaturation, and recent work indicates that Hsp104 promotes survival by facilitating the resolubilization of heat-damaged, aggregated proteins (7Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 8Vogel J.L. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 306-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 1J. R. Glover and S. Lindquist, manuscript in preparation. Hsp104 also regulates the aggregation state of Sup35, the protein responsible for the prion-like inheritance of an extrachromosomal genetic element in yeast. Thus both ClpA and Hsp104 appear to utilize a similar mechanism for their widely divergent biological functions. There are two classes of HSP100 proteins, and these are divided into eight subfamilies comprising more than 70 members identified to date (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Hsp104 is a member of the B subfamily within class 1. The closestE. coli relative of Hsp104, ClpB, is a member of the same subfamily. It and many other members of this subfamily also function in thermotolerance (for review, see Ref. 1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The E. coli ClpA protein, too, is a class 1 protein but from a different subfamily. In biochemical terms, ClpA is currently the best characterized protein in this class. All class 1 HSP100 proteins contain two predicted nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) 2The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; WT, wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. separated by a middle region of variable size and flanked by amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions (1Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 9Gottesman S. Squires C. Pichersky E. Carrington M. Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Dalrymple B. Kuramitsu H. Shiroza T. Foster T. Clark W.P. Ross B. Squires C.L. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3513-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Both NBDs contain classical Walker-type consensus sequences for the P-loop (10Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar) that resemble those of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein and the P-type transporter families. Both NBD1 and NBD2 are highly conserved in all class 1 HSP100 proteins but, except for the few residues that constitute the nucleotide-binding consensus, NBD1 and NBD2 exhibit little homology to each other. For example, although ClpA and Hsp104 are from different subfamilies, they share 51% identity in NBD1 and 42% identity in NBD2, but NBD1 and NBD2 of Hsp104 itself share only 22% identity. This high degree of sequence conservation in each NBD, throughout all four subclasses of class 1 HSP100 proteins, has led to the assumption that the functional relationships between the domains would also be conserved. All class 1 HSP100 proteins tested assemble into homo-oligomers in the presence of adenine nucleotides (12Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Maurizi M.R. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 178-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Maurizi M.R.

Both ClpA and Hsp104 assemble into ring-shaped hexamers, as determined by cross-linking, sizing chromatography, and electron microscopy (13Maurizi M.R. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 178-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.-H.

Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In every case tested, ATP is required for efficient functioning of the HSP100/Clp proteins in vitro. Moreover, point mutations in the NBDs, constructed to interfere with ATP binding or hydrolysis, eliminate biological function in vivo (17Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzel J.D. Lindquist S. Nature. 1991; 353: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 18Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29537-29545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8087-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Elucidating the contributions of the two NBDs to oligomerization and ATP hydrolysis is therefore an important first step for deciphering the molecular mechanism by which class 1 HSP100/Clp proteins alter the conformational state of their substrates. For ClpA, two independent studies have addressed the contributions of the two NBDs to oligomerization and ATP hydrolysis. Both are in general agreement. One study concludes that NBD2 is not required for hexamer formation and that more than 50% of the basal ATPase activity is derived from NBD2 (18Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29537-29545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other study suggests that NBD1 is responsible for hexamer formation, whereas NBD2 is essential for ATP hydrolysis (19Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8087-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For Hsp104, we previously reported that a point mutation in NBD1 had little effect on oligomerization in vitro, whereas an analogous mutation in NBD2 strongly inhibited oligomerization (15Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a surprising contrast with results for ClpA. No characterization of the ATPase activity of wild-type Hsp104 and the effects of these NBD mutations on ATP hydrolysis has been presented. Here we present this characterization and examine the effects of environmental conditions relevant to the role of Hsp104 in stress tolerance on its ATPase activity. We also test the effects of additional NBD mutations on oligomerization and ATP hydrolysis. Mutations in the highly conserved residues of NBD2 exert stronger effects on oligomerization, whereas analogous mutations in NBD1 exert stronger effects on ATP hydrolysis, results that contrast with similar experiments in ClpA. The same relationship between NBD1 and NBD2 mutations was observed when ATP hydrolysis and oligomerization were examined in physiological ionic strength buffers and in the lower ionic strength buffer employed in ClpA studies. Thus, in agreement with work on ClpA, the two domains of Hsp104 have distinct biochemical characteristics. However, the ways in which similar mutations affect those characteristics are different in ClpA and Hsp104. The assumption that the sequence similarities in the NBD domains of ClpA and Hsp104 predicates an identical distribution of functions is reevaluated in the “Discussion.” Point mutations that changed amino acids in the ATP-binding domains were produced by site-directed mutagenesis, using single-stranded plasmid DNA encoding theHSP104 gene and the Muta-Gene M13 in vitroMutagenesis Kit (Bio-Rad). The G217V and G619V coding sequences were inserted into the pJC45 vector (gift of J. Clos, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany), derived from the pJC20 vector (20Clos J. Brandau S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) that contained a 10-histidine extension under control of the T7/lac promoter. To eliminate the possibility of extraneous mutations, K218T and K620T were produced in a modified version of theHSP104 gene, HSP104 R, containing nucleotide substitutions that introduced restriction sites (BamHI at −3, SacII at 1125, SalI at 1626, SpeI at 2128; the natural sites EagI at 568 and SacI at 2842 were also used so that unique sites occurred approximately every 500 base pairs) without changing the encoded amino acids or significantly altering codon usage. After mutagenesis, the segment containing the mutation was sequenced, excised, and inserted into an unmutagenized version ofHSP104 R. The K218T R andK620T R coding sequences were inserted behind the 6-histidine extension of the pET28a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) from which an encoded T7 epitope tag had been removed. Hsp104 was purified from yeast as described (15Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For purification from E. coli, proteins were produced using the T7 expression system (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W.

Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) for K218T and K620T and using BL21[DE3](pAPlacIQ) (20Clos J. Brandau S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) for the other mutants. Cells were grown to an A 595 of <0.4 and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h. Induced cells were collected by centrifugation, sonicated in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), and bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). After washing in buffer A, proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 220 mmimidazole, dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), and applied onto 5-ml DEAE columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein was eluted with a 50–300 mm KCl gradient in buffer B, dialyzed against buffer B containing 10% glycerol (storage buffer), and either frozen for long term storage or used immediately. WT, K218T, and K620T proteins were diluted to equal concentrations in the storage buffer to equalize potential inhibition by glycerol and in most assays were diluted into buffer at least 10-fold. In comparing the wider range of mutants, all proteins (including WT, K218T, and K620T) were first dialyzed against and concentrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mmKCl, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol using Ultrafree-15 Centrifugal Filter Devices with a nominal molecular mass limit of 30,000 Da (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Concentrated proteins were diluted to equivalent concentrations with the same buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Subsequently, an extinction coefficient was calculated for Hsp104 (A 276, ε = 31,900 m−1 cm−1) that did not vary with native or denatured protein (24Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar) and matched data from amino acid analysis but yielded lower values than the Bradford assay which overestimates Hsp104 protein concentration by a factor of ∼2. Remaining frozen stocks of some proteins were analyzed using this extinction coefficient and the others extrapolated for the values given herein. Previously published work on Hsp104 utilized the Bradford assay standardized against bovine serum albumin, so values therein are overestimated. General characterization of Hsp104 ATPase activity (Tables Table I, Table II, Table III and Fig. 1) was performed in reaction buffer 1 (40 mm Tris adjusted to pH 7.5 at 37 °C, 175 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100, and 5 mm ATP). For measurement of the ATPase activity at different pH values, 40 mm sodium acetate buffer was used for pH 4.5–6.0, 40 mm MOPS for pH 6.5–7.0, 40 mm Tris for pH 7.0–9.0, and 40 mmglycine-NaOH buffer for pH 9.5–10.5. Hsp104 was at a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml with a 7-min end point for all general characterization assays.Table IThe ability of other cations to replace Mg2+ in supporting ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104IonHsp104Hsp104a% of activity with Mg2+.ClpA %bHwang et al.

Only ATP was hydrolyzed by Hsp104 at a significant level. Hydrolysis of ATP (5 mm) was examined in the presence of other nucleotides (each also at 5 mm). ADP inhibited ATP hydrolysis by Hsp104 7-fold. To relate oligomerization to ATP hydrolysis, assays comparing different mutant proteins and all K m experiments were performed in the same buffer employed in oligomerization experiments, reaction buffer 2 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mmKCl, 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2).K m and V max were identical whether assayed in reaction buffer 1 or 2, but HEPES buffer was employed because Tris buffer inhibits glutaraldehyde cross-linking. All reactions contained 5 mm ATP, pH 7.5, except forK m experiments where ATP concentration was varied. The reaction buffer for K m experiments included 5 mm MgCl2, and ATP was resuspended with equimolar MgCl2. All nucleotides were adjusted to pH 7.5 prior to ATPase assays. Experiments using low ionic strength buffers were performed in reaction buffer 3 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Triton X-100) or reaction buffer 2 minus salt. All assays were performed at 37 °C in a 25-μl reaction volume in siliconized Eppendorf tubes so that Triton X-100 (used in reaction buffer 1 to reduce loss of proteins on the walls of reaction tubes) could be eliminated; this detergent slightly stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsp104. Reactions were terminated and released Pi quantified by the addition of 800 μl of Malachite Green Reagent (0.034% Malachite Green, catalog number M9636, Sigma; 1.05% ammonium molybdate; 1 m HCl, filtered to remove insoluble material; Ref. 25Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.V. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). After 1 min at room temperature, color development was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 34% citric acid. 200 μl of the sample was removed to 96-well assay plates andA 650 determined with a Molecular Devices (Palo Alto, CA) vmax kinetic microplate reader with SoftMaxTMsoftware. Values were calibrated against KH2PO4standards and corrected for phosphate released in the absence of Hsp104. For each point at least 3 and typically 6 independent assays were used to calculate the mean ± S.D. Curves were generated using least squares fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation with the KaleidagraphTM graphics program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). K m and V max were calculated using the Kaleidagraph program, and similar values were also obtained using Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee plots. WT and mutant proteins dialyzed against reaction buffer 2 with 2 mm dithiothreitol were cleared of aggregated protein by centrifugation and adjusted to 0.01 mg/ml in reaction buffer 2 containing dithiothreitol (2 mm) with or without ATP (5 mm). 200-μl reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, glutaraldehyde added (final concentration 0.01%), and cross-linking terminated at 0 or 12 min with 1 m glycine as described (15Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction buffer 2 lacking KCl and NaCl was employed for cross-linking reactions at low ionic strengths. First, we characterized the ATPase activity of WT Hsp104 using a colorimetric assay to measure phosphate released. ATP hydrolysis required divalent cations. Hydrolysis was supported by Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ but not by Ca2+, which supports hydrolysis by ClpA and ClpB (3Hwang B.J. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). Surprisingly, hydrolysis in the presence of 5 mm CoCl2 was 4-fold higher than with 5 mm MgCl2. Although the closestE. coli homolog of Hsp104, ClpB, is reported to hydrolyze other nucleotides (12Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Table II), Hsp104 did not hydrolyze other nucleotides at a significant rate (Table II). GTP, CTP, and UTP moderately inhibited the ATPase activity of Hsp104, whereas AMP inhibited it only slightly. ADP, however, inhibited the ATPase activity of Hsp104 strongly (TableIII). Because Hsp104 promotes survival after exposure to extreme stresses (high temperatures or high concentrations of ethanol) and because the functions of both nucleotide-binding sites are required for stress tolerance (17Parsell D.A. Sanchez Y. Stitzel J.D. Lindquist S. Nature. 1991; 353: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of heat and ethanol on the ATPase activity of Hsp104 in vitro (Fig. 1). Initially, as temperature increased, Hsp104 ATPase activity increased. However, this increase was no greater than expected for a typical enzyme system; for every 10 °C increase in temperature, activity roughly doubled. At temperatures above 45 °C, activity dropped precipitously (Fig. 1 A). Ethanol inhibited ATPase activity at all concentrations tested, eliminating it at a concentration of 20% (Fig. 1 B). Because the intracellular pH of yeast cells drops during heat stress (26Weitzel G. Pilatus U. Rensing L. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 170: 64-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we also tested the ATPase activity of Hsp104 at different pH values (Fig. 1 C). Hsp104 hydrolyzed ATP between pH 5 and 10. Within this range, the nadir for ATPase activity occurred at physiological pH (7.5). Maximal activity occurred at pH 6.5 (200% of the activity at pH 7.5); a second optima was observed at pH 9.0 (150% of the activity at pH 7.5). Hsp104 exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics over an ATP concentration range of 0.5 to 30 mm. (Deviations from Michaelis-Menten kinetics occurred at nucleotide concentrations lower than 0.5 mm.) 3E. C. Schirmer and S. Lindquist, unpublished results. Between 0.5 and 30 mm ATP (pH 7.5, 37 °C, physiological salt), Hsp104 hydrolyzed ATP with a K m of ∼5 mm and a V max of ∼2 nmol of Pi min−1 μg−1 (Fig. 2). This corresponds to a turnover rate of ∼20 ATP molecules per hexamer of Hsp104 per s. Given that the two nucleotide-binding domains of Hsp104 have very different sequences, if hydrolysis at both sites makes a substantial contribution to phosphate released, a plot of V versus ATP concentration might be expected to yield a biphasic (sigmoidal) curve. This was not observed. It is possible that both domains contribute to ATP hydrolysis over this range of ATP concentrations but that the two NBDs, although very different in primary amino acid sequence, have very similar affinities for ATP. Alternatively, one of the two domains may contribute most of the ATP hydrolysis activity of the protein. To investigate the relative contributions of each nucleotide-binding site to ATP hydrolysis, we examined the effects of point mutations in nucleotide-binding consensus residues (Fig. 3 A). One matching set of mutants, K218T and K620T, carried threonine substitutions in the conserved lysine that interacts directly with the β- and γ- phosphates of bound nucleotide and is important for the structure of the P-loop in other nucleotide-binding proteins with Walker consensus motifs (27Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Separately, matching glycine to valine substitutions (G217V,G619V) were generated in the conserved glycines immediately preceding these lysines. All of these residues are absolutely conserved in both the Walker A P-loop consensus ((G/A)X 4GK(T/S)) (10Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar, 27Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) and in the more specific HSP100 family consensus (GX 2GX GKT) of both NBDs. When proteins carrying the lysine to threonine substitutions were expressed in yeast cells, they were no more susceptible to proteolysis than WT Hsp104, suggesting the mutations caused no global perturbation in structure (15Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the circular dichroism spectra of both the K218T and the K620T mutants were very similar to WT protein, also indicating no gross loss of structure in the mutants (data not shown). To simplify purification procedures, HSP104 coding sequences were cloned into expression vectors encoding amino-terminal histidine extensions, and the proteins were purified from E. coli by chromatography on nickel resin, followed by chromatography on DEAE. Histidine-tagged Hsp104 provided wild-type levels of thermotolerance when expressed in a yeast hsp104 deletion strain. 4D. A. Parsell and S. Lindquist, unpublished observations. Moreover, the ATPase activity and oligomerization properties of the WT protein purified from yeast (15Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were very similar to those of the protein purified fromE. coli, whether the histidine residues remained attached or were cleaved from the protein wi"
https://openalex.org/W2022842129,"C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is a newly discovered factor that stimulates vasorelaxation and inhibits cell proliferation. Natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) is the primary signaling molecule for CNP. Recently, the guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR-B was shown to correlate with its phosphorylation state, and it was suggested that receptor dephosphorylation is a mechanism of desensitization. We now report the identification and characterization of the major NPR-B phosphorylation sites. Mutagenesis and comigration studies using synthetic phosphopeptides were employed to identify five residues (Ser-513, Thr-516, Ser-518, Ser-523, and Ser-526) within the kinase homology domain that are phosphorylated when NPR-B is expressed in human 293 cells. Mutation of any of these residues to alanine reduced the receptor's phosphorylation state and CNP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity. The reductions were not explained by decreases in receptor protein level as indicated by immunoblot analysis and determinations of cyclase activity in the absence of CNP or in the presence of detergent. Elimination of all of the phosphorylation sites resulted in a completely dephosphorylated receptor whose CNP-dependent cyclase activity was decreased by >90%. However, unlike NPR-A, the dephosphorylated receptor was not completely unresponsive to hormone. Finally, two additional residues (Gly-521 and Ser-522) were identified that when mutated to alanine reduced the overall phosphorylation state and hormone responsiveness of the receptor without abolishing the phosphorylation of a specific site. These data indicate that phosphorylation of the kinase homology domain is a critical event in the regulation of NPR-B.

ANP and BNP are stored primarily in the cardiac atria and ventricles, respectively, and are released into the circulation upon an increase in cardiac volume (1Brenner B.M. Ballermann B.J.

Commun. 1990; 168: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). It does not seem to be stored in significant quantities. Instead, it appears to be regulated at the level of transcription by various cytokines, such as TGF-β (4Suga S. Nakao K. Itoh H. Komatsu Y. Ogawa Y. Hama N. Imura H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The physiological responses elicited by these natriuretic peptides are similar but not identical. For instance, all three have been shown to cause vascular relaxation, but although both ANP and BNP have been shown to cause diuresis and natriuresis, CNP's role in these processes is dubious. Likewise, both ANP and CNP have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various cell types (7Appel R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F911-F918PubMed Google Scholar, 8Furuya M. Yoshida M. Hayashi Y.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The cognate signaling receptor for ANP and BNP is the natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A), which is also known as guanylyl cyclase A (13Chinkers M.

Garbers D.L. Goeddel D.V. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The primary signaling receptor for CNP is the natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR-B), which is also known as guanylyl cyclase B (15Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Lewis M. Hellmiss R. Chen E. Goeddel D.V.

Cell. 1989; 58: 1155-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). NPR-A and NPR-B are approximately 40 and 78% identical within their extracellular and intracellular regions, respectively (16Schulz S. Singh S. Bellet R.A. Singh G. Tubb D.J. Chin H. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 1155-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Motifs present in the primary amino acid sequence of both NPR-A and NPR-B suggest that they contain five primary functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single membrane-spanning region, a juxtamembrane protein kinase homology domain (KHD), an α-helical hinge region involved in oligomerization (17Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and a carboxyl-terminal guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain (18Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol.

Maximal activation of these receptors is thought to require ligand binding extracellularly and ATP binding intracellularly (20Kurose H. Inagami T. Ui M.

Within the KHD of NPR-A is the sequence GXGXXXG, which is similar to the known ATP-binding motif GXGXXG found in many protein kinases (26Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). Sharma and colleagues (27Goraczniak R.M. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Biochem.

They have reported that the mutation of some but not all of the residues within the ATP-regulatory module region dramatically reduces hormone-dependent activation of these receptors. The mechanism for this effect has not been demonstrated, but it has been speculated that it is a result of the disruption of the putative ATP-binding domain.Both NPR-A and NPR-B are known to be phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in unstimulated cells (29Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5997-6003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding to their cognate hormone, the guanylyl cyclase activity of these receptors is markedly enhanced, resulting in dramatic elevations in intracellular cGMP concentrations. After the initial stimulation, the activity of these enzymes decreases with kinetics that are coincident with receptor dephosphorylation (29Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Potter L.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that dephosphorylation mediates their desensitization. We recently, identified six phosphorylation sites within the KHD of NPR-A (33Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As was predicted from the desensitization studies, the mutation of these sites to alanine dramatically decreased the ANP-dependent activity of NPR-A. Furthermore, the conversion of four or more of the phosphorylation sites to alanine resulted in an hormonally unresponsive receptor. In this report, we describe the identification of fivein vivo phosphorylation sites for NPR-B. The evidence for these sites is based primarily on deletion and site-specific mutagenesis studies. However, for two of the sites we were able to show comigration with synthetic phosphopeptides. Four of the five sites correspond to residues present in NPR-A, and the additional site is only one amino acid carboxyl-terminal to a known NPR-A site. All of the single phosphorylation site mutations decreased CNP-dependent activity, and a completely dephosphorylated form of NPR-B retained less than 10% of its wild type activity. Finally, we show that a previously described inactivating mutation within the so called ATP-regulatory module of NPR-B (G521A) also results in receptor dephosphorylation, suggesting that dephosphorylation may explain the functional consequence of this mutation as well.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe the identification and characterization of five phosphorylated residues located in the putative ATP-binding portion of the KHD of NPR-B. The data for these conclusions are based on a number of experiments including: deletion mutagenesis (33Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), single site mutagenesis, and comigration studies involving synthetic phosphopeptides. The experiments involving the comigration of synthetic phosphopeptides with tryptic phosphopeptides of NPR-B isolated from 32P-labeled cells provide strong evidence for the phosphorylation of Thr-516 and Ser-518. Furthermore, the high correlation of the mutagenesis data with the predicted phosphopeptide maps together with the corroborating phosphoamino acid analysis, make a very strong case for the correct identification all five sites.Although most of the NPR-A phosphorylation sites were conserved in NPR-B, we were unable to find conclusive evidence for the phosphorylation of Thr-529. Mutation of the corresponding residue in NPR-A, Thr-513, was shown to decrease the phosphorylation state and change the tryptic phosphopeptide maps of this receptor, whereas mutation of Thr-529 to alanine in NPR-B had little or no effect. However, because phosphoamino acid analysis of peptides that are predicted to contain this residue revealed the presence of low levels of phosphothreonine, we cannot rule out the possibility that Thr-529 may be a minor phosphorylation site. Furthermore, the replacement of this residue with alanine resulted in CNP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities that were similar to those observed for the S513A, T516A, S518A, and S522A mutations. Whether the reduction associated with the T529A mutant is because of the loss of a specific phosphorylation site or is simply because of structural differences between the threonine and alanine residues is not known. It is also interesting that Ser-522 does not appear to be phosphorylated in NPR-B, because the corresponding residue in NPR-A (Ser-506) has been shown to be a major site. It is possible that the function of this residue is subserved by the adjacent residue, Ser-523, which lacks a counterpart in NPR-A. Regardless of its phosphorylation state, the structural characteristics of this residue appear to be important for maximal phosphorylation of the known sites, because the conservative mutation of this residue to alanine reduced the overall phosphorylation state of the receptor (Fig. 4). In a like manner, the mutation of glycine 521 to alanine also resulted in a decrease in the phosphorylation state of NPR-B without abolishing the phosphorylation of a specific site (Fig. 7). The structural characteristics of these amino acids are likely to be critical for the function of this region, because the sequence RGSSYGSL is absolutely conserved in all the NPR-B molecules identified to date, including humans, rats, cows, and eels (15Chang M.S.

Commun. 1995; 209: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that the GXGXXXG region in NPR-A and the corresponding region in NPR-B function as ATP-binding modules. The primary evidence for these claims is: (i) A similar motif (GXGXXG) is found in many, but not all, known protein kinases; (ii) ATP is required for maximal activation of these enzymes; (iii) ATP appears to exert its effects on highly purified preparations of NPR-A; and (iv) mutagenesis of the conserved glycines within this region reduce the ability of these receptors to be stimulated by ligands. Specifically, the mutation of glycine 505 and serine 506 to alanine and valine, respectively, in NPR-A, and the mutation of glycine 521 to alanine in NPR-B were found to reduce hormone-stimulated activity. In contrast, when Koller et al. (32Koller K.J. Lipari M.T. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5997-6003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mutated all three of the glycines in the putative ATP-binding domain to alanine in NPR-A, they found very little or no effect on the ability of this mutant to be phosphorylated or hormonally activated. This suggests that the conversion of glycine 505 to alanine is not sufficient to mediate this inhibition. Because we now know that Ser-506 is a major phosphorylation site of NPR-A, it is more likely that the removal of this site is responsible for the inactivity. With respect to the glycine 521 to alanine mutation in NPR-B, the effect of this mutation may also be related to the receptor dephosphorylation. But, instead of inhibiting the phosphorylation of a specific site, it appears to causes a global dephosphorylation of the receptor, possibly by making the KHD of NPR-B a less desirable substrate for its protein kinase. Finally, it should be noted that although we have identified five phosphorylation sites within NPR-B, we have not determined the exact stoichiometry of phosphorylation. It is likely that this receptor is multiply phosphorylated in these cells as evidenced by the presence of peptides containing more than one phosphate group. However, the fraction of the total cellular NPR-B pool that is phosphorylated has not yet been determined.In conclusion, we have presented evidence for the correct identification and characterization of the major phosphorylation sites of NPR-B. These data are consistent with our previous report, which suggested that NPR-B is desensitized by dephosphorylation (31Potter L.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have now extended our molecular understanding of this process by determining the exact location of the phosphorylated residues. Because the selective removal of these sites via site-directed mutagenesis mimics the effect of phosphatase treatment on NPR-B in crude membranes, it appears likely that dephosphorylation of only NPR-B is sufficient to inhibit its ability to respond to hormone. Now that these sites are known, the role of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in the regulation of this receptor can be further addressed. It will be interesting to determine whether or not the removal of specific sites can abrogate the protein kinase C-mediated heterologous desensitization response. Likewise, the effect of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on hormone binding and receptor trafficking and can now be effectively investigated using receptor mutants. The natriuretic peptide family consists of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), 1The abbreviations used are: ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; CNP, C-type natriuretic peptide; BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; HEK, human embryonic kidney; KHD, kinase homology domain; NPR-A, natriuretic peptide receptor A; NPR-B, natriuretic peptide receptor B; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid; TPCK,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; CNP, C-type natriuretic peptide; BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; HEK, human embryonic kidney; KHD, kinase homology domain; NPR-A, natriuretic peptide receptor A; NPR-B, natriuretic peptide receptor B; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid; TPCK,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) (1Brenner B.M. Ballermann B.J. Gunning M.E. Zeidel M.L. Physiol.

Invest. 1995; 25: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ANP and BNP are stored primarily in the cardiac atria and ventricles, respectively, and are released into the circulation upon an increase in cardiac volume (1Brenner B.M. Ballermann B.J. Gunning M.E. Zeidel M.L. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 665-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 2Ruskoaho H. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 479-602PubMed Google Scholar, 3McDowell G. Shaw C. Buchanan K.D. Nicholls D.P. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CNP on the other hand, is found primarily in vascular endothelial cells (4Suga S. Nakao K. Itoh H. Komatsu Y. Ogawa Y. Hama N. Imura H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), seminal plasma (5Chrisman T.D. Schulz S. Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3698-3703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and brain tissue (6Sudoh T. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). It does not seem to be stored in significant quantities. Instead, it appears to be regulated at the level of transcription by various cytokines, such as TGF-β (4Suga S. Nakao K. Itoh H. Komatsu Y. Ogawa Y. Hama N. Imura H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The physiological responses elicited by these natriuretic peptides are similar but not identical. For instance, all three have been shown to cause vascular relaxation, but although both ANP and BNP have been shown to cause diuresis and natriuresis, CNP's role in these processes is dubious. Likewise, both ANP and CNP have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various cell types (7Appel R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F911-F918PubMed Google Scholar, 8Furuya M. Yoshida M. Hayashi Y.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cognate signaling receptor for ANP and BNP is the natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A), which is also known as guanylyl cyclase A (13Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Chin H.M.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The primary signaling receptor for CNP is the natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR-B), which is also known as guanylyl cyclase B (15Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Lewis M. Hellmiss R. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1989; 341: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 16Schulz S. Singh S. Bellet R.A. Singh G. Tubb D.J. Chin H. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 1155-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). NPR-A and NPR-B are approximately 40 and 78% identical within their extracellular and intracellular regions, respectively (16Schulz S. Singh S. Bellet R.A. Singh G. Tubb D.J. Chin H. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 1155-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Motifs present in the primary amino acid sequence of both NPR-A and NPR-B suggest that they contain five primary functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single membrane-spanning region, a juxtamembrane protein kinase homology domain (KHD), an α-helical hinge region involved in oligomerization (17Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and a carboxyl-terminal guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain (18Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol.

Maximal activation of these receptors is thought to require ligand binding extracellularly and ATP binding intracellularly (20Kurose H. Inagami T. Ui M.

Specifically, the mutation of glycine 505 and serine 506 to alanine and valine, respectively, in NPR-A, and the mutation of glycine 521 to alanine in NPR-B were found to reduce hormone-stimulated activity. In contrast, when Koller et al. (32Koller K.J. Lipari M.T. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5997-6003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mutated all three of the glycines in the putative ATP-binding domain to alanine in NPR-A, they found very little or no effect on the ability of this mutant to be phosphorylated or hormonally activated. This suggests that the conversion of glycine 505 to alanine is not sufficient to mediate this inhibition. Because we now know that Ser-506 is a major phosphorylation site of NPR-A, it is more likely that the removal of this site is responsible for the inactivity. With respect to the glycine 521 to alanine mutation in NPR-B, the effect of this mutation may also be related to the receptor dephosphorylation. But, instead of inhibiting the phosphorylation of a specific site, it appears to causes a global dephosphorylation of the receptor, possibly by making the KHD of NPR-B a less desirable substrate for its protein kinase. Finally, it should be noted that although we have identified five phosphorylation sites within NPR-B, we have not determined the exact stoichiometry of phosphorylation. It is likely that this receptor is multiply phosphorylated in these cells as evidenced by the presence of peptides containing more than one phosphate group. However, the fraction of the total cellular NPR-B pool that is phosphorylated has not yet been determined.In conclusion, we have presented evidence for the correct identification and characterization of the major phosphorylation sites of NPR-B. These data are consistent with our previous report, which suggested that NPR-B is desensitized by dephosphorylation (31Potter L.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have now extended our molecular understanding of this process by determining the exact location of the phosphorylated residues. Because the selective removal of these sites via site-directed mutagenesis mimics the effect of phosphatase treatment on NPR-B in crude membranes, it appears likely that dephosphorylation of only NPR-B is sufficient to inhibit its ability to respond to hormone. Now that these sites are known, the role of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in the regulation of this receptor can be further addressed. It will be interesting to determine whether or not the removal of specific sites can abrogate the protein kinase C-mediated heterologous desensitization response. Likewise, the effect of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on hormone binding and receptor trafficking and can now be effectively investigated using receptor mutants. In this report, we describe the identification and characterization of five phosphorylated residues located in the putative ATP-binding portion of the KHD of NPR-B. The data for these conclusions are based on a number of experiments including: deletion mutagenesis (33Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), single site mutagenesis, and comigration studies involving synthetic phosphopeptides. The experiments involving the comigration of synthetic phosphopeptides with tryptic phosphopeptides of NPR-B isolated from 32P-labeled cells provide strong evidence for the phosphorylation of Thr-516 and Ser-518. Furthermore, the high correlation of the mutagenesis data with the predicted phosphopeptide maps together with the corroborating phosphoamino acid analysis, make a very strong case for the correct identification all five sites. Although most of the NPR-A phosphorylation sites were conserved in NPR-B, we were unable to find conclusive evidence for the phosphorylation of Thr-529. Mutation of the corresponding residue in NPR-A, Thr-513, was shown to decrease the phosphorylation state and change the tryptic phosphopeptide maps of this receptor, whereas mutation of Thr-529 to alanine in NPR-B had little or no effect. However, because phosphoamino acid analysis of peptides that are predicted to contain this residue revealed the presence of low levels of phosphothreonine, we cannot rule out the possibility that Thr-529 may be a minor phosphorylation site. Furthermore, the replacement of this residue with alanine resulted in CNP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities that were similar to those observed for the S513A, T516A, S518A, and S522A mutations. Whether the reduction associated with the T529A mutant is because of the loss of a specific phosphorylation site or is simply because of structural differences between the threonine and alanine residues is not known. It is also interesting that Ser-522 does not appear to be phosphorylated in NPR-B, because the corresponding residue in NPR-A (Ser-506) has been shown to be a major site. It is possible that the function of this residue is subserved by the adjacent residue, Ser-523, which lacks a counterpart in NPR-A. Regardless of its phosphorylation state, the structural characteristics of this residue appear to be important for maximal phosphorylation of the known sites, because the conservative mutation of this residue to alanine reduced the overall phosphorylation state of the receptor (Fig. 4). In a like manner, the mutation of glycine 521 to alanine also resulted in a decrease in the phosphorylation state of NPR-B without abolishing the phosphorylation of a specific site (Fig. 7). The structural characteristics of these amino acids are likely to be critical for the function of this region, because the sequence RGSSYGSL is absolutely conserved in all the NPR-B molecules identified to date, including humans, rats, cows, and eels (15Chang M.S.

Open table in a new tab The nAChRs are a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that is classified into muscle and multiple neuronal subtypes (13Chiappinelli V.A. Harvey A.L. Natural and Synthetic Neurotoxins. Academic Press, London1993: 65-128Google Scholar). The physiological and pharmacological heterogeneity of neuronal nAChRs is reflected by the diversity of subunit composition of these heteropentameric ion channel complexes (14Kulak J.M. Nguyen T.A. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5263-5270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Albuquerque E.X. Alkondon M. Pereira E.F.R. Castro N.G. Schrattenholz A. Barbosa C.T.F. Bonfante-Cabarcas R. Aracava Y. Eisenberg H.M. Maelicke A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1117-1136PubMed Google Scholar). Neuronal receptors are composed of several possible α subtypes (α2–α7, α9) and 3 possible β subtypes (β2–β4), whereas muscle receptors are composed of five subunits α12βεδ or α12βγδ in mature or embryonic tissue, respectively (13Chiappinelli V.A. Harvey A.L. Natural and Synthetic Neurotoxins. Academic Press, London1993: 65-128Google Scholar). Neuronal nAChRs are distributed in numerous brain regions and on both cell soma and dendrites, but it is the action of nAChRs to modulate synaptic transmission presynaptically that has received much attention recently (14Kulak J.M. Nguyen T.A. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5263-5270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wonnacott S.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5798-5806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Selective activation of distinct subtypes of these presynaptic nAChRs by nicotinic agonists can regulate the release of different neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine (14Kulak J.M. Nguyen T.A. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5263-5270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To gain a better insight into the role of the various nAChR subtypes in neurotransmission, additional selective nAChR antagonists are required. In this report we describe EpI, a novel conotoxin from the molluscivorous C. episcopatus that targets the nAChR. The peptide has the cysteine framework typical of α-conotoxins and substantial sequence homology with the other α-conotoxins isolated from non-piscivorous Conus species (see Table I). However, EpI differs from all previously reported α-conotoxins in that it possesses a sulfotyrosine residue. Five specimens of C. episcopatus (Fig. 1) were collected from The Great Barrier Reef, Australia, dissected and an extract of crude venom prepared from the pooled venom duct material as described previously (18Lewis R. Alewood P.F. Dooley M. Martin J.L. Drinkwater R.D. Craik D.J. Andrews P.R. Today's Life Sci. 1996; 8: 16-24Google Scholar). Briefly, ground dried ducts were extracted with 30% acetonitrile/water acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, centrifuged, and the supernatants lyophilized (yield 84 mg) and stored at −20 °C prior to HPLC separation. Crude venom (4.4 mg) was fractionated by preparative reversed-phase HPLC (Waters) using a 10-μm Vydac C18 column (1.0 × 25 cm) eluted at 2.5 ml/min with a linear gradient from 0 to 80% B over 80 min: solvent A, 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 90% acetonitrile, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid. Absorbance was monitored at 214 and 280 nm. A major peak eluting at ∼20 min was further purified by analytical reversed-phase HPLC using a 5-μm Vydac C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0 to 50% B over 45 and 90 min. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. A sample of approximately 100 pmol of purified native peptide was fully reduced in the presence of 50 mm dithiothreitol and 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 1 h, then alkylated in the presence of 100 mm 4-vinylpyridine for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The alkylated peptide was repurified by HPLC and analyzed by Edman chemistry on an ABI model 470A protein sequencer. A hydrolysate of EpI was prepared by carboxypeptidase Y digestion. Briefly, a sample of ∼2 nmol of native EpI was dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, and treated with 0.75 μg of carboxypeptidase Y (Boehringer Mannheim, sequencing grade) for 24 h at room temperature (enzyme to protein ratio ∼ 1:5). The products of the enzymatic degradation were assessed by analytical C18 HPLC, mass spectrometry (MS), and amino acid analysis. Sulfated Fmoc-Tyr was treated overnight in mild sodium hydroxide. The reaction mixture was purified on a 5 μm Vydac C18reversed-phase column (0.46 × 25 cm). With a standard gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile, sulfated tyrosine eluted cleanly in the solvent front, while the remaining reaction products were retained on a C18 column. Purity of the sulfated tyrosine (262 Da) was confirmed by MS. The free amino acids liberated from the digested peptide and amino acid standards were derivatized with PITC (19Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J. Chromatog. 1984; 336: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). The digests and standards were redried after addition of 40 μl of ethanol/water/triethylamine (2:2:1). The derivatization reagent consisted of ethanol/triethylamine/water/PITC (7:1:1:1) which was made fresh daily. The dried samples were resolubilized with 40 μl of derivatization reagent and the sealed samples allowed to react for 30 min before drying under vacuum. Derivatized amino acids were separated on a Pico-Tag column (Waters) using a linear gradient from 0% B to 46% B over 18 min: solvent A, 0.14 m sodium acetate containing 0.05% (v/v) triethylamine and adjusted to pH 6.35 with glacial acetic acid; solvent B, 60% acetonitrile/water. Mass spectra were acquired on a PE-SCIEX API 111 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-SCIEX, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an ion spray atmospheric pressure ionization source. Samples (20 μl) were injected into a moving solvent (10 μl/min; 50% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) coupled directly to the ionization source via a fused silica capillary interface (50 μm × 50 cm). Sample droplets were analyzed in both the positive and negative ionization modes. The ions entered the analyzer through an interface plate and subsequently through an orifice (100–120 μm diameter) at declustering potentials from 10 to 90 V in the positive ion mode, and at –50 V in the negative ion mode. Full scan spectra were acquired over m/z 500–2200 in 0.2 Da steps with a total scan time of 3 s. To help determine if EpI was sulfated, MS spectra of native and synthetic EpI, CCK-8 (a sulfated peptide standard) and MLP111 (a phosphorylated peptide standard) were acquired over m/z50–100. A high declustering voltage of –220 V and negative ion detection were used to confirm the presence of the sulfate and related ions. The declustering potential is the orifice voltage less the reference voltage (R0), which was 30 or –30 V in positive or negative ion modes, respectively. HPLC/MS analysis of crude venom (20 μl of a 2 mg/ml solution) was performed with a 5-μm Vydac C18 column (0.21 × 25 cm) eluted at 130 μl/min with 100% A for 2 min and then 0 to 80% B over 80 min: solvent A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 90% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectra were acquired over m/z 400–2200 at 0.2 Da steps, with a dwell time of 0.3 ms and a total scan time of 3.2 s. Native EpI (1 nm) was added to the reaction buffer (25 μl; 0.1 m NH4OAc/acetonitrile, 90/10 (v/v); pH 4) and reacted with the reducing agent Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (2:1, w/w). An aliquot (1 μl) was injected into the MS to determine the extent of reduction over 2 to 10 min. This partially reduced EpI was reacted with 100 mm of the alkylating reagent maleimide (pH 4.0; 21 °C) over 5 min with 1-μl aliquots injected into the MS to determine the extent of alkylation. A reaction product representing the alkylation of one disulfide bond, as determined by MS, was isolated using reversed-phase gradient HPLC on a 5-μm Vydac C18 column (0.21 × 25 cm). To determine disulfide bond connectivity of EpI, this partially reduced product was subjected to Edman sequencing. Disulfide bond connectivity was also determined by collision-induced dissociation MS. Collision-induced dissociation of the partially reduced and alkylated parent precursor ion was effected by bombardment with ultrapure Argon. Bombardment was carried out in quadrupole-2 with a collision cell gas thickness of 3 × 1014 atoms/cm2 and a collision energy (Q-0 to Q-2 rod offset voltage) of typically 20–40 eV relative to the laboratory frame. The resulting product ion spectra were obtained by scanning quadrupole-3 over m/z 50–2200 at 0.2 Da steps. Spectra were analyzed with MacBioSpec (PE-SCIEX). Two peptides, EpI and [Tyr15]EpI, were each synthesized on a 0.5-mmol scale by manual solid phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc chemistry. The following amino acid side chain protecting groups were used: Arg(Pmc), Asn(Trt), Asp(OtBu), Cys(Trt), and Ser(tBu). Met, Gly, and Pro, were used without side chain protection. Sulfated tyrosine was used for the synthesis of EpI and Tyr(tBu) was used for the synthesis of the unsulfated peptide ([Tyr15]EpI). Peptide resin samples (∼5 mg) were removed after each coupling step for determination of residual free α-amino groups by the quantitative ninhydrin test (20Sarin V.K. Kent S.B.H. Tam J.P. Merrifield R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 147Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), except for couplings to proline where a coupling efficiency of >99.5% was assumed where the result of a modification of the Isatin test (21Kaiser E. Bossinger C.D. Colescott R.L. Olsen D.B. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1980; 118: 149-151Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar,22Pritchard C.I. Auffret A.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1986; 14: 1286-1287Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) was satisfactory. Double couplings were used to achieve coupling efficiencies of >99.5%. First couplings <95% were obtained only for residues 8 and 9 of [Tyr15]EpI. TheNα-Fmoc group was removed on resin from the fully protected peptide by treatment with piperidine/dimethylformamide (1:1, 2 × 1 min) and the partially deprotected peptide resin was dried under a stream of nitrogen after washing with dimethylformamide and dichloromethane. The peptide was cleaved from the resin and the side chain protecting groups were simultaneously removed by treatment with (i) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (9:1, v/v) with 50 eq of m-cresol or (ii) trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane (9:1, v/v) (33Yagami T. Shiwa S. Futaki S. Kitagawa K. Chem. & Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1993; 41: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), both at 4 °C for 3 to 5 h with similar results. The majority of the trifluoroacetic acid was removed on a rotavapor and the crude peptide precipitated, washed with ether, dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, diluted with water, and lyophilized. The peptide precipitation, washing, and dissolution steps were carried out under a stream of nitrogen to minimize uncontrolled air oxidation of the peptide. The peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC and the purified reduced peptides (100 μm) were oxidized in 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.3, at room temperature for 24–48 h. Synthetic peptide oxidation was monitored by analytical reversed-phase HPLC on a 5-μm Vydac C18 column (0.46 × 25 cm). EpI and [Tyr15]EpI were obtained using a preparative 10-μm Vydac C18 column (2.2 × 25 cm) eluted at 8 ml/min with 5 to 50% B over 60 min and 50 to 80% B over 20 min: solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 90% acetonitrile, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluant was monitored at 230 nm. Retention times of native and synthetic peptides were compared by analytical reversed-phase HPLC (see above) eluted at 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0.7% acetonitrile/min from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 90% acetonitrile, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid. Coelution was confirmed by co-injection of synthetic and native EpI in a 2:1 ratio. Acetonitrile, ethanol, and glacial acetic acid were from BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, United Kingdom. High purity water was generated by a Milli-QTM purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Triethylamine (freshly distilled) was from Sigma. Phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) and amino acid standards were from Pierce. Sodium acetate was from Aldrich Chemical Co. 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, piperidine, trifluoroacetic acid, diisopropylethylamine, dimethylformamide (peptide synthesis grade), and Fmoc-sulfotyrosine were purchased from Auspep (Melbourne, Australia). Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was obtained from Waters Millipore (Milford, MA). Fmoc-aa-resin (Ramage Amide-Resin, tricyclic amide linker) was purchased from BAChem and Fmoc-l-amino acids were purchased from BAChem, Nova Biochem, and Auspep. Stock solutions (100 mm) of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (Strem Chemicals), maleimide (Aldrich), 4-vinylpyridine and dithiothreitol were prepared in 90:10 (v/v) 0.1 m NH4OAc/acetonitrile, pH 4.0, and stored at –20 °C. Other reagents and solvents were ACS analytical reagent grade. Chromaffin cells were isolated from bovine adrenal medullary tissue and cultured as described previously (23Livett B.G. Mitchelhill K.I. Dean D.M. Poisner A.M. Trifaro J-M. In Vitro Methods for Studying Secretion. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Biomedical Division, Amsterdam1987: 171-175Google Scholar). The protocol employed for the catecholamine release studies was that detailed by Livettet al. (24Livett B.G. Marley P.D. Mitchelhill K.I. Wan D.C.C. White T.D. Poisner A.M. Trifaro J-M. In Vitro Methods for Studying Secretion. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Biomedical Division, Amsterdam1987: 177-204Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted on 24-well culture plates containing 0.4 ml of medium/well at 1.25 × 106cells/ml. Following a 3-day incubation at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% carbon dioxide, the culture was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 5 min. To remove the incubation medium, the culture was washed with modified Locke's buffer of the following composition in mm: NaCl, 154; KCl, 2.6; CaCl2, 2.2; K2HPO4, 2.15; KH2PO4, 0.85; MgSO4, 1.18; d-glucose, 10; and bovine serum albumin, 0.5%. The cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of synthetic conotoxin (0–10 μm) for 5 min at room temperature and then incubated for 5 min with 4 μmnicotine ± conotoxin. Cells treated with buffer alone, 4 μm nicotine alone, or conotoxin alone served as controls. The incubation medium containing released catecholamines was removed and acidified with 2 m perchloric acid. To determine total cell catecholamines, the cells in each culture plate well were treated for 5 min with 0.01 m perchloric acid to lyse the cells and acidified to a final concentration of 0.4 m perchloric acid. The released catecholamines were quantified by electrochemical oxidation, after separation by reverse-phase HPLC (24Livett B.G. Marley P.D. Mitchelhill K.I. Wan D.C.C. White T.D. Poisner A.M. Trifaro J-M. In Vitro Methods for Studying Secretion. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Biomedical Division, Amsterdam1987: 177-204Google Scholar). For K+-induced catecholamine release experiments, 56 mm KCl was used as the agonist instead of nicotine. In the nicotine/conotoxin competition experiments, the cells were incubated with synthetic EpI or [Tyr15]EpI at 1 μmand varying concentrations of nicotine (0–100 μm). Male Buffalo rats (150–250 g, 3–4 months old) were sacrificed by asphyxiation with carbon dioxide and exsanguinated. The left hemi-diaphragm and phrenic nerve were isolated as described previously (25Bulbring E. Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1946; 1: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) and mounted under 1 g of resting tension in a 25-ml organ bath containing Krebs-Henseleit solution aerated with carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2). The nerve was stimulated via a bipolar electrode with pulses of 0.5-ms duration and supramaximal voltage using a Grass S48 stimulator with an SIU5 isolation unit. Single twitches were produced by continuous stimulation at 0.1 Hz, interspersed at 5-min intervals by train-of-four twitches (2 Hz for 1.9 s) or tetanic contractions (50 Hz for 2 s), measured alternately. Responses were detected using a Grass FT03 isometric force-displacement transducer connected to a Neotrace DC amplifier and recorded via a Mac Lab/4S using the application Chart (v 3.4/s) on a Macintosh LC630 computer. The tissue was treated with synthetic conotoxin (1–10 μm) in buffer for 60 min, washed several times with buffer alone, and then allowed a 30-min recovery time prior to treatment with the next higher toxin concentration. Data analyses were performed as described previously (26Blount K. Johnson A. Prior C. Marshall I.G. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Membrane currents were studied in isolated parasympathetic neurons of neonatal rat intracardiac ganglia. The procedures for isolation of these neurons have been described in detail previously (27Cuevas J. Adams D.J. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, neonatal rats (3–8 days old) were sacrificed by decapitation, and the heart was excised and placed in a saline solution containing (mm): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 0.6 MgCl2, 7.7 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH). Atria were removed and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in saline solution containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (Type 2; Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ). Following enzymatic treatment, clusters of ganglia were dissected from the epicardial ganglion plexus, transferred to a sterile culture dish containing high glucose culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and triturated using a fine-bore Pasteur pipette. The dissociated neurons were then plated onto 18-mm glass coverslips coated with laminin, and incubated at 37 °C for 24–72 h under 95% air, 5% CO2, in a humid atmosphere. At the time of the experiments, neurons were transferred to a recording chamber (0.5-ml volume) and viewed at 400 × magnification using an inverted phase-contrast microscope. Membrane currents were recorded from isolated intracardiac neurons under voltage clamp conditions using the whole-cell patch recording configuration (28Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar). In whole-cell experiments, electrical access was achieved either by rupturing the membrane patch and dialyzing the cell, or through the use of the perforated patch method (29Rae J. Cooper K. Gates P. Watsky M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The perforated patch method allows the intracellular integrity of the neurons to be maintained to confirm that any effects are independent of possible cell dialysis effects which can alter the functional response of these neurons (30Cuevas J. Adams D.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 111: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For perforated patch experiments, a stock solution of 60 mg/ml amphotericin B in dimethyl sulfoxide was prepared the day of the experiment and kept on ice, in the dark. Immediately prior to use, the amphotericin B stock solution was diluted in pipette solution (see below) to yield a final concentration of 360 μg/ml amphotericin B in 0.6% dimethyl sulfoxide. Following gigaseal formation, the neurons were held at –70 mV and voltage pul"

To date, only one gene for kinesin light chain has been characterized, while a second gene was identified in a genomic sequencing study but not analyzed biochemically. Here we describe new genes encoding kinesin light chains in mouse. One of these light chains is neuronally enriched, while another shows ubiquitous expression. The presence of multiple kinesin light chain genes in mice is especially interesting, since there are two kinesin heavy chain genes in humans (Niclas, J., Navone, F., Hom-Booher, N., and Vale, R. D. (1994) Neuron 12, 1059–1072). To assess the selectivity of kinesin light chain interaction with the heavy chains, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments. The data suggested that the light chains form homodimers with no specificity in their interaction with the two heavy chains. Immunofluorescence and biochemical subfractionation suggested differences in the subcellular localization of the two kinesin light chain gene products. Although both kinesin light chains are distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, there is enrichment of one in sciatic nerve axons, while the other shows elevated levels in olfactory bulb glomeruli. These results indicate that the mammalian nervous system contains multiple kinesin light chain gene products with potentially distinct functions.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). KHC contains three distinct domains: an N-terminal motor containing the ATP and microtubule binding sites (15Yang J.T.

The tail and parts of the α-helical coiled-coil are thought to be involved in binding KLC (17Gauger A.K. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). KHC alone is capable of ATP-dependent movement along microtubules in vitro (21Yang J.T. Saxton W.M. Stewart R.J. Raff E.C. Goldstein L.S.B. Science. 1990; 249: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The role of KLC in the native complex is poorly understood. Notably, KLC structure is highly conserved. Sequences that are most conserved include an N-terminal coiled-coil region of 107 amino acids and six modular imperfect repeats of 34 amino acids known as tetra-trico peptide repeats (TPR) encompassing a total of 252 amino acids (22Gindhart J.G.J. Goldstein L.S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 52-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The KLC coiled-coil domain is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with KHC (17Gauger A.K. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13657-13666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TPR domain has been implicated in protein-protein interaction in a large group of structurally and functionally diverse proteins (23Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Thus, it is probable that the KLC TPR domain is involved in either direct binding to other proteins, e.g. cargo, or in interactions with KHC. Strikingly, KLC mRNA is alternatively spliced in rat, squid, sea urchin, and worms (24Cyr J.L. Pfister K.K. Bloom G.S. Slaughter C.A. Brady S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), only one gene has been identified within any nonmammalian species. In this study, we use sequence analysis and genetic mapping to demonstrate that KLC is encoded by multiple genes in mice. The data show that the expression and behavior of two of the KLC gene products are different. Together, our data suggest that the two characterized kinesin light chains and the four separate holoenzymes produced by the known patterns of association have distinct functions. Mouse KLC genes were identified by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides in the TPR domain. The nucleotide sequences for the coding and noncoding primers were GGCCCGAGCTCGT(G/A/T)GC(C/A)AC(C/T/A)ATG(C/T)TT(C/A/G)AA(C/T)AT and CGCCGGTACCTT(G/T)CC(C/T)TG(G/A)TT(C/T)TGGCA(C/A/G)AG, respectively. Flanking SacI and KpnI restriction sites allowed for directional cloning of PCR products into pBluescript (SK+) plasmid (Stratagene). The source of DNA for PCR amplification was a Balb/c neonatal mouse brain cDNA library in λ Zap (Stratagene). PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min; 5 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 42 °C for 1 min, 1-min ramp to 72 °C, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min; final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min; and a final cooling to 4 °C. Two different 300-bp PCR amplification products were obtained that resembled the known rat KLC sequence (24Cyr J.L. Pfister K.K. Bloom G.S. Slaughter C.A. Brady S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10114-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These 300-bp fragments of KLC1 and KLC2 were used to probe the same cDNA library for full-length clones by standard methods (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The longest clone from each screening was sequenced on both strands (Sequenase kit; U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Complete sequence of KLC2 was obtained by 5′-RACE (5′-RACE system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends, version 2.0; Gibco Life Technologies, Inc.). Sequence analysis was performed with the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software package (30Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). KLC1 and KLC2 were mapped to mouse chromosomes using the Jackson Laboratory backcross panels (F1 ×Mus spretus). Genomic DNA from 94 offspring of F1 matings with M. spretus were obtained from Jackson Laboratory, digested withTaqI, run on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to GeneScreen+ (NEN Life Science Products) as described by the manufacturer, and probed with random primed KLC1 and KLC2, and the polymorphisms were noted. PstI/EagI fragments of KLC1 (453 bp) and KLC2 (501 bp) were subcloned into pBS (SK+) to generate non-cross-hybridizing probes. Prehybridization and hybridization were in 6× SSC (1× SSC: 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate dihydrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Final washes were in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Polymorphism patterns were sent to Jackson Laboratory for analysis; chromosomal localization was assigned relative to other genes previously mapped by Jackson Laboratory. Total RNA was made from mouse tissues using Trizol (Gibco Life Technologies, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm, and 15 μg was loaded per lane on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to GeneScreen+ membrane (NEN Life Science Products) as suggested by the manufacturer. SacI/EcoRI fragments of the PstI/EagI subclones of KLC1 and KLC2 were random primed and used as probes for Northern blots. Ethidium bromide staining of the 28 S and 18 S bands were used to visualize intact RNA. Approximate loading per lane was quantitated with an Eagle Eye apparatus (Stratagene) using integration density. Prehybridization and hybridization were in 5× SSPE (1× SSPE: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 1.25 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. Final wash was with 0.1× SSPE at room temperature. Bands observed were quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) using the volume integration function of the ImageQuant program. An NcoI/XhoI fragment of KLC1, which accounts for all but the first seven amino acids of the sequence, was subcloned into pGEX-KG (31Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) to produce a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion protein. AnXhoI/SacI (1784-bp) fragment of KLC2, which accounts for all of the coding sequence from the largest clone (591 amino acids) from the cDNA library, was also subcloned into pGEX-KG to make a GST fusion protein. Recombinant KLC1 and KLC2 protein were overexpressed by induction of transformed BL21 (DE3) bacteria at log phase with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Recombinant proteins were obtained by lysing the bacterial pellet with a French press (1000 p.s.i.) and purifying the supernatant from a 15,000 rpm centrifugation (SS34 rotor, Sorvall) on a glutathione-agarose (Sigma) column. Recombinant KLC1 and KLC2 were eluted from the glutathione-agarose column with excess glutathione (15 mm) and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel slices were injected into three rabbits for each antigen (Lampire, Pipersville, PA). Initial boosts were 0.5 mg of GST-conjugated KLC1 or KLC2 followed by subsequent monthly boosts of 0.25 mg. Serum was obtained monthly, affinity-purified, and preadsorbed against the other form of KLC to remove cross-reacting antibodies. These experiments were conducted using purified GST-KLC1 and GST-KLC2 linked to Affi-Gel 15 and Affi-Gel 10, respectively (Bio-Rad). Affinity purification was done by incubating serum with the beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The column was washed twice with 10× column volume of TBS (50 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Affinity-purified antibodies were eluted from the column with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, immediately neutralized with 0.1× volume of 2 m Tris, pH 8, and dialyzed in TBS overnight at 4 °C. Affinity-purified antibodies were preadsorbed by running the antibody solution over the other KLC column to remove cross-reacting antibodies. Affinity-purified antibodies were concentrated in Ultrafree-4 Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore Corp.) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Mouse tissues were homogenized in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mmdibasic sodium phosphate, 2 mm monobasic potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors, and the supernatant was collected after a 3000 × g centrifugation. The crude tissue homogenates were quantitated by a Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad), and 100 μg of total protein was solubilized in 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer and loaded per lane. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat milk (Carnation). Primary affinity purified/preadsorbed antibody (anti-KLC1 or anti-KLC2) was added at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Antibody 63-90 (33Stenoien D.L. Brady S.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), was used at a 1:1000 dilution of ascites fluid. Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove PA). Anti-KLC1 or -KLC2 antibody was detected by chemiluminescence using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described in their protocols. Mouse brain was homogenized in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), and the supernatant was collected (T1270 rotor, 35,000 rpm). Protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed) were preblocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in RIPA buffer for 1 h at 4 °C and washed with RIPA buffer prior to use. 100 μl of brain extract was precleared by incubating with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The solution was spun at 3000 rpm for 2 min in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was collected. The precleared brain lysate was then incubated with affinity-purified/preadsorbed anti-KLC1, -KLC2, -nKHC, or -uKHC (1Niclas J. Navone F. Hom-Booher N. Vale R.D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1059-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) antibodies at a final concentration of 5–20 μg/ml for 1 h at 4 °C prior to adding 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The solution was centrifuged as above, and the supernatant and pellet were saved. The pellet was washed 3 times in 500 μl of RIPA buffer and finally washed 1 time in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8. Equivalent amounts of the immunoprecipitate were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and subjected to Western blotting as described above. nKHC and uKHC antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:100 for Western analysis. Adult mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 30 ml of cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brain or sciatic nerve was dissected out and postfixed for 2 h prior to cryoprotection in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight. Cryosections (14 μm) were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in buffer (1× PBS, 0.6% Triton X-100, and 5% bovine serum albumin) for 14–18 h at 4 °C. Antibodies against KLC1 and KLC2 were used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. HC2S2 cells were grown on glass coverslips as described by Hoshimaru et al. (34Hoshimaru M. Ray J. Sah D.W. Gage F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1518-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The cells were washed once in PBS prior to a 10-min fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. The cells were then washed two more times with PBS before permeabilization with 0.2% Triton-X in PBS for 2 min at room temperature. Primary antibody was added as described above in buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween, and 3% bovine serum albumin). Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations or dilutions: anti-KLC1 and anti-KLC2 (100 μg/ml), 63-90 (1:250 dilution of ascites fluid), SMI31 (Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Baltimore, MD; 1:300 dilution of ascites fluid), and S100 (Sigma; 1:500 dilution of ascites fluid). Fluorescein-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (2 μg/ml) and Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (2.5 μg/ml) or fluorescein-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (2 μg/ml) and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (2 μg/ml) secondary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence microscopy. Samples were observed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal laser scanning microscope. Biochemical fractionation of brain was conducted as described (35Arai M. Cohen J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Differential centrifugation was used to obtain fractions S1, P1, S2, P2, S3, and P3 (P1, unlysed cells and crude nuclear pellet and corresponding supernatant S1; P2, crude mitochondrial pellet and synaptosomal fraction and corresponding supernatant S2; P3, crude microsomal pellet; S3, cytosolic fraction). P2 fraction was further subfractionated on a discontinuous Ficoll gradient into P2A (myelin fraction), P2B (synaptosomal fraction), and P2C (mitochondrial fraction). Pellets were resuspended in volumes equal to the supernatants, and equal volumes of all subfractions were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Western blotting was done as described above. Anti-synaptophysin (Boehringer Mannheim) and Suk4 (42Ingold A.L. Cohn S.A. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2657-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) antibodies were used at a 1:10 dilution of the manufacturer's stock solution and 1:10 dilution of hybridoma supernatant, respectively. Microtubules were stabilized and polymerized using taxol as described (36Barton N.R. Pereira A.J. Goldstein L.S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Hanlon D.W. Yang Z. Goldstein L.S.B. Neuron. 1997; 18: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent motors were induced to bind to microtubules in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP. These motors were then sedimented with microtubules and released with ATP. Conserved nucleotide sequences in the TPR domain were used to design two degenerate primers for PCR amplification from a mouse brain cDNA library. Two 300-bp products with similar but not identical sequences were obtained. These two products were used as probes to screen for longer clones from the same library. The longest cDNA clone of each of the mouse KLC products was completely sequenced on both strands. One of the clones, KLC1, yielded a full-length sequence of 2289 bp (GenBankTM accession numberAF055665) and encoded both the translation start site and the poly(A) tail. The other clone, KLC2, was 2682 bp in length and contained the poly(A) tail but not the translation start site. The 5′-end of KLC2 was obtained by 5′-RACE and directly sequenced to finish KLC2 full-length sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF055666). The two mouse kinesin light chain sequences were compared with each other using the Genetics Computer Group GAP program (30Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). Mouse KLC1 and KLC2 predicted polypeptide sequences were almost identical in the 34-amino acid modular TPR domains (Fig. 1 A) and also showed a high degree of similarity in the N-terminal coiled-coil region. The linker region between the coiled-coil and the TPR domain and the C-terminal ends diverged the most between the two mouse KLCs. KLC1 and KLC2 were predicted to form protein products of 61 and 67 kDa, respectively. Multiple sequence alignments of KLC1, KLC2, and kinesin light chains cloned from various organisms suggests that there are three classes of KLC genes (Fig. 1 B). Kinesin light chain sequences from sea urchin, squid, Drosophila, rat, and human KLC seem to be true homologues of mouse KLC1. A third kinesin light chain sequence (referred to as KLC3 throughout this paper) in humans and mice was recently identified by sequencing regions of genomic DNA flanking theERCC2 gene (Ref. 38Lamerdin J.E. Stilwagen S.A. Ramirez M.H. Stubbs L. Carrano A.V. Genomics. 1996; 34: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 2J. E. Lamerdin, personal communication. The predicted amino acid sequence of KLC3 suggest that it encodes a kinesin light chain of approximately 56 kDa and is missing the sixth TPR domain. However, it remains to be determined if KLC3 is actually expressed or is a psuedogene. Both mouse KLC2 and mouse KLC3 are possibly in a unique class to themselves and seem equally divergent from kinesin light chains isolated from worms. Although KLCs can be classified into three groups, certain domains of this modular protein are highly conserved. The polypeptide sequences of the known KLCs diverge the most at the C-terminal end and are most highly conserved in the TPR domains. The coiled-coil domain, through which KLC appears to interact with KHC (17Gauger A.K. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13657-13666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is also conserved although not to the same extent as the TPR domains. The Jackson Laboratory developed backcross panels that utilize polymorphisms between two different mouse species, M. musculus and M. spretus, to map genes to within a centimorgan. Non-cross-hybridizing KLC1 and KLC2 probes were used to findTaqI polymorphisms using Southern blots of genomic DNA fromM. musculus (C57/bl6) and M. spretus. These probes were then used for Southern analysis of 94 offspring from an F1 × M. spretus backcross. KLC1 mapped to the distal end of mouse chromosome 12 betweenYy1 and D12Bir10 in the Jackson Laboratory chromosomal map. It was predicted to be 4.6 centimorgans distal of Yy1 and 2.2 centimorgans proximal of D12Bir10. This 6.8-centimorgan region was superimposed on a representation of the same region from The Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome (56The Jackson Laboratory. The Encyclopedia of the Mouse Genome, Release 3.0, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME.Google Scholar) 3Available on the World Wide Web athttp://www.informatics.jax.org/encyclo.html. using the nearest common markers in both maps (Yy1 and D12Bir10). KLC1 was in the vicinity of Tnfαip2, Tsu, Tthy,Tpre, and Tind on the mouse chromosome. This region is also syntenic with human chromosome 14q32. KLC2 mapped to the proximal end of mouse chromosome 19 between D19Mit32 andLpc1 in the Jackson Laboratory chromosomal map. KLC2 was predicted to be 1.1 centimorgan distal to D19Mit32 and 13.1 centimorgan proximal to Lpc1. The representative region of localization of KLC2 in the mouse genome map covered 5 centimorgans. This region is syntenic with human chromosome 11q12–11q13 and overlaps with the following mouse genes: Mr66–3, Pth,Pygm, EmK, Xmmv42, cdc20,adbk1, ly10, Pcna-ps2, andCd5. A human KLC gene (28Cabeza-Arvelaiz Y. Shih L.C. Hardman N. Asselbergs F. Bilbe G. Schmitz A. White B. Siciliano M.J. Lachman L.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was recloned by another group by reverse transcriptase-PCR of adult human cerebral cortex RNA. This reverse transcriptase-PCR product mapped to human chromosome 14q32.3 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (39Goedert M. Marsh S. Carter N. Genomics. 1996; 32: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), suggesting that KLC1 is the mouse counterpart of this human KLC gene. Sequence analysis of the ERCC2 gene regions in human, hamster, and mouse led to the discovery of a kinesin light chain-like sequence in human chromosome 19q13.2-q13.3 (38Lamerdin J.E. Stilwagen S.A. Ramirez M.H. Stubbs L. Carrano A.V. Genomics. 1996; 34: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This ERCC2 flanking gene is possibly a third KLC gene, since it mapped to mouse chromosome 7. Northern analysis was conducted on tissues from adult mice. Although both KLC1 and KLC2 transcripts were enriched in neuronal tissue, KLC2 was the major kinesin light chain in nonneuronal tissues. Hence, KLC2 was considered to be “ubiquitously” expressed. KLC1 was the minor form of kinesin light chains in all tissues except brain, where its transcript level was equivalent to that of KLC2, and thus it is referred to as “neuronally enriched.” Since the Northern blots were done with different probes for KLC1 and KLC2, the intensities of bands in Fig. 2 A cannot be directly compared with those in Fig. 2 B. However, the relative intensities in different tissues in each blot can be directly compared after quantitation and normalizing for loading (shown in Fig. 2 D). Northern blots were also done with embryonic mouse brain from various stages of development (data not shown). Both KLC1 and KLC2 transcripts were expressed at embryonic day 14.5 (earliest time point in the experiment), although the expression level was lower than adult. Polyclonal antibodies raised against nearly full-length KLC1 and KLC2 were affinity-purified on the cognate antigen and then preadsorbed against the other mouse KLC protein to remove cross-reacting antibodies. Specificity was tested using Western blots of GST fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. (Fig. 2, Hand I). These non-cross-reacting antibodies were used to probe Western blots of the crude cytoplasmic fraction of various adult mouse tissues. The protein distribution of the two"

Because of its unique expression pattern in lymphocyte differentiation, it appears to function as an immunoregulatory molecule. We previously reported that CD38 was specifically induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Here we studied the molecular mechanism of the RA-dependent induction of human CD38. The expression of CD38 mRNA by RA appeared to be caused by the transcriptional stimulation of the gene, since it was blocked by an RNA synthesis inhibitor, but not by a protein synthesis inhibitor. In search of the RA response element (RARE) possibly present in human CD38 gene promoter, we isolated and sequenced the genomic DNA covering the 5′-flanking region, exon 1, and partial intron 1. Transient transfection experiments revealed that the responsiveness to RA was conferred through an RARE consisting of two direct repeat TGACCT-like hexamer motifs with a 5-nucleotide spacer, which was located in the first intron rather than the 5′-flanking region of the CD38 gene. This RARE interacted with heterodimer composed of RA receptor and retinoid X receptor in vitro. Thus, the RA-induced expression of the human CD38 gene was demonstrated to be mediated through the RARE located in the first intron.

The human cell surface antigen CD38 is a 46-kDa type II glycoprotein with a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a long carboxyl-terminal extracellular domain (1Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar). The expression pattern of CD38 has been widely investigated after the cell surface antigen was first identified as T10 by means of monoclonal antibodies directed against human T lymphocytes (2Reinherz E.L. Kung P.C. Goldstein G. Levey R.H. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1588-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Using these antibodies, CD38 was found to have a rather unique distribution pattern. It is strongly expressed on lymphocyte precursors, weakly expressed on peripheral B and T lymphocytes, up-regulated on activated lymphocytes and mature plasma cells, and also displayed on resting natural killer cells, monocytes, and granulocytes (2Reinherz E.L.

Because of this curious pattern of the distribution in lymphocyte differentiation, CD38 expression seems to be regulated by a complex mechanism. Besides the unique distribution pattern of CD38, interest in the cell surface molecule has grown recently after the finding that CD38 has an amino acid sequence similar to Aplysia ADP-rybosyl cyclase (9States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic ADP-ribose from NAD+ (10Lee H.C.

In addition to these enzyme activities, CD38 has the ability to bind hyaluronate, which is a large glycosaminoglycan existing in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface (16Nishina H.

Moreover, CD38 is considered to be an important regulatory molecule in the immune system, as inferred from the observation that CD38 ligation by its monoclonal antibodies induces various cell responses including cell proliferation, lymphopoieses, apoptosis, adhesion, cytokine production, and tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (17Funaro A.

CD38 is not expressed when HL-60 cells were treated with other inducers of granulocytic maturation, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (26Drach J. Zhao S. Malavasi F. Mehta K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the induction of CD38 appeared to be rather specific for RA-induced granulocytic differentiation (26Drach J. Zhao S. Malavasi F. Mehta K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and was mediated by RARα (27Drach J. McQueen T. Engel H. Andreeff M. Robertson K.A. Collins S.J. Malavasi F. Mehta K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1746-1752PubMed Google Scholar), 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, which also acts through nuclear receptors, was recently reported to increase CD38 expression in activated tonsillar B cells, peripheral T cells, and also in HL-60 cells (28Stoeckler J.D. Stoeckler H.A. Kouttab N. Maizel A.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4908-4917PubMed Google Scholar). Quite recently, it has been reported that transgenic mice expressing an antisense construct of RARα lacked or produced very low levels of CD38 in various tissues (29Mehta K. McQueen T. Manshouri T. Andreeff M. Collins S. Albitar M. Blood. 1997; 89: 3607-3614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that RA also plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of CD38 gene in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which RA induces CD38 gene expression and found that a functional RARE is indeed present in the first intron of the gene rather than the 5′-flanking region. HL-60 cells were cultured for the indicated times in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (25Kontani K. Nishina H. Ohoka Y. Takahashi K. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16895-16898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and total RNA was prepared from the cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA (30 μg) was separated by 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. TheBamHI-ClaI fragment of human CD38 cDNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 24 h in 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate), 50% formamide, 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 3× Denhardt's solution (1× Denhardt's solution = 0.002% Ficoll, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone), and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). The plasmid carrying cDNA sequence for elongation factor 1α (PAN7) was kind gift from Dr. Yoshito Kaziro, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, and was used for the hybridization probe as a control. pCDM:CD38 containing human CD38 cDNA was kindly supplied from Dr. David G. Jackson, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, United Kingdom (1Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar). A recombinant λ phage which contained 11 kbp of human CD38 genomic sequence covering 6 kbp of the upstream region (CG11) was isolated from a human genomic λ EMBL3 library using a PCR-amplified 180-bp fragment including 69 bp of noncoding and 111 bp of coding regions of human CD38 cDNA as a probe. The 11-kbp BamHI fragment from CG11, which contained the 5′-flanking region of CD38 promoter, exon 1, and intron 1, was subcloned into a pUC18 cloning vector (pCD11) for sequencing. pCDP1.7-CAT was constructed by inserting a NaeI-BglII fragment (CDP1.7; −1639 to +37) of pCD11 into a XbaI site upstream of the coding sequence for CAT in the reporter plasmid of pCAT-Basic (Promega). pCAT-Control harboring SV40 promoter and enhancer was purchased from Promega. pCDP1.7-CAT-I1.4 was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified fragment (I1.4; +73 to +1492 bp) of pCD11 into a BamHI site of pCDP1.7-CAT. The pG.CAT plasmids containing a series of various fragments of the intron 1 (I1.4) were constructed as follows. Various fragments of I1.4 as shown in Figs. 3 and 4 were amplified by a PCR reaction using primers having an additional sequence for BamHI digestion. The PCR-amplified fragments were digested with BamHI and inserted into a BamHI site upstream of the rabbit β-globin short promoter of pG.CAT (30Kato S. Tora L. Yamauchi J. Masushige S. Bellard M. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides were also used for the construction of another deletion (+741/+765) and mutation (MUT1–3) plasmids. All constructions were verified by sequencing. DR5-G.CAT plasmid was described previously (31Kato S. Sasaki H. Suzawa M. Masushige S. Tora L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Figure 4DNA sequence of the exon 1 and partial intron 1 of human CD38 gene. DNA sequence (from −35 to +1491) covering the exon 1 and partial intron 1 of human CD38 gene is illustrated. The transcription start site is located at +1 bp (arrow).

Reporter plasmids (20 μg of DNA) were transfected into the cells by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at a voltage of 200 V and a capacitance of 960 μF and supplemented with RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The transfected cells were further cultured with or without 1 μm RA at 37 °C for 36 h. Cell extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing and subjected for CAT assay after normalizing to the total amount of protein, which was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For the transfection into COS-7 cells, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, which had been treated with dextran-coated charcoal, in the absence of phenol red. Reporter pG.CAT plasmids (10 μg) harboring the various constructs of CD38 and the rabbit β-globin promoter, together with 0.5 μg of each expression vector for mouse RARα and RXRα (31Kato S. Sasaki H. Suzawa M. Masushige S. Tora L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), were transfected into the cells at 40–60% confluence in 9-cm Petri dishes by means of calcium phosphate coprecipitation. pSV-β-galactosidase (3 μg, Promega) was also co-transfected as an internal control to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency. pUC18 was used as a carrier to adjust the total amount of DNA to 20 μg. The transfected cells were maintained with the calcium phosphate-precipitated DNA at 37 °C for 1 h and cultured with or without 1 μm RA for 19 h. The cells were washed with fresh medium and further cultured for 20–24 h. Cell extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing and subjected for CAT assay after normalizing for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (30Kato S. Tora L. Yamauchi J. Masushige S. Bellard M. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Gel retardation assay was carried out as described before (30Kato S. Tora L. Yamauchi J. Masushige S. Bellard M. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Partially purified histidine-tagged mouse RARα and RXRα lacking the AB region (32Chen Z.P. Shemshedini L. Durand B. Noy N. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were incubated at 0 °C for 15 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmKCl, 0.1 mg/ml of double-stranded poly(dI-dC), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The binding reaction was initiated by adding synthesized oligonucleotides (10,000 cpm) that had been 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the mixture was incubated at 20 °C for 20 min. Samples were analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (30Kato S. Tora L. Yamauchi J. Masushige S. Bellard M. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 68: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). When HL-60 cells were cultured with RA and analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR analysis, CD38 mRNA was significantly detected within 3 h and reached to a maximum level at 18–24 h (25Kontani K. Nishina H. Ohoka Y. Takahashi K. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16895-16898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism whereby RA induced the expression of CD38 mRNA, effects of RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors, actinomycin D and cycloheximide, respectively, were examined. Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA prepared from HL-60 cells that had been cultured for 4 h in the presence or absence of RA and the inhibitors (Fig. 1). While actinomycin D strongly inhibited the induction of CD38 mRNA, cycloheximide did not have such an inhibitory effect, implying a transcriptional effect in the RA-induced expression of CD38 mRNA. A PCR-amplified 180-bp cDNA probe was used to screen a human genomic DNA library. Two positive clones were obtained after screening 1.2 × 106 phage plaques. By PCR analysis, we found that one clone (CG11) includes 6 kbp of 5′-flanking region, 0.3 kbp of exon 1, and partial intron 1 spanning 5 kbp (Fig. 2). A BamHI fragment from CG11 was subcloned into a pUC18 cloning vector for further analysis. A BglII fragment consisting of 1.7 kbp of the 5′-flanking region, exon 1, and 1.2 kbp of intron 1 was obtained from the clone and sequenced. In the 5′-flanking region of the CD38 gene, there were several putative cis-elements for transcription factors which may function in hematopoietic cells. Such included MZF-1, a hematopoietic cell-specific zinc finger protein (33Hromas R. Collins S.J. Hickstein D. Raskind W. Deaven L.L. O'Hara P. Hagen F.S. Kaushansky K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1786-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), LyF-1, a transcriptional regulator for lymphocyte-specific genes (35Lo K. Landau N.R. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5229-5243Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and C/EBPβ, a myeloid-specific transcription factor (36Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). However, no consensus sequence of the expected RARE was found throughout the 5′-flanking region sequenced. Recently, Nata et. al. (37Nata K. Takamura T. Karasawa T. Kumagai T. Hashioka W. Tohgo A. Yonekura H. Takasawa S. Nakamura S. Okamoto H. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 186: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reported the genomic structure of human CD38, together with the transcription start site and the partial nucleotide sequence. The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region reported by them was perfectly identical to that of our clone. To check the transcription start site again in HL-60 cells, primer extension analysis was performed using mRNA from RA-treated HL-60 cells (data not shown). In accordance with the previous report (36Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), multiple transcription start points were also suggested, but the major one was located about 75 bp upstream of the first ATG (see Fig. 4). Although there was no consensus RARE in the sequenced 5′-flanking region, Northern blot analysis in Fig. 1suggested the existence of an RARE-mediating transcriptional activation by RA in the CD38 gene. To explore the RARE, we analyzed CD38 promoter using a transient transfection assay with the CAT reporter gene. A series of CAT vectors containing various length of the 5′-flanking regions was transfected into HL-60 cells, and the cells were cultured with or without RA for 36 h. As shown in Fig. 2, pCDP1.7-CAT harboring 1.7 kbp of 5′-flanking region had strong transcriptional activity in HL-60 cells even in the absence of RA, but did not confer RA responsiveness. CAT vectors constructed with longer 5′-flanking regions (2.3 and 6 kbp) also failed to respond to RA (data not shown), suggesting that RARE exists out of the 5′-flanking region tested here. Therefore, we analyzed the first intron of the CD38 gene and found that pCDP1.7-CAT-I1.4 covering the 1.2 kbp of intron 1 confers RA responsiveness. To define the RARE possibly located in the 1.2-kbp partial intron 1, we used COS-7 cells because of the low efficiency in the transfection to HL-60 cells. The CD38 promoter was also replaced with the rabbit short β-globin promoter (−109/+10) to construct a pG.CAT plasmid because of the weakness of the CD38 promoter activity in COS-7 cells. The pG.CAT plasmids constructed with various regions of the intron 1 (from +73 to +1456) were co-transfected with expression vectors for mouse RARα and mouse RXRα into COS-7 cells, and the cells were incubated with or without RA for 40–44 h. As shown in Fig. 3, the transcriptional activity of pG.CAT (+73/+1456) was increased only 3.6-fold by RA. pG.CAT (+551/+1456) was still induced 2.5-fold by RA. However, the inducibility in pG.CATs (+73/+1097), (+73/+778), and (+691/+1456) were greatly increased to 14-, 86-, and 18-fold, respectively, by RA, although neither pG.CAT (+73/+696) nor (+787/+1456) was induced. These findings indicated that an RARE is located in the region from +691 to +778 and also suggested that there are repressor elements in the regions from +778 to +1097, +1097 to +1456, and +551 to +691, which may function in COS-7 cells. Indeed, the transcriptional activity of pG.CAT (+691/+778) was markedly (220-fold) stimulated by RA (see Fig. 5 A). Directly repeated PuGGTCA hexamer motifs separated by 5 spaces (DR5; PuGGTCA(N)5PuGGTCA) have been to constitute a consensus RARE which is recognized by RAR/RXR heterodimer and mediates RA-induced gene expression (38Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). DNA sequence (−35/+1491) covering the exon 1 and partial intron 1 of human CD38 gene is illustrated in Fig. 4. There are DR5-like motifs in the region from +745 to +761; TGACCCgaaagTGCCCC. This sequence is complementary orientation for GGGGCActttcGGGTCA which has one nucleotide mismatch compared with the consensus DR5 sequence, and this mismatch is similar to that of RARE (AGGTCActgacAGGGCA) localized in the promoter regions of complement factor H gene (38Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In addition, a putative Sp-1 motif (+731/+738) is present in the upstream of the DR5 motif. Further analysis with pG.CAT plasmids containing the putative Sp-1plus DR5-like motif (+725/+778) and DR5-like motif alone (+741/+765) suggested that this DR5-like motif, henceforth referred to as CD38-DR5, confers the RA responsiveness by itself (Fig. 5 A). The mutations of 2 bases in each half-site motif within box A and B (pG.CAT (MUT1) and (MUT2)) or both of them (pG.CAT (MUT3)) clearly impaired the ligand inducibility (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the present degenerated DR5 element, which is located in the intron 1 of CD38 gene, appeared to function as the response element for RA. We performed an in vitro binding assay with partially purified receptors to determine whether the nuclear receptors indeed bind the sequence of CD38-DR5 (Fig. 6). Gel-shift analysis using radiolabeled synthetic oligonucleotide of the CD38-DR5 sequence (+741/+765) revealed a retarded band only in the presence of both of RAR and RXR (Fig. 6 A, right panel). Moreover, the retarded band was further shifted up by the addition of a specific antibody raised against RAR or RXR. These properties were exactly the same as those observed with a consensus DR5, which was used as a control (left panel). The retarded band of the radiolabeled consensus DR5 or CD38-DR5 was competed by an excess molar amount of the consensus DR5 and also by CD38-DR5 to a lesser extent (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that the RAR/RXR heterodimer has higher affinity for the consensus DR5 than for CD38-DR5. Mutations in each motif within box A and B or both of them abolished binding of the RAR/RXR heterodimer (Fig. 6 C). These results, together with the transcriptional analysis, demonstrated that the DR5 present in the CD38 intron 1 indeed functions as an RARE. In this report, we found that a DR5-like element is present in the intron 1 (+741/+765) of the human CD38 gene. Using deletion and site-directed mutagenesis, this element was demonstrated to act as a functional RARE in both CAT-reporter gene assay and gel-retardation assay. In addition, the 5′-flanking region (−1639/+37) of the CD38 gene had transcriptional activity in HL-60 cells, which was much higher than that of SV40 promoter and enhancer (Fig. 2). There were also repressor elements in intron 1 both upstream and downstream of the RARE upon analysis in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3), although they have not been fully elucidated in the present study. Thus, various cis-elements located in intron 1 appeared to play important roles in the transcriptional regulation of the human CD38 gene. We thank Prof. Pierre Chambon and Dr. Hinrich Gronemeyer (INSERM, Strasbourg, France) for the generous gift of RAR/RXR materials and also for critical reading of the manuscript."

These mutations correspond to the replacement of the Gly-430 residue situated just before the second transmembrane domain of MDEG1, by bulky amino acids such as Val, Phe, or Thr. These results suggested that the Gly-430 residue of the channel MDEG1 was part of an inhibitory domain of a channel normally activated by an unknown ligand. More recently, MDEG1 was found to be activated by rapid external acidifications and to belong to the newly identified family of neuronal H+-gated channels (16Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F.

MDEG1 can associate with ASIC to form a heteromultimer with new properties (19Bassilana F. Champigny G. Waldmann R. de Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28819-28822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The present study extends the characterization of the properties of the H+-gated channel MDEG1 and uses the Xenopusoocyte expression system to show that the same mutations, which inC. elegans degenerins cause neurodegeneration, drastically alter both the pH sensitivity and inactivation process of the mammalian H+-gated channel MDEG1. This work clearly identifies a specific region situated just before the second transmembrane domain as playing a crucial role in both pH sensing and control of channel kinetics. The wild-type and mutant MDEG1 cDNAs were inserted into the pBSK-SP6-globin vector as described previously (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For expression in Xenopus oocytes, cRNA was synthesized from theNotI-digested vector using a kit from Stratagene.Xenopus oocytes were injected with 0.05–5 ng of cRNA, and microelectrode voltage-clamp and patch-clamp recordings were performed 1–3 days after injection. For MDEG1 mutants, which induced a large constitutive current (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), oocytes were kept in low Na+medium containing 10 mm NaCl and 86 mm NMDGCl. For outside-out patches the pipettes contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (with KOH). The bath medium contained 140 mm NaCl, LiCl, orN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 2 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (adjusted with HCl, NaOH, LiOH, or tetramethylammonium chloride). Data were sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 500 Hz for analysis (Biopatch software). The fast change of bathing solutions was accomplished by a rapid solution changer (RSC200, Biologic). Time of rotation from one tube to the adjacent was fixed at 5 ms. Intracellular acidification of oocytes was obtained by injection of 50 nl of the internal solution at pH 2 or by perfusion and removal of a bath medium containing 20 mmNH4Cl. We previously reported that MDEG1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes could not be activated by pH changes from the physiological external pH of 7.4 to pH 6, i.e. by conditions which fully activate ASIC (17Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). However, a more extensive investigation revealed that MDEG1, when expressed in oocytes, can in fact generate a rapidly activating and inactivating inward current in response to pH pulses to below pH 5.5 (Fig. 1 A). Very significant channel activations occur for pH jumps from pH 7.4 to pH values below 5. The half-maximal value of this activation by pH is pHm = 4.35 (Fig. 1 A). The H+ directly activate MDEG1 since H+-gated channels can be recorded in cell free membrane outside-out patches (Fig. 1 A). While extracellular acidification clearly activates the MDEG1 channel, intracellular acidification of oocytes failed to activate MDEG1 at an external pH of 7.4, nor did it alter the MDEG1 current induced by extracellular H+ after a pH jump from 7.4 to 4 (not shown). As it was previously observed in central neurons (20Ueno S. Nakaye T. Akaike N. J. Physiol. 1992; 447: 309-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) the inactivation process of the H+-gated channel can be described by a single exponential function. The rate of inactivation increases as the external pH is made more acidic (τpH 5 = 1.65 ± 0.2 s, τpH 3.5 = 0.129 ± 0.017 s (n = 15)) but does not show any significant voltage dependence (not shown). The H+-gated current generated by the MDEG1 channel is blocked by amiloride with a IC50 value of 28 μm (Fig. 1 B), is more permeable to Na+ and Li+ as compared with K+(P Na+/P K+ = 10), and is not significantly permeable to Ca2+ (Fig. 1 C). Na+ can thus be considered as the major permeant ion under physiological conditions. The single channel conductance is 10.4 pS (Fig. 1 D). MDEG1 is expressed in neurons in many different regions of the brain (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Garcia-Anoveros J. Derfler B. Neville-Golden J. Hyman B.T. Corey D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) such as hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex. Several types of H+-activated channels have been recorded in sensory and in hypothalamic neurons, but none has the properties which are described here for MDEG1 (21Akaike N. Ueno S. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 43: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is intringuing that the pH dependence of this channel occurs in such a low pH range. External pH variations have been observed in the brain which have led to the suggestion that the H+ could have a neurotransmitter role (22Chesler M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1990; 34: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 23Chesler M. Kaila K. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 95: 396-402Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The existence in the brain of H+-gated channels like ASIC, which are activated at pH values below 7, would tend to support this view (17Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). However, one does not really know whether neuronal activity would produce large pH variations to below pH 5.5 at the synaptic level. MDEG1 channels can probably be activated in pathophysiological conditions such as ischemia and epileptic seizures, which produce large acidifications of the extracellular medium (24Kraig R.P. Ferreira-Filho C.R. Nicholson C. J. Neurophysiol. 1983; 49: 831-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Of course another possibility is that MDEG1 can associate with other subunits that change its pH dependence toward a more alkaline pH range. Indeed, MDEG1 can associate with ASIC, but the pH dependence of the MDEG1/ASIC channel remains fairly acidic (pHm = 4.8) (19Bassilana F. Champigny G. Waldmann R. de Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28819-28822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The pH sensitivity of MDEG1 could also be modified by phosphorylation, by interactions with G proteins, or by a co-ligand, like the NMDA-gated ionic channel, which requires glycine to increase its glutamate sensitivity (25Johnson J.W. Asher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the pH sensitivity of MDEG1 might be a general feature of this new channel family and that MDEG1 is normally activated by a ligand other than H+. Neurodegeneration in C. elegans is caused by mutation of an Ala residue in DEG-1 and MEC-4 degenerins, just before the second transmembrane domain (1Chalfie M. Wolinski E. Nature. 1990; 345: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue in MDEG1 is Gly-430. We previously demonstrated that mutations of Gly-430 caused a constitutive activation of MDEG1 (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Properties of the H+-activated channel generated by MDEG1 at acidic pH are clearly distinct from those of the constitutively active mutated channels at pH 7.4 (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Gain-of-function mutant channels are more sensitive to amiloride (IC50 ∼2–13 μm), less selective for cations (P Na+/P K+ = 3–5), less conductive (gNa+ = 2–4 pS), and more voltage-dependent than the H+-gated channel (P 0 = 0.5 at −40 mV and 0.1 at −120 mV). Figs. 2 and3 show that substitution of Gly-430 by amino acids that cause neurodegeneration in C. elegansdegenerin MEC-4 (2Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and constitutively activate MDEG1 at pH 7.4 also markedly alter the properties of the H+-gated current. The pH dependence of their channel activity was shifted to much less acidic pH values than for wild-type MDEG1. A shift of at least two pH units toward alkaline pH was observed for MDEG1-G430V (pHm = 6.5) for MDEG1-G430T (pH = 6.7) and for MDEG1-G430F (pHm = 6.9) (Fig. 3). Another striking observation is that the inactivation process (that occurs after H+ activation of the MDEG1 channel) is completely abolished in G430T and G430F mutants and markedly slowed by the G430C mutation (Fig. 2, for the G430V mutant, see Figs. 4 and5).Figure 3pH dependence of the H+-gated channel activity of the Gly-430 mutants compared with the pH dependence of wild-type (WT) MDEG1.

Wolinski E. Nature. 1990; 345: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A) and the corresponding mutation in MEC-4 does not cause neurodegeneration (2Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, this mutation causes a small shift in the external pH dependence of MDEG1 from a pHm of 4.35 (MDEG1) to a pHmof 4.8 (MDEG1-G430S) (Fig. 3). It also produces a slower inactivation (τpH 5.4 = 4.16 ± 0.85 s, τpH 4 = 4.9 ± 0.6 s (n = 4)). The substitution of Gly-430 by Cys in the C. elegansdegenerin MEC-4 neither induced neurodegeneration nor acted as wild type because animals with this mutation are touch-insensitive as larvae and touch-sensitive as adults (2Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In MDEG1 this mutation also produced an intermediate phenotype. A constitutive current could be observed only when high amounts of cRNA were injected into Xenopusoocytes (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, the Gly-430 to Cys mutant required a less acidic pH for activation (pHm = 5.7) and its inactivation was much slower than that of the wild-type MDEG1 channel (τpH 5.8 = 31.8 ± 7.8 s (n = 9), τpH 5 = 29.1 ± 8.2 s (n = 6), Fig. 2 B). Since substitutions of Gly-430 by Val, Phe, or Thr, which constitutively activate the channel, also induce a marked shift in the external pH dependence of the MDEG1 channel, it remained a possibility that the basal current observed with all of these mutants was due to a partial activation of the H+-gated channel at pH 7.4. However, this is clearly not the case. Changing the initial pH from pH 7.4 to 8.5 did not change the intensity of the constitutive current of the MDEG1-G430V mutant (at pH 7.4 and 8.5I −70 mV = −1.36 μA ± 0.06 (n = 8)). The single channel properties of different mutants of MDEG1 at acidic pH values are described in Fig. 4. During a pulse to pH 5 the mutant H+-activated channels MDEG1-G430T and MDEG1-G430V remained permanently open until the pH returned to 7.4. Changes in the unitary current levels during the acidic step at pH 5 could be seen immediately after the removal of amiloride or when low concentrations of amiloride (1 μm), which are insufficient for complete blockade, were added (Fig. 4, A and B). Gly-430 mutations did not alter ionic selectivity and conductance of the H+-gated channels (Figs. 1, C and D, and 4, D and E). The Na+ versus K+ selectivities are nearly identical (wild type, P Na+/P K+ = 10; G430T, P Na+/P K+ = 10; G430V, P Na+/P K+ = 7; Figs. 1 D and 4 E) as well as the single channel conductances (wild type, gNa+ = 10.4 pS; G430T, gNa+ = 8.2 pS; G430V, gNa+ = 11 pS; Figs. 1 D and 4 E). However, Gly-430 mutations significantly increase the amiloride sensitivity (Figs. 1 Band 4 C, IC50 (WT) = 28 μm, IC50 (G430T) = 4 μm, IC50 (G430V) = 2 μm). Fig. 5 clearly shows that the channel activity of the MDEG1-G430V mutant produced by an acidic step is different from the constitutive channel activity recorded at pH 7.4, which has been previously described (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Currents recorded at pH 7.4 are due to the activity of three channels of 3 pS with a relatively low selectivity for Na+ (Figs. 4 E and 5), while currents recorded at pH 5 are due to the activity of three highly Na+-selective H+-gated channels of 11 pS (Figs. 4 E and 5). Therefore, MDEG1 Gly-430 mutants may express two different types of channel activity: (i) a constitutive channel activity, which is recorded at pH 7.4 (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and (ii) an altered H+-gated Na+ channel activity. Clearly these two types of activities are strongly correlated: (i) mutations such as G430T, G430V, and G430F, which induce large constitutive currents, also produce large changes in the pH dependence of the H+-gated current and suppress inactivation; (ii) mutation G430C that causes a low level of constitutive channel activity is accompanied by an intermediate change in the kinetics and the pH dependence of the H+-gated Na+ channel; and (iii) a mutation such as G430S that leads to only a small change of the kinetics and of the pH dependence of the H+-gated channel produces essentially no constitutive activity. Because both types of channel activity are strongly correlated and because the number of active channels observed on the same patch before and during acidification is identical (see Fig. 5), it seems unlikely that these two different types of channel activity are due to different forms of mutated channels. In that case, different numbers of active channels would be observed before and during acidification, and surperimposition of two types of activity would be observed. In fact, the same mutated channel may exist in the two conductance states, and the external pH may be responsible for the observed mode changes in channel activity. The present work provides interesting information about structural elements that are essential for the gating system of H+-gated channels. It clearly indicates that the part of the channel that includes Gly-430 has a key role in controlling the pH dependence, the inactivation kinetics, and also the amiloride sensitivity of this channel, but has no role in the control of the ionic selectivity and conductance. Gly-430 is situated in a hydrophobic environment situated just before the second transmembrane domain (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This part of the protein has also been suggested to have a key role in the gating system of the epithelial amiloride-sensitive Na+channel (26Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The logical link between glycine substitution by bulkier amino acids in MDEG1 and the shift of the pH sensitivity of the H+-gated Na+ channel is that these amino acid replacements probably produce a conformational change leading to a large modification of the apparent pK of the ionizable group(s) that control(s) this pH dependence. It is particularly striking that all mutations in MEC-4 or DEG-1 that provoke neurodegeneration in C. elegans also induce large changes in pH dependence and inactivation in the MDEG1 channel, that a mutation that provokes an intermediate phenotype in C. elegans also induces an intermediate phenotype (G430C) for the H+-gated Na+ channel, and also that a mutation that provokes no degeneration in C. elegans has hardly any effect (G430S) on the MDEG1 H+-gated channel function. This may suggest a similar function for both types of proteins. Because abnormal channel activation is known to be the main cause of several inherited neurodegenerative diseases in mice (27Zuo J. De Jager P.L. Takahashi K.A. Jiang W. Linden D.J. Heintz N. Nature. 1997; 388: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 28Navarro B. Kennedy M.E. Velimirovic B. Bhat D. Peterson A.S. Clapham D.E. Science. 1996; 272: 1950-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and because the codon of the Gly-430 residue in the human DNA sequence of MDEG1 is situated at a intron-exon junction (GenBankTMaccession no. 003687), it might turn out in the future that mutations in human MDEG1 may be implicated in some rare human neurodegenerative disease.

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). Together with soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs) NSF binds to a group of membrane receptors known as SNAREs (SNAP receptors) which are involved in membrane docking and/or fusion (2Söllner T.

SNAREs are anchored in either donor (“vesicle,” v-SNARE) or acceptor (“target,” t-SNARE) membranes, and bind to each other to form stable oligomeric complexes (3Söllner T. Bennett M.K.

Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). NSF and SNAP cooperate to disassemble these SNARE complexes in a reaction that requires ATP hydrolysis; the disassembly is a result of conformational changes that NSF induces in SNAPs and SNAREs (3Söllner T.

Disassembly of SNARE complexes enables individual SNAREs to participate in a dynamic series of protein-protein interactions that are essential for membrane trafficking. The timing of SNARE complex disassembly, and hence of NSF's action relative to the docking and fusion of two membranes has not been definitively established. In different systems, NSF appears to act before membrane docking (6Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 7Nichols B.J.

Nevertheless, it is apparent that inactivation of NSF, either by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide or by mutation of residues critical for ATP binding and hydrolysis, leads to accumulation of SNARE complexes and a block in membrane transport reactions (10Block M.R.

Each NSF subunit contains three primary domains: an amino-terminal N-domain required for substrate binding, and two ATPase domains referred to as D1 and D2 required for membrane transport activity and oligomerization, respectively (12Whiteheart S.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of one or more subunits within a single NSF oligomer results in a nonfunctional enzyme, indicating that the NSF oligomer exerts its function through a cooperative mechanism (12Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Recent analyses of NSF's structure by electron microscopy demonstrate that NSF is a hexagonal cylinder (16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) similar in size to related ATPases thought to be hexamers in solution (17Peters J.-M. Harris J.R. Lustig A.

In view of these findings, we have reevaluated NSF's oligomeric structure using a variety of quantitative analytical methods. The results unequivocally show NSF to be a hexamer, held together by oligomerization of its D2 domains. This clearly places NSF among a group of hexameric ATPases with a common mode of action. In many cases they trigger conformational switches in their protein substrates, which in turn engage in subsequent reactions. NSF bearing an amino-terminal histidine tag and a carboxyl-terminal Myc tag (His6-NSF-Myc) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to published procedures (12Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In brief, a bacterial lysate containing His6-NSF-Myc was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) and bound proteins were eluted with imidazole. For sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments, samples were eluted with steps of imidazole and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in the indicated final buffers. Peak fractions were stored on ice and used within a few days. For electron microscopy, NSF was eluted with a linear 50–500 mm imidazole gradient. The single symmetric peak was divided into two pools, one containing 90–95% of the NSF (∼200–350 mm imidazole, “major peak”) and the second containing the trailing 5–10% of the NSF (∼350–450 mm imidazole, “trailing edge”). These pools were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 15% (w/v) glycerol (buffer A) or 25 mm HEPES at pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT (buffer B). In some instances His6-NSF-Myc was purified further on a Superose 6 column run in buffer B. His6-NSF-Myc was either frozen in liquid N2 (preparation 1 in Fig. 5 A) or kept on ice (preparation 2 in Fig. 5 A) and shipped between laboratories for EM analyses. NSF domain mutant D2 with a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag was similarly prepared, as described previously (16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Equilibrium sedimentation experiments on His6-NSF-Myc were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge using the interference optics system to visualize the protein. Two sector cells equipped with sapphire windows were used. Blank scans on the buffer were collected at all speeds prior to sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Both blank and sample volumes were 150 μl. Data were collected at 4 °C at speeds of 4700, 5700, 7000, and 8800 rpm on samples at three initial concentrations ranging from 5 to 14 μm in buffer containing 20 mmHEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 5 mm DTT, 1% (v/v) glycerol supplemented with either 1 or 5 mm ATP. Initial protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Scans were collected at 60 min intervals, and sedimentation equilibrium was established using the MATCH algorithm. Equilibrium sedimentation data of NSF samples were initially analyzed for average molecular weights in terms of a single, homogeneous species according to cr=cmexp[ς(ξ−ξm)]+baseEquation 1 where c r is the concentration of NSF at a given radial position, c m is the concentration of the enzyme at a reference position (e.g. the meniscus), ς is the reduced molecular weight defined as, ς = M(1 − ν¯ρ)ω2/RT, M is the molecular weight, ν¯ is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, ω is the angular velocity, ξ =r2/2, r is the radial distance (cm) from the center of rotation, r m is the radial distance (cm) from the center of rotation to the meniscus, Ris the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature (Kelvin), and base is a correction term for a non-zero base line. The SEDNTERP program was used to calculate the partial specific volume (0.7348) and the buffer density (1.01142 at 4 °C). The final distribution of species was determined by global fitting of sedimentation equilibrium data according to cr=cm,3exp[3ς1(ξ−ξm)]+cm,6exp[6ς1(ξ−ξm)]Equation 2 +cm,12exp[12ς1(ξ−ξm)]+basewhere ς1 is the reduced molecular weight defined above) calculated for the NSF monomer andc m,3,c m,6, andc m,12 are the concentrations of the trimeric, hexameric, and dodecameric species at the meniscus. All fits were done by nonlinear least-squares analysis of the primary data using the Windows 95 version of the NONLIN algorithm (21Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The fit was optimized by minimization of the variance, and its quality was determined by examination of the residuals. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments on the D2 fragment of NSF were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge using the absorbance optics system to visualize the protein. Six sector cells equipped with quartz windows were used. The sample volumes were 110 μl. Data were collected at 4 °C at speeds of 10,800, and 13,300 rpm on samples at three initial concentrations ranging from 8 to 20 μm in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% (v/v) glycerol supplemented with 0.2 mm ATP. The best fit distribution of species was described according to cr=cm,6exp[ς6(ξ−ξm)]+cm,12exp[2ς6(ξ−ξm)]+baseEquation 3 where ς6 is the reduced molecular weight calculated for the D2 hexamer and the other terms are as described above. Sedimentation velocity data were collected at 4 °C at 24000 or 50000 rpm in 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, or 5 mm DTT, 1% (v/v) glycerol using interference optics to visualize the protein. Individual runs were supplemented with 5 mm ADP, 0.5 mm ATP, or 5 mm ATPγS. The sample and buffer volumes were 450 μl. Initial concentrations ranged from 12–230 μg/ml. Scans were collected at the maximum allowed rate of data collection. Data were analyzed according to the time derivative method of Stafford (22Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 23Stafford III, W.F. Schuster T. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston1994: 119-137Crossref Google Scholar, 24Stafford III, W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) using the DCDT software program to yield a sedimentation coefficient distribution, g(s*), from which a weight average sedimentation coefficient at a particular concentration and temperature can be calculated by integration over the distribution function with respect to s* as described previously by Stafford (22Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The weight average sedimentation coefficient at zero concentration, s0, was determined by linear extrapolation of the experimental weight average values to infinite dilution. The s20,w0 was calculated from thes0 value using SEDNTERP. The time-derivative method of sedimentation velocity analysis can also be used to determine an apparent sedimentation,s app, and an apparent diffusion,D app, coefficient at a particular concentration and temperature by the following relationships (25Stafford III, W.F. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: M-Pos452Google Scholar) Dapp=(ςg(sa)rmω2t)2/2tEquation 4 where r m is the radial position of the meniscus (cm), t is the equivalent sedimentation time (seconds), and ςs(s*g) is the standard deviation of the g(s*) versus s* curve determined by fitting to Equation 5 g(s*)=Aexp[−0.5((s*−sapp)/ςg(sa))2]Equation 5 where A and ςs(s*g) are constants, ands app is the apparent sedimentation coefficient given by the maximum position of the g(s*)versus s* curve. Values obtained in this manner fors app and D app were used to calculate NSF's mass with the Svedberg equation M=sRTD(1−νp)Equation 6 where the terms all have their normal meanings. The NSF frictional coefficient, f20,w0, was calculated from the s20,w0 using an alternate form Svedberg equation (Equation 6) where D =RT/Nf. SEDNTERP was used to estimate a value for NSF hydration (δ = 0.4071) from the amino acid composition. Simple interpretation of the frictional coefficient to estimate the NSF axial ratio using an oblate ellipsoid of revolution as a model was also accomplished using SEDNTERP. More complex interpretation of the NSF hydrodynamic shape was accomplished by bead modeling approaches where bead models of the “ATP” and “ADP” forms were created for subsequent analysis using the algorithm HYDRO (26Garcia de la Torre J. Navarro S. Lopez Martinez M.C. Diaz F.G. Lopez Cascales J.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 530-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The beads were arranged so that the mass was distributed according to the size and shape observed for the ADP and ATP forms of NSF by electron microscopy (see Fig. 4 B in Hanson et al. (16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar)). The mass distribution in the ADP hexagonal ring could be modeled with only 12 beads, whereas the ATP form required 18 beads in order to incorporate the six globular “feet” surrounding the central hexagonal ring. The bead radii used for the ATP and ADP bead models were 20.25 and 23.25 Å, respectively, so that both bead models would have the calculated masses corresponding to an NSF hexamer. For scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), 2–20 μm His6-NSF-Myc was either stabilized with 0.05% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 30 min on ice and then diluted to 100–500 nm in buffer A lacking glycerol or directly diluted without the glutaraldehyde step. 3–5-μl aliquots were adsorbed to thin carbon films (supported by thicker perforated carbon layers on gold-coated copper EM grids) which had been rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge in a plasma cleaner. They were subsequently washed on 6 drops of quartz bidistilled water and freeze dried in the STEM HB-5 microscope. Images were recorded at a nominal magnification of 200,000 using doses of 200–400 electrons/nm2 and an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Individual particles were manually selected from electron micrographs for mass analysis and processed as described (28Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The beam induced mass loss was determined experimentally by repeatedly scanning the same grid region and monitoring the change in sample mass. The main mass analysis data sets were corrected accordingly (28Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and image processing, 100–250 nm His6-NSF-Myc (diluted in buffer A lacking glycerol) was absorbed to carbon coated grids which had been rendered hydrophilic as above. The grids were washed once with water and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate (pH 4.5). Electron micrographs were recorded with a Phillips EM420 at a nominal magnification of 36,000 and an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The TEM images were digitized in an Eikonix model 1412 camera with a pixel size of 0.43 nm × 0.43 nm at the specimen level. NSF particles were selected from several EM images and subjected to single particle analysis and principle component analysis contained in the SEMPER and EM system program packages (29Hegerl R. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 30Saxton W.O. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The particles were laterally aligned by correlation methods using arbitrary reference molecules and subjected to principal component analysis afterward (31Frank J. van Heel F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 161: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The first two eigenvectors indicated a significant staining inhomogeneity which resulted in a density gradient across the molecule. Thus, the gradient was substracted prior to a further principal component analysis and classification with respect to eigenvectors representing the symmetry properties of the molecules. A class of 415 particles (out of 1746) was averaged and 6-fold symmetrized. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering was performed at 25 °C using a 30 cm × 7.8-mm TSK-Gel G3000SWxl gel filtration column (TosoHaas) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES at pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1% glycerol, and 1 mm ATP. The gel filtration column was followed in-line by a Mini-DAWN light scattering detector (Wyatt Technologies) and an interferometric refractometer (Wyatt Technologies) for protein concentration determination. Molecular weight calculations were carried out using ASTRA software (Wyatt Technologies). The change in refractive index as a function of protein concentration is approximately constant for proteins and a value of 0.193 mol−1 was used (27Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). These experiments were carried out using NSF expressed from a pET15b expression vector (Novagen) from which the NH2-terminal His6 tag was removed by thrombin treatment followed by repurification using size exclusion chromatography. Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation is a thermodynamically rigorous method for characterizing macromolecular mass and oligomeric interactions in solution (32Hensley P. Structure. 1996; 4: 367-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Analysis of NSF by this method was used to evaluate NSF's oligomeric state in solution. Typical data are shown in Fig. 1. These data, as well as additional data collected at different initial loading concentrations and speeds, were poorly described by a model for a single homogeneous species (Equation1), and yielded average molecular weights of 483,000–492,000, considerably higher than the 255,000 expected for the previously reported trimeric NSF oligomer (12Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The data were then analyzed using models of increasing complexity containing multiple oligomeric species (e.g. 1–6, 3–6, 6–12, 4–8, 5–10, 3–6-9, 1–6-12) until global analysis of data collected at different initial concentrations and speeds indicated a best fit model as evaluated by randomness of the residuals and minimization of the variance. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the data collected in 5 mm Mg2+ATP are well described by a distribution containing trimeric, hexameric and dodecameric species (Equation 2), where the hexamer is the predominant species (>90%). Similar results were obtained in buffers containing 1 mm Mg2+ATP, where the best fit model contained monomeric, hexameric and dodecameric species. In all data sets, global fits to sedimentation equilibrium data indicated the predominant species (>90%) to be a hexameric oligomer of NSF. Similar results were independently obtained by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation with the NSF preparations used for the TEM and STEM analyses shown below. 2R. Jaenicke and A. Lustig, personal communication. Attempts to estimate equilibrium constants describing the relationship between the trimeric, hexameric, and dodecameric species from data collected in buffer containing 5 mm Mg2+ATP were unsuccessful, since fits to models containing equilibrium constants showed increased variances as well as systematic deviations in the residuals. This suggests that the hexamer is not in a reversible equilibrium with either the trimeric or dodecameric species on the time scale of the sedimentation equilibrium experiment. Consistent with this conclusion, dilution of NSF samples from the ∼10 μm concentration used in these equilibrium centrifugation experiments to ∼200 nm in sedimentation velocity experiments (see below) did not change the sedimentation coefficient. Moreover, dilution to ∼100–500 nm for electron microscopy (16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) (see below) did not change the abundance or appearance of hexameric cylinders. Thus, sedimentation equilibrium shows NSF to be a stable hexamer, not trimer, in solution. Each 85-kDa NSF subunit consists of three primary domains termed N, D1, and D2 (14Wilson D.W. Wilcox C.A. Flynn G.C. Chen E. Kuang W.J. Henzel W.J. Block M.R. Ullrich A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 15Tagaya M. Wilson D.W. Brunner M. Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of the D1-D2 and the D2 domains showed ring-shaped structures similar to those formed by full-length NSF (16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Since the D2 domain appears to be essential for NSF's oligomerization (12Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 39Matveeva E.A. He P. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26413-26418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) we examined its oligomeric state by sedimentation equilibrium which yielded the data shown in Fig. 2. In buffer containing 0.2 mm Mg2+ATP, the predominant species in solution is a D2 hexamer. The presence of ATP appears to be essential for hexamer formation and/or stabilization, since these hexamers were destabilized in samples from which ATP had been removed by gel filtration (data not shown). The present findings are thus consistent with earlier studies demonstrating oligomerization of the D2 domain (12Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 39Matveeva E.A. He P. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26413-26418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and confirm a direct role of both ATP binding to the D2 domain and of this domain's oligomerization in organizing NSF's hexameric structure. The observation that hexameric NSF is the predominant species in solution does not agree with previous sedimentation equilibrium studies in which NSF was shown to be trimeric (12Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In both studies, however, the same protein construct (His6-NSF-Myc) and similar purification steps were used. In an effort to compare the NSF samples evaluated in this study with the material analyzed in previous studies, the sedimentation coefficient of NSF was measured by velocity sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation. All experiments yielded data described by a s20,w0 of 13.4 (±0.1) S, regardless of whether Mg2+ADP, Mg2+ATP, or Mg2+ATPγS was included in the buffer (see Fig. 3 A). This sedimentation coefficient is consistent with the previously reported value of 12.9 S as well as with the analysis of NSF's sedimentation relative to standards through glycerol gradients (12Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 19Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). A sedimentation coefficient of 13.4 S is low for a 510-kDa protein (the hexameric molecular mass of His6-NSF-Myc) considering that the predicted s max values for a spherical protein of equivalent mass and partial specific volume would be 20.1 S (anhydrous) and 18.5 S (hydrated, where δ = 0.4071, calculated from NSF's amino acid composition). Such a low sedimentation coefficient suggests that NSF's frictional coefficient may be unusually high. Electron microscopy indicated that NSF consists of a ∼13 × 10-nm hollow cylinder with a larger surface area and increased subunit flexibility relative to that expected for a sphere of the same mass and density (16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). This difference in size and shape would indeed be expected to increase the frictional coefficient and decrease the sedimentation coefficient. To determine whether the hexagonal ring shape could explain the low sedimentation coefficient, we constructed several simple models for NSF's shape and defined their hydrodynamic properties using HYDRO (26Garcia de la Torre J. Navarro S. Lopez Martinez M.C. Diaz F.G. Lopez Cascales J.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 530-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The models were built using the minimum number of beads required to form the hexagonal structures observed in EM images of NSF oligomers either in Mg2+ATPγS or in Mg2+ADP (16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) and are described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” Although the S value predicted for the ATP bead model (13.8 S, where δ = 0.4071) agrees fairly well with the experimental sedimentation coefficient (13.4 S), the value predicted for the ADP bead model (15.9 S, where δ = 0.4071) is too high and can only approximate the experimental S value if δ = 0.9–1.2, an unusually high value for hydration. Thus, although the sedimentation coefficient is significantly reduced by NSF's hexagonal ring shape, the shapealone cannot explain the abnormally low S value as long as standard estimates of hydration are assumed. Additional experimentation, such as small angle x-ray scattering, will be required to further evaluate NSF's structure in solution. Sedimentation velocity analysis can be extended using a time-derivative method which provides a means to simultaneously determine the apparent sedimentation, s app, and diffusion,D app, coefficients, from which the molecular weight can be calculated (25Stafford III, W.F. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: M-Pos452Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Even though both coefficients are hydrodynamic measures of a macromolecule, the ratio s/D is proportional to the molecular weight by the Svedberg equation where the hydrodynamic shape and hydration factors inherent in each coefficient cancel. Fig. 3 B shows such an analysis of NSF sedimentation velocity data collected in 5 mm Mg2+ADP. Using Equations 4 and 5 we calculated an s app of 8.43 S and aD app of 1.50 Ficks. When combined in the Svedberg equation, these yielded a solution molecular mass of 504 kDa. This value is within 2% of NSF's calculated hexameric molecular mass. Recent quick-freeze/deep-etch EM showed that NSF and its domain mutants have dimensions and a 6-fold symmetry consistent with a hexagonal, and therefore possibly hexameric, structure (16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Analysis of negatively stained NSF oligomers by TEM and image processing (Fig. 4) was used to confirm this 6-fold symmetry. Top view projections of NSF prepared in 1 mmMg2+ATP were aligned and subjected to principle component analysis (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The molecules were classified using the most significant eigenvectors which represented the symmetry properties of the particles. The averages obtained from these particles demonstrated an apparent 6-fold symmetry which was enhanced by rotational symmetrization (Fig. 4,inset). According to this average, negatively stained NSF oligomers had a diameter of ∼13 nm, consistent with a previously reported measurement (33Whiteheart S.W. Kubalek E.W.

Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The TEM images also show NSF to contain a central electron-dense region with a diameter of 2–3 nm representing a stain-filled pore or cavity (Fig. 4). STEM mass analysis of unstained, freeze-dried NSF particles confirmed a hexameric structure. This technique enables mass measurements of individual macromolecules that are independent of their hydrodynamic properties (10Block M.R. Glick B.S. Wilcox C.A. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7852-7856Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 11Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). All experiments with NSF (His6-NSF-Myc preparations 1 and 2) yielded mass histograms which exhibited a Gaussian distribution with a single well defined peak at 459–497 kDa (Fig. 5 A; histograms not shown), consistent with the presence of a hexamer. There was no detectable shoulder or peak in the 200–300 kDa region of the histograms which would have indicated the presence of significant amounts of a stable NSF trimer. In addition, a series of experiments allowed us to examine the effects of chemical cross-linking and freeze-thawing on NSF's oligomeric state. Comparison of NSF samples prepared and treated in different ways (Fig. 5 A) showed that glutaraldehyde stabilization, freeze-thawing, and additional purification did not significantly alter the measured mass. Within experimental variability, all experiments gave equivalent results showing the presence and predominance of the NSF hexamer. Pooling the data from all experiments using one NSF preparation (preparation 2) yielded the histogram shown in Fig. 5 B, with a mass for NSF of 475 ± 91 kDa (n = 4262). The finding that NSF is predominantly a hexamer in solution was further supported by multiangle light-scattering experiments. This technique offers an additional shape-independent approach for the determination of molecular mass (38Wyatt P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Most NSF elutes from size-exclusion columns slightly ahead of the 440-kDa ferritin standard, implying a molecular mass consistent with a hexameric state (16Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows a typical gel-filtration elution profile of NSF together with an in-line multiangle light-scattering molecular mass determination. The predominant NSF species, averaged across the peak center (width at half height), is calculated by multiangle light scattering to be 489 (± 5) kDa. This value corresponds well to the predicted hexameric molecular mass of 510 kDa. A smaller peak eluting later consists of an 85 (± 3)-kDa species, which corresponds to monomeric NSF. Distinct peaks of other possible NSF oligomers are not observed in 1 mmMg2+ATP. Since the NSF used in these experiments had its amino-terminal His6 tag removed (see “Experimental Procedures”), this result also rules out the unlikely possibility that the His6 tag itself is responsible for NSF's hexameric oligomeric state. Analytical ultracentrifugation, transmission electron microscopy with image processing, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering all reveal that NSF is a hexamer. This result differs from previously published experiments which suggested that NSF was a trimer (12Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It remains unclear why the prior sedimentation equilibrium experiments are not consistent with the current data. The sedimentation equilibrium experiments described here were confirmed in three independent laboratories with equivalent results, supporting a hexameric structure (Fig. 1).2Additional evidence for the previously proposed trimeric structure was provided by the presence of dimeric and trimeric products in cross-linking experiments (12Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, several factors including inefficient cross-linking, low sensitivity of Coomassie staining, and exclusion of high molecular weight complexes from the SDS-polyacrylamide gels used for analysis could have prevented the detection of higher order oligomers (tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers)."

Although the inhibition by nucleotides is well established, the activation by fatty acids is still controversial. It has been reported that the ADP/ATP carrier, and possibly other members of the mitochondrial carrier family, mediate fatty acid uncoupling of mitochondria from a variety of sources by facilitating the transbilayer movement of the fatty acid anion. Brown fat mitochondria are known to be more sensitive to fatty acid uncoupling, a property that has been assigned to the presence of UCP1. We have analyzed the transport properties of UCP1 and conclude that fatty acids are not essential for UCP1 function, although they increase its uncoupling activity. In order to establish the difference between the proposed carrier-mediated uncoupling and that exerted through UCP1, we have studied the facility with which fatty acids uncouple respiration in mitochondria from control yeast and strains expressing UCP1 or the mutant Cys-304 → Gly. The concentration of free palmitate required for half-maximal activation of respiration in UCP1-expressing mitochondria is 80 or 40 nm for the mutant protein. These concentrations have virtually no effect on the respiration of mitochondria from control yeast and are nearly 3 orders of magnitude lower than those reported for carrier-mediated uncoupling. We propose that there exist two modes of fatty acid-mediated uncoupling; nanomolar concentrations activate proton transport through UCP1, but only if their concentrations rise to the micromolar range do they become substrates for nonspecific carrier-mediated uncoupling.

The ability of long-chain fatty acids to uncouple mitochondrial respiration from ATP synthesis (see Ref. 1Pressman B.C. Lardy H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 21: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 2Wojtczak L. Schönfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) has been generally assumed to resemble that of other weak acids, which can permeate through the lipid bilayer in both protonated and unprotonated forms. However, recent data have established that fatty acid anion flip-flop across the phospholipid bilayer occurs far too slowly (t > 1 min) (3Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11367-11370Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) to allow the anion to complete a classic protonated/deprotonated cycle as for classical uncouplers. The protonophoric activity observed when extremely high fatty acid concentrations (above 0.1 mm) are employed is probably caused by the disruption of the lipid bilayer in a detergent-like mode (1Pressman B.C.

Acta. 1978; 503: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), inasmuch as, for example, effects are not reversed by albumin. The situation is less clear when lower fatty acid concentrations are employed and detergent effects are negligible. It has been shown recently that, under these conditions, fatty acid uncoupling becomes sensitive to inhibitors such as carboxyatractylate, and consequently it has been proposed that permeation of the fatty acid anion is mediated by the ADP/ATP carrier (6Andreyev A.Yu.

The thermogenic mechanism is centered around the brown fat uncoupling protein (UCP1),which allows dissipation of the proton electrochemical potential gradient and therefore uncouples respiration from ATP synthesis (12Nicholls D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 13Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Ernster L. New Comprehensive Biochemistry: Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. 23. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 385-420Google Scholar). Recently, three new uncoupling proteins have been identified with homology to UCP1 and termed UCP2 (14Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar), UCP3 (15Vidal-Puig A. Solanes G. Grujic D. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), and StUCP (16Laloi M. Klein M. Riesmeier J.W. Müller-Röber B. Fleury C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Nature. 1997; 389: 135-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Free fatty acids, liberated by the noradrenergic stimulation of lipolysis, are the substrate for brown fat thermogenesis and also act as the cytosolic second messengers by which noradrenaline activates UCP1 (17Locke R.M. Rial E. Scott I.D. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Locke R.M. Rial E. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which fatty acids activate UCP1 is a matter of debate. Two main hypothesis are current. The first is an extension of the observation of carboxyatractylate-sensitive mitochondrial fatty acid uncoupling, and proposes that UCP1 and other mitochondrial anion carriers (19Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 20Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Krämer R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) can catalyze the transport of the fatty acid anion (21Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli M. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 22Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The second model proposes that fatty acids act as a prosthetic group in UCP1 delivering protons to a site from which they are translocated to the other side of the membrane (23Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anion transporting activity would have little physiological importance and thus would be a vestige of its evolutionary relationship with the rest of mitochondrial metabolite carriers. The present report will examine the characteristics of fatty acid-mediated uncoupling of yeast mitochondria expressing recombinant UCP1. Two questions are addressed. First, does UCP1 function in the absence of both nucleotides and fatty acids? Second, what is the difference between UCP1-mediated uncoupling and that mediated by other carriers? We conclude that UCP1 retains the capacity to transport H+(OH−) in the absence of fatty acids and that fatty acids activate UCP1 at much lower concentrations than are required for other mitochondrial carriers. The coding sequences for wild type UCP1 and the mutant Cys-304 → Gly were introduced in the pYeDP-1/8–10 vector as described previously (24González-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Arechaga I. Zaragoza P. Levi-Meyrueis C. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gene expression was under the control of thegal10-cyc1 promoter, induced by galactose and repressed by glucose. The diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303 was transformed by electroporation, and clones containing the expression vector were plated on SD minimal medium (2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.1% casamino acids, 20 mg/liter tryptophan, 40 mg/liter adenine, 2% agar) and selected for uracil autotrophy. Control yeasts (UCP−) contained the same vector but with the UCP1 cDNA in the inverse orientation (25Arechaga I. Raimbault S. Prieto S. Levi-Meyrueis C. Zaragoza P. Miroux B. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For preparation of mitochondria, yeast were incubated aerobically at 28 °C in SP medium (0.1% glucose, 2% lactic acid, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.12% (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% casamino acids, 20 mg/liter tryptophan, 40 mg/liter adenine, pH 4.5), and 14 h before harvesting were transferred to SG medium (2% galactose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.1% casamino acids, 20 mg/liter tryptophan, 40 mg/liter adenine). Mitochondria were isolated from protoplasts as described previously (25Arechaga I. Raimbault S. Prieto S. Levi-Meyrueis C. Zaragoza P. Miroux B. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 0.65 m mannitol, 0.5 mm phosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 32 μm bovine serum albumin (fatty acid content 0.01%,i.e. molar ratio of fatty acid/albumin approximately 0.04), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm Tes, 1The abbreviation used is: Tes,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. pH 6.8, to a final concentration of 15–20 mg/ml protein. The sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to fatty acids was evaluated from the effect of varying palmitate:albumin ratios on the NADH oxidation rate. For respiration assays, mitochondria (0.15 mg/ml protein) were incubated at 20 °C in a buffer containing 0.6 mmannitol, 10 mm phosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acid content 0.01%), 10 mmTes, pH 6.8. Respiration was initiated by addition of 3 mmNADH. Other additions are described in the text and/or figure legends. Mitochondrial buffers and stock palmitate and nucleotide solutions were prepared fresh every day. Protein was determined by the Biuret method using albumin as standard. Palmitate binding to yeast mitochondria was determined under conditions identical to those maintained during respiration experiments. Mitochondria (0.15 mg/ml) were added to respiration buffer that also contained 40 nm [9,10-3H]palmitate (1.5 μCi/ml) and 0.4 μCi/ml [14C]sucrose. 90 s after the addition of NADH, two aliquots were withdrawn and spun for 1 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Subsequently, palmitate additions were made to achieve the desired molar ratio to albumin and left to incubate for another 90 s before two additional aliquots were withdrawn and centrifuged. This period was sufficient to measure an stable rate of respiration in a parallel experiment in the oxygen electrode. To investigate the removal by albumin of membrane-bound palmitate, 140 μm palmitate was added to an aliquot of stock mitochondria (adjusted to 10.5 mg/ml protein), mixed for 30 s and then added to respiration buffer to give a final concentration of 0.15 mg/ml protein. NADH was then added, and, after another 2 or 4 min, aliquots were withdrawn and spun. Supernatants were removed immediately after centrifugation and pellets dissolved in 25 μl of 5% SDS. Radioactivity was determined both in pellets and the original incubation and from these data bound palmitate determined. Two to three independent experiments were performed with each strain (UCP−, UCP+, and Cys-304 → Gly); because there were no significant differences, the binding data were pooled. Unbound palmitate was estimated from the isotherms for the binding of palmitate to bovine serum albumin described in Ref. 26Richieri G.V. Anel A. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7574-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar. In order to establish how the presence of UCP1 modifies the bioenergetic properties of mitochondria, it is necessary to characterize appropriate controls without UCP1. This has been performed previously with warm- and cold-acclimated animals because the brown fat mitochondria of the two appear only to differ in their UCP1 content (18Locke R.M. Rial E. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Cunningham S.A. Wiesinger H. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Rial E. Nicholls D.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The recombinant expression of UCP1 in yeasts allows not only the comparison of mitochondria incorporating UCP1 with appropriate negative controls but also the use of mutants to further characterize transport functions. We have recently described that mutations in the C-terminal end of the protein modify the K m for the activation of ion transport by fatty acids (24González-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Arechaga I. Zaragoza P. Levi-Meyrueis C. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We will use one of these mutants, Cys-304 → Gly, to re-examine the transport properties of UCP1 both in the presence and absence of fatty acids. We have reported previously (24González-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Arechaga I. Zaragoza P. Levi-Meyrueis C. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that, when mitochondria are isolated from yeasts expressing wild type UCP1 (UCP+ strain), they demonstrate diminished coupling relative to those from control yeast containing antisense UCP1 cDNA (UCP− strain). Thus, the respiratory control ratio was 2.67 ± 0.07 (n = 12) for UCP− and 1.75 ± 0.03 (n = 28) for UCP+. GDP addition lowers the state 4 rate by 33 ± 1.7% (n= 17) in UCP+ mitochondria, consistent with an inhibition of the uncoupling protein, while having no effect in UCP−mitochondria. The -fold stimulation by FCCP in UCP− is 5.1 ± 0.6 (n = 12), a value close to that observed in UCP+ if GDP is present (4.6 ± 0.2,n = 5). We can conclude that differences in bioenergetic properties between the two yeast strains are consistent with the presence of active UCP1. A fundamental question is whether the lower coupling observed with UCP+ mitochondria in the absence of external nucleotides is due to UCP1 activity stimulated by endogenous fatty acids or if it represents the basal, fatty acid-independent, H+(OH−) transport activity of the carrier. The conditions used for the isolation of yeast mitochondria and assay of respiration have been designed to minimize the presence of free fatty acids. Thus, the isolation buffer contains 32 μm bovine serum albumin (less than 0.04 mol of fatty acid/mol of albumin) and mitochondria are diluted 70–100 times when added to the oxygen electrode chamber where the albumin concentration is 16 μm. To eliminate the remote possibility that the tight binding sites on the albumin present in the respiration buffer become rapidly saturated with endogenous fatty acids from the mitochondrial stock, we evaluated the effect on the state 4 rate of higher albumin concentrations in the incubation medium. No further reduction in respiration was observed when up to three successive additions of albumin (final concentrations of 32, 48, and 64 μm) were made (data not shown). It is conceivable that a fraction of the endogenously generated fatty acids remain tightly associated with the membrane and not readily removable by albumin. To investigate this possibility, it is first necessary to analyze the characteristics of the partition of palmitate between albumin and the lipid bilayer. Fig. 1 A shows the binding of palmitate to yeast mitochondria using different palmitate:albumin molar ratios to buffer the concentration of free palmitate. Experiments were performed under conditions identical to those used in respiration experiments, except for the presence of radioisotopes. When the palmitate:albumin molar ratio was varied from 1:1 to 5:1, mitochondrially bound palmitate increased from 0.8 to 19 nmol/mg. The concentration of unbound palmitate is extremely low over this range; using the palmitate/albumin binding constants obtained by Richieriet al. (26Richieri G.V. Anel A. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7574-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), mitochondrially bound palmitate correlated linearly with the free palmitate, which varied from 5 to 98 nm (Fig. 1 B). The second step was to obtain a maximal estimate of the endogenously bound fatty acids. For this purpose, [3H]palmitate (140 μm final concentration) was added to the mitochondrial stock at a molar ratio of 4.5:1 palmitate:albumin in order to saturate the high affinity sites present in albumin and thus mimic mitochondria maximally contaminated with endogenous fatty acid. This concentration should not produce detergent-like effects (4Wojtczak L. Zaluska H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 28: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Vaartjes W.J. Van den Bergh S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 503: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were then diluted 69-fold in respiration buffer containing 16 μm albumin to decrease the palmitate:albumin ratio to 0.12:1. Residual membrane-bound palmitate was determined 2 and 4 min after NADH addition, which is the time interval generally used to measure the state 4 respiration rate. The residual bound palmitate amounted to 0.77 ± 0.08 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein after 2 min, and this was further lowered to 0.54 ± 0.05 nmol/mg after 4 min. The state 4 rates measured with these palmitate pre-treated mitochondria were identical to those observed with untreated mitochondria: 177 ± 6 versus 185 ± 6 nmol of “O” min−1 mg−1 (n = 11 and 6), respectively. It is evident, therefore, that under our standard conditions any residual fatty acids bound to the mitochondrial membrane will be equal to or less than that found after palmitate. The final question is whether any residual bound fatty acids would be sufficient to cause significant activation of UCP1. In order to answer this, we determined the concentrations of bound palmitate required to stimulate respiration in our yeast strains. Fig. 2 shows the stimulation of respiration obtained with the same range of palmitate:albumin ratios. The amount of bound palmitate required to observe a half-maximal stimulation of respiration in UCP+ mitochondria is 15 ± 4.8 nmol/mg. These data are in excellent agreement with those published previously by Cunningham et al. (27Cunningham S.A. Wiesinger H. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), where the apparentK m for the uncoupling of pyruvate oxidation in brown fat mitochondria from the guinea pig was 10–20 nmol/mg. Even if the endogenous fatty acids that cannot be removed by albumin amounted to 0.5 nmol/mg (as in the isotopic experiment), they would stimulate state 4 respiration by less than 3%. However, because under these conditions the GDP-sensitive respiration amounts to 33% of the state 4 rate, it is clear that this conductance cannot be attributed solely to fatty acids and must represent a fatty acid-independent mode of proton conductance. We can confirm this assumption by using the Cys-304 → Gly mutant, which, according to a previous report, is stimulated with lower palmitate concentrations than UCP+ (24González-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Arechaga I. Zaragoza P. Levi-Meyrueis C. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that the apparent K m for the activation for palmitate with this mutant is lowered to 7.5 ± 0.8 nmol/mg. If the observed initial state 4 rate were to depend on the endogenous fatty acids, we should observe that Cys-304 → Gly mitochondria are more uncoupled. However, data are identical to those observed with UCP+mitochondria, with a respiratory control ratio of 1.73 ± 0.07 (n = 8) and GDP inhibition of the state 4 respiration of 32.5% ± 1.09 (n = 10). We must therefore conclude that the uncoupling activity observed cannot be attributed to endogenous fatty acids and therefore UCP1 must catalyze the direct transfer of H+(OH−). Recent publications have established that the ADP/ATP carrier can also contribute to the uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration induced by fatty acids (6Andreyev A.Yu. Bondareva T.O. Dedukhova V.I.

Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because we now have the protein incorporated into recombinant yeast mitochondria, we can test the UCP1-independent uncoupling and compare it to that in its presence. It is to be expected that the other transporters of the mitochondrial inner membrane are present in equal amounts in both cases. The yeast are grown under aerobic conditions, and thus mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is fully operative. Fig. 2 shows the effect on respiration of the same range of palmitate:albumin ratios, and it becomes apparent that UCP− mitochondria are far less sensitive to palmitate. It should be noted that, in UCP− mitochondria, the palmitate-stimulated respiration is not sensitive to atractylate over the range 10–40 μm, concentrations that do prevent ADP phosphorylation (data not shown). Recently, it has been demonstrated that oleate uncouples S. cerevisiae mitochondria at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 μm and this uncoupling could be partially inhibited by bongkrekate (9Polcic P. Sabová L. Kolarov J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We conclude that fatty acids stimulate proton transport via the UCP1 at concentrations far lower than those required for carrier-mediated translocation of the fatty acid anion. Therefore, the appearance of UCP1 in the brown adipocyte would confer upon these cells a high thermogenic activity in response to low free fatty acid concentrations. The acute control of energy dissipation in brown fat mitochondria has been a subject of debate for more than two decades, preceding the discovery of UCP1 and yet to be resolved. It was recognized in the late 1960s that brown fat mitochondria prepared by conventional methods were uncoupled and that special conditions were needed to observe efficient oxidative phosphorylation, namely removal of endogenous fatty acids and addition of purine nucleotides (29Rafael J. Ludolph H.-J. Hohorst H.-J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1969; 350: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Hohorst H.-J. Rafael J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1968; 349: 268-270PubMed Google Scholar). The mode of action of purine nucleotides has been less controversial than that of fatty acids. Nucleotides bind to UCP1 from the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial inner membrane and inhibit its transport activity (31Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The role of fatty acids in the regulation of energy dissipation and their mechanism of action have been the subjects of continuous controversy. The first question that is addressed in the present paper relates to the basal activity of UCP1. The earliest studies on the bioenergetic properties of brown adipose tissue mitochondria established that brown adipose tissue mitochondria were uncoupled in the absence of both nucleotides and fatty acids (29Rafael J. Ludolph H.-J. Hohorst H.-J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1969; 350: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Hohorst H.-J. Rafael J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1968; 349: 268-270PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent reports have questioned these findings by suggesting that simple removal of fatty acids is sufficient to abolish H+ transport and consequently that fatty acids are obligatory for UCP1 activity (23Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A separate report (32Jezek P. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26184-26190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) questioned the interpretation of nonrespiring swelling experiments performed in potassium acetate plus valinomycin, which requires H+(OH−) movement for charge and pH balance, by claiming that the rate observed in the absence of fatty acids was due to acetate anion transport through the UCP1, although this explanation fails to account for the high proton conductance of respiring brown adipose tissue mitochondria in the presence of albumin calculated from the proton current and proton electrochemical potential (33Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Results presented in this paper demonstrate that there is a GDP-sensitive conductance that cannot be attributed to endogenous fatty acids, and that an increased affinity for palmitate in a UCP1 mutant does not result in an increased basal activity. The conclusion is that fatty acids are not essential for UCP1 function, although they increase its uncoupling activity. It should be stressed at this point that, if experiments are performed with low and/or transient diffusion potentials, rather than during respiration, UCP1 activity in the absence of fatty acids may not be detected, because in the absence of nucleotide the H+(OH−) transport rate depends linearly on the driving force (33Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ability of fatty acids to uncouple mitochondrial respiration has been known for decades (see Ref. 1Pressman B.C. Lardy H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 21: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 2Wojtczak L. Schönfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) but was generally considered “nonspecific,” relying on the translocation across the bilayer of the fatty acid in both protonated and in anionic forms and additionally, at high concentrations, on detergent-like effects. In 1988, Skulachev and co-workers (6Andreyev A.Yu. Bondareva T.O. Dedukhova V.I. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P. Volkov N.I. FEBS Lett. 1988; 226: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) demonstrated that carboxyatractylate inhibited the uncoupling effect of palmitate in liver mitochondria and thus proposed that the protonophoric effect of fatty acids was mediated by the ADP/ATP carrier facilitating the translocation of the fatty acid anion. This finding has been supported subsequently by other laboratories, both with intact mitochondria (9Polcic P. Sabová L. Kolarov J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,34Schönfeld P. Jezek P. Belyaeva E.A. Borecky J. Slyshenkov V.S. Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and in reconstituted systems (8Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27329-27336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that other members of the family of mitochondrial transporters also appear to participate in this protonophoric action of fatty acids (10Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,11Samartsev V.N. Smirnov A.V. Zeldi I.P. Markova O.V. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A general model is now emerging, wherein all these carriers, including UCP1, facilitate the transbilayer movement of the fatty acid anion. The protonophoric cycle would be completed with the flip-flop across the bilayer of the protonated acid (21Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli M. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 22Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 35Jezek P. Modriansky M. Garlid K.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This H+ cycling mechanism would be analogous to the uncoupling by weak acid protonophores. These data would appear to question the specificity of the fatty acid uncoupling of brown fat mitochondria. However, in all the reports involving the mitochondrial carriers, the unbound fatty acid concentrations required to observe uncoupling are in the micromolar range (6Andreyev A.Yu. Bondareva T.O. Dedukhova V.I. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P. Volkov N.I. FEBS Lett. 1988; 226: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Polcic P. Sabová L. Kolarov J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Wieckowski M.R. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Samartsev V.N. Smirnov A.V. Zeldi I.P. Markova O.V. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, for example, in the ADP/ATP carrier of S. cerevisiae mitochondria, the system closest to the one presented in this paper, this form of fatty acid uncoupling requires concentrations in excess of 10 μm (9Polcic P. Sabová L. Kolarov J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper show that the concentration of free palmitate required for half-maximal stimulation of respiration of UCP+mitochondria is around 80 nm, a value that is in perfect agreement with that reported for brown fat mitochondria from cold-adapted guinea pigs (27Cunningham S.A. Wiesinger H. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The extension of the cycling model to the UCP1 has been based mainly on direct measurements of the transport of the fatty acid anion and/or the subsequent H+ delivery across the membrane. Under those conditions, the K mfor the anion is around 20 μm (21Garlid K.D. Orosz D.E. Modriansky M. Vassanelli M. Jezek P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and is thus similar to values obtained with other members of the carrier family. A second model, termed “local H+-buffering,” proposes that the fatty acid acts as a prosthetic group for H+transport and thus the carboxyl group delivers H+ to a site inside UCP1 from which translocation occurs (23Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model would resemble the H+ translocating mechanism in bacteriorhodopsin (23Winkler E. Klingenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2508-2515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lanyi J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We consider that the physiological relevance of the two models can be discriminated by the concentrations (K m) required to observe the effects and may represent two separate functions of the UCP1. Nanomolar concentrations of free fatty acids such as can be generated by noradrenaline-evoked lipolysis within brown adipocytes (27Cunningham S.A. Wiesinger H. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) would activate proton transport by UCP1 by the “local H+-buffering” mechanism. Only if unbound fatty acid concentrations were to rise to several micromolar would they themselves become transportable substrates for the UCP1, and presumably for the other mitochondrial carriers. It is important to recall the physiological context of the brown fat UCP1, which was shown several years ago to confer high sensitivity of intact brown adipocytes to fatty acid uncoupling and to be reversibly activated within adipocytes by endogenously generated fatty acids after noradrenaline stimulation of the cells (27Cunningham S.A. Wiesinger H. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Until similar criteria can be demonstrated for the much less sensitive carrier-mediated uncoupling, the physiological role of the latter, which may provide a mechanistic explanation for what has been known as nonspecific fatty acid uncoupling, remains contentious."

These changes in various cellular compartments are widely regarded as mechanistically linked events in a single “program” in which activation of caspases and proteolysis of intracellular substrates represent a final common pathway leading to cell death. To date there has been very limited exploration of the linkage of this program to the plasma membrane changes, which bring about swift recognition, uptake, and safe degradation of apoptotic cells by phagocytes. Using the mitochondrial inhibitors antimycin A and oligomycin in human monocytic THP.1 cells triggered into apoptosis, we report the uncoupling of plasma membrane changes from other features of apoptosis. These inhibitors blocked increased plasma membrane permeability, externalization of phosphatidylserine, and recognition by two classes of phagocytes but not activation of caspase-3, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA fragmentation. Externalization of phosphatidylserine in apoptotic human leukemic U937 cells was also dissociated from caspase activation. Thus changes governing safe clearance of apoptotic cells may be regulated by an independent pathway to those bringing about caspase activation.

This finding could have important consequences for attempts to manipulate cell death for therapeutic gainin vivo. Apoptosis is a fundamentally important and programmed form of cell death with wide-ranging significance in health and disease (1Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 32: 223-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 2Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death occurs in two phases, an initial commitment phase followed by an execution phase, which is characterized by a series of stereotypic changes including cell shrinkage, plasma membrane alterations, and condensation and fragmentation of chromatin (3Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Internucleosomal cleavage of DNA, demonstrated as a DNA ladder by agarose gel electrophoresis, was originally considered as a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis (4Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar), although it is now considered as a late event in apoptosis, which may be dissociated from early more critical changes (5Cohen G.M. Sun X.-M. Snowden R.T. Dinsdale D. Skilleter D.N. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). These DNA ladders are derived from large fragments of DNA of 30–50 and 200–300 kilobase pairs in length (6Brown D.G. Sun X.-M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3037-3039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A family of at least 10 interleukin-1β-converting enzymes (now known as caspases) (7Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar) appear to be responsible for most of the biochemical changes associated with the execution phase of apoptosis (reviewed in Refs.8Kumar S.

Caspases are cysteine proteases that have an absolute specificity for an aspartic acid in the P1 position of the substrate and cleave important cellular substrates including lamins, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; TPCK,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone; Z-VAD.FMK, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe) fluoromethyl ketone; PS, phosphatidylserine; TSP, thrombospondin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor. and DNA-dependent protein kinase (3Earnshaw W.C.

Cleavage of intact PARP (116 kDa) to its 85-kDa signature fragment is observed in many different types of cells undergoing apoptosis and has also been proposed as a biochemical marker of apoptosis (11Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). Many if not all caspases are capable of cleaving PARP in vitro, but in intact cells it is likely that caspase-3 (CPP32) and caspase-7 (Mch3) are primarily responsible for the cleavage (8Kumar S. Lavin M.F. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 255-267PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar, 12Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). In vivo intact cells dying by apoptosis are usually swiftly recognized and safely cleared by phagocytes. This protects surrounding tissues from exposure to injurious contents leaking from dying cells, which is inevitable in accidental cell death by necrosis (1Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 32: 223-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 13Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Currently, there is only limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that render apoptotic cells recognizable to phagocytes. However, exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), an anionic phospholipid normally confined to the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer, serves as a recognition signal for yet to be characterized PS receptors on certain phagocyte populations (14Fadok V.A.

Med. 1995; 182: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The mechanisms mediating PS exposure are complex but seem to involve activation of caspases (17Vanags D.M. Pörn-Ares M.I.

Another mechanism by which phagocytes recognize cells undergoing apoptosis involves the phagocyte adhesion receptor CD36 co-operating with the αvβ3 vitronectin receptor integrin to bind thrombospondin (TSP), which acts as a molecular bridge between the apoptotic cell and the macrophage (19Savill J. Dransfield I. Hogg N. Haslett C. Nature. 1990; 343: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). We have studied the induction of apoptosis in two human tumor cell lines, THP.1 and U937. Using the mitochondrial inhibitors antimycin A and oligomycin, we now demonstrate for the first time that in THP.1 cells induction of the apoptotic phenotype, characterized by DNA fragmentation and the activation of caspases with ensuing cleavage of PARP, can be dissociated from cell surface changes that result in the phagocytic recognition of apoptotic cells by both the PS and CD36/αvβ3/TSP mechanisms. Similar dissociation of externalization of phosphatidylserine from activation of caspases was also observed in U937 cells. Media and serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (Dorset, UK) except forN-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK, Boehringer-Mannheim UK, Lewes, UK) and benzyloxycarbonyl-valinyl-alanyl-aspartyl (OMe) fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD.FMK, Enzyme Systems Inc., Dublin, CA). Both human monocytic THP.1 cells and human leukemic U937 cells were maintained in suspension culture as described (20, 2l). Apoptosis was induced in THP.1 cells by incubating cells for 4 h with either etoposide or TPCK, whereas U937 cells were incubated for either 3 h with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in combination with cycloheximide or 5 h with etoposide. To assess the effects of the inhibitors on apoptosis, antimycin A, oligomycin (65% oligomycin A), and ZVAD.FMK were added 5 min before the cells were treated with apoptotic stimuli in all experiments except for apoptosis induced by TNF-α in U937 cells, which were pre-incubated with Z-VAD.FMK for 30 min before exposure to TNF-α. Apoptosis in THP.1 and U937 cells (0.5 × 106 cells) was assessed with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (20Zhu H. Fearnhead H.O. Cohen G.M.

PS exposure in apoptotic cells was detected by incubating cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Annexin V (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria) as described (15Martin S.J.

Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured following incubation of the cells for 25 min at 37 °C with the fluorochrome 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (50 nm) (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR), which is retained in mitochondria with a normal membrane potential (24Petit P.X. O'Connor J.E. Grunwald D. Brown S.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). THP.1 and U937 cells (0.5 × 106) were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (25MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Intact PARP (116 kDa) and its apoptotic 85-kDa signature fragment were detected with a rabbit polyclonal (318) or a mouse monoclonal antibody (C2-10) (from Dr. G. Poirier, Laval University, Quebec, Canada). Procaspase-3 and its catalytically active large subunit were detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the p17 subunit of caspase-3 (from Dr. D. Nicholson, Merck Frosst, Quebec, Canada) as described (25MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).

Inflammatory macrophages were elicited into the peritoneal cavity of 8–16-week-old Balb/c mice with 2% Brewer's thioglycollate. Peritoneal exudate cells were harvested 4 days later by peritoneal lavage with balanced salt solution, plated in 96-well plates at 0.1 × 106 cells/well, and cultured overnight in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) before use in the phagocytosis assay. Bone marrow was harvested from Balb/c mice and plated at 0.1 × 106 cells/well in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% conditioned medium from L929 cells as a source of macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Bone marrow macrophages were used in the phagocytosis assay after being cultured for 5–7 days. For the phagocytosis assays, macrophage monolayers were washed, and THP.1 cells (0.5 × 106) in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal calf serum were added to each well. The plates were incubated for 1 h and then washed in ice-cold saline after treatment with trypsin to remove adherent macrophages. After cytospinning the macrophages onto microscope slides, cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and stained with Giemsa dye. Phagocytosis was evaluated by counting 500 macrophages/slide of four replicate slides in each experiment. Results were expressed as the percentages of macrophages that had phagocytosed THP.1 cells. Treatment of THP.1 cells with etoposide, a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, or TPCK, a chymotrypsin-like serine protease inhibitor, induces apoptosis, assessed by an increase in Hoechst 33342 fluorescence (20Zhu H.

Increase in Hoechst fluoresence results from an increased cell permeability of apoptotic cells compared with normal cells (22Ormerod M.G. Sun X.-M. Snowden R.T. Davies R. Fearnhead H. Cohen G.M. Cytometry. 1993; 14: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this study we have also assessed apoptosis using two other flow cytometric methods, i.e. externalization of PS and the percentage of cells with decreased ΔΨm. Externalization of PS is considered to be a general feature of apoptosis induced by many different stimuli and is measured by binding of annexin V, a PS-binding protein (15Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar, 23Koopman G.

A reduction in ΔΨm has also been reported to be an early event in the induction of apoptosis in many different systems (28Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gómez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar, 29Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of THP.1 cells with etoposide (25 μm) or TPCK (75 μm) resulted in a time-dependent induction of apoptosis, as assessed by both PS exposure and decreased ΔΨm (TableI). Although a decreased ΔΨm has been proposed to regulate the externalization of PS (29Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar), in our studies both of these changes demonstrated a similar time dependence irrespective of the apoptotic stimulus (Table I). Thus induction of apoptosis in THP.1 cells is accompanied by an increased Hoechst 33342 fluorescence, externalization of PS, and a decreased ΔΨm.Table ITime-dependent induction of apoptosis by etoposide and TPCK in THP.1 cellsTimeEtoposideTPCKPS exposureLow ΔΨmPS exposureLow ΔΨmh%02.8 ± 0.46.0 ± 0.92.5 ± 0.84.8 ± 1.312.1 ± 0.15.6 ± 1.25.4 ± 2.04.8 ± 1.0210.7 ± 1.917.6 ± 2.818.7 ± 5.112.3 ± 3.8325.0 ± 1.829.0 ± 5.037.8 ± 6.624.7 ± 5.7436.6 ± 4.435.5 ± 6.054.0 ± 3.337.6 ± 2.6THP.1 cells were incubated for up to 4 h with either etoposide (25 μm) or TPCK (75 μm). The percentage of apoptotic cells was then determined by an increase in PS externalization or a decrease in ΔΨm. The data represent the means (± S.E.) of at least three experiments. Open table in a new tab THP.1 cells were incubated for up to 4 h with either etoposide (25 μm) or TPCK (75 μm). The percentage of apoptotic cells was then determined by an increase in PS externalization or a decrease in ΔΨm. The data represent the means (± S.E.) of at least three experiments. To investigate the possible relationship between reduction in mitochondrial ΔΨ and other features of apoptosis such as externalization of PS, we used antimycin A and oligomycin, inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthase, respectively (30Nicholls D.G Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 2. 1992; (and 191–192, Academic Press, London): 132-133Google Scholar). Both antimycin A and oligomycin caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of apoptosis induced by either etoposide or TPCK as assessed either by PS exposure or Hoechst 33342 staining, whereas they had little effect on the decreased ΔΨm (Fig. 1). Neither antimycin A nor oligomycin alone induced apoptosis assessed by PS exposure, Hoechst 33342 staining, or DNA fragmentation (data not shown). Thus these experiments dissociated those features of the apoptotic phenotype assessed by PS exposure and Hoechst 33342 staining from those measured by the changes in ΔΨm. Z-VAD.FMK (50 μm), a cell membrane-permeable inhibitor of caspases, inhibited apoptosis induced by both etoposide and TPCK, as assessed by all three methods (Fig. 1), supporting a role for caspases in the execution phase of apoptosis in THP.1 cells in agreement with our previous observations (20Zhu H. Fearnhead H.O. Cohen G.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J.

These results demonstrated that in this model of apoptosis the activation of caspases occurred upstream of PS exposure, increased Hoechst 33342 staining, and a decrease in ΔΨm. During the execution phase of apoptosis, caspases are activated and cleave cellular substrates, such as PARP (3Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin.

Therefore we wished to examine whether the mitochondrial inhibitors differentially affected the activation of caspases and the cleavage of PARP. Using Western blot analysis, control cells contained almost entirely intact PARP (116 kDa) (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Induction of apoptosis by either TPCK or etoposide was accompanied by the cleavage of PARP to its 85-kDa signature fragment (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2 and 6), which was completely blocked by Z-VAD.FMK (50 μm) (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5and 9), further supporting the involvement of caspases in the execution phase of apoptosis in THP.1 cells. Neither oligomycin nor antimycin A blocked proteolysis of PARP to its 85-kDa fragment following incubation with either TPCK (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4) or etoposide (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8). The cleavage of PARP to its 85-kDa signature fragment, which occurs at a DEVD↓G sequence separating the amino-terminal DNA binding domain and carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of the enzyme (31Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar), suggested the activation of caspase-3 (CPP32) and/or caspase-7 (Mch3). We therefore examined the activation of caspase-3 using an antibody raised against its p17 large subunit. Caspase-3 is usually present in intact cells as an inactive p32 proform (25MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 32Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.-T.

On induction of apoptosis it is initially processed at Asp175 between the large and small subunits yielding a p20 subunit, which is further processed at Asp9 and Asp28 to yield p19 and p17 large subunits, respectively (12Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K.

Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Control THP.1 cells showed the presence of the intact proform of caspase-3 (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Induction of apoptosis with either TPCK or etoposide was accompanied by loss of the proform of caspase-3 together with formation of the catalytically active large subunit of caspase-3 (Fig. 2 B, LS,lanes 2 and 6). Cleavage of caspase-3 was more extensive in response to TPCK compared with etoposide commensurate with the greater induction of apoptosis induced by this stimulus. Z-VAD.FMK, which blocked the induction of apoptosis induced by these stimuli (Fig. 1), almost totally blocked the formation of the large subunit of caspase-3 in cells treated with either TPCK (Fig. 2 B,lane 5) or etoposide (Fig. 2 B, lane 9), although a small amount of a slightly larger immunoreactive fragment (∼p20) was also observed (Fig. 2 B, lane 9), which was catalytically inactive because of the lack of the cleavage of PARP (Fig. 2 A, lane 9). In contrast, neither oligomycin nor antimycin A inhibited the activation of caspase-3 after treatment with either TPCK (Fig. 2 B,lane 3 and 4) or etoposide (Fig. 2 B,lane 7 and 8). Thus oligomycin and antimycin A inhibited the externalization of PS and the increase in cell membrane permeability assessed by Hoechst 33342 staining (Fig. 1 A) but did not inhibit the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP (Fig. 2). To extend these studies, we investigated whether the treatment with antimycin A or oligomycin had interfered with the DNA fragmentation, which occurs late in apoptosis. Etoposide alone induced internucleosomal cleavage of DNA compared with control cells (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and2). Z-VAD.FMK (50 μm) but not antimycin A or oligomycin inhibited etoposide-induced internucleosomal cleavage (Fig. 3, lanes 3–5). TPCK alone induced fragmentation of DNA to large fragments of 30–50, 200–300, and 600–700 kilobase pairs in length in the absence of internucleosomal cleavage (27Zhu H. Dinsdale D. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Z-VAD.FMK but not antimycin A or oligomycin inhibited the formation of these large DNA fragments (data not shown). Thus externalization of PS during apoptosis can also be dissociated from DNA fragmentation. One of the key features of the apoptotic process is the rapid recognition and subsequent phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (1Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 32: 223-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 13Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Because both antimycin A and oligomycin inhibited externalization of PS but not other features of the apoptotic phenotype, we wished to assess whether they also interfered with phagocytic recognition of apoptotic THP.1 cells. Peritoneal and bone marrow macrophages phagocytose apoptotic cells utilizing receptors for PS or thrombospondin (i.e. αvβ3 and CD36), respectively (13Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol.

Exposure of THP.1 cells to the two pro-apoptotic stimuli, etoposide and TPCK, resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells phagocytosed by both peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages (TableII). Z-VAD.FMK, antimycin A, and oligomycin all inhibited the etoposide- and TPCK-induced increases in recognition and phagocytosis by both peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages (Table II). Thus cells displaying many features of apoptosis including DNA fragmentation, processing of caspase-3, and PARP cleavage do not display characteristic cell surface changes, which result in phagocytic recognition and engulfment.Table IIInhibition of phagocytosis of apoptotic THP.1 cells by oligomycin and antimycin ATreatmentPhagocytosisPeritoneal macrophagesBone marrow macrophages%Control3.1 ± 0.91.7 ± 0.5TPCK25.6 ± 5.319.7 ± 2.8TPCK + Z-VAD.FMK4.4 ± 1.13.8 ± 1.1TPCK + oligomycin4.9 ± 1.61.1 ± 0.5TPCK + antimycin A4.5 ± 0.52.4 ± 0.8Etoposide13.0 ± 2.310.7 ± 0.6Etoposide + Z-VAD.FMK5.2 ± 3.02.2 ± 0.3Etoposide + oligomycin3.9 ± 1.61.4 ± 0.5Etoposide + antimycin A3.8 ± 0.51.0 ± 0.1Induction of apoptosis in THP.1 cells was essentially as described in the legend to Table I.

Results were expressed as percentages of macrophages that had phagocytosed THP.1 cells. The data represent the means (± S.E.) of three experiments. To determine whether the phenomenon of dissociation of externalization of PS from other features of the apoptotic phenotype was cell type-specific, we extended the study to human leukemic U937 cells. These cells were treated with two commonly used apoptotic stimuli, etoposide (25 μm) or TNF-α (10 ng/ml) in the presence of cycloheximide (0.9 μm) (17Vanags D.M. Pörn-Ares M.I. Coppola S. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31075-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was induced by both these stimuli, as assessed by externalization of PS, increase in Hoechst 33342 fluoresence, and increase in cells with a decreased ΔΨm(Fig. 4 A). Both oligomycin (5 μg/ml) and antimycin A (30 μm) largely blocked the apoptotic changes induced by either TNF-α or etoposide as assessed either by PS exposure or Hoechst 33342 staining but had little effect on the decreased ΔΨm (Fig. 4 A). Control U937 cells contained almost entirely intact PARP (116 kDa) (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). Induction of apoptosis by either TNF-α or etoposide was accompanied by activation of caspases as assessed by the cleavage of PARP to its 85-kDa signature fragment (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 6). This cleavage was completely blocked by Z-VAD.FMK (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5and 9), further supporting the activation of caspases during apoptosis. Apoptosis, assessed by PS exposure, Hoechst 33342 staining, or PARP cleavage was not induced by either antimycin A or oligomycin alone (data not shown). Neither antimycin A nor oligomycin blocked proteolysis of PARP to its 85-kDa fragment following incubation with either TNF-α (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and4) or etoposide (Fig. 4 B, lanes 7 and8). Thus, these results in U937 cells dissociated those features of the apoptotic phenotype assessed by PS exposure and Hoechst 33342 staining from those measured by the changes in ΔΨm and caspase activation. In this paper we present data demonstrating the dissociation of cell membrane changes leading to phagocyte recognition of cells undergoing apoptosis from other features of this programmed form of cell death. The mitochondrial inhibitors, antimycin A and oligomycin, not only inhibited surface changes of apoptosis, such as PS exposure and recognition by PS-dependent elicited murine peritoneal macrophages but also inhibited surface changes recognized by murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, which use the αvβ3/thrombospondin recognition mechanism (Table II). However, antimycin A and oligomycin did not inhibit caspase-3 activation, cleavage of PARP, DNA degradation, and reduction in ΔΨm (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). These data imply that the surface changes of apoptosis relate to an independent pathway of events, which may be differentially regulated from the activation of “effector” caspases, which are believed to trigger the nuclear and some of the cytoplasmic changes of apoptosis. It has become a widely held view that PS exposure and associated changes, such as increased plasma membrane permeability to Hoechst dye, represent “early” features of a single, coordinately regulated common pathway leading to cell death, whereas DNA degradation is a “late” feature. However, temporal dissociation of membrane changes including PS exposure from other features of apoptosis could also imply that mechanisms regulating the ability of dying cells to be recognized by phagocytes are part of a parallel process, which is potentially independent from other features of the program. This interpretation of the data is strongly supported by the effects of antimycin A and oligomycin reported here. Future studies will need to characterize the pathway by which dying cells display “eat me” signals. The effects of Z-VAD.FMK reported here support previous data implicating caspase activation in externalization of PS (17Vanags D.M. Pörn-Ares M.I. Coppola S. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. J. Biol.

The blockade of this putative “recognition pathway” by antimycin A and oligomycin also provides important clues for its further dissection. A critical role for the mitochondrial release of proteins, such as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c, has been proposed in initiating the apoptotic program including DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3 (34Susin S.A.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). Although antimycin A and oligomycin may affect targets other than their known mitochondrial ones, our results suggest that their interference of mitochondrial function prevents the mitochondrial release of some factor(s), other than cytochrome c or AIF, that directly or indirectly results in exposure of PS. Lastly, our findings could have very important consequences for attempts to manipulate apoptosis for therapeutic gain. In disorders characterized by unscheduled cell loss by apoptosis, such as neurodegenerative disease, potential therapies will not only need to block intracellular pathways leading to engagement of effector enzymes but will also need to interfere with those governing recognition, lest potentially rescued cells are undesirably removed by phagocytes. Conversely, there may be potential for selective triggering of the surface changes of apoptosis in “undesirable” cells (such as cancer cells) so that these are removed by innate mechanisms.

In a screen of proteins expressed in human aortic smooth muscle cells, we identified a novel gene product designated aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP). The ∼4-kilobase human cDNA and its mouse homologue encode 1158 and 1128 amino acid proteins, respectively, that are 85% identical. ACLP is a nonnuclear protein that contains a signal peptide, a lysine- and proline-rich 11-amino acid repeating motif, a discoidin-like domain, and a C-terminal domain with 39% identity to carboxypeptidase E. By Western blot analysis andin situ hybridization, we detected abundant ACLP expression in the adult aorta. ACLP was expressed predominantly in the smooth muscle cells of the adult mouse aorta but not in the adventitia or in several other tissues. In cultured mouse aortic smooth muscle cells, ACLP mRNA and protein were up-regulated 2–3-fold after serum starvation. Using a recently developed neural crest cell to smooth muscle cell in vitro differentiation system, we found that ACLP mRNA and protein were not expressed in neural crest cells but were up-regulated dramatically with the differentiation of these cells. These results indicate that ACLP may play a role in differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Although VSMCs normally exist in a differentiated state, they can dedifferentiate and proliferate in response to certain stimuli. Activation of VSMCs from a contractile and quiescent state to a proliferative and synthetic state contributes to several disease processes, including arteriosclerosis (2Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar). Defining effectors that modulate VSMC function and identifying marker proteins that characterize a given VSMC phenotypic state will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms regulating VSMC differentiation (1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The origins of VSMCs during embryonic development are diverse (reviewed in Refs. 1Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 3Kirby M.L. Waldo K.L. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, and 4Kirby M.L. Waldo K.L. Circulation. 1990; 82: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). During development, VSMCs derive from many cell types, such as local mesodermal precursors and neural crest cells (3Kirby M.L. Waldo K.L. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar,5Noden D.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 1097-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that they express a similar set of smooth muscle cell marker genes, these cell populations can differ in morphology and respond in a lineage-dependent manner to factors such as transforming growth factor-β1 (6Topouzis S. Majesky M.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 430-445Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). An understanding of the complex regulation of smooth muscle cell differentiation requires the identification of proteins involved in this response. In a search for potential markers and regulators of smooth muscle cell growth and differentiation, we identified a novel gene product termed aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP). ACLP contains a signal peptide, a repeating motif, a discoidin-like domain, and a domain with homology to the carboxypeptidases. ACLP is expressed highly in adult aortic smooth muscle cells, as detected by Northern blotting, Western blotting, and in situ hybridization. Also, expression of ACLP increases in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells after serum starvation. Using a recently developed in vitro system that allows the differentiation of multipotential mouse neural crest cells into smooth muscle cells, we show that ACLP is up-regulated dramatically. These results suggest that ACLP may play a role during development in the acquisition by VSMCs of the differentiated phenotype. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) and mouse aortic smooth muscle cells (MASMCs) were isolated by the method of Gunther et al. (7Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) from the thoracic aortas of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and C57Bl/6 mice. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA), and rat A7r5 smooth muscle cells and C2C12 mouse myoblasts were purchased from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). The mouse neural crest cell line Monc-1 was provided by David Anderson (Pasadena, CA). Monc-1 cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated plates as described (8Stemple D.L. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 973-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), with minor modifications (9Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E.S. Hsieh C.-M.

RASMCs, MASMCs, and A7r5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 3.7 g/liter glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 4 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. HASMCs were cultured in M199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. A recombinant E47 fusion protein (N3-SH[ALA]) containing the basic helix loop helix domain of hamster shPan-1 (amino acids 509–646, with mutations R551A, V552L, and R553A) and a heart muscle kinase recognition sequence and FLAG epitope was expressed and purified as described (10Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Blanar M.A. Crossley P.H. Peters K.G. Steingrı́msson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Martin G.R. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5870-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was phosphorylated with heart muscle kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and then used to screen a human aorta λgt11 cDNA expression library (1.5 × 106 pfu; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by interaction cloning (10Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Blanar M.A. Crossley P.H. Peters K.G. Steingrı́msson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Martin G.R. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5870-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A 1450-base pair (bp) cDNA clone that resulted from this interaction cloning was radiolabeled by random priming and used to isolate an ∼2.8-kilobase (kb) cDNA clone from the same human aorta λgt11 cDNA library. Because Northern blotting revealed that the latter was also a partial cDNA clone, we isolated additional 5′ sequences from HASMC RNA by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Life Technologies, Inc.). GenBankTM searches revealed significant homology between the 3′ end of our human ACLP clone and mouse adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1 (AEBP1) (12He G.-P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To isolate the corresponding mouse ACLP cDNA, we synthesized first strand cDNA from C2C12 mouse myoblast total RNA by reverse transcription with the primer 5′-ATCTGGTTGTCCTCAAT-3′, which was designed according to the 5′ end of mouse AEBP1 (12He G.-P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Using the nested primer 5′-TGACTCCATCCCAATAG-3′ and the anchor primer included in the kit for 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we amplified an ∼1400-bp fragment by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This product was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced as described below. The entire open reading frame of mouse ACLP was then amplified from C2C12 RNA by reverse transcription PCR (Expand Long Template PCR System, Boehringer Mannheim) and ligated into pCR2.1. We sequenced the human and the mouse clones by the dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method, using a combination of Sequenase Version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the Thermo Sequenase 33P terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent-labeled cycle sequencing kit with 7-deaza-GTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a Licor (Lincoln, NE) apparatus. Total RNA was obtained from mouse organs by using RNAzol B according to manufacturer's instructions (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). RNA from cultured cells was isolated by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA was fractionated on 1.2% agarose (6% formaldehyde) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (NitroPure, Micron Separations, Westboro, MA). The filters were hybridized with random-primed, 32P-labeled cDNA probes as described (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 14Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2275-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Equal loading was verified by hybridizing the filters to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to 18S ribosomal RNA (15Yoshizumi M. Kourembanas S. Temizer D.H. Cambria R.P. Quertermous T. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9467-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to x-ray film and a phosphor screen, and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager running the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and normalized to 18S. To construct a c-myc-tagged ACLP expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1/ACLP-Myc-His), we amplified the open reading frame of mouse ACLP with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim). We used a 5′ primer containing anEcoRI site (5′-CGGAATTCAGTCCCTGCTCAAGCCCG-3′) and a 3′ primer containing a HindIII site (5′-CGAAGCTTGAAGTCCCCAAAGTTCACTG-3′) to delete the endogenous termination codon. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes and ligated into theEcoRI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His A (Invitrogen). Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1/ACLP-Myc-His by the DEAE-dextran method with minor modifications (16Tan M. Tsai J.T. Lee Y.J. Chen H.C. Shin S.J. Lai Y.H. Perrella M.A. Bianchi C. Higashiyama S. Endege W. Lee M.E. Tsai J.H. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 690-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized, plated onto chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL), and grown for an additional 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and immunostained as described (17Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Endege W.O. Kho C.-J. Jain M.K. Kashiki S. de los Santos R. Lee W.-S.

Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml) and visualized with a fluorescence microscope. To produce a polyclonal anti-ACLP antibody, we subcloned a BamHI toEcoRI fragment of mouse ACLP (encoding amino acids 615–1128) into the pRSET C bacterial expression vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS-competent bacteria (Stratagene), and protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Bacteria were sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl) containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with 8m urea. His-tagged proteins were purified with Talon resin (CLONTECH) and eluted in lysis buffer containing 8m urea and 100 mm ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. Proteins were dialyzed against water and measured with the Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) protein assay reagent, and 100 μg was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. Antiserum was collected, titered against the recombinant protein, and used for immunoblot analysis as described below. Specificity of the antiserum was determined by using preimmune serum and by competition with a recombinant protein. Protein extracts from cultured cells were prepared for Western blotting in extraction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To obtain proteins from mouse tissues, we homogenized individual organs in 25 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid containing protease inhibitors (Complete™, Boehringer Mannheim). Proteins were measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). After 50-μg aliquots had been resolved on 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) in 48 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 39 mm glycine, 0.037% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 20% methanol transfer buffer. Blots were equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 and blocked in the same solution containing 4% nonfat dry milk. Blots were incubated with anti-ACLP serum diluted 1:1000 and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum diluted 1:4000. Membranes were processed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to film. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and their organs were removed and sectioned (19Lee W.-S. Berry M.J. Hediger M.A. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2136-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Probe was prepared, and in situhybridization was conducted as described (19Lee W.-S. Berry M.J. Hediger M.A. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2136-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Lee W.-S. Kanai Y. Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12032-12039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACLP mRNA was detected with a [35S]UTP-labeled antisense riboprobe synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase from a linearized 0.7-kb fragment of ACLP cDNA in pCR2.1. As a control, a sense RNA probe was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase from a linearized ACLP cDNA fragment in pCR2.1. To identify proteins interacting with products of the E2A gene (E12/E47) in VSMCs, we screened a human aorta expression library with a 32P-labeled E47 fusion protein. One truncated clone isolated from this screen (number 11) led to the full-length ACLP clone characterized here. Using in vitrobinding assays, we determined that proteins derived from clone 11, but not from the full-length protein, bound to E12 and E47 (data not shown). The 3935 bp, full-length human ACLP cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1158 amino acids (Fig. 1 A) and a Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of translation (GCCATGG) (21Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) preceded by an in-frame stop codon. The protein has a calculated molecular mass of 130 kDa and an estimated pI of 4.8, and it contains a putative signal peptide sequence (22von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 23Brendel V. Bucher P. Nourbakhsh I.R. Blaisdell B.E. Karlin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), an 11 amino acid lysine- and proline-rich motif repeated four times at the N terminus, a domain with 30% amino acid identity to the slime mold adhesion protein discoidin I, and a C-terminal domain with 39% identity to carboxypeptidase E (Fig. 1 B). GenBankTM searches revealed that the C terminus of human ACLP is highly homologous to mouse AEBP1 (12He G.-P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). AEBP1 was originally identified as an ∼2.5-kb cDNA that hybridized to an ∼4-kb band on Northern blot analysis, and it was predicted to encode a 719 amino acid, 79 kDa protein. The homology between ACLP and AEBP1 suggested two possibilities: either ACLP was a longer member of the AEBP1 gene family, or the AEBP1 sequence was substantially truncated at its 5′-end. To test the two possibilities, we cloned the mouse homologue of ACLP by a combination of 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends and reverse transcription PCR. After sequencing the 3633-bp mouse ACLP cDNA fragment, we found that it encoded an open reading frame (1128 amino acids) similar to that of our human clone, indicating that it is the mouse homologue (the two are 85% identical and 90% similar). Because AEBP1 is identical to the C terminus of the mouse ACLP, we conclude that the AEBP1 cDNA is probably not complete (the start of the AEBP1 sequence is indicated by a bullet in Fig. 1 A). To confirm the putative open reading frame of mouse ACLP, we performed in vitro transcription and translation reactions with the mouse cDNA used as template. Translated products were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a prominent band of ∼175 kDa was detected (Fig. 2 A). To identify the endogenous ACLP, a C-terminal fragment of mouse ACLP was expressed in bacteria, purified, and used to raise antibodies in rabbits. By Western blot analysis, this antibody detected a single band with an apparent mobility of ∼175 kDa in MASMC extracts (Fig. 2 B). The similar migration of the endogenous ACLP and the protein transcribed and translated in vitro indicates that we isolated a full-length cDNA clone. To assess the subcellular localization of ACLP, we generated a mouse ACLP expression construct with a c-myc epitope at the C terminus. The myc epitope was placed at the C terminus so that it would not interfere with signal peptide-mediated processes. This construct was transfected transiently into RASMCs and A7r5 cells, and immunostaining was performed with anti-c-myc antibody 9E10. RASMCs and A7r5 cells (Fig. 3, A and C) both exhibited strong membrane-associated or cytoplasmic staining. Staining was most intense in the perinuclear region and was not observed in the nucleus (Fig. 3, B and D). Although the ACLP cDNA was cloned originally from aortic smooth muscle cells, we also wanted to examine its mRNA and protein expression in other tissues. As expected, levels of ACLP mRNA were high in the whole aorta (including adventitia) (Fig. 4 A). Also, ACLP message was present in other tissues, including the colon and the kidney (Fig. 4 A). To examine expression of ACLP, we subjected extracts from mouse tissues to Western blot analysis. ACLP was expressed abundantly in the mouse aorta (without adventitia) but not in the adventitia, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, or kidney (Fig. 4 B). The presence of ACLP mRNA in the kidney (Fig. 4 A) but absence of protein may indicate translational regulation. To identify cell types expressing ACLP in the adult, we performed in situ hybridization on adult rat aorta and skeletal muscle. The antisense riboprobe detected specific ACLP expression in the smooth muscle cells of the aorta (Fig. 5 A), whereas the control, sense probe did not (Fig. 5 B). As expected, neither the sense nor the antisense probe hybridized to skeletal muscle cells (Fig. 5, C and D).Figure 5Detection of ACLP mRNA in aorta byin situ hybridization. Rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and tissue was removed and sectioned as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sections from aorta (Aand B) and skeletal muscle (C and D) were hybridized with [35S]UTP-labeled antisense (A and C) or sense (B andD) riboprobes. Magnification, × 600.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because ACLP expression was high in the differentiated smooth muscle cells of the aorta (Fig. 3 B), we examined the effect of VSMC growth and differentiation on ACLP expression. MASMCs were cultured for 3 days in 0.4% calf serum containing medium that induces quiescence. RNA and protein extracts were then prepared from the cells and analyzed. ACLP mRNA was more abundant (∼2-fold) in serum-starved MASMCs than in growing controls (Fig. 6 A). In RASMCs, ACLP mRNA was ∼3-fold more abundant in quiescent cells than in their actively proliferating counterparts (Fig. 6 A). ACLP was also elevated in quiescent MASMCs (Fig. 6 B). Although these changes in message and protein levels are modest, they are consistent with increases in VSMC differentiation-specific markers observed in other systems (24Owens G.K. Loeb A. Gordon D. Thompson M.M. J. Cell. Biol. 1986; 102: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 25Li X. Tsai P. Weider E.D. Kribben A. Van Putten V. Schrier R.W. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19653-19658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory recently developed an in vitro system for differentiating smooth muscle cells from Monc-1 cells, a mouse line derived from the neural crest (9Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E.S. Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Stemple D.L. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Monc-1 cells differentiate into smooth muscle cells when medium supplemented with chick embryo extract is replaced with differentiation medium (9Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Chin M.T. Feinberg M.W. Sibinga N.E.S. Hsieh C.-M. Yet S.-F. Stemple D.L. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5993-5996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine ACLP expression during the conversion of undifferentiated Monc-1 cells to smooth muscle, we measured the time course of ACLP expression. ACLP mRNA was nearly undetectable in undifferentiated Monc-1 cells (Fig. 7 A). As the cells differentiated, however, ACLP expression increased until it became marked at days 4 and 6 after the start of differentiation (Fig. 7 A). Under these conditions, induction of ACLP appeared to lag behind that of smooth muscle α-actin, a marker for smooth muscle cells. To compare the level of ACLP in cells treated similarly, we prepared protein extracts from undifferentiated Monc-1 cells and cells allowed to differentiate for 6 days (Fig. 7 B). ACLP was not detectable in undifferentiated Monc-1 cells (day 0) but was expressed highly (day 6) under conditions that promote Monc-1 cell differentiation into smooth muscle cells. The abundance of ACLP in these cells was similar to that in MASMCs. We have cloned a novel cDNA from human aortic smooth muscle cells, termed ACLP, and its mouse homologue. Notable features of the protein include a predicted signal peptide sequence at the N terminus, a lysine- and proline-rich 11-amino acid repeat, a discoidin-like domain, and a large C-terminal carboxypeptidase-like domain (Fig. 1 B). The screen that led to the identification of ACLP was performed to identify binding partners of the E2A proteins. The products of the E2A gene, E12 and E47, serve as heterodimerization partners for tissue specific transcription factors that regulate growth and differentiation in several cell types. Although the E2A gene products are expressed ubiquitously (26Roberts V.J. Steenbergen R.S. Murre C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7583-7587Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a vascular smooth muscle specific heterodimerization partner or transcription factor has not been identified. We cloned the C-terminal portion of human ACLP (amino acids 793–1158) by using a labeled E47 protein probe and verified its binding to E47 by in vitro assays (data not shown). However, the full-length ACLP, because of its predicted signal peptide sequence (Fig. 1) and nonnuclear subcellular localization (Fig. 3), probably does not function as a heterodimerization partner for E47 in vivo. GenBankTM searches indicated high homology between the C terminus of human ACLP and the mouse AEBP1 described by He et al. (12He G.-P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine the relation between ACLP and AEBP1, we cloned the mouse ACLP cDNA. By sequence comparison, AEBP1 was found to be identical to mouse ACLP, beginning at ACLP methionine 410 (Fig. 1 A). We then determined that ACLP is a single-copy gene in the mouse and cloned the region corresponding to the 5′ end of AEBP1 from genomic DNA. 2M. D. Layne and M.-E. Lee, unpublished observations. Analysis of the genomic clone confirmed that the AEBP1 sequence is missing a G residue 11 bases 5′ to the identified ATG. The presence of this G residue in ACLP would eliminate the in frame stop codon proposed by Heet al. (12He G.-P. Muise A. Li A.W. Ro H.-S. Nature. 1995; 378: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and extend the open reading frame. The 2.5-kb AEBP1 cDNA is unlikely to code for an authentic protein. Probes derived from AEBP1 and both the 5′ and 3′ ends of ACLP detected a single, ∼4-kb band by Northern blot analysis, which is consistent with the size of the human as well as the mouse ACLP cloned cDNAs. Because the AEBP1 cDNA contains a putative polyadenylation signal and a poly(A) tail, the difference between the AEBP1 cDNA and mRNA is ∼1.5 kb. This missing 1.5 kb of sequence is present in the 5′ end of the ACLP cDNA. Also, the anti-ACLP antibody generated for these studies was raised from the C terminus of ACLP, which is identical to AEBP1. The antibody detected only a single band of ∼175 kDa by Western blotting in several tissues examined (Fig. 4 B), which is consistent with the mobility of ACLP transcribed and translated in vitro (Fig. 2). We also detected a single band of identical mobility in protein extracts from several cell lines in culture, including 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. ACLP was expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at substantially lower levels than in MASMCs or differentiated Monc-1 cells (data not shown). Thus, AEBP1 appears to be a truncated clone of mouse ACLP. AEBP1 is missing the ACLP signal peptide, repeat domain, and part of the discoidin domain. ACLP has a prominent carboxypeptidase-like domain of about 500 amino acids at its C terminus (Fig. 1 B). This domain is 39% identical to carboxypeptidase E. Despite this high sequence similarity, however, we 3W. O. Endege and M.-E. Lee, unpublished observations. and others (27Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have been unable to demonstrate that this domain of ACLP has any catalytic carboxypeptidase activity. These results may reflect the divergence of specific residues in ACLP from sequences of the carboxypeptidase family (27Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10543-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, a histidine involved in zinc binding in carboxypeptidases is replaced by an asparagine (amino acid 763) in human ACLP. Catalytically important tyrosine and glutamic acid residues in the carboxypeptidases are substituted by asparagine (amino acid 852) and tyrosine (amino acid 874) in human ACLP, respectively. Also, the positively charged arginine residue in the substrate recognition pocket of the carboxypeptidases that stabilizes the C-terminal carboxyl group of the substrate is replaced by a negatively charged glutamic acid residue (amino acid 700) in human ACLP. Although catalytically inactive, ACLP may interact with other proteins via this carboxypeptidase-like domain, as evidenced by our initial isolation of the ACLP cDNA from an expression library screened with a32P-labeled protein probe. Carboxypeptidase E also serves as a sorting receptor in the secretory pathway (28Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.-C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), implicating functions other than catalysis for the carboxypeptidase domain. The second important motif in ACLP is a discoidin-like domain (Fig. 1 B), which has been identified in coagulation factors V and VIII (29Toole J.J. Knopf J.L. Wozney J.M. Sultzman L.A. Buecker J.L.

Discoidin is a lectin produced by the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum and is thought to facilitate cellular aggregation and migration by functioning as fibronectin does in vertebrates (39Springer W.R.

ACLP and many other proteins containing a discoidin-like domain lack the RGD motif important to the function of both discoidin and fibronectin (40Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 28: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The discoidin-like domain may be important for cell-cell recognition, or it may be involved in cell migration mediated through homotypic and heterotypic interactions (36Takagi S. Hirata T. Agata K.

As ACLP lacks a predicted transmembrane-spanning domain (Fig. 1 A), the discoidin-like domain may mediate the interaction of ACLP with the cell membrane. Although ACLP is not expressed in neural crest cells, it is induced markedly during Monc-1 cell to smooth muscle cell differentiation (Fig. 7). This induction of ACLP during Monc-1 differentiation, in conjunction with the preferential expression of ACLP in VSMCs in vivo (Fig. 4), links ACLP expression to the development of the VSMC lineage. Moreover, induction of ACLP by culture medium that confers a differentiated VSMC phenotype (Fig. 6) further suggests a role for ACLP in the differentiation of this cell type.

We report below that the response to glucose in the MIN6 cells includes an activation of the p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (ERK2 and ERK1). This activation also occurred with the antidiabetic sulfonylurea glibenclamide and kainate, a specific agonist of a subtype of the ionotropic glutamate receptors, which depolarize the cytoplasmic membrane. The requirement for a calcium entry through the L-type voltage-gated channels and other characteristics of the regulation of the MAP kinase activity, such as the effect of the elevation of the cAMP concentration by forskolin, were similar to those of the secretion of insulin. However, the activation of the MAP kinases is not required for the secretion of insulin, inasmuch as this effect of glucose was not abolished when the MAP kinases were prevented from activation by PD098059, an inhibitor of the MAP kinase kinase. However, as the MAP kinases were translocated into the nucleus, they might be implicated in the calcium-dependent transcriptional response of the cells to glucose and thus regulate the expression of the insulin gene.

The secretion of insulin by the pancreatic β cells in response to the elevation of the blood glucose level is controlled at the level of insulin synthesis and exocytosis. Insulin synthesis is itself regulated both at the level of transcription and translation. Glucose also exerts a mitogenic effect on the pancreatic β cells through insulin-independent mechanisms. The pancreatic β cells are also regulated by numerous hormones and neurotransmitters such as glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-I (GLP-I), 1The abbreviations used are: GLP-I, glucagon-like peptide I; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MBP, myelin basic protein; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, acetylcholine, or epinephrine, which enable them to respond to different physiological conditions (1Holz G.G.

The signaling pathways mediating the short term action of the secretagogues on the exocytosis and the long term regulation of insulin production are not well understood. However, several enzymatic activities mediating cell signaling have been shown to be regulated by glucose in the pancreatic β cells. Protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipase C, and phospholipase A2 activities regulate insulin secretion in response to glucose (2Arkhammar P. Juntti-Berggren L. Larsson O. Welsh M. Nanberg E. Sjoholm A.

The pivotal role of calcium in the triggering and the regulation of exocytosis in the endocrine cells is well documented (8Clapham D.E.

The mechanisms leading to insulin exocytosis have been shown to depend on the entry of calcium through the voltage-gated calcium channels (1Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic β cells the depolarization that induces the opening of voltage-gated channels is the result of the closure of the KATP potassium channels. The KATP channels, which are sensitive to the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio (with ATP inducing the closure of the channel) are the target of the widely used antidiabetic drug sulfonylureas (such as glibenclamide). Recently, the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases by calcium was demonstrated in several cellular systems (11Bading H. Greenberg M.E.

The MAP kinases p42 and p44, also known as ERK2 and ERK1, are serine/threonine kinases involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and adaptation of many cells to their environment (16Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 236-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The calcium-activated MAP kinase pathway seems at least partially identical to the pathway activated in response to growth factors, a pathway known to involve a MAP kinase kinase (MEK), a MEK kinase, and a small GTPase such as Ras (17Marshall C.J.

Several isoforms of PKC, known as conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ isoforms), are directly regulated by calcium (21Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), and some of them may regulate the MAP kinase pathway (22Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Among the calcium-regulated isoforms, the MIN6 cells express the α and βII isoforms (23Tian Y.M. Urquidi V. Ashcroft S.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 119: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The elevation of the cyclic AMP concentration, which activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase, can either inhibit the MAP kinase activation through Ras/Raf in some systems (24Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T.

The MIN6 pancreatic β cell line was derived from transgenic mice expressing the SV40 T antigen under the control of the insulin promoter. These cells secrete normal levels of insulin, and the kinetics and the dose response of the glucose-induced insulin secretion are similar to the response of the primary cultures of the β islet cells (29Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Interestingly, like the Langerhans β islet cells, this cell line expresses several functional glutamate receptors previously characterized in the central nervous system of mammals (30Weaver C.D. Yao T.L. Powers A.C. Verdoorn T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12977-12984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Hollman M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar). Stimulation of these receptors allows the entry of calcium into the cells and induces insulin secretion (32Gonoi T. Mizuno N. Inagaki N. Kuromi H. Seino Y. Miyazaki J. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16989-16992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the MIN6 cells express the kainate-receptor subunits that allow the formation of the kainate-sensitive sodium/potassium channels. The present work focuses on the regulation of the ERKs/MAP kinases by calcium in response to several secretagogues and the effect of cAMP in a cell line that is very similar to the normal pancreatic islet β cells. The MIN6 cells were cultured as described previously (29Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Before treatment with the different reagents, the cells were washed twice in incubation buffer containing: 124 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm glucose. Before stimulation, the cells were incubated 1 h in this buffer at 37 °C. The stimulation with the different reagents (16 mm glucose, 500 μm kainate, 100 μm glibenclamide, or 100 μm forskolin) was performed at 37 °C and stopped at different times by the removal of the buffer and immediate cell lysis. The cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer containing: 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 158 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmNa3VO4. Where indicated, nifedipine was used at 10 μm, the MEK inhibitor (PD098059) at 50 μm or 100 μm, and PKC inhibitors GF109203X and RO 31–8220 at 1 to 100 μm during preincubation (1 h, 37 °C) and during stimulation. In the calcium-free experiments, after preincubation the cells were incubated for 15 min in a calcium-free medium containing 1 mm EGTA and stimulated in the same buffer. The stimulation with elevated extracellular potassium was done by increasing the potassium concentration to 50 mmand reducing the sodium to 79.6 mm to maintain isotonicity: K50 (79.6 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm glucose). The protein extracts were prepared at 4 °C. After lysis with lysis buffer, the lysates were collected and centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g. The pellets were discarded. Using γ-globulin as a standard, the protein concentration in the supernatants was determined by the Bradford microassay method (Bio-Rad) (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). The protein extracts were either used immediately for Western blotting, or stored at −20 °C before the determination of the MAP kinase activity. Equal amounts of protein (50–100 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 8% or 10% gel and transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated for 1 h with 1% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) to block nonspecific binding. The antibodies used were: the monoclonal 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (a generous gift from Dr Brian Drucker, Oregon University) (1:1000, 1 h, room temperature) or the anti-active ERK antibody (1:20,000; Promega) (this antibody recognizes the dually phosphorylated MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 on the activating sites corresponding to residues 183 and 185 in ERK2); the membrane was extensively washed with TBST and incubated 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako) (1:10,000) and then washed with TBST. The bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Before reprobing, the antibodies were washed away by incubation for 2 h at 65 °C in 200 mm glycine, pH 2.5, containing 1% SDS. The membrane was washed twice with water, twice (5 min) with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, and once (15 min) with TBST and incubated with either (i) the polyclonal anti-MAP kinase antibody 283 (a generous gift from Dr. Marsha Rich-Rosner, Ben May Institute, Chicago, IL) (1:500) (this antibody recognizes p42 and p44 MAP kinases), (ii) the polyclonal anti-ERK2 C-14 antibody (1:1,000; sc154, Santa Cruz) (this antibody recognizes ERK2 and also weakly ERK1), or (iii) the anti-active MAP kinase antibody. The MAP kinase activity was determined at 30 °C in 25 μl of a buffer containing: 75 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 3.75 mm EGTA, 30 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 6 μm KI peptide (cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor), 0.15 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm synthetic peptide (APRTPGGRR) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), corresponding to the major site of phosphorylation of the myelin basic protein (MBP) by MAP kinase, and to which 12.5 μl of cytosolic fractions containing 10 μg of protein was added. The reaction was started with the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (0.25 μCi/assay) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 17 μl of 24% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g, 30 μl of supernatant were spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose papers, the papers were washed four times with 175 mm orthophosphoric acid and transferred to vials, and the radioactivity was counted (34Agbotounou W.K. Mousset S. Piperno S. Pierre M. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Pierre J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Baron C. Benes C. Huynh V.T. Fagard R. Roisin M.P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, the MAP kinase activity was linear with time and protein concentration. The MIN6 cells grown in 2-cm diameter wells at 50% confluence were incubated for 1 h in the incubation buffer containing 3 mm glucose and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then placed in 1 ml of the same buffer containing the different effectors or in 1 ml of 50 mmpotassium buffer. After 1 h, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 5 min), and the insulin content was determined by radioimmunoassay using the Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur or Sorin (INSIK-5) kits. The cells were grown on glass coverslips, and the stimulation was performed as described above; the stimulation was stopped by fixation of cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, at room temperature. The permeabilization was done with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Incubation with a nonimmune goat serum (15 min, room temperature) was followed by 1 h incubation with anti-ERK2 polyclonal antibody (SC154) at a 1:100 dilution. After washing in PBS supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, the secondary fluorescent antibody (fluorescein isithiocyanate-coupled goat antibody, Sigma) was added for 30 min. The final washes were followed by mounting in Vectashield containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC 1000. Addition of glucose to the cells induces the phosphorylation of a 42-kDa protein on tyrosine, which can be shown by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A). The p42 protein can be identified as ERK2 when the blot is reprobed with a polyclonal anti-ERK antibody (anti-p42 and -p44 MAP kinase, respectively, ERK2 and ERK1). The phosphorylation of p42 peaked at 5 min after the addition of glucose, and decreased rapidly to the basal level afterward. The kinetics of the phosphorylation correlated well with the MAP kinase activity, which was measured with a synthetic peptide corresponding to a fragment of the MBP (Fig. 1 C). A more sensitive assay, using an antibody specific for the active biphosphorylated form of ERK1 and ERK2, showed a low level of activation in response to glucose, which lasted at least 5 h (see Fig. 5). The activation was maximal with 16 mm glucose. This concentration is known to induce a maximal secretion of insulin in the pancreatic β cells (29Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). The level of activation was not higher with higher concentrations of glucose (data not shown).Figure 5Forskolin increases the activation of the ERKs by glucose, but not the activation by potassium.

Mizuno N. Inagaki N. Kuromi H. Seino Y. Miyazaki J. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16989-16992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, this stimulation may also affect the MAP kinase activity. Indeed, when the cells were stimulated with kainate, a specific agonist of the kainate receptor (a subtype of the ionotropic glutamate receptors), it increased the phosphorylation of ERK2 (Fig. 1 B). As with glucose, the MAP kinase activity was also increased when measured with the synthetic MBP peptide (Fig. 1 C). The response to kainate was faster and sharper than to glucose, with a peak at 2 min (Fig. 1 C). This transient activation was also detected by immunoblotting with the anti-active ERK antibody (data not shown). To our knowledge, this is the first report of an activation of the ERKs in response to a kainate receptor stimulation in the pancreatic β cells. Kainate is likely to affect the membrane depolarization generated by glucose, so the cells were stimulated by the simultaneous addition of glucose and kainate. In several instances, the resulting activation was over 3 times the basal level, with a peak at 5–8 min (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas the activation by either glucose or kainate alone was just over 1.6 times the basal level (Fig. 1 C and TableI).Table IEffect of EGTA and nifedipine on the MAP kinase activation by glucose and kainateCa2+Ca2+ + NifNo Ca2+ + EGTAGlucose1.65 ± 0.06 (n = 10)0.95 ± 0.06 (n = 3)NDKainate1.60 ± 0.09 (n = 11)1.02 ± 0.05 (n = 3)0.88 ± 0.03 (n = 5)The MIN6 cells were stimulated for 5 min with 16 mmglucose, for 2 min with 500 μm kainate, with or without 10 μm nifedipine (Nif) or 1 mm EGTA.

When the MIN6 cells were stimulated with glucose and/or kainate in the absence of calcium and in the presence of EGTA (1 mm), the ERKs were no longer activated (Fig. 3 and Table I). The glucose-stimulated calcium entry into the cells is known to occur mostly through the L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and it was shown that this entry induces the secretion of insulin (36Rorsman P. Trube G. J. Physiol. 1986; 374: 531-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Incubation of the MIN6 cells with 10 μm nifedipine, a specific inhibitor of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, blocked the activation of the ERKs by glucose and/or kainate (Fig. 3 and Table I). Therefore, the calcium entry through the L-type voltage-gated calcium channels appears to be necessary for the stimulation of the ERKs by glucose and/or kainate. It is known that glucose can by itself initiate a calcium-independent signaling. In order to estimate the involvement of the calcium independent signal in the activation of the ERKs by glucose, the antidiabetic sulfonylurea glibenclamide was used. Glibenclamide blocks the KATP channels (3Eliasson L. Renström E. Ämmälä C. Per-Olof B. Bertorello A.M. Bokvist K. Chibalin A. Deeney J.T. Flatt P.R. Gäbel J. Gromada J. Larsson O. Lindström P.

IRL Press, Oxford1992: 97-150Google Scholar), thus mimicking the depolarizing effect of glucose, which triggers the entry of calcium. When 100 μm glibenclamide was added to the MIN6 cells, the ERKs were phosphorylated (Fig. 4). The activation of the ERKs by glucose was not significantly modified by glibenclamide (Fig. 4 and data not shown). The activation by glibenclamide was also blocked in the presence of EGTA (data not shown). A cell membrane depolarization by an elevated extracellular potassium concentration is known to induce a calcium entry and a MAP kinase activation in several cell lines (12Chao T.S.O. Byron K.L. Lee K.M. Villereal M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19876-19883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rosen L. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 35Frödin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7882-7889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). When the MIN6 cells were stimulated with 50 mm extracellular potassium, the ERKs were rapidly activated (Fig. 4). This activation was larger (8.2 ± 0.54-fold, four independent experiments) than the one induced by glucose or kainate, but it was not sustained, and ended approximately after 1 h (Fig. 5, A andC). The activation of the ERKs by potassium was also blocked by EGTA and nifedipine (data not shown). These results imply that a calcium entry is by itself sufficient to activate the ERKs. The activity of the pancreatic β cells is regulated through several hormone receptors some of which are linked to the activation of adenylate cyclase. For example, GLP-I potentiates insulin secretion in response to glucose (38Mosjov S. Weir G.C. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 79: 616-619Google Scholar). In the presence of a nonstimulating concentration of glucose (3 mm), forskolin (which activates adenylate cyclase) led to a very low activation of the ERKs (Fig. 5). Additionally, when the cells were incubated in the presence of both a stimulating glucose concentration and forskolin, the activation of the ERKs was more than additive. The effect of forskolin was most clearly seen with a 10 mm concentration of glucose (Fig. 5 A, a). However, forskolin also increased significantly the glucose-induced ERK activation, even at the 16 mm optimal glucose concentration (Fig. 5, A andB). Forskolin also had a potentiating effect on the low and sustained ERKs activation that occurred between 1 and 3.5 h (Fig. 5 C). It appears that the elevation of the cytoplasmic concentration of cAMP by hormones such as GLP-I could modulate the activation of the ERKs by glucose. Interestingly, forskolin did not potentiate the stimulation by the potassium-induced depolarization (see Fig. 5 A, b, and “Discussion”). PKC activity is known to play an important role in the secretion of insulin in response to glucose and several isoforms of PKC are regulated by calcium. Two bisindolylmaleimide derivatives, GF109203X and RO31–8220, that are specific inhibitors of PKC were used to investigate its involvement in the activation of the ERKs by calcium in the MIN6 cells. Indeed, the two inhibitors blocked the activation of the ERKs by glucose in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6). PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), which is a direct activator of some isoforms of PKC, was able to activate the ERKs in the MIN6 cells. The activation of the ERKs by PMA was blocked by RO 31–8220 with a concentration dependence similar to that seen with glucose (Fig. 6 A). The activation of the ERKs by a potassium depolarization was also blocked by the two PKC inhibitors within the same range of concentrations (Fig. 6 B, b). These results suggest that the activation of the ERKs by the entry of calcium into the MIN6 cells depends on one or several PKC isoforms. However, due to the high concentrations of the inhibitors used, the possibility that kinases other than PKC were inhibited cannot be excluded. Previous studies on insulin secretion and the results described above show that: (i) secretagogues activate the ERKs, (ii) the maximal activation of the ERKs precedes the maximal initial secretion by 5–8 min, (iii) both the secretion of insulin and the activation of the ERKs depend on the entry of calcium through the L-type voltage-gated channels, and (iv) both responses depend on the activity of PKC. Therefore, the ERKs may be involved in the immediate regulation of insulin secretion. The recently described MEK inhibitor PD098059 (39Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar) was used to test this possibility. Its addition to the MIN6 cells blocked the activation of ERKs by glucose (Fig. 7 A) or potassium (data not shown). However, the secretion of insulin after 1 h in response to glucose or potassium was not affected by it (Fig. 7 B). Thus, it appears that the activation of the ERKs and the secretion of insulin, both of which are triggered by an entry of calcium in response to glucose, become independent at some point in the signaling pathways. Because the activation of the ERKs is not involved in the immediate regulation of insulin secretion and because in other cells the ERKs have been shown to translocate into the nucleus in response to various stimuli, glucose and other secretagogues could also promote a nuclear translocation of the ERKs. The MIN6 cells were stimulated as above, and the subcellular location of ERK2 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 8). In the basal state (3 mmglucose), ERK2 was almost exclusively located in the cytoplasm, and only a very faint nuclear labeling could be seen in a few cells. In response to K50, a clear and rapid translocation of ERK2 into the nucleus was seen by confocal microscopy. Glucose alone or with forskolin also induced the translocation of ERK2 into the nucleus but with a lower efficiency, correlating with the level of the activation of the ERKs induced by the different treatments. Moreover, the translocation induced by glucose was already maximal at 5 min. These results show that the entry of calcium is sufficient to promote a nuclear translocation of the ERKs that may regulate the transcription of the insulin as well as other genes. In this work, three different stimuli, glucose, kainate, and elevated extracellular potassium, are found to stimulate the activity of the ERKs in the MIN6 cells. The fact that such an activation of the ERKs was not previously detected in freshly isolated β cells after 15 min of stimulation by glucose (40Persaud S. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. Jones P. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) may be due to a difference in the sensitivity of the methods; the persistence of a low activity for at least 5 h was detected only with the anti-active ERK antibody. When the entry of calcium into the cells was blocked, either by incubation of the cells in the absence of calcium or by blocking the L-type calcium channels with nifedipine, the stimulation of the ERKs was abolished, indicating that calcium entry is a necessary component of this effect. The ERKs are also activated by glibenclamide, which, similarly to glucose, induces the entry of calcium into the cells by blocking the KATP channels, thus depolarizing the membrane. The calcium component of the response of the MIN6 cells to glucose appears therefore sufficient to activate the ERKs. Furthermore, the magnitude of the activation of the ERKs was correlated with the extent of the calcium entry. For instance, potassium, which induces a higher rise in cytoplasmic calcium than either glucose or kainate (41Matsumoto K. Fukunaga K. Miyazaki J.I. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3784-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), induced a higher activation of the ERKs. In addition, the concentration of kainate (0.5–1 mm) required to obtain a maximal activation of the ERKs was identical to the concentration that induced the maximal calcium entry into the cells (32Gonoi T. Mizuno N. Inagaki N. Kuromi H. Seino Y. Miyazaki J. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16989-16992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the magnitude of the activation of the ERKs was found to be clearly correlated with the extent of calcium entry, it decreased 15 min after the addition of glucose, despite the fact that glucose induces a sustained entry of calcium in the MIN6 cells (41Matsumoto K. Fukunaga K. Miyazaki J.I. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3784-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It appears that an inhibitory mechanism, which is independent of the decrease of calcium entry, regulates the activity of the ERKs. The level of the activation of the ERKs by stimulating the cells with both glucose and kainate showed some variability. This may be due to the fact that the calcium entry that takes place in response to this costimulation is itself variable. Analysis of the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium may help to elucidate this point. Kainate was shown to be neurotoxic in the central nervous system by injection into the cerebral ventricles (42Nadler J.V. Perry B.W. Cotman C.W. Nature. 1977; 271: 676-677Crossref Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 43Wheal H.V. Simpson L. Phelps S. Stockley E. Excitatory Amino Acids and Synaptic Function. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1991Google Scholar). It specifies a subtype of the glutamate receptors, but its physiological counterpart is unknown. In the MIN6 cells, it stimulates the secretion of insulin (32Gonoi T. Mizuno N. Inagaki N. Kuromi H. Seino Y. Miyazaki J. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16989-16992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the finding that kainate by itself induced a transient activation of the ERKs, and enhanced the activation in response to glucose, suggests that the kainate receptor may regulate the activity of the β cell in coordination with glucose. In fact, such a role was recently suggested for the kainate receptor in the pancreas; in an isolated rat pancreas, kainate stimulates the secretion of glucagon when the pancreas is perfused with 2.8 mmglucose (44Bertrand G. Gross R. Puech R. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Bockaert J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 237: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but it switches to the secretion of insulin when the concentration of glucose is raised to 8.3 mm. This concentration is slightly stimulatory by itself (45Bertrand G. Gross R. Puech R. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Bockaert J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of the kainate receptor may be to enhance the response of the pancreas to glucose, its main stimulus. Both glucose and potassium trigger the entry of calcium into the cell, activate the ERKs and induce the secretion of insulin. Forskolin by itself has little effect on the activity of the ERKs, but in the presence of glucose, it can bring about a quasi-maximal activation of the ERKs for up to 3.5 h. Such an effect does not occur with potassium. In contrast to glucose, the entry of calcium triggered by potassium is not mediated by the binding of ATP to the KATPchannels. If the entry of calcium triggered either by glucose or potassium activates the ERKs by the same pathway, then the components mediating the enhancement of the activation of the ERKs by forskolin may be the KATP channels themselves, possibly by phosphorylation. Finally, it is interesting to relate the absence of activation of the ERKs by forskolin alone and its ability to enhance the effect of glucose to the fact that the triggering of the insulin secretion by cAMP-dependent hormones such as GLP-I also depends on the presence of a stimulatory concentration of glucose (1Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 388-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This regulation by forskolin may be physiologically significant because cAMP may have a part in maintaining the transactivation potential of target transcription factors. The kinetics of the activation of the ERKs suggested their direct involvement in the regulation of the insulin secretory process. However, the present work demonstrates that the MEK inhibitor (PD 098059) was unable to inhibit the insulin secretion after addition of glucose, either after 15 min (data not shown) or 1 h (Fig. 7), whereas it could efficiently block the activation of the ERKs. Similar results were described recently in the INS-1 cells (46Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These observations are in agreement with the fact that nerve growth factor, which stimulated the ERKs in INS-1 cells (35Frödin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7882-7889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), does not induce insulin secretion and with the fact that inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases that stimulate the ERKs are also unable to induce insulin secretion (40Persaud S. Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. Jones P. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of insulin secretion appears to be independent of the activation of the ERKs. The long term regulation of insulin production at the transcriptional level is a more likely target of the activated ERKs. In this work, we demonstrate the occurrence of a nuclear translocation of the ERKs in the MIN6 cells, which is maximal after 5 min of stimulation with glucose. This is consistent with the rapid activation of the ERKs. It is important to note that, as opposed to what was reported in other systems (47Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar), a sustained activation of the ERKs is not required for a nuclear translocation. Furthermore, inasmuch as a potassium-induced depolarization is able to trigger this translocation, it is clear that the entry of calcium into the cells is by itself sufficient to induce a fast nuclear translocation of the ERKs. Altogether, the results presented above suggest that the ERKs are important intermediates in the regulation of the pancreatic β cell activity by calcium-dependent mechanisms. The secretory process itself, however, appears to be independent of the activation of the ERKs. The rapid translocation of the ERKs into the nucleus suggests their involvement in a transcriptional regulation. Such involvement was recently shown in the MIN6 cells for another MAP kinase, p38, which mediates stress responses, and was found to regulate the insulin gene expression in response to glucose (48Macfarlane W.M. Smith S.B. James R.F.L. Clifton A.D. Doza Y.N. Cohen P. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20936-20944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that, in contrast to the primary islet cells, in the INS-1 cells (49Olson L.K. Qian J. Poitout V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) the transcriptional activity of the insulin gene was diminished in response to high concentrations of glucose. Because the regulation of insulin secretion was almost identical in the primary islet cells and in the MIN6 cells, they may provide a valuable tool to study the transduction pathways involved in the transcriptional response of the insulin gene to glucose. We thank Vincent Poitout and Maya Megarbane for help with the insulin secretion determination and Isabelle Bouchaert for help with confocal microscopy. We are indebted to Andrés Alcover, Edmond Dupont, Mathilde Fagard, and Isabelle Sansal for critical reading of the manuscript."

TLS-CHOP was extremely effective at blocking adipocyte differentiation when expressed at a level comparable to that observed in human myxoid liposarcoma. This effect of TLS-CHOP required a functional leucine zipper domain and correlated with its ability to heterodimerize with C/EBPβ and inhibit C/EBPβ DNA binding and transactivation activityin situ.

Moreover, they provide strong support for the thesis that a blockade to normal differentiation is an important aspect of the cancer process. Adipogenesis is a process in which an undifferentiated mesenchymal cell capable of proliferation matures into a post mitotic, fat-laden adipocyte. This differentiation process results in dramatic changes in gene expression and a spectacular alteration in cell morphology. The early phase of adipocyte differentiation is accompanied by the induction of transcription factors that promote cell cycle withdrawal and activation of cell-specific genes, two key aspects of terminal cell differentiation.

C/EBPα was the first regulatory protein demonstrated to play a central role in promotion of the adipogenic program. We (1Freytag S. Geddes T.

Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) demonstrated that C/EBPα was both necessary and sufficient to promote adipogenesis in fibroblastic cells such as NIH3T3 and 3T3-L1. These observations, coupled with the fact that mice deficient in C/EBPα completely lack mature white or brown adipose tissue (7Wang N. Finegold M. Bradley A. Ou C. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Taylor L. Wilson D. Darlington G. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), demonstrate unequivocally the pivotal role of this transcription factor in adipogenesis. Following the same approach, several other transcription factors, including another member of the C/EBP family, C/EBPβ (8Yeh W. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 9Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N. Farmer S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), and PPARγ2, a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar,11Forman B. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R. Spiegelman B. Evans R. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar), proved capable of converting NIH3T3 cells into morphologically and biochemically differentiated adipocytes. It is now clear that all of the aforementioned transcription factors play an important and sequential role in the adipocyte differentiation process. In the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte model, induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are the earliest events to occur upon treatment with differentiation inducers (8Yeh W. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). These factors, in conjunction with adipogenic hormones, induce the expression of PPARγ2 (9Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N. Farmer S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The next event, which coincides with cell cycle withdrawal and commitment to the adipocyte differentiation program, is the induction of C/EBPα. The presence of C/EBP and PPAR binding sites in the C/EBPα promoter suggest that its expression may be regulated by C/EBPβ and PPARγ2 (12Christy R. Kaestner K. Geiman D. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2593-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In addition to transcription factors that induce and maintain the mature adipocyte phenotype, there are also factors that negatively regulate adipogenesis. Interestingly, one of these negative regulators, CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), a stress and DNA damage-induced transcription factor, is a member of the C/EBP family (13Ron D. Habener J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 14Fornace Jr., A.J. Neibert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fragoli J. Holbrook N. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Unlike other C/EBPs that can bind sequence-specific DNA as homodimers, CHOP homodimers cannot bind sequence-specific DNA due to a nonconsensual sequence in its basic region. However, CHOP is able to bind weakly to a restricted subset of high affinity C/EBP binding sites (GCAAT) when complexed as a heterodimer with other C/EBP proteins, such as C/EBPβ (16Ubeda M. Wang X. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although CHOP participates in the stress signal in response to metabolic injuries, its downstream effectors are yet to be described. Interestingly, an oncogenic variant of CHOP, called TLS-CHOP (TLS,translocation liposarcoma), is found specifically in myxoid liposarcoma, a malignant tumor of adipose tissue. TLS-CHOP results from a t(12;16) chromosomal translocation that fuses the amino-terminal part of TLS to the entire coding sequence of CHOP (17Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 18Rabbitts T. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Recently, a second chromosomal translocation (EWS-CHOP,Ewings sarcoma) specific for myxoid liposarcoma was also found to involve CHOP (19Panagopoulos I. Hoglund M. Mertens F. Mandahl N. Mittelman F. Aman P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 489-494PubMed Google Scholar). That two fusion oncoproteins involving CHOP are consistently (in over 90% of cases) and specifically associated with myxoid liposarcoma raises the possibility they are perturbing C/EBP function and causing a blockade in adipocyte differentiation. Although a previous study demonstrated that induction of endogenous CHOP by glucose deprivation inhibited 3T3-L1 adipogenesis (20Batchvarova N. Wang X. Ron D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4654-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. CHOP-expressing cells failed to induce normal levels of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, two factors which are required to drive the 3T3-L1 adipogenic program. Thus, it is not possible to discern from that study whether the failure of CHOP-expressing cells to differentiate was attributable to inhibition of C/EBP function by CHOP or a lack of required C/EBPα and C/EBPβ expression. Moreover, the effect of TLS-CHOP, the oncogenic form of CHOP, on adipocyte differentiation remains unexplored. In the present study we investigate whether TLS-CHOP can inhibit C/EBPβ-driven adipogenesis. Three lines of evidence make C/EBPβ the likely molecular target of TLS-CHOP in myxoid liposarcoma; (i) C/EBPβ protein is expressed in myxoid liposarcoma cells whereas C/EBPα is not (17Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) 2G. Adelmant, J. D. Gilbert, and S. O. Freytag, unpublished observations. 2G. Adelmant, J. D. Gilbert, and S. O. Freytag, unpublished observations.; (ii) C/EBPβ is induced early in the adipogenic pathway and is likely to trigger many of the downstream events (8Yeh W. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 9Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N. Farmer S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar); and (iii) C/EBPβ is the preferred heterodimerizing partner of TLS-CHOP (13Ron D. Habener J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that TLS-CHOP completely blocks C/EBPβ-driven adipogenesis by directly interfering with the normal function of the C/EBPβ protein. The results support the thesis that a blockade to normal differentiation is important in the development of the cancer phenotype. The parental vector, pLN(φ-φ), was derived from pLXSN (21Miller A.D. Rosman G. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). The encephalomyocarditis virus IRES sequence from pWZLneo (2Freytag S. Paielli D. Gilbert J.

The mouse C/EBPβ coding sequence was amplified by PCR from pMEX-CRP2 (22Williams S. Cantwell C. Johnson P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and cloned into the EcoRI restriction site of pLN(φ-φ) to generate pLN(C/EBPβ-φ). pLN(C/EBPβ-CHOP) and pLN(C/EBPβ-TLS-CHOP) were constructed by insertion of PCR-amplified human CHOP- and TLS-CHOP-coding sequences into the BamHI site of pLN(C/EBPβ-φ), respectively. Human TLS-CHOP-coding sequences were obtained by PCR amplification of a 402/91 myxoid liposarcoma (17Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) (obtained from P. Aman) λZAP (Stratagene) cDNA library. The two TLS-CHOP mutant versions were engineered by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Mutated regions were verified by DNA sequencing. TLS-CHOP/BR was found to carry a Glu to Gly mutation at amino acid 386. To generate pWZLhygroPPARγ2, the mouse PPARγ2-coding sequence was PCR-amplified from pBluescript-PPARγ2 (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar) (obtained from B. Spiegelman) and blunt end-ligated into pWZLhygro between the BamHI and EcoRI sites. pWZLhygro is identical to pWZLneo (2Freytag S. Paielli D. Gilbert J. Genes Dev. 1994; 14: 1654-1663Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar) except that it contains the hygromycin resistance gene in place of the neomycin resistance gene. p(aP2)3TATA-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was created by cloning the double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-AGCTTTTTCTCAACTTTGGAGCTCTTTTCTCAACTTTGGGTACCTTTTCTCAACTTTGG-3′ into HindIII/BamHI-digested TATA-CAT (23Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retroviruses were produced by transient transfection of the Bosc 23 ecotropic packaging cell line (24Pear W. Nolan G. Scott M. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8296-8392Crossref Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106, 60-mm diameter dish) were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using 10 μg of plasmid DNA. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h later and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter syringe. NIH3T3 cells (ATCC) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (growth medium). NIH3T3 cells (3 × 105, 60-mm diameter dish) were infected with a similar titer of the different retroviruses 1 day after plating. Viruses were left in contact with the cells for 6 h in growth medium containing 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Two days later, infected cells were detached by trypsinization and seeded into four dishes (100-mm diameter) containing growth medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After selection for 1 week, G418-resistant cells were pooled and subcultured for subsequent experiments. NIH3T3 pools infected with WZLhygro and WZLhygroPPARγ2 were treated in exactly the same manner except cells were selected in growth medium containing 400 μg/ml hygromycin B for 7 days. To test for differentiation ability, each pool was seeded at 3 × 105 cells/dish (60-mm diameter) and treated 3 days later (confluence) with differentiation medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, and 10 μg/ml insulin. After 48 h of treatment, the medium was changed and cells were maintained thereafter in the same medium but containing only insulin. Seven days later, cells were either fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with Oil Red O or processed for whole cell protein analysis. NIH3T3 pools expressing PPARγ2 were induced to differentiate with 5 μm pioglitazone as described previously (11Forman B. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R. Spiegelman B. Evans R. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). To test for C/EBPβ transactivation, each cell pool (3 × 105, 60-mm diameter dish) was co-transfected with 2.5 μg of a CAT reporter gene and 0.5 μg of pCMV luciferase using lipofection (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and equal amounts of transfection efficiency-corrected cell extracts were assayed for CAT activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared from actively dividing cell cultures. Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 6.6 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 15 min incubation on ice, the suspension was homogenized, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The crude nuclei were washed in 500 μl of the same buffer, collected by microcentrifugation, lysed in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. The same protocol was used to prepare nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 and 402/91 cells. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis, and specific proteins were detected by Western blotting using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). For co-immunoprecipitation studies, nuclei were prepared as described above except the nuclear proteins were extracted from crude nuclei in high salt buffer [20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100] for 30 min on ice. The NaCl concentration was adjusted to 150 mm with the same buffer lacking NaCl, and proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at room temperature with 5 μl of anti C/EBPβ (D298, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Pellets were washed sequentially with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS containing 500 mm NaCl, and PBS. Immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer and processed for Western analysis as described above. Cells (105) were plated on glass chamber slides and allowed to grow to confluence. Cells were either left untreated or treated with differentiation inducers as described above. Cells were fixed in 3.7% (v/v) formalin, permeabilized with methanol, and incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-PPARγ2 antibody (PA3-821, Affinity Bioreagents Inc.) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (both 1:200 dilution in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were examined and photographed using an Olympus BX40 fluorescent microscope. Nuclear extracts were prepared exactly as described elsewhere (25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts prepared from the different pools were first analyzed by Western blotting to normalize for LAP expression. Twenty micrograms (20 μg) of nuclear extract were incubated in C/EBP DNA binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmKCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 25 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar) on ice for 30 min in the presence of either 100 ng of unlabeled competitor DNA, 100 ng of anti-C/EBPβ (C19, Santa Cruz) or anti-CHOP antibody (R20, Santa Cruz) prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled DNA probes. Nucleoprotein complexes were resolved in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel prepared in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA. The following32P-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as probes in DNA-binding reactions: aP2, 5′-agcttgTTTCTCAACTTTGa-3′; SAAB4, 5′-agcttgAAATGCAATCGCCa-3′. To determine whether TLS-CHOP could inhibit C/EBPβ function in adipogenesis, we developed a system where both the inducer of differentiation (C/EBPβ) and the potential inhibitor (TLS-CHOP) could be co-expressed simultaneously in naive NIH3T3 cells. This was accomplished through the use of triple gene retroviral vectors in which the C/EBPβ and TLS-CHOP proteins are produced from the same bicistronic mRNA driven by the proviral long terminal repeat, and expression of the selectable marker gene (neo) is driven by an internal (SV40) promoter (Fig. 1). This approach has several conceptual and technical advantages: (i) unlike the 3T3-L1 system, the differentiation of NIH3T3 cells is completely dependent on the introduction of an exogenous transcription factor(s) making it possible to express the factor constitutively, (ii) use of the triple gene vectors eliminates the need to perform sequential infections and selections thereby avoiding the generation of clonal cell lines which vary widely in their ability to differentiate, and (iii) co-translation of the C/EBPβ and TLS-CHOP proteins from the same bicistronic mRNA greatly increases the likelihood that they will be expressed stoichiometrically within the same cell. To obtain insight into which structural domains of TLS-CHOP are required for its inhibitory effect, two mutants were generated. TLS-CHOP/BR contains three site-directed mutations in its basic region (Arg407 → Gly, Lys410 → Gly, Arg412 → Asn). These three basic amino acids were selected for mutagenesis because they were previously shown to be critical for C/EBPα DNA binding activity (26Landschulz W. Johnson P. McKnight S. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). TLS-CHOP/LZ contains five Leu to Gly conversions in the leucine zipper (positions 427, 434, 441, 452, and 459) and was constructed to investigate the requirement of the heterodimerization domain. A retroviral vector encoding the normal CHOP protein was also generated to serve as a positive control. All six vectors were introduced into naive NIH3T3 cells by retroviral infection and pooled cell lines representing several thousand G418-resistant clones were generated following a brief selection in G418. Cell pools were examined for protein expression and their ability to undergo adipogenesis. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the five cell pools infected with the vectors encoding C/EBPβ either alone or in conjunction with CHOP, TLS-CHOP, and the TLS-CHOP mutants, express the same amount of the 36-kDa C/EBPβ (LAP) protein (lanes 2–6). This amount is significantly higher than the endogenous level of C/EBPβ found in NIH3T3 cells infected with the control vector (lane 1). Importantly, the level of C/EBPβ protein expressed in the NIH3T3 pools (lanes 2–6) is identical to that observed in 3T3-L1 adipoblasts on day 2 of differentiation (lane 8), whereas its level of expression in cells infected with the control vector (lane 1) is similar to that of undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells (lane 7). Similarly, the level of CHOP expression in cells stably infected with the C/EBPβ-CHOP retrovirus (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) is comparable to that observed in 3T3-L1 cells grown in low glucose for 2 days (lane 8). Likewise, TLS-CHOP and its two mutants are expressed at a roughly equal level (lanes 4–6), which is slightly greater than that observed in the 402/91 myxoid liposarcoma cell line (lane 9). These results demonstrate that in this model system, the expression of C/EBPβ, CHOP, and TLS-CHOP closely mimics the normal or pathological conditions occurring in adipose tissue. NIH3T3 cells expressing exogenous C/EBPβ can be induced to differentiate in a manner very similar to 3T3-L1 cells (8Yeh W. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 9Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N. Farmer S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). To determine the adipogenic potential of the various cell pools, confluent cell monolayers were treated with adipogenic hormones for two days and the extent of differentiation was scored at day ten. As expected, the differentiation of NIH3T3 cells was completely dependent on ectopic expression of C/EBPβ (Fig. 3 A, top, compare φ-φ to C/EBPβ-φ). Under these conditions, C/EBPβ was able to convert essentially 100% of the cell monolayer into mature, fat-laden adipocytes. Co-expression of CHOP (C/EBPβ-CHOP) strongly inhibited C/EBPβ-driven adipogenesis as only a low percentage of the cells acquired small fat droplets. Similarly, TLS-CHOP abolished C/EBPβ-driven adipogenesis and proved to be slightly, but consistently, better than CHOP. The extent of differentiation of TLS-CHOPexpressing cells (C/EBPβ-TLS-CHOP) was essentially identical to that of cells infected with the parental vector (φ-φ). Importantly, this inhibitory effect of TLS-CHOP was not attributable to its transforming activity as only a minute percentage (≪1%) of cells co-expressing C/EBPβ and TLS-CHOP showed signs of morphological transformation (fusiform morphology or foci formation). On the contrary, the vast majority of these cells displayed a morphology which was indistinguishable from that of control cells. Surprisingly, the TLS-CHOP basic region mutant (C/EBPβ-TLS-CHOP/BR) blocked adipogenic conversion by C/EBPβ as effectively as CHOP. By contrast, TLS-CHOP bearing point mutations in its heterodimerizing domain (C/EBPβ-TLS-CHOP/LZ) had no effect on C/EBPβ-driven differentiation. These morphological observations were corroborated by examining the expression of aP2, a late differentiation marker. As shown in Fig. 3 B (bottom), expression of aP2 was strongly induced upon differentiation of the C/EBPβ-φ and C/EBPβ-TLS-CHOP/LZ cell pools. In contrast, there was little or no induction of aP2 in those pools that failed to differentiate morphologically. Importantly, the failure of the CHOP-, TLS-CHOP-, and TLS-CHOP/BR-expressing cell pools to differentiate can not be attributed to reduced expression of the transcription factor driving the adipogenic program as C/EBPβ was expressed equally among these cell pools (see Fig. 2 A). Because the leucine zipper domain of TLS-CHOP was required for its ability to inhibit C/EBPβ-driven adipogenesis, we examined whether this effect of TLS-CHOP correlated with its ability to heterodimerize with C/EBPβ in situ. Both TLS-CHOP (Fig. 4, lane 4) and its basic region mutant (lane 5) could be co-immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts with C/EBPβ-specific antibodies, indicating that these proteins were stably complexed with C/EBPβ. As expected, mutation of the leucine zipper domain of TLS-CHOP (lane 6) abolished its ability to heterodimerize with C/EBPβ. Thus, the ability of TLS-CHOP to inhibit C/EBPβ-driven adipogenesis requires its leucine zipper domain and correlates with its ability to form a stable heterodimer with C/EBPβ in situ. The data presented thus far are consistent with a mechanism in which TLS-CHOP inhibits C/EBP-driven adipogenesis by directly interfering with C/EBPβ function. However, they do not rule out the possibility that TLS-CHOP may block other requisite events which are independent of C/EBPβ function. To address this possibility, we examined whether ectopic expression of PPARγ2, another adipogenic transcription factor (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar, 11Forman B. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R. Spiegelman B. Evans R. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar), could rescue TLS-CHOP-inhibited cells from their differentiation block. NIH3T3 pools expressing φ-φ and C/EBPβ-TLS-CHOP were infected with a control retrovirus (WZLhygro) or one encoding PPARγ2 (WZLhygroPPARγ2). Following a brief selection in hygromycin B, cells were pooled and examined for expression of PPARγ2 and their ability to differentiate into adipocytes. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that ∼80% of cells infected with WZLhygro PPARγ2 expressed PPARγ2 in the nucleus (not shown). By contrast, cells infected with the control virus and uninfected C/EBPβ-TLS-CHOP cells (see Fig. 8, below right) did not express PPARγ2. Results of the differentiation assays demonstrated clearly that PPARγ2 was able to rescue TLS-CHOP-inhibited cells from their differentiation block (Fig. 5). Indeed, following treatment with the PPARγ2 activator pioglitazone (11Forman B. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R. Spiegelman B. Evans R. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar), C/EBPβ-TLS-CHOP cells expressing PPARγ2 differentiated as well as PPARγ2-expressing control (φ-φ) cells. The results demonstrate that TLS-CHOP-inhibited cells are capable of adipogenesis, suggesting that TLS-CHOP does not interfere with other requisite C/EBPβ-independent events.Figure 5PPARγ2 can rescue TLS-CHOP-inhibited NIH3T3 cells. φ-φ and C/EBPβ-TLS-CHOP cell pools infected with the parental WZLhygro retroviral vector (no PPARγ2) or WZLhygroPPARγ2 (PPARγ2) were examined for their ability to differentiate in the presence of 5 μm pioglitazone. Cell monolayers were fixed and stained with Oil Red O 8 days later. Differentiation assays were repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To gain a better understanding of how TLS-CHOP inhibits"

Expression of the gene is enhanced by the T cell growth factor interleukin-2, suggesting a role for HePTP in T cell proliferation or differentiation. We report that HePTP blocks T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-induced transcriptional activation of a reporter gene driven by a nuclear factor of activated T cells(NFAT)/AP-1 element taken from the interleukin-2 gene promoter. This effect was specific to HePTP and was abolished by a mutation (C270S) that impaired its phosphatase activity. Co-expression of HePTP also reduced TCR-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk2 and the TCR-induced appearance of phosphorylated Erk. In contrast, HePTP did not affect the activation of the N-terminal c-Jun kinase, Jnk. Together these findings suggest that HePTP plays an active negative role in TCR signaling by dephosphorylating one or several signaling molecules between the receptor and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

The hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) was originally cloned from human T lymphocytes (12Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M. Pawson A. Mak T.W. Eur. J.

Commun. 1992; 186: 1607-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The gene is expressed in thymus and at lower levels in spleen, but not in nonhematopoietic tissues. The exon/intron structure of the HePTP gene (15Adaichi M. Miyachi T. Sekiya M. Hinoda Y. Yachi A. Imai K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3031-3035PubMed Google Scholar) is quite similar to that of the phosphatase domains of human CD45. In contrast to CD45, however, the 38-kDa HePTP consists of only a single PTPase domain, which occupies the C-terminal three-fourths of the enzyme and is preceded by a ∼70-amino acid noncatalytic N terminus. Presently, very little is known about the physiological function of HePTP, but some indications may be derived from the findings that its gene maps to chromosome 1q32.1 (13Zanke B. Squire J. Greisser H. Henry M. Suzuki H. Patterson B. Minden M. Mak T.W. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 236-244PubMed Google Scholar), which is a site for frequent chromosomal abnormalities in preleukemic myeloproliferative disease (16Fonatsch C. Haase D. Freund M. Bartels H.

Cytogenet. 1988; 35: 21-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and that gene amplification and overexpression of HePTP have been reported for leukemic cells (13Zanke B. Squire J. Greisser H. Henry M. Suzuki H. Patterson B. Minden M. Mak T.W. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 236-244PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, expression of HePTP in NIH3T3 cells resulted in altered cell morphology and decreased contact inhibition (13Zanke B. Squire J. Greisser H. Henry M. Suzuki H. Patterson B. Minden M. Mak T.W. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 236-244PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest a role for HePTP in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, or differentiation. This possibility is supported by the up-regulation of HePTP mRNA in T cells in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2) (18Adaichi M. Sekiya M. Ishino M. Sasaki H. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Yachi A FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and by the rapid phosphorylation of HePTP on tyrosine in RBL-2H3 mast cells stimulated through their FcεRI (19Swieter M. Berenstein E.H. Swaim W.D. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21902-21906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since HePTP is preferentially expressed in T cells and may be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, we decided to investigate the involvement of this enzyme in TCR-induced T cell activation. We report that HePTP had a strong inhibitory effect on the transcriptional activation of a reporter gene driven by three tandem nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)/AP-1 elements derived from the 5′ IL-2 gene promotor, while a catalytically inactive C270S mutant HePTP did not. HePTP also reduced TCR-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk2, but not of the N-terminal c-Jun kinase (Jnk). Based on these findings we suggest that HePTP plays a negative role in TCR signaling by acting on signaling molecules upstream of MAPK and transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene.

Veillette) in pMX139. The c-Myc-tagged Erk2 (from C. Marshall) was in pEF-neo. The NFAT/AP-1-luc construct (from G. Crabtree) contains three tandem NFAT/AP-1 sites driving the expression of a luciferase gene. To generate a catalytically inactive mutant of HePTP, the codon for Cys-270 was changed into a codon for serine in the pEF/HA-HePTP plasmid using the transformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). The resulting C270S mutation was verified by sequencing. The C216S mutant of TCPTP was generated and verified by the same procedure. Jurkat T leukemia cells and two variants of this cell line: J-TAg (from Dr. M. Karin), which is stably transfected with simian virus 40 large T antigen, and JCaM1.6 (from Dr. A. Weiss), which lacks Lck (23Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. These cells were transiently transfected with a total of 5–10 μg of DNA by electroporation at 950 microfarads and 240 V. Empty vector was added to control samples to make a constant amount of DNA in each sample. Cells were used for experiments 48 h after transfection. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were transfected by lipofection with a total of 5–10 μg of DNA and grown for 48 h prior to the experiments. These assays were performed as described previously (24Jascur T. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14483-14488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of NFAT/AP-1-luc together with empty vector or PTK and/or PTPase plasmids. Two days later, the cells were either stimulated with the anti-CD3ε mAb OKT3 (5 or 10 μg/ml) or left untreated. After 8 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 5 min. The final assay contained 50 μl of lysate plus 100 μl of ATP solution (10 mm ATP in 35 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 20 mmMgCl2) plus 100 μl of luciferin reagent (0.27 mm coenzyme A, 0.47 mm luciferin, 35 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 20 mmMgCl2). The activity was measured in an automatic luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). The total protein concentration in each cell lysate was determined by the Bradford protein assay and was used to normalize the luciferase activity. Typically, the variation in protein concentration between samples was less than 20%. Cells were lysed in 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The clarified lysates were preabsorbed on protein G-Sepharose and then incubated with antibody for 2 h, followed by protein G-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, once in lysis buffer with 0.5 m NaCl, again in lysis buffer, and either suspended in SDS sample buffer or used forin vitro kinase assays. These were performed as described previously (20von Willebrand M. Jascur T. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Yano H. Altman A. Matsuda Y. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 828-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Couture C. Songyang Z. Jascur T. Williams S. Tailor P. Cantley L.C. Mustelin T. J. Biol.

Briefly, 20 × 106 JCaM1 cells were transfected with 5 μg of c-Myc-tagged Erk2 plasmid, 1 μg of HePTP plasmid, and 5 μg of Lck plasmid. Empty vector was added to control samples to make constant amount of DNA in each sample. Cells were harvested 2 days after electroporation, divided into two samples/transfection, and either stimulated with OKT3 (5 μg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C or left untreated. Cells were lysed as described above and the Myc-tagged Erk2 immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of the 9E10 anti-Myc mAb followed by 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads. The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 μg of myelin basic protein, 1 μm ATP,and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were terminated by adding 20 μl 2 × SDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 2 min. The samples were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, and the labeled proteins visualized by autoradiography. The presence of equal amounts of the immunoprecipitated Erk2 was verified by Western blotting using the anti-Erk2 antibody at 1:1000 dilution, anti-mouse-Ig-peroxidase, and the blots developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The catalytic activity of immunoprecipitated HePTP from Jurkat T cells was measured as described earlier (11Tailor P. Gilman J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The reaction was for 30 min at 37 °C in 100 μl of 50 mmsodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, with 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. The production of p-nitrophenol was measured as absorbance at 410 nm. The coding region of HePTP was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction technique using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to both ends of the open reading frame and with human HePTP (clone HEPTP2761 PBSSKM from B. Zanke) as the template. The 1019-base pair amplification product was cloned into the pEF-HA vector and sequenced. The obtained nucleotide sequence was 100% identical to the published sequence (12Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M. Pawson A. Mak T.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Transient expression of the pEF/HA-HePTP construct in COS or J-TAg cells resulted in the appearance of a ∼40-kDa (the tag adds ∼2 kDa) protein that was both immunoblotted and immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA tag mAbs 12CA5 and 16B12. The expression plasmid was also well expressed in Jurkat, JCaM1, and particularly well in J-TAg cells. Very similar expression levels were seen with the catalytically inactive C270S mutant of HePTP. Fig. 1 d shows a PTPase assay of anti-tag immunoprecipitates obtained from 20 × 106J-TAg cells transfected with empty pEF/HA vector or the HePTP constructs or another PTPase TCPTP and its inactive (C216S) mutant. As expected, the wild-type enzymes had easily measurable catalytic activity, while the two mutants did not. The amounts of wild-type and mutated proteins were similar (Fig. 1 d,inset). The full-length open reading frame of human HePTP was also subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-2T (with a glycine kinker), and the recombinant fusion protein was expressed, purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography, cleaved by thrombin, purified, and used for immunization of two rabbits. The resulting antisera were highly reactive against a 38-kDa endogenous protein in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1 a) and a 40-kDa protein in T cells or COS cells transfected with the pEF/HA-HePTP construct (Fig. 1, b andc). The polyclonal anti-HePTP antiserum also precipitated enzymatically active HePTP from 20 × 106 Jurkat T cells: the colorimetric assays gave an A at 410 nm of 0.256 and 0.277 (duplicate determinations) compared with preimmune serum precipitates giving 0.009 and 0.011. The corresponding values for 20 × 106 JCaM1 cells were 0.423 and 0.369versus 0.008 and 0.011. Activation of T cells through the TCR plus accessory molecules leads to the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene, followed by production and secretion of IL-2. Subsequently, this lymphokine binds to specific high-affinity receptors present mainly on activated T cells and drives the cells through the cell cycle, resulting in the clonal proliferation of T cells. TCR-induced activation of the IL-2 gene is conveniently measured by transfecting T cells with a luciferase reporter construct driven by elements from the IL-2 gene 5′ promoter. First, we transfected J-TAg cells with the NFAT/AP-1-luc reporter together with HePTP or empty pEF/HA vector. Two days after transfection the cells were treated with OKT3 for 6 h, lysed, and the activity of the induced luciferase measured. As can be seen in the upper panel of Fig. 2., co-expression of HePTP strongly reduced the capacity of the TCR/CD3 to activate NFAT/AP-1. This result was obtained in three independent experiments (duplicate determinations in each). However, due to the SV40 large T antigen, these cells express high levels of transiently transfected constructs, making the system potentially prone to artifacts. Therefore, we next used JCaM1 cells, in which pEF-based constructs are expressed at levels close to the endogenous amounts of signaling proteins (25Williams S. Couture C. Gilman J. Jascur T. Deckert M. Altman A. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These cells also lack endogenous Lck (23Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) and have very low levels of Syk (26Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Laverty M. Kut S.A. von Oers N.S.C. Weiss A. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26533-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and do not respond to anti-CD3 mAbs unless either kinase is re-expressed. First, we transfected these cells with Lck alone or in combination with wild-type HePTP or catalytically inactive HePTP-C270S together with the NFAT/AP-1-luc reporter. Two days after transfection the cells were treated with OKT3 for 8 h, lysed, and the luciferase activity measured. As shown in thelower panel of Fig. 2., expression of Lck restored the capacity of the TCR/CD3 to activate NFAT/AP-1. In comparison, co-transfection of active HePTP reduced the activation of the reporter construct to less than 10%, while the C270S mutant did not have any significant effect. This result was obtained in four independent experiments (duplicate determinations in each), and control blots showed that HePTP and Lck were similarly expressed in all cases (Fig. 2, lower panel inset). To determine whether the effect of HePTP was specific for the co-expression with Lck, we utilized our recent observation that expression of Syk in JCaM1 cells also enables the TCR to induce a normal activation of the NFAT/AP-1 reporter gene (25Williams S. Couture C. Gilman J. Jascur T. Deckert M. Altman A. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When HePTP was co-transfected with Syk and NFAT/AP-1-luc, there was a very substantial reduction in the NFAT activation induced by OKT3 compared with cells transfected with Syk and NFAT-luc alone. The average reduction from eight determinations was 83.5% with a total block in many experiments. In contrast, the catalytically inactive HePTP-C270S augmented the activation of the reporter somewhat, but this augmentation was variable and was not seen in all experiments. Therefore, we felt that it was important to compare these effects of wild-type and C270S-mutated HePTP with a number of other PTPases. As can be seen in Fig. 3, SHP1, TCPTP, PTP36, VHR, LMPTP (all in the same pEF vector), and the c-Cbl protooncogene all had a slight stimulatory effect on the OKT3-induced Syk-mediated NFAT/AP-1 activity. Thus, the strong inhibition by HePTP is unique to this PTPase. We also used a positive control in these experiments, namely Vav, which we have earlier shown to synergize with Syk in mediating TCR-induced NFAT/AP-1 activation (27Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Vav with Syk augmented the activation of the reporter construct about 20-fold. This suggests that the slight stimulatory effect of HePTP-C270S, the control PTPases, and c-Cbl are insignificant. Note that Syk is equally expressed in all samples and that the HA-tagged PTPases are all expressed at comparable levels, and most importantly that wild-type and C270S-mutated HePTP are present at equal amounts. As the IL-2 promoter activation experiments above suggest that HePTP may play a role in TCR-induced T cell activation somewhere between the TCR and the IL-2 gene, we next tested a more receptor-proximal read-out for TCR signaling, namely the activation of the MAPK pathway. JCaM1 cells were transiently co-transfected with a Myc-tagged Erk2 MAPK together with HePTP or HePTP-C270S. Two days after transfection, each sample was divided in half; one-half was left unstimulated while the other half was treated with anti-CD3 mAbs for 5 min at 37 °C. After cell lysis, the tagged Erk2 was immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 anti-c-Myc mAb, and after washing these precipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays with myelin basic protein as a substrate and the phosphorylation of the substrates was visualized by autoradiography. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the tagged Erk2 was not significantly activated in cells co-transfected with empty pEF/HA vector (lanes 1 and 2). Co-expression of Lck (lanes 3 and4) enabled the anti-CD3 mAb to cause severalfold activation of Erk2. Furthermore, HePTP had a significant inhibitory effect on MAPK activation whereas HePTP-C270S augmented the effect. The amount of Erk2 was found to be similar in all the samples (Fig. 4, middle panel), and HePTP and HePTP-C270S were equally expressed inlanes 5–8 (lower panel). The expression of Lck was also similar in lanes 3–8 (not shown). This result was obtained in several independent experiments. To further verify that the effect of HePTP on Erk2 truly reflects an inhibitory effect on the intracellular mechanism of MAPK activation rather than a direct effect in the kinase assays or some other artifactual event connected to the transfected Erk, we analyzed lysates from JCaM1 cells transfected with Lck with or without HePTP, HePTP-C270S, TCPTP, or TCPTP-C216S by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the phosphorylated and activated form of Erk. These blots (Fig. 5, upper panel) showed that phospho-Erk was only induced by OKT3 treatment in cells expressing Lck and that catalytically active HePTP reduced this induction. In contrast, the C270S mutant of HePTP, as well as the TCPTP constructs, did not. Control blots showed that all samples contained similar amounts of endogenous MAPK (second panel) and that HePTP and TCPTP were well and equally expressed (third panel), as was Lck (bottom panel). This result was obtained in three independent experiments. To further understand the negative effect of HePTP on NFAT/AP-1 activation, we decided to also study the effect of this PTPase on the Jnk kinase pathway, which is involved in the activation of c-Jun, a component of the AP-1 complex. Jurkat cells were transfected with empty vector, Jnk1 (in pEF/HA), alone or together with HePTP. Two days after transfection, samples were treated with OKT3 and anti-CD28 (mAb 9.3) plus sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody or with the secondary antibody alone. 20 min later, the cells were lysed and the HA-tagged Jnk1 immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 anti-HA mAb and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun as a substrate. These experiments consistently failed to reveal any effect of HePTP despite good activation of Jnk1 and good expression of both Jnk1 and the PTPase (not shown). We conclude that the substrate(s) for HePTP are involved in MAPK regulation, but not in Jnk activation. Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical mechanism for the regulation of signal transduction, cell growth, differentiation, and development. These processes involve the balanced action of both PTKs and PTPases, which also regulate each other in a complex manner. In T cells, the repertoire of PTKs involved in the earliest signaling events initiated by ligation of the TCR and its co-receptors is relatively well characterized. In contrast, the PTPases that regulate these PTKs and that counteract their phosphorylation of key signaling molecules are largely unknown. The transmembrane receptor-like PTPase CD45 was the first PTPase implied in T cell activation (3Mustelin T.

This enzyme dephosphorylates the C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine in the Src family PTKs Lck (6Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gahmberg C.G. Andersson L.C. Burn P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This function of CD45 is not induced by TCR triggering, but occurs in a constitutive manner and is critical for T cell for activation, presumably by maintaining a large fraction of Lck and Fyn in a potentially active state (3Mustelin T. Immunity. 1994; 1: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and by promoting a relatively high level of basal tyrosine phosphorylation of the activation motifs in the TCR-ζ and CD3 chains. Another PTPase, the SH2 domain-containing PTPase SHP1, has been implied as a negative regulator of signaling from the TCR as well as many other hematopoietic receptors. The evidence for its direct participation in TCR signaling, however, is not compelling, and it may be that SHP1 is mainly involved in signaling by inhibitory receptors, such as p58KIR, p70KIR, FcγRIIB, and CD22 (29Imboden J.B. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 727-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have previously added the second SH2 domain-containing PTPase, SHP2 (10Tailor P. Jascur T. Williams S. von Willebrand M. Couture C. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the low molecular weight PTPase, LMPTP-B (11Tailor P. Gilman J. Williams S. Couture C. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5371-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), to the list of PTPases that may participate in TCR signaling. SHP2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, while LMPTP-B is dephosphorylated upon TCR triggering, but there is currently no evidence for any functional role of these PTPases in T cell activation. Thus, the PTPases that dephosphorylate TCR-ζ, the activation sites in Lck (Y394) or Fyn (Y417), or the multiple phosphorylation sites in Zap and Syk, or the multitude of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in all the substrates for these PTKs, remain unknown. In this paper we show that another T cell-expressed PTPase, HePTP, has a strong negative effect in TCR-induced T cell activation. We show that expression of HePTP blocks the induction of NFAT/AP-1-driven transcription and the phosphorylation and activation of Erk. This effect of HePTP did not require gross overexpression of the enzyme and was unique to HePTP in comparison with several other PTPases (TCPTP, SHP1, PTP36, LMPTP, and VHR). The effect also required the catalytic activity of HePTP. In some experiments (e.g. Fig. 4), the catalytically inactive C270S mutant of HePTP even had a stimulatory effect, perhaps due to competition with endogenous HePTP. It is also worth noting that expression of HePTP did not detectably affect the overall profile of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation (not shown). Together, these experiments indicate that HePTP dephosphorylates relatively few components of the TCR signaling machinery, at least one of which is located upstream of the MAPK Erk2. In contrast, our experiments with TCPTP do not reveal any effects of this PTPase in TCR signaling. It is worth noting that HePTP blocked NFAT/AP-1 induction to a greater extent (80–100%) than it reduced MAPK activation (∼50%). This difference could be due to the dephosphorylation of additional signaling molecules by HePTP leading to inhibition of other parallel pathways required for NFAT/AP-1 activation. Alternatively, the reduction of MAPK activation seen at 5 min is sufficient to keep the machinery responsible for NFAT/AP-1 activation at 8 h after receptor triggering below a critical threshold. It is conceivable that HePTP also shortens the duration of the MAPK response. In conclusion, our results introduce HePTP as a potentially important negative regulator of T cell activation and indicate that at least one site of HePTP action is located between the TCR and the phosphorylation and activation of MAPKs. Further experiments will be needed to determine more precisely where in the signaling cascade that HePTP acts and to establish its exact role and importance in T cell activation.

Fazakerley G.V. Guschlbauer W. Kaplan B.E. Sowers L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 9Bjoras M. Luna L. Johnsen B. Hoff E. Haug T. Rognes T. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Also, it now appears that some polymerases may place all four bases opposite an abasic site and not only dA residues (10Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) leading to both apurinic and apyrimidinic sites. The structure of damaged DNA is sequence-dependent as is the structure of undamaged DNA, and the presence of an abasic site within a curved DNA sequence can have large, long range structural effects (11Wang K.Y. Parker S.A. Goljer I. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11629-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Results on the structures of repair enzymes have led to the suggestion that the abasic site can be recognized directly (12Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6548-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Damaged DNA plays roles in controlling the cell cycle, and these roles are of considerable and growing interest because of their importance in apoptosis and carcinogenesis as noted in recent reviews (13Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 14Edgar B.A. Lehner C.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15King R.W. Deshaies R.J.

It now appears that there are “checkpoints” for the presence of damaged DNA which need to be passed before a cell can go from G1 to G2 (18Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The processes by which these checkpoints control the G1 to G2 passage are not yet known. It is also not known how many types of damaged DNA are recognized at these checkpoints nor how many different procedures are used to recognize damaged DNA (19Cleaver J.E. States J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Cleaver J.E. Layher S.K. Cell. 1995; 80: 825-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Verdine G.L. Bruner S.D.

Normal cells with damaged DNA are programmed to undergo apoptosis, and apparently only cells with damaged DNA and which avoid this step can become transformed into tumor cells (2Freidberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 16Stillman B.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

In many cells the predominant pathway to the formation of aldehydic abasic sites is the spontaneous deamination of cytosine to uracil (5Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 6Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1997; 383: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Lindahl T. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 1988; 57: 29-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The enzyme N-uracil glycoslyase excises uracil to form an aldehydic abasic site as shown in SchemeFSI. For a typical Escherichia coli there are about 40–400 such events per cell division, and in a typical mammalian cell 4,000–40,000 uracil are formed per cell division (2Freidberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 35Frederico L.A. Kunkel T.A. Shaw B.R.

The number of damaged sites in a particular genome depends on the state of the cell, and some damaged sites may not be repaired until the G1 to G2 passage occurs. The number of abasic sites in a “typical” human cell is not known because the rates of damage and repair are dependent on many factors. Ames and co-workers (37Cathcart R. Schniers E. Saul R.L. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) have estimated that there are more than 10,000 damaged sites, of all types, per typical human cell at any given time. The presence of a direct relationship between DNA damage and cancer is known, but the number and types of damage to DNA which are required for transformation to occur are just now being determined. The cleavage of the glycosidic bonds is catalyzed by DNA glycosylases, which were first identified by Lindahl and Nyberg in 1974 (38Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and many distinct classes of glycosylases are now known (6Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1997; 383: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of two uracil glycosylases have been determined (39Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Alseth I.

The abasic site is not a chemically unique species but is an equilibrium mixture (44Manoharan M. Ransom S.C. Mazumder A. Gerlt J.A. Wilde J.A. Withka J.M. Bolton P.H. J. Am. Chem.

The 3′-cleavage of the abasic site catalyzed by AP lyases is via asyn β-elimination reaction (6Cunningham R.P. Mutat. Res. 1997; 383: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (SchemeFSII). Subsequent to the formation of the aldehydic abasic site the repair process can continue with the cleavage of both the 5′- and 3′-phosphodiester bonds. The 3′-cleavage reaction catalyzed by UV endonuclease V of bacteriophage T4 and by E. coliendonuclease III or the enzyme formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase is a β-elimination that proceeds with syn stereochemistry, with abstraction of the 2′-pro-S proton, as discussed elsewhere (44Manoharan M.

The 5′-cleavage is via a delta elimination when catalyzed by formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (40Savva R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). After the abasic site is cleaved at both the 3′- and 5′-phosphodiester linkages the site is repaired via synthesis and ligation of the DNA (7Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). There have been a number of investigations of the effects of unrepaired aldehydic abasic sites on replication. Studies on the effect of abasic sites on both in vivo and in vitro replication have been carried out on a variety of DNA polymerases (2Freidberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

Recent results indicate that DNA damage can affect DNA replication at sites remote from the site of damage (52Miller H. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15336-15342Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) indicative of interactions of the polymerases with the DNA at positions remote from the site of damage. The presence of an unrepaired aldehydic abasic site can lead to a stable mutation as well as having effects on transcription (2Freidberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar,53Sanchez G. Mamet-Bradley M.D. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1994; 23: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 54Sanchez G. Racine J.F. Mamet-Bratley M.D. Mutat. Res. 1994; 325: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The results to date suggest that the presence of an abasic site slows down but does not block transcription (53Sanchez G. Mamet-Bradley M.D. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1994; 23: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 54Sanchez G. Racine J.F. Mamet-Bratley M.D. Mutat. Res. 1994; 325: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 55Tessman I. Kennedy M.A. Genetics. 1994; 16: 439-448Google Scholar). The base most commonly placed at the position complementary to the abasic site in transcription is rA. This is the same preference as found for some, but not all, DNA polymerases (10Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

To determine the details of the structure of a DNA duplex containing an abasic site we have investigated the apyrimidinic duplex, d(C1d(G22G2C21C3G20G4C19A5T18D6A17A7T16C8G15G9C14C10G13C11)G12)STRUCTURE 1 with D6 being the abasic site and which is referred to as AD, and the apurinic duplex, d(C1d(G22G2C21C3G20G4C19A5T18D6C17A7T16C8G15G9C14C10G13C11)G12)STRUCTURE 2 which is referred to as CD, to allow examination of the differences between apurinic and apyrimidinic sites. The structural features of AD can be compared with those of a damaged DNA with thymine glycol (57Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9227-9236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in the same position as the abasic site. The structural features of AD can also be compared with a DNA in which the abasic site is in the middle of a curved DNA stretch (11Wang K.Y. Parker S.A. Goljer I. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11629-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These comparisons indicate what may be some of the common and distinct features of damaged DNAs. NMR data were acquired at 500 MHz on a Varian Inova and at 400 MHz on a Varian Unityplus spectrometer, at Wesleyan, and at 500 MHz on a Bruker 500 MHz DMX spectrometer at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, using methods described previously (11Wang K.Y.

All of the Varian NMR data were processed using VNMR software, and all of the Bruker data were processed using Felix 95.0 software. All of the Varian two-dimensional data were obtained using States-Haberkorn and all of the Bruker data using TPPI. NOESY experiments on AD were run on the Bruker 500 at Madison with the sample in 2H2O at 25 °C with mixing times of 100 and 200 ms and a 1.6-s equilibration delay. The spectral width in each dimension was 5,000 Hz. 512 t1 increments were acquired with 64 transients/t1 point and 1024 complex points in the t2 dimension. The data were processed with a sinebell apodization in both dimensions before 2048 × 2048 Fourier transformation. These spectra were used for NOESY cross-peak quantification. NOESY experiments on CD were run on the Varian 500 with the sample in 2H2O at 15 °C with mixing times of 100 and 250 ms and a 1-s equilibration delay. The spectral width in each dimension was 6,000 Hz. 448 t1 increments were acquired with 48 transients/t1 point and 4096 complex points in the t2 dimension. The data were processed with a Gaussian weighting in both dimensions before 4096 × 1024 Fourier transformation. These spectra were used for NOESY cross-peak quantification. NOESY watergate experiments on CD were run on the Varian 500 with the sample in 90% H2O and 10%2H2O at 15 and at 5 °C with a mixing time of 100 ms using a 1-s equilibration delay. Spectral widths in both dimensions were 12,000 Hz, and processing with Gaussian weighting in both dimensions before a 4096 × 1024 Fourier transformation was used. ROESY experiments, with watergate suppression of the water resonance, on CD in 90% H2O and 10%2H2O, were run using the Varian 500 with the sample at 15, 5, and 1 °C with a mixing time of 50 ms and a 1-s equilibration delay. The spectral width was 12,000 Hz in both dimensions, and the data were transformed using Gaussian shifted weighting functions into 4096 × 1024 real points. Quiet-NOESY experiments (60Beger R.D. Arthanari H.B. Basu S. Bolton P.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar) on CD and AD were run on the Varian 400 with the sample in 2H2O at 15 °C with a mixing time of 250 ms and a 1-s equilibration delay. In the middle of the mixing time a 180° shaped Gaussian pulse was applied on the aromatic region in one experiment and on the methyl region in a separate Quiet-NOESY experiment. The spectral width in each dimension was 5,000 Hz. 256 t1 increments were acquired with 48 transients/t1 point and 4096 complex points in the t2 dimension. The data were processed using Gaussian apodization in both dimensions before 4096 × 1024 Fourier transformation. Band-selective TOCSY experiments (61Krishnamurthy V.V. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1996; 113: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were run on the Varian 400 with the samples in 2H2O and at 15 °C for CD and 27 °C for AD with mixing times of 70 ms and a 1-s equilibration delay. Two 180° Gaussian shaped pulses were applied to the H3′ region during the spin echo before the TOCSY spin lock. The spectral width in each dimension was 5,000 Hz. 300 t1 increments were acquired with 48 transients/t1 increment and 4096 complex points in the t2 dimension. The J scale for coupling to 31P was set to 2 and to 3 in separate experiments. The data were processed with a Gaussian apodization in both dimensions before 4096 × 1024 Fourier transformation. PECOSY spectra were acquired for the AD and CD samples at 400 MHz with31P decoupling during the evolution period. The data were collected as 2,000 complex points in t2 and 512 complex points in t1. The F2 spectral width was 3,200 Hz, and the F1 spectral width was 2,600 Hz. 256 transients were acquired for each t1 increment. A Gaussian weighting function was used in both dimensions, and the data set was zero filled to 2048 × 2048 real points. TOCSY experiments were run on AD and CD with a mixing time of 80 ms with the samples in 2H2O at 400 MHz. The water resonance was presaturated during the 1.5-s equilibrium delay. The spectral width in both dimensions was 6,000 Hz. 2,048 complex points were collected in the t2 dimension and 256 complex points in t1. Gaussian weighting was applied before Fourier transformation into 2048 × 1024 real points. A series of one-dimensional inversion recovery experiments was run on AD and CD to allow determination of the chemical shifts of the adenine H2 resonances on the basis of their relatively long T1values. These spectra were acquired with the samples in2H2O at 400 MHz. An equilibrium delay of 12 s was used, and the inversion recovery delay time was arrayed from 0.3 to 2.0 s in equal steps. The Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer was used to obtain a 125-ms ROESY experiment on AD in 2H2O with the sample at 25 °C. A spectral width of 6,000 Hz was used in each dimension. The data were collected as 2,000 complex t1 points and 512 complex t2 points. Gaussian weighting was applied in both dimensions, and the data were zero filled to 2,000 × 2,000 real points. The spectra were assigned using the procedures described previously for abasic site-containing DNAs (11Wang K.Y. Parker S.A. Goljer I. Bolton P.H.

In the α form the H1′ is spatially closer to the H2“ than the H2′. In the β form the H1′ is spatially closer to the H2′ than the H2”. AD NOE cross-peak volumes were quantified from the data obtained at 500 MHz at mixing times of 100 and 200 ms using FELIX 95.0 software. The NOE cross-peak volumes, of CD, were quantified in the data obtained at 500 MHz with mixing times of 100 and 250 ms using VNMR software. For each assigned cross-peak the volume over a standard area was determined. Structure refinement by restrained molecular dynamics using X-PLOR 3.1 was performed as described previously (11Wang K.Y.

The optimum weighting of the NOE constraints was found to be 60 kcal/mol, and the experimental volumes were used as the constraints. For AD, at each mixing time, 233 NOE volume constraints were used for the α and for the β structure, and the refinements of the two structures were carried out independently. For CD, at each mixing time, 258 NOE volume constraints were used for the two β structures, and the refinements of the two structures were carried out independently. During each structure calculation 34 dihedral constraints for the ribose (H1′-C1′-C2′-H2′-and H1′-C1′-C2′-H2′′) were used as well as 20 dihedral constraints for the backbone (P-O3′-C3′-H3′) with a weighting of 40 kcal/mol. For all four structures 28 hydrogen bonds were used for the 10 base pairs with a weighting of 40 kcal/mol, and 2 hydrogen bonds were used on the bound water protons to the abasic site hydroxyl and to the proton acceptors on the adenine or cytosine across from the abasic site with a weighting of 40 kcal/mol. The hydrogen bond proton-oxygen distance constraints were set to 1.86 ± 0.20 Å, and the nitrogen-proton distance constraints were set to 1.85 ± 0.20 Å. The nonbonded interaction cutoff was set to 11.5 Å. The distance over which the nonbonded interaction was switched from on to off was 9.5 to 10.5 Å. The distance cutoff for the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding interactions was set to 7.5 Å, and the switching function was applied from 5.5 to 6.5 Å. Starting structures were generated from canonical B-DNA by replacing the base with a hydroxyl group at the C1′ α or β position of the abasic site. The α and β structures were refined separately using separate topology files. In the β form the O4′-C2′-C1′-H1′ dihedral has the same orientation as in a normal deoxyribose, and in the α form the opposing orientation was used. Starting structures were energy minimized by 100 steps of Powell's conjugate gradient minimization using X-PLOR. Relaxation matrix refinements were carried out at 300 K with a radial dielectric. The minimized structures thus obtained were then subjected to 100 steps of minimization using all of the constraints of the force field. This was followed by a relaxation matrix simulation and 200 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. Each trajectory was run for 200 ps, and each trajectory appeared to reach equilibrium after 100 ps. The structures from 140 to 148 ps were used to generate"

Cysteines in each variant could be labeled both in native and proteinase-complexed α1-proteinase inhibitors. Pre-reaction with 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-chloride or fluorescein prevented complex formation only with the D298C variant. Label at Cys121 greatly increased the stoichiometry of inhibition for thrombin and gave an emission spectrum that discriminated between native, cleaved, and proteinase-complexed serpin and between complexes with trypsin and thrombin, whereas fluorophore at residue 159 on helix F was almost insensitive to complex formation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements for covalent and non-covalent complexes were consistent with a location of the proteinase at the end of the serpin distal from the original location of the reactive center loop. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a serpin-proteinase complex in which the reactive center loop is fully inserted into β-sheet A, and the proteinase is at the far end of the serpin from its initial site of docking with the reactive center loop close to, but not obscuring, residue 121.

Serpins are a family of widely distributed, structurally homologous proteins (1Hunt L.T. Dayhoff M.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), many of which are inhibitors of serine proteinases (2Carrell R.W. Travis J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1985; 10: 20-24Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Whereas the many other families of protein inhibitors of serine proteinases, such as the Bowman-Birk, Kazal, and Kunitz families, inhibit target proteinases by forming tight non-covalent 1:1 complexes in which neither the proteinase nor the inhibitor undergoes significant structural change in most cases (3Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), serpins differ not only by apparently forming covalent 1:1 acyl enzyme complexes with their target proteinases (4Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), but by undergoing a major conformational change during, and as an essential part of, the inhibition process (5Gettins P. Patston P.A. Schapira M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because of the requirement for conformational change as part of the inhibition mechanism, knowledge of the structure of the serpin-proteinase complex is critical for an understanding of how serpins inhibit their target proteinases through kinetic trapping of a normal covalent acyl enzyme intermediate on the proteinase substrate cleavage pathway. A previous proposal that a major movement of the proteinase occurs following cleavage of the scissile bond (6Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) has been supported by two recent studies (7Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The other study (7Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pittsburgh and the proteinase to compare the inter-fluorophore separation in the normal covalent serpin-proteinase complex with that in the non-covalent complex with the non-functional anhydroproteinase. This study, although not able to precisely define the position of the proteinase in the complex, demonstrated a movement of the proteinase of at least 21 Å upon formation of the kinetically trapped covalent complex. We describe here more extensive mapping of this serpin-proteinase complex by using wild-type α1PI Pittsburgh and 4 new single cysteine variants. These well separated cysteines were used as follows: (i) to probe the accessibility of the cysteine in native and proteinase-complexed serpin, (ii) to determine the effect of derivatization of the cysteine on the ability to form covalent complex, and (iii) for introduction of fluorophores, both as probes of the local environment and for fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements. By these approaches we have been able to place further constraints on the possible structures of the serpin-proteinase complex and to show that it probably requires movement of the proteinase to the bottom of the serpin and therefore full insertion of the cleaved reactive center loop into β-sheet A. In this location the proteinase is not in contact with the outer face of helix F. Our findings are thus consistent with the model of Wright and Scarsdale (6Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on a double-stranded pET16b plasmid (Novagen) containing α1PI cDNA, using the Quikchange method (Stratagene). Double-stranded template DNA of two complementary primers containing the mutation was annealed and extended with Pfu DNA polymerase during thermal cycling. The pET16b plasmid contained an N-terminally modified α1PI cDNA that lacked coding sequence for the first 5 residues (10Johansen H. Sutiphong J. Sathe G. Jacobs P. Cravador A. Bollen A. Rosenberg M. Shatzman A. Mol. Biol. & Med. 1987; 4: 291-305PubMed Google Scholar), inserted between theNcoI and BamHI subcloning sites of the vector. The sequences for the coding strands of the mismatch primers were as follows (mismatch codons are underlined): M358R, 5′-GAG GCC ATA CCCAGA TCT ATC CCC CCC; C232S, 5′-AAC ATC CAG CACAGC AAG AAG CTG TCC AG; T85C, G AAT TTC AAC CTCTGT GAG ATT CCG GAG G; S121C, GGC CTG TTC CTCTGT GAG GGC CTG AAG; D159C, G AAA CAG ATC AACTGT TAC GTG GAG AAG GG; D298C, AC TGG AAC CTA TTGTCT GAA GAG CGT CCT G. All α1PI variants used in this study carried the Pittsburgh (M358R) mutation, and all except the wild-type Pittsburgh variant carried the C232S mutation, so that all variants contained only one free cysteine residue and all contained a P1 arginine (Pittsburgh mutation (11Owen M.C.

A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing in the host plasmid. The plasmids containing the mutated α1PI genes were transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen). 5 ml of an overnight culture was used to inoculate 0.5 liters of LB broth containing 125 mg/ml ampicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a shaking water bath to an A 600 nm of 0.5. IPTG (0.4 mm) was added to induce expression of α1PI, and the cells were allowed to grow for a further 2.5–3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was collected and washed twice with cold PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme. The suspension was sonicated using four 30-s pulses. Inclusion bodies were harvested by spinning the lysed cells at 10,000 × g for 45 min. The pellet containing the inclusion bodies was washed twice with buffer A containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma). The inclusion bodies were finally dissolved in 10 ml of buffer A containing 8 m guanidinium hydrochloride by vortexing and sonication. Any non-solubilized inclusion bodies were spun down at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The typical yield of solubilized protein at this stage was ∼20 mg, determined by BCA assay, from 0.5-liter cell culture. Solubilized denatured α1PI was refolded by dropwise dilution over a period of 20 min of the 8 m guanidinium hydrochloride solution into 250 ml of a 4 °C solution of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The diluted solution was extensively dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm EDTA to remove the guanidinium hydrochloride. After dialysis the solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C and 8000 × g and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter to remove any precipitated protein. The refolded α1PI contained dimers and higher order oligomers in addition to monomers. Monomeric α1PI was purified in two steps. The first step was ion exchange chromatography on DE52 (Whatman), using a linear 0–0.25 m NaCl gradient. This gave a sharp early eluting peak for the monomer and a broader later eluting peak for higher order aggregates. The pooled monomeric fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Bis-Tris-propane buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and rechromatographed, where necessary, on a MonoQ column equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted by a 0–0.3 m NaCl gradient. Monomeric α1PI eluted as a very sharp single peak. The purity of all preparations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and by PAGE under non-denaturing conditions to confirm that all material was monomeric. Preparations were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG8000, quickly frozen in aliquots, and stored at −70 °C until needed. Anhydrotrypsin was prepared from commercial crystallized trypsin (Sigma) by alkaline β-elimination of the phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride adduct according to published procedures (14Ako H. Foster R.J. Ryan C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 47: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Following the reaction, the solution was treated with Phe-Phe-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (20 μm) to inhibit any remaining or regenerated active trypsin and acidified to pH 3.0. β-Anhydrotrypsin was purified from the reaction mixture by chromatography on a soybean trypsin inhibitor affinity matrix. The absence of proteolytic activity in the product was confirmed by activity assay using the chromogenic trypsin substrate S-2222. β-Trypsin was prepared from TPCK-treated commercial trypsin by affinity chromatography using the same soybean trypsin inhibitor affinity matrix. All α1PI variants were labeled with fluorescein by reaction of the single free cysteine with 5 iodoacetamido-fluorescein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The protein (10–40 μm) was reacted with a 2-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol for 15 min at room temperature and then with a 10–15-fold molar excess of 5-IAF. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C. Excess reagent was removed by dialysis for 24 h against 10,000 volumes of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG8000. The extent of labeling was determined spectrophotometrically using the absorbance at 495 nm for determination of the fluorescein concentration and the absorbance at 280 nm, corrected for the contribution from fluorescein at this wavelength, which was determined to be 25% of the absorbance at 495 nm based on the spectrum of the adduct of IAF with β-mercaptoethanol, to determine the protein concentration. For all preparations the extent of labeling was close to 1 eq per mol or less, with a range from 0.59 to 1.06. This range represents the determined stoichiometries for preparations made at different times under somewhat different reactant concentrations and does not necessarily reflect intrinsic differences in reactivity of the various cysteines. Where comparisons of labeling efficiency are made elsewhere, reactions were carried out under identical conditions for each α1PI species. Extinction coefficients of 27,000 (15Pannell R. Johnson D. Travis J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5439-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and 82,000 m−1 cm−1 were used for α1PI and fluorescein, respectively. α1PI variants were labeled with NBD by reaction with NBD-chloride. α1PI, 10–20 μm, in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% PEG8000, was first reduced by addition of dithiothreitol in slight molar excess and incubation at room temperature for 15 min. A 10-fold excess of NBD-chloride was added and the reaction allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C in the dark. The sample was then dialyzed against the same buffer for 24 h at 4 °C. The extent of labeling was calculated spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient of NBD at 420 nm of 13,000 m−1 cm−1 and an extinction coefficient for the protein at 280 nm of 27,000m−1 cm−1. The contribution of NBD at 280 nm is small. Labeling stoichiometries of 0.8–1.0 were obtained. β-Trypsin and β-anhydrotrypsin were labeled with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate while immobilized on soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose beads (i) to permit equivalent reaction conditions for anhydrotrypsin as for trypsin without concern for autodigestion by free trypsin, and (ii) to provide a ready means of selecting only those labeled proteins that were still active in binding to protein inhibitors. About 300 μl of wet soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose beads were equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.0, and then mixed with 700 μl of either β-trypsin or β-anhydrotrypsin, followed by gentle rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with 700 μl of 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 4.0, to remove any unbound protein and then four times with 700 μl of 0.1 msodium carbonate, pH 9.0, to raise the pH. The beads were resuspended in 700 μl of 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.0, and 10 μl of a 10 mm solution of tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate in N,N-dimethylformamide were added. The reaction was allowed to proceed, with gentle rocking, at room temperature for 2–4 h, depending on the degree of labeling wanted. The beads were then washed four times with 700 μl of 10 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.0, to remove excess reagent and any free protein. Labeled protein was eluted with 500 μl of 0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 2.4. The eluate was dialyzed overnight against 1000 volume of 1 mm HCl containing 10 mm CaCl2 and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove any precipitated material. The extent of labeling was determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients of 62,000m−1 cm−1 at 550 nm and 35,800m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm for tetramethylrhodamine and trypsin, respectively. The absorbance at 280 nm was first corrected for the contribution at that wavelength from tetramethylrhodamine, which was found empirically to be 28% of the absorbance at 550 nm. The extent of label incorporation was 0.47 mol/mol for trypsin and, for two separate preparations of anhydrotrypsin, 0.30 and 0.71 mol/mol. The sites of labeling in β-trypsin were identified by N-terminal sequencing of tetramethylrhodamine-labeled peptides isolated from a tryptic digest of the labeled protein. 140 μg of labeled β-trypsin was freeze-dried and dissolved in 50 μl of 8m guanidinium hydrochoride, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Dithiothreitol was added to 10 mm and the mixture incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Iodoacetic acid was added to 30 mm and allowed to react for 30 min at room temperature. The denatured labeled trypsin was diluted into 600 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmCaCl2 containing 5 μg of active β-trypsin and digested in the dark at 37 °C for 2 h, after which an additional 5 μg of β-trypsin was added. A second addition was made after a further 2 h, and the reaction was allowed to continue overnight. The tryptic digest was chromatographed on a C-18 reverse phase column, using a linear gradient from 80% buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water), 20% buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile, 9.9% water) to 35% buffer A, 65% buffer B. Peaks were monitored both for absorption at 280 nm and fluorescence at 550 nm. Two major peaks of approximately equal fluorescent intensity were obtained, as well as several much smaller ones, and were submitted for N-terminal sequence determination. The ability of the α1PI variants to form SDS-stable covalent complex with trypsin was assayed by 10% SDS-PAGE of the reaction products and visualization of the complex either by Coomassie staining for unlabeled complex or by fluorescence intensity for labeled complex. Typically 2–3 μg of α1PI was reacted for 10 s with trypsin at different molar ratios, ranging from 0.3:1 to 2:1 trypsin:α1PI, with α1PI fixed at 5–10 μm. This was sufficient time for the reaction to have gone to >99% completion based on the published rate constant for this reaction (7Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and confirmed empirically by the absence of unreacted serpin in lanes where the proteinase was in excess. This also confirmed that the serpin was >95% active. The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) was calculated by scanning densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were scanned, and the density of the bands corresponding to cleaved serpin and complex were measured. The intensity of the band for complex was corrected for the contribution from the proteinase, by assuming equal staining of the serpin and trypsin per unit weight. This was justified by a standard curve for trypsin and α1PI which showed comparable staining for both proteins on a weight basis and a linear dependence between amount of protein and band intensity in the range used for the experiments. This method was considered accurate for SI values in the range 1.1 to 5, corresponding to 91 to 20% complex, but incapable of determining SI where complex bands were so faint as to be not visible. SI values for fluorescein-labeled serpins were determined in an analogous way, except intensity of the fluorescent bands corresponding to cleaved and complexed bands were used, and no correction was needed for contribution from (unlabeled) trypsin. No error was thereby introduced for complex formed by unlabeled serpin. In cases where the degree of fluorescein labeling was close to 100%, so that all covalent complex was also fluorescent, or where labeling did not affect complex formation, independent quantitation of SI by both fluorescence and Coomassie Blue staining gave good agreement. 5–6 μg of either the Pittsburgh variant of α1PI or the cysteine mutants (T85C, D159C, S121C and D298C) in a total volume of 20 μl were reacted with 1 μg of β-trypsin (excess of α1PI to ensure that complex was not degraded by excess proteinase) to form the stable trypsin-α1PI complex. TLCK was added after a few seconds to a final concentration of 25 μm. In all reaction mixtures 1.5 μl of 1.8 mm IAF was added (final concentration was about 100 μm), and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min (to inactivate any unreacted probe). The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (12% acrylamide). A control reaction of IAF with TLCK-treated trypsin alone was carried out and showed no labeling of trypsin under the conditions used. Similar reactions were also carried out with thrombin as the proteinase, using comparable conditions as for the reactions with β-trypsin except that reaction was carried out for 8 min at room temperature (sufficient for complete reaction of the thrombin), and Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone was added to inactivate any free thrombin. All fluorescence measurements were made on a SPEX fluorolog scanning fluorimeter. NBD spectra were acquired by exciting at 420 nm and scanning from 440 to 580 nm. Fluorescein and rhodamine spectra were recorded by exciting at 340 nm and scanning from 460 to 640 nm. All slit widths were 4 nm. Measurements were made at 25 °C. For time courses the emission signal was monitored at 515 nm, where the contribution of rhodamine fluorescence is negligible. For energy transfer measurements the labeled serpin was between 50 and 150 nm, and the proteinase was at 2–3 times the serpin concentration. 1 mmbenzamidine was included in the cuvette as a competitive inhibitor of trypsin to slow down the reaction. NBD spectra were acquired at concentrations of 156 nm for the S121C variant and 400 nm for the D159C variant. The buffer used for all measurements was 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% PEG8000. To estimate the efficiency of energy transfer between fluorescein and rhodamine in the covalent complex, the fluorescence spectrum of the fluorescein-labeled serpin was recorded, and trypsin, either unlabeled or rhodamine-labeled, was then added to the cuvette in the presence of 1 mm benzamidine and the reaction followed by monitoring the change of fluorescein fluorescence at 515 nm. When a plateau was reached the fluorescence emission spectrum of the mixture was recorded. The amount of energy transfer for each variant was determined from the observed reduction in fluorescein fluorescence corrected for any contribution that arose solely from complex formation, which was determined from a control reaction using fluorescein-labeled α1PI and unlabeled β-trypsin. A correction was also made for the SI in every case, calculated as described above, although this was mostly a small correction. Percentages of energy transfer reported in Table III also take into account the stoichiometry of rhodamine labeling and are scaled to the efficiency expected at 1 mol/mol of label. The justification for such a scaling is that, for different degrees of labeling, a linear dependence of efficiency of transfer was found. Scaling to 1:1 treats each trypsin as having either zero or one labels and that label at any of the positions is equivalent. Although this is not likely to be strictly accurate, it should give a minimum value for the efficiency of energy transfer. Confirmation that the end point represented complete reaction of the serpin was from SDS-PAGE analysis of the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated reaction products, which also showed no evidence of cleavage of the proteinase in the complex by excess active proteinase.Table IIIFluorescence resonance energy transfer in complexes with β-trypsin or anhydrotrypsinPosition of fluoresceinFluorescence energy transferTrypsinAnhydrotrypsin%8534.51912122.5101597.71023218aFrom Ref. 7.77aFrom Ref. 7.298Not measurablebNo detectable complex formed (very high SI).<2a From Ref. 7Stratikos E.

Open table in a new tab For fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements on non-covalent complexes between anhydrotrypsin and serpin, fluorescein-labeled α1PI (30–50 nm) and rhodamine-labeled or unlabeled anhydrotrypsin (80–100 nm) were mixed and the spectra recorded. For each α1PI variant four series of spectra were recorded; labeled α1PI alone, labeled α1PI with unlabeled anhydrotrypsin, labeled α1PI with labeled anhydrotrypsin (0.3 label/mol), and labeled α1PI with labeled anhydrotrypsin (0.71 label/mol). The efficiency of energy transfer was estimated from the reduction in fluorescein emission intensity in the doubly labeled complex compared with complex with unlabeled anhydrotrypsin. The values were scaled to 1.0 label/mol and the results for the two different preparations of labeled anhydrotrypsin averaged. Spectra are the average of three consecutive scans. NBD-labeled S121C variant was reacted with trypsin, papain, or thrombin as described in the figure legend for Fig. 4. One aliquot of the reaction mixture was used for SDS-PAGE analysis, and another aliquot was diluted to a final concentration of 156 nm α1PI and the emission fluorescence spectrum recorded as described above. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel was scanned and the density of the bands used to estimate both the completeness of each reaction and the SI. Every reaction was found to be more than 95% complete. Previous studies on a recombinant Pittsburgh variant of α1PI (P1 Met → Arg) have shown that the cysteine at position 232 is quite accessible to nucleophiles (7Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), consistent with its exposed location in the crystal structure of α1PI. We found here that cysteine 232 is also accessible in the complex, since it could be comparably labeled with 5-IAF while in complex with both β-trypsin and thrombin, as judged by the intensity of fluorescence associated with the band of complex on SDS-PAGE (Table I, gel not shown). To carry out similar accessibility studies at different sites on the serpin, we created four new variants, each containing a single free cysteine at strategic locations on the serpin surface (Fig. 1). The choice of sites was guided by proposed models for the serpin-proteinase complex (6Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Wilczynska M.

https://openalex.org/W1980730103,"The role of ceramide as a second messenger in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated signal transduction has been much debated. It is supported by recent reports describing an expanding number of potential targets for this lipid, but is opposed by those describing how ceramide is not necessary for many TNF-mediated cellular events. In this paper, we directly compare the effects of the cell-permeable ceramide analogue, N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), with TNF, on NFκB function, a transcription factor whose activation is central to many TNF-mediated effects. We describe how C2-ceramide failed to drive κB-linked chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression in either HL60 promyelocytic or Jurkat T lymphoma cells. Furthermore, it had no effect on TNF-mediated transcription of this reporter gene. However, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis following cell stimulation with this ceramide analogue revealed a dose-responsive activation of NFκB, which was not apparent following cell treatment with the inactive dihydro form. Activated complexes from treated cells were shown to contain predominantly the p50 subunit, in contrast to complexes from TNF-treated cells, where both p50 and p65/RelA subunits were present. The specific activation of p50 homodimeric complexes by C2-ceramide, which are known to lack trans-activating activity, was strongly suggested from these data. Further investigations revealed that C2-ceramide had only a marginal effect on IκBα degradation but strongly promoted the processing of p105 to its p50 product as revealed by immunoblot analysis. The increase in p50 arising from the processing of its p105 precursor was further established from p105/p50 ratios obtained by scanning densitometric analysis of bands from immunoblots. TNF, on the other hand, stimulated both IκBα degradation and p105 processing, in accordance with previous findings. Furthermore, the effect of TNF on NFκB activation was rapid, whereas C2-ceramide required an optimal treatment time of 1 h. Interestingly, TNF was found to increase ceramide in cells but only after a 1-h contact time. Our data therefore suggest that ceramide promotes the activation of NFκB complexes that lack transactivating activity by enhanced processing of p105.

NFκB is a member of the Rel family of transcription factors (31Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). It is activated by a wide range of stimuli, including TNF, interleukin-1, UV irradiation (reviewed in Ref. 32Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4600) Google Scholar), and chemotherapeutic drugs (12Strum J.C. Small G.W. Pauig S.B. Daniel L.W. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). The mechanism of NFκB activation has been the subject of much scrutiny. It binds to a discrete nucleotide sequence (5′-GGGACTTCC-3′) in the upstream regions of genes that code for mediators of the immune, acute phase, and inflammatory responses, thereby regulating their expression (32Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4600) Google Scholar). The activation of NFκB can occur by two mechanisms. The prototypical pathway involves its liberation from an inactive complex with the inhibitor protein, IκB, which resides in the cytosol (31Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 32Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4600) Google Scholar). Several forms of IκB have been identified (34Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5587) Google Scholar), with particular attention focusing on IκBα. In resting cells, it is complexed to the NFκB heterodimer, typically comprising p50 and p65/RelA subunits. Following cell stimulation, a pathway is activated that culminates in the phosphorylation of IκBα on two serine residues (Ser32 and Ser36) (35Traenckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), which tags it for degradation by the proteosome (36Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), leading to the nuclear translocation of the NFκB heterodimer. Recently, a pathway activated by TNF involving TRAF-2, an NFκB-inducing kinase, and two novel kinases termed IKK-1 and IKK-2 (or IKK-α and IKK-β) has been described (37Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), with both IKKs phosphorylating IκBα (39Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 40Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Another less well defined pathway for NFκB activation has also been described (31Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The p50 subunit of NFκB is generated following processing from its precursor, p105 (41Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Proteolysis results in the removal of an inhibitory C-terminal domain containing seven ankyrin repeats, a motif present in IκB proteins, revealing a nuclear translocation signal for this subunit. Specifically, a 68-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal PEST domain of p105 contains multiple serines that are phosphorylated (42MacKichan M.L. Logeat F. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6084-6091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by an as yet unidentified kinase, prior to proteosome-directed proteolytic degradation (43Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Processing of p105 complexed to p65/RelA would allow the heterodimer to translocate into the nucleus in an analogous manner to that which occurs following IκBα proteolysis. In addition, p50 homodimers, which have been shown to be transcriptional repressors (44Kang S.-M. Tran A.-C. Grilli M. Lenardo M.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1452-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), would also translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, p50 could complex with p65/RelA and c-Rel, giving rise to heterodimers with transcriptional potential. p105 processing has been shown to be stimulated by TNF, phorbol esters, and double-stranded RNA (45Mellits K.H. Hay R.T. Goodbourne S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5059-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 46Mercurio F. Didonata J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 707-718Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The activation of NFκB family members may therefore be regulated by this pathway in parallel with that mediating IκB degradation in response to the same signal. The mechanism by which ceramide can trigger either of the pathways leading to NFκB activation is unresolved, with conflicting results being presented (47Dbaibo G.S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17762-17766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kuno K. Sukegawa K. Ishikawa Y. Orii T. Matsushima K. Int.

Here, we have compared the effect of a commonly used short chain cell-permeable analogue of ceramide,N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), with TNF in four independent assays of NFκB function. We have found that although C2-ceramide can activate NFκB as judged by gel shift analysis, prolonged treatment times are required and only a marginal increase in IκBα degradation is observed. Furthermore, there is no effect on NFκB-linked reporter gene expression. However, C2-ceramide can induce p105 processing, with NFκB complexes predominantly comprising p50 homodimers. In contrast, TNF-activated complexes contain both p50 homodimeric and p50/p65 heterodimeric forms of NFκB. TNF promotes both IκBα and p105 processing and as expected, induces NFκB-linked gene expression. Our results may therefore help to resolve some of the controversy in this area, in that although ceramide does not appear to be involved in the pathway leading to IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, it may signal p105 processing in response to TNF.

Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). NFκB complexes were resolved on 5% acrylamide gels and identified following autoradiography. To identify the subunit components of activated NFκB complexes and the specificity of the binding reaction, supershift analysis and competition studies were carried out as described previously (33Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), using antibodies described under “Experimental Procedures” to individual NFκB subunit components and mutant/wild type unlabeled NFκB consensus sequence, respectively. Equal amounts of whole cell lysate protein (as indicated) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose, and IκBα or p50/p105 immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (33Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000 and 1:2000 for IκBα and p50/p105, respectively. The blots were developed by ECL according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Ceramide was quantified by the diacylglycerol kinase assay (10Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) with modifications as described (33Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The level of ceramide in HL60 cells following treatment with TNFα or not (control) was determined by comparison with a standard curve generated with known amounts of ceramide (ceramide type III; Sigma). In our first experiments with C2-ceramide, we attempted to mimic the stimulatory effect of TNF on an NFκB-linked reporter gene construct. HL60 or Jurkat were therefore transfected with a gene construct containing five NFκB sites upstream of a CAT reporter gene. Transfected cells were then stimulated with C2-ceramide or TNF. At 10 μmC2-ceramide no increase in CAT activity was observed over control values (unstimulated cells) in either Jurkat (Fig. 1 A) or HL60 cells (Fig. 1 B). 30 ng/ml TNF, as expected, stimulated NFκB-driven gene expression, causing a 4–6-fold increase over controls in Jurkat T cells. A 2-fold stimulation over control levels was seen in HL60 cells. Co-incubation of Jurkat with both C2-ceramide and TNF resulted in a similar response to that seen with TNF alone (Fig. 1 C). These results suggested that treatment of cells with ceramide had no effect on NFκB-linked gene expression. We next tested whether ceramide could activate NFκB in these cells, as has been reported by others (13Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 14Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13760-13765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C2-ceramide dose-dependently activated NFκB in HL60 cells, as was demonstrated by the detection of protein-DNA complexes in nuclear extracts from ceramide-treated cells (Fig. 2 A). This effect was evident from 1 μm and contact times of 1 h were required to see an effect. Stimulation of HL60 cells with both C2-ceramide and TNF resulted in a modest potentiation of NFκB activation in comparison with that seen with TNF alone (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8). The dihydro form of C2-ceramide (which should be ineffective, because it lacks a critical 4,5-trans double in the sphingoid base backbone) was inactive (Fig. 2 B). TNF strongly activated NFκB in both cell types (Fig. 2, A and C,lane 7) and was found to increase ceramide levels in HL60 causing a 2.64 ± 0.29-fold increase over control values after 1 h of stimulation, as shown in Fig. 1 C. C2-ceramide also activated NFκB in Jurkat T cells over a similar concentration range effective in HL60 cells and a contact time of 1 h (Fig. 2 D). We next examined the NFκB complex activated by C2-ceramide in more detail. Binding specificity of activated complexes from C2-ceramide-treated HL60 cells was demonstrated by competition studies. Excess unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the NFκB consensus sequence inhibited the appearance of retarded complexes, whereas a mutant oligonucleotide had no effect at equivalent concentrations (Fig. 3 A). We then determined the composition of the activated complexes from HL60 cells treated with either C2-ceramide or TNF. To achieve this supershift analysis was performed using specific antisera to p50 and p65/RelA. The complexes were electrophoresed further than usual to optimize resolution. Fig. 3 B shows that the complexes activated by TNF differ markedly from those induced by C2-ceramide (compare lanes 4 and 1). TNF induces two main complexes. Treatment of extracts with anti-p65 antiserum inhibited the formation of the upper complex (lane 5), whereas anti-p50 antiserum affected both upper and lower complexes (lane 6) and caused a further retardation of the DNA probe. In contrast, the C2-ceramide complex was only marginally affected by the anti-p65 antiserum (lane 2). However, this complex was almost completely supershifted by anti-p50 anti-serum (lane 3), indicating that p50 was much more prevalent than p65/RelA in the C2-ceramide-activated NFκB complex, whereas both were present in the TNF-activated complex. HL60 cells treated with C2-ceramide or TNF at concentrations that resulted in NFκB activation were next examined for degradation of IκBα. A rapid and marked degradation was observed following stimulation with TNF (Fig. 4 A) as determined by immunoblotting. The presence of a doublet (lane 2), prior to complete degradation, was most likely because of the phosphorylation of this protein. IκBα appeared to be completely degraded by 15 min (lane 3). Resynthesis restored IκBα levels within 60 min to the level of the unstimulated cells. In contrast, C2-ceramide treatment resulted in a more marginal degradation of IκBα, complete degradation not being evident at any point (lanes 6–8). We next determined the effect of TNF and C2-ceramide on p105 and p50 levels in HL60. A time course revealed that treatment of HL60 for 60 min with 2 ng/ml TNF resulted in a modest increase in p50 levels with a concomitant decrease in p105 (Fig. 4 B, comparelanes 1 and 4). A more marked effect was seen with 100 μm C2-ceramide, where a pronounced degradation of p105 was observed (lane 8). This effect can be seen more clearly when the ratio of p105 to p50 is determined for each sample by analyzing the intensity of each band from the immunoblots by densitometry (Fig. 4 C). This allows one to correct for loading variability between samples and reveals more accurately the precursor (p105)/product (p50) relationship for each sample. A clear increase in p50 with a concomitant decrease in p105 can be seen for both TNF and more particularly for C2-ceramide (Fig. 4 C). The effect of ceramide was also shown to be concentration-dependent, with both 40 and 100 μm showing an increase in p50 (Fig. 4 D). The degradation of p105 was most evident at 100 μmC2-ceramide. Taken together, these data suggest that in HL60 cells, the lack of effect of C2-ceramide on transactivation by NFκB, despite the presence of NFκB complexes, can be explained by p105 processing in excess of IκBα degradation. This would shift the balance of Rel-dependent transcription in the direction of nontransactivating (p50/p50) DNA binding forms of NFκB. Ceramide has emerged as a second messenger implicated in multiple cellular responses, such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 30Hannun Y.A.

https://openalex.org/W2050867289,"The silk of lepidopteran insects has been studied extensively as proteins of two categories: the fibroins, which are produced in the posterior section of silk glands, and the sericins, which are secreted in the middle section. We now describe a third category that is named seroins to accentuate the fact that both the sericin- and the fibroin-producing cells participate in seroin secretion. Using a probe derived from the N-terminal sequences of a 23-kDa components of Galleria mellonella silk, we isolated silk gland-specific cDNA encoding 167 amino acids, of which 17 constitute the signal peptide. The following 14 residues match the N-terminal sequences of the 23- and 22.5-kDa silk proteines. The reaction of these proteins with concanavalin A and the presence of two glycosylation sites in the seroin peptide sequence indicate that seroin is secreted in two forms that both contain a mannose-rich sugar moiety. Seroin is distinguished from other silk proteins by high proline content (34 residues or 20.26% by weight), lack of cysteines, and the presence of two kinds of short amino acid repeats. Theseroin gene is expressed in both the posterior and middle silk gland sections. The expression fluctuates during development in correlation with the feeding regime and the changes in hormone titers:seroin mRNA is high in the silk glands of feeding larvae, declines at ecdysis, reaches a maximum during cocoon spinning, and thereafter rapidly drops to an undetectable level. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that the drop is caused by ecdysteroid hormones and is prevented by juvenile hormones. N-terminal sequencing of several silk proteins of Bombyx mori revealed that the 8- and 13-kDa proteins share 5 or 6 out of 10 identified amino acids with the N terminus of Galleriaseroin and obviously represent seroin homologues. The result suggests that seroin-type proteins are a general component of lepidopteran silk.

The result suggests that seroin-type proteins are a general component of lepidopteran silk. The labial glands of insects usually produce saliva used in digestion, but in the larvae of many caddisflies (Trichoptera), moths, and butterflies (Lepidoptera) they secrete a solid fiber, the silk, and are therefore called the silk glands. The posterior sections of the two silk glands (PSG) 1The abbreviations used are: PSG, posterior section(s) of silk glands; MSG, middle section(s) of silk glands; H-fibroin, heavy chain fibroin; L-fibroin, light chain fibroin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; nt, nucleotide(s); 20E, 20-hydroxyecdysone; JH, juvenile hormone(s); tsp, transcription start point; UTR, untranslated region. generate heavy chain fibroin (H-fibroin), light chain fibroin (L-fibroin), and protein p25, which are assembled into an insoluble fibroin thread. The middle silk gland sections (MSG) secrete several sericins that provide this thread with sticky coating. The anterior silk gland sections merge into an outlet terminating on the spinneret from which a single silk cord is spun (1Sehnal F. Akai H. Int. J. Insect Morphol. Embryol. 1990; 19: 79-132Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The analysis of silk proteins is difficult because only some of the sericins are water-soluble (see Fig. 2). Most of our knowledge of silk comes from molecular biology studies on the major commercial silk producer, the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori. It has been demonstrated that H-fibroin, a 350-kDa polypeptide (2Oyama F. Mizuno S. Shimura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 96: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), is linked by disulfide bonds to the 25-kDa L-fibroin and is also associated with two p25 proteins of 27 and 30 kDa (3Tanaka K. Mori K. Mizuno S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The sericins from MSG include several glycoproteins with apparent molecular masses ranging from 65 to 400 kDa (4Gamo T. Inokuchi T. Laufer H. Insect Biochem. 1977; 7: 285-295Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5Sinohara H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1979; 63B: 87-91Google Scholar). Sericins are characterized by unbalanced amino acid composition, with serine accounting for 16–42% of all amino acids (6Prudhomme J.C. Couble P. Garel J.P. Daillie J. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology. 10. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 571-594Google Scholar). It has been proven that genes for H-fibroin (7Suzuki Y. Brown D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 63: 409-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar),L-fibroin (8Kimura K. Oyama F. Ueda H. Mizuno S. Shimura K. Experientia. 1985; 41: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and p25 protein (9Couble P. Moine A. Garel A. Prudhomme J.C. Dev. Biol. 1983; 97: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) are specifically expressed in PSG, whereas the two sericin genes, Ser1 (10Michaille J.J. Couble P. Prudhomme J.-C. Garel A. Biochimie. 1986; 68: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Ser2 (11Couble P. Michaille J.J. Couble M.L. Prudhomme J.-C. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), are active in MSG. Homologous silk components were discovered at the gene or protein level in another lepidopteran, the waxmoth Galleria mellonella. The L-fibroin and p25 of this species were identified by partial sequencing of isolated silk proteins and as cDNA clones; the deduced amino acid sequences proved to be 43 and 51% identical withBombyx L-fibroin and p25, respectively, with conserved positions of all cysteine residues (three in L-fibroin, eight in p25) (12Z̆urovec M. Vas̆ková M. Kodrı́k D. Sehnal F. Kumaran A.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Z̆urovec M. Kodrı́k D. Yang C. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A lower amino acid conservation, but a similar tandem distribution of the amino acid repeats, and virtually identical gene organization were found in the H-fibroingene. 2M. Z̆urovec, C. Yang, D. Kodrı́k, and F. Sehnal, unpublished observations. Two sericin genes, resembling Ser1 and Ser2 of Bombyx, were identified in Galleria as MSG-specific cDNAs, which were partially sequenced (14Z̆urovec M. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Kumaran A.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 55-67Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition to the major silk proteins described above, several components of low molecular weight were detected in the silk of bothBombyx and Galleria (15Sasaki T. Noda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Grzelak K. Couble P. Garel A. Kludkiewicz B. Alrouz H. Insect Biochem. 1988; 18: 223-228Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Some of them occur in the silk in considerable amounts (17Kodrı́k D. Acta Entomol. Bohemoslov. 1992; 87: 332-335Google Scholar), suggesting that they may have important functions, possibly similar to those of L-fibroin and p25. The L-fibroin and p25 proteins are essential for the transformation of H-fibroin from a liquid column to the solid thread during spinning (18Shimura K. Kikuchi A. Ohmoto K. Katagata Y. Hyodo A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Tokutake S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 187: 413-417Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The possibility cannot be excluded that some of the unknown silk components are smaller forms of the larger silk proteins. For example,Galleria gene p25, which yields the glycosylated silk proteins of 29 and 30 kDa (13Z̆urovec M. Kodrı́k D. Yang C. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), encodes a secretory peptide of only 23 kDa that could occur in the silk. We decided to investigate whether silk proteins of corresponding sizes did not include the unglycosylated version of p25. In course of this work, we identified a novel silk protein type that differs from all the others structurally and by the site of production. It is called seroin to illustrate that it is an ingredient of both the sericin and the fibroin silk fractions. In this paper, we report the cDNA sequence that encodesGalleria seroin and show that this peptide is secreted as two water-insoluble glycoproteins of 22.5 and 23 kDa. The spatial, developmental, and hormonal control of seroin gene expression is described. We also provide evidence for the presence of proteins with seroin N-terminal sequence in the silk ofBombyx. Larvae of the waxmoth,G. mellonella L., were reared on a semiartificial diet (20Sehnal F. Z. Wiss. Zool. 1966; 174: 53-82Google Scholar) at 30 °C, and those of the domestic silkworm, B. mori (Japanese hybrid NO2 × CO2) were reared on mulberry leaves at room temperature. Silk glands were dissected from water-anesthetized larvae, and in most cases they were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. In some cases, the middle and posterior parts of silk glands were separated, and muscles, fat body, and the remaining body carcass were also preserved at −80 °C. Some insects were allowed to spin cocoons that were used for protein analysis. Clean cocoons were chopped to small pieces, and samples of 200 mg were either boiled four times for 1 min in 2 ml of water (each washing was followed by a short centrifugation) or just rinsed in cold water. Silk proteins were then solubilized by soaking the samples for 48 h in 1.5 ml solutions containing 10 mμ Tris (pH 7.0), 2% SDS, 8m urea, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Insoluble heavy chain fibroin was removed by centrifugation (5 min at 60 ×g) and 100-μl aliquots of the supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 20% gel. The proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue staining and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, from which selected bands were cut out and sent for N-terminal microsequencing (21Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the commercial facility of the Medical College of Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI). Proteins electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane were probed for the presence of sugars with the lectins concanavalin A, lentil agglutinin, peanut agglutinin, and wheat germ agglutinin (all from Lectinola, Prague), which were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (22Grubhoffer L. Guirakhoo F. Heinz F.X. Kunz C. Kocourek J. Freed D.L. Lectins: Biology, Biochemistry, Clinical Biochemistry. 7. Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis1990: 313-319Google Scholar). Conjugates bound to the blots were revealed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine. Galleria silk gland cDNA library in λ gt10 (14Z̆urovec M. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Kumaran A.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 55-67Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was screened with degenerate 30-mer oligoprobe that was derived from the N-terminal sequences of the 23-kDa silk proteins. The probe (10 pmol) was end-labeled with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP; free nucleotides were removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-25. Hybridization was performed at 36 °C in 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and washing was at room temperature twice in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS and twice in 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS. Positive cDNA clones were purified, and the inserts were subcloned in pBluescript SK(+/−) (Stratagene) and sequenced with the Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The library was rescreened with radiolabeled (Random Primed Labeling kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 5′-fragment (356 nt) of a cDNA insert to isolate the full-length cDNA. The same fragment was employed as a probe in all subsequent nucleic acid analyses. DNASTAR software and FASTA, BLAST, and other network services were used to analyze the sequencing data. Primer extension was carried out in the standard way 3C. Yang, X. Teng, M. Z̆urovec, K. Scheller, and F. Sehnal, submitted for publication. using the 19-mer oligonucleotide shown in Fig. 1. The annealing reaction with 50 μg of total RNA from silk glands of day 3 last instar larvae was done at 32 °C for 16 h. Northern and dot blot analysis were performed as described previously (24Yang C. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 32: 353-362Crossref Google Scholar), using the 356-nt fragment as probe. Relative amounts of hybridized RNA were assessed by scanning the autoradiographs with a CAMAG TLC Scanner II densitometer. The maximal content, which was found in mobile prepupae, was taken as 100%, and values established at other times were expressed relative to this amount. Effects of hormones and protein synthesis inhibitors on the mRNA content were quantified by measuring radioactivity of posthybridized Northern blots of the corresponding RNA bands. Radioactivity in other areas was regarded as background and was subtracted. RNAs from the control and experimental glands were electrophoresed in parallel lanes and transferred onto one blot. The maximal value established on each such blot was taken as 100%, and other values were expressed as its percentage. Each analysis was repeated three or four times, and the results were pooled. Aliquots of the genomic DNA from day 3 last instar larvae were digested with EcoRI, EcoRV, SalI, andXbaI, respectively, and subjected to standard Southern analysis with seroin cDNA probe. Galleria prepupae at an advanced stage of cocoon spinning 48–60 h before pupal ecdysis were topically treated with juvenile hormone bioanalogue W-328 (25Kuldová J. Wimmer Z. Hrdý I. Roman̆uk M. Sehnal F. Acta Entomol. Bohemoslov. 1990; 87: 332-335Google Scholar). Each insect received 1 μg of W-328 in 2 μl of acetone, and the controls were treated with pure solvent. Silk glands were usually dissected 12 h before pupal ecdysis. Most hormonal treatments were done in vitro. Silk glands were dissected from day 6 last instar larvae (onset of cocoon spinning) and transferred to amino acid-enriched Graces's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), which was supplemented with streptomycin (20 μg/ml) and either kanamycin sulfate (0.05 mg/ml) or ampicillin (10 units/ml). A pair of silk glands was placed in 0.5 ml of medium in a glass vial coated with polyethylene glycol 20,000 (26Sehnal F. Baronio P. Michalik J. Kludkiewicz B. Sericologia. 1987; 27: 643-653Google Scholar). Hormones 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) (5 μg/ml) and/or juvenile hormone II (20 ng/ml) were added to the medium in acetone (5 μl of acetone per 0.5 ml of medium). The culture was carried out under gentle shaking for 24 h at 27 °C; the medium was replaced at 12 h. In a few cases, cycloheximide (40 μg/ml) or anisomycin (10 μg/ml), which efficiently inhibited protein synthesis in explanted silk glands (27Jindra M. Riddiford L.M. Dev. Genes, Evol. 1996; 206: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), were dissolved in the medium just before use. N-terminal sequencing of a 23-kDa protein from the solubilized cocoons revealed a 14-amino acid sequence AFV(R?)VDDDNNSFPK. The identity of the fourth residue with Arg was doubtful, but the remaining sequence clearly showed that we were dealing with an unknown silk protein. An oligoprobe (A/G)TT (A/G)TT (A/G)TC (A/G)TC (A/G)TC IAC NC(G/T) IAC (G/T)AA NCG was designed on the basis of the first 10 amino acids and used to screen about 2 × 104 plaques of the silk gland-specific cDNA library prepared previously (14Z̆urovec M. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Kumaran A.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 55-67Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All three cDNA clones, which were isolated in the first screen, contained an open reading frame that included appropriate amino acid sequence. A cDNA insert of 356 base pairs was used to rescreen the library, and a nearly full-length cDNA clone was identified among 1.5 × 105plaques. The nucleotide sequence of this cDNA contained several ATG codons; however, only the translation product initiated at the first ATG included the desired amino acid sequence. The first ATG codon was also in proper position for translation initiation (an A at the critical −3-position and a G at the +4-position) (28Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar), and the 5′-flanking region was similar to the translational start site consensus identified in Drosophila (29Cavener D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The open reading frame initiated by the first in frame ATG consisted of 501 nt and ended with a TAA termination codon in nucleotide positions 564–566 (Fig. 1). A putative translation product of 167 amino acid residues apparently included a signal peptide of 17 residues, because amino acid sequence corresponding to the N terminus of the secreted 23-kDa silk protein began at residue 18. The amino acid arrangement around residues 17 and 18 complied with rules for signal peptide cleavage (30Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The sequence established by N-terminal sequencing of the 23-kDa silk protein differed from that of the deduced peptide in 2 of 14 amino acids. Since all analyzed cDNA clones encoded identical N terminus, the mismatches were obviously due to errors in peptide sequencing. To make sure that the identified cDNA corresponded to the 23-kDa protein, we repeated sequencing of 10 N-terminal amino acid residues. N-terminal sequences were also established for the adjacent 22.5-kDa protein and for other silk proteins discerned in the region between 15 and 23 kDa (Fig. 2, lanes 1and 2). The N termini of the 22.5- and 23-kDa proteins proved identical and matched the deduced seroin sequence except for tryptophan in the fourth position; it must be noted that tryptophan cannot be identified with the protein sequencing method that was used. The result demonstrates that seroin encodes two silk proteins of similar size. A mass of 16293.90 Da was calculated for the secreted seroin from the deduced sequence, in contrast to the apparent 22.5- and 23-kDa sizes of the silk proteins that both possessed the seroin N terminus. We noted, however, that the deduced seroin sequence contained two amino acid triplets, Asn-Asn-Ser at the N terminus and Asn-Glu-Thr at the C terminus (Fig. 1), which are known as potentialN-glycosylation sites (31Lehle L. Bause E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 799: 246-251Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Silk proteins were therefore probed with several lectins, and the presence of sugar moieties in both the 22.5- and the 23-kDa silk proteins was shown by their reaction with concanavalin A (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). Since it was possible that the silk included also a nonglycosylated form of seroin, we established N-terminal sequences of two silk proteins whose size was about 16 kDa. We found that these proteins possess identical N termini that are different from the seroin N terminus (TableI).Table ISequence of 11 N-terminal amino acids of low molecular silk proteins extracted from the cocoons of G. mellonella and B. moriSilk proteinGenusN-terminal protein sequenceOverlap%L-fibroinGalleriaG P A N N V V R P P RL-fibroinBombyxG P P S P I Y R P C Y36p25GalleriaS V V I S Q D N I N Np25BombyxS V T I N Q Y S N N E45Seroin (18 kDa)GalleriaG F V W V D D D N N SSeroin (13 kDa)BombyxG F V ?

Total RNA extracted from the silk glands and a synthetic 19-mer, complementary to the sequenceoverlined in Fig. 1, were used. A single extension product of 92 nt was obtained (Fig. 3 A), disclosing that 9 nt were lacking at the 5′-end of our cDNA and that seroin 5′-UTR includes 71 nt. The length of 3′-UTR was not established with certainty. The sequence of 612 nt, which follow after the termination codon, encompasses two consensus polyadenylation signals (32Keller W. Cell. 1996; 81: 829-832Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar) but no poly(A) tail. We assume, however, that the identified 3′-UTR is virtually complete, because the total length of the cDNA (1275 nt) matches the apparent size of seroin mRNA (1.2 kb). Genomic Southern hybridization with the seroin cDNA probe of 356 nt revealed a single band in all four DNA digests that were analyzed (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the haploidGalleria genome contains a single copy of theseroin gene. The 356-nt probe was employed to detect seroin mRNA in the Northern blots of total RNA that was extracted from the middle and posterior sections of silk glands, the muscles, and the fat body, respectively. The results showed that a single seroin transcript of about 1.2 nt was expressed abundantly in the MSG and, to a lesser extent, in the PSG, but not in the other tissues (Fig. 4). Also, no signal was detected in the Northern blots of total RNA prepared from larval carcasses deprived of the silk glands but containing all other organs (data not shown). These results invite the conclusion that expression of the seroin gene is confined to the silk-secreting regions of silk glands. The ratio of seroin mRNA in MSG versus PSG was similar in five randomly selected stages of the penultimate and last larval instars. Developmental changes in the relative content ofseroin mRNA in the whole silk glands were examined in the course of the penultimate and last larval instars. We found thatseroin mRNA accumulated in the feeding penultimate instar larvae and declined at molt to the last instar larvae (Fig. 5). A rapid postecdysial increase ofseroin mRNA content coincided with the resumption of feeding. Within 24 h of the last instar, the relative amount ofseroin mRNA reached a higher level than was the penultimate instar maximum. The onset of cocoon spinning at 120 h of the last instar was associated with another rise ofseroin mRNA to an absolute peak in mobile prepupae. Following cocoon completion, the silk glands turned fragile, and their milky appearance signified apoptosis. The content of seroinmRNA rapidly dropped to a barely detectable level. Insect development is known to be regulated by ecdysteroids and juvenile hormones (JH). Possible roles of these hormones in the control of seroin expression were examined by subjecting silk glands to aberrant hormonal situations. Silk glands develop in virtual absence of JH for most of the last larval instar (32Keller W. Cell. 1996; 81: 829-832Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and in our experiment we took advantage of this fact by challenging them with the JH analog W-328, which was administered to mobile prepupae. The untreated insects reached the stage of immobile prepupae within 24 h (point IP in the graph in Fig. 5), and the seroin mRNA became undetectable. The control insects, which were treated with acetone, appeared as immobile prepupae 36 h after the treatment, their silk glands showing signs of apoptosis and no detectable levels of seroin mRNA (Fig. 6, lane 4). By contrast, the silk glands of insects treated with JH analog retained their integrity for at least 70 h when the insects were sacrificed. Some of the treated insects were at the stage of immobile prepupa, whereas others had already ecdysed to pupae with slightly shortened wings and appendages, a typical JH effect. The silk glands of all of these animals contained considerable amounts of seroin mRNA (Fig. 6, lanes 1–3). The JH analog prevented silk gland degradation, which normally ensues after the pupal ecdysis and thus averted the termination of seroin gene transcription. Silk glands explanted from day 6 last instar larvae, the time when the content of seroin mRNA is rising (see Fig. 5) and the titer of ecdysteroids is low (33Rembold H. Sehnal F. Insect Biochem. 1987; 17: 997-1001Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), were used to test the effects of hormones in vitro. The addition of 20E to the culture medium, at a dose mimicking ecdysteroid concentration in the hemolymph of the pupating insects, caused a decrease of seroinmRNA (Fig. 6, lane 8 versus lanes 5 and 7). The decline was alleviated when the medium containing 20E was also supplied with juvenile hormone II (Fig. 6,lane 6). When the level of seroin mRNA in the total RNA of silk glands cultured in the presence of the solvent was taken as 100 ± 17%, the level measured in the 20E-treated medium amounted to 42 ± 11%. However, in the presence of cycloheximide and anisomycin, the content of the mRNA was reduced by 20E only to 70 ± 14 and 70 ± 9% of the control value, respectively. Since we suspected that the silk of B. mori might contain a seroin homolog, the N-terminal sequences of several small size components of the Bombyx cocoon silk were established in a similar way as in Galleria silk proteins. Eleven N-terminal amino acids identified in the 8- and 13-kDa Bombyx silk proteins were nearly identical to the N terminus of Galleria seroin (TableI). Interestingly, the residue in position 4 could not be read, similarly as with Galleria seroin. Despite this, the homology between Galleria seroin and the Bombyx8- and 13-kDa proteins is higher than between the L-fibroin and p25 counterparts in the two species (Table I). Structural characterization of individual silk components is a necessary prerequisite for elucidating their roles in the production, physical properties, chemical resistance, and biological functions of silk. In this paper, we describe the existence of a distinct class of small silk components, the seroins, that differ from the bulk of large size silk proteins structurally and in that their production occurs both in PSG, where fibroins are produced, and in MSG, where fibroin coating by sericins is provided. This dual origin is emphasized by the term “seroin.” The secreted (after the signal peptide removal) seroin peptide ofGalleria (Fig. 1) differs from all known silk proteins by its high proline content (34 residues or 20.26% by weight) and lack of cysteine. More than a half of the proline residues are contained in two copies of a PPLPQPPPL repeat and in three copies of a PPI motif. Acidic residues prevail over the basic ones, and the calculated pI of seroin therefore equals 4.93. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the silk proteins reveals that the seroin peptide is present in silk as 22.5- and 23-kDa glycoproteins. Their reaction with concanavalin A (Fig. 2,lanes 2 and 3) indicates the presence of mannose-rich carbohydrates. The nonglycosylated form of seroin, which would migrate as a 16-kDa protein, is not secreted. This situation is reminiscent of the p25 gene product that also occurs in the silk as two mannose-rich glycoproteins whose apparent size is, by 6–7 kDa, larger than the molecular mass of the deduced peptide. The relatively high content of polar amino acids and the glycosylation should make seroins water-soluble. However, washing silk with hot water did not reduce the content of the 22.5- and 23-kDa proteins (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 2). This observation suggests that seroins are liberated from the silk only when most of the silk components are dissolved. The function of seroin is elusive. Since the high proline content is reminiscent of the proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (23Boman H.G. Scand. J. Immunol. 1996; 43: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we suspect that seroin may be responsible for silk resistance to molds and bacteria. Our data indicate that there is one copy of the seroin gene present in the genome, similarly to other lepidopteran silk genes. As in other silk genes,seroin expression exhibits a high degree of spatial and temporal specificity. However, the simultaneous expression ofseroin in PSG and MSG is unique. Down-regulation of silk genes by ecdysteroids was previously illustrated in experiments with isolated abdomens of postfeedingGalleria larvae. The removal of the head and thorax deprived the insects of their source of ecdysteroids and most other hormones, but the abdomens survived and the silk glands remained functional for many weeks. The contents of sericin mRNAs (24Yang C. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 32: 353-362Crossref Google Scholar) andp25 mRNA3 declined gradually in such preparations, but application of a molt-inducing 20E dose elicited their rapid disappearance. These experiments could not reveal, however, if 20E acted directly on the silk glands or if the effect was mediated by some other tissues, for example the fat body that provides silk glands with nutrients. In the present study, we demonstrate that the content of seroin mRNA declines when explanted silk glands are exposed to 20E in the absence of any other tissue (Fig. 6). As expected, the decline is much lower in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors, indicating that the seroin gene is not the primary target of the hormone. The titer of ecdysteroids rises and the activity of silk glands is diminished during each ecdysis (1Sehnal F. Akai H. Int. J. Insect Morphol. Embryol. 1990; 19: 79-132Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 7Suzuki Y. Brown D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 63: 409-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we stated that considerable amounts of sericin mRNAs persist in the silk glands during larval ecdyses but become undetectable during the pupal ecdysis, when the silk glands initiate apoptosis (24Yang C. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 32: 353-362Crossref Google Scholar). Administration of a JH analog to larvae before pupal ecdysis prevents apoptosis, and the sericin mRNA remains present. We now show that JH exerts such a protective effect on the seroinmRNA in explanted silk glands in the absence of any other organ (Fig. 6). The results of our in vitro tests demonstrate that both ecdysteroids and JH act directly on the silk glands. An enhanced ecdysteroid concentration suppresses expression of theseroin and other silk genes, and in the absence of JH it elicits silk gland degeneration; the latter effect is prevented and silk gene expression is restored when exogenous JH or a JH analog is added.

https://openalex.org/W2028235694,"Dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI) is a cysteine protease found predominantly in myelomonocytic cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and mast cells. Recent studies identify an intracellular role for mast cell-DPPI (MC-DPPI) by activating prochymase and protryptase to their mature forms. To better define MC-DPPI and to explore the possibility of extracellular roles, we purified MC-DPPI from mastocytoma cells. We found the dog C2 mastocytoma cell line to be the richest source yet described for DPPI, purifying up to 200 μg of enzyme per g of cells. Dog MC-DPPI has an M r of ∼175,000 and consists of four subunits, each composed of a propeptide, light chain, and heavy chain. The heavy chain isN-glycosylated and is heterogeneously processed to three different forms. NH2-terminal sequences of the heavy chain and propeptide are identical to those predicted from a cDNA clone we sequenced from a mastocytoma cDNA library. The dog cDNA-derived sequence is 86% identical to that of human DPPI. Dog mastocytoma cells incubated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate increase expression of MC-DPPI mRNA. MC-DPPI maintains its activity for dipeptide substrates at a neutral to alkaline pH. Cells stimulated with ionophore or substance P secrete MC-DPPI in parallel with the granule-associated mediators tryptase and histamine. Thus, dog mastocytoma cells secrete DPPI that is active at the pH of extracellular fluids, suggesting that MC-DPPI may act outside the cell.

The C1 family of cysteine proteases includes the lysosomal proteases cathepsins B, C, H, S, and L. Initially, it was believed that these proteases function primarily or exclusively in intracellular protein degradation and turnover (1McDonald J.K. Schwabe C. Barret A.J. Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. North-Holland, Amsterdam1977: 311-391Google Scholar). This perspective has expanded as members of this group were found to play a role in antigen presentation (2Mizuochi T. Yee S.T. Kasai M. Kakiuchi T. Muno D. Kominami E. Immunol.

In addition, cathepsins B, L, and S can be secreted into the extracellular compartment and may play a part in extracellular matrix degradation and tumor metastasis (9Reddy V.Y. Zhang Q. Weiss S.J.

These observations suggest more diverse roles for this group of proteases.Dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI), 1The abbreviations used are: DPPI, dipeptidyl peptidase I; MC-DPPI, mast cell DPPI; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: DPPI, dipeptidyl peptidase I; MC-DPPI, mast cell DPPI; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid. also known as cathepsin C, is a unique member of the lysosomal group of cysteine proteases. DPPI differs from the other members in structure and substrate preferences. By unknown mechanisms, human DPPI is processed into a mature, proteolytically active enzyme consisting of theM r 23,000 heavy chain (amino acids 231–394), the M r 7000 light chain (amino acids 395–463), and an M r 16,000 propeptide that remains associated with the active enzyme. In contrast to the endoproteolytic activity of cathepsins B, S, and L, DPPI has relatively promiscuous exopeptidase activity, hydrolyzing most NH2-terminal dipeptides except those with P1 proline or P2 basic residues (12McDonald J.K.

By removing NH2-terminal dipeptides intracellularly, DPPI activates a number of granule-associated serine proteases, including lymphocyte granzymes, neutrophil elastase, and cathepsin G (5McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DPPI may play a role in cell growth (16Doughty M.J. Gruenstein E.I. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Thiele D.L. McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5200-5210PubMed Google Scholar) and in the activation of platelet factor XIII (18Lynth G.W. Pfeuller S.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 59: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and neuraminidase (19D'Agrosa R.M. Callahan J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Mast cells have granules that contain histamine, heparin, and serine proteases, such as tryptase and chymase (20Dvorak A.M. Kaliner M.A. Metcalfe D.D. The Mast Cell in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 1-90Google Scholar). Tryptase and chymase are synthesized as inactive zymogens and then are activated by removal of NH2-terminal dipeptides by DPPI (7Murakami M. Karnik S.S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2218-2223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These activated proteases are released by mast cells when stimulated to degranulate by various physiological stimuli (21Caughey G.H. Lazarus S.C. Viro N.F. Gold W.M. Nadel J.A. Immunology. 1988; 63: 344-399Google Scholar). Mast cell granules also contain and secrete lysosomal hydrolases, such as β-hexosaminidase (22Schwartz L.B. Lewis R.A. Seldin D. Austin K.F. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1290-1294PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, mast cell granules contain a diverse group of molecules, some of which reside in lysosomes in other types of cells, which can be secreted by exocytosis.We have initiated studies designed to improve our understanding of the intracellular and possible extracellular roles of mast cell DPPI (MC-DPPI). This work reports the purification and biochemical properties of MC-DPPI. We show that dog mast cells produce large amounts of MC-DPPI, which is active over a broad pH range. Unlike other reported DPPIs, MC-DPPI exhibits heterogeneous processing of its heavy chain, and a large fraction of the enzyme can be released from intracellular storage sites. We also found that the levels of MC-DPPI mRNA are subject to modulation. These studies of MC-DPPI show possibly novel processing, regulated expression, and extracellular activity.DISCUSSIONThis report describes the purification and characterization of DPPI from dog mastocytoma cells, which are the richest source of the enzyme yet described. Dog MC-DPPI is similar to human DPPI in oligomeric structure, activity at acidic pH, inhibition by inactivators of cysteine proteinases, and inducibility of mRNA expression (15McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,27Dolenc I. Turk B. Pungercic G. Ritonja A. Turk V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10260-10265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Possibly unique features are variable processing of its heavy chain, preservation of activity at a neutral to alkaline pH, and capacity for exocytic secretion. These features raise the possibility that MC-DPPI levels vary when mast cells are exposed to different external stimuli and that MC-DPPI enacts extracellular roles in addition to its previously described intracellular actions.The strategy we used to purify MC-DPPI is a modification of the techniques used to purify DPPI from other sources (15McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Dolenc I. Turk B. Pungercic G. Ritonja A. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21626-21631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The purification protocol takes advantage of the stability of MC-DPPI at acidic pH, N-glycosylation (resulting in binding to lentil lectin), and large size relative to other mast cell proteins. Using our purification scheme, we purified up to 200 μg of MC-DPPI per g of mastocytoma cells, as compared with 2 (27Dolenc I. Turk B. Pungercic G. Ritonja A. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21626-21631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and 1 (15McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) μg/g from human kidney and spleen, respectively. These results suggest the possibility that mast cells, because of their wide distribution, are the major source of DPPI in many tissues. From the specific activity determined for purified MC-DPPI, we estimate that C2 mastocytoma cells contain 1–2 pg of MC-DPPI per cell, an amount similar to that of chymase (23DeVinney R. Gold W.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 3: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), another major mast cell protease.As reported for human kidney DPPI (27Dolenc I. Turk B. Pungercic G. Ritonja A. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21626-21631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), purified MC-DPPI separates into three bands with M r values of ∼24,000, 16,000, and <10,000 on reducing SDS-PAGE. Resolution of the heavy chain into three smaller bands after N-deglycosylation shows that the heavy chain of MC-DPPI is N-glycosylated and is heterogeneously processed. Alternative splicing of mRNA does not explain the size differences because there is only one mRNA species noted on our RNA blots. Our data indicate that MC-DPPI has multiple heavy chain NH2 termini. The LPTSW … terminus is identical to that reported for human DPPI (27Dolenc I. Turk B. Pungercic G. Ritonja A. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21626-21631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); however, the ISRLP … RLPTS … and EE … NH2 termini are novel and appear to result from proteolysis at sites proximal to the LPTSW … sequence. Unlike the LPTSW … heavy chain terminus of human DPPI, our ISRLP … NH2 terminus is the predominant site of cleavage as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Alternative NH2-terminal processing does not fully explain theM r ∼1000 heterogeneity of the heavy chain. Therefore, variable COOH-terminal proteolytic processing and glycosylation, as well as other modifications, may contribute to the size difference.The propeptide and light chain of MC-DPPI are processed in a manner similar to those of human DPPI. Their estimatedM r and NH2-terminal sequences correspond exactly to those reported for human DPPI (27Dolenc I. Turk B. Pungercic G. Ritonja A. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21626-21631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Resolution of the propeptide doublet into a single band afterN-deglycosylation suggests that it isN-glycosylated. NH2-terminal sequencing of deglycosylated material reveals an Asp instead of the predicted Asn at the fifth residue of the propeptide. This is consistent with glycosylation of the first predicted glycosylation site because an Asp is generated by N-deglycosylation. The blank in the sixth cycle of the propeptide sequence results from oxidation of cysteine.There are several possible explanations for the variable NH2 termini identified of the MC-DPPI heavy chain. The ISRLP … NH2 terminus may result from processing by a granzyme B-like protease, and the LPTSW … NH2 terminus may result from cleavage by a tryptic-like protease (possibly tryptase). Alternatively, there may be only one major site of endoproteolytic cleavage of the proenzyme, with further exoproteolytic processing of the NH2 terminus by aminopeptidases or dipeptidyl peptidases, possibly MC-DPPI itself. An initial major endoproteolytic cleavage may generate the EEISRLPT … heavy chain isoform, which is then autoprocessed by MC-DPPI itself, yielding the ISRLPT … and RLPTS … NH2 termini, or processed by tryptase, yielding the LPTSW … NH2-terminal isoform identified by Edman degradation. Processive hydrolysis by mast cell monoaminopeptidase cleavage (33Serafin W.E. Guidry U.A. Dayton E.T. Kamada M.M. Stevens R.L. Austen F.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5984-5988Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) of the EEISRLP … NH2terminus could explain some or all of the subsequent NH2termini identified; however, one might have expected to detect EISRL … and SRLPT … NH2 termini if aminopeptidase processing had occurred exclusively.The functional significance of variable heavy chain processing is unknown. It is possible that differences in processing affect substrate specificity, pH optimum, and specific activity. Identification of the proteases involved in MC-DPPI processing and the sites of such processing (endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, secretory granules, or cell extracts) require future study.As seen in Fig. 3, much of dog MC-DPPI is conserved in DPPIs of other species. The most conserved region of DPPI is the heavy chain, suggesting that many heavy chain residues, and the heavy chain itself, are critical for enzyme activity and specificity. Conservation of the catalytic amino acids Cys234 and His381, as well as two amino acids, Gln228 and Trp399, which are believed to be important for stabilizing the catalytic dyad and its intermediates (31Storer A.C. Menard R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 486-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), suggests that the deduced amino acid sequence is that of catalytically active MC-DPPI. Specific residues critical for determining exopeptidase activity of MC-DPPI have yet to be determined.The function of the propeptide of MC-DPPI specifically and of DPPIs in general is unknown. The propeptides of cathepsin B and cathepsin L, two of the nearest relatives of DPPI, inhibit enzymatic activity by binding to the substrate binding cleft (34Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Turk V. Turk D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 774-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 35Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Following a proteolytic event, the propeptide is released, and the enzyme is thereby activated. This scenario probably differs for MC-DPPI because the propeptide is 2–3 times longer than that of cathepsins B and L, and a portion of its propeptide remains associated with the active enzyme. The propeptide of MC-DPPI may initially function similarly to that of cathepsins B and L by occupying the MC-DPPI active site and inhibiting catalytic activity. A COOH-terminal portion of the propeptide may then be removed by proteolysis, leaving a smaller fragment of the propeptide associated with the active enzyme. Alternatively, the propeptide may confer a specific conformation to MC-DPPI, which then changes after removal of the propeptide fragment. The remaining portion of the propeptide is probably disulfide-linked to the mature enzyme, as suggested by the lack of a propeptide fragment on nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Although the function of the portion of propeptide that remains linked with the active enzyme is unknown, it may help to maintain structural stability or influence the catalytic attributes of the protease. Alternatively, it may be a functionless remnant, as suggested for the portion of the chymotrypsin propeptide that remains disulfide-linked to the mature active enzyme (36Birktoft J.J. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 68: 187-240Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar).Finding that MC-DPPI has activity over a broad pH range from 6.0 to 7.5 is important for several reasons. MC-DPPI activates the mast cell proteases tryptase and chymase by removing an NH2-terminal dipeptide (7Murakami M. Karnik S.S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2218-2223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This activation likely occurs either in the Golgi apparatus or in secretory granules, which are acidic organelles (pH 5.5–6.5) (37Johnson R.G. Carty S.E. Fingerhood B.J. Scarpa A. FEBS Lett. 1980; 120: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, to remove the dipeptide, MC-DPPI must be active at an acidic pH. Proteolytic activity at a neutral to alkaline pH is significant because we showed that MC-DPPI can be released by degranulating mast cells. Activity at neutral to alkaline pH raises the possibility of extracellular roles following release.In this report, we showed that MC-DPPI is secreted by cultured mast cells in parallel with tryptase and histamine. This observation indicates that MC-DPPI is functionally, and possibly physically, in the same compartment as the classic mast cell secretory products tryptase and histamine. Finding DPPI, a lysosomal protease, in mast cell secretory granules is not surprising because other lysosomal enzymes, such as β-hexosaminidase, also reside in these granules (22Schwartz L.B. Lewis R.A. Seldin D. Austin K.F. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1290-1294PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that DPPI and tryptase activity coexist in a cytoplasmic granular fraction in extracts of mouse mastocytoma cells further supports the possible colocalization of DPPI and tryptase (5McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Secretion of MC-DPPI by cells stimulated with substance P is significant because it identifies a physiological stimulus whereby MC-DPPI may be released extracellularly. Mast cells have been found in close association with nerve terminals of neurons from the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nervous system, including those that store substance P (38Arizono N. Matusda S. Hattori T. Kojima Y. Maeda T. Galli S.J. Lab. Invest. 1990; 62: 626-634PubMed Google Scholar, 39Stead R.H. Tomioka M. Quinonez G. Simon G.T. Felten S.Y. Bienenstock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2975-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Depolarization of these neurons may result in release of substance P, which may then act on the nearby mast cell, stimulating secretion of MC-DPPI.The role of extracellular MC-DPPI is unknown at this time. Individually or in cooperation with other proteases, MC-DPPI may degrade targets such as neuropeptides, cytokines, or extracellular matrix proteins. In doing so, MC-DPPI may influence cellular functions or matrix remodeling. These effects would probably be limited to the local region around the mast cell because circulating protease inhibitors, such as the cystatins (40Barrett A.J. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1986; 45: 1367-1374Google Scholar), should inhibit MC-DPPI as it diffuses away from the cell. However, high concentrations of MC-DPPI in the immediate vicinity of the degranulating mast cell may overwhelm inhibitor defenses temporarily, allowing MC-DPPI to encounter and hydrolyze extracellular substrates.The polyclonal antibody raised against dog MC-DPPI recognizes predominantly the heavy chain of MC-DPPI, and not the propeptide or light chain, although each of these components is present in the purified material used to immunize rabbits. A possible explanation for this observation is that dog MC-DPPI propeptide and light chain are more homologous to the corresponding fragments of rabbit DPPI than is the heavy chain.The steady-state quantity of MC-DPPI mRNA and corresponding protein levels rise in cells incubated with phorbol ester. This suggests that MC-DPPI protein expression may be controlled by varying the amount mRNA via transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms. Regulation of MC-DPPI has several implications. First, quantities of enzyme may vary depending on the tissue location of the mast cell. An example of this is the variable expression of tryptase and chymase depending on whether the mast cell is of skin or mucosal origin (20Dvorak A.M. Kaliner M.A. Metcalfe D.D. The Mast Cell in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 1-90Google Scholar). Second, MC-DPPI may be the rate-limiting step in production of active tryptase and chymase because the amount of active tryptase or chymase will depend on availability of active MC-DPPI. Third, MC-DPPI may be regulated by inflammatory mediators. Mast cells have a role in allergic and inflammatory diseases, such as asthma (41Shimizu Y. Schwartz L.B. Barnes P.J. Grunstein M.M. Leff A.R. Woolcock A.J. Asthma. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1997: 353-365Google Scholar). Inflammatory mediators in these diseases may alter quantities of MC-DPPI and influence its roles in these diseases. The finding that c-kit ligand, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β do not alter MC-DPPI mRNA levels suggests that MC-DPPI may not be subject to regulation by these cytokines.In conclusion, dog mastocytoma cells produce a DPPI that has structural and enzymatic similarities to and differences from DPPIs purified from other tissues and species. Unique features of MC-DPPI are the heterogeneous processing of its heavy chain, enzymatic activity over a broad pH range, and secretion by mast cells. These findings invoke the possibility that MC-DPPI acts on extracellular targets. The C1 family of cysteine proteases includes the lysosomal proteases cathepsins B, C, H, S, and L. Initially, it was believed that these proteases function primarily or exclusively in intracellular protein degradation and turnover (1McDonald J.K. Schwabe C. Barret A.J. Proteinases in Mammalian Cells and Tissues. North-Holland, Amsterdam1977: 311-391Google Scholar). This perspective has expanded as members of this group were found to play a role in antigen presentation (2Mizuochi T. Yee S.T. Kasai M. Kakiuchi T. Muno D. Kominami E. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 43: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and protease activation (4Rowan A.D. Mason P. Mach L. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 267: 15993-15999Google Scholar, 5McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dikov M.M. Springman E.B. Yeola S.

Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, cathepsins B, L, and S can be secreted into the extracellular compartment and may play a part in extracellular matrix degradation and tumor metastasis (9Reddy V.Y. Zhang Q. Weiss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 3849-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 10Ulbricht B. Hagmann W. Ebert W. Speiss E. Exp.

These observations suggest more diverse roles for this group of proteases. Dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI), 1The abbreviations used are: DPPI, dipeptidyl peptidase I; MC-DPPI, mast cell DPPI; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: DPPI, dipeptidyl peptidase I; MC-DPPI, mast cell DPPI; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid. also known as cathepsin C, is a unique member of the lysosomal group of cysteine proteases. DPPI differs from the other members in structure and substrate preferences. By unknown mechanisms, human DPPI is processed into a mature, proteolytically active enzyme consisting of theM r 23,000 heavy chain (amino acids 231–394), the M r 7000 light chain (amino acids 395–463), and an M r 16,000 propeptide that remains associated with the active enzyme. In contrast to the endoproteolytic activity of cathepsins B, S, and L, DPPI has relatively promiscuous exopeptidase activity, hydrolyzing most NH2-terminal dipeptides except those with P1 proline or P2 basic residues (12McDonald J.K. Zeitman B.B. Reilly T.J. Ellis S. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2693-2709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13McDonald J.K. Ellis S. Reilly T.J. J. Biol.

Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). By removing NH2-terminal dipeptides intracellularly, DPPI activates a number of granule-associated serine proteases, including lymphocyte granzymes, neutrophil elastase, and cathepsin G (5McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, DPPI may play a role in cell growth (16Doughty M.J. Gruenstein E.I. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1987; 65: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17Thiele D.L. McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5200-5210PubMed Google Scholar) and in the activation of platelet factor XIII (18Lynth G.W. Pfeuller S.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 59: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and neuraminidase (19D'Agrosa R.M. Callahan J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mast cells have granules that contain histamine, heparin, and serine proteases, such as tryptase and chymase (20Dvorak A.M. Kaliner M.A. Metcalfe D.D. The Mast Cell in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 1-90Google Scholar). Tryptase and chymase are synthesized as inactive zymogens and then are activated by removal of NH2-terminal dipeptides by DPPI (7Murakami M. Karnik S.S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2218-2223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Sakai K. Ren S. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 988-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These activated proteases are released by mast cells when stimulated to degranulate by various physiological stimuli (21Caughey G.H. Lazarus S.C. Viro N.F. Gold W.M. Nadel J.A. Immunology. 1988; 63: 344-399Google Scholar). Mast cell granules also contain and secrete lysosomal hydrolases, such as β-hexosaminidase (22Schwartz L.B. Lewis R.A. Seldin D. Austin K.F. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 1290-1294PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, mast cell granules contain a diverse group of molecules, some of which reside in lysosomes in other types of cells, which can be secreted by exocytosis. We have initiated studies designed to improve our understanding of the intracellular and possible extracellular roles of mast cell DPPI (MC-DPPI). This work reports the purification and biochemical properties of MC-DPPI. We show that dog mast cells produce large amounts of MC-DPPI, which is active over a broad pH range. Unlike other reported DPPIs, MC-DPPI exhibits heterogeneous processing of its heavy chain, and a large fraction of the enzyme can be released from intracellular storage sites. We also found that the levels of MC-DPPI mRNA"

A major mechanism for the development of MDR phenotype is overexpression of P-glycoproteins which are encoded by theMDR gene family (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ling V. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: S3-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar and 2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Ambudka S.V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The MDR gene family contains two members in humans and three in rodents. However, only one human (MDR1) and two rodent (mdr1a and mdr1b) mdr genes are functionally related to the MDR phenotype. High mdr mRNA levels are seen in certain tumor types before chemotherapy and, in some cases, are associated with relapse following chemotherapy (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ling V. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: S3-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar and 3Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar). Increased mdr gene expression occurs in cultured cells selected by continuous exposure to both anticancer drugs and other cytotoxic agents, in which gene amplification is believed to be often associated with the overexpression of mdr genes (4Riordan J.R.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar), etc. is also able to activate mdrexpression, indicating that increased mdr expression is mediated by complex mechanisms. The precise mechanisms of the induction of mdr gene expression by anticancer drugs, chemical carcinogens, UV, and other DNA-damaging agents remain unknown. It has been suggested that both post-transcriptional and transcriptional mechanisms are involved (7Chin K-V. Chauhan S.S. Pastan I. Gottesman S.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 361-365PubMed Google Scholar). A possible role for the cytoskeleton in post-transcriptional stabilization of mdr1 mRNA in rat hepatocytes treated with certain agents was suggested (21Lee C.H. Bradley G. Ling V. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 347-354PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, in rat liver cells, it was found that doxorubicin-mediated mdr1 mRNA induction was fully inhibited by actinomycin D, suggesting that transcriptional regulation is involved (10Fardel O. Lecureur V. Daval S. Corlu A. Guillouzo A. Eur. J. Bochem. 1997; 246: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nuclear run-off and transfection analyses showed that AAF-, methylcholanthrene-, aflatoxin B1-, methyl methanesulfonate-, or mitoxantrone-induced mdr1expression is also associated with increased rates of transcription (9Schrenk D.

Further analysis demonstrates that a bona fide p53-binding site (5′-GAACATGTAGAGACATGTCT-3′) located within bp −199 to −180 of rat mdr1b promoter is essential for not only basal but also daunorubicin-inducible promoter functions. We also provide evidence indicating that both the promoter activity and endogenous expression of the rat mdr1b could be modulated by wild-type p53. Although the modulation of mdr expression by either mutant or wild-type p53 has been noted, no p53-binding sites have been identified previously (22Chin K-V. Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M.

The present report represents the first evidence that a specific p53-binding site is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the mdr gene. Since p53 is responsive to a variety of genotoxic stresses (for reviews, see Refs. 28Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar and 29Levine A.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15174-15183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). −214 RMICAT, −214 RMICAT-m1, and −214 RMICAT-m2 were constructed by a PCR method using −1288 RMICAT as the template and 5′-TCCATTTTAGCTTCCTTAG-3′ as the 3′ primer in combination with each of the following 5′ primers: 1) 5′-GGGGGTACCATATGGAGAGTTACCTGAAC; 2) 5′-GGGGTACCATATGGAGAGTTACCTGAATCGGTAGAGACATGTCTGT; 3) 5′-GGGGGTACCATATGGAGAGTTACCTGACATGTAGAGAACCGTCTGTGTTAATG. All three 5′ primers contained a KpnI site (underlined). The PCR products were digested with KpnI and XbaI and inserted into the KpnI/XbaI sites of a CAT vector (18Teeter L.D. Chan J.Y. Kuo M.T. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The −214/−126 thymidine kinase (tk)-CAT recombinant was constructed by a PCR method using p5.4GEM (30Zhou G. Song R. Kuo M.T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1369-1381PubMed Google Scholar) as the template, 5′-ACCAAGCTTATGGAGAGTTACCTGAACATGTAGAGACATGTCTGTG as the 5′-primer, and 5′-TGGGATCCAGGCTTCTCT-3′ as the 3′-primer. The PCR products were digested at HindIII andBamHI sites (underlined) in the primer sequences, and inserted into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pBLCAT2 (32Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The −214/−177 tk-CAT recombinant and its mutants were constructed by the insertion of each pair of the following phosphorylated and annealed oligonucleotides into theHindIII and BamHI site of pBLCAT2: Pair 1, 5′-AGCTTATGGAGAGTTACCTGAACATGTAGAGACATGTCTGTG and 5′-GATCCACAGACATGTCTCTACATGTTCAGGTAACTCTCCATA; Pair 2, 5′-AGCTTATGGAGAGTTACCTGAATCGGTAGAGACATGTCTGTG and 5′-GATCCACAGACATGTCTCTACCGATTCAGGTAACTCTCCATA; Pair 3, 5′-AGCTTATGGAGAGTTACCTGAACATGTAGAGAACCGTCTGTG and 5′-GATCCACAGACGGTTCTCTACATGTTCAGGTAACTCTCCATA. The resultant constructs were designated −214/−177 tk-CAT, −214/−177 tk-CAT-m1, and −214/−177 tk-CAT-m2, respectively. The sequences of all the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The rat hepatoma H-4-II-E cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 1548). Human osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells, low-passage rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs), A1-5 cells, and T101-4 cells were generously provided by Dr. G. Lozano. All the cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm glutamine, and 50 μg of neomycin/ml in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Prior to treatment, cells were grown in the medium to 70–80% confluence. Then cells were treated with daunorubicin (7 μg/ml) for various periods of time and harvested for the preparation of nuclear extracts and RNA. The calcium phosphate precipitation method (33Gorman C.M. Padmanabhan R. Howard B.H. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) was used to transfect cells with DNA. In brief, 2 h before transfection, cells in the exponential growth phase (approximately 70–80% confluence) were plated in Corning six-well plates. DNA-CaPO4 precipitate was added to the medium and incubated for 5–6 h. After cells were shocked with 15% glycerol for 30 s, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Stable transfectant A1–5 and H-4-II-E cells were established by co-transfecting the cells with the reporter constructs and pcDNA3 (Introgen, Carlsbad, CA) at 5:1 ratio followed by selection with G418 (400 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). Pools of G418-resistant cells were collected and used for further analysis. In transient transfection assays, cells were directly treated with daunorubicin (7 μg/ml) 24 h after transfection. After 20–24 h of drug exposure, cells were harvested. CAT activities in the cell extracts were measured by a previously described method (34Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar) using total protein extract (measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit) as a reference. Relative CAT activity levels were calculated by a PhosphorImager (model 400S, Molecular Dynamics) in terms of the conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol into acetylated chloramphenicol. Nuclear extracts were prepared from H-4-II-E cells by the method of Digman et al. (35Digman J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar) with modifications as described previously (31Zhou G. Kuo M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15174-15183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). GMSAs were performed with approximately 5 μg of nuclear proteins in a total volume of 20 μl of binding mixture containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and radiolabeled DNA probe at room temperature for 20 min. A 162-nucleotide antisense RNA probe (−37 to +125) was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (30Zhou G. Song R. Kuo M.T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1369-1381PubMed Google Scholar). Of total RNA from cells, either 20 μg (for themdr1b probe) or 1 μg (for the 18 S rRNA probe) was hybridized with 32P-labeled antisense RNA probes (2 × 105 cpm) and subjected to RNase protection assays as described previously (17Teeter L.D. Becker F.F. Chisari F.V. Li D. Kuo M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 11: 5728-5735Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Zhou G. Song R. Kuo M.T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1369-1381PubMed Google Scholar). The protected RNA products were analyzed on a 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantified using a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics). Two micrograms of total RNA isolated from H-4-II-E cells was used for reverse transcriptase reaction. On completion of the reverse transcriptase reaction, the enzyme was inactivated by heating to 94 °C for 56 min. Ten picomoles of each 5′ primer (5′-CCTGAAGACTGGATAACTGTCATGGAGGAT) and 3′ primer (5′-AGAGGGGGCCGAGTACTATCTACAAGGTAA) were used in a PCR to amplify rat p53 cDNA (30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 45 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C). PCR products were electrophoresed on an agarose gel, purified, and subjected to automated sequencing (ABI PRISM). To investigate whether the expression of the ratmdr1b gene expression is regulated by the anticancer drug daunorubicin, we treated rat hepatoma H-4-II-E cells with daunorubicin (7 μg/ml). At various time intervals, cells were harvested andmdr1b mRNA levels were measured by the RNase protection assay. As shown in Fig. 1, the steady-state mdr1b mRNA levels in these cells were elevated after exposure to daunorubicin for 12 and 24 h. Increases of about 3–5-fold were seen in three independent experiments. Similar results were obtained in cells treated with adriamycin and chemical carcinogen 2-AAAF (data not shown). These results demonstrated that ratmdr1b expression can be induced by these cytotoxic agents in rodent cells. To investigate the possible involvement of transcriptional regulation in the induction of the rat mdr1b gene expression by daunorubicin and, if so, to identify DNA sequences responsible for the daunorubicin induction of mdr1b expression, we generated a set of 5′ deletion mutant CAT constructs and transfected them into H-4-II-E cells following treatment with or without daunorubicin. When −1288 RMICAT, −243 RMICAT, and −214 RMICAT reporter constructs containing 1288, 243, and 214 bp of the rat mdr1b upstream sequences, respectively, plus 125 bp downstream from the transcription start site, were transiently transfected into H-4-II-E cells, CAT activities increased an approximately 1.6–1.9-fold in daunorubicin treated versus untreated cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). However, when −163 RMICAT, which contains additional deletion to −163 bp was transfected, basal transcriptional activities were reduced more than 80%. More importantly, the deletion also abolished daunorubicin inducibility (Fig. 2). Together, these results indicated that the ratmdr1b promoter can respond to daunorubicin treatment and that the sequence from bp −214 to −163 is essential for the promoter's daunorubicin responsiveness. We previously identified a NF-κB-binding site (bp −167 to −158) involved in basal and insulin-induced promoter function (31Zhou G. Kuo M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15174-15183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Since it was reported that daunorubicin can induce the NF-κB activity in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells and HL-60 promyelocytes (36Boland M.P. Foster S.J. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12952-12960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 37Wang C-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar), it is possible that NF-κB was also responsible for the inducible promoter activity of the rat mdr1b by daunorubicin in the H-4-II-E cells. To test this possibility, we transfected −243 RMICAT-κm, in which the NF-κB-binding site was mutated (31Zhou G. Kuo M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15174-15183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), into H-4-II-E cells following daunorubicin treatment. As shown in Fig. 2, although basal activity was reduced when compared with the wild-type −243 RMICAT, −243 RMICAT-κm still retained daunorubicin responsiveness. Besides, we did not observe an obvious increase of NF-κB binding activity after daunorubicin treatment using GMSAs (data not shown). These results suggested that NF-κB may not be directly involved in the daunorubicin-inducible promoter function of the rat mdr1b in H-4-II-E cells. To further substantiate the above observations, we generated two additional constructs by inserting sequences from bp −214 to −127 (containing NF-κB site) or −214 to −177 (containing no NF-κB site), respectively, into a pBLCAT2 vector containing the tk basal promoter and a CAT reporter gene. These constructs were then transiently transfected into H-4-II-E cells, and CAT expression was measured. As shown in Fig. 3, both constructs are capable of responding to daunorubicin treatment, giving rise to comparable levels of induction, whereas daunorubicin did not have effects on the tk promoter. These results suggested that NF-κB site is dispensable for the inducibility of mdr1bpromoter, and that the sequence from bp −214 to −177 may contain important cis-acting elements responsible for the induction of mdr1b promoter activity by daunorubicin. To test whether daunorubicin treatment could induce protein DNA binding at sequences within bp −214 to −177, we prepared nuclear extracts from H-4-II-E cells treated with or without daunorubicin and performed GMSAs. As shown in Fig. 4 A, a major DNA-protein complex was formed in the daunorubicin-untreated nuclear extracts when a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning bp −214 to −177 was used as the probe (lane 1, C1). The binding activity of this complex remained largely unchanged after daunorubicin treatment (lanes 2–5 versus lane 1). However, a slow migrating protein-DNA complex was induced 1 h after treatment (C2, lane 2). The binding activity of this induced complex remained elevated but gradually reduced throughout the 12-h induction period (lanes 2–5). To further characterize the sequence specificity of this daunorubicin-induced DNA binding activity, double-stranded oligonucleotides covering the left and right regions of bp −214 to −177 (fragments A and B, Fig. 4 C) were used in competition GMSA. Fig. 4 B shows that both the unlabeled probe (lane 2) and fragment B (bp −201 to −177) (lane 4) could compete for daunorubicin-induced DNA-protein complex, indicating that the induced protein binding required the sequence residing within fragment B. To further define the binding sequence of the induced protein complex, two site-directed mutant oligonucleotides (M1 and M2) containing mutations on 5′- or 3′-end of fragment B, respectively (Fig. 4 C), were used as competitors. However, neither mutated oligonucleotides could compete for daunorubicin-induced DNA-protein complex (Fig. 4 B,lanes 5–6), suggesting that the daunorubicin-induced protein binding required both the 5′- and 3′-sequences of fragment B (bp −201 to −177). In examining the DNA sequence of bp −201 to −177 (fragment B), we found within it a sequence (bp −199 to −180) strikingly similar to the p53-binding consensus sequence 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′ (38El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar), with only 2 base pair mismatches. A comparison of the putative mdr1bp53-binding site with the p53 consensus sequence and the p53-binding site from the gadd45 third intron (39Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 5 B. To determine whether the sequence located between bp −199 and −180 was indeed a p53-binding site, we carried out GMSAs using a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning bp −214 to −177 as the probe and nuclear extracts prepared from daunorubicin-treated H-4-II-E cells in the presence of various unlabeled oligonucleotides as competitors. As shown in Fig. 5 A, daunorubicin-induced DNA-protein complex was efficiently competed only by the gadd45 p53-binding sequences (lane 2), but not by the mutated gadd45p53-binding sequence (lane 3) and other unrelated sequences,i.e. AP-1 (40Xanthopoulos K.G. Prezioso V.R. Chen W.S. Sladek F.S. Cortese R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and NF-κB (41Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar) (lanes 4and5). Instead, the protein binding activity was actually enhanced by these unrelated oligonucleotides (compare lanes 3–5 to lane 1). The exact reasons for the enhanced binding activities are not clear at the present. To further strengthen this observation, antibodies were used in GMSAs. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the daunorubicin-induced protein-DNA complex was supershifed by p53 antibody PAb421 (lane 6), whereas c-Jun and NF-κB p65 antibodies did not affect the formation of induced DNA-protein complexes (lanes 7–8). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that the ratmdr1b promoter sequence located between bp −199 and −180 (5′-GAACATGTAGAGACATGTCT-3′) is a p53-binding site. To determine whether the rat p53 in H-4-II-E cells is a wild-type or mutant form, we amplified cDNA copies of the rat p53 by reverse transcriptase-PCR and sequenced it directly (see “Materials and Methods”). The result showed that H-4-II-E cells has a wild-type rat p53 mRNA (data not shown) with a sequence consistent with that published previously (42Soussi T. Caron de Fromentel C. Breugnot C. May E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11384-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To characterize the functional role of the identified p53-binding site, the same mutations in Fig. 4 Cwere introduced within the context of the wild-type −214 RMICAT construct, and resultant recombinants were designated −214 RMICAT-m1 and −214 RMICAT-m2. These mutant constructs were then transfected into H-II-4-E cells following treatment with or without daunorubicin. As shown in Fig. 6 A, both mutations abolished the daunorubicin responsiveness. Similar results were obtained when the same mutations were introduced into heterologous (tk) promoter constructs (Fig. 6 B). These results suggested that the integrity of p53 binding is essential for the daunorubicin inducible-promoter function of the ratmdr1b. It has been reported that promoters containing p53-binding sites, in some cases, essentially showed no obvious DNA damage responsiveness in transient transfection assays after the treatment of UV or other DNA-damaging agents, whereas higher levels of the induction of the same reporters were seen in stable transfectants (43Zhan Q. Carrier F. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4242-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observed only low levels of inductions of mdr1b CAT activities by daunorubicin were observed in our transient transfection assays (Figs. 2, 3, 6, A and B). To test whether the rat mdr1b promoter can respond to daunorubicin more dramatically in stable transfectants than in transient transfected cells, we stably transfected both −214 RMICAT and −214 RMICAT-m1 into H-4-II-E cells. As expected, wild-type CAT reporter (−214 RMICAT) exhibited more significant responsiveness to daunorubicin (4-fold, Fig. 6 C), which is comparable with the induction levels ofmdr1b mRNA by daunorubicin (Fig. 1). As a control, −214 RMICAT-m1 in stably transfected H-4-II-E cells failed to respond to daunorubicin (Fig. 6 C). These results further strengthened the notion that the p53-binding site is required for the promoter's daunorubicin responsiveness. Why the fold induction is different between transient and stable transfectants is unclear but could be due to the participation of chromatin proteins or structure in p53-mediated gene expression, since studies have indicated that transiently transfected DNA, unlike stably transfected templates, are not efficiently packed into chromatin (44Pazin M.J. Kadonago J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, a recent report showed that high mobility group protein-1, an important component of chromatin, is a coactivator of p53 (45Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.C. Murthy K.G.K. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes & Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To investigate whether p53 is able to regulate ratmdr1b promoter function, A1–5 cells, which were derived from primary REFs transformed by a p53 temperature-sensitive mutant p53Val-135 (46Martinez J. Grorgoff I. Martinez J. Levine A.J. Gene & Dev. 1991; 5: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), were stably transfected with reporter constructs containing either a wild-type p53-binding site (−214 RMICAT) or a mutated p53 site (−214 RMICAT-m1). As expected, when stably transfected A1–5 cells were shifted from the"

Activation of the oxidase is consequent to the assembly of a membrane-localized multimolecular complex consisting of cytochrome b 559 and the cytosolic components. We used “peptide walking” (Joseph, G., and Pick, E. (1995)J. Biol.

Four of these domains (c, d, e, and g) correspond to or form parts of regions shown before to participate in NADPH oxidase assembly. Thus, domain c corresponds to a region on the N-terminal boundary of the first src homology 3 (SH3) domain, whereas domains d and e represent more precisely defined sites within the full-length first and second SH3 domains, respectively. Domain g overlaps an extensively investigated arginine-rich region. Domains a and b, in the N-terminal half of p47phox, and domains f and h, in the C-terminal half, represent newly identified entities, for which there is no earlier experimental evidence of involvement in NADPH oxidase activation. “Peptide walking” was also applied to the identification of domains in p47phox mediating binding to p67phox. This was done by quantifying, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the binding of p67phox, in solution, to a series of 95 overlapping biotinylated p47phox peptides, attached to streptavidin-coated 96-well plates. A single proline-rich domain (residues 357–371) was found to bind p67phox in the absence and presence of lithium dodecyl sulfate. The superoxide generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes consists, in resting cells, of a membrane-associated electron transporting flavocytochrome (cytochromeb 559) and four cytosolic proteins as follows: p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase, Rac(1 or 2).

Four of these domains (c, d, e, and g) correspond to or form parts of regions shown before to participate in NADPH oxidase assembly. Thus, domain c corresponds to a region on the N-terminal boundary of the first src homology 3 (SH3) domain, whereas domains d and e represent more precisely defined sites within the full-length first and second SH3 domains, respectively. Domain g overlaps an extensively investigated arginine-rich region. Domains a and b, in the N-terminal half of p47phox, and domains f and h, in the C-terminal half, represent newly identified entities, for which there is no earlier experimental evidence of involvement in NADPH oxidase activation. “Peptide walking” was also applied to the identification of domains in p47phox mediating binding to p67phox. This was done by quantifying, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the binding of p67phox, in solution, to a series of 95 overlapping biotinylated p47phox peptides, attached to streptavidin-coated 96-well plates. A single proline-rich domain (residues 357–371) was found to bind p67phox in the absence and presence of lithium dodecyl sulfate. Phagocytic cells produce, in response to appropriate stimuli, a variety of oxygen-derived toxic radicals, all of which are derived from superoxide (O·̄2). 1The abbreviations used are: O·̄2, superoxide; Tween 20, polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate; LiDS, lithium dodecyl sulfate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SH3, src homology 3; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: O·̄2, superoxide; Tween 20, polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate; LiDS, lithium dodecyl sulfate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SH3, src homology 3; BSA, bovine serum albumin.O·̄2 is generated by the NADPH-derived one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, catalyzed by a membrane-associated heterodimeric flavocytochrome (cytochrome b 559), composed of a 91-kDa glycoprotein (gp91phox) and a 22-kDa protein (p22phox), and incorporating two redox centers, FAD and two hemes (reviewed in Refs. 1Thrasher A.J.

The conversion of cytochromeb 559 from the resting to the activated state is, most likely, the result of a conformational change leading to a high turnover electron flow from NADPH to oxygen, through the redox centers. This change in conformation is brought about by protein-protein interactions involving the two cytochrome b 559subunits and four cytosolic regulatory proteins, p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase Rac(1 or 2) (reviewed in Refs. 4McPhail L.C.

It is commonly assumed that activation leads to the formation of a membrane-localized multimolecular structure, known as the NADPH oxidase complex. The physical expression of this, in the intact cell, is the translocation of parts of p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane (6Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) associated with the phosphorylation of p47phox at multiple sites (7Hayakawa T. Suzuki K. Suzuki S. Andrews P.C. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9109-9115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the activation of NADPH oxidase involves translocation of p40phox and Rac to the membrane is as yet an unsettled question.The conversion of cytochrome b 559 from the inactive to the active conformation can be achieved in vitroin a cell-free system, consisting, in its most elementary form, of membranes and cytosol from resting cells exposed to a critical concentration of certain fatty acids (8Bromberg Y.

An advanced version of the cell-free system, consisting of solubilized membrane or purified and lipid-reconstituted cytochromeb 559 combined with purified recombinant cytosolic components (13Rotrosen D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), served as a valuable tool for the analysis of intermolecular interactions in the assembly of NADPH oxidase. p47phox plays a pivotal role in the activation of NADPH oxidase, so far it is the only cytosolic component for which unequivocal evidence is available for physical binding to cytochromeb 559 (reviewed in Ref. 4McPhail L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).A number of methodologies have been utilized in the past for the detection of protein-protein interactions between p47phox and other NADPH oxidase components and for the identification of domains in the amino acid sequence of p47phox essential for its participation in the assembly of the complex (reviewed in Ref. 5De Leo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We recently described a new approach to mapping functionally significant domains in proteins, based on the use of overlapping peptides spanning the complete sequence of the protein under scrutiny. This methodology, termed “peptide walking,” was applied to the analysis of Rac1 domains involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase (15Joseph G. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29079-29082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present paper we applied peptide walking to the analysis of p47phox domains involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase. This research had two goals as follows: 1) evaluate the reliability of the method by its ability to detect domains identified before by other approaches, and 2) assess the capacity of the method to identify previously unknown domains. Finally, peptide walking was used as a method to identify domains in p47phox participating in interaction with p67phox.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and ReagentsSynthetic PeptidesNinety-five overlapping pentadecapeptides spanning the complete p47phox amino acid sequence, from the N to the C terminus, were synthesized by the multipin synthesis method (16Valerio R.M. Benstead M. Bray A.M. Campbell R.A. Maeji N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) by Chiron Mimotopes, Clayton, Australia. Peptides overlapped by 11 residues, with the exception of peptides 94 and 95 which shared 12 residues. Peptides were biotinylated at the N terminus and were amidated at the C terminus. The biotin group was attached to the N terminus by the intermediary of a four-residue spacer consisting of SGSG. The purity of the peptides ranged from 60 to 70%. The freeze-dried peptides were dissolved in a mixture of 75 parts dimethyl sulfoxide and 25 parts water (v/v), to a concentration of 1.5 mm, divided into aliquots of 30 μl and frozen at −75 °C.ChemicalsThe following chemicals were obtained from Sigma: ferricytochrome c (from horse heart, 95%), NADPH (tetrasodium salt, 95%), bovine serum albumin (crystallized, >97%; BSA), 3,3′,5.5′-tetramethylbenzidine, free base, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), streptavidin (from Streptomyces avidinii, affinity purified), and ImmunoProbe biotinylation kit (product number BK-101).

(17Leto T.L. Garrett M.C. Fujii H. Nunoi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19812-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and purified by ion exchange chromatography, as recently described (18Diatchuk V. Lotan O. Koshkin V. Wikstroem P. Pick E.

Recombinant Rac1 was isolated from E. coli transformed with Rac1 cDNA subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX2T, as described by Kwong et al. (19Kwong C.H. Malech H.L. Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5711-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The glutathioneS-transferase-Rac1 fusion protein was affinity purified on glutathione-agarose, cleaved by thrombin, and subjected to nucleotide exchange to GTPγS, as described before (20Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Baculoviruses carrying cDNA for p47phox and p67phox and Rac1 cDNA subcloned in the pGEX2T vector were kind gifts of Dr. Thomas L. Leto (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).Biotinylation of p47phoxPurified recombinant p47phox (at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) was biotinylated with biotinamidocaproateN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester, using the ImmunoProbe kit (Sigma) and following the instructions provided with the kit. The biotin/protein ratio varied from 3 to 3.5 mol of biotin per mol of p47phox.Preparation of Solubilized Macrophage MembranesMacrophages were obtained from the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs injected with mineral oil 5–6 days earlier. Membranes were prepared from cells disrupted by sonication, as reported before (21Pick E. Gorzalczany Y. Engel S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but using a modified homogenization buffer, which consisted of 130 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na+, potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 340 mm sucrose, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithioerythritol, 2 mm NaN3, 10 μm GDP, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 21 μm leupeptin. The membranes were solubilized by 40 mm octyl glucoside, as described previously (22Shpungin S. Dotan I. Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9195-9203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and freed of octyl glucoside by dialysis for 18 h at 4 °C against solubilization buffer (22Shpungin S. Dotan I. Abo A. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9195-9203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lacking detergent. The concentration of cytochrome b 559 in the solubilized membrane preparation was measured as described before (23Knoller S. Shpungin S. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2795-2804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Determination of Protein ConcentrationThis was measured by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar), modified for use with 96-well plates, as described in technical bulletin 1177EC (Bio-Rad). BSA was used as standard.Cell-free NADPH Oxidase AssayLiDS-elicited cell-free O·̄2 production assays were performed in 96-well, flat bottomed, polystyrene plates (Greiner) at 25 °C. All components were diluted in assay buffer, consisting of 65 mm Na+, potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 0.2 mm cytochrome c, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm FAD, and 2 mm NaN3. Reaction mixtures (100 μl total volume) consisted of (in order of addition) the following: 25 μl of assay buffer (containing or not p47phox peptide); 25 μl of a mixture of solubilized membrane (40 nm cytochromeb 559), p67phox, and Rac1-GTPγS (0.8 μm, each); 25 μl of p47phox (0.24 μm); and 25 μl of assay buffer containing 0.52 mm LiDS. The final concentrations of NADPH oxidase components in the assay were 10 nm cytochromeb 559, 200 nm p67phox and Rac1, and 60 nm p47phox. The final concentration of LiDS was 130 μm. The plates were shaken for 10 s, once after the addition of the mixture of membrane, p67phox, and Rac1, again following the addition of p47phox, and for 1.5 min upon the addition of LiDS. O·̄2 production was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 5 mm NADPH (resulting in a final concentration of 454 μm) and quantified by following the rate of cytochrome c reduction, at 550 nm, in a kinetic assay performed in a Spectramax 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices), using Softmax Pro software. Results were expressed as nanomoles of O·̄2/min (calculated from the linear portion of the curve) produced by the amount of membrane present in one microplate well (corresponding to 1 pmol of cytochromeb 559). Each measurement was performed in triplicate and expressed as the mean value.Inhibition of NADPH Oxidase Activation by p47phoxPeptidesThe effect of overlapping p47phox pentadecapeptides on NADPH oxidase activation was tested in the cell-free system described in the preceding section. Peptides (stock solutions of 1.5 mm in 75% dimethyl sulfoxide, 25% water) were diluted in assay buffer to reach a concentration of 120 μm, and amounts of 25 μl were added per well as the first component of the 100-μl reaction mixtures (resulting in a final concentration of peptide of 30 μm). Control mixtures contained 25 μl of assay buffer supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, a concentration identical to that found in peptide-containing wells. In this experimental set up, the addition of peptide preceded that of p47phox and the induction of activation by LiDS. In a parallel series of experiments, we studied the effect of adding p47phoxpeptides to the cell-free assay after the completion of activation. In these experiments, the components of the assay mixture were added in the following order: a mixture of solubilized membrane, p47phox, p67phox and Rac1-GTPγS in a volume of 50 μl (resulting in the final concentrations of components indicated before); 25 μl of assay buffer containing 0.39 mm LiDS (resulting in a final concentration of 130 μm); and following incubation with mixing for 1.5 min, 25 μl of assay buffer containing 120 μm peptide and 130 μm LiDS (resulting in a final concentration of peptide of 30 μm). The assay mixtures were incubated, with mixing, for 30 s and O·̄2 production initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 5 mm NADPH (resulting in a final concentration of 454 μm).An Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Detection of Protein-Peptide and Protein-Protein Interactions among NADPH Oxidase Components Applied to the Binding of p67phox to p47phox-derived PeptidesAll experiments were performed in 96-well microplates, with flat bottoms and rounded corners (MaxiSorp C96, product 430341, Nunc). 100 μl/well of a 7 μg/ml solution of streptavidin in water were added (= 11.66 pmol of streptavidin/well), and the plates were exposed to circulating air at 37 °C for 18–24 h, to allow the solution to evaporate completely. The streptavidin-coated plates could be kept at 4 °C, under vacuum, in the presence of silica gel dessicant, for up to 4 weeks. Assuming maximal coating with streptavidin, each well should be capable of binding close to 50 pmol of biotin. The plates were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), consisting of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 140 mm NaCl, supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS-T). All washing procedures were performed using an automatic microplate washer (Wellwash type 4 Mk2, Denley Instruments). After removal of washing buffer, nonspecific absorption was blocked by adding to each well 200 μl of 10% (v/v) liquid milk (1% fat) in PBS and shaking the plates for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed four times with PBS-T, and to the wells were added 100-μl volumes of biotinylated p47phox peptides or biotinylated p47phoxprotein, dissolved in 10% milk in PBS, to result in 50 pmol of peptide or protein per well. Binding of biotinylated compounds to the streptavidin-coated plates was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature, with shaking. The plates were again washed four times with PBS-T and, following the removal of washing buffer, 100-μl volumes p67phox, dissolved in 10% milk in PBS, were added, to result in 50 pmol of protein per well. The plates were shaken for 30 min at room temperature to allow the interaction between the surface-attached p47phox peptides or p47phox protein and p67phox, in solution, to proceed. In control experiments, p67phox was replaced by 50 pmol/well of BSA. Unbound protein was removed by washing the plates four times with PBS-T, and the specifically bound p67phox and nonspecifically bound BSA were detected by the addition of 100 μl/well of goat anti-p67phoxand rabbit anti-BSA antisera, diluted 1/1000 in 10% milk in PBS, respectively. The plates were incubated with the antibodies for 30 min at room temperature, with shaking, and unbound antibody was removed by four washes with PBS-T. Bound immunoglobulin was detected by the addition of a 1/10,000 dilution, in 10% milk in PBS, of peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, respectively, and incubation for 30 min at room temperature, with shaking. The plates were washed four times with PBS-T and once with distilled water, and bound peroxidase was detected by the addition of 100 μl/well of 0.1 mg/ml 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and 0.006% H2O2 in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.4. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl/well of 2 nH2SO4. Absorbance at 450 nm was read against blank wells, containing only the peroxidase assay reagent, in a Spectramax 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices).DISCUSSIONIn the present report we describe the application of peptide walking to the identification of domains, in the linear amino acid sequence of p47phox, which participate in the assembly of an enzymatically active NADPH oxidase complex in vitro. We used this methodology before for the definition of oxidase activation-related domains in Rac1 (15Joseph G. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29079-29082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although overlapping peptides were tested exclusively as inhibitors of NADPH oxidase activation in this earlier report, we have now extended their use to binding studies involving p47phox peptides and intact p67phox.The assumptions underlying the use of peptide walking for the identification of domains in p47phox involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase were the following. 1) Inhibition of activity by peptides containing part of or a complete domain is the result of competition between peptide and p47phox protein for a common target, and proof for this is provided by results of Michaelis-Menten analysis, demonstrating a competitive inhibition pattern with respect to p47phox. 2) The use of overlapping peptides results in a high likelihood for a domain or part of it to be present in several neighboring peptides, assuring more sensitive and reliable detection than that offered by the use of selected individual peptides. 3) Peptide walking is, by definition, detecting domains involved in NADPH oxidase activation in the cell-free system, and their role in the elicitation of an oxidative burst in whole cells has to be evaluated by additional methods.The main goal of this research was to assess the capacity of peptide walking to serve as a screening method for the identification of functional domains in p47phox. The success of this methodology was demonstrated by its ability to both detect domains identified before by other techniques and to reveal novel domains. Thus, we identified eight domains (11–15 residues) in the linear sequence of p47phox participating in NADPH oxidase activation in vitro. Four of these correspond to regions identified previously by other methods (domains c–e and g), and four represent newly identified domains (a, b, f, and h) for which no experimental evidence was available for involvement in activation. The reality of two additional domains (a1 and a2), located in the vicinity of domain a, based solely on the inhibitory action of single peptides will have to be confirmed by other methods.Domain a spans residues 21–35 and is rich in hydrophobic amino acids. It does not share residues with domains a1 and a2, but the possibility cannot be excluded that we are dealing with a larger region composed of all three nearly contiguous modules. Recently, it was found that the N-terminal regions of p47phox and p40phox contain a previously unidentified domain, termed PX, also shown to be present in the Cpk class of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and in several yeast proteins (Bem1p and Scd2) (45Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In p47phox, domain PX was proposed to span residues 20–125, and it is possible that the domain might also include a region N-terminal to residue 20 (45Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It is of interest that domains a and a2 are located within the limits of the PX region and contain no less than six PX consensus residues. Should the PX domain extend furt"
https://openalex.org/W2095145863,"We used differential display to discover a new gene that the environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) regulates in mouse hepatoma cells. Its predicted amino acid sequence suggests that the gene encodes an ecto-ATPase that contains multiple glycosylation sites, conserved cysteine residues, and apyrase conserved regions. cDNA expression experiments in mouse hepatoma cells confirm that the new gene encodes an ecto-ATPase. Wild-type mouse hepatoma cells contain both constitutive and TCDD-inducible ecto-ATPase activity. Induction of ecto-ATPase gene expression by TCDD is direct and occurs at the transcriptional level. Studies in mutant hepatoma cells indicate that induction requires both the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt). Furthermore, induction requires AhR's transactivation domain, but not that of Arnt. Our findings reveal new aspects of dioxin's biological effects and TCDD-dependent gene regulation."

[35S]GTPγS binding to the reconstituted Gs protein was enhanced by PACAP27 and PACAP38 (EC50 = 42.5 and 9.4 pm, respectively) but not by antagonist PACAP(6–38), indicating that the purified receptor was functionally active.

PACAP exists in two carboxyl-terminal-amidated forms: PACAP38 with 38 amino acid residues (1Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Molecular cloning studies revealed that the structure of PACAP is highly conserved among rat, sheep, and humans (3Kimura C. Ohkubo S. Ogi K. Hosoya M. Itoh Y. Onda H. Miyata A. Jiang L. Dahl R.R.

PACAP has structural similarity to peptides in the secretin/glucagon peptide family, especially to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) (1Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A.

The biological actions of PACAP are mediated by a PACAP-specific receptor (type I receptor) and a PACAP/VIP-nonselective receptor (type II receptor).

Chem. 1996; 271: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). All of these receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and are subdivided structurally into the secretin/glucagon receptor family (23Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.-J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 94-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that is distinguished from rhodopsin-type receptors.All G protein-coupled receptors have seven hydrophobic segments that probably form transmembrane α-helices. Direct evidence for the arrangement of transmembrane domains was obtained from the two-dimensional crystallography of rhodopsin (24Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), providing valuable information for molecular modeling of other G protein-coupled receptors. More precise modeling requires elucidating the structures of another receptors. In particular, receptors in the secretin/glucagon receptor family are predicted to have a different arrangement in the transmembrane domains (25Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On the other hand, structural biology directly clarifying the three-dimensional structure of a G protein-coupled receptor has been hindered by several difficulties in the purification and crystallization of the receptor protein. Most G protein-coupled receptors exist at very low level in tissue membranes. Thus, it is essential to develop an expression system that can produce a large amount of the recombinant receptor. Parker et al.(26Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first described that a baculovirus expression system was beneficial for the expression of β-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors at high levels (5–30 pmol/mg). Recombinant β-adrenergic receptors purified from the baculovirus-infected insect cells were functionally active as were the β-adrenergic receptors from turkey erythrocytes (26Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression system was also used to produce various G protein-coupled receptors, however, only a few reports (27Doi T. Hiroaki Y. Arimoto I. Fujiyoshi Y. Okamoto T. Satoh M. Furuichi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) succeeded in providing a practical amount of purified receptor for further biochemical or structural studies. This is probably due to difficulty in the solubilization and purification of G protein-coupled receptors.We previously described successful purification of the PACAP1 receptor from bovine brain membranes in a high affinity state (28Ohtaki T. Masuda Y. Ishibashi Y. Kitada C. Arimura A. Fujino M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26650-26657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we conducted large-scale purification of the recombinant PACAP1 receptor by combining the previously described purification procedures and the baculovirus expression system. The recombinant PACAP1receptor purified in a digitonin-solubilized form retained high affinity for PACAP and was functionally active when reconstituted with Gs protein in lipid vesicles. The purified receptor will likely contribute to the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and structure of G protein-coupled receptors.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, the human PACAP receptor was overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells under the control of a strong polyhedrin promoter. The expression level (50–150 pmol/mg) was higher than those of other G protein-coupled receptors so far reported (ranging from 0.5 to 100 pmol/mg) (26Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M.

The presence of a signal sequence and many potential glycosylation sites in the PACAP receptor, favoring the translocation of the receptor to cell membranes, presumably contributes to the high expression level. Furthermore, trimming of the 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions along with the use of pAKKO vector having SRα promoter might increase the expression level of the receptor in CHO/dhfr− cells compared with the previous expression study using CHO-K1 cells and pRc/CMV expression vector (19Ogi K.

(38Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

Additional coupling to another G protein species is suggested by the pleiotropic cellular response to PACAP stimulation such as increases in phosphoinositide turnover (20Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar, 21Pisegna J.R. Wank S.A. J. Biol.

Winand J. Robberecht P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 107: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The recombinant receptor in the Sf9 cell membranes, however, was not coupled to endogenous G proteins as evidenced by its low affinity and GTPγS insensitivity in agonist binding. This is most probably due to a deficiency in the appropriate G proteins. The concentrations of immunoreactive Gi2 and Go proteins in High 5 insect cells were estimated as 10.7 and 0.5 pmol/mg, respectively, while those in Sf9 insect cells were below the detection limit (45Wehmeyer A. Schulz R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This finding strongly suggests that the expression level of Gs-like protein in Sf9 insect cells is also very low. Butkerait et al. (38Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) suggested that the coupling of recombinant receptors to endogenous G proteins in insect cells is related to the receptor expression level. Receptors expressed at a low level, such as the D4 dopamine receptor (5 pmol/mg) (39Mills A. Allet B. Bernard A. Chabert C. Brandt E. Cavegn C. Chollet A. Kawashima E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), serotonin 5-HT1B receptor (0.5 pmol/mg) (40Ng G.Y.K. George S.R. Zastawny R.L. Caron M. Bouvier M. Dennis M. O'Dowd B.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11727-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and 5-HT1A receptor (0.15 pmol/mg) (41Mulheron J.G. Casañas S.J. Arthur J.M. Garnovskaya M.N. Gettys T.W. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12954-12962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were sensitive to guanine nucleotides in agonist binding, indicating coupling to G protein. On the other hand, the 5HT1Areceptor (5–34 pmol/mg) (38Butkerait P. Zheng Y. Hallak H. Graham T.E. Miller H.A. Burris K.D. Molinoff P.B. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18691-18699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the formyl peptide receptor (27 pmol/mg) (42Quehenberger O. Prossnitz E.R. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19757-19760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the β-adrenergic receptor and the muscarinic receptor (30 pmol/mg) (26Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not exhibit GTPγS sensitivity in agonist binding. Therefore, it is not surprising that most of the PACAP receptors overexpressed in insect cells were not coupled to endogenous G proteins.The recombinant PACAP receptor in the Sf9 cell membranes was purified in a digitonin-solubilized form. The purified receptor had a protein core similar to that purified from CHO cells but with differentN-linked sugar chains. The apparent molecular weight of theN-glycanase digested band (M r = 43,000) was smaller than the calculated molecular weight of the protein core (M r = 51,354) (19Ogi K. Miyamoto Y. Masuda Y. Habata Y. Hosoya M. Ohtaki T. Masuo Y. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A possible reason for this discrepancy is proteolytic degradation of the carboxyl terminus region. The carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence could not, however, be determined in the present study. Another possibility is that strong hydrophobic interactions between membrane spanning α-helices restricted complete unfolding, resulting in a higher mobility than soluble proteins with a similar molecular weight.Glycosidase digestion studies suggested structural differences in theN-linked sugar chains of the PACAP receptors. The PACAP receptor from CHO cells was resistant to endoglycosidase H and endoglycosidase F2. Endoglycosidase H digests high mannose-type and hybrid-type sugar chains (46Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1646-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase F2 cleaves biantennary complex-type sugar chains preferentially, but also cleaves high mannose-type sugar chains at a slower rate (46Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1646-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with the result from digestion by exoglycosidases, it is suggested that the receptor from CHO cells has sialylated tri- or tetraantennary complex-type sugar chains. In contrast, the PACAP receptor from Sf9 cells was digested by endoglycosidase F2, indicating that it has biantennary complex-type and/or high mannose-type sugar chains. The presence of biantennary complex-type sugar chains, however, is somewhat controversial, because exoglycosidase digestion studies indicate that the PACAP receptor from Sf9 cells has only mannosyl residues at non-reducing terminal but does not have NeuAc and GlcNAc residues. The presence of high mannose-type sugar chains is compatible with the result from mannosidase digestion but inconsistent with the resistance to endoglycosidase H. Considering that the PACAP receptor from Sf9 cells has truncated N-linked sugar chains (paucimannosidic N-linked sugar chains) (47Altman F. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 101-114Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) rather than high mannose-type sugar chains, this discrepancy could be explained by possible difference between substrate specificity of endoglycosidase H and endoglycosidase F2. Endoglycosidase H scarcely digests some kinds of paucimannosidicN-linked sugar chains such as Manα1→3(Manα1→6)Manβ1→4GlcNAc2 (46Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1646-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the reactivity of endoglycosidase F2 on these sugar chains is not revealed. Direct evidences are required to clarify the structure of N-linked sugar chains in the PACAP receptors.The purified PACAP receptor presented several oligomer bands upon SDS-PAGE. Similar results were found in various G protein-coupled receptors such as rhodopsin (48Borjigin J. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14715-14722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the olfactory receptor (49Nekrasova E. Sosinskaya A. Natochin M. Lancet D. Gat U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pharmacological evidence also suggests that the m2-muscarinic receptor forms a dimeric structure (50Potter L.T. Ballesteros L.A. Bichajian L.H. Ferrendelli C.A. Fisher A. Hanchett H.E. Zhang R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 211-221PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, bacteriorhodpsin has been shown to form a trimeric structure in orthorhombic two-dimensional crystals (51Michel H. Oesterhelt D. Henderson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of receptor oligomerization observed in SDS-PAGE is still unclear, because high temperatures used during SDS-PAGE sample preparation might promote artificial oligomerization via hydrophobic interactions as described by Sagné et al. (52Sagné C. Isambert M.-F. Henry J.-P. Gasnier B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In fact, it was reported that the olfactory receptor forms higher oligomers after prolonged boiling (49Nekrasova E. Sosinskaya A. Natochin M. Lancet D. Gat U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Receptor oligomerization in physiological conditions should be further examined.The purified receptor had high affinity for PACAP27 and PACAP38 but low affinity for VIP. These ligand binding properties were similar to those of the receptor expressed in CHO cells. It has been proposed that digitonin might stabilize the PACAP receptor in the high affinity state based on the observations that purified PACAP receptor has a high affinity by itself (28Ohtaki T. Masuda Y. Ishibashi Y. Kitada C. Arimura A. Fujino M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26650-26657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis was further substantiated by reconstituting the purified PACAP receptor into lipid vesicles. The receptor reconstituted in lipid vesicles alone had low affinity in the absence of digitonin but high affinity in the presence of digitonin. The molecular mechanism of digitonin action, however, is not yet clear. For example, it is not clear whether solubilization into a lipid/digitonin mixed micelle is required for stabilizing the receptor or if the insertion of a small amount of digitonin into membrane bilayers is sufficient. Also, it is not clear whether digitonin acts directly on the receptor protein or acts indirectly by changing the milieu of the membrane or micelle. The small difference found betweenK d values for the purified receptor in a digitonin-solubilized form and the reconstituted receptor in the DG-BSA/TED buffer suggests that complete solubilization is required for the full effect of digitonin. Studies on possible conformational changes in the PACAP receptor induced by digitonin may aid in understanding the G protein-dependent regulation of ligand binding affinity.It should be also noted that the effect of digitonin is different from receptor to receptor. Some G protein-coupled receptors, such as β-adrenergic (53Cubero A. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1344-1350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neuropeptide Y (54Sheikh S.P. Hansen A.P. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23959-23966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) receptors, were solubilized successfully using digitonin. The corticotropin-releasing factor receptor solubilized with digitonin had high affinity for its ligand and no GTPγS sensitivity (55Grigoriadis D.E. Zaczek R. Pearsall D.M. De Souza E.B. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 3068-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), as observed in the present study. In contrast, the use of digitonin failed in the solubilization of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (56Hazum E. Schvartz I. Waksman Y. Keinan D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9442-9446PubMed Google Scholar) receptors. Receptors solubilized with digitonin in high affinity states are easier targets for receptor purification.The PACAP receptor reconstituted with Gsα/Gβγ in lipid vesicles had high affinity for PACAP27, in contrast to that without Gsα/Gβγ. GTPγS, known to inhibit receptor/G protein coupling by destabilizing the G protein trimer, almost completely neutralized the effect of Gsα/Gβγ, demonstrating that the purified PACAP receptor reconstituted in lipid vesicles requires Gsα/Gβγ for expressing high affinity for PACAP27. The B max value also decreased when the PACAP receptor was uncoupled from G protein. The result leads to the hypothesis that there are at least two states in G protein-uncoupled PACAP receptors, a low affinity state (K d = 100–200 pm) and a very low affinity state without detectable affinity for125I-PACAP27. Difference between theB max values in the presence and absence of digitonin represents G protein-uncoupled receptor in a very low affinity state. It should thus be interpreted that the CHO membranes contain G protein-uncoupled spare PACAP receptor as much as G protein-coupled PACAP receptor. The number of the PACAP receptors at the high affinity state (approximately 20–25 pmol/mg) in the CHO membranes reflects the maximum amount of G protein available for coupling to the PACAP receptor.GDP as well as GTPγS or GTP decreased the specific binding of125I-PACAP27 to the reconstituted receptor. The molecular mechanism of GDP action is thought to decrease the dissociation rate of GDP from the G protein α-subunit. Thus, this indicates that high affinity binding of PACAP27 requires the dissociation of GDP, whereas the dissociation of GDP is believed to be promoted by agonist stimulation. In other words, the PACAP receptor has high affinity for PACAP27 when it is interacting with nucleotide-free G protein. Therefore, PACAP binding to the receptor shifts the guanine nucleotide binding equilibrium toward the nucleotide free state, leading to the cooperative PACAP binding and GDP dissociation. A similar result with GDP has been observed in other G protein-coupled receptors such as the muscarinic receptor (58Haga K. Haga T. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10133-10140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Following receptor engagement, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within ZAP-70 and Syk is thought to control both kinase activity and recruitment of modulatory factors. We report here the characterization of novel mutants of ZAP-70 and Syk, in which conserved C-terminal tyrosine residues have been replaced by phenylalanines (ZAP YF-C, Syk YF-C). Both mutant kinases display a prominent gain-of-function phenotype in Jurkat T cells, as demonstrated by lymphokine promoter activation, tyrosine phosphorylation of potential targets in vivo, and elevated intracellular calcium mobilization. While the presence of p56-Lck was required for ZAP YF-C-induced signaling, Syk YF-C showed enhanced functional activity in Lck-deficient JCaM1 Jurkat cells.

This includes the ζ homodimer, as well as the CD3 complex composed of the γ, δ, and ε chains. With the help of chimeric receptors (7Romeo C. Seed B.

The ITAM motif is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo following antigen receptor stimulation. This phosphorylation event was shown to be responsible for the recruitment of the cytoplasmic ZAP-70 kinase to the phosphorylated receptor via phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interactions (6Iwashima M.

Surprisingly, significant activation of the ZAP-70 kinase mediated by its binding to ITAMs could not be demonstrated (14Neumeister E.N. Zhu Y. Richard S. Terhorst C. Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it was suggested that the recruitment of ZAP-70 into the antigen receptor complex provided a platform for “cross-talk” between the Src and ZAP-70 kinases, which leads to phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70 (15Kolanus W.

This phosphorylation event correlated with the functional activity of ZAP-70. Multiple phosphorylation of ZAP-70, mediated by autophosphorylation, by Src kinases, or by other cellular kinases, is thought to result in the association of downstream signaling components by SH2 domain-phosphotyrosine interactions (14Neumeister E.N.

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. Antibodies used were as follows: 2F3.2 mAb directed against ZAP-70 (UBI), 4G10 mAb recognizing phosphotyrosine (UBI), OKT3 anti-CD3-epsilon mAb (purified from hybridoma supernatant on Protein A), antigen affinity-purified goat anti-human IgG Fc-γ fragment specific polyclonal serum (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), M4 anti-chicken IgM monoclonal antibody (Southern Biotechnology), and 3G8 anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody (Medarex). P5C7, a derivative of pRK5 (26Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

Cytoplasmic Ig fusion proteins (cIg) and transmembrane CD16/CD7 chimeras have been described previously (15Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B.

Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). CD16/7/control is a construct that lacks the cytoplasmic domain. The transmembrane Ig fusion proteins (sIg) comprise the leader sequence from CD5, extracellular CH2 and CH3 heavy chain domains from human IgG1, the CD7 transmembrane domain, and the intracellular portions of TCR-ζ (sIg-ζ) or a control polypeptide (sIg-control). Luciferase reporter plasmids used were pIL2-GL2, containing human IL-2 promoter residues −577 to +53 inserted into MluI andHindIII cloning sites of pGL2-Basic (Promega) and a previously described reporter plasmid (28Randak C. Brabletz T. Hergenrother M. Sobotta I. Serfling E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2529-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) comprising three NF-AT binding sites. The coding sequence of the C-terminal portion of human SAM68 (SAM-C; amino acids 331–443) was inserted into pGEX-I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) via BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites and purified as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein fromEscherichia coli DH5α. Mutants of human ZAP-70 were generated in the p5C7 vector by site-directed mutagenesis. Tyrosine residues 597 and 598, located downstream of the conserved kinase domain, were replaced by phenylalanines (YF-C); tyrosine 292, located in the interdomain B of ZAP-70, was changed to phenylalanine (Y292F); tyrosine 492, located in the putative activation loop of ZAP-70 (29Kong G. Dalton M. Wardenburg J.B. Straus D. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), was converted to phenylalanine (Y492F); lysine 369, required for efficient ATP binding, was modified to glycine (K−). Mutants of human Syk were generated in p5C7 and expressed as cytoplasmic Ig fusion proteins. Tyrosines 624, 625, and 626 were changed to phenylalanines (Syk YF-C), lysine 397 to glycine (Syk K−). DEAE-dextran transfections of COS-7 cells were performed as described previously (30Aruffo A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3313-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected using the EasyjecT Plus electroporation system (Eurogentec). Cells (1.3 × 107 in complete medium) were mixed for 5 min at room temperature with 10 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid plus the indicated amount of cytomegalovirus promoter expression plasmids. TAg-Jurkat T cells were pulsed at 310 V and 1200 microfarads, JCaM1.6 cells at 240 V and 1200 microfarads and immediately transferred to 10 ml of complete medium, routinely resulting in transfection efficiencies of 60–70% for TAg and 30–40% for JCaM1.6. Twelve to twenty hours after transfection, cells were aliquoted and stimulated for 8 h in 1 ml of complete medium using 0.5 μg/ml ionophore A23187 (Sigma), 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma), 2 μg/ml OKT3, or 2 μg/ml anti-human IgG antibody, or left untreated. Syk-deficient DT40 cells were transfected as described (31Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and stimulated with ionophore plus PMA as above or with 3 μg/ml M4 anti-BCR antibody for 8 h. Cells were subsequently washed in Tris-buffered saline and lysed in 50 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was quantified in a microplate scintillation counter (Packard) after mixing 20 μl of cell lysate with 100 μl of luciferase reagent (Promega). Luciferase activities are expressed relative to the ionophore/PMA-stimulated sample and are average values of triplicate experiments with standard deviations less than 20%. For immunoprecipitations, cells were transfected as described above. T cells were lysed 12–20 h after transfection, COS-7 cells after 48 h. Stimulation of Jurkat cells was performed in 50–100 μl of RPMI by adding 2 μg of OKT3 or anti-human IgG for the indicated time period at 37 °C. For SDS total cell lysates, SDS was added to a concentration of 1% following stimulation. Detergent lysis buffer contained 1% Brij 97, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (all from Sigma). Alternatively, 1% digitonin was used as detergent for OKT3 immunoprecipitations. After 20 min at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g to remove insoluble material. Anti-ZAP-70 antibody was added at 1 μg/ml and OKT3 at 5 μg/ml, respectively, whereas Ig fusion proteins were directly collected on Protein A-6MB-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer prior to dissociation in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetections were performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova) and chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ZAP-70 and its mutant variants were transiently expressed in TAg-Jurkat T cells and purified by immunoprecipitation as described above. Additionally, precipitates were washed once in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 m LiCl and twice in kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2). Autophosphorylation experiments were performed for 10 min at 25 °C in 25 μl of kinase buffer in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol). For substrate phosphorylation assays, 5 μg of purified glutathioneS-transferase-SAM-C and 10 μm unlabeled ATP were included in each reaction. Samples were boiled in SDS loading buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by autoradiography, Ponceau S staining, and immunodetection. Quantification of radioactive signals was done using a microchannel array detector (InstantImager, Packard). Jurkat E6 and JCaM1.6 cells were transfected with chimeric transmembrane CD16/7/Syk mutants by infection with recombinant vaccinia virus as described (15Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). After 6 h, cells were washed and loaded with the fluorescent calcium probe Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h in Hanks' buffered saline solution, washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter Epics XL). Expression levels were monitored by anti-CD16 immunofluorescence. The ZAP-70 and Syk tyrosine kinases are highly homologous. One exception is ZAP-70, which is bears a unique extended C terminus. However, a cluster of tyrosines (YY597/598 in ZAP-70, YYY624–626 in Syk) located close to the C terminus, is conserved between the two kinases (Fig. 1 A). In order to test whether these tyrosines are important for cellular activation events mediated by ZAP-70, we altered the residues by site-directed mutagenesis (ZAP YY597/598FF, ZAP YF-C). ZAP YF-C as well as wild type or mutant control constructs of ZAP-70 were transiently expressed in several cell lines at similar levels (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). In order to test the functional activity of ZAP YF-C, it was co-transfected with reporter constructs into the TAg-Jurkat T cell leukemia line (Fig. 2). For comparison, the following expression constructs were used: (a) wild type ZAP-70; (b) ZAP Y292F, a previously described gain-of-function mutant of ZAP-70 (29Kong G. Dalton M. Wardenburg J.B. Straus D. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); (c) ZAP Y492F, a mutant that has been shown to have enhanced catalytic activity (16Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar,32Wange R.L. Guitian R. Isakov N. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18730-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); and (d) a kinase-inactive point mutant of ZAP-70 (K369G). The reporter constructs bore either the intact IL-2 promoter/enhancer region (−577 to +53) or three copies of the isolated NF-AT element in tandem array, both driving the firefly luciferase gene. The transfected cell populations were analyzed for either direct induction or synergistic activation of the IL-2 promoter with an antibody directed against the TCR (OKT3), with phorbol ester (PMA), or with a combination of both these reagents (Fig. 2). The complete IL-2 promoter/enhancer was found to be stimulated 3-fold by OKT3, 5-fold by PMA, and 30-fold by simultaneous use of both stimuli. In this setting we found that overexpression of ZAP YF-C mimicked the activated, OKT3-stimulated T cell receptor (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, the signal generated by OKT3/PMA was augmented 2-fold either by ZAP YF-C overexpression, or by expression of the previously described gain-of-function mutant Y292F (31Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild type ZAP-70 or ZAP Y492F had only a very moderate effect (Fig. 2 A), which is in accordance with previous results (31Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A kinase-inactive version of ZAP-70 acted in a dominant negative fashion on TCR activation, as was expected from recent reports (33Northrop J.P. Pustelnik M.J. Lu A.T. Grove J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Qian D. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) because the intact SH2 domains of the mutant probably blocked the accessibility of phosphorylated ITAMs for endogenous ZAP-70. A similar phenotype for ZAP YF-C was obtained when the NF-AT reporter was used (Fig. 2 B). Since this reporter construct is more sensitive than the complete IL-2 promoter, ZAP YF-C expression yielded about 30% of the maximal luciferase signal in otherwise unstimulated cells (7-fold induction). However, the expression of wild type ZAP-70 or ZAP Y492F had minimal effect over background (Fig. 2 B). Titration analyses (Fig. 2 C) proved that ZAP YF-C or ZAP Y292F were about equally efficient in boosting the OKT3/PMA response in a saturable fashion, whereas ZAP YF-C was substantially more potent in inducing the IL-2 promoter in cells that had been treated with phorbol ester only. We conclude that ZAP YF-C is a novel gain-of-function mutant with the capacity to enhance lymphokine promoter-mediated gene expression in TAg-Jurkat cells. To analyze whether the gain-of-function mediated by ZAP YF-C correlated with increased substrate phosphorylation in vivo, we investigated the cellular tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of TAg-Jurkat cells that had been transfected with ZAP YF-C or control constructs (Fig. 3). Vector-transfected Jurkat cells that had been stimulated with OKT3 were found to be substantially enriched in a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins as compared with unstimulated control cells (Fig. 3 A,first and last lanes, respectively). Overexpression of either ZAP-70, ZAP Y492F, or kinase-inactive ZAP-70 in unstimulated cells does not result in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins except for a band at 68–70 kDa. This band corresponds at least in part to the overexpressed ZAP-70 variants (data not shown). However, this background phosphorylation, induced by overexpression and seen for all ZAP-70 versions, does not correlate with substantial IL-2 promoter activation (Fig. 2). In contrast, ZAP YF-C overexpression resulted in a markedly different pattern (Fig. 3 A). First, the 70-kDa band was found to be considerably more highly phosphorylated as compared with the controls. Second, other cellular proteins showed enhanced phosphorylation following ZAP YF-C overexpression, namely at 21–23 kDa, at 55–56 kDa, and at about 150 kDa. The 21–23-kDa phosphorylated bands appeared particularly striking because they corresponded precisely to the described sizes of the phosphorylated TCR ζ chain. Thus, ZAP YF-C overexpression induces the phosphorylation of a characteristic subset of cellular proteins, as compared with OKT3-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Immunoprecipitation of the intact TCR complex from digitonin lysates and subsequent phosphotyrosine analysis demonstrated the phosphorylation of TCR components induced by ZAP YF-C expression (Fig. 3 B). The antigen receptor complex of unstimulated cells in which ZAP YF-C had been expressed contained two major phosphoproteins, ZAP-70 and ζ, the identities of which were confirmed independently (data not shown). From comparison of panels A andB in Fig. 3, it is apparent that phosphorylated ZAP-70 is not quantitatively associated with the TCR complex, and this was confirmed by a phosphotyrosine analysis of the cytoplasmic fraction of transfected TAg-Jurkat cells (data not shown). Overexpression of wild type or kinase-inactive ZAP-70 resulted in a very moderate increase in ζ chain phosphorylation, which is consistent with a previously described protection of phospho-ζ from cellular tyrosine phosphatases by an increase of the cellular concentration of the SH2 domains of ZAP-70 (34Qian D. Mollenauer M.N. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35Mege D. Di Bartolo V. Germain V. Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32644-32652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This increased background, however, did not correlate with cellular activation (Figs. 2 and 3 B). On the other hand, ZAP YF-C expression resulted in a strongly enhanced phosphorylation of ζ. Here it was primarily the 23-kDa isoform, which had previously been described to correlate with T cell activation (36Madrenas J. Wange R.L. Wang J.L. Isakov N. Samelson L.E. Germain R.N.

Increased phosphorylation was also observed for a 27-kDa band, which probably corresponds to the phosphorylated ε chain of the CD3 complex. Our observations were confirmed and extended for OKT3-stimulated cells. Phosphorylation of the 23-kDa isoform of ζ was found to be most strongly increased in ZAP YF-C-transfected cells.This correlated with a relative maximum IL-2 promoter activation profile (Figs. 2 and 3 B). We subsequently analyzed whether the catalytic activity of ZAP YF-C was activated in respect to exogenous substrates. ZAP YF-C as well as positive or negative controls were expressed in TAg-Jurkat cells, immunoprecipitated via a monoclonal antibody, and used inin vitro kinase assays. The in vitro substrate used to determine their respective kinase activities was a fragment of the SAM68 protein (14Neumeister E.N. Zhu Y. Richard S. Terhorst C. Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that had been expressed in, and purified from,E. coli. The positive control mutant, ZAP Y492F, which had been shown to have a substantially enhanced catalytic activity in vitro (16Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 32Wange R.L. Guitian R. Isakov N. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18730-18733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), was consistently found to be a more potent kinase in this assay than the wild type ZAP-70 protein (4-fold enhancement, Fig. 4 A). ZAP YF-C displayed about 1.6-fold enhanced kinase activity (Fig. 4 A). The autocatalytic activity of isolated ZAP YF-C was likewise only moderately enhanced (about 2-fold, Fig. 4 B). To obtain signal intensities comparable to the exogenous substrate phosphorylation, cytoplasmic immunoglobulin fusion proteins (27Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) of ZAP-70, quantitatively purified on Protein A-Sepharose beads, were used. Furthermore, we investigated whether the YF-C mutation resulted in an altered binding of ZAP-70 to tyrosine-phophorylated ITAMs in vitro. A chimeric receptor that contained the complete cytoplasmic domain of the TCR-associated ζ chain (sIg-ζ) was co-expressed with Lck in COS cells, and the fusion protein was subsequently purified by affinity chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose. Aliquots of the beads were then incubated with COS cell lysates, which contained overexpressed wild type or mutant ZAP-70 proteins. The associations of the ZAP-70 derivatives with the phosphorylated ζ fusion protein was found to be identical (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that none of the mutations had any influence on binding of ZAP-70 to phosphorylated ITAMs. Thus, the YF-C mutation of ZAP-70 has a moderately increasing effect on the catalytic activity of the kinase in vitro, but does not affect the binding of the SH2 domains to phosphorylated ITAMs under in vitro conditions. Since it has been suggested that ZAP-70 requires the Lck tyrosine kinase for its in vivo activity (16Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether ZAP YF-C was uncoupled from known upstream signaling events. Jurkat JCaM1.6 cells that do not express kinase-active Lck (5Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) were used for this part of the study. Fig. 5 A shows that JCaM1.6 cells were completely unresponsive to ZAP YF-C expression or other stimuli, unless the TCR signaling pathway of these cells was reconstituted by Lck. Co-transfection experiments revealed that ZAP YF-C had a similar gain-of-function activity in JCaM1.6 cells when Lck was present. Thus, Lck appears to be a necessary component of the pathway utilized by the ZAP YF-C mutant. In order to test whether the observed effects were specific for T cell activation, we transfected ZAP YF-C, along with relevant controls, into the Syk-negative DT40 cell line that had previously been used to study the cellular function of ZAP-70 mutants (16Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 29Kong G. Dalton M. Wardenburg J.B. Straus D. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 485-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of either wild type ZAP-70 or ZAP YF-C resulted in reconstitution of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway (Fig. 5 B), but we did not find an enhanced response of ZAP YF-C, as compared with wild type ZAP-70. However, the cells were sensitive to hyperactivation in principle, because the ZAP Y292F and ZAP Y492F mutants augmented the anti-BCR response dramatically, as was described previously (29Kong G. Dalton M. Wardenburg J.B. Straus D. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We conclude that ZAP YF-C exerts its function in a cell-specific manner. It was recently reported that the Syk tyrosine kinase can be phosphorylated in vitro at positions 625–626 (41Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 42Furlong M.T. Mahrenholz A.M. Kim K.H. Ashendel C.L. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which are homologous to the tyrosine residues 597/598 in ZAP-70. Furthermore, previous studies showed that Syk is not strictly dependent on the activity of Lck (15Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 43Latour S. Fournel M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4434-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44Williams S. Couture C. Gilman J. Jascur T. Deckert M. Altman A. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 45Chu D.H. Spits H. Peyron J.F. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Weiss A.

Biochem. 1997; 246: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore made the corresponding Syk YF-C mutant and tested its ability to activate the IL-2 promoter in TAg-Jurkat cells. In this part of the study, intracellular Ig fusion proteins (27Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) of Syk or Syk YF-C were used to ensure comparable expression levels (Fig. 6 A). Fig. 6 B(left panel) shows that overexpression of both wild type Syk or Syk YF-C enhanced the responsiveness of cells that were stimulated by OKT3 and PMA. However, in cells that were treated with PMA only, Syk YF-C stimulated the IL-2 promoter 10-fold, whereas wild type Syk had a moderate (2.5-fold) effect. We then expressed Syk YF-C in JCaM1.6 cells (Fig. 6 B, right panel). Syk YF-C but not wild type Syk activated the IL-2 promoter in PMA-treated JCaM1.6 cells dramatically, essentially overcoming the need for TCR occupancy. It should be noted that wild type Syk is capable of activating TAg-Jurkats or JCaM1.6 cells at substantially higher expression levels (data not shown), consistent with previous reports (44Williams S. Couture C. Gilman J. Jascur T. Deckert M. Altman A. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 45Chu D.H. Spits H. Peyron J.F. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6251-6261Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, our data show that Syk YF-C has a markedly increased activity when compared with the wild type kinase. Thus, the activating potential of the Syk YF-C mutation is independent of the presence of Lck. Finally, we tested the ability of the Syk YF-C mutant to induce intracellular calcium mobilization, an important receptor proximal event known to be inducible by Syk/ZAP-70 family tyrosine kinases. To this end, tripartite chimeras were constructed that comprised the extracellular domain of the CD16 antigen, the CD7 transmembrane domain, and either the wild type Syk or Syk YF-C molecules as intracellular portions (15Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were expressed by using recombinant vaccinia viruses in Jurkat E6 or JCaM1.6 cells (Fig. 7 A), two cell types in which virus dependent overexpression of the Syk chimeras was comparable. Fig. 7 B (left panel) shows that expression of the 16/7/Syk chimera induces a constitutive high level of intracellular calcium in E6 cells, as was described previously (15Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the case of Syk YF-C, however, calcium levels were superinduced by aggregation of the chimera. In contrast, we discovered that expression of the Syk chimeras did not result in a constitutive induction of calcium in JCaM1.6 cells (Fig. 7 B, right panel), but that the onset of calcium mobilization was inducible by aggregation. Extracellular stimulation of Syk YF-C with antibodies in JCaM1.6 cells induced a strong signal with respect to both kinetics and amplitude, whereas wild type Syk responded weakly and later. These data independently demonstrate a gain-of-function phenotype for Syk YF-C. Gain-of-function mutations have been successfully used in the past to study signal transduction pathways, because they provide a genetic tool to analyze sequential events within signaling cascades. In this study we describe novel gain-of-function mutants of ZAP-70 (ZAP YF-C) and Syk, in which tyrosines 597/598 or 624–626, respectively, have been substituted by phenylalanines. Tyrosines 625–626 of Syk had previously been shown to be autophosphorylated in vitro (41Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,42Furlong M.T. Mahrenholz A.M. Kim K.H. Ashendel C.L. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and therefore appeared to be good targets for a functional analysis. Previously published data were furthermore compatible with functional tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 at multiple residues (14Neumeister E.N. Zhu Y. Richard S. Terhorst C. Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Watts J.D. Affolter M. Krebs D.L. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29520-29529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that expression of ZAP YF-C resulted in an activation of the IL-2 promoter or the NF-AT element in TAg-Jurkat cells. Furthermore, it led to hyperactivation of JCaM1.6 cells when these were reconstituted with Lck. Biochemical analyses revealed that ZAP YF-C induces phosphorylation of the TCR ζ chain and other cellular substrates. The YF-C mutation of ZAP-70 also appears to induce cellular responses in a cell specific fashion. Consistently, expression of a Syk YF-C chimera in JCaM1.6 cells activated the IL-2 promoter and strongly induced intracellular calcium mobilization in response to antibody-mediated clustering. ZAP YF-C expression correlates well with phosphorylation of cellular substrates, but in vitro data show that a direct modulation of the kinase activity is rather unlikely. The other described gain-of-function mutant of ZAP-70, Y292F, has also not been found to be associated with enhanced kinase activity in vitro (31Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Since Syk has been reported to be phosphorylated at the YF-C sitein vitro, the most likely explanations for the observed phenotypes are (a) enhanced recruitment of a second kinase or (b) the sequestration of an inhibitory protein (e.g. a phosphatase). The first possibility seems less likely, since enhanced recruitment of Lck or activation of Lck was not found (data not shown), and thein vitro kinase activity of immunoprecipitated ZAP YF-C protein complexes, which might contain associated kinases, was not significantly enhanced. However, this does not rule out an as yet unknown kinase. It was recently suggested that the activating potential of the Y292F mutation is based on the loss of interaction of phosphorylated Y292 with c-Cbl (47Lupher Jr., M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). If an analogous inhibitory mechanism is the basis for the YF-C phenotype, then it is unlikely to be mediated by c-Cbl as well, because the phenotypes of the mutants are different. In our hands, YF-C has a stronger activating potential as compared with Y292F in Jurkat cells and, more significantly, ZAP YF-C-mediated cellular activation appears to be restricted to the T cell lineage, whereas Y292F is hyperactive in Syk-negative DT40 cells (29Kong G. Dalton M. Wardenburg J.B. Straus D. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our data confirmed previous results, which had shown that the Y492F mutation of ZAP-70 activates B cells only. It therefore appears that common as well as cell-specific effector mechanisms of Syk/ZAP-70 type kinases exist, regulating downstream signaling events in hematopoietic cells. We have found that cellular substrates are phosphorylated upon ZAP YF-C expression. Among these was the 23-kDa isoform of the TCR ζ chain. Direct phosphorylation by ZAP YF-C can most likely be ruled out because ζ is a poor substrate for ZAP-70 (48Isakov N. Wange R.L. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15753-15761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, ζ phosphorylation by ZAP YF-C was not found to be enhanced in vitro (data not shown). However, the observed phosphorylation of p23 ζ is compatible with either the activation of a second kinase or the sequestration of a phosphatase. In summary, we have identified tyrosines in the C-terminal regions of ZAP-70 and Syk that regulate their own functional activity in T cells. We thank E.-L. Winnacker for support and encouragement, Brian Seed for the surface immunoglobulin vector, Tomohiro Kurosaki and Michael Reth for the Syk-negative DT40 cells, Edgar Serfling for the NF-AT reporter construct, and members of the laboratory for discussion and advice."

The structure of TnC closely resembles that of calmodulin, a ubiquitous calcium sensor, with an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain connected by a long central α-helix. Under physiological conditions the C-terminal domain of TnC is always occupied by Ca2+ or Mg2+. In the N-terminal domain the low affinity sites of TnC bind calcium ions when they are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal or cardiac muscle myocytes. The conformational changes brought about by the calcium binding to the N-terminal domain of skeletal troponin C (sTnC) have been followed by NMR (1Gagne S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B.

According to the paradigm the Ca2+-induced conformational changes of the N-terminal domain are transmitted to the other components of the troponin complex and then to tropomyosin, triggering the muscle contraction (8MacLachlan L.K.

The sequence of the cardiac TnC (cTnC) is 70% identical to that of sTnC, whose structure in the calcium-saturated form has been determined by x-ray crystallography (7Herzberg O. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 761-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 13Satyshur K.A. Rao S.T. Pyzalska D. Drendel W. Greaser M. Sundaralingam M. J. Biol.

However, while the N-terminal domain of sTnC contains two calcium-binding sites, the N-terminal domain of cTnC has only one intact Ca2+-binding site. The other site, often referred as a defunct site, does not bind calcium. The functional meaning of this difference between the cardiac and skeletal troponin C has not been explained in structural terms. Even if there is no direct structural proof that the molecular mechanism of action of cTnC is the same as for sTnC, evidence has been given that also in cTnC the N-terminal domain is responsible for the regulation. It is assumed that the C-terminal domain plays primarily a structural role, since its calcium-binding sites are occupied even when the intracellular calcium concentration drops to micromolar values (15Dong W.

Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) working on cysteine (Cys-35 and Cys-84) to serine-mutated cTnC, showed that, in its calcium-saturated form, the N-terminal domain is in the closed conformation. This result implies that there is a much smaller conformational change to be expected upon calcium binding than in sTnC as proved by the very recent study by Spyracopoulos et al. (18Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We aimed to confirm the existence of the closed form of the N-terminal domain for the human cTnC. Since the closed form of the N-terminal domain of cTnC was an unexpected result, we wanted to assess the structural integrity by dynamics measurements to get insight into a plausible conformational exchange between the closed and open states. The coding sequence of human cTnC was cloned by using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique and human heart poly(A)+ RNA as a template and primers (20Jansson M. Li Y.-C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione G. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The amplified DNA fragment was digested, purified, and subcloned to the pGEM3-vector (Promega). For protein expression the subcloned insert was isolated and ligated to the glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia PL-Biochemicals) (19Pollesello P. Ovaska M. Kaivola J. Tilgmann C. Lundstrom K. Kalkkinen N. Ulmanen I. Nissinen E. Taskinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28584-28590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial expression for production of human cTnC glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was carried out in Escherichia coli DH5 α-cells. The cells were grown at 37 °C overnight in minimum medium according to Jansson et al. (20Jansson M. Li Y.-C. Jendeberg L. Anderson S. Montelione G. Nilsson B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 7: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), using ammonium chloride instead of ammonium sulfate. The culture was diluted 1:25 in minimum medium containing15N-labeled ammonium chloride (1 g/liter) and grown at 37 °C to the middle of the growth phase, prior to induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and an aliquot of the collected cells was analyzed for estimation of the amount of cTnC N-terminal fragment by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The collected bacterial paste of the 5-liter culture was diluted in 50 ml of 16 mmNa2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-100, pH 7.3, buffer containing 0.2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 25 μl of bentzonuclease. The cells were disrupted by sonication on ice. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation and used as the starting material for purification on the glutathione Sepharose (10 ml; Pharmacia) affinity column. The recombinant human cTnC was further purified by HPLC anion exchange chromatography (Mono-Q HR 5/5) as described by Pollesello et al. (19Pollesello P. Ovaska M. Kaivola J. Tilgmann C. Lundstrom K. Kalkkinen N. Ulmanen I. Nissinen E. Taskinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28584-28590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The free calcium was removed using Chelex-100 affinity chromatography (30 ml; Bio-Rad) equilibrated in water/ammonia solution, pH 8.0, and the eluted purified protein was freeze-dried. The amount of protein was estimated according to Bradford (21Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The purity of the purified human cTnC fragment was analyzed by reversed phase HPLC (C1 TSK TMS 250 column, 0.46 × 4 cm) (19Pollesello P. Ovaska M. Kaivola J. Tilgmann C. Lundstrom K. Kalkkinen N. Ulmanen I. Nissinen E. Taskinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28584-28590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (22Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The reversed-phase chromatography-purified protein peak was further analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desporption isonization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Samples of the freeze-dried N-terminal fragment of cTnC (10 mg) were dissolved in 500 μl of a solution containing 7.7 mm dithiotreitol in H2O. Dithiothreitol was added to prevent potential dimerization of cNTnC due to a possible disulfide formation between Cys-35 or Cys-84. The pH was adjusted at 6.0 with the addition of microliters of NaOH 0.5m. Thereafter, CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 3.9 mm. Finally, D2O and perdeuterated trifluoroethanol (TFE) were added in order to obtain 750 μl of a 1.3 mm protein solution in 82% H2O, 9% D2O, 9% perdeuterated TFE, at pH 6.0 ± 0.1 (not corrected for the deuteron effect). 15N-Labeled sample (1.3 mm) was prepared to 300 μl in a Shigemi microcell. NMR spectra were acquired mostly with a 600-MHz Varian Unity NMR spectrometer, and certain spectra were taken with a 500-MHz Varian Unity and a 400-MHz ARX Bruker spectrometer. For the nonlabeled sample homonuclear two-dimensional spectra, correlation spectroscopy (COSY), relayed COSY, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY with mixing times of 30, 50, 80, and 110 ms), double quantum and nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOESY with mixing times of 50, 100, 150, and 200 ms), were collected at 30 °C and at 40 and 50 °C (with mixing times 150 and 200 ms, respectively). For the 15N-labeled sample, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy spectra were taken at temperatures from 20 to 50 °C with 2 °C increments.15N-Edited TOCSY (50 and 90 ms) and NOESY (180 ms) as well as T 1 (with relaxation delays 42, 168, 336, 589, 841, 1114, 1514, 2102, and 2691 ms), T 2 (16, 17, 64, 95, 127, 159, 223, 286, and 382 ms) and heteronuclear NOE spectra were recorded at 30 °C. In the CPMG spin echo pulse sequence the delay (2Δ) was 900 μs (23Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar). The 15N spin lock strength in T 1ρ measurements (4, 8, 15, 30, 46, 61, 76, 106, and 122 ms) was limited to 1.7 kHz due to experimental restrictions. The cross-correlation rate (η) was determined by the relaxation interference measurement (24Tjandra N. Szabo A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6986-6991Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The relaxation delay (2Δ) was 70 ms. The data were processed with Felix 95 software. Spin systems were assigned from the through bond correlation spectra and sequence specific assignments were deduced from the NOEs between the adjacent spin systems. The spectral overlap was partly unraveled by 15N editing and exploiting temperature dependence of HN resonances. Distance restraints were extracted from the homonuclear NOE data by fitting a second-order polynomial to integrated cross-peak volumes (I) of the NOE series. Additional distance restraints were extracted from NOEs observable in the 15N-edited spectra according to intensity. The intramethylene and helical NHi-NHi+1 NOEs served for the calibration. Distances were given +20 and −50% uncertainties. There was no objectives to tighten the distance limits because of a likely presence of conformational exchange and spin diffusion in the15N-edited NOE spectrum. When a distance could not be extracted from the build-up curve, owing to a overlap, a poor signal-to-noise ratio or disturbances, the distance was restrained to be at most 5.0 Å. The upper bounds were extended by 1.0 Å for each pseudo atom in methyl groups and 1.5 Å for pseudo atoms in aromatic rings. Backbone φ dihedral angles characterized by smallJ NHα, measured from COSY spectra, were restrained to the helical conformation (±30 degrees) on the basis of the Karplus relation and NOEs (25Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986: 162-175Google Scholar). Dihedral angles characterized by intermediate J NHα were not constrained. The temperature dependence of HN δNH(T) was measured from two-dimensional spectra, α proton chemical shifts (δHA) and J NHα served to recognize secondary structures. A residue was constrained by NHi-COi+4 hydrogen bond (±0.2 Å) provided that at least for three subsequent residues δNH(T) < 0.005 ppm/ °C and δHA were smaller by 0.1 ppm than the corresponding random coil values and J NHα < 6 Hz. The calcium binding site was constrained by six distances between the calcium-ion and carbons in the coordinating carboxyl groups (2.1–3.9 Å). The short β-sheet between the calcium binding loop and the pseudo site was constrained by two hydrogen bonds. Structures were generated by distance geometry followed by restrained simulated annealing. The structures were iteratively refined. At each iteration, distance restraints corresponding to degenerate NOEs were included provided that it was possible to exclude all but one alternative based on clearly longer distances. The procedure was finished when no more restraints could be imposed. The assignment and structure calculations were carried out by Felix and InsightII 95 software. A final set of structures was analyzed for RMSD, energy, backbone dihedrals, exposed surface, distance violations by PROCHECK and InsightII programs. Difference distance matrices (DDM) were calculated with a program modified to compute DDMs for families of structures. The relaxation and heteronuclear NOE data were analyzed in terms of the commonly used Lipari-Szabo model-free spectral density (26Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4558Crossref Scopus (3409) Google Scholar) with the programs by Palmer (27Palmer III, A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The overall correlation time τm was estimated from R 2/R 1ratios (28Kay L.E. Torchia D. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). The cross-correlation rate between the dipole dipole and chemical shift anisotropy (29Goldman M. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 60: 437-452Google Scholar) was measured by a modified HSQC1H-15N correlation experiment with a relaxation period prior to the 15N evolution time, as described by Tjandra et al. (24Tjandra N. Szabo A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6986-6991Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). During the relaxation period (2Δ) the two 15N doublets relax with rates proportional to the square of the sum and difference of double dipole and chemical shift assay interactions. The in- and anti-phase components are subsequently chosen separately for the detection yielding two spectra. The cross-correlation rate (η) is obtained from the ratio of the signal intensities (I A and I B) of the two spectra by η = (1/2Δ)tanh−1(I A/I B) (24Tjandra N. Szabo A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6986-6991Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The structure of the calcium-loaded form of the N-terminal domain of cTnC (Fig. 1) comprises five helices, i.e. N (residues 4–10), A (14Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D.

Reson. 1984; 60: 437-452Google Scholar), B (43–47), C (57–64), and D (74–89). The A and B helices and the C and D helices form a pair of EF-hands connected by the central loop between the B and C helices. The defunct site is between the A and B helices and the calcium binding site between the C and D helices. The two sites are spatially close, and there are interstrand hydrogen bonds between the backbone amide protons and carbonyl oxygens (residues 36 and 72). The spatially adjacent N, A, and D helices are approximately orthogonal to each other, and they form a compact structural unit, the NAD-unit (18Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The structural statistics are given in TableI. The overall fold is defined by 224 long range NOEs. The backbone heavy atom RMSD is 1.1 ± 0.2 Å. The helices and the calcium binding site are well defined. Three residues at each termini, the defunct site, and the central loop have larger RMSD (≈2 Å). The all heavy atom RMSD is 1.8 ± 0.2 Å. The extensive spectral overlap in the aliphatic region prevented us from deriving stereospecific assignments for side chain methylene groups. The RMSD per residue reflects approximately the distribution of the number of restraints (on the average 19) per residue.Table ICharacteristics of the structures of Ca2+-cNTnCDistance restraints Total1356 Intraresidue474 Interresidue882 Sequential363 Medium295i,i+282i,i+3155i,i+458 Long224Dihedral restraints φ32Restraint violations/structure Distance of >0.5 Å0 Distance of >0.3 Å1.4 Distance of >0.1 Å43RMSD (Å) Backbone atoms (CA, CO, N)1.08 ± 0.24 All atoms1.75 ± 0.22φ, ψ in core or allowed regions93.8% Open table in a new tab The orientation of the A and B helices is based on the observation of 20 NOEs. These NOEs are primarily between aliphatic protons. For example, we find an NOE between Phe-20 and Met-45, which are in the middle of the A helix and the B helix, respectively. In an open conformation these distances would be clearly longer, and NOEs except in the vicinity of the loop would be beyond detection. However, the uncertainty in the side chain to side chain distance bounds involving particularly the pseudo atoms of methyl groups do not allow us to determine the interhelical angles precisely. Due to the overlap of in the two-dimensional homonuclear spectra, few NOEs between the A and B as well as between the C and D helices were not assigned. The loop between the A and B helices, i.e. the defunct site, is quite irregular and not particularly well defined. We identify 17 NOEs from the defunct loop. In the central loop between the B and C helices the prolines 52 and 54 are both in the trans configurations. We did not find any evidence for cis-trans isomerism. The rate constants of the 15N longitudinal relaxation (R 1) are nearly constant (1.5 ± 0.2 s−1) over the entire sequence. Only for Gly-91, the R 1 is substantially smaller. The variation in the rate constant of the transverse relaxation (R 2) is larger. For the helices and the calcium binding site the R 2 values are 10 ± 2 s−1 and toward the N- and C termini theR 2 values drop for a few residues. Furthermore, for residues Val-28, Ser-37, Thr-38, Lys-39, Glu-40, Ile-61, and Val-64 the transverse relaxation proceeds so fast that the rate constants (>15 s−1) could not be determined reliably. The values ofR 1ρ for residues 37–40 were smaller than the corresponding R 2 values but owing to the off-resonance effects (30Peng J.W. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 308-332Google Scholar) quantitative comparisons were not made. The15N line widths for these residues measured from the HSQC spectrum recorded at 30 °C are indeed larger than on the average (Fig. 2). Whereas at increased temperature (40 and 50 °C), the line widths are only 1–2 Hz wider than on the average. At lower temperatures (10 and 20 °C), also the lines for residues Ile-36, Leu-41 and Gly-42 become broader than the average (Fig. 3). The rate of the15N cross-correlation (η) between the dipole and chemical shift anisotropy was insensitive to the conformational exchange. The comparison of η with R 2 reveals residues experiencing fast transverse relaxation (Fig. 3). For the residues (Val-28, Thr-38, Lys-39, Ile-61, and Val-64) with very fast transverse relaxation, no values of η were obtained due to the insensitivity of the cross-correlation experiment.Figure 3A, 15N line widths were measured at 20 (•), 30 (○), and 40 °C (▪) versusresidue. Residues 52 and 54 are prolines. Other missing data points are due to overlaps or extreme broadening beyond observation.

Torchia D. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar) for the helices and the calcium-binding site but decreased for a few residues at the N and C termini. Heteronuclear NOEs could not be determined reliably for residues Ser-37 and Thr-38 due to the line broadening. The principle components of the inertia tensor computed for the cNTnC structure were (0.81:0.85:1), which implies that the overall rotational diffusion can be regarded approximately isotropic. Furthermore, the ratio of R 2/R 1 for the helices did not vary significantly, which also implies an approximately isotropic rotational diffusion characterized by τm = 7.7 ns. Therefore we considered the analysis of relaxation data in terms of the commonly used Lipari-Szabo model-free spectral density (26Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4558Crossref Scopus (3409) Google Scholar) reasonable. First the simple model was used with the order parameter (S2) as the only free parameter. Subsequently, the time constant τe for the fast internal motion was allowed to vary as well. In this way a statistically good fit was obtained for the majority of the residues. For the residues in the helices and in the calcium binding site S2 is approximately 0.9. The extended model in which the internal motion is divided into two components (31Clore G.M. Szabo A. Bax A. Kay L.E. Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 4989-4991Crossref Scopus (972) Google Scholar) resulted for the residues at the N and C termini (2–8 and 86–91) in a statistically good fit. At the N and C terminiS2 drops rapidly (Fig. 4). For the remaining residues 20, 23, 25, 28, 30, 37–40, 48, 60, and 63–64, the conformational exchange contribution (R ex) was included in the analysis. For the residues 28, 37–40, 61, and 64, reliable values forS2 were not obtained due to the fast loss of transverse coherence. For comparisons to skeletal troponin C, the angle between helices A and B in cNTnC (135°) is approximately the same as that of apo-sNTnC (138°) but very different from that of 2·Ca2+-sNTnC (81°) (17Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagné S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The angle between the C and D helices (130°) is more similar to the corresponding angle in apo-sNTnC (145°) than to the angle in 2·Ca2+-sNTnC (78°). Owing to the comparatively large distance bounds of the few NOEs in the calcium binding site the angle between the C and D helices is subject to uncertainty which does not allow us to prove unambiguously differences between cNTnC and sNTnC. The relative orientations of the N, A, and D helices of cNTnC are similar to the corresponding orientations in both apo- and 2·Ca2+-sNTnC. In this NAD frame of reference the orientation of the B and C helices of cNTnC resemble more those of the apo-form than the two-calcium form of sNTnC. This is obvious from the DDMs computed from the families of structures in order to obtain unbiased comparisons (Fig. 5). In cNTnC the B helix is closer to (approximately 10 Å) the N and D helices than in 2·Ca2+-sNTnC. On the other hand the differences between cNTnC and apo-sNTnC are small; however, the cNTnC form appears slightly more compact (Fig. 5 B). The residue Val-28 not in the sNTnC sequence was excluded from the comparisons. For the sake of completeness a DDM was computed between apo- and 2·Ca2+-sNTnC (Fig. 5 C). The result is quite similar to the DDM between cNTnC and 2·Ca2+-sNTnC. These comparisons imply only minor conformational changes to be expected upon the calcium binding as already shown by Spyracopoulos et al.(18Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This may indeed be a fundamental property of cTnC, which enables the fast switching between apo and holo states necessary for the heart function. On the other hand, so far no high resolution structure has been obtained from a complex comprising the key parts of cardiac TnC and troponin I. The association of cTnC with troponin I may affect the degree of opening of cTnC upon calcium binding (18Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Qualitative comparisons with the structures of the avian (17Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagné S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and human (18Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) regulatory domains of cardiac TnC, reported just recently, reveal a high degree of similarity. Apparently the C35S and C84S mutations, used to prevent possible disulfide formation, in the avian cTnC study are immaterial for the overall structure. Nevertheless, we notice that NOEs between Ala-23 and Val-44 from the A and B helices, respectively, reported for the avian cTnC are absent in our NOE spectra. This could be explained by a small difference in the twist of the B helix with respect to the A helix between the human and avian cTnC. Furthermore, we notice some differences in the chemical shifts of certain NHs between our data and the data by Spyracopoulos et al. (18Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This is partly due to the slightly longer (1–91 amino acids) sequence used in the present study compared with the protein (1–89 amino acids) studied by Spyracopoulos et al. (18Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 caption). In addition NH chemical shifts depend on the concentration of TFE but we do not observe noticeable structural consequences. According to an earlier study on sTnC (33Slupsky C.M. Kay C.M. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7365-7375Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) the use of 15% TFE should prevent the dimerization involving the N-terminal domain. The lack of apparent variation in R 2/R 1 for the approximately globular tertiary structure of the cNTnC excludes the presence of specific dimers, but it may be that 9% of TFE used in the present study does not completely prevent a transient unspecified dimerization. Indeed our estimate of the overall correlation time (τm = 7.7 ns) based onR 2/R 1 (28Kay L.E. Torchia D. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar) appears somewhat high in comparison with values obtained for proteins of similar sizes. This leaves the possibility for the monomer-dimer exchange, which leads to an erroneous estimate for the τm and consequently also to a small systematic error in the values ofS2 assuming the isotropic model. The fast dynamics itself is unlikely to be affected by the dimerization (34Fushman D. Cahill S. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The monomer-dimer exchange is indistinguishable from a conformational exchange (34Fushman D. Cahill S. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the present study it appears more likely that the comparatively fast loss of the transverse coherence for residues 28, 37–40, 61, and 64 is caused by the conformational exchange rather than by the monomer-dimer exchange. These residues do not appear to form a contact surface. Evenäs et al. (35Evenäs J. Thulin E. Malmendal A. Forsén S. Carlström G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have studied a mutated C-terminal half of calmodulin, E140Q, and observed a conformational equilibrium between the open and closed forms with a population ratio close to 1:1. They observed the most pronounced effects on resonances from residues in the calcium binding loops. The strongest line broadening observed in the present work is for residues in the defunct calcium binding loop 37–40 and hydrophobic residues Val-28, Ile-61, and Val-64. Coincidentally, Val-64 is also the “hinge” about which the end of the C helix rotates relative to the NAD unit in sTnC (36Gagne S.M. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4386-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) as well as Glu-40 is the “hinge” about which the B helix reorients with respect to the NAD unit in cTnC (18Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is interesting to consider the possibility of an exchange between the closed form and a low population of the open state as an explanation for the line broadening. In particular because prior to the results by Sia et al. (17Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagné S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) a large conformational change similar to the one observed for sTnC was generally expected for cTnC. It was shown, for example, that upon a calcium titration the chemical shift of the methyl of Val-28 changes much (δCH3 = 0.16). In retrospect this significant change is probably explained by small movements of the nearby phenyls, because the structures of apo- and Ca2+-cNTnC are so similar (18Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the case of the mutant calmodulin two conformers were distinguished from a double set of mutually excluding NOEs. We find no clear evidence for a similar situation, which at least implies that the determined closed conformation of cNTnC has a population above 80–90%. A small population of the minor conformation could still cause the rapid transverse relaxation provided that the chemical shifts for the two conformations would differ significantly for instance due to ring current effects. A study of the structures of the apo and holo states of cNTnC in the presence of the binding peptide from TnI, now in progress, should settle if the presently known calcium-loaded closed conformation is truly the biologically relevant conformation of the regulatory domain of cardiac troponin C. The time-limiting step in muscle relaxation is most likely the release of calcium from the N-terminal half of troponin C. For free troponin C and calmodulin the off-rate of the Ca2+ ions from the regulatory sites is about 500 s−1 (3Li M.X. Gagne S.M. Tsuda S. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8330-8340Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of a binding peptide or drug this rate is dramatically reduced. For skeletal muscle with sTnC and smooth muscle with calmodulin, even a 100-fold reduction is acceptable, but not so for heart muscle. For the heart muscle to relax to about 90% in half a second the calcium off-rate has to be about 7 s−1. Maybe the cardiac TnC has developed to its present sequence with the defunct site to cope with the strict timing requirements, which can be more easily met with a somewhat weaker calcium binding. We thank Dr. L. E. Kay for providing pulse sequences for heteronuclear spectroscopy, Dr. A. Palmer for providing programs for dynamics calculations, and Dr. P. J. Fleming for making available the program for the difference distance matrix calculations."

To dissect these pathways further, the cellular effects induced by a Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, FGD1, have been examined. All exchange factors acting on the Rho GTPase family have juxtaposed Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. We report here that FGD1 triggers G1 cell cycle progression and filopodia formation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts as well as JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in COS cell transfection assays. FGD1-induced filopodia formation is Cdc42-dependent, and both the DH and PH domains are essential. Although expression of the FGD1 DH domain alone does not activate Cdc42 and induce filopodia, it does trigger both the JNK cascade in COS cells and G1 progression in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells. We conclude that FGD1 can trigger G1 progression independently of actin polymerization or integrin adhesion complex assembly. Furthermore, since FGD1 activates JNK and G1 progression in a Cdc42-independent manner, it must have additional, as yet unidentified, targets.

It is well established that Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, three members of the Rho family of small GTPases, control both the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and signal transduction pathways leading to gene transcription. In fibroblasts, Rho controls the assembly of actin stress fibers and associated focal adhesion complexes, whereas Rac and Cdc42 control the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively (1Ridley A.J.

In addition to these effects, the three GTPases have been reported to trigger a number of additional cellular activities, including activation of the JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, NF-κB activation, G1 cell cycle progression, and transcription from defined promoter elements upstream of the c-fos and cyclin D genes (5Coso O.A.

The biochemical relationship between these varied responses is not yet clear, but genetic analysis of dorsal closure in Drosophila strongly argues that the ability of Rac to coordinately control both the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and actin reorganization is physiologically important (11Glise B. Noselli S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of Rac and Cdc42 has revealed that stimulation of JNK activity and of actin polymerization is triggered by the interaction of each GTPase with two distinct target proteins (12Lamarche N.

Bar-Sagi D. van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In these studies, stimulation of G1 cell cycle progression correlated well with actin filament assembly, whereas JNK activation correlated well with activation of a Ser/Thr target kinase, p65PAK (12Lamarche N.

To dissect further the Cdc42-induced responses, we have now examined the cellular effects induced by an upstream regulator of Cdc42, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine.

Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Glover T.W. Wilroy R.S. Gorski J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The FGD1 gene product belongs to a family of some 15 GEFs active on members of the Rho GTPase family (19Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Like all members of the Rho GEF family, FGD1 contains a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a closely associated pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (16Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Glover T.W. Wilroy R.S. Gorski J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 19Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The DH domain encodes GEF catalytic activity and is required to stimulate GDP release from the GTPases. The function of the PH domain is unclear, although it has been suggested that it might serve to localize GEFs to discrete intracellular locations (19Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In this study, we have compared the effects of expressing FGD1 constructs containing either both the DH and PH domains or just the DH domain alone. We found that FGD1-DH can induce G1progression and activate the JNK cascade, but both the DH and PH domains are essential for Cdc42-dependent actin polymerization. This suggests that FGD1 can stimulate G1progression independently of its effects on the actin cytoskeleton and that FGD1 can activate JNK and G1 progression through Cdc42-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The following colleagues kindly provided the indicated constructs: Drs. M. Karin (University of California) and J. Ham (Eisai London Research Laboratories), pCMV-FLAG-JNK1 and pGEX-c-Jun, respectively; Dr. P. Aspenstrom (Uppsala University), pGEX-WASP-BD, an active Cdc42-binding domain (amino acids 201–321) of WASP (Wiscott-Aldrich syndromeprotein (20Aspenstrom P. Lindberg U. Hall A. Curr.

FGD1-DH (amino acids 375–560) and FGD1-PH (amino acids 561–710) were synthesized using the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pRK5 vector containing an Myc tag. FGD1-DH/PH (amino acids 375–710), an activated version of Cdc42 (L61Cdc42), and WASP-BD were also introduced into pRK5-Myc (17Olson M.F. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1628-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. NIH 3T3 focus assays were carried out using the NIH 3T3 subclone D4 (gift of C. J. Marshall) as described (22Toksoz D. William D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (23Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Plasmid amounts used were as follows: (i) 4 μg of pCMV-FLAG-JNK1 with 4 μg each of pRK5-Myc, pRK5-Myc-FGD1-DH/PH, pRK5-Myc-FGD1-DH, and pRK5-Myc-FGD1-PH or 1 μg of pRK5-Myc-L61Cdc42; and (ii) 5 μg of pRK5-Myc-PAK with 5 μg each of pRK5-Myc, pRK5-Myc-FGD1-DH/PH, and pRK5-Myc-FGD1-DH or 1.5 μg of pRK5-FLAG-L61Cdc42. pRK5-Myc-WASP-BD (3 μg) was cotransfected where indicated. JNK1 kinase activity in transfected COS-1 cell extracts was measured after immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody, using 0.4 μg of GST-c-Jun as a substrate (23Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The relative phosphorylation levels of c-Jun were determined by a Phospho-Imager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of immunoprecipitated JNK1 was evaluated on Western blots using M2 antibody and revealed by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected COS-1 cells were lysed, and p65PAK kinase activity was measured using myelin basic protein as a substrate as described (12Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The relative levels of myelin basic protein phosphorylation were determined by Phospho-Imager analysis. Levels of p65PAKimmunoprecipitated were checked by Western blotting with anti-p65PAK antibody (rabbit). Serum-starved quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared for microinjection as described (3Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). After microinjecting FGD1 expression constructs with or without 0.2 mg/ml GST-WASP-BD into the nucleus, cells were incubated for the indicated times. For detection of Myc-tagged FGD1 constructs and filamentous actin, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 for 1 h, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-phalloidin. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope. Confluent quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with DNA constructs and rat IgG as an injection marker and incubated with 10 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 40 h. Cells were fixed and stained for rat IgG to localize injected cells, and BrdUrd incorporation was monitored using anti-BrdUrd antibody (7Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Since many members of the Dbl family of Rho GEFs have been shown to behave as oncogenes, we first tested whether FGD1 or Cdc42 has transforming capability using an NIH 3T3 focus assay (22Toksoz D. William D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, transfection of FGD1 or L61Cdc42 into NIH 3T3 cells failed to induce focus formation under conditions where Lbc, a GEF specific for Rho, and L61Ras yielded characteristic transformed foci (22Toksoz D. William D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar). L61Rac induced foci, but only when cotransfected with Raf-CAAX, an activator of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (Fig. 1 A). Neither FGD1 nor L61Cdc42 induced foci when cotransfected with Raf-CAAX (Fig. 1 A). We conclude that FGD1 does not behave as an oncogene in this assay. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that FGD1 behaves as an oncogene in NIH 3T3 cells with regard to other parameters of transformation, such as growth in agar, tumor growth in nude mice, or serum-dependent growth. Indeed, it has recently been reported that Cdc42 can induce an anchorage-independent phenotype in Rat1 cells (24Qiu R.G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and it will be interesting to see whether FGD1 causes the same effects; this work is currently in progress. Cdc42 has also been shown to stimulate G1 cell cycle progression when introduced into quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells (7Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). To examine whether FGD1 can induce G1 progression and entry into S phase, an expression vector encoding the DH and PH domains of FGD1 (FGD1-DH/PH) was injected into the nuclei of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells, and DNA synthesis was monitored using BrdUrd incorporation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, FGD1-DH/PH induced G1progression and entry into S phase in ∼60% of injected cells. This is as efficient as constitutively active Cdc42 injections (7Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). To examine whether both the DH and PH domains are required, cells were also injected with the FGD1 DH domain alone (FGD1-DH). As shown in Fig. 1 B, FGD1-DH also triggered a signal leading to G1 progression in ∼60% of injected cells. FGD1-PH had no effect on BrdUrd incorporation. To determine whether FGD1-induced G1 progression is mediated by Cdc42, FGD1 was co-injected with an expression plasmid encoding the Cdc42-binding domain of WASP (WASP-BD). However, within 5 h after injection, WASP-BD-expressing cells began to retract, and by 16 h, almost all cells had detached (data not shown). We were therefore unable to assess the long-term effects of FGD1 on serum-starved cells depleted of Cdc42 activity. FGD1-DH/PH induces filopodia formation when expressed in quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells as shown in Fig. 2(panels a and b) (16Pasteris N.G. Cadle A. Logie L.J. Porteous M.E.M. Schwartz C.E. Stevenson R.E. Glover T.W. Wilroy R.S. Gorski J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To confirm that this is Cdc42-dependent, we co-injected FGD1 with WASP-BD. As shown in Fig. 2 (panels c and d), WASP-BD completely blocked FGD1-induced actin filament assembly, confirming that FGD1 induces filopodia through activation of Cdc42. Next, to determine whether both the DH and PH domains of FGD1 are required for this effect, we microinjected quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells with an expression vector encoding the DH domain alone (pRK5-Myc-FGD1-DH) and examined actin reorganization. As shown in Fig. 3 A (panels a and b), under conditions where FGD1-DH was expressed at the same level as FGD1-DH/PH (compare Fig. 3 A(panel a) with Fig. 2 (panel a)), the DH domain alone was unable to induce any actin filament assembly. FGD1-DH/PH and Cdc42 both induce integrin adhesion complexes associated with filopodia (3Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3734) Google Scholar, 17Olson M.F. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1628-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). FGD1-DH did not induce any integrin complex assembly (data not shown). We conclude that activation of Cdc42 is dependent on both the DH and PH domains of FGD1.Figure 3The PH domain of FGD1 is essential for filopodia formation. A, serum-starved subconfluent Swiss 3T3 cells were fixed 4 h after injection of nuclei with 0.1 mg/ml pRK5-Myc-FGD1-DH (panels a andb) or 0.1 mg/ml FGD1-DH-CAAX (panels c and d). Expressed FGD1-DH (panel a) and FGD1-DH-CAAX (panel c) were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence with 9E10 antibody. Actin filaments (panels b andd) were visualized with fluorescently tagged phalloidin. Between 50 and 100 cells were microinjected in each of three experiments. No cells expressing FGD1-DH or FGD1-DH-CAAXwere observed showing induced filopodia formation. The scale bar represents 20 μm. B, cells in a monolayer of epithelial Caco-2 cells were microinjected with pRK5-Myc-FGD1-DH (panel a) or pRK5-Myc-FGD1-DH-CAAX(panel b), and Myc-tagged FGD1 was visualized after 2 h with 9E10 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Recent experiments with Lbc, a Rho-specific GEF, have revealed that its PH domain is not required for G1 progression or actin stress fiber assembly, at least when overexpressed in cells (25Olson M.F. Sterpetti P. Nagata K. Toksoz D. Hall A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas for Tiam-1, a Rac-specific GEF, an intact PH domain is required for both actin polymerization and JNK activation (26Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 27Wang D.S. Deng T. Shaw G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The role of the PH domain is therefore not clear, but it has been suggested that it might play a role in localizing exchange factors to the correct intracellular location, presumably the plasma membrane in the case of Cdc42 and Rac. In agreement with this, some PH domains have been shown to interact with phospholipids, which could act as a signal for translocation to the plasma membrane (28Lemmon M.A. Falasco M. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 237-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To test whether the role of the PH domain of FGD1 is to induce plasma membrane localization, we added the “CAAX box” plasma membrane-localizing motif to the C terminus of FGD1-DH and analyzed the effects of this construct on the actin cytoskeleton. As shown in Fig. 3 A(panels c and d), FGD1-DH-CAAX did not induce any actin filament assembly. To confirm that FGD1-DH-CAAX localizes to the plasma membrane, the construct was expressed in the epithelial cell line Caco-2 since it is very difficult to see plasma membrane localization in the flat fibroblast cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, expressed FGD1-DH (panel a) was found predominantly in the cytosol of Caco-2 cells, whereas FGD1-DH-CAAX (panel b) clearly localized to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the role of the FGD1 PH domain is unlikely to be simply that of a plasma membrane targeting signal. Perhaps the PH domain is required for the recruitment of other components of the Cdc42 signaling machinery. Analysis of Cdc42 pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, revealed that Cdc24, the GEF for Cdc42, also interacts with Bem1, a scaffold-like protein (29Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cdc24 therefore appears to be part of a large signaling complex and may have other roles in addition to its Cdc42 GEF activity. FGD1 has previously been shown to act as a GEF for Cdc42 and to activate the JNK1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (17Olson M.F. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1628-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Zheng Y. Fischer D.J. Santos M.F. Tigyi G. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33169-33172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cdc42 interacts with and activates a Ser/Thr kinase, p65PAK, and this has been suggested to mediate activation of JNK (12Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 13Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. van Aelst L.

To determine whether FGD1 can activate p65PAK, wild-type p65PAK and FGD1 were cotransfected into COS-1 cells. Fig. 4shows that under conditions where L61Cdc42 activated p65PAK∼12-fold, the FGD1-DH/DH and FGD1-DH constructs did not activate p65PAK. Under these conditions, a constitutively activated p65PAK (PAK-LF) had ∼62-fold increased activity compared with the wild type (Fig. 4). We conclude that FGD1-mediated activation of the JNK pathway previously reported is unlikely to be via p65PAK. To analyze the role of Cdc42 in FGD1-induced JNK activation more carefully, we examined the effect of cotransfecting FGD1 with WASP-BD. As a control and to show the effectiveness of this approach, Fig. 5 A shows that WASP-BD completely inhibited the ability of L61Cdc42 to induce JNK activation. However, as shown in Fig. 5 B, WASP-BD only partially blocked JNK activation by FGD1-DH/PH. Furthermore, Fig. 5 B shows that the FGD1 DH domain alone was capable of activating the JNK pathway and that this was resistant to coexpression of WASP-BD. FGD1-PH itself did not activate JNK (data not shown). We conclude that in addition to a Cdc42-dependent activation of JNK, FGD1 can stimulate a Cdc42-independent pathway leading to JNK activation and that this pathway depends only on the DH domain and not the PH domain of FGD1 (Fig. 6). The nature of this additional pathway is unclear, although one obvious possibility is that FGD1 can act as a GEF for other Rho family GTPases. We have already shown that neither Rho nor Rac is a target for FGD1 (Fig. 2 (panel d) and Ref. 17Olson M.F. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1628-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We have also found that an activated RhoD (33Murphy C. Saffrick R. Grummt M. Gournier H. Rybin V. Rubino M. Auvinen P. Lutcke A. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 384: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) does not activate JNK in COS cell transfections and that a dominant-negative RhoD does not interfere with FGD1-induced JNK activation (data not shown). We are currently examining other known members of the mammalian Rho GTPase family.Figure 6FGD1 mediates Cdc42-dependent and -independent signal transduction pathways.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In conclusion, FGD1 acts as an exchange factor for Cdc42, and when overexpressed in cells, it can induce filopodia formation, G1 progression, and JNK activation. Activation of Cdc42 requires both the DH and PH domains of FGD1, but expression of the FGD1 DH domain alone activates JNK and stimulates G1progression. It therefore appears that FGD1-induced changes to the actin cytoskeleton are Cdc42-dependent, but that FGD1-induced effects on gene transcription are mediated by both Cdc42-dependent and -independent signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2091880825,"The 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin from Chromatium vinosum arises as one prominent member of a recently defined family of proteins found in very diverse bacteria. The potentiometric circular dichroism titrations of the protein and of several molecular variants generated by site-directed mutagenesis have established that the reduction potentials of the two clusters differ widely by almost 200 mV. This large difference has been confirmed by electrochemical methods, and each redox transition has been assigned to one of the clusters. The unusually low potential center is surprisingly the one that displays a conventional CX1 X2CX3 X4C (Xn, variable amino acid) binding motif and a structural environment similar to that of clusters having less negative potentials. A comparison with other ferredoxins has highlighted factors contributing to the reduction potential of [4Fe-4S] clusters in proteins.

These findings set the framework in which previous observations on ferredoxins can be better understood. They also shed light onto the possible occurrence and properties of very low potential [4Fe-4S] clusters in less well characterized proteins. [4Fe-4S] clusters are present in a wide variety of proteins; they are often coordinated to amino acids organized in characteristic motifs (1Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar) corresponding to protein domains, sometimes identified by x-ray crystallography (see Ref. 2Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Sieker L.C. Meyer J. Moulis J.-M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16065-16073Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and references therein). A pair of [4Fe-4S] clusters is found in many bacterial ferredoxins (3Otaka E. Ooi T. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 26: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and other electron transfer proteins and enzymes (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 4Quinkal I. Davasse V. Gaillard J. Moulis J.-M. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In most cases these clusters are bound to the proteins through a pair of CXXCXXC … CP (X, variable amino acid) motifs containing all necessary cysteine ligands. Extensive work on the simplest ferredoxins over the last 35 years has established that the two clusters are relatively close, at a distance of approximately 10 Å thus enabling them to interact magnetically, and that they display similar reduction potentials, generally around −400 ± 100 mV (normal hydrogen electrode). Until now, these generic properties have not been conclusively challenged in any fully characterized molecule containing such 2[4Fe-4S] domains. Proteins with homologous coordinating motifs are known in which one of the [4Fe-4S] clusters is substituted by a [3Fe-4S] center, often as a result of the loss of one of the cysteine ligands (5Stout G.H. Turley S. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1020-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Consequently, these proteins exhibit properties that are clearly different from those of molecules containing two [4Fe-4S] centers (6Beinert H. Thomson A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 333-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Recently, the 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin from the purple sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Chromatium vinosum has been further investigated (7Huber J.G. Gaillard J. Moulis J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), following its initial characterization (8Bachofen R. Arnon D.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 120: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), in an effort to assess the influence of specific sequence elements (including a 6-amino acid insertion between two cysteine ligands and a long C-terminal extension) on the properties of the [4Fe-4S] clusters. It was found that, in contrast to other 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins without these elements, the electronic communication between the two clusters was apparently impaired (7Huber J.G. Gaillard J. Moulis J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The gene encoding C. vinosumferredoxin (CvFd) 1The abbreviations used are: CvFd,Chromatium vinosum ferredoxin; Cp, Clostridium pasteurianum. 1The abbreviations used are: CvFd,Chromatium vinosum ferredoxin; Cp, Clostridium pasteurianum. was later cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (9Moulis J.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the structure of the protein was determined (10Moulis J.-M. Sieker L.C. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These studies provide the necessary background for exploring the structure-function relationships in CvFd by protein engineering, and this report presents our initial efforts toward this aim.The properties of Fe-S clusters can be probed by a number of spectroscopic methods. The absorption spectra are generally broad as they result from overlapping charge transfer bands in the visible-near UV range. The resolution of these spectra can be significantly improved by the implementation of circular dichroism (CD) which provides both a characteristic pattern for each cluster type and a sensitive monitor of changes affecting either the cluster or the protein (11Stephens P.J. Thomson A.J. Dunn J.B.R. Keiderling T.A. Rawlings J. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The use of the method as an accurate analytical tool is broadened when the CD spectra of electron transfer proteins can be monitored as a function of the applied potential (12Link T.A. Hatzfeld O.M. Unalkat P. Shergill J.K. Cammack R. Mason J.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7546-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, both a measure of the reduction potential and an estimate of the structural changes induced by the addition or removal of electrons are then provided.The results of such studies, together with direct electrochemical measurements, are reported herein for CvFd and a series of molecular variants. The comparison with the well characterized 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum (CpFd) reveals that the [4Fe-4S] clusters in CvFd display unusual redox properties which help explain previously observed differences between these proteins (7Huber J.G. Gaillard J. Moulis J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These data also provide unprecedented compelling evidence that the protein domains containing two [4Fe-4S] clusters found in widely different biological systems do not always display similar physicochemical and functional properties.RESULTSMolecular Variants of CvFdFig. 1 highlights the targets for site-directed mutagenesis investigated in CvFd. The first set of variants involves modifications of the protein environment around cluster II which is coordinated by Cys-18, Cys-37, Cys-40, and Cys-49. In the variant referred to as Δ1 the loop (residues 41–48) between two of the cysteine ligands of cluster II (10Moulis J.-M. Sieker L.C. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has been replaced by two residues (Ala-Gln), therefore converting the sequence to a more conventional binding motif (CXXCAQC … CP) for [4Fe-4S] clusters. In the K74− variant, half (residues 74–82) of the C-terminal α-helix has been removed. In Δ1K74− the two modifications were combined, and in K74E the buried hydrophilic side chain of lysine (10Moulis J.-M. Sieker L.C. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has been substituted by glutamic acid. In two more variants, Y44C and Y44S, residue Tyr-44 of loop Δ1 has been replaced by a cysteine or a serine.The second set of variants, namely D12G, V13G, and Y30F, contains single site replacements introduced close to cluster I which is coordinated by Cys-8, Cys-11, Cys-14, and Cys-53.Circular Dichroism SpectroscopySince CvFd apparently deviates from other 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins in its ability to convey intramolecular electron transfer between its clusters (7Huber J.G. Gaillard J. Moulis J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), evidence for unusual spectroscopic properties was sought using CD spectroscopy.CD Spectra and Electrochemical Titration of CpFdFor reference, the visible CD spectra recorded during the redox titration of native CpFd are shown in Fig. 2. These data qualitatively confirm and extend previous reports (11Stephens P.J. Thomson A.J. Dunn J.B.R. Keiderling T.A. Rawlings J. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20George S.J. Thomson A.J. Crabtree D.E. Meyer J. Moulis J.-M. New J. Chem. 1991; 15: 455-465Google Scholar). The spectra of the fully oxidized protein with [4Fe-4S]2+clusters contain several moderately intense features all over the spectral range shown. Upon reduction, a significant decrease in the intensity of all these bands occurs; at −600 mV a positive band with a maximum at 360 nm and a shoulder at 380 nm is the main feature of the spectrum (Fig. 2). In contrast, the far UV region (Fig. 3) shows little, if any, change in the relatively weak negative band around 200 nm. These observations are consistent with the lack of extensive secondary structure elements in clostridial ferredoxins (21Duée E.D. Fanchon E. Vicat J. Sieker L.C. Meyer J. Moulis J.-M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, they suggest that only small global structural changes are induced by adding one electron to each cluster.Figure 2CD-monitored electrochemical redox titration of CpFd (left) and CvFd (right). Spectra were recorded in an optically transparent thin layer electrode cell with a path length of 0.1 mm. Selected spectra at +90; −380 and −510 mV for CpFd and +100; −510; −610; −670 and −720 mV for CvFd (decreasing order of intensity at 412 nm, respectively) are shown. Theinsets contain Nernst curves calculated from the CD intensity at 412 nm and fitted with the following parameters: for CpFd,n = 1, E0 = −369 mV; for CvFd,n = 1, E01 = −492 mV, E02 = −663 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3CD spectra of CpFd (top) and CvFd (bottom) in the UV range.

The protein concentrations were 0.2 mm for CpFd and 0.15 mm for CvFd. The optical path length was 0.02 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The variation of the intensities of these peaks as a function of the applied potential provides a measure of the reduction potential (Fig. 2, inset). In agreement with previous studies (22Ke B. Bulen W.A. Shaw E.R. Breeze R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Stombaugh N.A. Sundquist J.E. Burris R.H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2633-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a single redox wave, with a midpoint potential of −369 ± 4 mV, is observed between −300 and −600 mV. Moreover, the disappearance of all spectral features associated with oxidized clusters indicates that the two clusters of this protein display the same potential, as expected from a number of previous experiments (24Sweeney W.V. Rabinowitz J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 139-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).CD Spectra and Electrochemical Titration of CvFdThe CD spectra of oxidized CvFd are almost identical to those of CpFd in the 300–800 nm range (Fig. 2). Therefore, the optical properties of the oxidized clusters of CvFd do not differ from typical [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters, such as those of CpFd (Fig. 2). Below 300 nm, however, significant changes between CpFd and CvFd are noticed (Fig. 3). The relatively intense negative band around 220 nm in CvFd is indicative of the presence of the α-helix evidenced in the x-ray structure of the protein (10Moulis J.-M. Sieker L.C. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This secondary structure element is absent in CpFd and has been found to produce different signatures when either the 2-turn loop or the α-helix are removed or modified in CvFd (not shown). Another difference between the two proteins occurs at 258 nm where a positive band is found in the spectra of CvFd but not in those of CpFd (Fig. 2).The reductive titration of CvFd proceeds as for CpFd with a general decrease of the CD intensity when the potential is lowered (Fig. 2). Between approximately −550 mV and −600 mV, no further significant decreases are observed (Fig. 2); a midpoint potential of −492 ± 8 mV can be calculated which agrees with values determined by electrochemical measurements (Ref. 25Smith E.T. Feinberg B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14371-14376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and see below) and redox titrations with dithionite (22Ke B. Bulen W.A. Shaw E.R. Breeze R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Stombaugh N.A. Sundquist J.E. Burris R.H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2633-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the CD spectra obtained at potentials lower than this transition retain part of the features of the oxidized spectra, in contrast to what was observed with CpFd (Fig. 2). The CD spectra of CvFd did not show any decrease in intensity even after maintaining potentials in the −500 to −600 mV range for more than 1 h. Only a further decrease in potential succeeded in bleaching the CD spectra in the visible range, giving a spectroscopic signature very much like that of reduced CpFd (Fig. 2). A second midpoint redox potential at −663 ± 20 mV could be calculated from the latter part of the titration curve (Fig. 2,inset).The spectral changes associated with the first and the second transitions differ significantly (Fig. 4). The prominent CD bands at 366 (negative) and 410 nm (positive) readily disappear during the first transition. The spectral features corresponding to the second transition at lower potential are less intense and compare with the intensity observed for ferredoxins having a single [4Fe-4S] cluster (11Stephens P.J. Thomson A.J. Dunn J.B.R. Keiderling T.A. Rawlings J. Rao K.K. Hall D.O. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A likely interpretation is that the interaction between the two [4Fe-4S] clusters, the closest metal atoms of which are less than 9 Å apart (2Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Sieker L.C. Meyer J. Moulis J.-M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16065-16073Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), contributes to the CD spectra of 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins; the pair of CD bands at 366 and 410 nm may therefore arise from exciton coupling between the strongest transitions observed in absorption spectra around 388 nm (Fig. 5) and assigned to S-Cys ⇒ Fe charge transfer bands (26Moulis J.-M. Meyer J. Lutz M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6605-6613Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the orientation (Fe-S-C-C and χ1 dihedrals) of one cysteine ligand (Cys-40) is different for oxidized Cp and CvFd (10Moulis J.-M. Sieker L.C. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); this may change the CD features of cluster II, coordinated by Cys-40, and may explain the spectral differences between CpFd and CvFd,i.e. the intensity of the band at 258 nm in the oxidized state and the relative intensities of the bands at 360 and 380 nm in the reduced states.Figure 4Difference CD spectra for the two redox transitions of CvFd.

Spectra were recorded at −200 mV, bold line; −600 mV, thin line; −730 mV, dotted line. The protein concentration was 0.8 mm; the optical path length was 0.1 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As in the case of CpFd the CD spectra of CvFd in the UV region remain qualitatively the same at different reduction levels (Fig. 3). This observation provides evidence that in both ferredoxins the structural changes associated with the redox interconversion of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters are minimal.At the end of the reductive titrations, increasing the potential to 0 mV restored the initial spectrum recorded for each fully oxidized protein, hence indicating that the observed changes are fully reversible and that the implemented experimental conditions are not harmful to the integrity of these 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins.Visible Absorption SpectroscopyIn order to sustain the above observations, the visible absorbance of CvFd was also monitored as a function of the applied potential. The decrease of absorbance at 425 nm is a measure of the degree of reduction of [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters, as the spectra of the reduced clusters are less intense than those of the oxidized ones (24Sweeney W.V. Rabinowitz J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 139-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the visible absorption spectra of oxidized (applied potential, E = −200 mV), partially (E= −600 mV), and fully reduced (E = −730 mV) CvFd. Dithionite appears as effective as electrochemical reduction at −600 mV (not shown) but does not provide the largest decrease in absorbance as judged by comparison with the spectrum recorded at −730 mV. Only the latter data agree with absorbance changes observed in a sample reduced by chloroplasts under illumination (8Bachofen R. Arnon D.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 120: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Thus, the above titrations carried out with CvFd strongly suggest that the protein displays two redox transitions. Qualitatively similar results were also obtained with molecular variants of CvFd, and all reduction potential values are listed in TableII. However, such results may be biased, for instance by the involvement of a kinetic barrier slowing down the reduction of one cluster and apparently shifting the midpoint potential of the redox transition. This possibility has been addressed by additional experiments.Table IIReduction potential of CvFd and molecular variants by CD titration and electrochemical studiesFerredoxinCD titrationCyclic voltammetrySquare wave voltammetryE 1E 2E 1E 2E 1E 2CpFd−369 ± 4aWithout salt.−392b0.15 m NaCl.−405b0.15 m NaCl.CvFd−492 ± 8aWithout salt.−663 ± 20aWithout salt.−461b0.15 m NaCl.−653b0.15 m NaCl.−453b0.15 m NaCl.−658b0.15 m NaCl.Δ1c0.2 m NaCl.≈−417dBroad anodic peak; the midpoint potential was estimated from the cathodic peak position.−640—eTwo overlapping peaks observed in this potential region.−663K74−c0.2 m NaCl.−431−654−439−654Δ1K74−c0.2 m NaCl.−402≈−651dBroad anodic peak; the midpoint potential was estimated from the cathodic peak position.−424—eTwo overlapping peaks observed in this potential region.Y44Cf0.4 m NaCl.−478 ± 6−627 ± 13aWithout salt.−471≈−653dBroad anodic peak; the midpoint potential was estimated from the cathodic peak position.−468—eTwo overlapping peaks observed in this potential region.D12G−482 ± 7aWithout salt.−586 ± 11−465b0.15 m NaCl.−621b0.15 m NaCl.−453b0.15 m NaCl.−619b0.15 m NaCl.V13Gf0.4 m NaCl.−478−601−475−600Y30Fb0.15 m NaCl.−463−659−458−663a Without salt.b 0.15 m NaCl.c 0.2 m NaCl.d Broad anodic peak; the midpoint potential was estimated from the cathodic peak position.e Two overlapping peaks observed in this potential region.f 0.4 m NaCl. Open table in a new tab Reduction Potentials by Cyclic and Square Wave VoltammetriesTypical voltammograms of native CpFd and CvFd are shown in Fig. 6. CpFd shows only a single transition at approximately −400 mV, whereas CvFd shows two transitions at approximately −460 and −655 mV. The strong intensity of the single wave of CpFd agrees with the above observation that both [4Fe-4S] clusters react at this potential. Control experiments, with mediator mixtures (methyl viologen and 4′,4“-dimethyl-1′,1”trimethylene-2′,2“-dipyridinium dibromide) in the absence of protein, were carried out and showed that there is only a minor contribution of the mediator mixture to the electrochemical signal in the presence of the protein (Fig. 6). The reduction potentials determined for all forms studied are listed in Table II. From this series of measurements, it appears that the more negative value of CvFd redox potential (−655 mV) is shifted in variants with substitutions in the vicinity of cluster I, i.e. D12G and V13G; in these molecules the potential with the less negative value (−460 mV) agrees with the value measured for the native protein. Conversely, shifts of the less negative but not of the more negative redox potential were observed in variants, such as Δ1, K74−, and Δ1K74−, structurally modified around cluster II. These data indicate that the redox transition at −460 mV (native CvFd) arises from cluster II and the lowest transition at −655 mV is due to cluster I. Proteins carrying the C-terminal truncation displayed partially broadened and split electrochemical signals, so that some potentials could not be determined reliably. This electrochemical behavior correlates with a decreased stability of these proteins which was also observed during the CD-monitored redox titrations and other experiments (not shown). No significant changes were found for Y30F, as already observed with similar variants of other ferredoxins (27Quinkal I. Kyritsis P. Kohzuma T. Im S.-C. Sykes A.G. Moulis J.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1295: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Figure 6Electrochemical characterization of CpFd and CvFd.

Cyclic voltammograms were taken at 25 °C and at a potential scan rate of 10 mV/s.

At high scan rates, the separation between the anodic and the cathodic peak increased with increasing scan rate; from this, the heterogenous electron transfer rate constant k0(28Nicholson R.S. Anal. Chem. 1965; 37: 1351-1355Crossref Scopus (2983) Google Scholar) could be estimated (Table III), assuming a diffusion coefficient D = 10−6cm2/s which is consistent with the observed peak current. Quite remarkably, different electrode kinetics were observed for cluster I (E m = −655 mV) and cluster II (E m = −460 mV); the heterogenous rate constant for the oxido-reduction of the latter was determined as approximately 4 × 10−3 cm/s, whereas the former showed reversible electrode kinetics up to scan rates of 0.5 V/s. Therefore, a lower limit of 2 × 10−2 cm/s was estimated for the heterogenous rate constant of cluster I in all variants studied. These values support the statement that no fast electron transfer takes place between the clusters (7Huber J.G. Gaillard J. Moulis J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); otherwise, oxidoreduction of both clusters could proceed rapidly via cluster I.Table IIIKinetics of reduction of native CvFd and molecular variantsFerredoxinHeterogenous electron transfer rate, k0 of cluster IIHomogeneous rate constant for the reduction (of cluster II) by dithionitecm/sm−1/2 s−1Native CvFd4 · 10−30.02Y30F(4–8) · 10−30.02Y44S0.03Y44C11 · 10−3D12G8 · 10−30.03K74E ≫0.2K74−3 · 10−3 ≫0.2Δ1>2 · 10−2 ≫0.2Δ1K74−>10−2 ≫0.2CpFd6 · 10−319aValue from data obtained by stopped-flow measurements (52).a Value from data obtained by stopped-flow measurements (52Lambeth D.O.

Open table in a new tab Electron transfer to cluster II is faster in the Δ1 and Δ1K74− forms in which it is comparable to electron transfer to cluster I. This result is consistent with dithionite reduction kinetics discussed below. The other structural changes studied in this work had less significant effects on the electron transfer kinetics except for Y44C which displayed an increased heterogenous rate constant by a factor of approximately 3-fold. It is conceivable that cysteine in this position facilitates electron transfer to and from cluster II by interacting with the gold electrode or that the removal of the aromatic ring makes cluster II more exposed.Surprisingly, the heterogenous rate constant determined for CpFd, which agrees with previously reported ones (29Van Dijk C. van Eijs T. van Leeuwen J.W. Veeger C. FEBS Lett. 1984; 166: 76-80Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30Armstrong F.A. Cox P.A. Hill H.A.O. Lowe V.J. Oliver B.N. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1987; 217: 331-366Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar), is closer to those of CvFd cluster II than to those of CvFd cluster I (Table III). This is another noteworthy difference between the latter and CpFd clusters, despite their structural similarity (10Moulis J.-M. Sieker L.C. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1765-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Effect of Ionic Strength and pHThe effect of ionic strength on the values of the reduction potential of native CvFd has been measured in solutions with NaCl concentrations up to 1 m. A linear relationship between the redox potential and the square root of the ionic strength was observed over the whole range studied with a slope of +35 mV/m0.5 for both clusters. The variation is similar to that obtained in previous studies on [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters in other proteins (23Stombaugh N.A. Sundquist J.E. Burris R.H. Orme-Johnson W.H. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2633-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The effect of pH has also been studied. At pH values equal to or below 6, the electrochemical response was not satisfactory in the implemented conditions. Although the ionic strength was not kept constant at the different pH values, the weak dependence with ionic strength observed at pH 7.5 dismisses a major contribution of this parameter. Only at pH values above 10 do the reduction potentials of both transitions significantly shift; these data may indicate the binding of hydroxide ions to the clusters and associated changes in their electronic properties. At these high pH values, structural modifications of the protein must also be considered. The case of cluster II is interesting because, in contrast to cluster I, this group displays an increase of the redox potential with increasing pH opposite to the effect of electrostatic repulsion between the [Fe4S4(Cys)4]2−/3−cluster and nearby deprotonated residues, such as His-43.Kinetics of Dithionite Reduction of CvFdFrom the comparison of the absorption spectra described above, dithionite appears to be able to reduce only cluster II in CvFd. The decrease with time of the absorbance at 425 nm has been analyzed as a pseudo first-order kinetic process; the rate constants calculated using the added dithionite concentration are listed in Table III. It is easily concluded that in the molecular variants missing either loop Δ1 or half of the C terminus α-helix, reduction of cluster"
https://openalex.org/W2150921691,"The maltose transporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is subject to rapid, irreversible inactivation in the presence of glucose. Loss of transport function was paralleled by a decrease in amount of transporter protein and most likely involves endocytosis and degradation of the protein in the vacuole. This (catabolite) inactivation of Mal61p was triggered not only by glucose but also by 2-deoxy-d-glucose, which cannot be metabolized beyond 2-deoxy-d-glucose phosphate. The signal that targets membrane proteins specifically for catabolite inactivation is unknown. To investigate whether or not specific modification of Mal61p triggers the inactivation, putative protein kinase A and C phosphorylation sites were removed, and the transport activities and levels of the mutant proteins upon addition of glucose were followed in time. Three Mal61p mutants, i.e. S295A, T363A, and S487A, exhibited significantly reduced rates of inactivation in the presence of glucose. Likewise, in wild-type Mal61p the rate of inactivation and degradation of the protein paralleled each other in the case of T363A. On the contrary, for the S295A and S487A mutants the rates of protein degradation were slowed down more profoundly than was the loss of transport activity. These observations indicate that (i) some form of modification (e.g. phosphorylation) of the protein precedes breakdown, (ii) the modification inactivates Mal61p, and (iii) the inactivation of Mal61p is not necessarily followed by proteolytic degradation.

The first step in maltose metabolism in yeast is performed by the maltose transport protein, which catalyzes the uptake of maltose in symport with one proton. Subsequently, 1,4-α-glucosidase (maltase) hydrolyzes internalized maltose into two molecules of glucose. Maltose fermenting strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have one or more MAL loci. Each locus comprises at least three genes,MALX1 encodes the maltose transport protein,MALX2 encodes the maltase, and MALX3 encodes an activator of MALX1 and MALX2 (Xdenotes one of five MAL loci, with X = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6) (1Needleman R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). MAL gene expression in maltose-fermenting “wild-type” strains is inducible and glucose-repressed. The latter phenomenon is mediated by the main glucose repression/derepression pathway, which constitutes the transcription factor Mig1p, at least one protein kinase (Snf1p), and several other proteins whose functions are unknown (2Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 3-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). While the main glucose repression/derepression pathway inhibits the synthesis of the proteins involved in the first steps of maltose metabolism, the presence of glucose activates a second mechanism involved in the inactivation (also termed catabolite inactivation) of the maltose transporter but not of maltase (3Lucero P. Herweijer M. Lagunas R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 168-265Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J.

The inactivation seems to be due to targeting of the protein to the vacuole, where it is proteolyzed (4Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Riballo E. Herweijer M. Wolf D.H. Lagunas R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5622-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lucero P. Lagunas R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 147: 273-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If sugar-respiring or -derepressed (grown on nonfermentable carbon sources) cells of S. cerevisiae are fed with glucose or other rapidly fermentable sugars such as fructose or sucrose, a number of metabolic changes occur very rapidly, including inhibition of gluconeogenesis (e.g. inactivation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and other gluconeogenic enzymes) and stimulation of glycolysis (activation of phosphofructokinase) (for review, see Ref. 2Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 3-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The RAS-adenylate cyclase pathway has been implicated in this metabolic switch, as the addition of the fermentable sugar (first messenger) causes a rapid, transient increase in the level of the second messenger cAMP, which in turn activates (specific) protein kinases. A role for cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activity in catabolite inactivation of the high affinity glucose and galactose transporters was suggested from studies in mutants with varying kinase activities (9Ramos J. Cirillo V.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3545-3548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies have been disputed more recently (10Riballo E. Mazon M.J. Lagunas R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 143-146Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), it has not been ruled out that phosphorylation of the transport protein forms the trigger for the controlled degradation of the protein. In this work, we have analyzed catabolite inactivation of Mal61p by mutating putative protein kinase A and C phosphorylation sites. We show that three putative phosphorylation sites, Ser-295, Thr-363, and Ser-487, play a role in catabolite inactivation of the maltose transporter. These comprise both putative protein kinase A and C sites. We also show that inactivation of the transport system and proteolytic degradation can be uncoupled.

Strains were grown in batch culture on YP medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone (pH 6.6)), supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose or 2% (w/v) maltose, or on minimal medium, containing per liter: 0.2 g of MgSO4, 3.0 g of NaH2PO4, 0.7 g of K2HPO4, 2.5 g of (NH4)2SO4 (pH 6.0), 1 ml of Vishniac solution, 1 ml of vitamin solution, 0.5% (w/v) maltose, and when appropriate 1 ml of uracil (40 mg/ml), l-leucine (125 mg/ml), l-histidine (20 mg/ml), or adenine (20 mg/ml). For growth in chemostat culture, the cells were grown in the minimal medium except that K2HPO4 was omitted and NaH2PO4 was replaced by 1 g of KH2PO4. Chemostat cultures were operated at a dilution rate of 0.1 h−1, at 30 °C and pH 5.0 (kept constant by titration with 1 m KOH). DNA manipulations in Escherichia coli were carried out in the strains JM101 (12Messing J. Recomb. DNA Tech. Bull. 1979; 2: 43-49Google Scholar) or DH5α (13Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar) as described previously (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed according to the protocol of Gietz et al. (15Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The plasmid YEpY18 (11van der Rest M.E. de Vries Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5440-5446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is a yeast multicopy plasmid carrying the MAL61 gene under control of the ADC1 promoter. A cassette gene ofMAL61 was constructed using mutagenic primers (see Table I) and YEpY18 DNA as a template for polymerase chain reaction-based synthesis of MAL61 fragments. Briefly, unique restriction sites were engineered by the polymerase chain reaction 400–500 base pairs apart (see Fig. 1 A), which allowed easy subcloning, mutagenesis, and sequencing of the appropriate fragments. The length of the fragment containing MAL61 in YEpY18 was reduced by digestion of a ScaI site 56 bases downstream the TGA stop codon of the MAL61 gene and a SmaI site in the plasmid, thereby reducing the size of the noncoding region by 900 bases. The resulting plasmid YEpY87 was used for mutagenesis of the predicted phosphorylation sites in Mal61p. Site-directed mutagenesis of the phosphorylation sites was carried out by the method of Kunkelet al. (16Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) after subcloning of the appropriate fragments in M13mp18, or, alternatively, by the polymerase chain reaction by using mutagenic oligonucleotides in combination with primers that hybridize at the unique restriction sites. Mutagenic primers are indicated in Table I.

Open table in a new tab Maltase activity was measured by following the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucoside (pNPG) 1The abbreviations used are: pNPG,p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucoside; 2-DOG, 2-deoxy-d-glucose. at 400 nm and at 30 °C. The reaction mixture consisted of 1 mm pNPG in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8. The reaction was started by the addition of cell-free extract to a final concentration of 60–70 μg of protein·ml−1; and stopped by the addition of 2 mNa2HCO3. Enzyme activity is expressed as micromoles of pNPG converted·min−1·mg of protein−1. Cell-free extract was prepared by vortexing 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 6.8)-washed cells for 4 min in the presence of glass beads (diameter, 0.23–0.33 mm). Whole cells and debris were removed by centrifugation (5 min; 13,000 ×g). Protein concentrations were determined in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) SDS using a modified Lowry assay (17Duley J.R. Grivee P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested from a chemostat culture and resuspended in an equal volume of minimal medium with or without NH4+ plus carbohydrate (see “Results”) and 12.5 μg/ml cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis (18Peinado J.M. Loureiro-Dias M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 856: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). (NH4)2SO4 was replaced by K2SO4 when appropriate. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C, and two 1-ml samples were taken every 10 min. One sample was used for immunodetection of Mal61p, and the other sample was used for determination of the initial rate of maltose uptake. The cells were washed once in buffer C (100 mm potassium citrate/PO4, pH 5.5) and concentrated 20-fold. Transport of maltose in whole cells was measured as described previously (11van der Rest M.E. de Vries Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5440-5446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at 30 °C using a final [14C-U]maltose concentration of 45 μm. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 8 m urea. Cell-free extract was obtained by vortexing five times, 1 min each, in the presence of glass beads (diameter 0.25–0.5 mm) with 1-min intervals on ice in between. Subsequently, the broken cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and whole cells and debris were removed by centrifugation (5 min; 6,000 × g). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) sheets by semidry electroblotting (19Kyhse-Anderson J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against a purified amino-terminal 6-histidine tag fusion protein (N-(His)6-Mal61p). The antibodies were purified by adsorption against cell-free extract of S. cerevisiae6001BΔ11 (11van der Rest M.E. de Vries Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5440-5446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and used at serum dilutions of 1:15,000. Primary antibodies were detected with a chemiluminescent detection system using CSPD™ as substrate (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Band intensities were quantified using laser scanning densitometry. The Mal61 protein of S. cerevisiae is phosphorylated in vivo (4Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the kinases responsible for this phosphorylation as well as the target sites are unknown. Potential phosphorylation sites located in the cytoplasmic part of the protein were searched for with the program “Prosite” from PC-GENE, and the corresponding residues were replaced by alanines. These residues include putative protein kinase C sites (Ser-295, Ser-317, and Ser-487) as well as a putative cAMP-dependent protein kinase A site (Thr-363) (Fig. 1). As a control the serine residue at position 311, with no predicted modification, was substituted for alanine. To facilitate genetic manipulation of MAL61, a cassette gene was constructed, containing unique restriction sites approximately every 400 base pairs (Fig. 1 A). The mutations creating the new restriction sites were silent (TableI), and the rate of maltose transport and the expression level of the cassette protein were comparable to that of wild-type Mal61p (results not shown). The cassette version ofMAL61 was used for further studies and the construction of putative phosphorylation site mutants. The process of catabolite inactivation is usually triggered by the addition of glucose (3Lucero P. Herweijer M. Lagunas R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 168-265Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Riballo E. Herweijer M. Wolf D.H. Lagunas R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5622-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study catabolite inactivation of the maltose transport protein ofS. cerevisiae in a genetically well defined background, the strain 6001BΔ11/YEpY87, expressing only Mal61p, was used in most experiments. Cells were grown in a maltose-limited chemostat, which ensures high levels of expression of Mal61p (11van der Rest M.E. de Vries Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5440-5446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested from the chemostat and at time 0, the cells were shifted to a minimal medium containing glucose and no ammonia. To ensure complete inhibition of protein synthesis, cycloheximide was added to the inactivation medium (18Peinado J.M. Loureiro-Dias M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 856: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The activity of Mal61p was estimated from the initial rate of uptake of radioactive maltose, added at a low concentration (45 μm) in order to minimize effects of maltose metabolism. The activity of the maltase was followed by the release of 4-nitrophenol from pNPG. Fig. 2 shows that under these conditions the maltase activity decreased less than 10% over a period of 3 h, whereas the maltose transport activity was reduced more than 85% within 1 h. The t½ of inactivation of Mal61p-mediated maltose transport activity was 19 min. Maltose transport in the strain 6001B, expressing the MAL11 gene, inactivates in the presence of glucose with at½ of 40 min (TableII). This indicates variations in catabolite inactivation among naturally occurring homologs of Mal61p. Extracts of 6001BΔ11(YEpY87) cells withdrawn at different time intervals after the medium shift were also analyzed for the presence of the Mal61 protein by immunoblotting. It appeared that loss of maltose uptake activity was paralleled by loss of Mal61p cross-reactivity on immunoblots (Table II). Similar results were obtained with Mal61 protein, which carried an amino-terminal 6-histidine tag (N-(His)6-Mal61p). This construct will be described elsewhere.Table IIGlucose-induced inactivation rate of wild-type and mutant maltose transport proteinsStrainMaltose transport proteint 1/2 of initial maltose uptake activityt 1/2 of Mal61p breakdownmin600 1BΔ11/YEpY87Mal61p21.8 ± 4.0 (n = 5)206001BΔ11/YEpY107N-(His)6-Mal61p23.3 ± 1.2 (n = 3)26.7 ± 3.4 (n = 3)6001BΔ11/YEpY105Mal61p-S295A34.4 ± 4.5 (n = 5)No decrease during 120 min (n = 2)6001BΔ11/YEpY114Mal61p-S295A, S311A, S317A42No decrease during 60 min6001BΔ11/YEpY120Mal61p-S311A21NDaND, not determined.6001BΔ11/YEpY117Mal61p-S317A20ND6001BΔ11/YEpY130Mal61p-S295A, S311A, S317A, T363ANo growth in chemostatND6001BΔ11/YEpY125Mal61p-T363A44.3 ± 4.9 (n = 3)48.0 ± 3.0 (n = 2)6001BΔ11/YEpY140Mal61p-S487A41.0 ± 3.0 (n = 2)65.0 ± 0 (n = 2)6001BMal11p38.3 ± 0.5 (n = 3)NDCells were grown in a maltose-limited chemostat.

Open table in a new tab Cells were grown in a maltose-limited chemostat. At time 0, cells were harvested and resuspended in a nitrogen-deficient medium containing 2% glucose plus 12.5 μg/ml cycloheximide, and transport of [14C]maltose was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods”; t 1/2 values of inactivation were derived from plots of log activity versus time (see Fig. 3), and they represent the average ± S.D. for n independent experiments. AllMAL61 genes with mutations at Ser-295, Ser-311, Ser-317, Thr-363, and Ser-487 as well as the triple mutant S295A,S311A,S317A were able to complement S. cerevisiae 6001BΔ11 for growth on maltose, and could be grown in a maltose-limited chemostat. The maltose transport rates catalyzed by the mutated maltose transporters were comparable to the rate catalyzed by wild-type Mal61p (5.3 ± 2.0 nmol maltose·min−1·mg−1 of protein). In Fig. 3 catabolite inactivation of Mal61p (wild type) is compared with the inactivation of Mal61p-S295A, Mal61p-S311A, and the triple mutant, Mal61p-S295A,S311A,S317A. The putative phosphorylation site at residue 295 is present in transporters from prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, whereas the sites at 311 and 317 are much less conserved (Fig. 1 B). Wild-type Mal61p was inactivated significantly faster than the single Mal61p-S295A and the triple Mal61p-S295A,S311A,S317A mutant. The initial rate of maltose uptake of Mal61p decreased to 50% within 20 min, whereas it took 30–35 min for the Ser-295 mutant to reach the same extent of inactivation (Table II). The mutant Mal61p-S311A showed no apparent protection against inactivation and had a t½ similar to the wild type. The mutants of Thr-363 and Ser-487 also displayed half-lifes in the presence of glucose that were about twice that of wild-type Mal61p (Table II). The quadruple Mal61p-S295A,S311A,S317A,T363A mutant was not able to complement the 6001BΔ11 strain for growth in a maltose-limited chemostat, although this mutant was able to complement for growth in batch. Immunoblots showed that in wild-type Mal61p the decrease in the level of maltose transport protein occurred at a rate that was similar to the decrease in maltose transport activity (Fig. 4, Table II). This was also true for the T363A mutant. However, the Mal61p-S487A mutant protein disappeared more slowly, the t½ of disappearance of the protein was 65 min compared to a t½ of 44 min for the decrease in maltose transport activity. In the S295A and the triple mutant, no significant decrease of the protein was observed. These results show that in the T363A mutant both the decrease in maltose uptake activity and the proteolytic degradation of Mal61p are retarded similarly, whereas in the S295A and S487A mutants the loss of a putative phosphorylation site has a more profound effect on the degradation than on the inactivation. Since phosphorylation of a serine introduces a negative charge at that position, the effect of phosphorylation might be mimicked by changing the serine to a negatively charged residue. In case of the Ser-295 to glutamate substitution this could result in an increased inactivation rate of Mal61p. Consistent with an enhanced inactivation (degradation) rate of the protein, the Mal61p-S295E mutant was unable to complement 6001BΔ11 for growth on maltose (not shown). However, when this mutant was expressed in a strain with a defect in the END3 gene, which is necessary for endocytosis, low but significant maltose uptake was observed (Fig. 5). This suggests that in wild-type strains this mutant is subject to rapid “unregulated” endocytosis, which reduces the concentration of Mal61p molecules in the plasma membrane. To estimate the half-life of the maltose transport protein in the absence of glucose, cells were shifted to a medium containing maltose, galactose, or ethanol instead of glucose. After a shift to maltose or galactose, the transport activity did not decrease, but actually increased. The maltose uptake activity remained virtually the same with a t½ >5 h when cells were shifted to medium containing ethanol (Table III, Fig. 6). A shift to a medium containing 2% glucose plus ammonia yielded at½ of 25 min (Table III), which indicates that omission of ammonia does not have a significant effect on the inactivation rate. Overall, these results indicate that the intrinsic degradation rate of Mal61p in the absence of glucose is very slow and that inactivation of the protein is specifically triggered by glucose and not by the presence of a fermentable substrate in general. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (a nonmetabolizable analogue of glucose) was also capable of triggering catabolite inactivation of the maltose transporter (Table III). This suggests that glucose does not have to be metabolized beyond glucose 6-phosphate to trigger catabolite inactivation.Table IIIFactors affecting catabolite inactivation of Mal61pInactivation mediumt 1/2 of inactivation min2% Glucose −NH4+21.8 ± 4.0 (n = 5)2% Glucose +NH4+252% 2-DOG −NH4+23500 μm Maltose +NH4+No inactivation2% Galactose −NH4+No inactivation2% EtOH −NH4+No inactivation (n = 2)Strain 6001BΔ11/YEpY87 cells were grown in a maltose-limited chemostat.

At time 0 cells were harvested and resuspended in a medium plus 12.5 μg/ml cycloheximide with or without nitrogen (NH4+, as indicated) and containing sugar at the concentration indicated; further details are the same as described in the legend to Table II. Finally, Medintz et al. (4Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed that inactivation of Mal61p was dependent on growth conditions, i.e. the protein inactivated more rapidly in nitrogen-starved medium than in rich medium. Since their experiments were carried out with batch-grown cells, whereas ours were done with cells harvested from maltose-limited continuous cultures, we also analyzed the inactivation (decrease in transport activity) of Mal61p and Mal61p-S295A in batch-grown cells. The inactivation rates in batch were reduced to 16 min for wild-type Mal61p and 23 min for the Mal61p-S295A mutant. In the case of Mal11p the effect was even larger with a t½ of 38 min for cells from a continuous culture and 16 min for batch-grown cells. The expression levels of Mal61p in batch-grown cells were too low to estimate protein degradation accurately (data not shown). Overall these results indicate that the kinetics of inactivation of Mal61p strongly depends on the growth conditions and that the differences in catabolite inactivation between wild-type and mutant proteins are larger in slow growing cells in the chemostat (D = 0.1 h−1) than in exponentially growing batch cells (μmax ≈ 0.3 h−1). The maltose transport protein belongs to a family of proteins from prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic origin, of which the members transport different sugars, i.e. MalX1p and Agt1p, maltose; HxtXp and HepG2, glucose; Gal2p, galactose; Lac12p, lactose; XylE, xylose; and AraE, arabinose (Fig. 1 B) (20Henderson P.J.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 525-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B depicts the sequence comparison of the large cytoplasmic loop between putative transmembrane helices VI and VII found in members of this family. This region contains three of the four predicted phosphorylation sites studied here, i.e. Ser-295, Ser-317, and Thr-363. We show that substitution of Ser-295, Thr-363, or Ser-487 for alanine has a dramatic effect on glucose-induced inactivation of the maltose transport protein. The triple-mutant Mal61p-S295A,S311A,S317A has the same inactivation time as the single S295A mutant. The T363A mutation caused a similar increase in the half-life of inactivation and Mal61 protein stability, increasing to about twice that of wild-type Mal61p. The S295A and S487A mutations also doubled the inactivation rate, but in these mutants the decrease in protein levels was affected more strongly. The half-life of Mal61p-S487A was about three times that of wild-type Mal61p, whereas no significant decrease in Mal61p-S295A was observed. This finding indicates that inactivation and degradation of Mal61p can be uncoupled and that some form of modification (e.g. phosphorylation) of the protein precedes the breakdown. Mal11p has an inactivation rate in the presence of glucose of 38 min, which is comparable to the inactivation rate of the Mal61p-S295A, Mal61p-T363A and Mal61p-S487A mutants. Partial sequencing of the MAL11 gene revealed that Ser-295, Thr-363, and Ser-487 are present in Mal11p, and the increased inactivation time of Mal11p must therefore be caused by other differences in primary sequence of Mal11p and Mal61p. The overall identity between the two proteins is about 95%. 2T. H. C. Brondijk, unpublished results. Catabolite inactivation is not only induced by glucose but also by 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DOG). This compound is transported by the glucose transport systems and is readily phosphorylated by yeast hexokinases into 2-DOG-6-phosphate, but it is not metabolized further (21Novak S. D'Amore T. Russel I. Stewart G.G. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1990; 6: 149-156Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The catabolite inactivation triggered by 2-DOG is reminiscent to the activation of the RAS-cAMP pathway for which metabolism of glucose beyond glucose 6-phosphate is not needed for induction of the cAMP signal (2Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 3-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is also possible that transport of glucose is not required for catabolite inactivation and that external glucose or 2-DOG is sensed by specific receptors in the plasma membrane such as Snf3 or Rgt2 proteins as is the case for glucose repression (22Özcan S. Dover J. Rosenwald A.G. Wolf S. Johnston M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12428-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 23Walsh M.C. Scholte M. Valkier J. Smits H.P. Van Dam K.

When cells are shifted to a medium containing galactose, maltose or ethanol instead of glucose, maltose transport activity does not decrease but, in the case of maltose and galactose, increases somewhat. Since protein synthesis is completely inhibited in these cells,2 the increase in the presence of maltose and galactose must reflect an increase in specific activity of the transporter protein. The steady state maltose concentration in the chemostat was approximately 100 μm, 3M. E. van der Rest, unpublished results. and a switch to a medium containing a higher concentration of sugar (galactose or maltose) may enable the cells to generate more metabolic energy in the form of ATP as well as a higher proton motive force. This higher proton motive force could be the reason for the increase in transport activity. The concentration of maltose in the inactivation medium was deliberately kept low (at 500 μm) in order to avoid substrate induced lysis, as a result of unbridled uptake of maltose (25Postma E. Verduyn C. Kuiper A. Scheffers W.A. Van Dijken J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 171: 3539-3544Google Scholar), but it was higher than the steady state maltose concentration in the chemostat. In addition to Ser-295, Ser-317, and Ser-487, there are two other protein kinase C phosphorylation sites predicted in Mal61p. One in the N terminus at position 83 and one in the C terminus at position 572 (Fig. 1 A). These sites have been removed by an internal deletion at the N terminus and by deletion of the C terminus from amino acid 572. Although plasmids carrying these mutations are able to partially complement the S. cerevisiae strain 6001BΔ11 for growth on maltose in batch, it was not possible to propagate these strains in the chemostat using conditions described for the wild type (results not shown). The S295E mutant was made in order to introduce an acidic residue (negative charge) at a putative phosphorylation site relevant for catabolite inactivation. We speculate that continuous nonregulated inactivation of the S295E mutant forms the major cause for the inability of the cells to grow on maltose. This is supported by the observation that significant maltose uptake activity was measured when the Mal61p-S295E mutant was expressed in a strain defective in endocytosis (26Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We showed that mutation of both putative protein kinase C (Ser-295 and Ser-487) and protein kinase A (Thr-363) phosphorylation sites have an effect on catabolite inactivation of the maltose transporter. It should be stressed, however, that protein kinase A and C recognition sites cannot unequivocally be assigned (in fact they may overlap) (27Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), which leaves quite some room for speculation about the kinase involved in catabolite inactivation. Glucose addition to glucose-starved cells mediates not only a transient increase in cAMP, thereby activating protein kinase A (RAS-cAMP pathway), but it also leads to an increase of the intracellular Ca2+ levels (28Roomans G.M. Theuvenet A.P.R. Van den Berg Th. P.R. Borst-Pauwels G.W.F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 551: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Eilam Y. Othman M. Halachmi D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2537-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since protein kinase C is stimulated by Ca2+, the intracellular concentration of this inorganic cation could mediate catabolite inactivation as well. It is possible that, in analogy with the Ste2p G protein-coupled plasma membrane receptor, phosphorylation of the maltose transport protein at one or more residues precedes subsequent ubiquitination of the protein (30Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of the target protein is suggested to function as the endocytosis signal for Ste2p (30Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Involvement of ubiquitination in the catabolite inactivation of maltose transport has recently also been suggested (8Lucero P. Lagunas R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 147: 273-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One could speculate that phosphorylation of Mal61p at specific sites alters the local structure through which those regions become accessible for ubiquitination. Catabolite inactivation of the maltose transporter in yeast was also described in recent publications by Riballo et al. (5Riballo E. Herweijer M. Wolf D.H. Lagunas R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5622-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Medintz et al. (4Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Lucero and Lagunas (8Lucero P. Lagunas R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 147: 273-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of catabolite inactivation reported by Riballo et al. (5Riballo E. Herweijer M. Wolf D.H. Lagunas R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5622-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is quite different from that described here and also differs from the data of Medintz et al. (4Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Not only the half-life of inactivation is different (60 min versus 20 min in our study) but also the response to glucose is delayed up to 1 h in some experiments (5Riballo E. Herweijer M. Wolf D.H. Lagunas R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5622-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cause of this lag phase is not understood, but could be related to the use of less well defined S. cerevisiae strains and/or protein synthesis in the first hour of inactivation. The Lagunas group (8Lucero P. Lagunas R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 147: 273-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has also observed that the kinetics of inactivation varies among strains, which makes it difficult to compare the data on catabolite inactivation. Moreover, the strains used by Riballo et al., carry the multicopy plasmid pRM1-1, which specifies the MAL1 locus, and the cells are grown in batch culture (5Riballo E. Herweijer M. Wolf D.H. Lagunas R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5622-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have observed that the half-life of Mal11p activity in the presence of glucose is longer than that of Mal61p (Table II), whereas the growth conditions (batch versus chemostat) strongly affect the kinetics of catabolite inactivation of maltose transport. Medintz et al. (4Medintz I. Jiang H. Han E.K. Cui W. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported catabolite inactivation of maltose transport with two kinetic components,i.e. one with a half-life of about 20 min and one with at½ of about 1 h (in nitrogen starvation medium); only the latter is claimed to be associated with degradation of the protein. These authors interpreted the rapid inactivation as the result of a modification (phosphorylation) of the transporter. Our studies confirm this notion as the loss of transport protein is slower than the loss of transporter activity in both Mal61p-S487A and Mal61p-S295A."

Interestingly, the cell adherence to plastic substrate protected HL-60 cells from apoptosis induced with phorbol esters (29Solary E. Bertrand R. Pommier Y.

Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The principal mediator of apoptosis in these cases is ceramide, not sphingosine, but SPP could be equally effective in the protection of adherent HL-60 cells from phorbol ester-induced apoptosis.The several lines of experimental evidence summarized above suggested to us the following possibilities. 1) Apoptosis by sphingosine occurs by default (31Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar) in phorbol ester-treated HL-60 cells; 2) adherence to plastic by Mac-1 elicits an anchorage-dependent survival signal, and adherent cells may undergo anoikis by forced suspension (32Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar, 33Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar); 3) apoptosis in nonadherent cells and anoikis, as well, may be suppressed by the addition of SPP; and 4) if the commitment signal to apoptosis is lost faster than the survival signal, phorbol ester-differentiated and adherent HL-60 cells may de-differentiate and proliferate again by removing phorbol ester without perturbing the adherent state. Here we demonstrate that our model is substantiated by a line of experimental evidence that was obtained by studying adherent and suspended cell fractions separately after isolation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Drug TreatmentThe human acute myeloblastic leukemia cell line HL-60 (34Collins S.J.

Weinstein I.B. J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol. 1978; 1: 327-339PubMed Google Scholar). An ethanol stock solution of PDB (0.2 mm) was diluted before use to 10 μm with the culture medium and added to a cell culture of 5 × 105 cells/ml at a final concentration of 100 nm(4Oda T. Kitajima K. Hirano T. Shimizu N. Utiyama H. Int. J. Hematol. 1993; 58: 125-128PubMed Google Scholar). In using sphingolipids as effectors, cells in logarithmic growth were first precultured for 24 h in a serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml) and transferrin (5 μg/ml) and treated with drugs in the same medium (30Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 39Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). An ethanol stock solution (10 mm) ofN,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS; Biomol) was diluted with the serum-free medium before use. SPP (Biomol) was added as BSA complexes (39Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 125 μm in 4 mg/ml BSA (fatty acid-free). In suppression of anoikis of HL-60 cells with SPP, adherent cells prepared by pretreatment with 100 nmPDB for two days were detached by forced suspension by pipetting three times with the serum-free medium containing 20 μm SPP. PDB was removed from cells by washing three times with RPMI 1640 containing 5% FCS, and FCS was then removed by washing with serum-free medium. The cells were finally suspended in serum-free medium containing 20 μm SPP.Separation of Adherent and Nonadherent Cell PopulationsDuring the PDB treatment of HL-60 cells, suspended cells were separated by gentle pipetting. Culture dishes with the adherent cells were gently washed three times with 10 ml of fresh medium. A small number of cells contained in the wash fractions were discarded. The number of adherent cells were counted without suspending them from dishes by using an inverted microscope fitted with an ocular lens with grid, because the cells formed large aggregates after suspension. A unit area of the grid with an appropriate size was chosen so that a total of 200 or more adherent cells were contained in it. The cell density/unit area was measured at 8–16 different places selected at random in a dish. The total number of adherent cells/dish was estimated by multiplying the average cell density and the total area of a dish.Assay of Cell ProliferationTo a cell culture of 100 μl (3–10 × 105cells/ml), [3H]thymidine (55 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) was added to a final activity of 0.5 μCi/ml. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, the cells were washed 3 times and fixed on a slide glass. Autoradiography was done by immersing the slide glass in autoradiographic emulsion (type NR-M2; Konica, Tokyo, Japan) and exposing it for 4–6 days. Developed and fixed slides were counterstained with Giemsa, and more than 400 cells were counted under a light microscope. The labeling index was calculated from the number of cells with silver grains divided by the total cell counts.Assay of ApoptosisNuclear Fragmentation105 cells were fixed with an equal volume of 5% paraformaldehyde, neutralized by one-tenth volume of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and centrifuged onto a glass slide using a cytospin apparatus. The cells were further fixed in cold methanol (−20 °C, 5 min) followed by cold acetone (−20 °C, 5 min), and the plates were allowed to dry. Dried plates were stained with 2 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Alternatively, cytospin preparations were fixed in 90% (v/v) cold methanol (−20 °C, 5 min) and dried. Dried plates were stained with 125 μg/ml acridine orange in phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). Nuclei were assessed in an Olympus OMT2 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with the appropriate epifluorescence filters at a final magnification of 1500×.DNA Fragmentation (40Sellins K.S. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3199-3206PubMed Google Scholar)Briefly, 107 cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and centrifuged. The supernatant containing the fragmented DNA molecules was recovered and digested with RNase A followed by proteinase K. Nucleic acids were precipitated in 50% isopropanol and 0.5m NaCl. The precipitates were pelleted by repeated high speed centrifugation and used for analyses by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide. The DNA migration was assessed in an image analyzer (FAS-II, Toyobo, Osaka, Japan).Suspension of Adherent CellsForced SuspensionAfter separation of nonadherent cells, adherent cells were washed four times with RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FCS. The adherent cells were then suspended by the following three different methods. 1) The adherent cells were incubated for 10 min in phosphate buffered saline with no Ca2+ or Mg2+and then suspended by pipetting; 2) the adherent cells were first overlaid with 5 ml of 0.05% trypsin, and 4.5 ml of the supernatant was removed and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min to allow the cells to round up. The cells were suspended by repeating the addition of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and pipetting; 3) addition of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and pipetting were repeated several times until the cells were completely suspended. Culture of the suspended cells was started by seeding at 5 × 105 cells/ml in normal medium of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS.Spontaneous SuspensionAfter the treatment of HL-60 cells with 100 nm PDB for 2 days, nonadherent cells were separated by gentle pipetting. PDB was then removed by a procedure that consisted of 1) medium changes for 3 times with fresh medium containing 5% FCS, 2) incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in a CO2incubator, and 3) further medium changes for 3 times. The medium change was made as gently as possible such that the cell adherence was not disturbed. During further incubation in fresh medium, the adherent cells spontaneously detached from plastic surfaces.Sphingosine Kinase AssaySphingosine kinase activity was measured essentially as described previously (41Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were lysed by freeze-thawing in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm ZnCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 15 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyrodoxine. Cytosolic fractions were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 105,000 ×g for 90 min. Sphingosine kinase activity in supernatants (50 μl) was measured by incubating with 5 μm sphingosine-BSA complex (42Zhang H. Buckley N.E. Gibson K. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 76-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and [γ-32P]ATP (1 mm, 0.2 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Labeled lipids were extracted with a mixture of chloroform/methanol/concentrated HCl (100:200:1, by volume), and the extract was partitioned into two phases by adding 2 mKCl/methanol (1:1, v/v) (43Hasegawa-Sakai H. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The lower phase was further washed twice with the same mixture and dried in a vacuum centrifuge at room temperature. The dried lipid was completely dissolved in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) with occasional stirring over 30 min. Lipids were resolved on silica gel plates (Silica Gel 60; Merck) impregnated with 1% potassium oxalate/2 mm EDTA, using the solvent system of butanol/water/acetic acid (3:1:1) (39Zhang H. Desai N.N. Olivera A. Seki T. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 114: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The phospholipid standards were visualized with molybdenum blue spray (Sigma), and the radioactivity was measured by autoradiography in a Bioimaging analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). In phorbol ester-induced monocyte/macrophage-like differentiation in human leukemic HL-60 cells (1Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the leukocyte integrin receptor Mac-1 is expressed on the cell surface (2Miller L.J. Schwarting R. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2891-2900PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells are growth-arrested at G1 of the cell cycle (3Rovera G. Olashaw N. Meo P. Nature. 1980; 284: 69-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Oda T. Kitajima K. Hirano T. Shimizu N. Utiyama H. Int. J. Hematol. 1993; 58: 125-128PubMed Google Scholar). Mac-1 (CR3, αMβ2, CD11b/CD18) is a member of the β2 integrin subfamily and plays a critical role in numerous physiological functions of monocytes and macrophages that are mediated by cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions (5Anderson D.C. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 175-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 6Hynes R.O.

Phorbol esters activate Mac-1 receptors on monocyte such that they promote vigorous phagocytosis (9Wright S.D. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1149-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 10Wright S.D. Licht M.R. Craigmyle L.S. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell.

Immun. 1996; 64: 4242-4248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Undifferentiated HL-60 and U937 cells express LFA-1 (αLβ2, CD11a/CD18) (2Miller L.J. Schwarting R. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2891-2900PubMed Google Scholar), another member of the β2 integrin subfamily, although at low levels. CD18 subunit mRNA is thus expressed constitutively, but CD11b subunit mRNA is not expressed at detectable levels (12Rosmarin A.G. Weil S.C. Rosner G.L. Griffin J.D. Arnaout M.A. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 131-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol ester up-regulates the steady state levels of both CD11b mRNA (13Pahl H.L. Rosmarin A.G. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1992; 79: 865-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CD18 mRNA (14Rosmarin A.G. Levy R. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1992; 79: 2598-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bottinger E.P. Shelley C.S.

Firm adherence of differentiated cells to tissue culture plastic dishes is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to CD18 (16Skoglund G. Patarroyo M. Forsbeck K. Nilsson K. IngelmanSundberg M Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar) or CD11b (17Hickstein D.D. Smith A. Fisher W. Beatty P.G. Schwartz B.R. Harlan J.M. Root R.K. Locksley R.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 513-519PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription factor NF-κB is constitutively activated by phorbol esters (18Griffin G.E. Leung K. Folks T.M. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and is indispensable for the CD11b gene expression and cell adhesion, because both are suppressed by a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-κB expression (19Eck S.L. Perkins N.D. Carr D.P. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6530-6536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by antisense oligonucleotides to RelA subunit (20Sokoloski J.A. Sartorelli A.C. Rosen C.A. Narayanan R. Blood. 1993; 82: 625-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol esters also induce apoptosis of HL-60 and U937 cells (21Gunji H. Hass R. Kufe D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which is accompanied by a marked decrease in bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels (22Delia D. Aiello A. Soligo D. Fontanella E. Melani C. Pezzella F. Pierotti M.A. Della Porta G. Blood. 1992; 79: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 protein inhibits apoptosis but has no significant effect on differentiation (23Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Blood. 1994; 83: 2261-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Terui Y. Furukawa Y. Sakoe K. Ohta M. Saito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Apoptosis of HL-60 cells induced by treatment with phorbol esters has been correlated with an increase in the steady-state level of sphingosine and elevation of the ceramidase activity (25Ohta H. Sweeney E.A. Masamune A. Yatomi Y. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, exposure of HL-60 cells to sphingosine induced apoptosis (25Ohta H. Sweeney E.A. Masamune A. Yatomi Y. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jarvis W.D. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Martin H.A. Kramer L.B. Erukulla R.K. Bittman R. Grant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8275-8284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Co-exposure of HL-60 cells to phorbol ester and sphingosine blocked phorbol ester-induced differentiation (27Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7617-7623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Merrill Jr., A.H. Sereni A.M. Stevens V.L. Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Kinkade Jr., J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12610-12615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cell adherence to plastic substrate protected HL-60 cells from apoptosis induced with phorbol esters (29Solary E. Bertrand R. Pommier Y. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1994; 8: 792-797PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP) 1The abbreviations used are: SPP, sphingosine-1-phosphate; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FCS, fetal calf serum; PDB, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate; DMS,N,N-dimethylsphingosine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 1The abbreviations used are: SPP, sphingosine-1-phosphate; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FCS, fetal calf serum; PDB, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate; DMS,N,N-dimethylsphingosine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. has been shown to prevent apoptosis in HL-60 cells or U937 cells induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or Fas ligand (30Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S. Nature. 1996; 381: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The principal mediator of apoptosis in these cases is ceramide, not sphingosine, but SPP could be equally effective in the protection of adherent HL-60 cells from phorbol ester-induced apoptosis. The several lines of experimental evidence summarized above suggested to us the following possibilities. 1) Apoptosis by sphingosine occurs by default (31Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar) in phorbol ester-treated HL-60 cells; 2) adherence to plastic by Mac-1 elicits an anchorage-dependent survival signal, and adherent cells may undergo anoikis by forced suspension (32Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar, 33Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar); 3) apoptosis in nonadherent cells and anoikis, as well, may be suppressed by the addition of SPP; and 4) if the commitment signal to apoptosis is lost faster than the survival signal, phorbol ester-differentiated and adherent HL-60 cells may de-differentiate and proliferate again by removing phorbol ester without perturbing the adherent state. Here we demonstrate that our model is substantiated by a line of experimental evidence that was obtained by studying adherent and suspended cell fractions separately after isolation.

The HL-60 cells used in this work were restricted to early passages characterized by a doubling time of 47 h. Cells were passaged before cell density reached 2 × 106 cells/ml and seeded at 3 × 105 cells/ml. The cell viability determined by trypan blue exclusion was scored during the course of culture and found to be higher than 90%. For the differentiation induction we used phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB; Sigma) rather than phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), because PDB can be easily removed from cells by simple washings (37Cooper R.A. Braunwald A.D. Kuo A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2865-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), provided that FCS or BSA is contained in the washing medium (38Lee L.-S. Weinstein I.B. J. Environ. Pathol. Toxicol. 1978; 1: 327-339PubMed Google Scholar). An ethanol stock solution of PDB (0.2 mm) was diluted before use to 10 μm with the culture medium and added to a cell culture of 5 × 105 cells/ml at a final concentration of 100 nm(4Oda T. Kitajima K. Hirano T. Shimizu N. Utiyama H. Int. J. Hematol. 1993; 58: 125-128PubMed Google Scholar). In using sphingolipids as effectors, cells in logarithmic growth were first precultured for 24 h in a serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml) and transferrin (5 μg/ml) and treated with drugs in the same medium (30Cuvillier O.

T3 action is mediated by T3 receptors (TRs) that bind to T3 response elements (T3REs) in this gene's 5′-flanking DNA. In transiently transfected hepatocytes, fragments of 5′-flanking DNA of the malic enzyme gene or artificial T3REs that conferred T3 stimulation also conferred MCFA inhibition to linked reporter genes. Thus, MCFA inhibition may be mediated through cis-acting T3REs and trans-acting TRs, distinguishing MCFA action from that of other fatty acids which act through unique sequence elements. Using binding assays and overexpression of TR, we showed that MCFAs inhibited the transactivating but not the silencing function of TR and did not alter binding of T3 to TR or of TR to T3RE. The C-terminal ligand-binding domain of TR was sufficient to confer stimulation by T3, but not inhibition by MCFA. Inhibition of transactivation by MCFA was specific: ligand-stimulated transcription from T3 or estrogen response elements was inhibited, but that from glucocorticoid or cyclic AMP response elements was not. We propose that MCFAs or metabolites thereof influence the activity of a factor(s) that interacts with the T3 and estrogen receptors to inhibit ligand-stimulated transcription.

Malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate and CO2, simultaneously generating NADPH from NADP+. In the livers of well fed birds, much of the NADPH generated by this reaction is used for de novofatty acid synthesis. Malic enzyme activity, like that of other lipogenic enzymes, is regulated by nutritional state (1Goodridge A.G. Biochem.

When starved chickens are fed or fed chickens are starved, malic enzyme activity, malic enzyme mass, malic enzyme mRNA abundance, and transcription of the malic enzyme gene increase or decrease by similar relative amounts and with time courses consistent with transcription being the primary regulated process (3Goodridge A.G.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Characterization of these T3REs indicates that each contributes differentially to the overall response of the gene to T3 (9Thurmond D.C. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1613-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Hexanoate (C6:0) and octanoate (C8:0) inhibit the T3-induced increase in transcription of the malic enzyme gene in chick embryo hepatocytes within 30 min of their addition; inhibition is reversible upon removal of fatty acid. Inhibition by MCFAs is selective; they have no effect on total transcription in isolated nuclei or on transcription of the genes for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or β-actin. Inhibition is also specific; 4- and 10-carbon fatty acids and several modified fatty acids have little or no effect (7Roncero C. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14918-14927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the MCFA effect may be relevant biologically. What might that biological relevance be? Levels of MCFAs in chicken plasma that are high enough to inhibit transcription have not been reported. During starvation, a process that inhibits transcription of the malic enzyme gene, however, fatty acid oxidation is increased. Concomitantly, production of hydroxylated fatty acids similar in chain length to the inhibitory MCFAs also is increased (11Tserng K.-Y. Jin S.-J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2508-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Christensen E. Gronn M. Hague T.-A. Christophersen B.O. Biochim. Biophys.

In hepatocytes in culture, MCFAs may be converted to hydroxylated fatty acids or metabolites similar thereto, and these may be the intracellular mediators of the inhibition of transcription. How might MCFAs inhibit transcription of the malic enzyme gene? Hydroxylated long-chain fatty acids activate transcription of the fungal gene for cutinase (14Woloshuk C.P. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by stimulating phosphorylation of a trans-acting factor that binds to a specific cis-acting enhancer element (15Bajar A.

Science. 1988; 242: 922-925Crossref Google Scholar). Polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids (PUFAs) stimulate transcription of the acyl-CoA oxidase gene by interacting with the trans-acting factor, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) (17Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), or its adipocyte counterpart, fatty acid-activated receptor (FAAR) (18Amri E.-Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2367-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These factors bind to peroxisomal proliferator response elements in the acyl-CoA oxidase gene. PUFAs also appear to inhibit expression of the S14 gene via a response element, the PUFA response element; the mechanism for this is not known (19Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O. Thelen A. Proc.

Exp. 1988; 37: 996-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Both long-chain fatty acids and their acyl-CoA derivatives inhibit binding of T3 to rat liver TR in vitro (23Li Q. Yamamoto N. Inoue A. Morisawa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In intact hepatocytes, however, MCFAs fail to inhibit binding of T3 to TR (7Roncero C. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14918-14927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that they act by some mechanism other than displacement of T3. We report here that inhibition of T3-stimulated transcription of the chicken malic enzyme gene caused by MCFAs is mediated by the receptor that binds to T3REs. This mechanism is distinct from that of fatty acids that act through unique sequence elements. Rather than displacing T3 from TR or displacing TR from T3RE, MCFAs inhibit the transactivation function of TR. MCFAs also inhibit estrogen-stimulated transcription through an estrogen response element and the estrogen receptor (ER), but have no effect on ligand-stimulated transcription mediated by glucocorticoid or cAMP response elements.

Nutr. Biochem. 1993; 4: 431-439Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Isolated hepatocytes were separated from red blood cells; resuspended in Waymouth medium MD 705/1 supplemented with penicillin (60 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), insulin (50 nm), and corticosterone (1 μm); and incubated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes in an atmosphere of 5% CO2in air at 40 °C. Twenty hours after the cells were plated, they were transiently transfected using 40 μg of LipofectACE/well. Each 35-mm dish was transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA: p[ME−5800/+31]CAT (10.7 kilobase pairs, 2.5 μg) or a molar equivalent of other test constructs, pCMV-βGAL or pRSV-LUC (0.5 μg), and pBluescript KS+ (balance). Two 35-mm plates were used for each experimental condition. After 24 h in the transfection medium, the medium was removed by aspiration and replaced with Waymouth medium supplemented with or without 1.6 μm T3 and with or without 1 or 5 mm sodium hexanoate (26Baillie R.A. Klautky S.A. Goodridge A.G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1993; 4: 431-439Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both of these hexanoate concentrations caused similar degrees of inhibition (data not shown). Forty-eight hours after adding T3, the cells were harvested; lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing; and analyzed for soluble protein content (27Sedmark J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 1.1-16.20Google Scholar) activities. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 420 nm following incubation of cell lysates witho-nitrophenyl β-galactopyranoside. Luciferase activity was determined by measuring the light units emitted following incubation of cell lysates with luciferin. For CAT assays, samples of the cell lysates were heat-treated for 30 min at 60 °C; denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. CAT activity was determined by incubating a portion of cell lysate with acetyl-CoA and [14C]chloramphenicol for 15 h at 37 °C. Incubation mixtures were then extracted with ethyl acetate and subjected to thin-layer chromatography. Conversion to the acetylated product was detected by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry or direct autoradiography using the Packard InstantImager. Each oligonucleotide probe contained a 5′-extension and was labeled by a fill-in reaction catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of E. coliDNA polymerase I. Other procedures and the preparation of nuclear extracts were described previously (9Thurmond D.C. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1613-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from chick embryo hepatocytes incubated with insulin plus corticosterone plus T3, with or without hexanoate (1 mm). Other procedures were as described previously (10Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Statistical significances of differences between matched pairs were determined by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs, signed-rank test (31Conover W. Practical Nonparametric Statistics. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Interscience, New York1980Google Scholar). S.E. values are provided to indicate the degree of variability in the data. DNA constructs containing deletions from the 5′-end of the 5′-flanking DNA of the chicken malic enzyme gene were transiently transfected into chick embryo hepatocytes in culture in an effort to localize the inhibitory effect of MCFAs (hexanoate). Cells transfected with the longest construct (p[ME−5800/+31]CAT) responded to T3 with a 14-fold increase in CAT activity, and hexanoate inhibited T3-stimulated CAT activity by 83% (Fig. 1). We have previously reported that 5800 bp of 5′-flanking DNA of the malic enzyme gene contained the sequence element(s) required for stimulation of transcription by T3 (10Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The sequence element(s) necessary for inhibition by hexanoate were contained in the same DNA. Deletions to −5200, −4135, −3845, and −3474 bp resulted in 16-, 17-, 9-, and 7-fold stimulations by T3, respectively. The degree of inhibition by hexanoate was the same for cells transfected with each of these constructs. Cells transfected with constructs containing 5′-deletions to −2715 bp or to shorter end points did not respond to either T3 or hexanoate. These results confirmed the location of T3 response units (T3RUs) between −4135 and −3845 bp and between −3845 and −2715 bp (9Thurmond D.C. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1613-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The upstream T3RU contains four functional direct repeat T3REs at −3883 to −3858, −3833 to −3808, −3809 to −3784, and −3794 to −3769 bp; the 5′-most of these T3REs conferred 90% of the responsiveness of the entire upstream T3RU. The downstream T3RU contains a single T3RE at −3081 to −3056 bp (9Thurmond D.C. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1613-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Short internal deletions were made in two constructs (p[ME−5800/+31]CAT and p[ME−4135/+31]CAT) that were responsive to both T3 and hexanoate. Each deletion removed the major functional T3RE in the upstream T3RU; the minor T3REs in the upstream and downstream T3RUs were not deleted. T3 responsiveness decreased by ∼50% for both deletion constructs, but the MCFA responses were unaffected. Thus, any construct that conferred a T3 response also conferred inhibition by hexanoate, consistent with the possibility that T3REs themselves might confer inhibition by MCFA. Constructs that contain the upstream T3RU linked to TKCAT (p[ME−3903/−3617]TKCAT and p[ME−3903/−3703]TKCAT) conferred their responses to T3 via one major and three weak T3REs (9Thurmond D.C. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1613-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In cells transfected with these constructs, CAT activity was stimulated by T3 and inhibited by hexanoate (Fig. 2). Deletion of part of the strongest T3RE (p[ME−3868/−3617]TKCAT or p[ME−3868/−3703]TKCAT) caused a large reduction in T3responsiveness, but did not affect responsiveness to hexanoate. Deletions from the 3′-end of p[ME−3903/−3703]TKCAT to −3733 or −3769 bp did not affect T3 or hexanoate responses. Deletions to −3799, −3823, and −3863 bp gradually reduced responsiveness to T3 from >100-fold to 54-fold, consistent with the gradual loss of weak T3REs; inhibition by hexanoate was unaffected. In this set of experiments, the vector, pTKCAT, conferred a 2-fold stimulation by T3 and 39% inhibition by hexanoate; responses of cells transfected with pTKCAT were detectable in some batches of hepatocytes, but not others (cf. Figs. 3 and 4) and may have been transduced through a cryptic T3RE in pTKCAT (32Park H.-Y. Davidson D. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 319-330PubMed Google Scholar). In those experiments in which pTKCAT-transfected hepatocytes had small but statistically significant responses to T3 and hexanoate, cells transfected with constructs containing the malic enzyme DNA inserted into pTKCAT were not judged to be responsive to T3 or hexanoate unless the responses were significantly greater than those of cells transfected with the vector alone. In those experiments in which pTKCAT-transfected hepatocytes had no statistically significant response to T3, hexanoate had no inhibitory effect. The results of this set of experiments remain consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition by hexanoate is conferred by T3REs and that inhibition was not localized to a specific T3RE within this region.Figure 3Effects of T3 and hexanoate on CAT activity in hepatocytes transfected with DNA constructs containing block mutations in T3RE half-sites.

An etheno-modified DNA, poly(dεA) was adapted as the first DNA and an oligo(dT) as the second DNA, making it possible to distinguish between the linear dichroism signals of the two DNA strands. The results indicate that binding of the second DNA does not alter the nucleobase orientation of the first bound strand and that the bases of the second DNA are almost coplanar to the bases of the first strand although somewhat more tilted (60 degrees relative to the fiber axis compared with 70 degrees for the first DNA strand). Similar results were obtained for the RecA·DNA complex formed with unmodified poly(dA) and oligo(dT). An almost coplanar orientation of nucleobases of two DNA strands in a RecA-DNA filament would facilitate scanning for, and recognition of, complementary base sequences. The slight deviation from co-planarity could increase the free energy of the duplex to facilitate dissociation in case of mismatching base sequences.

The RecA protein plays a crucial role in homologous recombination in Escherichia coli: it regulates the synthesis of proteins involved in recombination reaction, including RecA itself, and catalyzes strand-exchange reaction (1Clark A.J. Margulies A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1989; 264: 288-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) forming a nucleoprotein filament (6Williams R.C. Spengler S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the complex, the protein monomers are arranged in a helical manner around the DNA, and the DNA is elongated about 50% in length. This RecA single-stranded DNA nucleofilament can then bind a second DNA (either single- or double-stranded DNA) and pair complementary parts. From fluorescence measurements of various probes attached to the DNA bases, we have concluded that direct base-base interaction of the Watson-Crick type contributes to the sequence recognition by RecA (7Wittung P. Nordén B. Kim S.-K. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5799-5803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Wittung P. Funk M. Jernström B. Nordén B. Takahashi M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Base-base interaction can occur between all three DNA strands in the RecA·DNA complex, supporting formation of a triplex DNA structure, as has been suggested by other studies (9Hsieh P. Camerini-Otero C.S. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1951-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Rao B.J. Dutreix M. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several models of different base-triads, involved in triplex-structure of recombination intermediates have been proposed (11Zhurkin V.B. Raghunathan G. Ulyanov N.B. Camerini-Otero R.D. Jernigan R.L.

Chartier M. Takahashi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1193-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Takahashi M. Nordén B. J. Mol. Recognition. 1994; 7: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). LD measures, on an aligned sample, the absorption difference of light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the sample orientation direction (16Nordén B. Kubista M. Kurucsev T. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 51-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The signal is related to both the local orientation of the chromophore in the macromolecule and to the degree of alignment of the whole molecule. LD can therefore be used to estimate the local orientation of the DNA bases in the RecA·DNA nucleofilament once the degree of alignment (the orientation factor) of the complex filaments under LD measurement condition is known. The orientation factor can be independently determined by SANS measurements on the same sample aligned under the identical conditions (13Nordén B. Elvingson C. Kubista M. Sjöberg B. Ryberg H. Ryberg M. Mortensen K. Takahashi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1175-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Chromophore-replacement analysis has been used to estimate the LD signal of a given chromophore in a complex which has more than two chromophores exhibiting overlapping signals. The analysis is based on the replacement of one of the components in the complex by an analog whose spectroscopic character differs from that of the original chromophore. Comparison of original and replaced spectra allows determination of the signal of a particular constituent (e.g. DNA) despite overlapping signals from other chromophores of the complex (e.g. ATP and RecA). Here we have determined selectively the orientation of the second DNA strand bound in a RecA·DNA filament using this approach. Poly(dεA), absorbing at higher wavelengths than normal DNA (around 320 nm), was used as the first DNA strand in the RecA·DNA filament to be able to distinguish its LD signal from that of the second DNA (oligo(dT)) in the complex. The nucleobases of the second DNA are found to be rather immobile and oriented less perpendicular to the axis of the protein filament but still rather similar to the bases of the first DNA strand. An almost coplanar base arrangement could favor base-base contacts between two DNA strands in the RecA filament and may facilitate the search for complementary sequences within the DNA molecules. RecA and poly(dεA) were prepared as described previously (17Takahashi M. Hagmar P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,18Chabbert M. Lami H. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5395-5400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(dA) and oligo(dT) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The size of polynucleotides was about 350 bases and that of the oligonucleotides about 20 bases. ATPγS was from Boehringer Mannheim and freshly dissolved solution was used without further purification. The concentrations were determined from UV absorption with ε280 nm = 21700 m−1cm−1 for RecA, ε264 nm = 8520m−1 cm−1 in base for oligo(dT), ε260 nm = 8600 m−1 cm−1 in base for poly(dA), and ε257 nm = 3800m−1 cm−1 in base for poly(dεA). RecA·DNA complexes were formed in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, with 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and 400 μm ATPγS, all in D2O. Initially, RecA was dialyzed against the D2O buffer mentioned above. A first RecA·DNA complex was formed by mixing 50 μm RecA and 150 μmpoly(dεA) in the above buffer and by incubation at room temperature. To form a complex with two DNA strands, oligo(dT) was added to the preformed RecA·poly(dεA) complex and further incubated. In another experiment, RecA·poly(dA) complex was first formed, and subsequently oligo(dT) was added in stoichiometric amounts in order to form a RecA complex with two DNA strands. Absorbance, LD, and SANS were measured on each sample. Absorbance was measured in a Cary 2000 spectrophotometer (Varian) with a bandwidth of 2 nm. Linear dichroism was measured in a modified Jasco J-500 spectropolarimeter (19Nordén B. Seth S. Appl. Spectrosc. 1985; 39: 647-655Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with a bandwidth of 2 nm. No smoothing procedure was applied to any of the spectra. SANS data were collected in the facility at Riso National Laboratory, Denmark. The sample to detector distance was 3.86 m, and neutron wavelength was 0.723 nm, as described in Nordén et al. (13Nordén B. Elvingson C. Kubista M. Sjöberg B. Ryberg H. Ryberg M. Mortensen K. Takahashi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1175-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). LD and anisotropic SANS measurements were performed on the sample aligned by an inner rotating Couette cell of the same dimension and with identical shear gradients, 620 s−1. Assessment of nucleobase orientation of DNA strands in RecA filaments was made as follows. LD is defined as the differential absorption, LD = A parallel –A perpendicular, between orthogonal forms of plane polarized light. The reduced dichroism, LDr = LD/A iso for DNA (with A iso the normal, isotropic absorbance) at a given wavelength, is related to the angle between the light-absorbing transition moments in the DNA and orientation axis of the RecA·DNA complex (i.e. the fiber axis) (16Nordén B. Kubista M. Kurucsev T. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 51-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), LDr=3/2S(3cos2α−1)Equation 1 where S, the orientation factor describing the degree of alignment of the fibrous complex, is determined from SANS anisotropy data (13Nordén B. Elvingson C. Kubista M. Sjöberg B. Ryberg H. Ryberg M. Mortensen K. Takahashi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1175-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the RecA·DNA complex with poly(dεA), LDr could be straightforwardly determined for the 320 nm absorption band (polarized in the plane of the etheno-adenine chromophore (20Holmèn A. Albinsson B. Nordén B. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 13460-13469Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar)) since, at this wavelength, neither protein nor cofactor displays any interfering absorption. Combining LDr data with SANS-determined orientation factorS allows us to estimate an effective value of α, the angle the nucleobase planes make with the protein-filament axis (see Fig. 3). The SANS and LD samples referred to identical flow cell geometry and flow rates. But in order to not exceed a maximum absorbance of 2, some LD sample was diluted 1:5. Control experiments, in the absorption region where the absorbance did not exceed about 2 absorbance units, showed that the orientation of the RecA·DNA fibers was not significantly dependent on the concentration (14Hagmar P. Nordén B. Baty D. Chartier M. Takahashi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1193-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether the orientation of the nucleobases of a first bound DNA strand in a RecA·DNA filament is altered upon binding of a second DNA strand. We measured LD of RecA·DNA complexes with poly(dεA) before and after addition of a second DNA, oligo(dT). Poly(dεA) exhibits an extra absorption band above 320 nm in which wavelength region the signals from normal DNA, ATPγS, and RecA are negligible (21Kubista M. Takahashi M. Nordén B. Nucleosides & Nucleotides. 1988; 7: 783-786Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The LD signal above 320 nm is, thus, only related to the orientation of etheno-adenine, with no interference from other components. As a second DNA, we used short oligonucleotides (oligo(dT) around 20 bases long) instead of polynucleotides, to avoid formation of network structures which may prevent orientation of the complexes in the shear flow (22Simonson T. Kubista M. Sjöback R. Ryberg H. Takahashi M. J. Molecular Recognition. 1994; 7: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The LD signal of the ATPγS·RecA·poly(dεA) complex above 320 nm was negative (Fig. 1), as observed previously (23Takahashi M. Kubista M. Nordén B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), in quantitative agreement with a rather perpendicular base orientation relative to the protein-filament axis. Upon addition of oligo(dT) to saturate the second DNA-binding site in RecA, the intensity of the negative signal around 260 nm increased, however, without modifying the LD signal in the region above 320 nm (Fig. 1). Binding of a second DNA to the RecA·DNA complex apparently does not affect the average orientation of the nucleobases of poly(dεA) bound in the first DNA-binding site of RecA. Thus, assuming an essentially unchanged base orientation of the first bound DNA strand, the base orientation of the second DNA strand in the complex could be assessed from the difference (LD spectrum of ATPγS·RecA·poly(dεA)·oligo(dT) complex) – (LD spectrum of ATPγS·RecA·poly(dεA) complex). This difference spectrum had a maximum centered around 260 nm and had a shape similar to that of the oligo(dT) absorption spectrum which is centered at 264 nm (Fig. 1). This observation of similarity between spectral shapes supports the idea that the increase in negative LD around 260 nm upon oligo(dT) binding to the RecA·poly(dεA) complex is indeed due to the base orientation of the second DNA. Since the LD is negative, the nucleobases of the second DNA too are oriented rather perpendicular to the filament axis. As mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” one can quantitatively determine the effective angle of the nucleobases relative to the orientation axis of the RecA·DNA filament from the LD signal, provided information about the degree of alignment of the overall fiber is available (see Fig. 3). From SANS anisotropy measured under identical flow conditions, the second-moment orientation function can be estimated from a comparison of the experimental SANS data with the anisotropy calculated for flow model orientation distributions (13Nordén B. Elvingson C. Kubista M. Sjöberg B. Ryberg H. Ryberg M. Mortensen K. Takahashi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1175-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The SANS pattern of RecA·poly(dεA) as well as of RecA·poly(dεA)·oligo(dT) complexes exhibited a certain anisotropy in the presence of flow (Fig. 2). As a control that non-homogeneous detector sensibility is not the cause of virtual anisotropy, the difference in SANS pattern (differential SANS) between flow-oriented and randomly oriented sample was recorded, showing a systematic difference (Fig. 2 B). The measurements, in fact, show that the degrees of flow alignment of the RecA·poly(dεA) and RecA·poly(dεA)·oligo(dT) complexes were similar, corresponding to an orientation factor S in Equation 1 equal to about 0.12 (± 0.02). Using this value, we could compute the orientation angles of the first and second DNA from the LD data (Fig. 3). At a given degree of alignment of molecules (S), a reduced LD (LD/normal UV absorption) corresponds to an orientation degree of the chromophore to the alignment axis (angle α in Equation 1). The nucleobase orientation of first DNA (poly(dεA)) was estimated from reduced LD at 320 nm and found to be approximately 70 degrees as observed previously (13Nordén B. Elvingson C. Kubista M. Sjöberg B. Ryberg H. Ryberg M. Mortensen K. Takahashi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1175-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because of uncertainty on the Svalue (0.12 ± 0.02), the orientation could be between 68 and 78 degrees (Fig. 3). Since we found that the base orientation of the first DNA strand (poly(dεA)) was not altered upon the binding of the second DNA, it is reasonable to assume that the spectral difference (LD of RecA·poly(dεA)·oligo(dT) complex – LD of RecA·poly(dεA) complex) reflects directly the signal from oligo(dT) at the sameS value. We thus estimated the reduced LD signal (at 260 nm) of oligo(dT) bound to the second site. The value of the reduced LD for oligo(dT) was significantly smaller than that for poly(dεA). This is not an effect of partial binding of oligo(dT) to the RecA·poly(dεA) filament because the titration controls showed that the second site was saturated at the addition of 3 bases/RecA of oligo(dT) (not shown), as expected for almost complete binding of oligo(dT). We therefore conclude that the bases of the second strand are on average more tilted than those of the first bound DNA strands. An angle of about 60 degrees was estimated relative to the long axis of the RecA filament (Fig. 3). Estimation is more precise at this α value (60 ± 2 degrees). We also examined the complex formed between RecA and two complementary, unmodified DNA strands, poly(dA) and oligo(dT). LD spectra of ATPγS· RecA·poly(dA) complex before and after addition of oligo(dT) as well as the differential LD spectrum for the oligo(dT) are shown in Fig. 4. For a quantitative analysis, the orientation factors of each complex were also determined by SANS measurements on the same samples under the same conditions as for the LD measurements. In this case, however, we could not experimentally distinguish the signal of oligo(dT) from that of poly(dA). We must, therefore, assume that the binding of second DNA does not alter the base orientation of first DNA, as was the case of the Rec A·poly(dεA)·oligo(dT) complex, to be able to estimate the base orientation of the second DNA. The results show that the average orientation of the first DNA bases was about 68 degrees and that of the second DNA bases was 60 degrees relative to the filament axis. The results were thus very similar to those for the RecA-poly(dεA)-oligo(dT) complex. To gain better insight into the pairing mechanism of complementary DNA strands by RecA and the base-base interactions occurring between the two DNA strands in the RecA filament, we have investigated the orientation of DNA bases in the complex. The base orientations were determined by combining LD and SANS data as described previously (13Nordén B. Elvingson C. Kubista M. Sjöberg B. Ryberg H. Ryberg M. Mortensen K. Takahashi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1175-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The results indicate for both of the types of DNAs investigated that the nucleobases of the second DNA are somewhat more tilted than those of the first DNA, but the difference is small so that the nucleobases of the two DNA strands are almost coplanar, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the base tilts of the two DNA strands are in opposite direction (Fig. 5). This is also the case when the two DNA molecules are not complementary in sequence. An almost coplanar structure is logical since it may facilitate effective base-base hydrogen bondings between the two DNA strands with the purpose of comparing sequences and of search for complementarity. The quantitative evaluation indicates that bases are neither perfectly perpendicular to the fiber axis nor coplanar to each other. This must be taken into account upon model building of the base-base interactions in the RecA·DNA complex filament. Most models of base triads of RecA-promoted triplexes are based on the assumption that all the nucleobases of the three DNA strands are perpendicular to the main DNA axis and are thus perfectly coplanar to each other, although the bases of conventional poly(dT):poly(dA):poly(dT) triplexes are generally not perfectly perpendicular to the helix axis (24Radhakrishnan T. Patel P.J. Structure. 1993; 1: 135-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Kim S.K. Takahashi M. Nordén B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our observation that the bases of the second bound DNA strand are more tilted than those of the first DNA could indicate a mechanism by which the RecA filament acts as a scaffold preventing the formation of classical Watson-Crick-Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, keeping the free energy of the complex higher than that of an ideal triplex. Such an arrangement would facilitate dissociation, in case of mismatch, and also facilitate longitudinal sliding of the DNA molecules relative to each other, which would be required for an efficient search-for-homology mechanism."
