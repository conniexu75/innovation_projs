https://openalex.org/W2123490990,"A major unanswered question in neuroscience is whether there exists genomic variability between individual neurons of the brain, contributing to functional diversity or to an unexplained burden of neurological disease. To address this question, we developed a method to amplify genomes of single neurons from human brains. Because recent reports suggest frequent LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition in human brains, we performed genome-wide L1 insertion profiling of 300 single neurons from cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus of three normal individuals, recovering >80% of germline insertions from single neurons. While we find somatic L1 insertions, we estimate <0.6 unique somatic insertions per neuron, and most neurons lack detectable somatic insertions, suggesting that L1 is not a major generator of neuronal diversity in cortex and caudate. We then genotyped single cortical cells to characterize the mosaicism of a somatic AKT3 mutation identified in a child with hemimegalencephaly. Single-neuron sequencing allows systematic assessment of genomic diversity in the human brain."

There is limited information regarding the specific biological activities and cellular and molecular mechanisms by which wine polyphenolic components might modulate AD. We assessed accumulations of polyphenols in the rat brain following oral dosage with a Cabernet Sauvignon red wine and tested brain-targeted polyphenols for potential beneficial AD disease-modifying activities. We identified accumulations of select polyphenolic metabolites in the brain. We demonstrated that, in comparison to vehicle-control treatment, one of the brain-targeted polyphenol metabolites, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, significantly reduced the generation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides by primary neuron cultures generated from the Tg2576 AD mouse model. Another brain-targeted metabolite, malvidin-3-O-glucoside, had no detectable effect on Aβ generation. Moreover, in an in vitro analysis using the photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) technique, we found that quercetin-3-O-glucuronide is also capable of interfering with the initial protein-protein interaction of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 that is necessary for the formation of neurotoxic oligomeric Aβ species. Lastly, we found that quercetin-3-O-glucuronide treatment, compared to vehicle-control treatment, significantly improved AD-type deficits in hippocampal formation basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation, possibly through mechanisms involving the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Brain-targeted quercetin-3-O-glucuronide may simultaneously modulate multiple independent AD disease-modifying mechanisms and, as such, may contribute to the benefits of dietary supplementation with red wines as an effective intervention for AD.—Ho, L., Ferruzzi, M.

https://openalex.org/W2161158602,"Evidence suggests that protein misfolding is crucially involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, controversy still exists regarding the involvement of proteasomes or autophagy in ALS due to previous conflicting results. Here, we show that impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but not the autophagy-lysosome system in motor neurons replicates ALS in mice. Conditional knock-out mice of the proteasome subunit Rpt3 in a motor neuron-specific manner (Rpt3-CKO) showed locomotor dysfunction accompanied by progressive motor neuron loss and gliosis. Moreover, diverse ALS-linked proteins, including TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43), fused in sarcoma (FUS), ubiquilin 2, and optineurin were mislocalized or accumulated in motor neurons, together with other typical ALS hallmarks such as basophilic inclusion bodies. On the other hand, motor neuron-specific knock-out of Atg7, a crucial component for the induction of autophagy (Atg7-CKO), only resulted in cytosolic accumulation of ubiquitin and p62, and no TDP-43 or FUS pathologies or motor dysfunction was observed. These results strongly suggest that proteasomes, but not autophagy, fundamentally govern the development of ALS in which TDP-43 and FUS proteinopathy may play a crucial role. Enhancement of proteasome activity may be a promising strategy for the treatment of ALS."

In addition to their impact on modern RNA metabolism, they are important model systems for understanding pre-mRNA splicing, because they share a common ancestor with the spliceosomal machinery that is required for splicing of pre-mRNAs in eukaryotes (Pyle and Lambowitz, 2006Pyle A.M.

Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor2006: 469-505Google Scholar). Excised group II introns are important catalysts for genomic diversification because they reverse-splice into DNA and incorporate themselves into new genomic locations through retrotransposition (Dai and Zimmerly, 2002Dai L. Zimmerly S. The dispersal of five group II introns among natural populations of Escherichia coli.RNA. 2002; 8: 1294-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given their profound and continuing impact on gene expression and evolution in all domains of life (Mattick, 1994Mattick J.S. Introns: evolution and function.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and their widespread applications in biotechnology (García-Rodríguez et al., 2011García-Rodríguez F.M. Barrientos-Durán A. Díaz-Prado V. Fernández-López M. Toro N. Use of RmInt1, a group IIB intron lacking the intron-encoded protein endonuclease domain, in gene targeting.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the chemical mechanism of group II intron catalysis. Fundamental insights into the mechanisms of RNA cleavage and ligation by group II introns have been obtained through biochemical experiments and from crystal structures of the Oceanobacillus iheyensis group IIC intron (Pyle and Lambowitz, 2006Pyle A.M. Lambowitz A.M. Group II introns: ribozymes that splice RNA and invade DNA.in: Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World.

Crystal structure of a self-spliced group II intron.Science. 2008; 320: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). These studies have revealed an intricate architectural scaffold that encloses a catalytic pocket within its core. The pocket is formed by three highly conserved motifs that are joined into a triple helix containing nucleotides from the conserved “catalytic triad” of intron domain 5 (D5, C358-G359-C360), the two-nucleotide bulge of D5 (A376-C377), and the J2/3 junction (A287-G288-C289). The resulting motif binds two divalent ions (M1 and M2) that participate directly in the mechanism of chemical catalysis (Gordon and Piccirilli, 2001Gordon P.M. Piccirilli J.A. Metal ion coordination by the AGC triad in domain 5 contributes to group II intron catalysis.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar; Toor et al., 2008aToor N.

Keating K.S. Pyle A.M. Structural basis for exon recognition by a group II intron.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1221-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the lack of information on other metals near the active site, and on the position of key reactants, had so far precluded a clear understanding of group II intron and, potentially, spliceosomal catalysis. To address these issues, we present an extensive set of intron crystal structures obtained at different stages of the splicing reaction in the presence of diverse metal ion cofactors. In this way, we define key structural elements necessary for hydrolytic group II intron splicing, including a heteronuclear metal ion center within the active site and the position of the reaction nucleophile. We report the structure of the excised intron in an alternative conformation and, on the basis of mutagenesis and in vitro splicing data, we show that it is involved in the second step of splicing. Our results lead us to propose a functional model for group II intron splicing in which the J2/3 motif toggles between two alternative conformations during the transition from the first to the second step of splicing. This model agrees with functional and structural data available for the nuclear spliceosome and has important implications for understanding the structural basis for all pre-mRNA splicing. To determine the structure of the intron at sequential stages of catalysis, we created two constructs that contain O. iheyensis group II intron domains 1–5 with and without a short 5′ exon (Oi5eD1-5 and OiD1-5, respectively). These optimized constructs, which are fully active ribozymes, lack flexible sections that had been included in previous studies (Toor et al., 2008aToor N. Keating K.S. Taylor S.D. Pyle A.M. Crystal structure of a self-spliced group II intron.Science. 2008; 320: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), thereby facilitating strict control over the binding of reaction substrates and oligonucleotide ligands. Using the Oi5eD1-5 construct, we solved the intron structure before and after 5′ exon hydrolysis at 3.1 Å and 2.9 Å resolution, respectively. The prehydrolytic state (the stage prior to the first step of splicing) was crystallized in the presence of Ca2+ (Figure 1 and Table S1 available online), which is a known inhibitor of Mg2+-dependent enzymes (including group II introns) and which has previously been employed to crystallize endonucleases in complex with their substrates (Erat and Sigel, 2008Erat M.C. Sigel R.K. Divalent metal ions tune the self-splicing reaction of the yeast mitochondrial group II intron Sc.ai5γ.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 1025-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; Viadiu and Aggarwal, 1998Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. The role of metals in catalysis by the restriction endonuclease BamHI.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar; and this work, Figure 2). The posthydrolytic state was crystallized in the same condition, but with catalytically active Mg2+ ions that stimulate hydrolysis of the 5′ exon (Figure S1). Overall, both structures are nearly identical to those determined previously (i.e., root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] values of 0.6 Å with respect to Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID code 3IGI), and their active sites adopt the characteristic triple helix conformation that is stabilized by a dehydrated metal ion of previously unknown identity, here classified as K1 (vide infra). In the precatalytic state, the metal ions M1 and M2 coordinate the pro-R oxygen atom of the scissile phosphate at the 5′ splice junction (Figure 1), as predicted from chemical biology experiments (Padgett et al., 1994Padgett R.A. Podar M. Boulanger S.C. Perlman P.S. The stereochemical course of group II intron self-splicing.Science. 1994; 266: 1685-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar; Podar et al., 1995Podar M. Perlman P.S. Padgett R.A. Stereochemical selectivity of group II intron splicing, reverse splicing, and hydrolysis reactions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4466-4478PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, M1 coordinates the 3′-OH leaving group (belonging to the last nucleotide of the exon), whereas M2, together with C358 (catalytic triad), coordinates a solvent molecule located 2.7 Å from the scissile phosphate. This solvent molecule, validated by the calculation of the corresponding simulated-annealing electron density omit-map (Figure S1), is in the precise position that would be occupied by the reaction nucleophile, which consists either of a 2′-OH group when splicing proceeds through the branching pathway, or an H2O in the hydrolytic splicing pathway that is typical for group IIC introns (Pyle, 2010Pyle A.M. The tertiary structure of group II introns: implications for biological function and evolution.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 45: 215-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Finally, the geometry of the 5′ splice junction is constrained by two other interactions. Upstream of the scissile phosphate, the 5′ exon is immobilized by base complementarity to exon binding site 1 (EBS1), whereas downstream of the scissile phosphate, the 5′ end of the intron is stabilized by a fourth important yet still uncharacterized metal ion, K2 (vide infra). As a consequence of these interactions, the 5′ splice junction adopts a sharp “kink” (Chan et al., 2012Chan R.T. Robart A.R. Rajashankar K.R. Pyle A.M. Toor N. Crystal structure of a group II intron in the pre-catalytic state.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with an unusually small backbone angle of approximately 50° at the scissile position (the backbone angle is defined here as the angle formed by three consecutive phosphorus atoms, Table S2). Upon hydrolysis, the kink relaxes and the scissile phosphate displaces by ∼4 Å, where it is neutralized by electrostatic interactions with K2. By contrast, the 5′ exon does not displace significantly, instead maintaining its coordination to M1 and thus occupying an ideal position to react as the nucleophile at the 3′ splice junction during the second step of splicing.Figure 2Splicing Reactions in the Presence of Different Ion AnaloguesShow full captionSplicing is robust in all ion combinations that support the structural integrity of the triple helical, active intron conformation (K+/Mg2+, Rb+/ Mg2+, Tl+/ Mg2+, and NH4+/ Mg2+). By contrast, splicing is impaired in Cs+/Mg2+, likely due to the larger size of Cs+ and to its consequently suboptimal occupation at the K1 site. Mg2+ analogs (i.e., Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+) completely inhibit splicing despite ensuring the overall correct assembly of the intron. Finally, Na+ and Li+ also do not promote catalysis because they favor the toggled intron conformation (see Figure 4). Upon splicing, the precursor RNA (5e-I-3e) forms intermediate product (I-3e), linear intron (I), ligated exons (5e-3e), and hydrolyzed 5′ and 3′ exons (5e and 3e, respectively).

In conclusion, the structures of the Oi5eD1-5 constructs reveal the position of the key structural elements necessary for catalyzing the first step of splicing as it proceeds through the hydrolytic pathway. In addition to structural characterization of 5′ splice site hydrolysis, we also succeeded in solving the intron structure in a completely empty, exon-free state at 3.5 Å resolution. By crystallizing the OiD1-5 construct in the absence of any added or residual oligonucleotides, which were present in all previous studies (Toor et al., 2010Toor N. Keating K.S. Fedorova O.

Keating K.S. Pyle A.M. Structural basis for exon recognition by a group II intron.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1221-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we show that the free intron possesses a remarkably intact active site. The intron core adopts the typical triple helix conformation and maintains the positions of the four metal ions M1, M2, K1, and K2 (Figure S3). This ligand-free structure represents the intron product at the end of the splicing cycle after release of ligated exons. In this state, the intron can attack and retrotranspose into host genomes. Upon rebinding ligated exons, it can also catalyze spliced-exon reopening (SER), a reaction that provides a well-established enzymological mimic for the retrotransposition event (Mikheeva et al., 2000Mikheeva S. Murray H.L. Zhou H. Turczyk B.M. Jarrell K.A. Deletion of a conserved dinucleotide inhibits the second step of group II intron splicing.RNA. 2000; 6: 1509-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar; Podar et al., 1995Podar M. Perlman P.S. Padgett R.A. Stereochemical selectivity of group II intron splicing, reverse splicing, and hydrolysis reactions.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4466-4478PubMed Google Scholar). The empty intron therefore provides a useful starting point for studying the infectious form of this ribozyme as it is poised to recognize substrates. To visualize the free intron as it moves through a cycle of target binding and cleavage, we cocrystallized OiD1-5 with oligonucleotide substrates that are identical in sequence to native, ligated exons. We obtained two structures at 3.0 Å and 2.7 Å resolution in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, respectively, which describe target recognition both before and after hydrolysis. In the precatalytic state, the scissile phosphate of the substrate presents its pro-S oxygen atom to the two catalytic metals M1 and M2 (Figure 3). As in the 5′ exon hydrolysis reaction, M1 coordinates the leaving group, whereas M2, together with C358, coordinates a solvent molecule that likely represents the reaction nucleophile (Figure S3). Upstream of the scissile position, the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide tightly binds to the EBS1 site, and it does not displace upon hydrolysis. Downstream of the scissile phosphate, the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide forms a well-defined Watson-Crick base pairing between the scissile uridine and the EBS3 adenosine (A223) in the precatalytic state, but this contact is released after hydrolysis. Constrained by the interactions with the exon binding sites, the junction of the ligated exons is relatively extended and forms a backbone angle of 137°. In conclusion, the structures of the OiD1-5 construct with and without a target substrate reveal that the free intron is structurally intact, with a perfectly well-formed core that can readily bind target RNA or DNA molecules without undergoing extensive structural rearrangement. A consistent feature of the structures described above are the four metal ions (M1, M2, K1, and K2) involved in the reaction mechanism. Given their central importance for all the splicing reactions characterized thus far, it was essential to unambiguously establish the identity, location, and functional role of these ion cofactors. To this end, we selectively replaced each putative type of ion with alkaline and alkali-earth metals, monitoring the effects of the substitutions crystallographically, by using X-ray anomalous scattering, and biochemically, through splicing assays. Previous crystallographic investigations that used the heavy ion Yb3+ established that M1 and M2 correspond to multivalent ion binding sites (Toor et al., 2008aToor N. Keating K.S. Taylor S.D. Pyle A.M. Crystal structure of a self-spliced group II intron.Science. 2008; 320: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and here we confirmed this by using Ca2+ (3.3 Å resolution) and Ba2+ (4.0 Å resolution, Figure S2). The M1 and M2 sites are also fully occupied in the structures obtained by using Mg2+ as the only multivalent cation, and they possess the octahedral coordination geometry typical of Mg2+ (Andreini et al., 2008Andreini C. Bertini I. Cavallaro G. Holliday G.L. Thornton J.M. Metal ions in biological catalysis: from enzyme databases to general principles.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 1205-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that M1 and M2 are occupied by Mg2+ under physiological conditions. Based on their location relative to the scissile linkage and on the biochemically-established role of their coordinating ligands (Boulanger et al., 1995Boulanger S.C. Belcher S.M. Schmidt U. Dib-Hajj S.D. Schmidt T. Perlman P.S. Studies of point mutants define three essential paired nucleotides in the domain 5 substructure of a group II intron.Mol. Cell.

Mutations of the two-nucleotide bulge of D5 of a group II intron block splicing in vitro and in vivo: phenotypes and suppressor mutations.RNA. 1996; 2: 1161-1172PubMed Google Scholar), it is also likely that M1 and M2 participate directly in the mechanism of chemical catalysis. Not surprisingly, substituting Mg2+ with divalent ion analogs Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ inhibits splicing almost completely (Figure 2). Such inhibitory effect can be ascribed to the fact that these ions do not allow the correct formation of the trigonal bipyramidal reaction intermediate that is typical of the SN2 nucleophilic reaction performed by the intron, as observed in other systems (McConnell et al., 1997McConnell T.S.

By contrast, although previous structures revealed electron density peaks at the positions that we define as K1 and K2 (Toor et al., 2010Toor N. Keating K.S. Fedorova O. Rajashankar K. Wang J.

To characterize the K1 and K2 sites, we solved the structure of OiD1-5 in the presence of heavy monovalent ions Tl+ (2.8 Å resolution), Rb+ (3.3 Å resolution) and Cs+ (3.4 Å resolution). All anomalous difference Fourier electron density maps show two pronounced peaks within the intron core at the K1 and K2 positions (and not at the M1 and M2 positions, Figure S2). All structures are intact overall, but Cs+, which is the largest ion (Table S3), induces a distortion in the active site. Additionally, we solved the structure of OiD1-5 in the presence of NH4+ (2.9 Å resolution), which possesses an ionic radius similar to K+, and in Na+ (3.2 Å resolution), which has a smaller radius (Table S3). It is significant that NH4+, but not Na+ (vide infra), can bind at the K1 and K2 positions. Therefore, we conclude that K1 and K2 are specific monovalent ion binding sites with strict size requirements for proper occupancy, and it is likely that they are occupied by K+ under physiological conditions. It is significant that the M1, M2, and K1 ions are each joined by a single shared ligand atom (the pro-R oxygen of the scissile phosphate in the 5′ splice junction and the pro-S oxygen of C377, respectively). Given this bonding pattern, these metals can be formally classified as a heteronuclear KMgO cluster (Cotton and Wilkinson, 1980Cotton A.F. Wilkinson G. Symmetry and Structure.in: Advanced organic chemistry. A comprehensive text. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, USA1980: 58-59Google Scholar), resembling the clusters observed in metalloproteins (Messerschmidt et al., 2001Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Poulos T. Wieghardt K. Handbook of metalloproteins. Wiley, Chirchester, UK2001Google Scholar). However, a metal cluster composed of magnesium and potassium ions has not been reported to date, and it may represent a unique attribute of RNA enzymes. This trinuclear M1-M2-K1 cluster, together with the ion K2, forms a four-metal center that constitutes an essential cofactor for group II intron catalysis. Complementary functional analysis confirms this hypothesis. Specifically, we examined the effects of different monovalent and divalent cations on the splicing activity of wild-type O.i. group II intron. We observed that all ion combinations that produced well-diffracting crystals with well-formed active sites (K+/Mg2+, NH4+/ Mg2+, Rb+/ Mg2+, and Tl+/ Mg2+) also displayed robust splicing (Figure 2). By contrast, splicing is inhibited in the presence of Cs+ and blocked in Na+, two ions that preserve the overall structure of the ribozyme yet distort the local active-site architecture. Thus, enzyme activity perfectly mirrors the results from crystallography. Taken together, the collection of structures and accompanying biochemistry demonstrate that M1, M2, K1, and K2 form a functional metal center in which each type of ion plays a role in catalysis. It is likely that additional ions also contribute indirectly to activity through their role in supporting the intron structure. Indeed, our collection of high-resolution X-ray anomalous scattering maps obtained for Tl+, Rb+, Cs+, and Ba2+ now reveal the identity of site-bound divalent and monovalent metals throughout the entire OiD1-5 structure (three of which are described in Figure S2), thus providing much-needed information on the role of metals in the architectural fabric of RNA. As reported above, when K+ is replaced by Na+ in the crystallization buffer, the K1 and K2 sites are not occupied and this structural feature induces a loss of electron density at the M1 and M2 sites. Such disruption of the active site is accompanied by the dislocation of the J2/3 junction and D5 bulge residues G288 and C377, which become stabilized by a completely different network of interactions (Figure 4)"

https://openalex.org/W1995299916,"A crystalline material is investigated that responds to a slowly increasing external stress by exhibiting impulsive ‘avalanche’ behaviour as well as smooth stress release that is approximately as slow as the external stress rate; unusual oscillatory behaviour in the avalanche time series is reported. Many systems respond impulsively to slowly increasing external stresses. Normally smooth processes of stress release can be disrupted intermittently by large random events (or avalanches), such that a system undergoes abrupt structural changes. Using a combination of theory and experiment in a model system consisting of nickel microcrystals under compression, Stefanos Papanikolaou and colleagues investigate an intermediate regime in which the smooth background processes occur at similar rates to the external driving stresses, leading to the unusual observation of oscillatory behaviour in the fast avalanches themselves. This finding is, in principle, applicable to all intermittent phenomena with coexisting slow relaxations that compete to minimize the local internal stress. This description would include complex networks — such as the brain — during relaxation, disordered/jammed solids and earthquake faults, forcing a re-interpretation of experimental and simulation data. When external stresses in a system—physical, social or virtual—are relieved through impulsive events, it is natural to focus on the attributes of these avalanches1,2. However, during the quiescent periods between them3, stresses may be relieved through competing processes, such as slowly flowing water between earthquakes4 or thermally activated dislocation flow5 between plastic bursts in crystals6,7,8. Such smooth responses can in turn have marked effects on the avalanche properties9. Here we report an experimental investigation of slowly compressed nickel microcrystals, covering three orders of magnitude in nominal strain rate, in which we observe unconventional quasi-periodic avalanche bursts and higher critical exponents as the strain rate is decreased. Our experiments are faithfully reproduced by analytic and computational dislocation avalanche modelling10,11 that we have extended to incorporate dislocation relaxation, revealing the emergence of the self-organized avalanche oscillator: a novel critical state exhibiting oscillatory approaches towards a depinning critical point12. This theory suggests that whenever avalanches compete with slow relaxation—in settings ranging from crystal microplasticity to earthquakes—dynamical quasi-periodic scale invariance ought to emerge."
https://openalex.org/W1967003483,"The polypeptide exit tunnel is an important functional compartment of the ribosome where the newly synthesized proteins are surveyed. The tunnel is the target of clinically important macrolide antibiotics. Macrolides plug the tunnel and are believed to stop production of all proteins. Contrary to this view, we show that drug-bound ribosomes can synthesize a distinct subset of cellular polypeptides. The structure of a protein defines its ability to thread through the antibiotic-obstructed tunnel. Synthesis of certain polypeptides that initially bypass translational arrest can be stopped at later stages of elongation while translation of some proteins goes to completion. Our findings reveal that small-molecule effectors can accentuate the discriminatory properties of the ribosomal exit tunnel and that macrolide antibiotics reshape the cellular proteome rather than block global protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2057340956,"Mitochondrial homeostasis via mitochondrial dynamics and quality control is crucial to normal cellular functions. Mitophagy (mitochondria removed by autophagy) stimulated by a mitochondrial uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), requires Parkin, but it is not clear why Parkin is crucial to this process. We found that in the absence of Parkin, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone induced the formation of mitochondrial spheroids. Mitochondrial spheroid formation is also induced in vivo in the liver by acetaminophen overdose, a condition causing severe oxidative mitochondrial damages and liver injury. Mitochondrial spheroids could undergo a maturation process by interactions with acidic compartments. The formation of this new structure required reactive oxygen species and mitofusins. Parkin suppressed these mitochondrial dynamics by promoting mitofusin degradation. Consistently, genetic deletion of mitofusins without concomitant expression of Parkin was sufficient to prevent mitochondrial spheroid formation and resumed mitophagy. Mitochondrial spheroid formation and mitophagy could represent different strategies of mitochondrial homeostatic response to oxidative stress and are reciprocally regulated by mitofusins and Parkin."

Lamin B receptor (LBR) is a classical inner nuclear membrane protein that associates with heterochromatin, and its mutations are known to cause Pelger-Huët anomaly in humans.

Here, we show that LBR represses transcription by binding to chromatin regions that are marked by specific histone modifications.

Several aromatic amino acid residues in those tudor domains, which make a structure called a “histone code-reading pocket,” are known to be needed for recognition of specific histone modifications (17.Botuyan M.V.

These amino acid residues are also conserved in the tudor domain of LBR (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, LBR may also recognize some specific histone modifications. However, recent studies show that the tudor domain of LBR does not appear to bind methylated lysine or arginine residues (15.Liokatis S. Edlich C. Soupsana K. Giannios I. Panagiotidou P.

Details of the complete matrix of peptides are provided in supplemental Table 1. Celluspot was first treated with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque) for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding, and then incubated with 100 nm GST-NPWT, GST-NPW16A, or GST-TudWT protein at 4 °C for 1.5 h in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) with 1 mg/ml BSA. After washing five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), Celluspot was incubated with anti-GST antibody as the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS-T five times, and then incubated with anti-mouse HRP-conjugated IgG as the secondary antibody. Spots were stained with Chemi-Lumi One L (Nacalai Tesque), and the positive spots were detected by chemiluminescence LAS1000 (Fujifilm).

After centrifugation to remove insoluble materials, the supernatants were incubated with 10 μg of anti-LBR and normal rabbit IgG, and Dynabeads (protein A; Invitrogen; 100-μl original suspension) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of Tx-lysis buffer and then suspended in SDS-sample buffer. After incubation at 95 °C for 1 h to reverse cross-linking, the supernatants were subjected to Western blotting. HeLa cells (5 × 104) were added to a 35-mm dish on day 0. Stealth siRNAs for luciferase, lamin B1, and lamin B2 (20 nm) were transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions on day 1. The plasmid encoding LBR-GFP (2 μg) and the siRNAs (20 nm) were co-transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent on day 2. Determination of knockdown efficiency by Western blotting and immunostaining, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed on day 3.

Twenty images were collected using 488-nm argon ion laser excitation (1% transmission; 494 ms/frame; 1.6 μs/pixel; 512 × 512 pixels; pinhole 160 μm; 6× zoom) before bleaching, then a 2-μm diameter spot was bleached (100% 488-nm laser transmission; eight iterations), and a further 200 images were collected using the original settings. Photobleaching during imaging was monitored in all experiments and was normalized before drawing the recovery curve. The decrease in fluorescence intensity during imaging was <15%. Diffusion coefficients of LBRs were calculated as a single diffusion model according to Axelrod et al. (27.Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E. Webb W.W. Mobility measurement by analysis of fluorescence photobleaching recovery kinetics.Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar). Sprague et al. have indicated that slowly diffused molecules including the binding/dissociation reactions in the cells can be described as an effective diffusion (28.Sprague B.L. Pego R.L. Stavreva D.A. McNally J.G. Analysis of binding reactions by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3473-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In the case of LBR, the diffusion coefficient of the LBR-chromatin complex could be approximated to zero during the observation time. Therefore, the LBR dynamics could be considered a single population diffusion coefficient, and we were able to use the Axelrod model. FLAG-tagged LBRWT or FLAG-tagged LBRW16A was transiently expressed in HeLa cells. The cells (6.0 × 104) were treated at 4 °C for 2 h with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque)) containing 1 unit/ml DNase (Roche Applied Science) and 100 μg/ml RNase (Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was mixed with 10 μl of anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated Sepharose beads (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the beads were treated with SDS-sample buffer to elute the proteins. The fraction containing the eluted protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-LBR, anti-lamin B1, and anti-lamin B2 antibodies. The DNA plasmid, pBlueScript II KS(−), was digested with ScaI and XhoI restriction enzymes. The digested 1.8-kbp linear dsDNA was purified by gel extraction and used for chromatin reconstitution experiments as described previously (23.Hizume K. Yoshimura S.H. Takeyasu K. Linker histone H1 per se can induce three-dimensional folding of chromatin fiber.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12978-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA was mixed with core histone proteins in high salt buffer and dialyzed against low salt buffer. The reconstituted chromatin was incubated with LBR fragments for 30 min at 4 °C, fixed for 30 min at room temperature with fixation buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% glutaraldehyde) and then observed using a Nanoscope IIIa (Veeco, Plainview, NY) as described previously (23.Hizume K. Yoshimura S.H. Takeyasu K. Linker histone H1 per se can induce three-dimensional folding of chromatin fiber.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12978-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The calculation of the molar ratio of LBR to histone is discussed in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Nucleosome sizes were measured as described by Ohniwa et al. (29.Ohniwa R.L. Morikawa K. Takeshita S.L. Kim J. Ohta T. Wada C. Takeyasu K. Transcription-coupled nucleoid architecture in bacteria.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The radius of curvature of the cantilever was determined using a DNA width of 2 nm in the images. Reporter assays were performed as described previously with slight modifications (30.Tsuchiya M. Ogawa H. Suzuki T. Sugiyama N. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Exportin 4 interacts with Sox9 through the HMG box and inhibits the DNA binding of Sox9.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e25694Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, we used 200 ng of the MH100×4-tk-Luc plasmid as a reporter gene. This plasmid contains four copies of an MH100 gene and a basal promoter, thymidine kinase (tk), upstream of luciferase. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. The expressed GAL4-LBR protein fragments were detected with anti-GAL4 DNA-BD antibody. We expressed the whole nucleoplasmic region of LBR, corresponding to amino acid residues 1–211 (designated the NP domain; see Fig. 1 for LBR domain nomenclature), to investigate whether the LBR NP domain recognizes a specific histone modification (16.Huang Y.

First, we used a Celluspots peptide array comprising 384 histone tail peptides with various combinations of modifications; this array is a powerful tool for determining the specificity of histone modification-recognition domains (31.Bock I. Kudithipudi S. Tamas R. Kungulovski G. Dhayalan A. Jeltsch A. Application of Celluspots peptide arrays for the analysis of the binding specificity of epigenetic reading domains to modified histone tails.BMC Biochem. 2011; 12: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The array was incubated with the GST-fused wild-type NP domain (NPWT) and then probed with anti-GST antibody. NPWT specifically bound to peptides containing the single modifications H4K20me2 and H4K20ac and exhibited partial binding to H4K20me1 (Fig. 2A; see supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1 for the complete data). Interestingly, these binding specificities were altered by additional modifications around H4K20 (Fig. 2A, H4R19me2s, H4R19me2a, H4R23me2s, and H4R23me2a; and see Fig. 8A). To confirm the histone modification-binding specificity of LBR, we next performed a pulldown assay by using recombinant histone H4 proteins with different modifications (i.e. unmodified, K20me1-modified, and K20me2-modified), and K20me2-containing H4 was selectively pulled down with NPWT (Fig. 2B, WT). To elucidate the role of the tudor domain, we generated a point mutant in which tryptophan 16 was substituted with alanine (NPW16A), because aromatic residues such as tryptophan and tyrosine in the histone code-reading pocket of tudor domains are essential for recognizing specific histone modifications (17.Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Structural basis for the methylation state-specific recognition of histone H4-K20 by 53BP1 and Crb2 in DNA repair.Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). NPW16A did not bind to any of the recombinant H4 proteins tested (Fig. 2B, W16A). Also, in experiments using the array, NPW16A lost specificity (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating tryptophan 16 is a key residue for determining binding specificity.FIGURE 8Model of transcriptional repression beneath the NE by LBR.

The ChIP assay revealed that H4K20me2 was enriched with LBR (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, it was difficult to detect the enrichment of H4K20ac because it was significantly less abundant in the cells (data not shown). In addition, we investigated the H4K20me2 distrib"

This maturational process is called capacitation and in mouse sperm it involves a plasma membrane reorganization, extensive changes in the state of protein phosphorylation, increases in intracellular pH (pHi) and Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and the appearance of hyperactivated motility. In addition, mouse sperm capacitation is associated with the hyperpolarization of the cell membrane potential. However, the functional role of this process is not known. In this work, to dissect the role of this membrane potential change, hyperpolarization was induced in noncapacitated sperm using either the ENaC inhibitor amiloride, the CFTR agonist genistein or the K+ ionophore valinomycin. In this experimental setting, other capacitation-associated processes such as activation of a cAMP-dependent pathway and the consequent increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation were not observed. However, hyperpolarization was sufficient to prepare sperm for the acrosome reaction induced either by depolarization with high K+ or by addition of solubilized zona pellucida (sZP). Moreover, K+ and sZP were also able to increase [Ca2+]i in non-capacitated sperm treated with these hyperpolarizing agents but not in untreated cells. On the other hand, in conditions that support capacitation-associated processes blocking hyperpolarization by adding valinomycin and increasing K+ concentrations inhibited the agonist-induced acrosome reaction as well as the increase in [Ca2+]i. Altogether, these results suggest that sperm hyperpolarization by itself is key to enabling mice sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction. Mammalian sperm are unable to fertilize the egg immediately after ejaculation; they acquire this capacity during migration in the female reproductive tract.

Altogether, these results suggest that sperm hyperpolarization by itself is key to enabling mice sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction. In the female tract, mammalian sperm undergo capacitation, a functional maturational process that prepares them for fertilization. Although the acquisition of fertilizing capacity is still considered the end point of capacitation, various indications suggest that the physiological changes occurring to the sperm during capacitation are not a single event, but a series of sequential and concomitant processes (1.Visconti P.E. Understanding the molecular basis of sperm capacitation through kinase design.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Capacitation is correlated with functional changes in sperm parameters such as the activation of sperm motility known as hyperactivation (2.Chang H. Suarez S.S. Rethinking the relationship between hyperactivation and chemotaxis in mammalian sperm.Biol. Reprod. 2010; 83: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the preparation to undergo a physiologically induced acrosome reaction (3.Visconti P.E. Krapf D. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Acevedo J.J. Darszon A. Ion channels, phosphorylation and mammalian sperm capacitation.Asian J. Androl. 2011; 13: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Taking into consideration the highly differentiated and compartmentalized nature of sperm, it can be postulated that the molecular basis of capacitation should account for independent changes occurring in different sperm compartments such as the flagellum (e.g. hyperactivation) and the head (e.g. preparation for the acrosome reaction) (3.Visconti P.E. Krapf D. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Acevedo J.J. Darszon A. Ion channels, phosphorylation and mammalian sperm capacitation.Asian J. Androl. 2011; 13: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Biochemically, capacitation is associated with: 1) changes in the sperm plasma membrane (e.g. decrease in cholesterol, asymmetry of phospholipids) (4.Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D.

However, it has been shown in multiple species that activation of PKA is needed for hyperactivation and to prepare the sperm for the acrosome reaction (3.Visconti P.E.

On the other hand, the role of the capacitation-associated Em hyperpolarization has been hypothesized to be related with the ability of sperm to generate a transient Ca2+ elevation during the acrosome reaction induced by physiological agonists (e.g. solubilized zona pellucida (sZP)) (10.Arnoult C.

However, this possibility has been recently challenged by two main observations: 1) CaV3.1 and 3.2 mice knock out genetic models are fertile (16.Escoffier J. Boisseau S. Serres C. Chen C.C. Kim D. Stamboulian S. Shin H.S. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. Arnoult C.

Physiol. 2007; 212: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); and 2) patch clamp measurements in epididymal sperm failed to detect CaVs (17.Ren D. Xia J. Calcium signaling through CatSper channels in mammalian fertilization.Physiology. 2010; 25: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18.Lishko P.V. Botchkina I.L. Kirichok Y. Progesterone activates the principal Ca2+ channel of human sperm.Nature. 2011; 471: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that these channels are not essential for fertilization. Nevertheless, these reports are silent in relation to the role of the capacitation-associated Em hyperpolarization. Regarding this process, mice genetic models lacking the sperm-specific K+ channel SLO3 are basically sterile (19.Santi C.M. Martínez-López P. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Butler A. Alisio A. Darszon A. Salkoff L. The SLO3 sperm-specific potassium channel plays a vital role in male fertility.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20.Zeng X.H. Yang C. Kim S.T.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 5879-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Sperm from these mice do not undergo Em hyperpolarization during capacitation. In addition, these sperm are not able to acrosome react even when exposed to the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Interestingly, if these sperm are hyperpolarized with the K+ ionophore valinomycin, they become responsive to A23187 (19.Santi C.M. Martínez-López P. de la Vega-Beltrán J.L. Butler A. Alisio A. Darszon A. Salkoff L. The SLO3 sperm-specific potassium channel plays a vital role in male fertility.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1041-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that hyperpolarization is necessary for the acrosome reaction. In the present work, we evaluated the hypothesis that hyperpolarization is necessary and sufficient for sperm to undergo [Ca2+]i increases and the acrosome reaction in response to sZP. To test this hypothesis, Em hyperpolarization was induced with either valinomycin, amiloride (7.Hernández-González E.O. Sosnik J. Edwards J. Acevedo J.J. Mendoza-Lujambio I. López-González I. Demarco I. Wertheimer E. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. Sodium and epithelial sodium channels participate in the regulation of the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization in mouse sperm.J. Biol.

Ocampo A.Y. Wertheimer E. Visconti P.E. Darszon A. Involvement of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in mouse sperm capacitation.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24397-24406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in sperm-incubated under conditions that do not support capacitation (absence of HCO3− and BSA). Under these conditions, the cAMP/PKA pathway and the consequent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation did not occur. However, sperm underwent hyperpolarization and acquired the ability to acrosome react in response to a K+-induced depolarization. Moreover, once hyperpolarized, addition of sZP induced an increase in [Ca2+]i and the acrosome reaction, changes that were not observed when the hyperpolarizing agents were omitted. On the other hand, to test whether hyperpolarization was needed for the preparation to undergo the ZP-induced acrosome reaction, sperm were incubated under conditions that support capacitation but in the presence of valinomycin and increasing concentrations of K+ to block the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization. Under these conditions, sperm underwent activation of PKA and tyrosine phosphorylation. However, neither the ZP-induced acrosome reaction nor the increase in [Ca2+]i were observed. Our findings are consistent with the proposal that sperm hyperpolarization by itself is key to enabling mice sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction. Amiloride, genistein, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and valinomycin were purchased from Sigma. Fluo-4AM, BCECFAM, 3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5)), and natural mouse laminin were purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-phosphotyrosine (pY) monoclonal antibody (clone 4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and rabbit monoclonal anti-phosphoPKA substrates (clone 100G7E) was purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Stock solutions (1 mm final) of DiSC3(5), CCCP, amiloride, genistein, and valinomycin were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at −20 °C except when otherwise stated. Experimental protocols were approved by the University of Massachusetts and by the Instituto de Biotecnología/UNAM Animal Care Committees. In all the experiments, cauda epididymal mouse sperm were collected from CD1 retired male breeders by placing minced cauda epididymis in a modified Krebs-Ringer medium (Whitten's-HEPES-buffered (WH) medium) (22.Moore G.D. Ayabe T. Visconti P.E. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S.

This medium, which does not support capacitation, was prepared without bovine serum albumin (BSA) and NaHCO3. After 5 min, sperm in suspension were washed in 10 ml of the same medium by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at room temperature (24 °C). Sperm were then resuspended to a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml and diluted ten times in the appropriate medium depending on the experiment performed. In experiments where capacitation was investigated, 5 mg/ml of BSA and 24 mm of NaHCO3 were added. The pH was maintained at 7.4. Em was measured as previously described (23.Demarco I.A. Espinosa F.

Briefly, sperm were collected as indicated above and diluted in media supporting or not capacitation in the absence or in the presence of amiloride (1 μm), genistein (10 μm), or valinomycin (1 μm), as indicated in the “Results.” Eight min before measurement, 1 μm DiSC3(5) (final concentration) was added to the sperm suspension and further incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. CCCP (0.5 μm final) was then added to collapse mitochondrial potential and sperm incubated for two additional minutes. After this period, 0.8 ml of the suspension was transferred to a gently stirred cuvette at 37 °C and the fluorescence monitored with a Hansatech MkII fluorometer (Norfolk, UK) at a 620/670-nm excitation/emission wavelength pair.

After treatments, sperm were collected by centrifugation, washed in 1 ml of PBS, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, 5% β-mercaptoethanol was added to the supernatants and boiled again for 5 min. Protein extracts equivalent to 1–2 × 106 sperm per lane were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) at 250 mA for 60 min at 0 °C. Membranes were blocked with 2% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (T-TBS). Antibodies dilution in T-TBS were as follows: 1/10,000 for anti-PY (clone 4G10) and 1/5,000 for anti-pPKAs (clone 100G7E). Secondary antibodies were used at 1/10,000 in T-TBS. Films were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. If needed, PVDF membranes were stripped at 60 °C for 15 min in 2% SDS, 0.74% μ-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.5, and washed 6 × 5 min in T-TBS. In every case, molecular masses were expressed in kDa. Zona pellucidae were prepared from homogenized ovaries of virgin female 60-day-old outbred CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) as described (24.Ward C.R. Storey B.T. Kopf G.S.

The percentage of acrosome reaction was measured using Coomassie Blue G-250 staining as described (26.Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Ning X. Moore G.D. Valenzuela J.P. Jorgez C.J. Alvarez J.G.

Briefly, sperm were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min under the conditions mentioned for each experiment followed by the addition of 5 zona pellucida equivalents/μl. After an additional 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, fixative solution (5% final concentration of formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each tube. Following fixation, 10-μl aliquots of suspension were spread onto glass slides and air-dried. The slides were then stained with 0.22% Coomassie Blue G-250 in 50% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid for 3–5 min, gently rinsed with deionized H2O, air-dried, and mounted with 50% (v/v) glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. To calculate the percentage of acrosome reaction, at least 100 sperm were assayed per experimental condition for the presence or absence of the characteristic dark blue acrosomal crescent. The percentage of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa was calculated for each experimental condition dividing the number of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa by the total number of spermatozoa scored (sum of acrosome-reacted and non acrosome-reacted) and multiplying this ratio by 100. Epididymal motile mice sperm were collected by swim-up in WH medium at 37 °C for 15 min. The motile cells were incubated with 2 μm Fluo-4 AM and 0.05% pluronic acid in WH medium supplemented or not with BSA and NaHCO3 according to experimental capacitating conditions. Once loaded, sperm were immobilized on mouse laminin (100 mg/ml) coated cover slips to allow recordings. Sperm were incubated with WH medium alone for control experiments or with amiloride (1 μm), genistein (10 μm), or valinomycin (1 μm) during 15–30 min. Ca2+ imaging in a system which consisted of a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope with a Plan Apo 60X/1.40 oil Nikon objective was performed before, during, and after K+ or sZP stimulation; as a vitality control 10 μm ionomicyn was added at the end of each experiment. Fluo-4 loaded sperm were excited with a stroboscopic LED-based fluorescence illumination system as previously described (60.Nisihigaki T. Wood C.D. Shiba K. Baba S.A. Darszon A. Light-emitting diode (LED) stroboscopic illumination has significant advantages for fluorescence live cell imaging: a demonstration by fluorescence imaging of motile sperm.BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 61) with 4 ms light excitation pulses. Fluorescence was captured with a Cool Snap (Photometrics USA) at 0.5 Hz or 1 Hz. Image sequences (movies) were obtained from a given field of view and saved in tif format. Movies were processed and analyzed with macros written in Image J (Version 1.38, National Institutes of Health). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on each sperm and then transferred to the movie for quantification. A plot was generated in Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Fluorescence is expressed as (F-F0)/F0. To examine the role of sperm Em independently of other capacitation-associated events, three compounds known to hyperpolarize sperm in the absence of capacitating conditions (i.e. capacitating media minus BSA and HCO3−) were tested. Our group has shown previously that both amiloride (7.Hernández-González E.O. Sosnik J. Edwards J. Acevedo J.J. Mendoza-Lujambio I. López-González I. Demarco I. Wertheimer E. Darszon A. Visconti P.E.

It is also well established that valinomycin hyperpolarizes sperm to the K+ equilibrium potential (EK) (23.Demarco I.A. Espinosa F. Edwards J. Sosnik J. De La Vega-Beltran J.L. Hockensmith J.W.

Mouse sperm membrane potential: changes induced by Ca2+.FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed in Fig. 1A. However, the consequences of these additions in other capacitation-associated parameters such as the increase in phosphorylation of PKA substrates and the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation have not been evaluated. To test whether hyperpolarization is sufficient to induce these phosphorylation events, sperm were incubated in the absence of HCO3− and BSA for 1.5 h and in the presence of increasing concentrations of amiloride (Fig. 1B), genistein (Fig. 1C), or valinomycin (Fig. 1D). Western blots using anti-phosphorylated-PKA substrates (anti pPKAs) and anti-phosphotyrosine (anti PY) antibodies indicate that these compounds are not able to induce capacitation-associated changes in phosphorylation. Altogether, these results point out that these conditions can be used to investigate the role of Em hyperpolarization independently of other capacitation-associated events. To examine the role of the hyperpolarization we asked if this membrane potential change was able to prepare sperm to respond to a K+-induced depolarization. Addition of high K+ concentrations (50–100 mm) to capacitated mouse sperm has been shown to induce the acrosome reaction (11.Darszon A. Nishigaki T. Beltran C. Treviño C.L.

Biol. 1992; 152: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Ca2+ changes were investigated using single cell analysis in sperm incubated in conditions that support or not capacitation or hyperpolarized with amiloride, genistein, or valinomycin. Addition of 50 mm K+ to capacitated sperm increased [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2, A and B) and the percentage of acrosome reaction (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, the same K+ addition did not induce the acrosome reaction in noncapacitated sperm (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, K+ was able to increase the percentage of acrosome reacted sperm in noncapacitated sperm if these sperm were previously incubated in the presence of either amiloride, genistein or valinomycin (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that only hyperpolarized sperm are capable of responding to a K+ depolarization. The K+-induced [Ca2+]i increase was not observed in Fluo-4 loaded sperm that had not been hyperpolarized (Fig. 3A). In contrast, pharmacologically hyperpolarized sperm underwent an increase in [Ca2+]i when depolarized by a K+ addition (Fig. 3, B–D and supplemental movies S1–S5). Similar to the case of capacitated sperm, as described before, the sperm population is het"

Here we report that hepatitis C virus (HCV) transiently activates the PI3K-AKT pathway. This activation was observed as early as 15 min postinfection, peaked by 30 min, and became undetectable at 24 h postinfection. The activation of AKT could also be mediated by UV-inactivated HCV, HCV pseudoparticle, and the ectodomain of the HCV E2 envelope protein. Because antibodies directed against CD81 and claudin-1, but not antibodies directed against scavenger receptor class B type I or occludin, could also activate AKT, the interaction between HCV E2 and its two co-receptors CD81 and claudin-1 probably triggered the activation of AKT. This activation of AKT by HCV was important for HCV infectivity, because the silencing of AKT by siRNA or the treatment of cells with its inhibitors or with the inhibitor of its upstream regulator PI3K significantly inhibited HCV infection, whereas the expression of constitutively active AKT enhanced HCV infection. The PI3K-AKT pathway is probably involved in HCV entry, because the inhibition of this pathway could inhibit the entry of HCV pseudoparticle but not the VSV pseudoparticle into cells. Furthermore, the treatment of cells with the AKT inhibitor AKT-V prior to HCV infection inhibited HCV infection, whereas the treatment after HCV infection had no obvious effect. Taken together, our studies indicated that HCV transiently activates the PI3K-AKT pathway to facilitate its entry.

The tetraspanin protein CD81 is another co-receptor for HCV, which interacts with the HCV glycoprotein E2 at a postattachment step. A recent study determined that the maximal half-time for CD81-mediated HCV entry was 17 min, suggesting a role of CD81 in HCV entry in the immediate early step after binding (23.Bertaux C. Dragic T. Different domains of CD81 mediate distinct stages of hepatitis C virus pseudoparticle entry.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 4940-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The tight junction protein claudin-1 is mainly expressed in the liver, and its first extracellular loop is responsible for the interaction with CD81. Based on the observation that the maximal half-time for the anti-claudin-1 antibody to inhibit HCV entry was 73 min, it was suggested that claudin-1, which could form a complex with CD81 (24.Harris H.J. Davis C. Mullins J.G. Hu K. Goodall M. Farquhar M.J. Mee C.J. McCaffrey K. Young S. Drummer H. Balfe P. McKeating J.A. Claudin association with CD81 defines hepatitis C virus entry.J. Biol.

Occludin is another tight junction protein that is required for HCV entry at a postattachment step. Both CD81 and occludin restrict the host range of HCV, because they cannot be replaced by their murine homologues to mediate viral entry (25.Flint M. von Hahn T. Zhang J. Farquhar M. Jones C.T.

Upon its activation, it converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (27.Toker A. Cantley L.C. Signalling through the lipid products of phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase.Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar), which binds to and recruits AKT to the membrane for its phosphorylation by PDK1 at threonine 308 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) at serine 473 (28.Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. TOR signaling in growth and metabolism.Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4671) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation by PDK1 and mTORC2 activates AKT, which then regulates the activities of its many downstream effectors to affect cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis (29.Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N.

There are three different isoforms of AKT, which share a high degree of sequence homology. Whereas AKT1 and AKT2 are ubiquitous, AKT3 is only detected in the brain. AKT1 is anti-apoptotic and involved in cell survival, and AKT2 is a key effector of the insulin signaling pathway and regulates cellular metabolism (30.Juntilla M.M. Patil V.D. Calamito M. Joshi R.P.

Many viruses regulate the PI3K-AKT pathway for their replication (31.Cooray S. Apoptosis, Cell Signaling, and Human Diseases: Molecular Mechanisms. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2007: 57-80Google Scholar). Picornaviruses and paramyxoviruses have been shown to activate the PI3K-AKT pathway to promote viral replication. The influenza A virus also activates the PI3K-AKT pathway to enhance viral replication at a postentry step, and its NS1 protein can bind to and activate PI3K to suppress apoptosis (32.Shin Y.K. Liu Q. Tikoo S.K. Babiuk L.A. Zhou Y. Effect of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway on influenza A virus propagation.J. Gen.

It has been shown that the HCV NS5A protein binds to PI3K and activates the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (41.Street A. Macdonald A. McCormick C. Harris M.

In addition, the HCV core protein as well as HCV infection can induce the phosphorylation of serine 473 of AKT with no apparent effect on the phosphorylation of threonine 308 and hence impair the insulin signaling pathway (43.Banerjee S.

However, little is known regarding how the effect of HCV on the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway might affect HCV replication. In this report, we describe our studies on the relationship between HCV and the PI3K-AKT pathway. Surprisingly, we found that HCV rapidly and transiently activated AKT in the early stage of infection to enhance its entry. We further found that this activation was mediated by the interaction between the HCV E2 envelope protein and its co-receptors, CD81 and claudin-1. Huh7.5 and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen). The HCV genotype 2a JFH1 adaptive mutant, which produces a high level of infectious virus particles, has been recently described (45.Jiang J. Luo G. Cell culture-adaptive mutations promote viral protein-protein interactions and morphogenesis of infectious hepatitis C virus.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 8987-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). AKT, pAKT-473, and pAKT-308 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. The rabbit anti-core antibody was produced in rabbits using the HCV core protein expressed in Escherichia coli (46.Lo S.Y. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. Ou J.H. Differential subcellular localization of hepatitis C virus core gene products.Virology. 1995; 213: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Soluble E2 (sE2), the neutralizing CBH-5 human mAb against HCV E2, and the isotype-matched control human mAb R04 have been described previously (47.Keck Z.Y. Xia J. Cai Z. Li T.K. Owsianka A.M. Patel A.H. Luo G. Foung S.K. Immunogenic and functional organization of hepatitis C virus (HCV) glycoprotein E2 on infectious HCV virions.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-actin antibody, the mouse anti-SR-BI antibody, and a control mouse IgG were purchased from Abcam. The mouse anti-CD81 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences; the mouse anti-claudin-1 antibody was from Invitrogen; and the mouse anti-occludin antibody was obtained from Calbiochem. The monoclonal anti-HA antibody was prepared at the Caltech Hybridoma Core. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Abcam. The Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was obtained from Thermo Scientific. The mounting medium FluoroShield with DAPI was purchased from Sigma. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin was purchased from Sigma. AKT inhibitor II and V were obtained from EMD Millipore and Calbiochem, respectively. To determine the effect of sE2 on AKT, Huh7.5 cells were incubated with different amounts of sE2 for 2 h and then lysed for the immunoblot analysis of AKT. For the anti-E2 antibody neutralization assay, the HCV virus stock or sE2 was incubated with the CBH-5 anti-E2 antibody or the isotype control R04 on ice for 1 h prior to the incubation with Huh7.5 cells. Cells were lysed 2 h postincubation for the immunoblot analysis of AKT. For the analysis of the effects of anti-co-receptor antibodies on AKT, Huh7.5 cells were incubated with the control mouse IgG or the antibody directed against CD81, SR-BI, claudin-1, or occludin (5 μg/ml) for 2 h. Cell lysates were then collected for the AKT immunoblot analysis. The AKT kinase assay was conducted using the assay kit from Cell Signaling. Briefly, 200 μg of Huh7.5 cell lysates with or without HCV infection for 2 h were incubated with Sepharose beads conjugated with the anti-pAKT-473 antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing, beads were resuspended and incubated with 1 μl of 10 mm ATP and 1 μg of the recombinant GSK-3 substrate at 30 °C for 30 min. The AKT kinase activity was analyzed by immunoblot analysis of the level of phosphorylated GSK-3. HCV was irradiated with the UV light for 5 min and then used to infect Huh7.5 cells. Cells were lysed at 2 and 24 h postinfection for immunoblot analysis. Pseudoparticles of HCV (HCVpp) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVpp) that carried the firefly luciferase reporter gene were generated in 293T cells (14.Benedicto I. Molina-Jiménez F. Bartosch B. Cosset F.L. Lavillette D. Prieto J. Moreno-Otero R. Valenzuela-Fernández A. Aldabe R. López-Cabrera M. Majano P.L. The tight junction-associated protein occludin is required for a postbinding step in hepatitis C virus entry and infection.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 8012-8020Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Huh7.5 cells seeded in 6-well plates and pretreated with DMSO, AKT-V, or wortmannin for 3 h were inoculated with the same amount of HCVpp, VSVpp, or EnV− pseudoparticles. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the pseudoparticles, cells were lysed 72 h postinfection for the luciferase assay using the luciferase assay kit (Promega). The pseudoviral infectivity was determined after the subtraction of the mean EnV− signal from the mean HCVpp or VSVpp signal. Pooled siRNAs against AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 (Sigma) were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into Huh7.5 cells following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4 × 104 cells seeded in a 35-mm dish were transfected with 10 μl of AKT siRNAs (20 μm each) for 5 h and then transfected 24 h later with AKT siRNAs one more time for another 5 h. After the second transfection, cells were inoculated with HCV (MOI = 1) for 24 h and then lysed for immunoblotting or fixed for immunofluorescence staining. 4 × 104 Huh7.5 cells were seeded in a 35-mm dish and then transfected the next day with 2 μg of myr-AKT1, myr-AKT2 (generous gifts from Dr. Deborah Johnson), or the control pCDNA3.1 expression vector using Lipofectamine 2000. Five hours later, the transfection medium was replaced with the fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours later, cells were inoculated with HCV (MOI = 1) for 24 h and lysed for immunoblotting or fixed for immunofluorescence staining. Cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed with the radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF). After the sonication, cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation to remove cell debris. An aliquot of the supernatant containing 50 μg of proteins was used for gel electrophoresis. After the semi-wet transfer, the membrane was blocked with 5% milk for 30 min and incubated with the primary antibody for 4 h. After three washes with PBS containing 1% Tween 20 (PBST), the membrane was incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h. After further washes with PBST, chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce) were applied on the membrane, and the image was captured using the LAS-4000 imaging system (FujiFilm). Huh7.5 cells were seeded on a coverslip in a 6-well plate (5 × 105 cells/well). The next day, cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated in the blocking solution (PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 30 min and incubated with the control mouse IgG or the antibody directed against CD81, SR-BI, claudin-1, or occludin (1:200 dilution) for 2 h. Cells were washed with PBS three times and then incubated with the goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) for 2 h. After washing with PBS, the coverslip was mounted onto a glass slide with the mounting medium FluroShield for confocal microscopy. 2 × 104 Huh7.5 cells were seeded per chamber in the 8-well chamber slide and inoculated with serially diluted HCV the next day. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After the PBS wash, cells were incubated with the blocking solution (PBS, 5% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 min followed by incubation with the rabbit anti-core antibody for 2 h. Cells were washed with PBT (PBS, 0.3% Triton X-100) three times and incubated with the goat anti-rabbit Alexa-488 for 2 h. After three washes with PBT, cells on the slide were mounted with FluroShield with DAPI. The HCV core-positive cells were counted under the microscope for titration. Huh7.5 cells were treated with DMSO or the inhibitors to PI3K and AKT for 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized and mixed 1:9 with 0.4% trypan blue for the trypan blue exclusion assay. The cell viability was quantified using a hemocytometer. To determine whether HCV could affect the PI3K-AKT pathway, we infected Huh7.5 cells with a cell culture-adapted HCV JFH1 variant, which produced a significantly higher level of infectious virions than its parental JFH1 virus (45.Jiang J. Luo G. Cell culture-adaptive mutations promote viral protein-protein interactions and morphogenesis of infectious hepatitis C virus.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 8987-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and analyzed AKT at different time points after infection over a 2-day period. As shown in Fig. 1A, HCV did not affect the overall protein level of AKT in infected cells. However, it induced the phosphorylation of AKT at threonine 308 and serine 473 between 2 and 8 h postinfection. By 24 h postinfection, when the HCV core protein became detectable in infected cells, the induction of AKT phosphorylation was no longer visible, and instead, a suppression of AKT phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 was observed. This suppression of ATK phosphorylation by HCV was even more pronounced at 48 h postinfection. Because the induction of AKT phosphorylation peaked within 2 h of infection, we decided to further analyze the AKT status at earlier time points after HCV infection. As shown in Fig. 1B, the induction of AKT phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 was visible as early as 15 min postinfection, peaked at 30 min, and wa"

To reach this aim, gene expression in the spleens of naive chickens and those intravenously infected with S. Enteritidis with or without previous oral vaccination was determined by 454 pyrosequencing of splenic mRNA/cDNA. Forty genes with increased expression at the level of transcription were identified. The most inducible genes encoded avidin (AVD), extracellular fatty acid binding protein (EXFABP), immune responsive gene 1 (IRG1), chemokine ah221 (AH221), trappin-6-like protein (TRAP6) and serum amyloid A (SAA). Using cDNA from sorted splenic B-lymphocytes, macrophages, CD4, CD8 and γδ T-lymphocytes, we found that the above mentioned genes were preferentially expressed in macrophages. AVD, EXFABP, IRG1, AH221, TRAP6 and SAA were induced also in the cecum of chickens orally infected with S. Enteritidis on day 1 of life or day 42 of life. Unusual results were obtained for the immunoglobulin encoding transcripts. Prior to the infection, transcripts coding for the constant parts of IgM, IgY, IgA and Ig light chain were detected in B-lymphocytes. However, after the infection, immunoglobulin encoding transcripts were expressed also by T-lymphocytes and macrophages. Expression of AVD, EXFABP, IRG1, AH221, TRAP6, SAA and all immunoglobulin genes can be therefore used for the characterization of the course of S. Enteritidis infection in chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2052372969,"In filamentous fungi, peroxisomes are crucial for the primary metabolism and play a pivotal role in the formation of some secondary metabolites. Further, peroxisomes are important site for fatty acids β-oxidation, the formation of reactive oxygen species and for their scavenging through a complex of antioxidant activities. Oxidative stress is involved in different metabolic events in all organisms and it occurs during oxidative processes within the cell, including peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids. In Aspergillus flavus, an unbalance towards an hyper-oxidant status into the cell is a prerequisite for the onset of aflatoxin biosynthesis. In our preliminary results, the use of bezafibrate, inducer of both peroxisomal β-oxidation and peroxisome proliferation in mammals, significantly enhanced the expression of pex11 and foxA and stimulated aflatoxin synthesis in A. flavus. This suggests the existence of a correlation among peroxisome proliferation, fatty acids β-oxidation and aflatoxin biosynthesis. To investigate this correlation, A. flavus was transformed with a vector containing P33, a gene from Cymbidium ringspot virus able to induce peroxisome proliferation, under the control of the promoter of the Cu,Zn-sod gene of A. flavus. This transcriptional control closely relates the onset of the antioxidant response to ROS increase, with the proliferation of peroxisomes in A. flavus. The AfP33 transformant strain show an up-regulation of lipid metabolism and an higher content of both intracellular ROS and some oxylipins. The combined presence of a higher amount of substrates (fatty acids-derived), an hyper-oxidant cell environment and of hormone-like signals (oxylipins) enhances the synthesis of aflatoxins in the AfP33 strain. The results obtained demonstrated a close link between peroxisome metabolism and aflatoxin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1997744354,"Neurofibromatosis (NF1) represents the most common single gene cause of learning disabilities. NF1 patients have impairments in frontal lobe based cognitive functions such as attention, working memory, and inhibition. Due to its well-characterized genetic etiology, investigations of NF1 may shed light on neural mechanisms underlying such difficulties in the general population or other patient groups. Prior neuroimaging findings indicate global brain volume increases, consistent with neural over-proliferation. However, little is known about alterations in white matter microstructure in NF1. We performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analyses using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in 14 young adult NF1 patients and 12 healthy controls. We also examined brain volumetric measures in the same subjects. Consistent with prior studies, we found significantly increased overall gray and white matter volume in NF1 patients. Relative to healthy controls, NF1 patients showed widespread reductions in white matter integrity across the entire brain as reflected by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and significantly increased absolute diffusion (ADC). When radial and axial diffusion were examined we found pronounced differences in radial diffusion in NF1 patients, indicative of either decreased myelination or increased space between axons. Secondary analyses revealed that FA and radial diffusion effects were of greatest magnitude in the frontal lobe. Such alterations of white matter tracts connecting frontal regions could contribute to the observed cognitive deficits. Furthermore, although the cellular basis of these white matter microstructural alterations remains to be determined, our findings of disproportionately increased radial diffusion against a background of increased white matter volume suggest the novel hypothesis that one potential alteration contributing to increased cortical white matter in NF1 may be looser packing of axons, with or without myelination changes. Further, this indicates that axial and radial diffusivity can uniquely contribute as markers of NF1-associated brain pathology in conjunction with the typically investigated measures."
https://openalex.org/W2056512813,"Phosphorylation of NF-κB plays an important role in modulating transcriptional activity of NF-κB independently of inhibitor of κB (IκB) proteins. For the p65 subunit, multiple phosphorylation sites have been mapped in and adjacent to both the N-terminal Rel homology domain and the C-terminal transactivation domain. Their impact on NF-κB-dependent transcription, however, has never been assessed at a broader level. In this study, we evaluate the importance of differential p65 phosphorylation on four serine acceptor sites in the Rel homology domain for the expression of an array of NF-κB-dependent genes in endothelial cells. We find that inhibition of p65 phosphorylation on these serine residues targets NF-κB activity to distinctive gene subsets in a κB enhancer element-specific context. We show that the phosphorylation-dependent alterations in gene and protein expression are reflective of the amount of p65 and phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (p-RNAP II) bound to respective gene promoter regions. Depending on the gene subset, impaired gene expression was either a result of decreased p65 promoter recruitment or of a failure of bound p65 to recruit p-RNAP II. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that site-specific p65 phosphorylation targets NF-κB activity to particular gene subsets on a global level by influencing p65 and p-RNAP II promoter recruitment.

Gene expression regulation by NF-κB is fundamental for controlling many important cellular processes, including inflammatory and immune responses, cell proliferation, development, and apoptosis (1Barkett M.

This event constitutes the major step for initiation of NF-κB-dependent transcription as it allows the transcription factor to enter the nucleus where it can bind to regulatory sequences in gene promoters/enhancers. However, it has been shown that this step alone is often not sufficient to initiate gene expression. Inducible post-translational modification of NF-κB subunits especially by phosphorylation has proven to be equally important for NF-κB to efficiently induce transcription of target genes (8Huang B. Yang X.D. Lamb A. Chen L.F. Post-translational modifications of NF-κB: another layer of regulation for NF-κB signaling pathway.Cell.

Baeuerle P.A. The p65 subunit is responsible for the strong transcription activating potential of NF-κB.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), 12 phospho-acceptor sites have been mapped. Five sites (Ser-205, Thr-254, Ser-276, Ser-281, and Ser-311) are located in or adjacent to the N-terminal RHD, 2The abbreviations used are: RHDRel homology domainp-RNAP IIphosphorylated RNA polymerase II. and seven residues (Thr-435, Ser-468, Thr-505, Ser-529, Ser-535, Ser-536, and Ser-547) are contained in the C-terminal transactivation domain. Dependent on the stimulus and the modification site, phosphorylation of p65 regulates NF-κB transcriptional activity by different mechanisms. Ser-276 and Ser-311 phosphorylation in the RHD is enhancing p65 interaction with the transcriptional co-activator cAMP-response element-binding binding protein, thus activating NF-κB-dependent gene expression (10Duran A.

Whereas degradation of IκB and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB serves as a general step in NF-κB activation that affects expression of all dependent genes, there is strong evidence that the phosphorylation of p65 regulates the activity of NF-κB in a gene-specific context. Several studies have shown that reconstitution of p65-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts with p65 S205A, S276A, S281A, T435A, S468A, and S536A mutants leads to reduction of NF-κB transcriptional activity confined to certain genes (12O'Shea J.M.

Silencing of NF-κB-dependent transcription by nuclear IκB is dependent on p65 Ser-536 phosphorylation and targets TNF and IL-6 genes but not the interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene (28Ghosh C.C. Ramaswami S.

Because existing reports only include a limited amount of NF-κB responsive genes, it is still unclear, however, to what extent differential phosphorylation of NF-κB leads to changes in its transcriptional profile at a global level. In this study, we investigated the effects of impaired p65 serine phosphorylation in and adjacent to the RHD on the expression of an array of NF-κB-dependent genes. The mouse endothelial cell line bEND.3 was obtained from ATCC. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (3T3) isolated from p65−/− mice were a kind gift of Dr. A. Beg (Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL) and were described previously (29Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Embryonic lethality and liver degeneration in mice lacking the RelA component of NF-κB.Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin B (both Cellgro) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF; Invitrogen) was used at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. Stable shRNA cell pools and p65 transfectants were selected in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) and 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (InvivoGen), respectively. Sequence and cloning of murine p65 and luciferase shRNAs in pSiren-RetroX (Clontech) were described elsewhere (30Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. NF-κB regulates phagocytic NADPH oxidase by inducing the expression of gp91phox.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5657-5667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The bicistronic retroviral vector pLXIH was obtained by exchanging the neomycin resistance cassette of pLXIN (Clontech) with the hygromycin resistance gene. Insertion of human p65 WT, S205A, S276A, S281A, and S311A into pLXIH was carried out by standard cloning procedures. Endogenous p65 expression was suppressed in bEND.3 by retrovirally delivered shRNA. The resulting bEND.3 p65 knockdown cells as well as 3T3 p65−/− cells were retrovirally reconstituted with p65 WT or p65 phosphorylation-deficient mutants. Retroviral production, cellular infection with retrovirus-containing supernatants, and selection for positive cell pools was performed as described (22Anrather J. Racchumi G.

Chem. 2005; 280: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1× protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences)), and equal volumes were mixed with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore), blocked with 5% milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and incubated with polyclonal anti-p65 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (AC-74; Sigma). Membranes were washed in TBST and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and protein bands were visualized with Chemiluminescence Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on a Kodak Image Station 2000R. For immunofluorescence, cells were stimulated with TNF for 0, 30, and 60 min and processed as described previously (19Hochrainer K. Racchumi G. Anrather J. Hypo-phosphorylation leads to nuclear retention of NF-κB p65 due to impaired IκBα gene synthesis.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5493-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear p65 localization was determined as described elsewhere (31Hochrainer K. Racchumi G. Zhang S. Iadecola C. Anrather J. Monoubiquitination of nuclear RelA negatively regulates NF-κB activity independent of proteasomal degradation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 2057-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Transcriptional profiles of NF-κB-dependent genes were determined by quantitative real time PCR under untreated conditions and after 3 h of TNF stimulation. Genes were compiled after ranking induction levels in seven datasets derived from short term cytokine-induced endothelial cells deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The following datasets were used: GSE973, GSE973, GSE2639, GSE2638, GSE5883, GSE8166, and GSE9647. The first 200 ranked genes were tested for inclusion in two curated gene lists for NF-κB-regulated genes (Dr. T. Gilmore laboratory, Boston University and Bonsai Bioinformatics Software Server, Lille University of Science and Technology, France). Only genes listed in at least one of the databases were considered to be NF-κB-dependent. Hence, mRNA expression levels of 70 potentially NF-κB-regulated genes and two housekeeping genes used for normalization were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR Green chemistry (Fermentas) on a Chromo4 continuous fluorescence monitoring thermocycler (MJ Research) as described previously (22Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. cis-Acting, element-specific transcriptional activity of differentially phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A complete list of tested genes as well as primer sequences can be found in the supplemental Table 1. Three independent experiments were performed. In the final analysis, only genes were included that were called in all TNF-induced datasets and showed at least 2-fold induction of mRNA levels in p65 WT-reconstituted cells over the untreated or TNF-stimulated empty vector control. A total of 37 genes fulfilled all criteria (see Fig. 2). In 3T3 cells, eight genes were tested for induction of mRNA expression (see supplemental Fig. 1). Cells were collected in 1× citric saline (135 mm potassium chloride, 15 mm sodium citrate), spun down, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 anti-mouse CD54 (ICAM-1), PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-mouse CD106 (VCAM-1), and FITC anti-mouse H-2Kd antibodies (all Biolegend) for 20 min on ice. Antibodies were titrated using mouse splenocytes or bone marrow cells to achieve optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Fluorochrome-matched isotype controls were used to validate detection specificity. Analysis was performed on a six-channel (Accuri C6, BD Biosciences) cytometer. Cells were gated according to their forward and side scatters to eliminate debris and dead cells. Gates were validated by TOPRO-3 and fluorescein-diacetate labeling to identify dead and live cells, respectively. Analysis of median fluorescent intensity was performed on 20,000 live cells. ChIP analysis was carried out as described (30Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. NF-κB regulates phagocytic NADPH oxidase by inducing the expression of gp91phox.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5657-5667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) with the following variations. bEND.3 cells required 16 cycles of 15-s sonication pulses at 20% amplitude to yield 0.3–1.5-kb DNA fragments. For immunoprecipitation, 2 μg of anti-p65 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 0.8 μg of anti-p-RNAP II (CTD4H8; Upstate) antibodies were used. Monoclonal anti-p-RNAP II antibody was coupled to 2 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) before capturing with protein A-Sepharose. A list of primer sequences and targeting κB sites can be found in supplemental Table 2. The important conclusion that inhibition of p65 phosphorylation at serines 205, 276, 281, and 311 leads to impaired NF-κB activation after TNF stimulation is derived from the expression analysis of a limited number of genes (10Duran A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J.

Repression of gene expression by unphosphorylated NF-κB p65 through epigenetic mechanisms.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the dependence of NF-κB-driven gene expression on these p65 phosphorylation sites on a broader level by constitutively knocking down endogenous WT p65 in the murine endothelial cell line bEND.3 and reconstituting the resulting cell pool with a control vector, human p65 WT or S205A, S276A, S281A, and S311A. p65 knockdown as well as equal protein expression of the introduced p65 forms was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Reconstituted p65 WT followed the characteristic wave of nuclear import and export after TNF stimulation (Fig. 1B), indicating its successful functional integration into the NF-κB pathway. p65 phospho-mutant nuclear translocation after 30 min of TNF stimulation was similar to p65 WT; however, as also seen in fibroblasts (19Hochrainer K. Racchumi G. Anrather J. Hypo-phosphorylation leads to nuclear retention of NF-κB p65 due to impaired IκBα gene synthesis.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5493-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), basal nuclear p65 levels were higher in S205A-, S276A-, and S281A-expressing cells, and after 60 min of TNF stimulation, p65 S205A, S276A, and S281A were still nuclear, whereas p65 WT and the S311A mutant relocated to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, B and C). To examine global NF-κB activity in these cells, RNA was prepared, and expression of 37 NF-κB-dependent genes, meeting our selection criteria (see “Experimental Procedures”), was analyzed in resting and 3-h TNF-treated cells. As a general finding, the transcriptional activity of p65 205, 276, and 281 serine to alanine mutants was impaired, whereas p65 S311A was inducing gene expression to equal levels as p65 WT on almost all genes tested (Fig. 2). Depending on whether their expression was or was not affected by p65 phosphorylation deficiency, we subdivided the tested genes into three regulatory groups. The first group includes 11 genes, which failed to be induced by all p65 Ser-205, Ser-276, and Ser-281 mutants. All but one (Cxcl5) of these genes were equally induced by p65 WT and S311A. Group II consists of 13 genes that were efficiently induced by p65 WT, S311A and S205A mutants. Thirteen group III genes were equally induced by all p65 variants. Supporting these results, we found that protein expression of selected NF-κB-dependent genes matched the mRNA levels in p65 WT and mutant cells (Fig. 3). p65 knockdown resulted in substantial but not complete repression of endogenous p65 protein (Fig. 1A). To minimize the probability that any of our observed effects were caused by residual endogenous p65 levels, we compared mRNA expression of representative genes for each regulatory group with those from p65−/− fibroblasts reconstituted with p65 WT and mutants. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, expression profiles of all genes tested were similar in bEND.3 and 3T3 cells, except for minor variations for Cxcl10 and H2-k1, which could be cell type-specific.FIGURE 3Protein expression levels of three selected genes as observed by FACS analysis after 3 h of TNF treatment. Untreated or 3-h TNF-treated retrovirally transduced p65 WT and mutant bEND.3 cells were processed for FACS analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent mean ± S.E. (n = 3), calculated relative to the mean of unstimulated, pooled controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using isolated κB consensus sites to drive reporter gene expression, we have previously established that p65 phosphorylation-deficient forms are driving transcription in a cis-acting element-specific context (22Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. cis-Acting, element-specific transcriptional activity of differentially phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated whether the κB site preference of hypo-phosphorylated p65 mutants was also reflected in binding to endogenous gene promoters. Because the location and DNA sequence of functional κB sites has not been established for the majority of genes analyzed in this study, we restricted our analysis to selected genes of each induction group whose κB sites were functionally characterized and compared their annotated DNA sequences (Fig. 4). We found that the group affiliation of genes was largely dictated by the composition of the 5′ half-sites of the κB consensus sequence. The more guanines located in the N terminus of the κB site, the less the expression of the tested gene was susceptible to p65 Ser-to-Ala mutations. Whereas κB-binding sites in group I had preference for thymidine or maximal two guanines at the 5′ end, group II and III consensus sites were characterized by three or more guanine residues. The highest conservation was observed in group III with all but one κB site featuring four to five guanine residues at the 5′ end. In addition, all 5′ half-sites of group III genes were entirely composed of purines, a feature not as prevalent in κB sites of group I and II genes. The 3′ half-site showed higher homology spanning all groups with sites featuring two cytosines at the 3′ end preceded by two pyrimidines. In general, group I κB elements were found to be more diverse, whereas group II sites were similar, differing only in maximal two-base substitutions. Group III showed the highest homology with Cxcl10 site 2 and H2-k1, as well as H2-k1 and Nfkbie κB elements being identical except for a one-base shift. In summary, we confirm that differential p65 phosphorylation directs NF-κB activity to particular subsets of genes. The transcriptional specificity of NF-κB p65 phospho-mutants is thereby, as suggested previously (22Anrather J. Racchumi G. Iadecola C. cis-Acting, element-specific transcriptional activity of differentially phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), dictated by the structure of the κB element in the promoter of respective genes. Next, we investigated whether differential DNA-binding properties could account for differential transcriptional activities of p65 mutants by performing ChIP with a p65-specific antibody from resting, 0.5, and 3 h TNF-stimulated p65 knockdown, WT, or mutant-expressing bEND.3 cells. Maximal p65 binding was achieved after 0.5 h TNF stimulation for all p65 variants regardless of the expression profile of the corresponding gene (Fig. 5, left panel). p65 binding to gene promoters in group I was apparent for p65 WT but was markedly reduced for all p65 mutants (Fig. 5, left panel). This is in concordance with the observed gene expression patterns for p65 Ser-205, Ser-276, and Ser-281 mutants but is surprising for p65 S311A, which showed transcriptional activity comparable with the WT protein. Within group II, p65 S205A, S276A, and S311A were similarly recruited to the promoter as p65 WT, whereas p65 S281A DNA binding was impaired (Fig. 5, left panel). This suggests that reduced expression of group II genes in p65 S276A cells is not solely mediated by reduced p65 DNA binding, while the inability of the S281A mutant to be efficiently recruited to the promoter correlated well with its reduced transcriptional activity. In group III, promoter binding profiles of all p65 proteins were equal (Fig. 5, left panel), reflecting the observed mRNA expression patterns of genes belonging to this group. Because mRNA expression patterns of some genes could not be explained by p65 DNA binding properties alone, we next examined the levels of promoter-bound p-RNAP II, thought to be indicative for transcriptionally active genes (Fig. 5, right panel) (32O'Brien T. Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and transcriptional elongation.Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Similarly to p65, p-RNAP II reached maximum binding at 0.5 h after TNF addition on most promoters, but recruitment was sustained at Vcam1, Cxcl10, H2-k1, and Nfkbie promoters. We"

Here, we showed that JRAB interacts with two actin-binding proteins, actinin-1 and -4, and filamentous actin via different domains and regulates actin cross-linking and stabilization through these interactions. During epithelial junctional development, JRAB is prominently enriched in the actin bundle at the free border; subsequently, JRAB undergoes a Rab13-dependent conformational change that is required for maturation of cell-cell adhesion sites.

It is unclear how intracellular trafficking of the SUMOylation enzymes is regulated to catalyze SUMOylation in different cellular compartments. Here we report that the SAE2 subunit of human SUMO activation enzyme (SAE) underwent rapid nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and its nuclear accumulation depended on SUMO modification at the C terminus. The SUMOylation sites included three Lys residues on the bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and two Lys residues outside of but adjacent to the NLS, and their SUMOylation was catalyzed by Ubc9. Because SAE2 forms a tight heterodimer with SAE1 and it controls the trafficking of the heterodimer, this study has identified the mechanism used to localize SAE to the nucleus. Similar mechanisms are likely to exist for other proteins that depend on SUMOylation for nuclear localization.

https://openalex.org/W2023165771,"Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) disease is a rare, genetic, lysosomal disorder with progressive neurodegeneration. Poor understanding of the pathophysiology and a lack of blood-based diagnostic markers are major hurdles in the treatment and management of NPC and several additional, neurological lysosomal disorders. To identify disease severity correlates, we undertook whole genome expression profiling of sentinel organs, brain, liver, and spleen of Balb/c Npc1−/− mice relative to Npc1+/− at an asymptomatic stage, as well as early- and late-symptomatic stages. Unexpectedly, we found prominent up regulation of innate immunity genes with age-dependent change in their expression, in all three organs. We shortlisted a set of 12 secretory genes whose expression steadily increased with age in both brain and liver, as potential plasma correlates of neurological and/or liver disease. Ten were innate immune genes with eight ascribed to lysosomes. Several are known to be elevated in diseased organs of murine models of other lysosomal diseases including Gaucher’s disease, Sandhoff disease and MPSIIIB. We validated the top candidate lysozyme, in the plasma of Npc1−/− as well as Balb/c Npc1nmf164 mice (bearing a point mutation closer to human disease mutants) and show its reduction in response to an emerging therapeutic. We further established elevation of innate immunity in Npc1−/− mice through multiple functional assays including inhibition of bacterial infection as well as cellular analysis and immunohistochemistry. These data revealed neutrophil elevation in the Npc1−/− spleen and liver (where large foci were detected proximal to damaged tissue). Together our results yield a set of lysosomal, secretory innate immunity genes that have potential to be developed as pan or specific plasma markers for neurological diseases associated with lysosomal storage and where diagnosis is a major problem. Further, the accumulation of neutrophils in diseased organs (hitherto not associated with NPC) suggests their role in pathophysiology and disease exacerbation."
https://openalex.org/W1987412703,"Following exposure to microgravity, there is a reduced ability of astronauts to augment peripheral vascular resistance, often resulting in orthostatic hypotension. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mesenteric arteries and veins will exhibit diminished vasoconstrictor responses after spaceflight. Mesenteric arteries and veins from female mice flown on the Space Transportation System (STS)-131 (n=11), STS-133 (n=6), and STS-135 (n=3) shuttle missions and respective ground-based control mice (n=30) were isolated for in vitro experimentation. Vasoconstrictor responses were evoked in arteries via norepinephrine (NE), potassium chloride (KCl), and caffeine, and in veins through NE across a range of intraluminal pressures (2-12 cmH(2)O). Vasoconstriction to NE was also determined in mesenteric arteries at 1, 5, and 7 d postlanding. In arteries, maximal constriction to NE, KCl, and caffeine were reduced immediately following spaceflight and 1 d postflight. Spaceflight also reduced arterial ryanodine receptor-3 mRNA levels. In mesenteric veins, there was diminished constriction to NE after flight. The results indicate that the impaired vasoconstriction following spaceflight occurs through the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) release mechanism. Such vascular changes in astronauts could compromise the maintenance of arterial pressure during orthostatic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2161547267,"The conserved U54 in tRNA is often modified to 5-methyluridine (m(5)U) and forms a reverse Hoogsteen base pair with A58 that stabilizes the L-shaped tRNA structure. In Gram-positive and some Gram-negative eubacteria, m(5)U54 is produced by folate/FAD-dependent tRNA (m(5)U54) methyltransferase (TrmFO). TrmFO utilizes N(5),N(10)-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH(2)THF) as a methyl donor. We previously reported an in vitro TrmFO assay system, in which unstable [(14)C]CH(2)THF was supplied from [(14)C]serine and tetrahydrofolate by serine hydroxymethyltransferase. In the current study, we have improved the TrmFO assay system by optimization of enzyme and substrate concentrations and introduction of a filter assay system. Using this assay, we have focused on the tRNA recognition mechanism of TrmFO. 42 tRNA mutant variants were prepared, and experiments with truncated tRNA and microhelix RNAs revealed that the minimum requirement of TrmFO exists in the T-arm structure. The positive determinants for TrmFO were found to be the U54U55C56 sequence and G53-C61 base pair. The gel mobility shift assay and fluorescence quenching showed that the affinity of TrmFO for tRNA in the initial binding process is weak. The inhibition experiments showed that the methylated tRNA is released before the structural change process. Furthermore, we found that A38 prevents incorrect methylation of U32 in the anticodon loop. Moreover, the m(1)A58 modification clearly accelerates the TrmFO reaction, suggesting a synergistic effect of the m(5)U54, m(1)A58, and s(2)U54 modifications on m(5)s(2)U54 formation in Thermus thermophilus cells. The docking model of TrmFO and the T-arm showed that the G53-C61 base pair is not able to directly contact the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2067924179,"Adrenomedullin (AM) is a potent lymphangiogenic factor that promotes lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) proliferation through a pharmacologically tractable G-protein-coupled receptor. Numerous types of human cancers have increased levels of AM; however, the functional consequences of this fact have not been characterized. Therefore, we evaluated whether modulating adrenomedullin (Adm) gene dosage within tumor cells affects lymphangiogenesis. Murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells that overexpress or underexpress Adm were injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice, and tumors were evaluated for growth and vascularization. A dosage range from ∼10 to 200% of wild-type Adm expression did not affect LLC proliferation in vitro or in vivo, nor did it affect angiogenesis. Notably, the dosage of Adm markedly and significantly influenced tumor lymphangiogenesis. Reduced Adm expression in tumors decreased the proliferation of LECs and the number of lymphatic vessels, while elevated tumor Adm expression led to enlarged lymphatic vessels. Moreover, overexpression of Adm in tumors induced sentinel lymph node lymphangiogenesis and led to an increased incidence of Ki67-positive foci within the lung. These data show that tumor-secreted AM is a critical factor for driving both tumor and lymph node lymphangiogenesis. Thus, pharmacological targeting of AM signaling may provide a new avenue for inhibition of tumor lymphangiogenesis."

SEHC Trauma Activation Patients are compared with the Langdorf Activation Patients and with the SEHC Trauma Nonactivation Patients. Minimum Rates are positive tests divided by total patients (tested and not tested). Activation patients: The minimum alcohol rates were: SEHC 23.1%, Langdorf 28.2%, combined 24.8%. The minimum illicit drug rates were: SEHC 15.7%, Langdorf 23.5, combined 18.3%. The minimum alcohol and/or illicit drug rates were: SEHC 33.4%, Langdorf 41.8%, combined 36.2%. Nonactivation patients: The SEHC minimum alcohol rate was 4.7% and the minimum illicit drug rate was 6.0%.Alcohol and illicit drug rates were significantly greater for Trauma Activation Patients, when compared to Nonactivation Patients. At minimum, Trauma Activation Patients are likely to have a 1-in-3 positive test for alcohol and/or an illicit drug. This substantial rate suggests that Trauma Activation Patients, a readily discernible group at trauma center arrival, are appropriate for routine alcohol and illicit drug testing.

https://openalex.org/W2043693375,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released from intestinal L cells in response to nutrients has many physiological effects but particularly enhances glucose-dependent insulin release through the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). GLP-1 7-36 amide, the predominant circulating active form of GLP-1, is rapidly truncated by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 to GLP-1 9-36 amide, which is generally considered inactive. Given its physiological roles, the GLP-1R is targeted for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Recently 'compound 2' has been described as both an agonist and positive allosteric modulator of GLP-1 7-36 amide affinity, but not potency, at the GLP-1R. Importantly, we demonstrated previously that exendin 9-39, generally considered a GLP-1R antagonist, enhances compound 2 efficacy (or vice versa) at the GLP-1R. Given that GLP-1 9-36 amide is the major circulating form of GLP-1 post-prandially and is a low affinity weak partial agonist or antagonist at the GLP-1R, we investigated interaction between this metabolite and compound 2 in a cell line with recombinant expression of the human GLP-1R and the rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1E, with native expression of the GLP-1R. We show compound 2 markedly enhances efficacy and potency of GLP-1 9-36 amide for key cellular responses including AMP generation, Ca(2+) signaling and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Thus, metabolites of peptide hormones including GLP-1 that are often considered inactive may provide a means of manipulating key aspects of receptor function and a novel therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2002393791,"VRC01, a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody, is capable of neutralizing a diverse array of HIV-1 isolates by mimicking CD4 binding with the envelope glycoprotein gp120. Nonetheless, resistant strains have been identified. Here, we examined two genetically related and two unrelated envelope clones, derived from CRF08_BC-infected patients, with distinct VRC01 neutralization profiles. A total of 22 chimeric envelope clones was generated by interchanging the loop D and/or V5 regions between the original envelopes or by single alanine substitutions within each region. Analysis of pseudoviruses built from these mutant envelopes showed that interchanging the V5 region between the genetically related or unrelated clones completely swapped their VRC01 sensitivity profiles. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that the asparagine residue at position 460 (Asn-460), a potential N-linked glycosylation site in the V5 region, is a key factor for observed resistance in these strains, which is further supported by our structural modeling. Moreover, changes in resistance were found to positively correlate with deviations in VRC01 binding affinity. Overall, our study indicates that Asn-460 in the V5 region is a critical determinant of sensitivity to VRC01 specifically in these viral strains. The long side chain of Asn-460, and potential glycosylation, may create steric hindrance that lowers binding affinity, thereby increasing resistance to VRC01 neutralization."
https://openalex.org/W2007798010,"The gustatory system detects tastants and transmits signals to the brain regarding ingested substances and nutrients. Although tastant receptors and taste signaling pathways have been identified, little is known about their regulation. Because bitter, sweet, and umami taste receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), we hypothesized that regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins may be involved. The recent cloning of RGS21 from taste bud cells has implicated this protein in the regulation of taste signaling; however, the exact role of RGS21 has not been precisely defined. Here, we sought to determine the role of RGS21 in tastant responsiveness. Biochemical analyses confirmed in silico predictions that RGS21 acts as a GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) for multiple G protein α subunits, including adenylyl cyclase-inhibitory (Gα(i)) subunits and those thought to be involved in tastant signal transduction. Using a combination of in situ hybridization, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence, we demonstrate that RGS21 is not only endogenously expressed in mouse taste buds but also in lung airway epithelial cells, which have previously been shown to express components of the taste signaling cascade. Furthermore, as shown by reverse transcription-PCR, the immortalized human airway cell line 16HBE was found to express transcripts for tastant receptors, RGS21, and downstream taste signaling components. Over- and underexpression of RGS21 in 16HBE cells confirmed that RGS21 acts to oppose bitter tastant signaling to cAMP and calcium second messenger changes. Our data collectively suggests that RGS21 modulates bitter taste signal transduction."

In the present study, facial resemblance was manipulated by morphing stimulus faces with the participants' own faces or control faces (resulting in self-resemblant or other-resemblant composite faces). A norming study showed that the perceived degree of kinship was higher for the participants and the self-resemblant composite faces than for actual first-degree relatives. Effects of facial self-resemblance on trust and cooperation were tested in a paradigm that has proven to be sensitive to facial trustworthiness, facial likability, and facial expression. First, participants played a cooperation game in which the composite faces were shown. Then, likability ratings were assessed. In a source memory test, participants were required to identify old and new faces, and were asked to remember whether the faces belonged to cooperators or cheaters in the cooperation game. Old-new recognition was enhanced for self-resemblant faces in comparison to other-resemblant faces. However, facial self-resemblance had no effects on the degree of cooperation in the cooperation game, on the emotional evaluation of the faces as reflected in the likability judgments, and on the expectation that a face belonged to a cooperator rather than to a cheater. Therefore, the present results are clearly inconsistent with the assumption of an evolved kin recognition module built into the human face recognition system."

The protease-activated receptor (PAR)-2, which is expressed in numerous cell types in lung tissue, is known to mediate the cellular events caused by inhaled serine protease. Alveolar macrophages express PAR-2 and produce considerable amounts of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. We determined whether the serine protease in German cockroach extract (GCE) enhances TNF-α production by alveolar macrophages through the PAR-2 pathway and whether the TNF-α production affects GCE-induced pulmonary inflammation. Effects of GCE on alveolar macrophages and TNF-α production were evaluated using in vitro MH-S and RAW264.6 cells and in vivo GCE-induced asthma models of BALB/c mice. GCE contained a large amount of serine protease. In the MH-S and RAW264.7 cells, GCE activated PAR-2 and thereby produced TNF-α. In the GCE-induced asthma model, intranasal administration of GCE increased airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), inflammatory cell infiltration, productions of serum immunoglobulin E, interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13 and TNF-α production in alveolar macrophages. Blockade of serine proteases prevented the development of GCE induced allergic pathologies. TNF-α blockade also prevented the development of such asthma-like lesions. Depletion of alveolar macrophages reduced AHR and intracellular TNF-α level in pulmonary cell populations in the GCE-induced asthma model.

Bacterial defense against oxidative stress relies on a variety of antioxidant defense enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxiredoxin (Prx) (2.Miller R.A. Britigan B.E. Role of oxidants in microbial pathophysiology.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 1-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, peroxiredoxins are a family of cysteine-based peroxidases, which are also called alkyl hydroperoxidase subunit C (AhpC) in a number of bacteria (3.Hall A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins-structures, mechanisms and functions.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Typical 2-Cys Prxs that have two conserved catalytic cysteines, peroxidatic (CP) and resolving (CR) cysteines, are the largest group of Prxs. CP reacts with a peroxide and forms a cysteine sulfenic acid intermediate (CP-SOH), which is followed by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond with CR from another subunit. Disulfide-bonded Prxs are subsequently reduced and reactivated by thiol-containing reductants such as thioredoxin (Trx) and alkyl hydroperoxidase subunit F (AhpF) (3.Hall A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins-structures, mechanisms and functions.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Occasionally, the intermediate CP-SOH can be overoxidized to sulfinic (CP-SO2H) or sulfonic (CP-SO3H) acids by reacting with additional peroxides, which prevent disulfide formation and hence provoke the inactivation of the enzyme (3.Hall A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins-structures, mechanisms and functions.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This overoxidation depends on the structural GGLG and YF motifs observed originally in eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs such as human Prx1 (hPrx1) (4.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Peroxiredoxin evolution and the regulation of hydrogen peroxide signaling.Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar), which, thereby, have been termed sensitive Prxs. Bacterial 2-Cys Prxs, such as AhpC from Salmonella typhimurium (StAhpC), lack the GGLG and YF motifs, rarely undergo overoxidation, and are prototypes of robust Prxs (3.Hall A. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins-structures, mechanisms and functions.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Recently, however, 2-Cys Prxs from Helicobacter pylori and cyanobacteria have been identified to be sensitive to overoxidation (5.Huang C.H. Chuang M.H. Wu Y.H. Chuang W.C. Jhuang P.J. Chiou S.H. Characterization of site-specific mutants of alkylhydroperoxide reductase with dual functionality from Helicobacter pylori.J.

Cyanobacterial 2-Cys peroxiredoxins sensitive to oxidative stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34485-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a computational search for the conserved GGLG (or similar) motif in the sequences of more than 3500 putative Prxs predicted a large number of sensitive 2-Cys Prxs widespread among bacteria (7.Nelson K.J. Knutson S.T. Soito L. Klomsiri C. Poole L.B. Fetrow J.S. Analysis of the peroxiredoxin family. Using active-site structure and sequence information for global classification and residue analysis.Proteins. 2011; 79: 947-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the coexistence of both robust and sensitive 2-Cys Prxs along with their distinct roles in a single bacterium has not been yet addressed. A 2-Cys Prx, which is a homologue of StAhpC from a foodborne pathogen Vibrio vulnificus, designated as Prx1 (formerly VvAhpC), was identified previously (8.Baek W.K. Lee H.S. Oh M.H. Koh M.J. Kim K.S. Choi S.H. Identification of the Vibrio vulnificus ahpC1 gene and its influence on survival under oxidative stress and virulence.J. Microbiol. 2009; 47: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Prx1, forming an NAD(P)H-dependent peroxide reductase system with AhpF, contributes to the growth and survival of the pathogen under exogenous oxidative stress. Here we present the characterization of another 2-Cys Prx of V. vulnificus, Prx2, in comparison with Prx1. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the two Prxs are different in sensitivities to overoxidation, expression patterns, and kinetic properties, and thereby play distinct roles in protecting the pathogen from oxidative stress of different levels and different sources. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Unless otherwise noted, the V. vulnificus strains were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 2.0% (w/v) NaCl (LBS) at 30 °C. Anerobic conditions were obtained by using an anaerobic culture jar with AnaeroGen (Oxoid) (9.Miller P.H. Wiggs L.S. Miller J.M. Evaluation of AnaeroGen system for growth of anaerobic bacteria.J.

The amplified PCR products were cloned into a His6 tag expression vector, pHIS-parallel1, containing a recombinant tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (11.Sheffield P. Garrard S. Derewenda Z.

Proteins were expressed, purified, and His6 tags were removed from the proteins using the recombinant tobacco etch virus protease as described elsewhere (12.Kim Y. Kim B.S. Park Y.J. Choi W.C.

Cysteine 50 (Cys-50) or cysteine 171 (Cys-171) of Prx2 was replaced with serine by use of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (12.Kim Y. Kim B.S. Park Y.J. Choi W.C. Hwang J.

The complementary mutagenic primers listed in Table 2 were used in conjunction with the plasmid pOH046 (as a template DNA) to create pOH049 (for Prx2-C50S) and pOH050 (for Prx2-C171S) (Table 1). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described above. Peroxidase activities of Prx2 and mutant Prx2s were measured by the modified method of Jeong et al. (13.Jeong W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Thioredoxin-dependent hydroperoxide peroxidase activity of bacterioferritin comigratory protein (BCP) as a new member of the thiol-specific antioxidant protein (TSA)/alkyl hydroperoxide peroxidase C (AhpC) family.J.

Briefly, the reaction was initiated by adding of 5 μl of 1 mm NADPH as an electron donor to 500 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.5 μm TrR, 1 μm TrxA, 5 μm Prx2 (or mutant Prx2s), and either 100 μm H2O2 or 100 μm tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)). At time intervals, 50-μl aliquots were removed, added to 950 μl of ferrous oxidation xylenol 1 (14.Wolff S.P. Ferrous ion oxidation in presence of ferric ion indicator xylenol orange for measurement of hydroperoxides.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) reagent, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and then A560 was scored by Tecan Infinite M200 reader (Tecan) to quantitate the residual peroxides. Peroxidase activity of Prx2 was determined by monitoring the decrease in A340 within 13 min due to NADPH oxidation (15.Parsonage D. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B. Substrate specificity and redox potential of AhpC, a bacterial peroxiredoxin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8209-8214Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding 200 μm NADPH to the reaction mixtures (200 μl in a final volume) including 4 μm Prx2, 0.8 μm TrxA, 0.4 μm TrR, and various concentrations of H2O2 (0.1, 1 and 5 mm) in the 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) buffer with 1 mm EDTA and 150 mm ammonium sulfate. Similarly, 200 μm NADH, 4 μm Prx1, and 0.27 μm AhpF were employed to determine peroxidase activity of Prx1. Each of 4 μm Prx1 and Prx2 was reacted with 1 mm H2O2 in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 30 °C for 5 min, and then with 100 mm DTT for another 10 min. Then, the Prxs bands, resolved on SDS-PAGE, were excised, reduced with 30 mm DTT, alkylated with 100 mm iodoacetamide, and digested with an endoproteinase AspN (Sigma) as described elsewhere (16.Wagner E.

Peroxiredoxins are oxidized in vivo at the active-site cysteine during oxidative stress.Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 777-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile, and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses were carried out on a Voyager-DETM STR Biospectrometry Work station (Applied Biosystems Inc.) operating in a negative-ion reflector mode. The masses of the cleavage peptides were determined using the PeptideMass software from the ExPASy proteomics server. The purified His-tagged Prx1 and Prx2 were used to raise rabbit anti-Prx1 and anti-Prx2 polyclonal antibodies (AbFrontier) (17.Lim M.S. Kim J.A. Lim J.G. Kim B.S. Jeong K.C. Lee K.H. Choi S.H.

Sulfonylated peptides DFTFVCp(SO3H)PTEL and DFTFVCp(SO3H)PSEL corresponding to the active site of Prx1 and Prx2, respectively, were synthesized and conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and then used to raise rabbit anti-Prx1-CP-SO3H and anti-Prx2-CP-SO3H polyclonal antibodies (AbFrontier). Cultures of the wild type, prx1 (8.Baek W.K. Lee H.S. Oh M.H. Koh M.J. Kim K.S. Choi S.H.

Proteomic identification and characterization of Vibrio vulnificus proteins induced upon exposure to INT-407 intestinal epithelial cells.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 18: 968-974PubMed Google Scholar) mutants grown to log phase (A600 of 0.5) and exposed to various levels of H2O2 for 5 min were harvested to isolate total proteins. Proteins (10 μg) were resolved on SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions and immunoblotted as described previously (17.Lim M.S. Kim J.A. Lim J.G. Kim B.S. Jeong K.C. Lee K.H. Choi S.H.

Cultures of the wild type and prx2 mutant grown to log phase (A600 of 0.5) anaerobically or aerobically and exposed to various levels of H2O2 were harvested to isolate total RNAs. For Northern blot analyses, reactions were performed according to standard procedures (19.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) with 20 μg of RNA. The DNA probes PRX1P and PRX2P were prepared by labeling DNA fragments containing the prx1 and prx2 coding regions with [α-32P]dCTP, respectively, and used for hybridizations as previously described (20.Oh M.H.

To determine the kinetic parameters, Prxs, AhpFNTD, and TrxA were pre-reduced by 100 m excess of DTT and then DTT was removed as described by Parsonage et al. (15.Parsonage D. Karplus P.A. Poole L.B.

Various concentrations of H2O2 were added to the mixtures of pre-reduced Prx1 (100 nm) and AhpFNTD (5–30 μm) in the reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0), and then incubated at 25 °C. Aliquots were removed at 1-min intervals and the residual H2O2 were measured using PeroXOquantTM Quantitative Peroxide Assay kit (Thermo Scientific) to determine the initial velocities (v0) of Prx1 to reduce H2O2. Similarly, the pre-reduced Prx2 (200 nm) and TrxA (10–40 μm) were prepared and used to determine the initial velocities of Prx2 by the same procedures described above. The initial velocities were used to generate the primary and secondary Dalziel plot (22.Dalziel K. Initial steady state velocities in the evaluation of enzyme-coenzyme-substrate reaction mechanisms.Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 1706-1723Crossref Google Scholar) and obtain Vmax, Km, and kcat of the Prxs. The initial velocities of H2O2 reduction and other kinetic parameters were determined using SigmaPlot Version 10.0. Mean values and mean ± S.E. of results calculated from at least three independent experiments were reported. A database (GenBankTM CP002469 and CP002470) search for homology to the amino acid sequences deduced from Prx1, a previously identified 2-Cys Prx (8.Baek W.K. Lee H.S. Oh M.H. Koh M.J. Kim K.S. Choi S.H. Identification of the Vibrio vulnificus ahpC1 gene and its influence on survival under oxidative stress and virulence.J. Microbiol. 2009; 47: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), singled out a protein, hereafter named Prx2. Sequence analysis revealed that Prx2 is identical to a thiol-specific antioxidant protein, formerly named TsaA by current authors (18.Oh M.H. Jeong H.G. Choi S.H. Proteomic identification and characterization of Vibrio vulnificus proteins induced upon exposure to INT-407 intestinal epithelial cells.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 18: 968-974PubMed Google Scholar). TsaA was so far poorly characterized except that it contributed to the virulence of V. vulnificus (18.Oh M.H. Jeong H.G. Choi S.H. Proteomic identification and characterization of Vibrio vulnificus proteins induced upon exposure to INT-407 intestinal epithelial cells.J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 18: 968-974PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, Prx2 is comprised of 202 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 22,168 Da and a pI of 4.9. The predicted profile of the hydrophobicity (EXPASY.ch) revealed that Prx2 is a cytosolic soluble protein as observed from AhpC of other Gram-negative bacteria (23.Link A.J. Robison K. Church G.M. Comparing the predicted and observed properties of proteins encoded in the genome of Escherichia coli K-12.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1259-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Prx2 contains two catalytic cysteines, Cys-50 and Cys-171, in the tripeptide VCPs (Val-Cys-Pro) that are highly conserved in typical 2-Cys Prxs (24.Poole L.B. The catalytic mechanism of peroxiredoxins.Subcell. Biochem. 2007; 44: 61-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25.Chuang M.H. Wu M.S. Lo W.L. Lin J.T. Wong C.H. Chiou S.H. The antioxidant protein alkylhydroperoxide reductase of Helicobacter pylori switches from a peroxide reductase to a molecular chaperone function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2552-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Prx1 revealed a high level of identity (78% in amino acid sequences) with StAhpC. However, the alignment of the amino acid sequences of Prx2 to those of StAhpC and Prx1 revealed only 35 and 39% identity, respectively. Prx2 is more homologous (48% identity in amino acid sequences) to eukaryotic hPrx1 than to Prx1 and StAhpC. Furthermore, Prx2 contains GGIG and FL motifs at positions corresponding to GGLG and YF motifs of eukaryotic sensitive Prxs (Fig. 1) (4.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Peroxiredoxin evolution and the regulation of hydrogen peroxide signaling.Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, Prx2 was able to reduce H2O2 and tBHP in vitro in the presence of TrxA/TrR as electron donors, indicating that Prx2 get electrons from NADPH through the TrxA/TrR system to complete a catalytic cycle as observed in other Prxs (26.Poole L.B. Bacterial defenses against oxidants. Mechanistic features of cysteine-based peroxidases and their flavoprotein reductases.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In contrast, AhpF was not able to reduce oxidized Prx2 to reactivate its peroxidase activity as determined by NADH consumption assay (data not shown). These results indicated that Prx2 is a TrxA/TrR-dependent peroxidase. Thus, hereafter, the TrxA/TrR was used as a reducing system to further characterize the peroxidase activity of Prx2. The mutants Prx2-C50S and Prx2-C171S, in which each of the two catalytic cysteine residues was replaced with a serine, respectively, were subjected to the ferrous oxidation xylenol assay to test their peroxidase activity. The results in Fig. 2B show that neither Prx2-C50S nor Prx2-C171S was able to decompose H2O2, indicating that both cysteines are crucial for the peroxidase activity of Prx2. These results indicated that the reaction mechanism of Prx2 as a peroxidase could be similar to that of StAhpC, in which Cys-50 directly attacks peroxides as a peroxidatic cysteine, whereas Cys-171, as a resolving cysteine, reduces the resulting sulfenic acid intermediate of the Cys-50. Prx2 and Prx1 activities reducing high levels of H2O2 were determined by measuring NAD(P)H consumption. When reacted with 0.1 mm H2O2, both Prx2 and Prx1 actively consumed NAD(P)H"

Herein, we show that increased eIF expression in tumor extracts of mice after daidzein diets is associated with protein expression of mRNAs with internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) that are sensitive to eIF4E and eIF4G levels. Results with metastatic cancer cell lines show that some of the effects of daidzein in vivo can be recapitulated by the daidzein metabolite equol. In vitro, equol, but not daidzein, up-regulated eIF4G without affecting eIF4E or its regulator, 4E-binding protein (4E-BP), levels. Equol also increased metastatic cancer cell viability. Equol specifically increased the protein expression of IRES containing cell survival and proliferation-promoting molecules and up-regulated gene and protein expression of the transcription factor c-Myc. Moreover, equol increased the polysomal association of mRNAs for p 120 catenin and eIF4G. The elevated eIF4G in response to equol was not associated with eIF4E or 4E-binding protein in 5' cap co-capture assays or co-immunoprecipitations. In dual luciferase assays, IRES-dependent protein synthesis was increased by equol. Therefore, up-regulation of eIF4G by equol may result in increased translation of pro-cancer mRNAs with IRESs and, thus, promote cancer malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2044951540,"Previously, we characterized Saccharomyces cerevisiae exonuclease 5 (EXO5), which is required for mitochondrial genome maintenance. Here, we identify the human homolog (C1orf176; EXO5) that functions in the repair of nuclear DNA damage. Human EXO5 (hEXO5) contains an iron-sulfur cluster. It is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-specific bidirectional exonuclease with a strong preference for 5'-ends. After loading at an ssDNA end, hEXO5 slides extensively along the ssDNA prior to cutting, hence the designation sliding exonuclease. However, the single-stranded binding protein human replication protein A (hRPA) restricts sliding and enforces a unique, species-specific 5'-directionality onto hEXO5. This specificity is lost with a mutant form of hRPA (hRPA-t11) that fails to interact with hEXO5. hEXO5 localizes to nuclear repair foci in response to DNA damage, and its depletion in human cells leads to an increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, in particular interstrand cross-linking-inducing agents. Depletion of hEXO5 also results in an increase in spontaneous and damage-induced chromosome abnormalities including the frequency of triradial chromosomes, suggesting an additional defect in the resolution of stalled DNA replication forks in hEXO5-depleted cells."
https://openalex.org/W2093679408,"A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are a family of scaffolding proteins that target PKA and other signaling molecules to cellular compartments and thereby spatiotemporally define cellular signaling events. The AKAP18 family comprises AKAP18α, AKAP18β, AKAP18γ, and AKAP18δ. The δ isoform targets PKA and phosphodiesterase PDE4D to AQP2 (aquaporin-2)-bearing vesicles to orchestrate the acute regulation of body water balance. Therefore, AKAP18δ must adopt a membrane localization that seems at odds with (i) its lack of palmitoylation or myristoylation sites that tailor its isoforms AKAP18α and AKAP18β to membrane compartments and (ii) the high sequence identity to the preferentially cytoplasmic AKAP18γ. Here, we show that the electrostatic attraction of the positively charged amino acids of AKAP18δ to negatively charged lipids explains its membrane targeting. As revealed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, the binding constant of purified AKAP18δ fragments to large unilamellar vesicles correlates (i) with the fraction of net negatively charged lipids in the bilayer and (ii) with the total amount of basic residues in the protein. Although distantly located on the sequence, these positively charged residues concentrate in the tertiary structure and form a clear binding surface. Thus, specific recruitment of the AKAP18δ-based signaling module to membranes such as those of AQP2-bearing vesicles must be achieved by additional mechanisms, most likely compartment-specific protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1974298114,"The primer for reverse transcription in human immunodeficiency virus type 1, human tRNA(Lys,3), is selectively packaged into the virion along with tRNA(Lys1,2). Human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (hLysRS), the only cellular factor known to interact specifically with all three tRNA(Lys) isoacceptors, is also selectively packaged into HIV-1. We have previously defined a tRNA(Lys) packaging complex that includes the tRNA(Lys) isoacceptors, LysRS, HIV-1 Gag, GagPol, and viral RNA. Numerous studies support the hypothesis that during tRNA(Lys) packaging, a Gag·GagPol complex interacts with a tRNA(Lys)·LysRS complex, with Gag interacting specifically with the catalytic domain of LysRS, and GagPol interacting with both Gag and tRNA(Lys). In this work, we have identified residues along one face of the motif 1 dimerization helix (H7) of hLysRS that are critical for packaging of the synthetase into virions. Mutation of these residues affects binding to Gag in vitro, as well as the oligomerization state and aminoacylation activity of the synthetase. Taken together, these data suggest that H7 of LysRS has a dual function. In its canonical role it maintains the synthetase dimer interface, whereas in its function in tRNA primer recruitment, it bridges interactions with HIV-1 Gag."
https://openalex.org/W2038250633,"We investigated the role of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the spatiotemporal control of intracellular cAMP concentrations in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs).The rank order of PDE families contributing to global cAMP-PDE activity was PDE4> PDE3 = PDE1. PDE7 mRNA expression but not activity was confirmed. The Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based cAMP sensor, Epac1-camps, was used to monitor the time course of cytosolic cAMP changes. A pulse application of the β-adrenoceptor (β-AR) agonist isoproterenol (Iso) induced a transient FRET signal. Both β(1)- and β(2)-AR antagonists decreased the signal amplitude without affecting its kinetics. The non-selective PDE inhibitor (IBMX) dramatically increased the amplitude and delayed the recovery phase of Iso response, in agreement with a role of PDEs in degrading cAMP produced by Iso. Whereas PDE1, PDE3 and PDE7 blockades [with MIMX, cilostamide (Cil) and BRL 50481 (BRL), respectively] had no or minor effect on Iso response, PDE4 inhibition [with Ro-20-1724 (Ro)] strongly increased its amplitude and delayed its recovery. When Ro was applied concomitantly with MIMX or Cil (but not with BRL), the Iso response was drastically further prolonged. PDE4 inhibition similarly prolonged both β(1)- and β(2)-AR-mediated responses. When a membrane-targeted FRET sensor was used, PDE3 and PDE4 acted in a synergistic manner to hydrolyze the submembrane cAMP produced either at baseline or after β-AR stimulation.Our study underlines the importance of cAMP-PDEs in the dynamic control of intracellular cAMP signals in RASMCs, and demonstrates the prominent role of PDE4 in limiting β-AR responses. PDE4 inhibition unmasks an effect of PDE1 and PDE3 on cytosolic cAMP hydrolyzis, and acts synergistically with PDE3 inhibition at the submembrane compartment. This suggests that mixed PDE4/PDE1 or PDE4/PDE3 inhibitors would be attractive to potentiate cAMP-related functions in vascular cells."
https://openalex.org/W2039658062,"Conditional neuronal membrane potential oscillations have been identified as a potential mechanism to help support or generate rhythmogenesis in neural circuits. A genetically identified population of ventromedial interneurons, called Hb9, in the mouse spinal cord has been shown to generate TTX-resistant membrane potential oscillations in the presence of NMDA, serotonin and dopamine, but these oscillatory properties are not well characterized. Hb9 interneurons are rhythmically active during fictive locomotor-like behavior. In this study, we report that exogenous N-Methyl-D-Aspartic acid (NMDA) application is sufficient to produce membrane potential oscillations in Hb9 interneurons. In contrast, exogenous serotonin and dopamine application, alone or in combination, are not sufficient. The properties of NMDA-induced oscillations vary among the Hb9 interneuron population; their frequency and amplitude increase with increasing NMDA concentration. NMDA does not modulate the T-type calcium current (ICa(T)), which is thought to be important in generating locomotor-like activity, in Hb9 neurons. These results suggest that NMDA receptor activation is sufficient for the generation of TTX-resistant NMDA-induced membrane potential oscillations in Hb9 interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W1988769983,"The microRNAs (miRNAs) miR482 and miR1448 are disease resistance-related miRNAs; the former is ubiquitously distributed in seed plants whereas the latter has only been reported in Populus trichocarpa. The precursor and mature sequences of poplar miR1448 are highly homologous to those of poplar miR482, and these two miRNAs are located in one transcript as a polycistron. Therefore, we hypothesized that the MIR1448 gene may have evolved from the MIR482 gene in poplar. However, the molecular evolution patterns of this process remain unclear. In this study, utilizing cloning and Blast analysis in NCBI ESTs and whole-genome shotgun contigs (WGS) dataset, we determined that the MIR482-MIR1448 polycistron is a family-specific clustered miRNA in Salicaceae. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis illustrated that MIR1448 is the product of a tandem duplication event from MIR482. Nucleotide substitution analysis revealed that both MIR482 and MIR1448 have more rapid evolution ratios than ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes, and that compensatory mutations that occurred in the stem region of the secondary structure were the main mechanisms that drove the evolution of these MIRNA genes. Furthermore, by comparing the substitution patterns in the miRNA-target complexes of miR482 and miR1448, we inferred that co-evolution between miRNAs and their targets was the major force that drove the “duplicated MIR482” evolve to MIR1448. We propose a novel miRNA-target pairing pattern called the “frameshift targeted mechanism” to explain the gain of target genes by miR1448. The results also imply that the major role of miR482 was in resistance to disease or other stresses via NBS-LRR proteins, whereas the biological functions of miR1448 are more diverse."

We previously reported that p57/coronin-1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and the phosphorylation down-regulates the association of this protein with actin. In this study we analyzed the phosphorylation sites of p57/coronin-1 derived from HL60 human leukemic cells by MALDI-TOF-MS, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and Phos-tag® acrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with site-directed mutagenesis and identified Ser-2 and Thr-412 as major phosphorylation sites.

A diphosphorylated form of p57/coronin-1 was detected after the cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus calyculin A. We then assessed the effects of phosphorylation at Thr-412 on the association of p57/coronin-1 with actin.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation mimic (T412D) of p57/coronin-1 expressed in HEK293T cells exhibited lower affinity for actin than the wild-type or the unphosphorylation mimic (T412A) did.

Coronin, an actin-binding protein, was first purified from the actin-myosin complex in the amoeboid protozoan Dictyostelium discoideum and was so named because it was found to form a crown-like structure on the dorsal surface of the cell (1.de Hostos E.L.

This actin-binding protein is thought to play important roles in cytokinesis, cell motility, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and macropinocytosis through the regulation of assembly/disassembly of actin filaments (2.de Hostos E.L.

The return of the crown.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 421-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All seven proteins are characterized by the presence of evolutionally conserved structural domains that include tryptophan/aspartic acid repeats that are implicated in the association with actin filaments.

In addition, we also examined the relevance between phosphorylation at Thr-412 of p57/coronin-1 and its interaction with actin and found that the phosphorylation at Thr-412 down-regulated the binding of p57/coronin-1 to actin.

A monoclonal antibody specific for phospho-Thr-412 (Thr(P)-412) of human p57/coronin-1 (pT412) was newly generated by fusing PAI myeloma cells with splenocytes of BALB/c mice immunized with Cys-NGGLDpTGRRRAM phosphopeptide conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Hybridomas were selected in hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine medium, and their culture supernatants were screened for the immunized phospho-peptide. Monoclonal antibody from clone no. 12 (IgM) was used in this study. Anti-β-actin antibody and anti-mouse IgM (μ-chain-specific) were purchased from Sigma and Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse IgG and IgM were purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc. (Guildford, UK) and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA), respectively. The human p57/coronin-1 construct (pcDNA6-p57) was prepared by insertion of the full-length p57/coronin-1 cDNA from pEGFP-p57FL (29.Oku T. Kaneko Y. Murofushi K.

The nucleotide sequences of these clones were confirmed with a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the dye-terminator method. HL60 and HEK293T cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C under humidified 5% CO2. Transfection of HEK293T cells was performed by electroporation (Gene Pulsar XcellTM; Bio-Rad) as described previously (29.Oku T. Kaneko Y. Murofushi K. Seyama Y. Toyoshima S. Tsuji T.

Phosphate-affinity SDS-PAGE was performed with Phos-tag® gel containing 50 μm Phos-tag acrylamide and 0.1 mm MnCl2. Gel staining with FlamingoTM, SYPRO® Ruby, or Pro-Q® Diamond staining was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescently stained protein bands were visualized by using a Typhoon 9410 (GE Healthcare) or FluoroPhoreStar 3000 (Anatech, Tokyo, Japan) imaging system. A protein band stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue on a gel was excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin (sequencing grade; Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Phosphopeptides were isolated from total tryptic peptides using a Titansphere Phos-TiO kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan). The resulting phosphopeptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS with an AXIMA-CFRplus (Shimadzu/Kratos, Kyoto, Japan), and a subsequent database search was performed with MASCOT search engines (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). HL60 cells (5 × 106 cells) were lysed with a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. An immunoprecipitation assay was performed essentially as described previously (29.Oku T. Kaneko Y. Murofushi K. Seyama Y. Toyoshima S. Tsuji T.

Anti-p57/coronin-1 antibody (N7, 3 μg) was incubated with Dynabeads® protein G (20 μl) in a rotator for 1 h at room temperature. For the use of anti-Thr(P)-412 of p57/coronin-1 antibody (pT412, IgM), Dynabeads® protein G was first incubated with anti-mouse IgM antibody (2 μl) and then with antibody pT412 (3 μg). The conjugate of Dynabeads® protein G and antibody thus obtained was resuspended with cell lysates, and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with the same buffer to remove unbound proteins. Proteins bound to the beads were recovered by the treatment with a sample buffer for SDS-PAGE at 95 °C for 3 min. HEK293T cells transfected with cDNAs for the wild-type or mutants (T412A and T412D) of p57/coronin-1 were lysed with F-actin buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysates were mixed with F-actin (pre-formed filaments, 4 μg), and the mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 25 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant and precipitate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using anti-p57/coronin-1 (N7) and anti-β-actin antibodies. HEK293T cells were also transfected with cDNAs for the wild-type or mutants (T412A and T412D) of the C-terminal-truncated form of p57/coronin-1 fused with EGFP (EGFP-p57LZ). The cells were lysed with G-actin buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a conjugate of Dynabeads® protein G (20 μl) and anti-p57/coronin-1 antibody (N7; 3 μg). The precipitated beads were suspended in G-actin buffer and mixed with G-actin (5 μg), and the mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with the same buffer to remove unbound proteins. The proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using anti-p57/coronin-1 (N7) and anti-β-actin antibodies. Neutrophils were isolated from human peripheral blood by a combination of dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation (30.Gamble J.R.

After centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min, the cell pellet and opsonized zymosan were suspended in a small volume (0.03 ml) of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C for 0–30 min. The cells were then lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40. An immunoprecipitation and subsequent SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting were conducted as described above. To examine the actin binding activity of p57/coronin-1, we conducted a co-immunoprecipitation assay using HL60 cell lysate and anti-p57/coronin-1 antibody. When the immunoprecipitate from the lysate of untreated HL60 cells was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining, we detected a band of ∼43 kDa as well as p57/coronin-1 and IgG heavy and light chains (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The 43-kDa protein was identified as β-actin by MALDI-TOF-MS and MASCOT database searching (data not shown). It was further confirmed by immunoblotting that the 43-kDa band was β-actin (Fig. 1A, lower panel). By contrast, the 43-kDa band was not detected in the immunoprecipitate from HL60 cells that had been treated with calyculin A (Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor) and PMA (PKC activator) by either silver-staining or immunoblotting. When we utilized Pro-Q® Diamond to visualize phosphorylated proteins on the gel, p57/coronin-1 precipitated from the lysate of untreated HL60 cells was only faintly stained, whereas that of calyculin A/PMA-treated HL60 cells was intensely stained (Fig. 1B). These results suggested a negative correlation between phosphorylation and actin binding activity of p57/coronin-1; i.e. the phosphorylated form of p57/coronin-1 present in calyculin A/PMA-treated HL60 cells possessed weaker affinity for actin than the unphosphorylated form present in untreated HL60 cells. We next analyzed changes in the phosphorylation status of p57/coronin-1 by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE using Phos-tag® acrylamide (Phos-tag-PAGE) after the cells were treated with calyculin A and/or PMA. When the lysates of untreated HL60 cells were separated by these two procedures, p57/coronin-1 was detected as a single spot in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A) and as a single band in Phos-tag-PAGE (Fig. 2B), respectively. From the lysate of calyculin A-treated HL60 cells, in contrast, the p57/coronin-1 was detected as two spots in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and as doublet bands in Phos-tag-PAGE. The results suggest that the calyculin A treatment resulted in the appearance of the phosphorylated form of p57/coronin-1. The HL60 cells treated with PMA, however, gave spot/band profiles similar to those of untre"

https://openalex.org/W1982952475,"Within the ischemic penumbra, blood flow is sufficiently reduced that it results in hypoxia severe enough to arrest physiological function. Nevertheless, it has been shown that cells present within this region can be rescued and resuscitated by restoring perfusion and through other protective therapies. Thus, the early detection of the ischemic penumbra can be exploited to improve outcomes after focal ischemia. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 is a transcription factor induced by a reduction in molecular oxygen levels. Although the role of HIF-1 in the ischemic penumbra remains unknown, there is a strong correlation between areas with HIF-1 activity and the ischemic penumbra. We recently developed a near-infrared fluorescently labeled-fusion protein, POH-N, with an oxygen-dependent degradation property identical to the alpha subunit of HIF-1. Here, we conduct in vivo imaging of HIF-active regions using POH-N in ischemic brains after transient focal cerebral ischemia induced using the intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion technique in mice. The results demonstrate that POH-N enables the in vivo monitoring and ex vivo detection of HIF-1-active regions after ischemic brain injury and suggest its potential in imaging and drug delivery to HIF-1-active areas in ischemic brains."
