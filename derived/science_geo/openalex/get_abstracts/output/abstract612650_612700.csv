https://openalex.org/W2801080873,"The Antarctic Ice Sheet is an important indicator of climate change and driver of sea-level rise. Here we combine satellite observations of its changing volume, flow and gravitational attraction with modelling of its surface mass balance to show that it lost 2,720 ± 1,390 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2017, which corresponds to an increase in mean sea level of 7.6 ± 3.9 millimetres (errors are one standard deviation). Over this period, ocean-driven melting has caused rates of ice loss from West Antarctica to increase from 53 ± 29 billion to 159 ± 26 billion tonnes per year; ice-shelf collapse has increased the rate of ice loss from the Antarctic Peninsula from 7 ± 13 billion to 33 ± 16 billion tonnes per year. We find large variations in and among model estimates of surface mass balance and glacial isostatic adjustment for East Antarctica, with its average rate of mass gain over the period 1992–2017 (5 ± 46 billion tonnes per year) being the least certain."
https://openalex.org/W2807850657,"The μ-opioid receptor (μOR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and the target of most clinically and recreationally used opioids. The induced positive effects of analgesia and euphoria are mediated by μOR signalling through the adenylyl cyclase-inhibiting heterotrimeric G protein Gi. Here we present the 3.5 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the μOR bound to the agonist peptide DAMGO and nucleotide-free Gi. DAMGO occupies the morphinan ligand pocket, with its N terminus interacting with conserved receptor residues and its C terminus engaging regions important for opioid-ligand selectivity. Comparison of the μOR–Gi complex to previously determined structures of other GPCRs bound to the stimulatory G protein Gs reveals differences in the position of transmembrane receptor helix 6 and in the interactions between the G protein α-subunit and the receptor core. Together, these results shed light on the structural features that contribute to the Gi protein-coupling specificity of the µOR. A cryo-electron structure of the µ-opioid receptor in complex with the peptide agonist DAMGO and the inhibitory G protein Gi reveals structural determinants of its G protein-binding specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2808211602,"CLOVES syndrome (congenital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal naevi, scoliosis/skeletal and spinal syndrome) is a genetic disorder that results from somatic, mosaic gain-of-function mutations of the PIK3CA gene, and belongs to the spectrum of PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndromes (PROS). This rare condition has no specific treatment and a poor survival rate. Here, we describe a postnatal mouse model of PROS/CLOVES that partially recapitulates the human disease, and demonstrate the efficacy of BYL719, an inhibitor of PIK3CA, in preventing and improving organ dysfunction. On the basis of these results, we used BYL719 to treat nineteen patients with PROS. The drug improved the disease symptoms in all patients. Previously intractable vascular tumours became smaller, congestive heart failure was improved, hemihypertrophy was reduced, and scoliosis was attenuated. The treatment was not associated with any substantial side effects. In conclusion, this study provides the first direct evidence supporting PIK3CA inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy in patients with PROS."
https://openalex.org/W3102210234,"Large-scale quantum networks promise to enable secure communication, distributed quantum computing, enhanced sensing and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics through the distribution of entanglement across nodes1–7. Moving beyond current two-node networks8–13 requires the rate of entanglement generation between nodes to exceed the decoherence (loss) rate of the entanglement. If this criterion is met, intrinsically probabilistic entangling protocols can be used to provide deterministic remote entanglement at pre-specified times. Here we demonstrate this using diamond spin qubit nodes separated by two metres. We realize a fully heralded single-photon entanglement protocol that achieves entangling rates of up to 39 hertz, three orders of magnitude higher than previously demonstrated two-photon protocols on this platform 14 . At the same time, we suppress the decoherence rate of remote-entangled states to five hertz through dynamical decoupling. By combining these results with efficient charge-state control and mitigation of spectral diffusion, we deterministically deliver a fresh remote state with an average entanglement fidelity of more than 0.5 at every clock cycle of about 100 milliseconds without any pre- or post-selection. These results demonstrate a key building block for extended quantum networks and open the door to entanglement distribution across multiple remote nodes. Remote deterministic spin–spin entanglement is achieved using nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamonds and a single-photon entangling protocol, with much improved entangling rates compared to previously used two-photon protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2808421749,"The expression of co-inhibitory receptors, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, on effector T cells is a key mechanism for ensuring immune homeostasis. Dysregulated expression of co-inhibitory receptors on CD4+ T cells promotes autoimmunity, whereas sustained overexpression on CD8+ T cells promotes T cell dysfunction or exhaustion, leading to impaired ability to clear chronic viral infections and diseases such as cancer1,2. Here, using RNA and protein expression profiling at single-cell resolution in mouse cells, we identify a module of co-inhibitory receptors that includes not only several known co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3 and TIGIT) but also many new surface receptors. We functionally validated two new co-inhibitory receptors, activated protein C receptor (PROCR) and podoplanin (PDPN). The module of co-inhibitory receptors is co-expressed in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and is part of a larger co-inhibitory gene program that is shared by non-responsive T cells in several physiological contexts and is driven by the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-27. Computational analysis identified the transcription factors PRDM1 and c-MAF as cooperative regulators of the co-inhibitory module, and this was validated experimentally. This molecular circuit underlies the co-expression of co-inhibitory receptors in T cells and identifies regulators of T cell function with the potential to control autoimmunity and tumour immunity. A module of co-inhibitory T cell receptors, driven by the cytokine IL-27, is identified in mice that is regulated by the transcription factors PRDM1 and c-MAF."
https://openalex.org/W2807727258,"In soil ecosystems, microorganisms produce diverse secondary metabolites such as antibiotics, antifungals and siderophores that mediate communication, competition and interactions with other organisms and the environment1,2. Most known antibiotics are derived from a few culturable microbial taxa 3 , and the biosynthetic potential of the vast majority of bacteria in soil has rarely been investigated 4 . Here we reconstruct hundreds of near-complete genomes from grassland soil metagenomes and identify microorganisms from previously understudied phyla that encode diverse polyketide and nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene clusters that are divergent from well-studied clusters. These biosynthetic loci are encoded by newly identified members of the Acidobacteria, Verrucomicobia and Gemmatimonadetes, and the candidate phylum Rokubacteria. Bacteria from these groups are highly abundant in soils5–7, but have not previously been genomically linked to secondary metabolite production with confidence. In particular, large numbers of biosynthetic genes were characterized in newly identified members of the Acidobacteria, which is the most abundant bacterial phylum across soil biomes 5 . We identify two acidobacterial genomes from divergent lineages, each of which encodes an unusually large repertoire of biosynthetic genes with up to fifteen large polyketide and nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic loci per genome. To track gene expression of genes encoding polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases in the soil ecosystem that we studied, we sampled 120 time points in a microcosm manipulation experiment and, using metatranscriptomics, found that gene clusters were differentially co-expressed in response to environmental perturbations. Transcriptional co-expression networks for specific organisms associated biosynthetic genes with two-component systems, transcriptional activation, putative antimicrobial resistance and iron regulation, linking metabolite biosynthesis to processes of environmental sensing and ecological competition. We conclude that the biosynthetic potential of abundant and phylogenetically diverse soil microorganisms has previously been underestimated. These organisms may represent a source of natural products that can address needs for new antibiotics and other pharmaceutical compounds. Metagenomic and soil microcosm analyses identify abundant biosynthetic gene clusters in genomes of microorganisms from a northern Californian grassland ecosystem that provide a potential source for the future development of bacterial natural products."
https://openalex.org/W2808524678,"G-protein-coupled receptors comprise the largest family of mammalian transmembrane receptors. They mediate numerous cellular pathways by coupling with downstream signalling transducers, including the hetrotrimeric G proteins Gs (stimulatory) and Gi (inhibitory) and several arrestin proteins. The structural mechanisms that define how G-protein-coupled receptors selectively couple to a specific type of G protein or arrestin remain unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that the major interactions between activated rhodopsin and Gi are mediated by the C-terminal helix of the Gi α-subunit, which is wedged into the cytoplasmic cavity of the transmembrane helix bundle and directly contacts the amino terminus of helix 8 of rhodopsin. Structural comparisons of inactive, Gi-bound and arrestin-bound forms of rhodopsin with inactive and Gs-bound forms of the β2-adrenergic receptor provide a foundation to understand the unique structural signatures that are associated with the recognition of Gs, Gi and arrestin by activated G-protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2808136147,"Guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences challenge the replication, transcription, and translation machinery by spontaneously folding into G-quadruplexes, the unfolding of which requires forces greater than most polymerases can exert1,2. Eukaryotic cells contain numerous helicases that can unfold G-quadruplexes 3 . The molecular basis of the recognition and unfolding of G-quadruplexes by helicases remains poorly understood. DHX36 (also known as RHAU and G4R1), a member of the DEAH/RHA family of helicases, binds both DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes with extremely high affinity4–6, is consistently found bound to G-quadruplexes in cells7,8, and is a major source of G-quadruplex unfolding activity in HeLa cell lysates 6 . DHX36 is a multi-functional helicase that has been implicated in G-quadruplex-mediated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and is essential for heart development, haematopoiesis, and embryogenesis in mice9–12. Here we report the co-crystal structure of bovine DHX36 bound to a DNA with a G-quadruplex and a 3′ single-stranded DNA segment. We show that the N-terminal DHX36-specific motif folds into a DNA-binding-induced α-helix that, together with the OB-fold-like subdomain, selectively binds parallel G-quadruplexes. Comparison with unliganded and ATP-analogue-bound DHX36 structures, together with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, suggests that G-quadruplex binding alone induces rearrangements of the helicase core; by pulling on the single-stranded DNA tail, these rearrangements drive G-quadruplex unfolding one residue at a time. A mechanism for the unfolding of guanine-rich DNA ‘quadruplexes’ by helicases is suggested, based on the structure of a DNA-bound helicase."
https://openalex.org/W2808409755,"Mitochondrial inheritance, genome maintenance and metabolic adaptation depend on organelle fission by dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and its mitochondrial receptors. DRP1 receptors include the paralogues mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MID49 and MID51) and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF); however, the mechanisms by which these proteins recruit and regulate DRP1 are unknown. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of full-length human DRP1 co-assembled with MID49 and an analysis of structure- and disease-based mutations. We report that GTP induces a marked elongation and rotation of the GTPase domain, bundle-signalling element and connecting hinge loops of DRP1. In this conformation, a network of multivalent interactions promotes the polymerization of a linear DRP1 filament with MID49 or MID51. After co-assembly, GTP hydrolysis and exchange lead to MID receptor dissociation, filament shortening and curling of DRP1 oligomers into constricted and closed rings. Together, these views of full-length, receptor- and nucleotide-bound conformations reveal how DRP1 performs mechanical work through nucleotide-driven allostery. Cryo-electron microscopy is used to resolve the structure of human dynamin-related protein 1 co-assembled with its receptor mitochondrial dynamics protein of 49 kDa, along with an analysis of structure- and disease-based mutations."

https://openalex.org/W2996018287,"Sharing information coherently between nodes of a quantum network is fundamental to distributed quantum information processing. In this scheme, the computation is divided into subroutines and performed on several smaller quantum registers that are connected by classical and quantum channels 1 . A direct quantum channel, which connects nodes deterministically rather than probabilistically, achieves larger entanglement rates between nodes and is advantageous for distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation 2 . Here we implement deterministic state-transfer and entanglement protocols between two superconducting qubits fabricated on separate chips. Superconducting circuits 3 constitute a universal quantum node 4 that is capable of sending, receiving, storing and processing quantum information5–8. Our implementation is based on an all-microwave cavity-assisted Raman process 9 , which entangles or transfers the qubit state of a transmon-type artificial atom 10 with a time-symmetric itinerant single photon. We transfer qubit states by absorbing these itinerant photons at the receiving node, with a probability of 98.1 ± 0.1 per cent, achieving a transfer-process fidelity of 80.02 ± 0.07 per cent for a protocol duration of only 180 nanoseconds. We also prepare remote entanglement on demand with a fidelity as high as 78.9 ± 0.1 per cent at a rate of 50 kilohertz. Our results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations based on a master-equation description of the system. This deterministic protocol has the potential to be used for quantum computing distributed across different nodes of a cryogenic network. Deterministic quantum state transfer and entanglement generation is demonstrated between superconducting qubits on distant chips using single photons."
https://openalex.org/W2807097649,"We present two narratives on the future of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, from the perspective of an observer looking back from 2070. In the first scenario, greenhouse gas emissions remained unchecked, the climate continued to warm, and the policy response was ineffective; this had large ramifications in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, with worldwide impacts. In the second scenario, ambitious action was taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to establish policies that reduced anthropogenic pressure on the environment, slowing the rate of change in Antarctica. Choices made in the next decade will determine what trajectory is realized. The future of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean by 2070 is described under two scenarios, one in which action is taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and one in which no action is taken."
https://openalex.org/W2808180137,"Sleep and wake have global effects on brain physiology, from molecular changes1-4 and neuronal activities to synaptic plasticity3-7. Sleep-wake homeostasis is maintained by the generation of a sleep need that accumulates during waking and dissipates during sleep8-11. Here we investigate the molecular basis of sleep need using quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of the sleep-deprived and Sleepy mouse models of increased sleep need. Sleep deprivation induces cumulative phosphorylation of the brain proteome, which dissipates during sleep. Sleepy mice, owing to a gain-of-function mutation in the Sik3 gene 12 , have a constitutively high sleep need despite increased sleep amount. The brain proteome of these mice exhibits hyperphosphorylation, similar to that seen in the brain of sleep-deprived mice. Comparison of the two models identifies 80 mostly synaptic sleep-need-index phosphoproteins (SNIPPs), in which phosphorylation states closely parallel changes of sleep need. SLEEPY, the mutant SIK3 protein, preferentially associates with and phosphorylates SNIPPs. Inhibition of SIK3 activity reduces phosphorylation of SNIPPs and slow wave activity during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, the best known measurable index of sleep need, in both Sleepy mice and sleep-deprived wild-type mice. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of SNIPPs accumulates and dissipates in relation to sleep need, and therefore SNIPP phosphorylation is a molecular signature of sleep need. Whereas waking encodes memories by potentiating synapses, sleep consolidates memories and restores synaptic homeostasis by globally downscaling excitatory synapses4-6. Thus, the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of SNIPPs may represent a major regulatory mechanism that underlies both synaptic homeostasis and sleep-wake homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2808119477,"The end of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription cycle is strictly regulated to prevent interference between neighbouring genes and to safeguard transcriptome integrity 1 . The accumulation of Pol II downstream of the cleavage and polyadenylation signal can facilitate the recruitment of factors involved in mRNA 3'-end formation and termination 2 , but how this sequence is initiated remains unclear. In a chemical-genetic screen, human protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) isoforms were identified as substrates of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), also known as the cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9)-cyclin T1 (CycT1) complex 3 . Here we show that Cdk9 and PP1 govern phosphorylation of the conserved elongation factor Spt5 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Cdk9 phosphorylates both Spt5 and a negative regulatory site on the PP1 isoform Dis2 4 . Sites targeted by Cdk9 in the Spt5 carboxy-terminal domain can be dephosphorylated by Dis2 in vitro, and dis2 mutations retard Spt5 dephosphorylation after inhibition of Cdk9 in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing analysis indicates that Spt5 is dephosphorylated as transcription complexes traverse the cleavage and polyadenylation signal, concomitant with the accumulation of Pol II phosphorylated at residue Ser2 of the carboxy-terminal domain consensus heptad repeat 5 . A conditionally lethal Dis2-inactivating mutation attenuates the drop in Spt5 phosphorylation on chromatin, promotes transcription beyond the normal termination zone (as detected by precision run-on transcription and sequencing 6 ) and is genetically suppressed by the ablation of Cdk9 target sites in Spt5. These results suggest that the transition of Pol II from elongation to termination coincides with a Dis2-dependent reversal of Cdk9 signalling-a switch that is analogous to a Cdk1-PP1 circuit that controls mitotic progression 4 ."

https://openalex.org/W2807952608,"Background Maternal immunization is an effective strategy to protect pregnant women and their infants from vaccine-preventable diseases. Despite the recommendation of maternal influenza and more recently pertussis immunization in Australia, uptake of these vaccines has been suboptimal. A midwife delivered immunization program for pregnant women at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in South Australia commenced in April 2015. Monitoring the uptake of the current funded vaccine programs for pregnant women is limited. The study aimed to estimate maternal vaccine uptake and assess factors associated with influenza and pertussis vaccine uptake among pregnant women. Methods This prospective study was undertaken between November 2014 and July 2016 at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Following consent, demographic details and vaccination history for South Australian pregnant women who attended the antenatal clinic were collected. A standardised self-reported survey was completed during pregnancy with a follow up telephone interview at 8–10 weeks post-delivery. Results 205 women consented and completed the self-reported survey. Of the 180 pregnant women who completed the study, 76% and 81% received maternal influenza and pertussis vaccines respectively. The adjusted odds of women receiving maternal vaccines during pregnancy were significantly higher for women delivering after the implementation of the midwife delivered program compared with women who delivered babies prior to the program for both pertussis vaccination (AOR 21.17, 95% CI 6.14–72.95; p<0.001) and influenza vaccination (AOR 5.95, 95% CI 2.13–16.61, p<0.001). Women receiving a recommendation from a health care provider and first time mothers were significantly more likely to receive influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Conclusions High uptake of influenza and pertussis vaccines during pregnancy can be attained with health care provider recommendation and inclusion of maternal immunization as part of standard antenatal care. A midwife delivered maternal immunization program is a promising approach to improve maternal vaccine uptake by pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W2808325668,"Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) require a specific microenvironment, the haematopoietic niche, which regulates HSPC behaviour1,2. The location of this niche varies across species, but the evolutionary pressures that drive HSPCs to different microenvironments remain unknown. The niche is located in the bone marrow in adult mammals, whereas it is found in other locations in non-mammalian vertebrates, for example, in the kidney marrow in teleost fish. Here we show that a melanocyte umbrella above the kidney marrow protects HSPCs against ultraviolet light in zebrafish. Because mutants that lack melanocytes have normal steady-state haematopoiesis under standard laboratory conditions, we hypothesized that melanocytes above the stem cell niche protect HSPCs against ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage. Indeed, after ultraviolet-light irradiation, unpigmented larvae show higher levels of DNA damage in HSPCs, as indicated by staining of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and have reduced numbers of HSPCs, as shown by cmyb (also known as myb) expression. The umbrella of melanocytes associated with the haematopoietic niche is highly evolutionarily conserved in aquatic animals, including the sea lamprey, a basal vertebrate. During the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment, HSPCs relocated into the bone marrow, which is protected from ultraviolet light by the cortical bone around the marrow. Our studies reveal that melanocytes above the haematopoietic niche protect HSPCs from ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage in aquatic vertebrates and suggest that during the transition to terrestrial life, ultraviolet light was an evolutionary pressure affecting the location of the haematopoietic niche."
https://openalex.org/W2808268853,"Robustness of four wheat simulation model were tested with 2-year field experiments of three cultivars across a wide range of sowing dates in two different climatic regions: Faisalabad (semi-arid) and Layyah (arid), in Punjab-Pakistan. Wheat growing season temperature ranged from -0.1°C to 43°C. The wide series of sowing dates was a unique opportunity to grow the wheat in an environment which temperatures varies from -0.1°C to 43°C. The CERES-Wheat, Nwheat, CROPSIM-Wheat and APSIM-Wheat model were calibrated against the least-stressed treatment for each wheat cultivar. Overall, the four models described performance of early, optimum and late sown wheat well, but poorly described yields of very late planting dates with associated high temperatures during grain filling. The poor accuracy of simulations of yield for extreme planting dates point to the need to improve the accuracy of model simulations at the high end of the growing temperature range, especially given the expected future increases in growing season temperature. Improvement in simulation of maximum leaf area index of wheat for all models is needed. APSIM-Wheat only poorly simulated days to maturity of very and extremely late sown wheat compared to other models. Overall, there is a need of improvement in function of models to response high temperature."

Similar to other GPCRs, the released Gβγ directly activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to the production of phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3, also known as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) at the plasma membrane (9.Vanhaesebroeck B. Stephens L. Hawkins P. PI3K signalling: the path to discovery and understanding.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 (22358332): 195-20310.1038/nrm3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). This results in the recruitment of 3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and Akt to PIP3 at the plasma membrane via their respective pleckstrin-homology domains, culminating in PDK1 phosphorylation of Thr308 on Akt (Akt1). For full activation, Akt is also phosphorylated at Ser473 by mTORC2. The mechanisms governing temporal and spatial activation of Akt remain poorly understood. An emerging concept in GPCR signaling is that, in addition to the plasma membrane, GPCRs can signal from an intracellular site generally via either G proteins or β-arrestins (10.Tsvetanova N.G. Irannejad R. von Zastrow M. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling via heterotrimeric G proteins from endosomes.J. Biol.

In addition to the plasma membrane, β-adrenergic receptor 2 can couple with its cognate heterotrimeric G protein at the surface of endosomes to instigate ligand-dependent cAMP signaling (12.Tsvetanova N.G. von Zastrow M. Spatial encoding of cyclic AMP signaling specificity by GPCR endocytosis.Nat. Chem.

The protease-activated receptor 2 can couple with β-arrestin–dependent formation of multimeric signaling complexes at the surface of endosomes to mediate extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK-1/2) signaling (14.DeFea K.A.

An interesting aspect of signaling from the surface of endosomes is that it is qualitatively distinct from the signaling that is initiated at the cell surface (12.Tsvetanova N.G. von Zastrow M.

GPCR-instigated Akt signaling has also been linked to the surface of endosomes (15.Nazarewicz R.R. Salazar G. Patrushev N. San Martin A. Hilenski L. Xiong S. Alexander R.W. Early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) is an obligate scaffold for angiotensin II-induced, PKC-α-dependent Akt activation in endosomes.J. Biol.

Here, we provide evidence that endocytosis and endosomal protein early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), but not adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine-interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper 1 (APPL1), are required for CXCR4- and CXCR5-promoted Akt activation and signaling. Endocytosis or EEA1 specifies chemokine-instigated phosphorylation of certain Akt substrates but not others. Importantly, EEA1 is required for chemokine-instigated suppression of apoptosis in detached cells but not in adherent cells. Our data are consistent with endosomes specifying context-specific chemokine signaling that is relevant to suppression of the cancer-related process known as anoikis or anchorage-independent cell death. CXCL12 binding to its cognate receptor, CXCR4, activates many signaling pathways, including the ERK-1/2 and Akt signaling pathways (1.Raman D. Baugher P.J. Thu Y.M. Richmond A.

Previously, we reported that CXCR4-mediated activation of ERK-1/2 does not require endocytosis (17.Malik R. Soh U.J. Trejo J. Marchese A.

However, whether endocytosis is required for activation of Akt remains an open question. To address this, HeLa cells were treated with dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin, a GTPase that is required for endocytosis (18.Schmid S.L.

Cell Biol. 2017; 216 (28674108): 2623-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and is often used to inhibit GPCR endocytosis (19.Godbole A. Lyga S. Lohse M.J. Calebiro D. Internalized TSH receptors en route to the TGN induce local Gs-protein signaling and gene transcription.Nat.

Dynasore treatment of HeLa cells attenuated CXCL12 internalization of CXCR4 (Fig. 1A). To examine whether dynasore treatment impacted CXCR4-mediated activation of Akt, HeLa cells were serum-starved for 3 h and then treated with 10 nm CXCL12 or vehicle for 5 min. Akt activation was assessed by immunoblotting to detect phosphorylation of Akt at serine residue 473 using a phosphospecific antibody as we have described previously (8.Verma R. Marchese A. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport pathway mediates chemokine receptor CXCR4-promoted lysosomal degradation of the mammalian target of rapamycin antagonist DEPTOR.J. Biol.

Dynasore treatment significantly attenuated CXCL12-instigated phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 (pAkt-Ser473) by ∼50% compared with control (Fig. 1, B and quantified in C). Dynasore treatment did not impact ERK-1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, B and quantified in D), indicating that dynasore does not globally impact signaling and confirming our previous results that endocytosis is not required for CXCR4-mediated ERK-1/2 activation (17.Malik R. Soh U.J. Trejo J. Marchese A. Novel roles for the E3 ubiquitin ligase atrophin-interacting protein 4 and signal transduction adaptor molecule 1 in G protein-coupled receptor signaling.J. Biol.

These data suggest that CXCR4-mediated activation of Akt, in part, requires endocytosis. To determine how broadly applicable the requirement for endocytosis is in chemokine receptor–instigated Akt activation, we examined CXCL13, the sole cognate ligand for the chemokine receptor CXCR5 (3.Lacalle R.A. Blanco R. Carmona-Rodríguez L. Martín-Leal A. Mira E. Mañes S. Chemokine receptor signaling and the hallmarks of cancer.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2017; 331 (28325212): 181-24410.1016/bs.ircmb.2016.09.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This receptor is expressed endogenously in HeLa cells (21.Nagaraj N. Wisniewski J.R. Geiger T. Cox J. Kircher M. Kelso J. Pääbo S. Mann M. Deep proteome and transcriptome mapping of a human cancer cell line.Mol. Syst.

Similar to CXCR4, CXCR5 couples with a pertussis toxin–sensitive heterotrimeric G protein to phosphorylate Akt or ERK-1/2 (Fig. 2, C and quantified in D and E, respectively). HeLa cells also express the CXC chemokine receptors CXCR7 (also known as ACKR3) and CXCR3 (21.Nagaraj N. Wisniewski J.R. Geiger T. Cox J. Kircher M. Kelso J. Pääbo S. Mann M.

Biol. 2011; 7 (22068331): 54810.1038/msb.2011.81Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar); however, treatment of HeLa cells with CXCL11 or CXCL10, ligands for these receptors, respectively, did not significantly promote phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 2, F and quantified in G). We focused on CXCL13 signaling via CXCR5 for further experiments. Similar to CXCL12 (Fig. 1A), dynasore treatment of HeLa cells significantly attenuated CXCL13 internalization of CXCR5 (Fig. 3A) and phosphorylation of Akt, but not ERK-1/2, by CXCL13 (Fig. 3, B and quantified in C and D, respectively). To determine whether the requirement for endocytosis was restricted to HeLa cells, we examined chemokine-mediated phosphorylation of Akt in WEHI-231 cells, a B-lymphoma cell line that expresses CXCR4 and CXCR5 (22.Keppler S.J.

Dynasore treatment of WEHI-231 cells significantly attenuated CXCL12- or CXCL13-instigated phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4, A and quantified in B).

To examine whether endocytosis impacts Akt signaling, we examined the phosphorylation status of Akt substrates FoxO1/3a, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) (7.Manning B.D. Toker A. AKT/PKB signaling: navigating the network.Cell. 2017; 169 (28431241): 381-40510.1016/j.cell.2017.04.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylates FoxO1/3a at Thr24/32, GSK3β at Ser9, and TSC2 at Thr1462 (7.Manning B.D. Toker A.

Dynasore treatment significantly attenuated CXCL12- or CXCL13-instigated phosphorylation of FoxO1/3a but not TSC2 or GSK3β (Fig. 3, B and quantified in E, F, and G, respectively). Taken together, these data suggest that endocytosis specifies Akt substrate phosphorylation downstream of chemokine receptor signaling. Given that endocytosis is required for CXCR4-mediated Akt signaling, we next addressed whether endosomes are also required. Rab5-positive endosomes containing the Rab5-effector protein APPL1 have been linked to Akt signaling (23.Lin D.C. Quevedo C. Brewer N.E. Bell A. Testa J.R. Grimes M.L. Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R.

Depletion of APPL1 with two discrete siRNAs significantly attenuated insulin-instigated phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 (Fig. 5, A and quantified in B), consistent with a role of APPL1 in Akt signaling (25.Schenck A.

In contrast, depletion of APPL1 did not impact CXCL12- or epidermal growth factor (EGF)-instigated phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 5, A and quantified in B). These results reveal that APPL1 is not required for CXCR4-mediated Akt activation. A second class of Rab5-positive endosomes contains the Rab5-effector EEA1 (28.Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. The Rab5 effector EEA1 is a core component of endosome docking.Nature. 1999; 397 (10050856): 621-62510.1038/17618Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). EEA1-positive endosomes have been previously linked to GPCR-mediated Akt signaling (15.Nazarewicz R.R. Salazar G. Patrushev N. San Martin A. Hilenski L. Xiong S. Alexander R.W. Early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) is an obligate scaffold for angiotensin II-induced, PKC-α-dependent Akt activation in endosomes.J. Biol.

Depletion of EEA1 with two discrete siRNAs significantly attenuated CXCL12-instigated phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 (Fig. 6, A and quantified in B). Phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 was not impacted by EEA1 depletion (Fig. 6, A and quantified in D), indicating that there was not a global defect in signaling. Furthermore, depleting EEA1 attenuated CXCL12-instigated signaling to Akt substrate FoxO1/3a but not GSK3β or TSC2 (Fig. 6, A and quantified in C and D, respectively). Together these data suggest that EEA1-positive, but not APPL1-positive, endosomes specify discrete Akt substrate phosphorylation downstream of CXCR4 signaling. Akt promotes cell survival by suppressing apoptosis via directly phosphorylating and inactivating proapoptotic proteins (7.Manning B.D. Toker A. AKT/PKB signaling: navigating the network.Cell. 2017; 169 (28431241): 381-40510.1016/j.cell.2017.04.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). CXCR4-mediated Akt signaling has been linked to cell survival, which is key to its role in metastatic disease (29.Zhang X.H. Wang Q. Gerald W. Hudis C.A. Norton L. Smid M. Foekens J.A. Massagué J. Latent bone metastasis in breast cancer tied to Src-dependent survival signals.Cancer Cell. 2009; 16 (19573813): 67-7810.1016/j.ccr.2009.05.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). This is especially relevant when tumor cells detach and transit the bloodstream to distant sites. Typically, upon detachment, cells undergo anchorage-independent cell death or apoptosis known as anoikis (30.Frisch S.M. Francis H. Disruption of epithelial cell-matrix interactions induces apoptosis.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124 (8106557): 619-62610.1083/jcb.124.4.619Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar). Because EEA1 is required for Akt signaling, we tested whether EEA1 is required for suppression of apoptosis by CXCR4 in detached or adherent cells. In control siRNA cells that were maintained in an adherent setting, CXCL12 reduced PARP cleavage, a hallmark of apoptosis. In detached cells, cleaved PARP was somewhat elevated compared with adherent cells, suggesting greater apoptosis. Importantly, the ability of CXCL12 to reduce PARP cleavage was similar or not statistically significant between adherent and detached cells (Fig. 7, A and quantified in B). In EEA1-depleted cells, basal levels of cleaved PARP were higher than in control cells, suggesting active apoptosis. Importantly, CXCL12 significantly reduced PARP cleavage in adherent cells but not in detached cells (Fig. 7, A and quantified in B). To further confirm these findings, in parallel samples we quantified caspase-3/7 activity using a luminescence assay. In control siRNA cells, the ability of CXCL12 to reduce caspase-3/7 activity was not significantly different between adherent and detached cells (Fig. 7C). In contrast, EEA1 depletion significantly attenuated the ability of CXCL12 to reduce caspase-3/7 activity in detached cells but not in adherent cells (Fig. 7C). These results are consistent with EEA1 being required for CXCR4-mediated suppression of apoptosis. Our study provides mechanistic insight into which chemokine receptors activate Akt signaling. Our data reveal that CXCR4-mediated Akt activation and signaling require endocytosis and the Rab5-effector EEA1 but not APPL1, suggesting a role for EEA1-positive endosomes in Akt signaling. This is likely broadly applicable to other chemokine receptors because CXCL13, the cognate ligand for the chemokine receptor CXCR5, also requires endocytosis for Akt signaling. This is not cell type–dependent because, in addition to HeLa cells, endocytosis is also required for CXCR4- or CXCR5-mediated Akt ac"
https://openalex.org/W2808070226,"Background Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) is a three-item clinical instrument for bedside identification of sepsis patients at risk of poor outcome. qSOFA could be a valuable triage tool in emergency departments of low-income countries, yet its performance in resource-limited settings remains unknown. The prognostic accuracy of qSOFA for 28-day all-cause mortality in febrile adults treated at the EDs in a low-income country was evaluated. Methods Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients (≥18 years) with fever (tympanic temperature ≥38°C and fever ≤7 days) who presented between July 2013 and May 2014 at four emergency departments in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Medical history, clinical examination, laboratory and microbiological data were collected to document the cause of fever. Variables for the previous and new sepsis criteria were collected at inclusion and qSOFA, SOFA and SIRS were measured at inclusion. Patients were followed up by phone at day 28. The performance (sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC]) of qSOFA (score ≥2), SOFA (increase of ≥2 points) and SIRS (≥2 criteria) as predictors of 28-day all-cause mortality was evaluated. Results Among the 519 patients (median age: 30 years) included in the analysis, 47% were female and 25% were HIV positive. Overall, 85% had a microbiologically and/or clinically documented infection and 15% a fever of unknown origin. The most common site and causes of infections were the respiratory tract (43%), dengue (26%), malaria (6%) and typhoid fever (5%). Twenty-eight-day all-cause mortality was 6%: 3% for patients with a qSOFA <2 and 24% for those with a score ≥2 (absolute difference, 21%; 95% CI 12%-31%). The prognostic accuracy of qSOFA (AUROC 0.80, 95% CI 0.73–0.87) for 28-day mortality was similar to SOFA (AUROC 0.79, 0.71–0.87; p = 0.1) and better than SIRS (AUROC 0.61, 0.52–0.71; p<0.001). Conclusions Among patients with fever at emergency departments in Tanzania, qSOFA had a prognostic accuracy for 28-day mortality comparable to SOFA and superior to SIRS. These results support the use of qSOFA as a triage tool to identify patients with sepsis and at risk of poor outcome in resource-limited countries.

However, efforts to predict the future evolution of the EAIS are hindered by uncertainty in how it responded to past warm periods, for example, during the Pliocene epoch (5.3 to 2.6 million years ago), when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were last higher than 400 parts per million. Geological evidence indicates that some marine-based portions of the EAIS and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreated during parts of the Pliocene1,2, but it remains unclear whether ice grounded above sea level also experienced retreat. This uncertainty persists because global sea-level estimates for the Pliocene have large uncertainties and cannot be used to rule out substantial terrestrial ice loss 3 , and also because direct geological evidence bearing on past ice retreat on land is lacking. Here we show that land-based sectors of the EAIS that drain into the Ross Sea have been stable throughout the past eight million years. We base this conclusion on the extremely low concentrations of cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al isotopes found in quartz sand extracted from a land-proximal marine sediment core. This sediment had been eroded from the continent, and its low levels of cosmogenic nuclides indicate that it experienced only minimal exposure to cosmic radiation, suggesting that the sediment source regions were covered in ice. These findings indicate that atmospheric warming during the past eight million years was insufficient to cause widespread or long-lasting meltback of the EAIS margin onto land. We suggest that variations in Antarctic ice volume in response to the range of global temperatures experienced over this period-up to 2-3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures 4 , corresponding to future scenarios involving carbon dioxide concentrations of between 400 and 500 parts per million-were instead driven mostly by the retreat of marine ice margins, in agreement with the latest models5,6."
https://openalex.org/W2808376252,"The analyses of geographic variations in the prevalence of major chronic conditions, such as overweight and obesity, are an important public health tool to identify “hot spots” and inform allocation of funding for policy and health promotion campaigns, yet rarely performed. Here we aimed at exploring, for the first time in Luxembourg, potential geographic patterns in overweight/obesity prevalence in the country, adjusted for several demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural and health status characteristics. Data came from 720 men and 764 women, 25–64 years old, who participated in the European Health Examination Survey in Luxembourg (2013–2015). To investigate the geographical variation, geo-additive semi-parametric mixed model and Bayesian modelisations based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for inference were performed. Large disparities in the prevalence of overweight and obesity were found between municipalities, with the highest rates of obesity found in 3 municipalities located in the South-West of the country. Bayesian approach also underlined a nonlinear effect of age on overweight and obesity in both genders (significant in men) and highlighted the following risk factors: 1. country of birth for overweight in men born in a non-European country (Posterior Odds Ratio (POR): 3.24 [1.61–8.69]) and women born in Portugal (POR: 2.44 [1.25–4.43]), 2. low educational level (secondary or below) for overweight (POR: 1.66 (1.06–2.72)] and obesity (POR:2.09 [1.05–3.65]) in men, 3. single marital status for obesity in women (POR: 2.20 [1.24–3.91]), 4.fair (men: POR: 3.19 [1.58–6.79], women: POR: 2.24 [1.33–3.73]) to very bad health perception (men: POR: 15.01 [2.16–98.09]) for obesity, 5. sleeping more than 6 hours for obesity in unemployed men (POR: 3.66 [2.02–8.03]). Protective factors highlighted were: 1. single marital status against overweight (POR: [0.60 (0.38–0.96)]) and obesity (POR: 0.39 [0.16–0.84]) in men, 2. the fact to be widowed against overweight in women (POR: [0.30 (0.07–0.86)], as well as a non European country of birth (POR: 0.49 [0.19–0.98]), tertiary level of education (POR: 0.34 [0.18–0.64]), moderate alcohol consumption (POR: 0.54 [0.36–0.90]) and aerobic physical activity practice (POR: 0.44 [0.27–0.77]) against obesity in women. A double burden of environmental exposure due to historic mining and industrial activities and past economic vulnaribility in the South-West of the country may have participated to the higher prevalence of obesity found in this region. Other demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural and health status covariates could have been involved as well."
https://openalex.org/W2808687147,"Transfusion-transmitted leishmaniasis has been a concern in regions endemic for the disease. Whether immediate or delayed, the risks posed by this mode of transmission call for careful assessment. The purpose of this study was to detect Leishmania infection in blood donors living in an endemic area and to investigate progression to the disease in these individuals. Immunofluorescent antibody test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, leishmaniasis rapid test, and the polymerase chain reaction were applied to 430 donors in an initial evaluation. Of those donors with at least one positive test, 50 were reevaluated four years later by the same methods, as were 25 controls who had been negative on the same tests. In the first evaluation, Leishmania infection was detected in 41.4% (95% CI: 36.7–46.1) of donors (n = 430). None of the 75 reevaluated individuals had developed the disease, but retesting revealed positivity in at least one test in 36.0% (95% CI: 25.1–46.9) of donors. Of the 50 initially testing positive, 50% remained so on retesting. Of the 25 initially negative controls, two tested positive in the subsequent evaluation. The severity of the parasitosis and the risk of transfusion transmission warrant investigation of the potential inclusion of methods for Leishmania detection into blood banks for effective screening of infected donors."
https://openalex.org/W2807938607,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are exposed to both traditional 'Framingham' and uremia related cardiovascular risk factors that drive atherosclerotic and arteriosclerotic disease, but these cannot be differentiated using conventional ultrasound. We used ultra-high-frequency ultrasound (UHFUS) to differentiate medial thickness (MT) from intimal thickness (IT) in CKD patients, identify their determinants and monitor their progression.Fifty-four children and adolescents with CKD and 12 healthy controls underwent UHFUS measurements using 55-70MHz transducers in common carotid and dorsal pedal arteries. Annual follow-up imaging was performed in 31 patients.CKD patients had higher carotid MT and dorsal pedal IT and MT compared to controls. The carotid MT in CKD correlated with serum phosphate (p<0.001, r = 0.42), PTH (p = 0.03, r = 0.36) and mean arterial pressure (p = 0.03, r = 0.34). Following multivariable analysis, being on dialysis, serum phosphate levels and mean arterial pressure remained the only independent predictors of carotid MT (R2 64%). Transplanted children had lower carotid and dorsal pedal MT compared to CKD and dialysis patients (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01 respectively). At 1-year follow-up, transplanted children had a decrease in carotid MT (p = 0.01), but an increase in dorsal pedal IT (p = 0.04) that independently correlated with annualized change in BMI.Using UHFUS, we have shown that CKD is associated with exclusively medial arterial changes that attenuate when the uremic milieu is ameliorated after transplantation. In contrast, after transplantation intimal disease develops as hypertension and obesity become prevalent, representing rapid vascular remodeling in response to a changing cardiovascular risk factor profile."
https://openalex.org/W2808622112,"Background Cash and in-kind incentives can improve health outcomes in various settings; however, there is concern that incentives may ‘crowd out’ intrinsic motivation to engage in beneficial behaviors. We examined this hypothesis in a randomized trial of food and cash incentives for people living with HIV infection in Tanzania. Methods We analyzed data from 469 individuals randomized to one of three study arms: standard of care, short-term cash transfers, or short-term food assistance. Eligible participants were: 1) ≥18 years old; 2) HIV-infected; 3) food insecure; and 4) initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) ≤90 days before the study. Food or cash transfers, valued at ~$11 per month and conditional on attending clinic visits, were provided for ≤6 months. Intrinsic motivation was measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months using the autonomous motivation section of the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ). We compared the change in TSRQ score from baseline to 6 and 12 months and the change within study arms. Results The mean intrinsic motivation score was 2.79 at baseline (range: 1–3), 2.91 at 6 months (range: 1–3), and 2.95 at 12 months (range: 2–3), which was 6 months after the incentives had ended. Among all patients, the intrinsic motivation score increased by 0.13 points at 6 months (95% CI (0.09, 0.17), Cohen’s d = 0.29) and 0.19 points at 12 months (95% CI (0.14, 0.24), Cohen’s d = 0.49). Intrinsic motivation also increased within each study group at 6 months: 0.15 points in the food arm (95% CI (0.09, 0.21), Cohen’s d = 0.37), 0.11 points in the cash arm (95% CI (0.05, 0.18), Cohen’s d = 0.25), and 0.08 points in the comparison arm (95% CI (-0.03, 0.19), Cohen’s d = 0.21); findings were similar at 12 months. Increases in motivation were statistically similar between arms at 6 and 12 months. Conclusion Intrinsic motivation for ART adherence increased significantly both overall and within the food and cash incentive arms, even after the incentive period was over. Increases in motivation did not differ by study group. These results suggest that incentive interventions for treatment adherence should not be withheld due to concerns of crowding out intrinsic motivation."
https://openalex.org/W4244509809,"Recent studies on machine learning technology have reported successful performances in some visual and auditory recognition tasks, while little has been reported in the field of olfaction. In this paper we report computational methods to predict the odor impression of a chemical from its physicochemical properties. Our predictive model utilizes nonlinear dimensionality reduction on mass spectra data and performs the clustering of descriptors by natural language processing. Sensory evaluation is widely used to measure human impressions to smell or taste by using verbal descriptors, such as ""spicy"" and ""sweet"". However, as it requires significant amounts of time and human resources, a large-scale sensory evaluation test is difficult to perform. Our model successfully predicts a group of descriptors for a target chemical through a series of computer simulations. Although the training text data used in the language modeling is not specialized for olfaction, the experimental results show that our method is useful for analyzing sensory datasets. This is the first report to combine machine olfaction with natural language processing for odor character prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2808642427,"Introduction Some major changes have occurred in emergency department (ED) organization since the early 2000s, such as the establishment of triage nurses and short-track systems. The objectives of this study were to describe the characteristics of French EDs organization and users, based on a nationwide cross-sectional survey. Methods The French Emergency Survey was a nationwide cross-sectional survey. All patients presenting to all EDs during a 24-hr period of June 2013 were included. Data collection concerned ED characteristics as well as patient characteristics. Results Among the 736 EDs in France, 734 were surveyed. Triage nurses and short-track systems were respectively implemented in 73% and 41% of general EDs. The median proportion of patients aged > 75 years was 14% and median hospitalisation rate was 20%. During the study period, 48,711 patients presented to one of the 734 EDs surveyed. Among them, 7% reported having no supplementary health or universal coverage (for people with lower incomes). Overall, 50% of adult patients had been seen by the triage nurse in less than 5 minutes, 74% had a time to first medical contact shorter than one hour and 55% had an ED length of stay shorter than 3 hours. Conclusion The French Emergency Survey is the first study to provide data on almost all EDs in France. It underlines how ED organization has been redesigned to face the increase in the annual census. French EDs appear to have a particular role for vulnerable people: age-related vulnerability and socio-economic vulnerability with an over-representation of patients without complementary health coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2804710308,"Non-invasive ventilation is increasingly used for respiratory support in preterm infants, and is associated with a lower risk of chronic lung disease. However, this mode is often not successful in the extremely preterm infant in part due to their markedly increased chest wall compliance that does not provide enough structure against which the forces of inhalation can generate sufficient pressure. To address the continued challenge of studying treatments in this fragile population, we developed a nonlinear lumped-parameter model of respiratory system mechanics of the extremely preterm infant that incorporates nonlinear lung and chest wall compliances and lung volume parameters tuned to this population. In particular we developed a novel empirical representation of progressive volume loss based on compensatory alveolar pressure increase resulting from collapsed alveoli. The model demonstrates increased rate of volume loss related to high chest wall compliance, and simulates laryngeal braking for elevation of end-expiratory lung volume and constant positive airway pressure (CPAP). The model predicts that low chest wall compliance (chest stiffening) in addition to laryngeal braking and CPAP enhance breathing and delay lung volume loss. These results motivate future data collection strategies and investigation into treatments for chest wall stiffening."
https://openalex.org/W2808411576,"Soil rotational tillage is an effective measure to overcome the problems caused by long-term of a single tillage, but the effect of the interval time of rotational tillage practices is not very well understood. Therefore, we conducted a 3-year field study in a wheat-maize cropping system to evaluate the effects of rotary tillage (RT) in rotation with plowing tillage (PT) on soil properties in northern China. Four practices were designed as follows: 3 years of RT to a depth of 10-15 cm (3RT), 3 years of PT to a depth of 30-35 cm (3PT), 1 year of PT followed by 2 years of RT (PT+2RT), and 2 years of PT followed by 1 year of RT (2PT+RT). Within 20 cm of the surface soil, the 3RT treatment significantly increased the soil quality index (SQI) by 6.0%, 8.8% and 13.1%, respectively, relative to the PT+2RT, 2PT+RT and 3PT treatments. The improvement was closely related to the significant increase in the soil organic carbon (SOC) and available nutrients concentrations in the 0-20 cm depths and the improvement of soil invertase, urease, alkaline phosphatase and catalase activities in the topsoil (0-10 cm). However, the opposite effects were observed in the subsoil (20-40 cm). Compared with the 3RT treatment, the 3PT, 2PT+RT and PT+2RT treatments decreased soil bulk density, and significantly enhanced enzyme activities, resulting in an increase in SQI of 32.6%, 24.4% and 0.7%, respectively, especially in the 3PT and 2PT+RT treatments, the difference was significant. When averaged across to all soil depths, the SQI under the 3RT and 2PT+RT treatments was much higher than that under the other treatments. The yields of wheat and maize under the 2PT+RT treatment were 15.0% and 14.3% higher than those under the 3RT treatment, respectively. The 2PT+RT treatment was the most effective tillage practice. These results suggest that RT in rotation with PT could improve soil quality in the soil profile whilst enhancing crop yield after continuous RT, and the benefits were enhanced with an interval time of one year. Therefore, the 2PT+RT treatment could act as an effective method for both soil quality and crop yield improvement in a wheat-maize cropping system under straw incorporation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2808160149,"Triticum vulgare has been extensively used in traditional medicine thanks to its properties of accelerating tissue repair. The specific extract of Triticum vulgare manufactured by Farmaceutici Damor (TVE-DAMOR) is already present in some pharmaceutical formulations used in the treatment of decubitus ulcers, skin lesions and burns. It has been recently suggested that this Triticum vulgare extract may possess potential anti-inflammatory properties. In the light of these premises the aim of the present paper was to verify the anti-inflammatory role of TVE, using the LPS-stimulated microglia model of inflammation. In particular the effect of different concentrations of TVE on the release of several mediators of inflammation such as nitric oxide, IL-6, PGE2 and TNF alpha was evaluated. More important, the anti-inflammatory effect of TVE was confirmed also in primary rat microglia cultures. The results of the present study show that TVE exerts anti-inflammatory properties since it reduces the release of all the evaluated markers of inflammation, such as NO, IL6, TNF alpha and PGE2 in LPS-activated BV2 microglial cells. Intriguingly, TVE reduced microglia activation and NO release also in primary microglia. Indeed, to verify the pathway of modulation of the inflammatory markers reported above, we found that TVE restores the cytoplasmic expression of p65 protein, kwown as specific marker associated with activation of inflammatory response. The evidence for an inhibitory activity on inflammation of this specific extract of Triticum vulgare may open the way to the possibility of a therapeutical use of the Triticum vulgare extract as an anti-inflammatory compound in certain pathological states such as burns, decubitus ulcers, folliculitis and inflammation of peripheral nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2620665478,"Data generated from a system of interest typically consists of measurements from an ensemble of subjects across multiple response and covariate features, and is naturally represented by one response-matrix against one covariate-matrix. Likely each of these two matrices simultaneously embraces heterogeneous data types: continuous, discrete and categorical. Here a matrix is used as a practical platform to ideally keep hidden dependency among/between subjects and features intact on its lattice. Response and covariate dependency is individually computed and expressed through mutliscale blocks via a newly developed computing paradigm named Data Mechanics. We propose a categorical pattern matching approach to establish causal linkages in a form of information flows from patterned response dependency to structured covariate dependency. The strength of an information flow is evaluated by applying the combinatorial information theory. This unified platform for system knowledge discovery is illustrated through five data sets. In each illustrative case, an information flow is demonstrated as an organization of discovered knowledge loci via emergent visible and readable heterogeneity. This unified approach fundamentally resolves many long standing issues, including statistical modeling, multiple response, renormalization and feature selections, in data analysis, but without involving man-made structures and distribution assumptions. The results reported here enhance the idea that linking patterns of response dependency to structures of covariate dependency is the true philosophical foundation underlying data-driven computing and learning in sciences."
https://openalex.org/W2808260365,"Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) are one of the most consumed vegetables worldwide. However, tomato allergies in patients suffering from birch pollen allergy occur frequently. Due to highly similar protein structures of the tomato allergen Sola l 4 and the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1, patients cross-react with allergenic proteins from tomato as well as other fruits or vegetables. The aim of this study was to quantify Sola l 4 in various tomatoes differing in color, size and shape for identification of varieties with a reduced allergen level. Therefore, an indirect competitive ELISA using a specific polyclonal Sola l 4 antibody was developed. In addition, two varieties, both cultivated either conventionally or organically and furthermore dried with different methods, were analyzed to investigate the influence of the cultivation method and processing techniques on Sola l 4 level. Within 23 varieties, Sola l 4 content varied significantly between 0.24 and 1.71 μg Sola l 4/g FW. The tomato cultivars Rugantino and Rhianna showed the significantly lowest level, whereas in cultivars Farbini and Bambello the significantly highest concentration was determined. Drying of tomatoes in the oven and by sun resulted in a significant decrease. The thermal instability was verified for the recombinant Sola l 4 emphasizing the results for the native protein in dried tomato samples. Overall, the Sola l 4 content is cultivar-dependent and no correlation between color and Sola l 4 amount was found. During the drying process of tomatoes Sola l 4 level was significantly reduced due to thermal instability. Growing conditions have a minor effect whereas seasonal effects show a more pronounced impact. These findings could extend the knowledge about the allergen level of different tomato varieties and may help to improve food safety to potentially increase the life quality of patients suffering from birch pollen allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2808062199,"Recognition of Pathogen-associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) by Toll-like receptors is central to innate immunity. Many bacterial PAMPs such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid have amphiphilic properties. The hydrophobicity of amphiphilic PAMPs contributes to increasing entropy and causes these molecules to self-aggregate or bind host carrier proteins in aqueous physiological environments. The goal of this work was to determine how innate immune signaling is impacted by physical presentation and association of amphiphilic PAMPs with serum carrier proteins, using LPS as an example molecule. Specifically, we measured LPS-induced cytokine profiles in murine macrophages when the antigen was presented associated with the various serum carrier proteins in serum versus a serum-depleted system. Our study demonstrates that the observed cytokine profiles are dramatically different when LPS is presented in buffer, versus in serum when it is associated with proteins, specifically with respect to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the latter. These studies suggest that LPS-mediated cytokine expression is dependent on its presentation in physiological systems. The amphiphilicity of bacterial PAMPs and consequent association with lipoproteins is a feature, which should be taken into account in the design of in vitro experiments. Further studies of the interdependencies of different serum carriers can identify pathways for drug delivery and diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2808635102,"Various natural and manmade disasters during last decades have highlighted the need of further improving on governmental preparedness to emergency events, and a relief supplies distribution problem named Inventory Slack Routing Problem (ISRP) has received increasing attentions. In an ISRP, inventory slack is defined as the duration between reliefs arriving time and estimated inventory stock-out time. Hence, a larger inventory slack could grant more responsive time in facing of various factors (e.g., traffic congestion) that may lead to delivery lateness. In this study, the relief distribution problem is formulated as an optimization model that maximize the minimum slack among all dispensing sites. To efficiently solve this problem, we propose a two-stage approach to tackle the vehicle routing and relief allocation sub-problems. By analyzing the inter-relations between these two sub-problems, a new objective function considering both delivery durations and dispensing rates of demand sites is applied in the first stage to design the vehicle routes. A hierarchical routing approach and a sweep approach are also proposed in this stage. Given the vehicle routing plan, the relief allocation could be easily solved in the second stage. Numerical experiment with a comparison of multi-vehicle Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has demonstrated the need of ISRP and the capability of the proposed solution approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2808703364,"Distinct chromatin organization features, such as centromeres and heterochromatin domains, are inherited epigenetically. However, the mechanisms that modulate the accuracy of epigenetic inheritance, especially at the individual nucleosome level, are not well-understood. Here, using ChIP and next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), we characterized Ccp1, a homolog of the histone chaperone Vps75 in budding yeast that functions in centromere chromatin duplication and heterochromatin maintenance in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). We show that Ccp1 is enriched at the central core regions of the centromeres. Of note, among all histone chaperones characterized, deletion of the ccp1 gene uniquely reduced the rate of epigenetic switching, manifested as position effect variegation within the centromeric core region (CEN-PEV). In contrast, gene deletion of other histone chaperones either elevated the PEV switching rates or did not affect centromeric PEV. Ccp1 and the kinetochore components Mis6 and Sim4 were mutually dependent for centromere or kinetochore association at the proper levels. Moreover, Ccp1 influenced heterochromatin distribution at multiple loci in the genome, including the subtelomeric and the pericentromeric regions. We also found that Gar2, a protein predominantly enriched in the nucleolus, functions similarly to Ccp1 in modulating the epigenetic stability of centromeric regions, although its mechanism remained unclear.

Together, our results identify Ccp1 as an important player in modulating epigenetic stability and maintaining proper organization of multiple chromatin domains throughout the fission yeast genome. Nucleosomes, the basic structural units of chromatin, are each composed of two copies of histone H3, H4, H2A, and H2B, respectively, with a 147-bp DNA fragment wrapping around (1.Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J.

Distinct nucleosomal organization patterns along the chromatin profoundly affect the functional output of the genome and must be preserved during cell proliferation to maintain specific transcription program and, thereby, the distinct cell identity. The chromatin is duplicated along with DNA replication via a process called replication-coupled nucleosome assembly (2.De Koning L. Corpet A. Haber J.E. Almouzni G.

To duplicate the chromatin structure accurately, it is essential that the recycled old histones (which may carry the epigenetic information) should be reincorporated into their original sites on one of the duplicated DNA strands. Furthermore, on the other daughter DNA strand, the same nucleosome organization pattern needs to be established de novo, using newly synthesized histones (4.Ransom M. Dennehey B.K. Tyler J.K.

In the past decades, much has been learned about the biological processes that influence genetic stability, including DNA replication precision, DNA damage and repair, and cell death with severe DNA damage. In comparison, little is known about how epigenetic stability is achieved, which must be influenced by the precision of chromatin duplication and almost certainly other processes that implicate chromatin, such as transcription and DNA damage repair. Not all chromosomal features are necessarily inherited epigenetically, with some better demonstrated than others. One well-established example is the centromere, a site of the chromosome on which the kinetochore assembles. The kinetochore is a large multiprotein apparatus that links the chromosome to the spindle microtubules and provides the physical force driving chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis (7.Hayashi A. Asakawa H. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Reconstruction of the kinetochore during meiosis in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Mol. Biol.

Most eukaryotic organisms, including the fission yeast, have a large and complex centromere on each chromosome, containing dozens to hundreds of CENP-A nucleosomes.

At the junctions of the pericentromeric and the central core regions of the centromere, the boundaries between the two domains are well-defined by the underlying tRNA genes (23.Scott K.C.

We are interested in exploring what may influence the accuracy of chromatin duplication, using fission yeast as the experimental system. Any inheritable changes occurred during the history of colony formation may be preserved and reflected in the heterogeneity and complexity of the cell population within the colony and can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively (24.Liu T.Y. Dodson A.E. Terhorst J. Song Y.S. Rine J. Riches of phenotype computationally extracted from microbial colonies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We notice that epigenetic inheritance of a specific chromatin feature may be readily manifested by a phenomenon called position effect variegation (PEV), 2The abbreviations used are: PEVposition effect variegationCENcentromeric core regionH3K9me2histone H3 Lys-9 dimethylationSPBspindle pole bodyTBZthiabendazoleDICdifferential interference contrast. in which the transcription state of a gene, due to its specific locus within the genome, varies between a repressed mode and an expressed mode. PEV was first reported in the 1930s in specific Drosophila mutant strains where the white gene expression status was variable upon translocation to a site nearby heterochromatin (25.Muller H.J. Types of visible variations induced by X-rays in Drosophila.J. Genet. 1929; 22: 299-334Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar), reflecting the dynamic changes of heterochromatin spreading onto or shrinking from the white gene. PEV was later observed broadly in other organisms and is associated with various underlying chromatin features. In fission yeast, PEV was observed with a reporter gene (e.g. ade6 or ura4) inserted within the centromeric core region (referred to as CEN-PEV in this work) (26.Allshire R.C. Javerzat J.-P. Redhead N.J. Cranston G. Position effect variegation at fission yeast centromeres.Cell. 1994; 76 (8287474): 157-16910.1016/0092-8674(94)90180-5Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies, including those from our laboratory, have demonstrated that in CEN-PEV, Cnp1 (CENP-A homolog in fission yeast) nucleosome occupancy on the reporter gene correlates with its transcriptional silencing (15.Yao J.

Using an experimental procedure, the pedigree analysis, to track the ON and OFF states of the CEN::ade6 reporter through mitotic cell generations at the individual cell level, we have shown that the transcription states of CEN::ade6 are inheritable through cell generations. Switches between the two states are also detected at constant rates (15.Yao J. Liu X. Sakuno T. Li W. Xi Y. Aravamudhan P. Joglekar A. Li W. Watanabe Y. He X.

CEN-PEV vividly reflects the epigenetic inheritance and the dynamic switching of centromeric chromatin states. Given the correlation between Cnp1 occupancy and the silencing of the reporter genes, these interchangeable chromatin states likely correlate with changes in Cnp1 nucleosome positioning within the centromeric core. PEV also occurs elsewhere in the fission yeast genome, such as the subtelomeric region or next to a heterochromatin-initiating DNA element (cenH). There, instead of Cnp1 occupancy, gene silencing is due to heterochromatin (H3K9me2) spreading onto or shrinking from the reporter (29.Allshire R.C. Ekwall K. Epigenetic regulation of chromatin states in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7 (26134317): a01877010.1101/cshperspect.a018770Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In sum, despite the different biochemical nature of the associated chromatin features, PEV may serve as a convenient indicator of epigenetic inheritance stability of local chromatin structures through mitotic cell generations. Here we describe characterizing new roles of Ccp1 in fission yeast, as an important modulator for the epigenetic stability of PEVs associated with Cnp1 or heterochromatin modification (H3K9me2), centromere function, and proper heterochromatin distributions elsewhere in the epigenome. Also, we have found that Gar2, a nucleolar protein, functionally cooperates with Ccp1 in maintaining proper heterochromatin distribution at pericentromeric regions as well as in modulating centromeric epigenetic stability. To elucidate the mechanism that modulates the nucleosomal epigenetic stability in fission yeast, we performed a genetic survey in an annotated gene deletion library (30.Kim D.U. Hayles J. Kim D.

An established CEN-PEV system was used as the readout for the genetic screen in which a reporter gene, ade6, was inserted at the central core of CEN2. Previous studies indicated that the occupancy of Cnp1 on ade6 correlates with transcriptional silencing (15.Yao J. Liu X. Sakuno T. Li W. Xi Y. Aravamudhan P. Joglekar A. Li W. Watanabe Y. He X.

We reason that, using centromeric PEV of ade6 inserted in cnt2 (designated as cnt2::ade6 thereafter in this work) as the readout, switching between the ON and OFF states of ade6 reflects the changes of Cnp1 occupancy on the ade6 reporter gene through mitotic cell generations. The frequencies of such switches are visually illustrated by the intensities of color-sectoring strips of individual colonies, as the red and white colors are correspondent to ade6 OFF and ON, respectively, in medium with low adenine supply. In an ongoing screening of the Bioneer V.1 pombe deletion library, we have identified specific genes whose deletion led to quantitative changes in cnt2::ade6 expression pattern switching within single colonies. In selected isolates, we quantified the changes in switching frequencies by an established pedigree analysis assay (15.Yao J. Liu X. Sakuno T. Li W. Xi Y. Aravamudhan P. Joglekar A. Li W. Watanabe Y. He X. Plasticity and epigenetic inheritance of centromere-specific histone H3 (CENP-A)-containing nucleosome positioning in the fission yeast.J. Biol.

In this study, we focus on one gene, SPBC36B7.08c (systematic ID), named as ccp1, which encodes a protein homologous to a histone chaperone, Vps75, in the budding yeast. Single colonies of ccp1Δ originated from ade6 silencing cells are predominantly red and consistently contain fewer white sectors than those of WT, demonstrating that Cnp1 occupancy on ade6 switches less frequently in the mutant (Fig. 1A). To test whether Ccp1 also affects the epigenetic stability elsewhere on chromatin mediated by canonical H3 nucleosomes, we assessed the variability of PEV associated with heterochromatin. Specifically, a DNA segment, cenH (centromere-homologous repeat) element within the mating-type region, is sufficient to initiate the formation of heterochromatin at ectopic sites via an RNAi-dependent pathway (32.Hall I.M. Shankaranarayana G.D. Noma K. Ayoub N. Cohen A. Grewal S.I.S.

By inserting cenH at the ura4 locus and placing ade6 next to cenH (designated as cenH::ade6 in this work thereafter), a typical PEV phenomenon is observed (Fig. 1B). Compared with WT, ccp1Δ colonies showed the reduced variability of cenH::ade6 PEV, based on colony morphology of color sectoring density (Fig. 1B). Quantification by pedigree analysis confirmed that the switching rates of both cnt2::ade6 (also see Fig. 7B in Ref. 15.Yao J. Liu X. Sakuno T. Li W. Xi Y. Aravamudhan P. Joglekar A. Li W. Watanabe Y.

Ccp1 shows a high structural similarity to Vps75, suggesting that it may function as an authentic histone chaperone (33.Dong Q. Yin F.X. Gao F. Shen Y. Zhang F. Li Y. He H. Gonzalez M. Yang J.

In budding yeast, Vps75 was shown to form a complex with Rtt109 and to promote Rtt109's acetyltransferase activity on Lys-56 of histone H3 (34.Han J. Zhou H. Li Z. Xu R.M. Zhang Z.

To test whether the role that Ccp1 (Vps75 homolog) plays in nucleosomal epigenetic stability is linked with Rtt109, we examined the PEV phenotype of the rtt109Δ strain and found that rtt109Δ does not affect the variability of cnt2::ade6 (consistent with our previous result (Fig. 7B in Ref. 15.Yao J.

Hence, our data indicate that Ccp1 modulates the nucleosomal epigenetic stability in an Rtt109-independent manner. Vps75 belongs to the NAP (nucleosome assembly protein) family and functions as a histone chaperone that binds with histone H3-H4 tetramer (37.Tang Y. Meeth K. Jiang E. Luo C. Marmorstein R. Structure of Vps75 and implications for histone chaperone function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This prompted us to investigate whether other histone chaperones or chromatin remodeling factors play a role in modulating cnt2::ade6 PEV and cenH::ade6 PEV variability. To this end, we constructed deletion strains for a list of candidate genes, combining the deletions with the cnt2::ade6 or cenH::ade6 reporters by genetic crossing. PEV phenotypes were examined by visual inspection of the colony color-sectoring morphology. The results (summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S1B) suggest that whereas most candidate gene deletions either do not affect the epigenetic stability of the reporters at all or enhance the epigenetic switching in only cnt2::ade6, ccp1Δ uniquely causes reduction in nucleosomal epigenetic switching that is mediated by both Cnp1 (cnt2::ade6) and H3K9me2 (cenH::ade6 marker inserted in ura4 locus).Table 1A summary of the epigenetic stability characterization of selected chromatin modulator mutants using the cnt2::ade6 and cenH::ade6 PEV systems Open table in a new tab Vps75 has a classical nuclear localization signal and is located in the nucleus in budding yeast (39.Keck K.M.

To examine the intracellular localization of Ccp1 in S. pombe, we fused a GFP tag to the C terminus of ccp1 at its endogenous locus. We observed that Ccp1-GFP expressed under its native promoter is distributed throughout the nucleus at all cell cycle stages. In addition, during interphase (G1 to G2 phase) but not in mitosis, Ccp1-GFP forms a distinct bright dot at the edge of the nucleus (Fig. 2A), a similar cellular localization pattern was also observed by Dong et al. (33.Dong Q. Yin F.X. Gao F. Shen Y. Zhang F. Li Y. He H. Gonzalez M. Yang J. Zhang S. Su M. Chen Y.-H. Li F. Ccp1 homodimer mediates chromatin integrity by antagonizing CENP-A loading.Mol.

In fission yeast cells, all three centromeres cluster adjacent to the spindle pole body (SPB) at the nuclear periphery in interphase. To test whether the specific dot of Ccp1-GFP represents its enrichment at the centromeres/kinetochores, we assessed possible co-localization of the Ccp1-GFP dot with the SPB and the centromere/kinetochore cluster. In strains carrying Ccp1-GFP and Sad1-mCherry (an SPB protein) or Ccp1-DsRed1 and Spc7-GFP (a kinetochore component), with all tagged genes under their respective native promoters (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1C), we found that the Ccp1-GFP dot overlaps with the SPB or the kinetochore dot, suggesting that Ccp1 in interphase is enriched at the centromeres/kinetochores. The centromeres of fission yeast consist of a central core region (cnt and part of imr) and the flanking repetitive (otr and part of imr) sequence. Cnp1-containing nucleosomes are exclusively localized to the central core regions, and the flanking repetitive sequence is covered by constitutive heterochromatin. To determine the association sites of Ccp1 with the centromeres and to characterize the global distribution pattern of Ccp1 throughout the genome, ChIP plus next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) were performed for Myc-tagged Ccp1 (C-terminal fusion protein). The result revealed that Ccp1 exclusively associates with the central core region of each centromere, which corroborates and expands the subcellular fluorescent observation results (Fig. 2C) (33.Dong Q.

Genetic and functional studies suggest that Fpy1p may play a key role in flavin metabolism and is the first-reported non-Nudix superfamily enzyme to display FAD pyrophosphatase activity. Characterization of mutant yeast strains found that deletion of fpy1 counteracts the adverse effects that are caused by deletion of flx1, a known mitochondrial FAD transporter. We show that Fpy1p is capable of hydrolyzing FAD, NAD(H), and ADP-ribose. The enzymatic activity of Fpy1p is dependent upon the presence of K+ and divalent metal cations, with similar kinetic parameters to those that have been reported for Nudix FAD pyrophosphatases. In addition, we report that the deletion of fpy1 intensifies the FMN-dependence of null mutants of the riboflavin kinase Fmn1p, demonstrate that fpy1 mutation abolishes the decreased fitness resulting from the deletion of the flx1 ORF, and offer a possible mechanism for the genetic interplay between fpy1, flx1 and fmn1."

https://openalex.org/W2807741448,"This study investigates quality prediction methods for synthesized speech using EEG. Training a predictive model using EEG is challenging due to a small number of training trials, a low signal-to-noise ratio, and a high correlation among independent variables. When a predictive model is trained with a machine learning algorithm, the features extracted from multi-channel EEG signals are usually organized as a vector and their structures are ignored even though they are highly structured signals. This study predicts the subjective rating scores of synthesized speeches, including their overall impression, valence, and arousal, by creating tensor structured features instead of vectorized ones to exploit the structure of the features. We extracted various features to construct a tensor feature that maintained their structure. Vectorized and tensorial features were used to predict the rating scales, and the experimental result showed that prediction with tensorial features achieved the better predictive performance. Among the features, the alpha and beta bands are particularly more effective for predictions than other features, which agrees with previous neurophysiological studies."

Associations of spine shape modes with: 1) contemporaneous measures of total and central adiposity (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC)) and body composition (android:gynoid fat mass ratio and lean and fat mass indices, calculated as whole body (excluding the head) lean or fat mass (kg) divided by height2 (m)2); 2) changes in total and central adiposity between age 36 and 60–64 and 3) age at onset of overweight, were tested using linear regression models. Four modes described 79% of the total variance in spine shape. In men, greater lean mass index was associated with a larger lordosis whereas greater fat mass index was associated with straighter spines. Greater current BMI was associated with a more uneven curvature in men and with larger anterior-posterior (a-p) vertebral diameters in both sexes. Greater WC and fat mass index were also associated with a-p diameter in both sexes. There was no clear evidence that gains in BMI and WC during earlier stages of adulthood were associated with spine shape but younger onset of overweight was associated with a more uneven spine and greater a-p diameter. In conclusion, sagittal spine shapes had different associations with total and central adiposity; earlier onset of overweight and prior measures of WC were particularly important."

https://openalex.org/W2808543024,"Direction-dependent interaction rules are incorporated into a one-dimensional discrete-time stochastic individual-based model (IBM) of collective behavior to compare pattern formation with an existing partial differential equation (PDE) model. The IBM is formulated in terms of three social interaction forces: repulsion, alignment, and attraction, and includes information regarding conspecifics' direction of travel. The IBM produces a variety of spatial patterns which qualitatively match patterns observed in a PDE model. The addition of direction-dependent interaction rules exemplifies how directional information transfer within a group of individuals can result in enriched pattern formation. Our individual-based modelling framework reveals the influence that direction-dependent interaction rules such as biological communication can have upon individual movement trajectories and how these trajectories combine to form group patterns."

The question about the best solution to the ball catching problem has been subject to intense scientific debate for almost 50 years. It turns out that this scientific debate is not focused on the ball catching problem alone, but revolves around the research question what constitutes the ingredients of intelligent decision making. Over time, two opposing views have emerged: the generalist view regarding intelligence as the ability to solve any task without knowing goal and environment in advance, based on optimal decision making using predictive models; and the specialist view which argues that intelligent decision making does not have to be based on predictive models and not even optimal, advocating simple and efficient rules of thumb (heuristics) as superior to enable accurate decisions. We study two types of approaches to the ball catching problem, one for each view, and investigate their properties using both a theoretical analysis and a broad set of simulation experiments. Our study shows that neither of the two types of approaches can be regarded as superior in solving all relevant variants of the ball catching problem: each approach is optimal under a different realistic environmental condition. Therefore, predictive models neither guarantee nor prevent success a priori, and we further show that the key difference between the generalist and the specialist approach to ball catching is the type of input representation used to control the agent. From this finding, we conclude that the right solution to a decision making or control problem is orthogonal to the generalist and specialist approach, and thus requires a reconciliation of the two views in favor of a representation-centric view."

A better understanding of the risk factors and social context is necessary to inform public health interventions and policies. This paper describes the validation of several measurement scales for use in Turkey, which relate to child and parent perceptions of physical activity (PA) and enablers and barriers of physical activity in the home environment.The aim of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of several measurement scales in Turkey using a population sample across three socio-economic strata in the Turkish capital, Ankara. Surveys were conducted in Grade 4 children (mean age = 9.7 years for boys; 9.9 years for girls), and their parents, across 6 randomly selected schools, stratified by SES (n = 641 students, 483 parents). Construct validity of the scales was evaluated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Internal consistency of scales and test-retest reliability were assessed by Cronbach's alpha and intra-class correlation.The scales as a whole were found to have acceptable-to-good model fit statistics (PA Barriers: RMSEA = 0.076, SRMR = 0.0577, AGFI = 0.901; PA Outcome Expectancies: RMSEA = 0.054, SRMR = 0.0545, AGFI = 0.916, and PA Home Environment: RMSEA = 0.038, SRMR = 0.0233, AGFI = 0.976). The PA Barriers subscales showed good internal consistency and poor to fair test-retest reliability (personal α = 0.79, ICC = 0.29, environmental α = 0.73, ICC = 0.59). The PA Outcome Expectancies subscales showed good internal consistency and test-retest reliability (negative α = 0.77, ICC = 0.56; positive α = 0.74, ICC = 0.49). Only the PA Home Environment subscale on support for PA was validated in the final confirmatory model; it showed moderate internal consistency and test-retest reliability (α = 0.61, ICC = 0.48).This study is the first to validate measures of perceptions of physical activity and the physical activity home environment in Turkey. Our results support the originally hypothesized two-factor structures for Physical Activity Barriers and Physical Activity Outcome Expectancies. However, we found the one-factor rather than two-factor structure for Physical Activity Home Environment had the best model fit. This study provides general support for the use of these scales in Turkey in terms of validity, but test-retest reliability warrants further research."
