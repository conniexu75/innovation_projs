https://openalex.org/W2026970642,"Antibody-secreting hybrid cells have been derived from a fusion between mouse myeloma cells and spleen cells from a mouse immunized with membrane from human tonsil lymphocyte preparations. Hybrids secreting antibodies to cell surface antigens were detected by assaying culture supernatants for antibody binding to human tonsil cells. Six different antibodies (called W6/1, /28, /32, /34, /45 and /46 were analyzed. These were either against antigens of wide tissue distribution (W6/32, /34, and /46) or mainly on erythrocytes (W6/1 and W6/28). One of the anti-erythrocyte antibodies (W6/1) detected a polymorphic antigen, since blood group A1 and A2 erythrocytes were labeled while B and O were not. Antibodies W6/34, /45 and /46 were all against antigens which were mapped to the short arm of chromosome 11 by segregation analysis of mouse-human hybrids. Immunoprecipitation studies suggest that W6/45 antigen may be a protein of 16,000 dalton, apparent molecular weight, while W6/34 and /46 antigens could not be detected by this technique. Antibody W6/32 is against a determinant common to most, if not all, of the 43,000 dalton molecular weight chains of HLA-A, B and C antigens. This was established by somatic cell genetic techniques and by immunoprecipitation analysis. Tonsil leucocytes bound 370,000 W6/32 antibody molecules per cell at saturation. The hybrid myelomas W6/32 and W6/34 have been cloned, and both secrete an IgG2 antibody. W6/32 cells were grown in mice, and the serum of the tumor-bearing animals contained greater than 10 mg/ml of monoclonal antibody. The experiments established the usefulness of the bybrid myeloma technique in preparing monospecific antibodies against human cell surface antigens. In particular, this study highlights the possibilities not only of obtaining reagents for somatic cell genetics, but also of obtaining mouse antibodies detecting human antigenic polymorphisms."
https://openalex.org/W1963507142,"The hyperacetylation of histones due to treatment of cultured cells with sodium butyrate has been studied. The hyperacetylation is due to inhibition of histone deacetylase. Other short chain fatty acids including acetic, isobutyric and propionic acid also produce increased modification. Histone H4 already deposited on the chromosome can be rapidly acetylated to the extent of about 70%. That 80% of histone H4 is acetylated after a 24 hr exposure to butyrate is due to the fact that incoming H4 histone is 100% acetylated and does not return to the parental unmodified form in the presence of butyrate."
https://openalex.org/W2078406520,"A group of oxygenated sterols has been identified as potent and specific inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis. The ability of these compounds to inhibit sterol synthesis in cultured cells and the ineffectiveness of cholesterol under the same conditions suggest that feedback regulation of sterol biosynthesis may be brought about by an oxygenated sterol rather than by cholesterol. The nature of the regulatory sterol may vary in different cells with their specific requirements for cholesterol as a structural component or as a precursor of other steroid products. The use of oxygenated sterols to block sterol synthesis in cultured cells provides new information regarding the role of sterol in cell membrane structure and function. For example, de novo sterol synthesis is required for DNA synthesis and cell division by some cultured cells. Studies with cultured cells, and with rats and mice in vivo, suggest that oxygenated sterols could be of value in the treatment of several important human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2117120766,"Taste substances applied to the oral cavity result in either ingestion or rejection, each with a characteristic muscular response pattern. These responses are the same in decerebrate and intact rats; the caudal brainstem appears to be the neural substrate of ingestion and rejection responses. The experiment determined whether decerebrates can alter these discriminative responses as a function of food deprivation or toxicosis. Food-deprived decerebrate rats, like intact ones, ingested a taste substance they had rejected when sated. However, these same decerebrates, in contrast to controls, neither rejected nor decreased ingestive reactions to a novel taste after that taste had been repeatedly paired with lithium chloride-induced illness. Although the forebrain may be important for integrating ingestion, some aspects of this control seem to be represented in caudal brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W2041044005,"Intercellular matrices secreted by chick embryo fibroblasts in culture were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Cell-cell contact is a prerequisite for the expression of such matrices. The smallest fiber detected by transmission electron microscopy is 5--10 nm in diameter. These matrix fibers tend to cluster to form bundles. Immunofluorescence and immunoferritin procedures reveal that LETS protein is one of the components of the matrices. The matrices are isolated from other cellular organelles by detergent treatment. More than 90% of the proteins in cell-free matrices are LETS protein, suggesting that the matrices are probably made of only one component--LETS protein. Since the solubilization of matrices requires beta-mercaptoethanol, LETS protein matrices may be the first known polymer system in nature to use disulfide linkage as an intermolecular polymerization vehicle. Collagen does not appear to be involved in such matrices. The LETS protein matrix supports the morphological conversion of rounded cells into spindle-shaped, and also promotes myoblast fusion. It does not, however, exert an effect upon cell growth, the rate of glucose uptake or protease production."
https://openalex.org/W2069891214,"Addition of LETS glycoprotein to normal or transformed cells produces increased migration of the cells, as determined by formation of phagokinetic tracks on gold particle-coated coverslips. These tracks arise by a combination of phagocytosis of the gold particles and cellular migration. Increased motility is also evident on plastic in the absence of gold particles. The added LETS protein attaches to the cells in a fibrillar network, and binding is greater to normal than to transformed cells. The effects of LETS protein on migration are consistent with its effects on cell adhesion, morphology and cytoskeleton, and have potential implications for the determination of cellular migration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2082763313,"Enkephalin-like activity has been measured in the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid of patients with intractable pain. Electrical stimulation of periventricular brain sites resulted in significant decrease in persistent pain in these subjects. This analgesia, which was blocked by naloxone in 80% of the cases, was accompanied by a significant rise in ventricular enkephalin-like activity, as measured by two different methods. The results present evidence of in vivo release of enkephalin-like material in humans and suggest that stimulation analgesia may be partially due to this release."
https://openalex.org/W2065723827,"The presence of polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids in leukocytic membranes prompted study of their possible role in the induction of brain edema. Polyunsaturated fatty acids including sodium arachidonate, sodium linoleate, sodium linolenate, and docosahexaenoic acids induced edema in slices of rat brain cortex. This cellular edema was specific, since neither saturated fatty acids nor a fatty acid containing a single double bond had such effect."
https://openalex.org/W2037918689,"The rabbit choroid plexus, responsible for the bulk production of cerebrospinal fluid, is well supplied by sympathetic nerves emanating in the superior cervical ganglia. Electrical stimulation of these nerves markedly reduces production of cerebrospinal fluid, measured by [14C] inulin dilution during ventricular perfusion, whereas sympathetic denervation enhances the rate of formation."
https://openalex.org/W2122692146,"During the adipose conversion of 3T3 cells in medium supplemented with 10% serum, the accumulation of triglyceride depends upon a small molecular weight component in the serum. When this is removed by exhaustive dialysis of the serum, the cells undergo some changes that are part of the adipose conversion, but very little triglyceride accumulates. After the addition of either a serum dialysate or commercial biotin, cellular lipid begins to accumulate rapidly. The dialyzable factor in the serum has numerous chemical properties of biotin. When cells begin the adipose conversion in the absence of biotin, they are unable to increase their rate of acetate incorporation into triglyceride, but they do undergo the same change in shape to spherical, the same increase in activity of cytoplasmic (NAD-linked) glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (300 fold) and the same increase in lipoprotein lipase (>50 fold) as in the presence of biotin. On the other hand, in the biotin-deficient state the activity of glycerophosphate acyltransferase and of malic enzyme rises to only a small fraction of the control level. After the addition of biotin to the biotin-deficient cultures, the activity of both enzymes increases to the control level within 24–48 hr. These results are consistent with the concept that the glycerophosphate dehydrogenase is a primary enzyme in the adipose conversion: its response (measured as the amount of extractable activity) does not depend upon the rate of cellular fatty acid synthesis. Lipoprotein lipase is similarly independent. On the other hand, both malic enzyme and glycerophosphate acyltransferase may be considered as secondary enzymes in the sense that their response during the adipose conversion is linked to the supply of fatty acid."
https://openalex.org/W2002811764,"The results of this investigation indicate an adhesive specificity between PMN and cultured endothelial cells. This was monitored by the mono-layer collection assay and by direct cell counts using the scanning electron microscope. Both techniques showed that significantly more PMN attached to endothelial cells than to a variety of other cell types. The interaction can be modulated by divalent cations and neuraminidase, implying a role for surface charge. In the presence of chemotactic agents, the number of PMN adhering to endothelial cells increases. This system presents a good model for studying the process of PMN margination which occurs in vivo during the acute inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2092013502,"The synthesis and properties of T25 glycoprotein which bears the serological specificity Thy-1 have been studied in mutants of cultured mouse lymphoma cells that do not express Thy-1 on their surface. Five complementation classes of mutant cells were previously characterized by somatic genetic analysis. Synthesis of abnormal T25 glycoproteins was detected in four classes of mutants. Each of these aberrant products was degraded move rapidly than T25 glycoprotein of wild-type cells. Defects in the oligosaccharide units of T25 glycoprotein were demonstrated in three classes of mutants. In one of these mutant classes, evidence for a general defect in glycosylation of cell surface glycoproteins was obtained. These data indicate that normal glycosylation of T25 glycoprotein is probably essential for the molecule to be incorporated into the plasma membrane and expressed on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2090438647,"A newly discovered class of neurons, ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) burst neurons, has PGO wave relationships of phase-leading, stereotyped discharge bursts, and the highest reported discharge specificity and coherence; these neurons thus fulfill correlative criteria for output generator neurons for PGO waves. The PGO burst neurons are recorded in a discrete dorsal brainstem area in apposition to the brachium conjunctivum."
https://openalex.org/W1977532037,"Multiple electrophoretic forms of histones 1, 2A and 2B, stage-specific with respect to the timing of their synthesis in embryogenesis, have previously been detected in embryos of Stongylocentrotus purpuratus. We now present evidence that most of these can be synthesized in vitro by using mRNAs extracted from sea urchin polysomes as templates for a heterologous cell-free translation system (wheat germ). The in vitro products were identified by electrophoresis in two fundamentally different gel systems; the effects of oxidation of methionyl residues on affinities of the proteins for Triton X-100; the relative extents of incorporation of different amino acids into the various proteins; and correspondence of in vitro products and in vivo histones with respect to developmental stage specificity. Since a single translation system synthesized different sets of proteins in response to polysomal mRNAs from different stages (blastula, mesenchyme blastula and gastrula), the proteins most probably differ from each other in primary structure rather than in post-translational modifications. We therefore refer to them as subtypes of their respective classes. Some of the previously described multiplicity of the histone genes is needed to code for such subtypes. The data also show that functional mRNAs encoding the late subtypes (β, γ and δ) are not detectable in the total RNA of the embryo until the stage at which late subtypes begin to be synthesized in vivo. This indicates that control mechanisms preceding translation are involved in the onset of synthesis of those subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2035179392,"Kinetoplast DNA from the mitochondria of Crithidia is in the form of a two-dimensional network of thousands of minicircles each containing about 2.5 kb, and a small number of maxicircles each containing about 40 kb. Fractionation of kinetoplast DNA by equilibrium centrifugation in a CsCl-propidium dilodide gradient resolves it into three types of networks. Form I networks band at high density and contain minicircles which are covalently closed; form II networks band at low density and contain minicircles which are nicked or gapped; and replicating networks band at intermediate density and contain some minicircles of each type. Form I networks contain about 5000 minicircles; form II networks contain about 11,000; and replicating networks contain an intermediate number. When cells are pulse-labeled with 3H-thymidine, radioactivity in mitochondrial DNA is preferentially incorporated into replicating networks, but after a chase it appears first in form II networks and finally in form I. Examination of replicating networks by electron microscopy in the presence of ethidium bromide reveals that minicircles in the central region of the network are twisted and therefore covalently closed, whereas those in the peripheral region are not twisted and therefore must be nicked or gapped. The pulse-label is incorporated into the nicked or gapped minicircles of the replicating networks. These results indicate that replication of form I networks begins in peripheral minicircles and that progeny minicircles remain nicked or gapped. As replication proceeds, the size of the network increases, and the peripheral zone of nicked or gapped minicircles enlarges. Finally, when all minicircles have replicated, the network, now form II, is double the size of form I and contains only nicked or gapped minicircles. The final step in replication presumably includes both the cleavage of the network into two form I species and the covalent closure of all the minicircles."
https://openalex.org/W2095652459,"The first measurements are reported of the sequence complexity of nuclear and polysomal RNA contained within the cells of a higher plant. Polysomal RNA from tobacco leaves was prepared by a procedure which minimized contamination with nuclear RNA. Hybridization of 3H-cDNA complementary to polysomal poly(A) RNA with an excess of tobacco DNA indicated that greater than 95% of the poly(A) mRNA was transcribed from single-copy sequences. RNA excess hybridization reactions with polysomal poly(A) RNA and 3H-cDNA revealed the presence of three abundance classes in the poly(A) mRNA. The best least-squares solution indicated that these classes comprise 9, 52, and 39% of the poly (A) mRNA and contain sequences present an average of 4500, 340 and 17 times per cell. Hybridization reactions containing an excess of nuclear or total polysomal RNA and 3H-single-copy DNA indicated the complexity of these RNA populations to be 1.19 X 10(8) nucleotides (nuclear) and 3.33 X 10(7) nucleotides (polysomal). Thus only 28% of the nuclear RNA sequence diversity (27,000 average-sized mRNA sequences) is respresented in leaf polysomes. These results suggest that there is a general similarity in the basic transcriptional processes of metaphytan and metazoan cells."

Moreover, contrast sensitivity and resolving power are lower for stimulation through the originally defocused eye, mimicking psychophysical results from human anisometropic amblyopes."
https://openalex.org/W1973436472,"RNA has been isolated from highly purified kinetoplast-mitochondrial fractions of Leishmania tarentolae, and shown to consist of two major species that sediment at 9S and 12S in sucrose and also several additional low molecular weight species which were visualized by gel electrophoresis. The in vivo transcription of 9S and 12S RNAs was inhibited by ethidium bromide and rifampin, and was fairly insensitive to low actinomycin D and camptothecin. The 9S and 12S RNAs were isolated by acrylamide gel electrophoresis or by sedimentation in sucrose. Both RNAs contained approximately 80% A + U and did not contain long stretches of poly(A). The 9S and 12S RNAs were found to hybridize selectively to the maxicircle sequences of the kinetoplast DNA, implying that the maxicircle, and not the minicircle, represents the informational mitochondrial DNA in the kinetoplast."
https://openalex.org/W2012096611,"Histone gene repeats in S. purpuratus are shown to be of variable length and sequence. Two recombinant plasmids containing the full-length 6.3 kb histone repeat unit are found to differer in length at two sites in the repeating structure and in the occurrence of two restriction enzyme recognition sites. Variation in repeat length is also demonstrated in the unfractionated DNA of five sea urchins and in a sample of DNA enriched for histone gene sequences by density gradient methods. The repeats in each individual are of a very limited number of major classes, which may differ from one another in overall length or in distribution and presence of particular restriction enzyme sites. Variations are found to occur at many regions of the repeat; some have been mapped specifically to spacer regions. Repeats may differ dramatically from individual to individual since there is no one type of repeat class common to all, although the absolute length differences of the repeats that are found are small."
https://openalex.org/W2057150297,"We have used chromatin sensitivity to cleavage by micrococcal nuclease as a probe for differences between chromatin containing nascent DNA and that containing bulk DNA. Micrococcal nuclease digested the nascent DNA in chromatin of swimming blastulae of sea urchins more rapidly to acid-soluble nucleotides than the DNA of bulk chromatin. A part of the nascent DNA occurred in micrococcal nuclease-resistant structures which were either different from, or temporary modifications of, the bulk nucleosomes. This was inferred from the size differences between bulk and nascent DNA fragments in 10% polyacrylamide gels after micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei from a mixture of 14C-thymidine long- and 3H-thymidine pulse-labeled embryos. Bulk monomer and dimer DNA fragments contained about 170 and 410 base pairs (bp), respectively, when 18% of the bulk DNA had been rendered acid-soluble. At this level of digestion, “nascent monomer DNA” fragments of about 150 bp as well as 305 bp “large nascent DNA fragments” were observed. Increasing levels of digestion indicated that the large nascent DNA fragment was derived from a chromatin structure which was more resistant to micrococcal nuclease cleavage than bulk dimer chromatin subunits. Peaks of 3H-thymidine-labeled DNA fragments from embryos which had been pulse-labeled and then chased or labeled for several minutes overlapped those of 14C-thymidine long-labeled monomer, dimer and trimer fragments. This indicated that the chromatin organization at or near the replication fork which had temporarily changed during replication had returned to the organization of its nonreplicating state."

The beveling is gradual and continuous, highly reliable, and can be accomplished with common laboratory apparatus. The beveled electrodes are comparable in performance to those prepared with expensive commercial bevelers."
https://openalex.org/W2014257871,"Nine transcripts complementary to mouse L cell mitochondrial DNA have been detected, sized and mapped to restriction fragments using the method of Berk and Sharp (1977). RNA isolated from L cell mitochondria was hybridized to 32P-labeled, cloned L cell mitochondrial DNA restriction fragments in 70% formamide under conditions 5 degrees C above the melting temperature of the DNA-DNA duplex, but approximately 15 degrees C below the melting temperature of the RNA-DNA duplex. The heteroduplexed material was then treated with the single-strand-specific nuclease S1, whick cleaves the single-stranded DNA not protected by RNA-DNA duplex formation into oligonucleotides and leaves intact 32P-labeled, single-stranded DNA replicas complementary to the transcripts. The single-stranded DNA replicas were then resolved and sized by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis. Hybridization to strand-separated, 32P-labeled L cell mitochondria DNA restriction fragments under the same conditions showed that all nine transcripts hybridized exclusively to the heavy strand (H strand) of restriction fragments isolated as the dense strand from alkaline CsCl gradients, indicating that all stable transcripts 300 bases or longer detected by this technique originate from genes on the H strand. The two most abundant transcripts homologous to mitochondrial DNA map adjacent to the origin of replication. This result is consistent with map positions assigned to the large and small mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs isolated from Xenopus laevis and HeLa cells. Six of the other seven transcripts map continuously in approximately 40% of the genome. Only one transcript of 950 bases maps in the first quadrant of the genome as defined by the origin and direction of mitochondrial DNA replication, and it does not lie within the D loop region. The genetic function of the remaining 75% of this region of the genome is yet to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2127398699,"When Drosophila salivary glands are disrupted in cytoplasm from heat-shocked Drosophila Kc cells in culture, puffs are induced in the polytene nuclei at the heat shock loci. The in vitro response increases with time of incubation, reaching in vivo levels after 2 hr, and is sensitive to alpha-amanitin. Cytoplasm from control Kc cells induces poorly, but prolonged exposure to air or the addition of hydrogen peroxide stimulates induction to the levels observed with cytoplasm from heat-shocked Kc cells. Autoradiography confirms that the heat shock loci induced to puff in vitro are the most actively transcribing sites in the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2009006613,"Globin mRNA isolated from a number of beta0 thalassemia patients of different ethnic origins was analyzed by RNA-cDNA hybridization and, in two cases, by fingerprint analysis of 125I-labeled mRNA. Quantitation of the relative amounts of alpha- and beta-mRNA by hybridization to purified alpha-and beta-cDNA revealed that in approximately half the cases, there was less than 1% as much beta-mRNA as alpha-mRNA. In the rest of the cases, low levels of beta-like mRNA were detected in amounts 4-12% as abundant as alpha-mRNA. There was variability in the yield of beta-like mRNA in patients of the same racial group, in the same patient at different times and in similarly affected siblings: beta-mRNA was virtually absent in some samples, whereas low but significant levels were found in other samples. In one patient, beta-like mRNA was not detected in peripheral blood RNA, but was present in the RNA of bone marrow cells. In one case, the thermal stability of the beta0 thalassemia mRNA-beta-cDNA hybrid was measured and found to be slightly lower than that of the authentic beta-mRNA-beta-cDNA hybrid. In none of the cases tested was there synthesis of beta-globin chains directed by beta0 thalassemia mRNA in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system, even when beta-like mRNA was detected in the sample by hybridization assays. mRNA from two patients was labeled in vitro with 125I, digested with T1 RNAase and fractionated in two dimensions. Analysis of the resulting fingerprints revealed the presence of prominent alpha chain-specific oligonucleotides without detectable beta chain-specific oligonucleotides, and thereby confirmed the results of hybridization assays showing absent or very low levels of beta-mRNA in the same RNA samples. Our results support the concept that beta0 thalassemia is heterogeneous in its molecular basis even within the same racial group: in some patients, it is associated with absent beta globin mRNA, whereas in other patients, it is associated with low but significant levels of nonfunctional beta or beta-like globin mRNA. The variable amounts of beta-like mRNA detected in different samples from the same patient, and in patients with the same genotype, indicate that as yet undefined factors can influence the yield of beta-like mRNA observed in beta0 thalassemia."
https://openalex.org/W1974703005,"The synthesis of polypeptides with the properties of alpha and beta tropomyosin was investigated in differentiating cultures of a myogenic cell line and in a wheat germ cell-free system directed by purified RNA extracted at different stages of differentiation. The polypeptides co-migrate with tropomyosin in isoelectric focusing and SDS two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and SDS-urea/SDS two-dimensional gels. Like authentic tropomyosin, these polypeptides change their mobility greatly in the presence of urea and do not become labeled with proline. The beta tropomyosin synthesized in the intact cells and in the cell-free system can be separated by isoelectric focusing into at least two components. One component (designated beta1) is present in a small amount at all developmental stages examined, and a more basic component (beta2) is specific for differentiated cultures. The synthesis of beta2 in the intact cells and the capacity of purified RNA to direct its synthesis in a cell-free system become detectable and increase greatly during the period of fusion of the mononucleated cells into multinucleated fibers. The results suggest that the beta1 and beta2 tropomyosins are coded for by different genes."
https://openalex.org/W2104755398,"Two distinct populations of histone gene transcripts have been identified in the sea urchin embryo. Both late cleavage and mesenchyme blastula stages contain histone transcripts which hybridize to a full-length histone repeat recombinant DNA, pCO1. The histone RNAs of the two stages, however, are dissimilar in sequence. While the transcripts of the cleavage embryo form well matched hybrids with the plasmid DNA which are relatively resistant to RNAase, the hybrids containing the mesenchyme blastula transcripts melt some 10 degrees C lower and are twice as sensitive to RNAase. Hybridization of the two RNA samples to the Hha I fragments of the histone DNA, or to segments of the histone repeat subcloned in other plasmids, shows that many regions scattered along the repeat are complementary to widely diverged transcripts in the mesenchyme blastula RNA. The two RNA populations consist predominantly of polysomal RNA sequences and are most probably mRNAs for the five histones. The mesenchyme blastula RNA sequences in both S. purpuratus and L. pictus form hybrids with pCO1 DNA that are less stable than those containing L. pictus cleavage RNA, indicating the wide divergence of the two histone RNA populations. The bulk of the histone genes in S. purpuratus appear to be of the type coding for the early mRNAs. Only a small percentage of the several hundred gene copies are candidates for the type coding for the late mRNAs. The melting characteristics of the hybrids and the sensitivity of RNAase provide an assay for the late embryonic histone genes. Of the total RNA labeled during a 10 min pulse in the cleavage embryo, histone transcripts represent approximately 9.7 and 6.5% of the radioactivity in S. purpuratus and L. pictus, respectively. These values fall to 0.57 and 1.4%, respectively, at the mesenchyme blastula stage. Although histone genes are transcribed during these two periods, the type of gene which is active is switched at some point prior to the mesenchyme blastula stage."
https://openalex.org/W1500588567,"Several lines of evidence indicate that ligandin consists of two different subunits. The protein dissociates into two components that are detected by electrophoresis in a discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate system, or in acid-urea gels, and by isoelectric focusing in the presence of urea. The apparent molecular weights of the two polypeptides are 25,000 and 22,000. Alkylated or succinylated ligandins also exhibit subunit heterogeneity and resolved into two bands in these electrophoretic systems. Cross-linked ligandin showed only one band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis indicating that the two subunits are part of a heterodimeric protein rather than monomers of two different proteins. No dansylated terminal amino acids were detected suggesting that the NH2-terminal residues of both chains are blocked. One mole of arginine or phenylalanine was released per mole of ligandin after digestion with carboxypeptidase B or A, respectively. Tryptic maps of succinylated ligandin were consistent with identical disposition of arginine residues in both chains, but several additional tryptic peptides were obtained with native ligandin as compared to the predicted number if both subunits were identical. These observations are consistent with the possibility that both subunits contain common sequences and that a small peptide of about 25 to 30 amino acid residues is cleaved from the COOH-terminal of the larger subunit to produce the smaller subunit."

https://openalex.org/W2082208974,"The contour lengths of φX174 DNA duplex and RNA-DNA hybrid molecules were measured by several commonly used electron microscopic techniques. The countour length of the hybrid molecules corresponds to a rise of 2.5 to 2.6 angstroms per base pair, as expected for the A conformation, while the length of φX174 duplex DNA similarly measured corresponds to a 2.9-angstrom rise, very different from 3.4 angstroms of the classic B form. Thus any chromatin structure parameter based on electron microscopy and a rise of 3.4 angstroms must be reappraised. The possibility that DNA in dilute solution also has a rise of 2.9 angstroms and a screw of 10.5 base pairs per turn is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2045786053,The dramatic increases in wheat yields that began in the mid-1930's in the United States will soon begin to level off. The favorable mix of genetics and technology that has characterized this era must build upon an ever higher yield base for the future. At the same time the residue of factors that can lower wheat yields includes a larger proportion of forces not easily shaped or controlled by man. An example is weather. The result is a natural yield ceiling that is already visible and that will impose a limit on future productivity growth.

Although Moloney leukemia virus stocks generally contain little or no free amphotropic virus, dilution analysis of several virus stocks and the examination of virus progeny from individual foci revealed that HIX virus is present and functionally coated with ecotropic Moloney virus envelopes. Because most mice have serum factors that inactivate recombinant viruses, masking may represent a general survival mechanism for HIX as well as other analogous recombinant viruses."

Glycophorin, the major sialoglycoprotein of the red cell membrane, was purified by two different methods; it contained approximately half of the total label incorporated into membrane proteins. The label was confined to the trypsin-insoluble peptide of glycophorin that includes a sequence of 20, mainly apolar, amino acids. These findings provide direct evidence that the labeled segment resides within the membrane in direct contact with the lipid bilayer, and support the suggestion that glycophorin spans the bilayer through its hydrophobic domain."

Developing a new and more effective vaccine is one way to possibly reduce the morbidity and mortality of TB. The Mtb72F vaccine is one of the important subunit vaccines applied in human clinical trials. In this study, we have constructed an expression vector that contains the Mtb72F fragment with some new modifications.In this experimental study, Mtb32N and Mtb39 fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers and inserted into pET21b\Mtb32C. Colony-PCR, restriction enzyme analysis, and DNA sequencing were used to confirm the accuracy of the cloning. We used Western blot to verify the desired protein expression.The amplified fragments showed the desired size in PCR and digestion methods, and protein expression was confirmed using a monoclonal antibody.Our modification made it possible to insert another gene or gene fragments into the Mtb72F vector for developing new constructs. In addition, our data has shown that the placement of the histidine tag in the carboxyl- (C-) or amino- (N-) terminal part of a protein may influence protein expression and/or stability."
https://openalex.org/W2051037651,"A number of cases of β0 thalassemia have been examined for the presence or absence of β-globin mRNA. Total RNA extracted from peripheral blood was hybridized to purified complementary DNA specific for β-globin mRNA, and to β-cDNA probes specific for the 5′ and 3′ noncoding regions of β-globin mRNA. Three clear-cut categories of β0 thalassemia were identified. The first type had no detectable β-globin mRNA. A second type had β-globin mRNA sequences which hybridized incompletely to the cDNA probes and probably represented mRNAs with grossly altered structures. A third type appeared to have essentially intact, though untranslatable, β-globin mRNA. Depurination products from 5′ and 3′ β-cDNAs synthesized from this latter mRNA were identical to those from normal β-globin mRNA, but the relative yields were different, suggesting a possible defect near the initiation codon."
https://openalex.org/W1996919418,"Amphotericin B is a polyene macrolide antibiotic which interacts specifically with sterols in mammalian cell membranes. Amphotericin B-resistant (AMBr) lines of stable phenotype have been isolated from cultured Chinese hamster (V79) cells. Three AMBr clones (AMBr-1, -2 and -3) isolated independently after treatment with nitrosoguanidine were resistant to greater than or equal to microgram/ml of the antibiotic, while DNA synthesis as well as the colony-forming ability of the parental V79 cells was blocked by greater than 80% of control in the presence of 20--50 microgram/ml amphotericin B. The AMBr cell line also exhibited increased resistance to other polyene macrolide antibiotics such as nystatin and pentamycin. Other agents, however, such as cytosine arabinoside or ricin, blocked DNA synthesis in AMBr cells to the same extent as in V79 cells. The amphotericin B resistance phenotype was stably retained even after AMBr cells were cultured in the absence of the drug for over 200 generations. The control of free cholesterol or its esters was significantly decreased in all three resistant clones. Furthermore, cholesterol synthesis from acetate as well as mevalonate was partly defective in AMBr cells, compared with that in V79 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969381782,"Cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are more resistant to dexamethasone toxicity than are normal cells. We now report that, when fibroblasts cultured from obligate CF heterozygotes are exposed to dexamethasone, they have an intermediate survival compared to normal and homozygous CF cells. When dexamethasone survival was tested on cells from four patients undergoing amniocentesis, cells from a woman at risk of producing a child with CF showed significant dexamethasone resistance, similar to that of fibroblasts derived from lnown CF homozygotes; the other amniotic cell specimens showed dexamethasone sensitivity similar to that of normal skin fibroblasts. These data suggest that the dexamethasone resistance previously observed in skin fibroblasts may also be useful in the prenatal diagnosis of CF."

Nearly identical oxygen binding curves are obtained upon oxygenation and deoxygenation of these solutions. The influence of aggregation is to shift the curve toward higher pressures."

The diffuse flashes have previously been observed by astronauts in space but not in laboratory experiments with particles of high atomic number and energy. They are observed only when the nucleus moves fast enough to generate Cerenkov radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1994607114,"Mirror symmetrical, double posterior limbs were produced by two types of operations on tailbud embryos of the axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum. When the limbs had grown to maturity, they were amputated and a study was made of the structures which regenerated in their place. The majority of the regenerates were also reduplicated, although a significant minority showed other types of symmetry. Reduplicate symmetry was often conserved following several amputations, but the number of skeletal elements present in each regenerate tended to vary: both expansion and contraction were found, the changes always occurring in the center of the pattern. These results are discussed in terms of the possible mechanisms for pattern formation in the anteroposterior axis during regeneration. We suggest that control of normal regeneration is carried out by a monotonic gradient of positional information which is originally set up to control pattern formation during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1981304608,"The hypothesis that rods mediate iconic storage was tested by presenting letters of one color against a field of another. The colors were chosen to be discriminable only by the cones, only by the rods, or both. Under dark adaptation, the rods had little if any effect on partial-report advantage; however, they were important in determining the phenomenal persistence of the stimulus. Under light adaptation, the rods played no apparent role in either type of persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2011639885,"Animals receiving low-intensity electrical stimulation of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala while drinking plain tap water were injected with toxic doses of lithium chloride to examine whether brain stimulation can serve as a conditioned stimulus in a bait-shyness paradigm. Subjects receiving this pairing greatly reduced their water intake in a retention test, in a similar manner to a group in which saccharin was paired with poisoning. Pairing lithium chloride with stimulation of the amygdala had no effect on subsequent water intake in the absence of brain stimulation. This effect appears to be locus specific, as caudate stimulation could not serve as a conditioned stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2068482223,"P3, a cell line derived from the plasmacytoma MOPC-21 secretes IgG1 (K) and is sensitive to complement (C')-mediated lysis by antibody directed against gamma1 or K. Sensitivity is attributed to the presence of immunoglobulin molecules on the surface membrane, designed Ig-mem. This sensitivity is abolished by antigenic modulation of Ig-mem. Modulated cells, when incubated in the absence of antibody, recover sensitivity to lysis in 4 hr. By measuring the rate of recovery, it has been possible to study the effects of various drugs on the reexpression of Ig-mem. Treatment of modulated cells with cycloheximide (Cx), pactamycin Pc), anisomycin (An), homoharringtonine (Ha) or sparsomycin (Sm), each a specific inhibitor of a different step in protein synthesis, produces a significant reduction in the rate of recovery. Paradoxically, puromycin (Pm), also a specific inhibitor of protein synthesis, does not reduce the rate of recovery. Studies were performed using Pm together with each of the other drugs to gain an understanding of the relationship between protein synthesis and recovery from modulation. Based upon these studies, we conclude that continued operation of the initiation cycle of protein synthesis is required for reexpression of Ig-mem in the absence of de novo protein formation."

For short-latency exogenous processes, latency and amplitude depend on the parameters of the physical stimulus. However, the amplitude and shape of longer-latency endogenous processes are essentially independent of the location and intensity of the signal source and seem to be invariant concomitants of the significance of the signal."
https://openalex.org/W2006191960,Disulfiram or diethyldithiocarbamate significantly enhanced the sleeping time induced by barbital in rats. At identical time intervals after rats were injected with barbital the concentration of barbital in the blood or brain of animals that had previously received disulfiram was significantly higher than the concentrations in the corresponding tissues of control animals. Urinary excretion of barbital was significantly reduced in disulfiram-treated animals.
https://openalex.org/W1987006777,"Continued progress in many areas of science depends on access to advanced modern instruments and the data they provide. Costly instruments have been shared in a number of disciplines for many years, and common patterns of shared usage have developed independently. The scientific and financial aspects of large instrument usage are discussed from the points of view of the instrument centers, the users, and the funding agencies. The instrument problem is not one problem but many, and coordinated solutions must be implemented with well-defined goals based on knowledge of the needs of the users and developers of instruments."
