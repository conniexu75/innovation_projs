https://openalex.org/W2978901899,"Prospecting for drugs in the microbiome The microbiome is an important source of natural products that can profoundly influence health and disease in the host. Sugimoto et al. constructed a modular, probabilistic strategy called MetaBGC to uncover biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in human microbiome samples (see the Perspective by Henke and Clardy). The authors found geographic and strain-specific distributions of BGCs. By zeroing in on two type II aromatic polyketides, the native organisms were identified, the BGCs were reconstructed in Streptomyces , and the products were characterized. When expressed in Bacillus subtilis , the products resembled currently used anticancer drugs and antibiotics. These polyketides were not cytotoxic but had inhibitory activity against oral Gram-positive bacteria, which may reflect the niche and ecology of the originating organisms.

How does that affect the fate of terrestrial organic carbon that enters the ocean? Blattmann et al. show that organic carbon derived from soils is stripped from mineral surfaces upon discharge and dispersal into the ocean, whereas organic matter derived from ancient rocks is preserved there. Their results show that preservation of continentally derived organic matter in marine sediments is controlled largely by phyllosilicate mineralogy. Science , this issue p. 742"

Courgeon and Desplan find that Dm8 neurons are actually specified in subtypes and are produced in excess. Those Dm8 neurons that connect to an R7 input survive; those that fail to find a match die by apoptosis. The matching is facilitated by a pair of cell adhesion molecules. The stochastic results of R7 differentiation are thus propagated downstream even though those downstream elements are not stochastically determined. Science , this issue p. eaay6727"
https://openalex.org/W2977326262,"The periaqueductal gray (PAG) in the midbrain is known to coordinate behavioral and autonomic responses to threat and injury through its descending projections to the brainstem. Here, we show that neurotensin (NTS)-expressing glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) powerfully promote non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep partly through their projection to the caudal medulla. Optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of vlPAG NTS neurons strongly enhanced NREM sleep, whereas their inactivation increased wakefulness. Calcium imaging and optrode recording showed that they are preferentially active during NREM sleep. The NREM-promoting effect of vlPAG NTS neurons is partly mediated by their projection to the caudal ventromedial medulla, where they excite GABAergic neurons. Bidirectional optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations showed that the medullary GABAergic neurons also promote NREM sleep, and they innervate multiple monoaminergic populations. Together, these findings reveal a novel pathway for NREM sleep generation, in which glutamatergic neurons drive broad GABAergic inhibition of wake-promoting neuronal populations."

Here we perform such a measurement for a direct energy cascade in a turbulent quantum gas. Using a time-periodic force, we inject energy at a large lengthscale and generate a cascade in a uniformly-trapped Bose gas. The adjustable trap depth provides a high-momentum cutoff $k_{\textrm{D}}$, which realises a synthetic dissipation scale. This gives us direct access to the particle flux across a momentum shell of radius $k_{\textrm{D}}$, and the tunability of $k_{\textrm{D}}$ allows for a clear demonstration of the zeroth law of turbulence: we observe that for fixed forcing the particle flux vanishes as $k_{\textrm{D}}^{-2}$ in the dissipationless limit $k_{\textrm{D}}\rightarrow \infty$, while the energy flux is independent of $k_{\textrm{D}}$. Moreover, our time-resolved measurements give unique access to the pre-steady-state dynamics, when the cascade front propagates in momentum space."
https://openalex.org/W2977660896,"Various agents including Ca. Piscichlamydia salmonis, Ca. Branchiomonas cysticola, Desmozoon lepeophtherii, Paramoeba perurans and salmon gill poxvirus may be associated with complex gill disease in Atlantic salmon. Co-infections involving two or more of these agents are common and histopathological interpretation of lesions is therefore challenging. In this study, we developed a semi-quantitative scoring system for examination of histopathological gill lesions in sea-farmed Atlantic salmon suffering from gill disease. Following qPCR analysis of gills sampled for Ca. P. salmonis, Ca. B. cysticola, D. lepeophtherii and P. perurans from 22 geographically spread outbreaks, five cases representing different infectious loads and combinations of agents were chosen for histopathological scoring. Twenty-eight histological features were evaluated and potential associations between individual pathological changes and the occurrence of individual agents studied. The inter-observer agreement in interpretation of histological parameters between the three pathologists involved, was calculated to validate robustness of the scoring scheme. Seventeen histological parameters met the criteria for inter-observer agreement analysis and were included in the calculation. The three most frequent findings were identification of subepithelial leukocytes, epithelial cell hyperplasia and mucus cell hyperplasia. While few findings could be specifically related to particular agents, necrosis in hyperplastic lesions, pustules and necrosis of subepithelial cells appeared to be associated with the presence of Ca. B. cysticola. Further, lesion profiles clearly support the previously identified association between P. perurans and pathological changes associated with AGD. Very few pathological changes were observed in the single case in which Ca. P. salmonis was the dominating agent. Some lesions were only very rarely observed e.g. chloride cell necrosis, epithelial cell apoptosis, lamellar deposition of melanin and haemophagocytosis. The scoring scheme developed and applied was robust and sensitive. A less extensive scheme for routine diagnostic use is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2978960713,"Rationale Multiple clinical trials support the effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT); however, optimal patient selection remains challenging due to substantial treatment heterogeneity among patients who meet the clinical practice guidelines. Objective To apply machine learning to create an algorithm that predicts CRT outcome using electronic health record (EHR) data avaible before the procedure. Methods and results We applied machine learning and natural language processing to the EHR of 990 patients who received CRT at two academic hospitals between 2004–2015. The primary outcome was reduced CRT benefit, defined as <0% improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 6–18 months post-procedure or death by 18 months. Data regarding demographics, laboratory values, medications, clinical characteristics, and past health services utilization were extracted from the EHR available before the CRT procedure. Bigrams (i.e., two-word sequences) were also extracted from the clinical notes using natural language processing. Patients accrued on average 75 clinical notes (SD, 29) before the procedure including data not captured anywhere else in the EHR. A machine learning model was built using 80% of the patient sample (training and validation dataset), and tested on a held-out 20% patient sample (test dataset). Among 990 patients receiving CRT the mean age was 71.6 (SD, 11.8), 78.1% were male, 87.2% non-Hispanic white, and the mean baseline LVEF was 24.8% (SD, 7.69). Out of 990 patients, 403 (40.7%) were identified as having a reduced benefit from the CRT device (<0% LVEF improvement in 25.2%, death by 18 months in 15.6%). The final model identified 26% of these patients at a positive predictive value of 79% (model performance: Fβ (β = 0.1): 77%; recall 0.26; precision 0.79; accuracy 0.65). Conclusions A machine learning model that leveraged readily available EHR data and clinical notes identified a subset of CRT patients who may not benefit from CRT before the procedure."

Patients were excluded for missing information, age <20 years old, history of AMI, liver transplant, autoimmune disease, coagulopathy, taking DAPT 3 months before index date, follow-up <3 months, anticoagulation user, without DAPT, and events of myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and heart failure within 3-month of enrollment. Primary outcomes were 1-year all-cause mortality, recurrent MI, major bleeding, and gastrointestinal bleeding.A total of 150,887 patients with AMI retrieved. After exclusion criteria and propensity score-matching, 914 cirrhotic and 3,656 non-cirrhotic patients with AMI on DAPT were studied. During 1-year follow-up, there was significantly increased mortality in cirrhotic patients compared to non-cirrhotic patients (HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.28-1.74). There was significantly decreased recurrent MI in cirrhotic patients compared to non-cirrhotic patients (subdistribution HR [SHR] = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.54-0.92). However, non-significantly increased major bleeding (SHR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.87-1.73) and significantly increased gastrointestinal bleeding (SHR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.31-1.70).In cirrhotic patients with AMI, DAPT offers benefit with decreased recurrent MI at the expense of increased gastrointestinal bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W2797527783,"Overweight and obesity have become global concerns in developed and developing countries due to their rise in recent years and their association with the prevalence of non-communicable diseases including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. In fact, it is estimated that roughly 39% of adults worldwide are overweight and 13% are obese. Ecuador is an example of a developing country concerned with the overweight and obesity problem, where it is estimated that 30% of children, 26% of teenagers and 63% of adults are either overweight or obese and where 1 in 4 deaths are attributed to chronic diseases. To address the overweight and obesity problem via the promotion of healthy eating habits, in 2013 the country approved technical regulation for the labelling of packed processed food products. The regulation included a mandatory traffic-light (TL) supplemental nutritional information labelling system to be displayed on the package of all processed foods for sale in the country. This new labelling system displays a traffic light panel for the product content of sugar, fat and salt in addition to the traditional nutrient declaration label. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effect of the TL supplemental nutritional information on consumers’ buying behavior in Ecuador. More specifically, we concentrated on the purchasing behavior of carbonated soft drinks. For our analysis, we used monthly aggregated purchase data (total expenditures, quantities and average prices) of carbonated soft drinks from January 2013 to December 2015 obtained from Kantar World Panel—Ecuador. We estimated a non-linear Almost Ideal Demand System where we model the demand for high sugar and low sugar carbonated soft drinks. We found that the introduction of the traffic light supplemental nutrition labelling did not have the expected effect of reducing purchases of carbonated soft drinks during its first year of implementation, especially those high in sugar. Additionally, we found that lower income-status households tend to spend more on and consume more calories from CSD than households with higher socio-economic status. Finally, we identified that over time purchases of high sugar soft drinks decreased while purchases of low and no sugar soft drinks increased. Beyond our contribution of evaluating the effect of the traffic light on the purchases of carbonated soft drinks, we also estimated price and income elasticities of carbonated soft drinks which can be useful in the evaluation of fiscal policies."
https://openalex.org/W2977712381,"Experimental and comparative studies suggest that the striped coats of zebras can prevent biting fly attacks. Biting flies are serious pests of livestock that cause economic losses in animal production. We hypothesized that cows painted with black and white stripes on their body could avoid biting fly attacks and show fewer fly-repelling behaviors. Six Japanese Black cows were assigned to treatments using a 3 × 3 Latin-square design. The treatments were black-and-white painted stripes, black painted stripes, and no stripes (all-black body surface). Recorded fly-repelling behaviors were head throw, ear beat, leg stamp, skin twitch, and tail flick. Photo images of the right side of each cow were taken using a commercial digital camera after every observation and biting flies on the body and each leg were counted from the photo images. Here we show that the numbers of biting flies on Japanese Black cows painted with black-and-white stripes were significantly lower than those on non-painted cows and cows painted only with black stripes. The frequencies of fly-repelling behaviors in cows painted with black-and-white stripes were also lower than those in the non-painted and black-striped cows. These results thus suggest that painting black-and-white stripes on livestock such as cattle can prevent biting fly attacks and provide an alternative method of defending livestock against biting flies without using pesticides in animal production, thereby proposing a solution for the problem of pesticide resistance in the environment."

Objectives To assess isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) initiation and completion, factors associated with IPT uptake and incidence of TB, and TB and antiretroviral treatment (ART) outcomes among people living with HIV (PLHIV). Design This was a cohort study using routine data in the records for PLHIV initiated on ART from October 2013 to March 2014 with 31 December 2017 as the end of the follow-up period. Results A total of 408 PLHIV were eligible for IPT, 214 (52%) were initiated on IPT and 201 (94%) completed IPT. No person in the IPT-initiated group developed Tuberculosis (TB). Six persons with TB were reported among the non-IPT-initiated group leading to an incidence of 9 cases/1,000 person-years of follow-up. About 70% of those who developed and were treated for TB had a successful TB treatment outcome. The survival on ART at four years of follow-up was 88% among the IPT-initiated PLHIV that was significantly higher than the 75% survival in the group not- initiated on IPT. Conclusion The study revealed low IPT initiation among eligible PLHIV who, if started on IPT, completed the six month regimen. TB was reported only among the PLHIV not-initiated on IPT and the four year ART survival was higher in the IPT-initiated group than in the non-initiated group. These findings reinforce the need to strengthen IPT uptake among PLHIV in Bulawayo."
https://openalex.org/W2979072591,"The need for a validated set of emotional clips to elicit emotions in more ecological experiments is increasing. Here we present the validation of a new database of emotional films, named E-MOVIE, which includes, in this first validation phase, 39 excerpts arranged in six categories, three negative (Fear, Sadness and Compassion), two positive (Erotic and Scenery) and a Neutral category. Notably, Compassion and Scenery are new in the field as they were not included in other databases. The clips in E-MOVIE are characterized by homogenous durations of approximately two minutes, which make them suitable for psychophysiological research. In order to study the affective profile prompted by each category 174 participants (112 women) rated the movies on multiple dimensions, namely valence and arousal, intensity and discreteness of the induction of one of the six basic emotions and, finally, intensity of the experience of the emotional states defined by a series of emotional adjectives. Erotic clips were effective in the elicitation of a positive emotional state, characterized by high levels of arousal and excitement. On the other hand, Fear clips (selected without blood to avoid disgust reaction) prompted an affect characterized by high arousal, low valence and high levels of reported fear and anxiety. Women reported greater unpleasantness, distress, anxiety and jittery than men to the three negative categories. Compassion clips, characterized by the depiction of crying characters, were able to induce an affective state dominated by sadness and feeling touched, consistent with an empathic reaction to emotional sufferance. Sadness clips, instead, elicited an affective state characterized by sadness together with distress and angst. We also demonstrated that clips depicting natural environments (i.e. Scenery) prompted in the viewer a surprised, inspired affective state, characterized by high valence and arousal (especially in males), a result which suggests that their past categorization as neutral stimuli was inaccurate and problematic."
https://openalex.org/W2979076895,"We have previously demonstrated that loss of the tumor suppressive activity of ribosomal protein (RP) RPL22 predisposes to development of leukemia in mouse models and aggressive disease in human patients; however, the role of RPL22 in solid tumors, specifically colorectal cancer (CRC), had not been explored. We report here that RPL22 is either deleted or mutated in 36% of CRC and provide new insights into its mechanism of action. Indeed, Rpl22 inactivation causes the induction of its highly homologous paralog, RPL22L1, which serves as a driver of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in CRC cells. Moreover, RPL22L1 protein is highly expressed in patient CRC samples and correlates with poor survival. Interestingly, the association of high RPL22L1 expression with poor prognosis appears to be linked to resistance to 5-Fluorouracil, which is a core component of most CRC therapeutic regimens. Indeed, in an avatar trial, we found that human CRC samples that were unresponsive to 5-Fluorouracil in patient-derived xenografts exhibited elevated expression levels of RPL22L1. This link between RPL22L1 induction and 5-Fluorouracil resistance appears to be causal, because ectopic expression or knockdown of RPL22L1 in cell lines increases and decreases 5-Fluorouracil resistance, respectively, and this is associated with changes in expression of the DNA-repair genes, MGMT and MLH1. In summary, our data suggest that RPL22L1 might be a prognostic marker in CRC and predict 5-FU responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2977345063,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) accounts for about 40% of all nephrotic syndrome cases in adults. The presence of several potential circulating factors has been suggested in patients with primary FSGS and particularly in patients with recurrent disease after transplant. Irrespectively of the nature of the circulating factors, this study was aimed at identifying early glomerular/podocyte-specific pathways that are activated by the sera of patients affected by FSGS. Kidney biopsies were obtained from patients undergoing kidney transplantation due to primary FSGS. Donor kidneys were biopsied pre-reperfusion (PreR) and a subset 1–2 hours after reperfusion of the kidney (PostR). Thirty-one post reperfusion (PostR) and 36 PreR biopsy samples were analyzed by microarray and gene enrichment KEGG pathway analysis. Data were compared to those obtained from patients with incident primary FSGS enrolled in other cohorts as well as with another cohort to correct for pathways activated by ischemia reperfusion. Using an ex-vivo cell-based assay in which human podocytes were cultured in the presence of sera from patients with recurrent and non recurrent FSGS, the molecular signature of podocytes exposed to sera from patients with REC was compared to the one established from patients with NON REC. We demonstrate that inflammatory pathways, including the TNF pathway, are primarily activated immediately after exposure to the sera of patients with primary FSGS, while phagocytotic pathways are activated when proteinuria becomes clinically evident. The TNF pathway activation by one or more circulating factors present in the sera of patients with FSGS supports prior experimental findings from our group demonstrating a causative role of local TNF in podocyte injury in FSGS. Correlation analysis with clinical and histological parameters of disease was performed and further supported a possible role for TNF pathway activation in FSGS. Additionally, we identified a unique set of genes that is specifically activated in podocytes when cultured in the presence of serum of patients with REC FSGS. This clinical translational study supports our prior experimental findings describing a potential role of the TNF pathway in the pathogenesis of FSGS. Validation of these findings in larger cohorts may lay the ground for the implementation of integrated system biology approaches to risk stratify patients affected by FSGS and to identify novel pathways relevant to podocyte injury."
https://openalex.org/W2978850149,"The aim of this study was to identify changes in skin function associated with obesity and the mechanisms underlying these changes. Functional changes and gene expression in skin were investigated in C57BL/6J mice fed either a control or high-fat diet (HFD). The insulin responsiveness of the skin and skeletal muscle was also evaluated. The effects of inhibiting insulin signaling and altered glucose concentration on skin function-associated molecules and barrier function were analyzed in keratinocytes. HFD-fed mice were not only severely obese, but also exhibited impaired skin barrier function and diminished levels of glycerol transporter aquaporin-3, keratins, and desmosomal proteins involved in maintaining skin structure. Moreover, the expression of cell cycle regulatory molecules was altered. Insulin signaling was attenuated in the skin and skeletal muscle of HFD-fed mice. In keratinocytes, inhibition of insulin signaling leads to decreased keratin expression and diminished barrier function, and higher glucose concentrations increased the expression of CDK inhibitor 1A and 1C, which are associated with cell-cycle arrest. Obesity-associated impairment of skin function can be attributed to structural fragility, abnormal glycerol transport, and dysregulated proliferation of epidermal cells. These alterations are at least partly due to cutaneous insulin resistance and hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2978741928,"Olanzapine (OLZ) is a second-generation antipsychotic that is used to treat schizophrenia but also causes acute hyperglycemia. This study aimed to determine if the ablation of AMPK β1-containing complexes potentiates acute OLZ-induced metabolic dysfunction and if the activation of AMPK β1 suppresses these effects. Female AMPK β1-/- or wild-type (WT) control mice were treated with OLZ, and changes in blood glucose, serum and liver metabolites, whole-body fuel oxidation, and pyruvate-induced increases in blood glucose were measured. Additionally, WT mice were cotreated with OLZ and A769662, a specific AMPK β1 activator, and we determined if cotreatment protected against acute, OLZ-induced metabolic dysfunction. OLZ-induced increases in blood glucose were exacerbated in AMPK β1-/- mice compared with WT mice, and this was paralleled by greater OLZ-induced increases in markers of liver glucose production, such as pyruvate tolerance, serum glucagon, and glucagon responsiveness. Cotreatment with A769662 attenuated OLZ-induced increases in blood glucose, serum nonesterified fatty acid, and glycerol. Furthermore, this effect was absent in AMPK β1-/- mice, consistent with A769662's specificity for the AMPK β1 subunit. Reductions in AMPK activity potentiate the effects of acute OLZ treatment on blood glucose, whereas specifically targeting AMPK β1-containing complexes is sufficient to protect against OLZ-induced hyperglycemia.-Shamshoum, H., Medak, K.

https://openalex.org/W2977667421,"Visual hand gesture recognition systems are promising technologies for Human Computer Interaction, as they allow a more immersive and intuitive interaction. Most of these systems are based on the analysis of skeleton information, which is in turn inferred from color, depth, or near-infrared imagery. However, the robust extraction of skeleton information from images is only possible for a subset of hand poses, which restricts the range of gestures that can be recognized. In this paper, a real-time hand gesture recognition system based on a near-infrared device is presented, which directly analyzes the infrared imagery to infer static and dynamic gestures, without using skeleton information. Thus, a much wider range of hand gestures can be recognized in comparison with skeleton-based approaches. To validate the proposed system, a new dataset of near-infrared imagery has been created, from which good results that outperform other state-of-the-art strategies have been obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2978116648,"Discontinuous electroencephalographic activity in children is thought to reflect brain inactivation. Discontinuity has been observed in states of pathology, where it is predictive of adverse neurological outcome, as well as under general anesthesia. Though in preterm-infants discontinuity reflects normal brain development, less is known regarding its role in term children, particularly in the setting of general anesthesia. Here, we conduct a post-hoc exploratory analysis to investigate the spectral features of discontinuous activity in children under general anesthesia.We previously recorded electroencephalography in children less than forty months of age under general anesthesia (n = 65). We characterized the relationship between age, anesthetic depth, and discontinuous activity, and used multitaper spectral methods to compare the power spectra of subjects with (n = 35) and without (n = 30) discontinuous activity. In the subjects with discontinuous activity, we examined the amplitude and power spectra associated with the discontinuities and analyzed how these variables varied with age.Cumulative time of discontinuity was associated with increased anesthetic depth and younger age. In particular, age-matched children with discontinuity received higher doses of propofol during induction as compared with children without discontinuity. In the tens of seconds preceding the onset of discontinuous activity, there was a decrease in high-frequency power in children four months and older that could be visually observed with spectrograms. During discontinuous activity, there were distinctive patterns of amplitude, spectral edge, and power in canonical frequency bands that varied with age. Notably, there was a decline in spectral edge in the seconds immediately following each discontinuity.Discontinuous activity in children reflects a state of a younger or more deeply anesthetized brain, and characteristic features of discontinuous activity evolve with age and may reflect neurodevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W2978899442,"In utero overnutrition can predispose offspring to metabolic disease. Although the mechanisms are unclear, increased oxidative stress accelerating cellular aging has been shown to play a role. Mitochondria are the main site of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in most cell types. Levels of ROS and the risk for oxidative damage are dictated by the balance between ROS production and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Originally considered as toxic species, physiologic levels of ROS are now known to be essential cell signaling molecules. Using a model of maternal overnutrition in C57BL6N mice, we investigate the mechanisms involved in the development of insulin resistance (IR) in muscle. In red and white gastrocnemius muscles of offspring, we are the first to report characteristics of oxidative phosphorylation, H 2 O 2 production, activity of mitoflashes, and electron transport chain supercomplex formation. Results demonstrate altered mitochondrial function with reduced response to glucose in offspring of mice fed a high‐fat and high‐sucrose diet, increases in mitochondrial leak respiration, and a reduction in ROS production in red gastrocnemius in response to palmitoyl carnitine. We also demonstrate differences in supercomplex formation between red and white gastrocnemius, which may be integral to fiber‐type specialization. We conclude that in this model of maternal overnutrition, mitochondrial alterations occur before the development of IR.—McMurray, F., MacFarlane, M., Kim, K., Patten, D.

https://openalex.org/W2977259550,"Background Linezolid has shown strong antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR)/rifampin-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Linezolid achieves clinical efficacy mainly through area under the concentration time curve/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio in the infected lesion site. Previous studies mainly focused on the relationship between linezolid concentrations in the blood and infected bone tissue when the blood drug concentration reached the peak 2 h after administration. However, we do not know whether linezolid can maintain the same bone/plasma ratio in infected bone tissue when the blood concentration reaches the trough level. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the penetrability of linezolid into bone tissue 24 h after administration in patients with MDR spinal tuberculosis (TB). Methods Nine MDR spinal TB patients, who received a treatment regimen including linezolid and underwent surgery, were enrolled prospectively from April 2017 to March 2019. Blood and diseased bone tissue specimens were collected simultaneously during operations 24 h after taking 600 mg of linezolid orally. Linezolid concentrations in plasma and diseased bone tissue specimens were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Results Following a 600 mg oral administration of linezolid 24 h before surgery, median concentrations of linezolid in plasma and diseased bone tissue for the 9 patients were 1.98 mg/L (range 0.30–3.44 mg/L) and 0.60 mg/L (range 0.18–2.13 mg/L), respectively, at resection time. The median diseased bone/plasma linezolid concentration ratio was 0.48 (range 0.30–0.67). Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that linezolid concentrations in the plasma were positively related to those in diseased bone tissue (r = 0.949, p < 0.001). Conclusions After 24 h of medication, linezolid still had good penetrability into diseased bone tissue in patients with MDR spinal TB."
https://openalex.org/W2978294662,"Previous studies reported a significant association between postural control and lower-limb strength of several muscle groups, however, they were focused especially on knee muscles and ankle plantar and dorsal flexors. The aim of the present study is to examine the correlation between the muscle strength of ankle invertors, evertors, plantar flexors, and dorsal flexors and the control of bipedal stance in young and older adults. Thirty one young (aged 22.8 ± 2.6 years) and thirty one older adults (aged 70.5 ± 7.2 years) voluntarily participated in this study. Ankle muscle strength was evaluated by an isokinetic dynamometer. Normalized peak torque and work were averaged for four repetitions and for both lower limbs. The control of bipedal stance was evaluated by the sample entropy derived from an accelerometer placed on the lumbar spine while the subject stood on a foam pad with eyes open. Results showed significant age-related differences in ankle muscle strength and sample entropy in medial-lateral direction. More interestingly, the correlation between ankle muscle strength and the sample entropy was significantly different between young and older adults. Indeed, no significant correlation was observed in the younger adults. Conversely, in the older adults, the work of the ankle evertors positively correlated with sample entropy in the medial-lateral direction during bipedal stance (r = 0.36), whereas the peak torque and work of the dorsal flexors were significantly correlated with sample entropy in the anterior-posterior direction during bipedal stance (r = 0.44 for both variables). In the young adults, results suggest that, standing on foam with eyes open is a relatively easy postural task that does not require the full ankle muscle strength capacity. Taken together, the present findings suggest that older adults have a different association between ankle muscle strength and the sample entropy during bipedal stance."
https://openalex.org/W2977784514,"Worldwide, around 18 million people receive a cancer diagnosis each year, most of whom survive long enough to face additional cancer-related costs. In France, most costs directly related to cancer are covered by the National Health Insurance Fund, and cancer patients can receive treatments without paying advance fees. In this context, the costs faced by cancer survivors are mostly social costs. Drawing on fundamental cause theory, this study aimed to explore the socially-differentiated evolution of cancer survivor’s income five years after diagnosis. Our study draws on the findings of VICAN5, a French national survey that was conducted in 2015/2016 in a representative sample of 4,174 cancer survivors to obtain information on living conditions five years after diagnosis, and that was restricted to 12 tumour sites accounting for 88% of global cancer incidence in France. We used the multiple imputation method and the Heckman selection model to identify the factors associated with a decrease in household income per consumption unit (HICU), while accounting for missing data. Among survivors still working five years after diagnosis, 17.6% reported lower income at survey than at diagnosis. After adjustment for socio-demographic and medical characteristics, the decrease in HICU was more frequent in women, singles, low educated survivors, and survivors with reduced working time. Finally, subjective measures of income variation and economic well-being were a useful complement to objective measures since 31.6% of cancer survivors still working five years after diagnosis reported a perceived decrease in household income. In conclusion, inequalities in economic well-being persist long after diagnosis in France, and this despite the fact that most cancer-related costs are covered by the French National Health Insurance Fund. Consequently, more attention should be paid to cancer patients with low socio-economic status to help reduce inequalities in post-diagnosis living conditions."

Significant macrogeographical population differentiation was observed among Lu. longipalpis populations via PCA and DAPC analyses. Our results revealed that populations of Lu. longipalpis from the nine municipalities were grouped into three clusters. In addition, it was observed that the levels of Lu. longipalpis population structure could be associated with distance isolation. This new sequencing method allowed us to study different molecular markers after a single sequencing run, and to evaluate population and inter-species differences on a macrogeographic scale."

We investigated changes in functional and structural connectivity among regions that support memory function in prodromal Alzheimer's disease, i.e., during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage.Twenty-three older healthy controls and 25 adults with MCI underwent multimodal MRI scanning. Limbic white matter tracts-the fornix, parahippocampal cingulum, retrosplenial cingulum, subgenual cingulum and uncinate fasciculus-were reconstructed in ExploreDTI using constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography. Using a network-of-interest approach, resting-state functional connectivity time-series correlations among sub-parcellations of the default mode and limbic networks, the hippocampus and the thalamus were calculated in Conn.Controlling for age, education, and gender between group linear regressions of five diffusion-weighted measures and of resting state connectivity measures were performed per hemisphere. FDR-corrections were performed within each class of measures. Correlations of within-network Fisher Z-transformed correlation coefficients and the mean diffusivity per tract were performed. Whole-brain graph theory measures of cluster coefficient and average path length were inspecting using the resting state data.MCI-related changes in white matter structure were found in the fornix, left parahippocampal cingulum, left retrosplenial cingulum and left subgenual cingulum. Functional connectivity decreases were observed in the MCI group within the DMN-a sub-network, between the hippocampus and sub-areas -a and -c of the DMN, between DMN-c and DMN-a, and, in the right hemisphere only between DMN-c and both the thalamus and limbic-a. No relationships between white matter tract 'integrity' (mean diffusivity) and within sub-network functional connectivity were found. Graph theory revealed that changes in the MCI group was mostly restricted to diminished between-neighbour connections of the hippocampi and of nodes within DMN-a and DMN-b."
https://openalex.org/W2977252081,"Background Health outcomes and causality are usually assessed with individual level sociodemographic variables. Studies that consider only individual-level variables can suffer from residual confounding. This can result in individual variables that are unrelated to risk behaving as proxies for uncaptured information. There is a scarcity of literature on risk factors for snakebite. In this study, we evaluate the individual-level risk factors of snakebite in Sri Lanka and highlight the impact of spatial confounding on determining the individual-level risk effects. Methods Data was obtained from the National Snakebite Survey of Sri Lanka. This was an Island-wide community-based survey. The survey sampled 165,665 individuals from all 25 districts of the country. We used generalized linear models to identify individual-level factors that contribute to an individual’s risk of experiencing a snakebite event. We fitted separate models to assess risk factors with and without considering spatial variation in snakebite incidence in the country. Results Both spatially adjusted and non-adjusted models revealed that middle-aged people, males, field workers and individuals with low level of education have high risk of snakebites. The model without spatial adjustment showed an interaction between ethnicity and income levels. When the model included a spatial adjustment for the overall snakebite incidence, this interaction disappeared and income level appeared as an independent risk factor. Both models showed similar effect sizes for gender and age. HEmployment and education showed lower effect sizes in the spatially adjusted model. Conclusions Both individual-level characteristics and local snakebite incidence are important to determine snakebite risk at a given location. Individual level variables could act as proxies for underling residual spatial variation when environmental information is not considered. This can lead to misinterpretation of risk factors and biased estimates of effect sizes. Both individual-level and environmental variables are important in assessing causality in epidemiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2977494293,"Trauma and hemorrhagic shock can lead to acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) that is not fully reversed by prehospital resuscitation as simulated with a limited volume of fresh whole blood (FWB) in a rat model. Tranexamic Acid (TXA) is used as an anti-fibrinolytic agent to reduce surgical bleeding if administered prior to or during surgery, and to improve survival in trauma if given early after trauma. It is not clear from the existing clinical literature whether TXA has the same mechanism of action in both settings. This study sought to explore the molecular mechanisms of TXA activity in trauma and determine whether administration of TXA as a supplement to FWB resuscitation could attenuate the established ATC in a rat model simulating prehospital resuscitation of polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock. In a parallel in-vitro study, the effects on clotting assays of adding plasmin at varying doses along with either simultaneous addition of TXA or pre-incubation with TXA were measured, and the results suggested that maximum anti-fibrinolytic effect of TXA on plasmin-induced fibrinolysis required pre-incubation of TXA and plasmin prior to clot initiation. In the rat model, ATC was induced by polytrauma followed by 40% hemorrhage. One hour after trauma, the rats were resuscitated with FWB collected from donor rats. Vehicle or TXA (10mg/kg) was given as bolus either before trauma (TXA-BT), or 45min after trauma prior to resuscitation (TXA-AT). The TXA-BT group was included to contrast the coagulation effects of TXA when used as it is in elective surgery vs. what is actually feasible in real trauma patients (TXA-AT group). A single dose of TXA prior to trauma significantly delayed the onset of ATC from 30min to 120min after trauma as measured by a rise in prothrombin time (PT). The plasma d-dimer as well as plasminogen/fibrinogen ratio in traumatized liver of TXA-BT were significantly lower as compared to vehicle and TXA-AT. Wet/dry weight ratio and leukocytes infiltration of lungs were significantly decreased only if TXA was administrated later, prior to resuscitation (TXA-AT). In conclusion: Limited prehospital trauma resuscitation that includes FWB and TXA may not correct established systemic ATC, but rather may improve overall outcomes of resuscitation by attenuation of acute lung injury. By contrast, TXA given prior to trauma reduced levels of fibrinolysis at the site of tissue injury and circulatory d-dimer, and delayed development of coagulopathy independent of reduction of fibrinogen levels following trauma. These findings highlight the importance of early administration of TXA in trauma, and suggest that further optimization of dosing protocols in trauma to exploit TXA’s various sites and modes of action may further improve patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2979035906,"Pseudomonas putida is one of 13 major groups of Pseudomonas spp. and contains numerous species occupying diverse niches and performing many functions such as plant growth promotion and bioremediation. Here we compared a set of 19 P. putida isolates obtained from sugarcane rhizosphere or bulk soil using a population genomics approach aiming to assess genomic and metabolic differences between populations from these habitats. Phylogenomics placed rhizosphere versus bulk soil strains in separate clades clustering with different type strains of the P. putida group. Multivariate analyses indicated that the rhizosphere and bulk soil isolates form distinct populations. Comparative genomics identified several genetic functions (GO-terms) significantly different between populations, including some exclusively present in the rhizosphere or bulk soil strains, such as D-galactonic acid catabolism and cellulose biosynthesis, respectively. The metabolic profiles of rhizosphere and bulk soil populations analyzed by Biolog Ecoplates also differ significantly, most notably by the higher oxidation of D-galactonic/D-galacturonic acid by the rhizosphere population. Accordingly, D-galactonate catabolism operon (dgo) was present in all rhizosphere isolates and absent in the bulk soil population. This study showed that sugarcane rhizosphere and bulk soil harbor different populations of P. putida and identified genes and functions potentially associated with their soil niches."
https://openalex.org/W2979188248,"This study's main objective was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the interRAI Community Health Assessment (CHA) for detecting the presence of vision loss (VL), hearing loss (HL) or both (Dual Sensory Loss, DSL) when compared against performance-based measures of vision and hearing. The interRAI CHA and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered to 200 adults (61+ years of age) who had VL, HL or DSL. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the interRAI CHA for detecting sensory impairments using as the gold standard performance based measurements of hearing (pure-tone audiogram) and vision (distance acuity) as determined from the rehabilitation centre record. Results were divided according to participants' cognitive status, as measured by the MoCA and the Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS, embedded within the interRAI CHA). Overall, sensitivity was 100% for VL, 97.1% for HL, and 96.9% for DSL. Specificity was at least 93% in all three groups. In participants who failed the MoCA (i.e., at risk of mild cognitive impairment), the sensitivity was 100% for VL, 96.8% for HL and 96.2% for DSL; in those who were not at risk, the sensitivity was 100% for VL, and 97.4% for HL and DSL. In participants classified by the CPS as borderline intact or mild cognitively impaired, sensitivity was 100% in all groups; in those classified as cognitively intact, sensitivity was 100% for VL, 97.0% for HL, and 96.8% for DSL. These results suggest that the interRAI CHA detects VL, HL, and DSL in high agreement with performance-based measurements of vision and hearing. The interRAI CHA shows high accuracy even in participants with mild cognitive difficulties. Since results were found in a specific population of older rehabilitation clients who all had sensory difficulties, further research is needed to understand its role in screening in other more diverse groups."
https://openalex.org/W2979207152,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant cancers and the treatment options for this disease are limited and generally not effective. ROCK has been reported to be highly expressed in many cancer types and its inhibitor Fasudil has shown anti-cancer potential. However, its high toxicity and low solubility restrict its clinical application. Here, we report that Fasudil is effective against HCC and that a liposomal formulation (Lip-Fasudil) can enhance the anti-tumor effects of this drug both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, Fasudil inhibited HCC cell growth with IC50 values of 0.025–0.04 μg/μL, with Lip-Fasudil showing slightly improved cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 0.02–0.025 μg/μL. Cellular mechanistic analysis indicated that Fasudil induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and that Lip-Fasudil enhanced this effect. Intriguingly, no apoptosis was detected in Fasudil- or Lip-Fasudil-treated HCC cells. In vivo, Fasudil inhibited the growth of HCC xenografts by 23% in nude mice. However, Lip-fasudil exerted anti-tumor effects (57% tumor inhibition) that were superior to those of Fasudil and similar to those of Topotecan (66%). In addition, Lip-fasudil resulted in an increased distribution of Fasudil in tumor tissues but a reduced distribution in normal organs. In conclusion, our results proved that Fasudil has the potential to be used for HCC treatment and that a liposomal formulation (Lip-Fasudil) could enhance anti-tumor efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2978011325,"While Kedah has recorded the highest prevalence of diabetes among all the states in Malaysia, the information on the practice and effectiveness of disease management in public health institutions remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the management and glycemic control of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at the primary care level in Kedah.All T2DM patients, who made at least one visit to any of the 58 public health clinics in Kedah during August 2016 and July 2017, were included in this study. The sample was selected from the National Diabetes Registry using the stratified random sampling method. The information on the demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and pharmacological treatment was gathered from medical records of patients. The differences in mean HbA1C levels across subgroups of each variable were tested using the general linear model. The evaluation of the appropriateness of treatment was performed based on the recommendations of the latest Clinical Practice Guidelines for T2DM.The patients (n = 23,557) were mainly female (63.4%), of Malay ethnicity (80.1%) and middle-aged (62.2%), with a mean duration of T2DM of 6.2±7.16 years. Only 15.6% of them had a HbA1C level <6.5%, and 28.6% did not have their HbA1C levels tested over the 12-month period. Yet, the underutilization of combination treatment (≥2 antidiabetic agents) and insulin in the patients with a poor glycemic control was evident. Retinopathy emerged as the most prevalent diabetes-related complication (12.6%). Along with those with a longer duration of T2DM, the patients who were younger, female and of Indian ethnicity were found to generally have a poorer glycemic control.This study discloses the suboptimal T2DM management at the primary care level in Kedah, which warrants a statewide plan for improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2978121752,"Exploration and exploitation are contradictory in differential evolution (DE) algorithm. In order to balance the search behavior between exploitation and exploration better, a novel self-adaptive dual-strategy differential evolution algorithm (SaDSDE) is proposed. Firstly, a dual-strategy mutation operator is presented based on the “DE/best/2” mutation operator with better global exploration ability and “DE/rand/2” mutation operator with stronger local exploitation ability. Secondly, the scaling factor self-adaption strategy is proposed in an individual-dependent and fitness-dependent way without extra parameters. Thirdly, the exploration ability control factor is introduced to adjust the global exploration ability dynamically in the evolution process. In order to verify and analyze the performance of SaDSDE, we compare SaDSDE with 7 state-of-art DE variants and 3 non-DE based algorithms by using 30 Benchmark test functions of 30-dimensions and 100-dimensions, respectively. The experiments results demonstrate that SaDSDE could improve global optimization performance remarkably. Moreover, the performance superiority of SaDSDE becomes more significant with the increase of the problems’ dimension."
https://openalex.org/W2977616387,"Intracranial germinoma sometimes present as bifocal germinoma, and whether bifocal germinoma should be treated as a synchronous or disseminated disease remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the optimal treatment modality for bifocal germinoma. Patients with bifocal germinoma who received radiotherapy (RT) from March 1990 to August 2017 were included for analysis. A total of 21 patients were included. The median follow-up period was 76.2 months (range, 6.2–305.4 months). There were 17 patients who received cranio-spinal irradiation (CSI) with local RT; 3, whole ventricular RT (WVRT) with local RT; and 1, local RT only. Three recurrences occurred (1 patient each among those who underwent CSI, WVRT, and local RT). Recurrence in the patient who received CSI and who received WVRT occurred in the right thalamus and right frontal convexity, respectively. Meanwhile, the patient who received local RT showed not only a recurred lesion in the hypothalamus, but also cerebrospinal fluid seeding. For this patient, salvage CSI was performed and complete response was achieved after treatment. However, after 9 years and 6 months, he was diagnosed with glioblastoma and expired. As for toxicity, although 17 patients showed decrease in complete blood count levels during treatment, all patients recovered soon after treatment completion. Our findings suggest that bifocal germinoma may be considered as a disseminated disease when considering the patterns of failure according to RT fields. In addition, patients who received CSI showed low acute toxicity rates. However, further studies are necessary to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2977654854,"Concentrations of free amino acids and [K+] in human sweat can be many times higher than in plasma. Conversely, [Na+] and [Cl-] in sweat are hypotonic to plasma. It was hypothesised that the amino acids and K+ were directly or indirectly associated with the resorption of Na+ and Cl- in the sweat duct. The implication would be that, as resources of these components became limiting during prolonged exercise then the capacity to resorb [Na+] and [Cl-] would diminish, resulting in progressively higher levels in sweat. If this were the case, then [Na+] and [Cl-] in sweat would have inverse relationships with [K+] and the amino acids during exercise. Forearm sweat was collected from 11 recreational athletes at regular intervals during a prolonged period of cycling exercise after 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 minutes. The subjects also provided passive sweat samples via 15 minutes of thermal stimulation. The sweat samples were analysed for concentrations of amino acids, Na+, Cl-, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+. The exercise sweat had a total amino acid concentration of 6.4 ± 1.2mM after 15 minutes which was lower than the passive sweat concentration at 11.6 ± 0.8mM (p<0.05) and showed an altered array of electrolytes, indicating that exercise stimulated a change in sweat composition. During the exercise period, [Na+] in sweat increased from 23.3 ± 3.0mM to 34.6 ± 2.4mM (p<0.01) over 65 minutes whilst the total concentrations of amino acids in sweat decreased from 6.4 ± 1.2mM to 3.6 ± 0.5mM. [Na+] showed significant negative correlations with the concentrations of total amino acids (r = -0.97, p<0.05), K+ (r = -0.93, p<0.05) and Ca2+ (r = -0.83, p<0.05) in sweat. The results supported the hypothesis that amino acids and K+, as well as Ca2+, were associated with resorption of Na+ and Cl-."
https://openalex.org/W2978666556,"The main purpose of this study was to explore the potential influences of pickleweed vegetation on the abundance, diversity and metabolic activities of microbial communities in four distinct areas of a petroleum-contaminated solid waste management unit (SWMU) located in Contra Costa County, northern California. The four areas sampled include two central areas, one of which is central vegetated (CV) and one unvegetated (UV), and two peripheral vegetated areas, one of which is located to the west side of the SWMU (V-West) and one located to the east side (V-East). Measurements were made of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), soil physicochemical properties, and various aspects of microbial communities including metabolic activities, microbial abundances (PLFAs), diversity and composition based on amplicon sequencing. The peripheral V-East and V-West sites had 10-times lower electrical conductivity (EC) than that of the CV and UV sites. The high salinity levels of the CV and UV sites were associated with significant reductions in bacterial and fungal abundances (PLFA) when compared to V-East but not when compared to V-West. TPH levels of CV and UV were not significantly different from those of V-West but were substantially lower than V-East TPH (19,311 mg/kg of dry soil), the high value of which may have been associated with a pipeline that ran through the area. Microbial activities (in terms of soil respiration and the activities of three soil enzymes, i.e., urease, lipase, and phosphatase) were greatest in the vegetated sites compared to the UV site. The prokaryotic community was not diverse as revealed by the Shannon index with no significant variation among the four groups of samples. However, the fungal community of the peripheral sites, V-East and V-West had significantly higher OTU richness and Shannon index. Structure of prokaryotic communities inhabiting the rhizosphere of pickleweed plants at the three sites differed significantly and were also different from those found in the UV region of the central site according to pairwise, global PERMANOVA and ANOSIM analyses. The differences in OTU-based rhizosphere-associated bacterial and fungal communities' composition were explained mainly by the changes in soil EC and pH. The results suggest that saline TPH-contaminated areas that are vegetated with pickleweed are likely to have increased abundances, diversity and metabolic activities in the rhizosphere compared to unvegetated areas, even in the presence of high salinity."
https://openalex.org/W2977445144,"Liquid biopsy of plasma is a simple and non-invasive technology that holds great promise in biomedical research. It is based on the analysis of nucleic acid-based biomarkers with predictive potential. In the present work, we have combined this concept with the FTA technology for sentinel mussels. We found that hemocytes collected from liquid biopsies can be readily fixed on FTA cards and used for long-term transcriptome analysis. We also showed that liquid biopsy is easily adaptable for metagenomic analysis of bacterial profiles of mussels. We finally provide evidence that liquid biopsies contained circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) which can be used as an easily accessible genomic reservoir. Sampling of FTA-fixed circulating nucleic acids is stable at room temperature and does not necessitate a cold-chain protection. It showed comparable performance to frozen samples and is ideally adapted for sampling in remote areas, most notably in polar regions threatened by anthropogenic activities. From an ethical point of view, this minimally-invasive and non-lethal approach further reduces incidental mortality associated with conventional tissue sampling. This liquid biopsy-based approach should thus facilitate biobanking activities and development of omics-based biomarkers in mussels to assess the quality of aquatic ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2977643247,"Agricultural activity, urban development and habitat alteration have caused the disappearance of the western spadefoot (Spea hammondii) from 80% of its geographic range in southern California. Despite the western spadefoot's continuing decline, little research has been conducted on its natural history. The home range of adult spadefoots is unknown, and their use of upland habitat is poorly understood. Both factors are important for the long-term conservation of the species because adult spadefoots spend the majority of their lives away from breeding pools in self-excavated burrows. Between January 2012 and January 2013, we surgically implanted radio transmitters in 15 spadefoots at two locations and recorded their movements and habitat use. The mean distance moved between burrow locations was 18 m (SD ± 24.1 m, range1-204 m). The mean distance of burrows from the breeding pools was 40 m (SD ± 37.42 m, range 1-262 m). Rain was a significant predictor of spadefoot movement, with more rain predicting higher probability of movement and larger distances moved. At remote sensing scale (1 m) spadefoots selected grassland habitat for their burrow locations. At the microsite scale (< 1 m) spadefoots strongly selected duff over grass or shrub cover. Spadefoots burrowed in friable, sandy/loam soil with significantly less clay than random pseudoabsence points. This research enhances our understanding of a little-studied species and will contribute to the development of effective management plans for the western spadefoot."
https://openalex.org/W2978680508,"Background Active management of third stage of labor is the most indispensable intervention to avert post-partum hemorrhage which is one of the typical causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess practice and factors associated with active management of third stage of labor among obstetric care providers in referral hospitals. Methods Institution based cross-sectional study design was conducted from April 1–30, 2018. Simple random sampling technique was used to select a total of 356 obstetric care providers. Data were collected using pretested, structured and self-administered questionnaires. Data were entered to Epi data version 3.1 statistical software and exported to SPSS 23 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify associated factors. P value <0.05 with 95% confidence level were used to declare statistical significance. Result This study revealed that practice of active management of third stage of labor was 61.2%. Age group of 20–30 years [AOR = 1.95 (95%CI;1.13–3.38)], Being male obstetric care provider [AOR = 1.74 (95%CI;1.03–2.94)], having work experience ≥2 years [AOR = 1.95(95%CI;1.13–3.38)], availability of oxytocin [AOR = 5.46 (95%CI; 2.41–12.3)], having exposure to manage third stage of labor [AOR = 2.91(95%CI; 1.55–5.48)], and having good knowledge [AOR = 2.67 (95%CI; 1.46–4.90)], were the factors associated with practice. Conclusion This study showed that practice of active management of third stage of labor was high. Age group between 20–30 years, being a male obstetric care provider, having ≥2years work experience, availability of oxytocin, exposure to third stage management and having good knowledge were factors associated with practice. Therefore, all referral hospitals and concerned bodies need efforts to focus on providing training to increase health care provider’s knowledge so as to sustain good practice through appropriate interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2979132534,"Background and objective Trial registration is widely endorsed as it is considered not only to enhance transparency and quality of reporting but also to help safeguard against outcome reporting bias and probably spin, known as specific reporting that could distort the interpretation of results thus mislead readers. We planned to investigate the current registration status of recently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture, outcome reporting bias in the prospectively registered trials, and the association between trial registration and presence of spin and methodological factors in acupuncture RCTs. Methods Acupuncture RCTs published in English in recent 5 years (January 2013 to December 2017) were searched in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE. Trial registration records identified in the publications and trial registries were classified into prospectively registered, retrospectively registered, or unregistered. Primary outcomes were identified and the direction of the results was judged as statistically significant (positive) or statistically nonsignificant (negative). We compared registered and published primary outcomes to assess outcome reporting bias and assessed whether discrepancies favored statistically significant outcomes. Frequency and strategies of spin in published reports with statistically nonsignificant results for primary outcomes were then identified. We also analyzed whether the trial registration status was associated with spin and quality of methodological factors. Results Of the 322 included RCTs, 41.9% (n = 135) were prospectively registered. Among 64 studies that were prospectively registered and specified primary outcomes, 25 trials had the discrepancies between the registered and published primary outcomes and 60% of them (15 trials) favored the statistically significant findings. Among 169 studies that specified primary outcomes, trial registration status was not associated with the direction of results, i.e., statistically significant or not. Spin was identified in 56.4% out of 78 studies with statistically nonsignificant primary outcomes and claiming efficacy with no consideration of statistically nonsignificant primary outcomes was the most common strategy for spin. Trial registration status was not statistically different between studies with and without spin. Conclusion While trial registration seemed to have improved over time, primary outcomes in registered records and publications were often inconsistent, tending to favor statistically significant findings and spin was common in studies with statistically nonsignificant primary outcomes. Journal editors and researchers in this field should be alerted to still prevalent reporting bias and spin."
https://openalex.org/W2978002895,"Receptor for Activated C Kinase-1 (RACK1) is a multifunctional eukaryotic scaffolding protein with a seven WD repeat structure. Among their many cellular roles, RACK1 homologs have been shown to serve as alternative Gβ subunits during heterotrimeric G protein signaling in many systems. We investigated genetic interactions between the RACK1 homolog cpc-2, the previously characterized Gβ subunit gnb-1 and other G protein signaling components in the multicellular filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Results from cell fractionation studies and from fluorescent microscopy of a strain expressing a CPC-2-GFP fusion protein revealed that CPC-2 is a cytoplasmic protein. Genetic epistasis experiments between cpc-2, the three Gα genes (gna-1, gna-2 and gna-3) and gnb-1 demonstrated that cpc-2 is epistatic to gna-2 with regards to basal hyphae growth rate and aerial hyphae height, while deletion of cpc-2 mitigates the increased macroconidiation on solid medium observed in Δgnb-1 mutants. Δcpc-2 mutants inappropriately produce conidiophores during growth in submerged culture and mutational activation of gna-3 alleviates this defect. Δcpc-2 mutants are female-sterile and fertility could not be restored by mutational activation of any of the three Gα genes. With the exception of macroconidiation on solid medium, double mutants lacking cpc-2 and gnb-1 exhibited more severe defects for all phenotypic traits, supporting a largely synergistic relationship between GNB-1 and CPC-2 in N. crassa."
https://openalex.org/W2978329214,"Oral herpes is a highly prevalent infection caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). After an initial infection of the oral cavity, HSV-1 remains latent in sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglia. Episodic reactivation of the virus leads to the formation of mucocutaneous lesions (cold sores), but asymptomatic reactivation accompanied by viral shedding is more frequent and allows virus spread to new hosts. HSV-1 DNA has been detected in many oral tissues. In particular, HSV-1 can be found in periodontal lesions and several studies associated its presence with more severe periodontitis pathologies. Since gingival fibroblasts may become exposed to salivary components in periodontitis lesions, we analyzed the effect of saliva on HSV-1 and -2 infection of these cells. We observed that human gingival fibroblasts can be infected by HSV-1. However, pre-treatment of these cells with saliva extracts from some but not all individuals led to an increased susceptibility to infection. Furthermore, the active saliva could expand HSV-1 tropism to cells that are normally resistant to infection due to the absence of HSV entry receptors. The active factor in saliva was partially purified and comprised high molecular weight complexes of glycoproteins that included secretory Immunoglobulin A. Interestingly, we observed a broad variation in the activity of saliva between donors suggesting that this activity is selectively present in the population. The active saliva factor, has not been isolated, but may lead to the identification of a relevant biomarker for susceptibility to oral herpes. The presence of a salivary factor that enhances HSV-1 infection may influence the risk of oral herpes and/or the severity of associated oral pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2978440342,"The spores of fungi come in a wide variety of forms and sizes, highly adapted to the route of dispersal and to survival under specific environmental conditions. The ascomycete Ashbya gossypii produces needle shaped spores with a length of 30 μm and a diameter of 1 μm. Formation of these spores relies on actin and actin regulatory proteins and is, therefore, distinct from the minor role that actin plays for spore formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using in vivo FRET-measurements of proteins labeled with fluorescent proteins, we investigate how the formin AgBnr2, a protein that promotes actin polymerization, integrates into the structure of the spindle pole body during sporulation. We also investigate the role of the A. gossypii homologs to the S. cerevisiae meiotic outer plaque proteins Spo74, Mpc54 and Ady4 for sporulation in A. gossypii. We found highest FRET of AgBnr2 with AgSpo74. Further experiments indicated that AgSpo74 is a main factor for targeting AgBnr2 to the spindle pole body. In agreement with these results, the Agspo74 deletion mutant produces no detectable spores, whereas deletion of Agmpc54 only has an effect on spore length and deletion of Agady4 has no detectable sporulation phenotype. Based on this study and in relation to previous results we suggest a model where AgBnr2 resides within an analogous structure to the meiotic outer plaque of S. cerevisiae. There it promotes formation of actin cables important for shaping the needle shaped spore structure."
https://openalex.org/W2977244459,"Humans can recall various aspects of a characteristic sound as a whole when they see a visual shape stimulus that has been intimately associated with the sound. In subjects with audio-visual associative memory, auditory responses that code the associated sound may be induced in the auditory cortex in response to presentation of the associated visual shape stimulus. To test this possibility, mice were pre-exposed to a combination of an artificial sound mimicking a cat's ""meow"" and a visual shape stimulus of concentric circles or stars for more than two weeks, since such passive exposure is known to be sufficient for inducing audio-visual associative memory in mice. After the exposure, we anesthetized the mice, and presented them with the associated visual shape stimulus. We found that associative responses in the auditory cortex were induced in response to the visual stimulus. The associative auditory responses were observed when complex sounds such as ""meow"" were used for formation of audio-visual associative memory, but not when a pure tone was used. These results suggest that associative auditory responses in the auditory cortex represent the characteristics of the complex sound stimulus as a whole."

This was a prospective study on saliva charts and collection (n = 70). Profile: male, 27 years old, blunt traumas and collisions. Serum parameters with normality: decrease in pH, creatinine at admission to Class I, and at 48 and 72 hours in both classes; K+ at 48 h in Class II; Ca+ on admission in both classes and at 72 h in Class I. Increase in urea at 72 h in Class II, glucose at all times and in all classes, and Ca+ at 48 h in both classes. Class II had high Na+ at 48 and 72 h compared to Class I. In Class I, creatinine reduction occurred in 48 h and 72 h compared to admission and an increase of Ca+ at 48 h with admission. In Class II, pH and Na+ increased at 48 h and 72 h compared to admission. K+ decreased from admission to 48 h and increased from 48 h to 72 h. Urea increased from 48 to 72 hours. Creatinine decreased from admission to 48 and 72 hours. Ca+ increased from admission to 48 hours and decreased from 48 to 72 hours. There was an increase in the saliva levels in both classes and times in relation to normality. There was an increase in urea at admission, glucose at 72 h, and Ca+ at 48 h in Class II compared with Class I. Class I urea increased from admission to 48 h and Ca+ decreased from admission to 48 h. Class II urea decreased from 48 h to 72 h. Strong or very strong positive correlation was identified between blood and creatinine saliva at all times and regular and negative Ca+ at 72 h. This study provides evidence that salivary and serum biomarkers can be used together to monitor the evolution of the clinical symptoms of ICU patients."
https://openalex.org/W2977511963,"The purpose of this study was to produce two statistical survival models in those with cirrhosis utilising only routine parameters, including non-liver-related clinical factors that influence survival. The first model identified and utilised factors impacting short-term survival to 90-days post incident diagnosis, and a further model characterised factors that impacted survival following this acute phase. Data were from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked with Hospital Episode Statistics. Incident cases in patients ≥18 years were identified between 1998 and 2014. Patients that had prior history of cancer or had received liver transplants prior were excluded. Model-1 used a logistic regression model to predict mortality. Model-2 used data from those patients who survived 90 days, and used an extension of the Cox regression model, adjusting for time-dependent covariables. At 90 days, 23% of patients had died. Overall median survival was 3.7 years. Model-1: numerous predictors, prior comorbidities and decompensating events were incorporated. All comorbidities contributed to increased odds of death, with renal disease having the largest adjusted odds ratio (OR = 3.35, 95%CI 2.97–3.77). Model-2: covariables included cumulative admissions for liver disease-related events and admissions for infections. Significant covariates were renal disease (adjusted hazard ratio (HR = 2.89, 2.47–3.38)), elevated bilirubin levels (aHR = 1.38, 1.26–1.51) and low sodium levels (aHR = 2.26, 1.84–2.78). An internal validation demonstrated reliability of both models. In conclusion: two survival models that included parameters commonly recorded in routine clinical practice were generated that reliably forecast the risk of death in patients with cirrhosis: in the acute, post diagnosis phase, and following this critical, 90 day phase. This has implications for practice and helps better forecast the risk of mortality from cirrhosis using routinely recorded parameters without inputs from specialists."
https://openalex.org/W2978312328,"The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has been successfully used to prioritize patients on the United States liver transplant waiting list since its adoption in 2002. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN) allocation policy has evolved over the years, and notable recent changes include Share 35, inclusion of serum sodium in the MELD score, and a 'delay and cap' policy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. We explored the potential of a registrant's change in 30-day MELD scores (ΔMELD30) to improve allocation both before and after these policy changes. Current MELD and ΔMELD30 were evaluated using cause-specific hazards models for waitlist dropout based on US liver transplant registrants added to the waitlist between 06/30/2003 and 6/30/2013. Two composite scores were constructed and then evaluated on UNOS data spanning the current policy era (01/02/2016 to 09/07/2018). Predictive accuracy was evaluated using the C-index for model discrimination and by comparing observed and predicted waitlist dropout probabilities for model calibration. After the change to MELD-Na, increased dropout associated with ΔMELD30 jumps is no longer evident at MELD scores below 30. However, the adoption of Share 35 has potentially resulted in discrepancies in waitlist dropout for patients with sharp MELD increases at higher MELD scores. Use of the ΔMELD30 to add additional points or serve as a potential tiebreaker for patients with rapid deterioration may extend the benefit of Share 35 to better include those in most critical need."
https://openalex.org/W2978967524,"Background Mild cognitive impairment is a common systemic manifestation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, its pathophysiological origins are not understood. Since, cognitive function relies on efficient communication between distributed cortical and subcortical regions, we investigated whether people with COPD have disruption in white matter connectivity. Methods Structural networks were constructed for 30 COPD patients (aged 54–84 years, 57% male, FEV1 52.5% pred.) and 23 controls (aged 51–81 years, 48% Male). Networks comprised 90 grey matter regions (nodes) interconnected by white mater fibre tracts traced using deterministic tractography (edges). Edges were weighted by the number of streamlines adjusted for a) streamline length and b) end-node volume. White matter connectivity was quantified using global and nodal graph metrics which characterised the networks connection density, connection strength, segregation, integration, nodal influence and small-worldness. Between-group differences in white matter connectivity and within-group associations with cognitive function and disease severity were tested. Results COPD patients’ brain networks had significantly lower global connection strength (p = 0.03) and connection density (p = 0.04). There was a trend towards COPD patients having a reduction in nodal connection density and connection strength across the majority of network nodes but this only reached significance for connection density in the right superior temporal gyrus (p = 0.02) and did not survive correction for end-node volume. There were no other significant global or nodal network differences or within-group associations with disease severity or cognitive function. Conclusion COPD brain networks show evidence of damage compared to controls with a reduced number and strength of connections. This loss of connectivity was not sufficient to disrupt the overall efficiency of network organisation, suggesting that it has redundant capacity that makes it resilient to damage, which may explain why cognitive dysfunction is not severe. This might also explain why no direct relationships could be found with cognitive measures. Smoking and hypertension are known to have deleterious effects on the brain. These confounding effects could not be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2977492512,"We examined whether the interplay between community disadvantage and a conduct disorder polygenic risk score (CD PRS) was associated with sexual health outcomes among urban women. Participants (N = 511; 75.5% African American) were originally recruited to participate in a school-based intervention and were followed into adulthood. Community disadvantage was calculated using census data when participants were in first grade. At age 20, blood or saliva samples were collected and participants reported on their condom use, sexual partners, and sexually transmitted infections. A CD PRS was created based on a genome-wide association study conducted by Dick et al. [2010]. Higher levels of community disadvantage was associated with greater sexually transmitted infections among women with a higher CD PRS. Implications of the study findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2979094145,"The transport and distribution of charged molecules in polyelectrolyte solutions are of both fundamental and practical importance. A practical example, which is the specific subject addressed in the present paper, is the transport and distribution of charged species into cartilage. The charged species could be a contrast agent or a drug molecule involved in diagnosis or treatment of the widespread degenerative disease osteoarthritis, which leads to degradation of articular cartilage. Associated scientific issues include the rate of transport and the equilibrium concentrations of the charged species in the cartilage and the synovial fluid. To address these questions, we present results from magnetic resonance micro-imaging experiments on a model system of articular cartilage. The experiments yield temporally and spatially resolved data on the transport of a negatively charged contrast agent (charge = -2), used in medical examinations of cartilage, into a polyelectrolyte solution, which is designed to capture the electrostatic interactions in cartilage. Also presented is a theoretical analysis of the transport where the relevant differential equations are solved using finite element techniques as well as treated with approximate analytical expressions. In the analysis, non-ideal effects are included in the treatment of the mobile species in the system. This is made possible by using results from previous Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate the importance of taking non-idealities into account when data from measurements of transport of charged solutes in a system with fixed charges from biological polyelectrolytes are analyzed."
