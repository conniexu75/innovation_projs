https://openalex.org/W2021333801,"The RNA moieties of ribonuclease P purified from both E. coli (M1 RNA) and B. subtilis (P-RNA) can cleave tRNA precursor molecules in buffers containing either 60 mM Mg2+ or 10 mM Mg2+ plus 1 mM spermidine. The RNA acts as a true catalyst under these conditions whereas the protein moieties of the enzymes alone show no catalytic activity. However, in buffers containing 5-10 mM Mg2+ (in the absence of spermidine) both kinds of subunits are required for enzymatic activity, as shown previously. In the presence of low concentrations of Mg2+, in vitro, the RNA and protein subunits from one species can complement subunits from the other species in reconstitution experiments. When the precursor to E. coli 4.5S RNA is used as a substrate, only the enzyme complexes formed with M1 RNA from E. coli and the protein moieties from either bacterial species are active."

https://openalex.org/W2092765135,"Unique loci in the human genome were examined with restriction enzymes in order to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Of 31 arbitrary loci, nine were detectably polymorphic, reflecting ten polymorphic restriction sites. Nine of the ten polymorphic sites were revealed with two restriction enzymes, Msp I and Taq I, whose recognition sequences have in common the dimer sequence CpG. The cytosines in the CpG sequence are known to be frequently methylated in mammals, and the occurrence of significant variation in Msp I and Taq I sites supports the view that methylated cytosine residues are hotspots for mutation in mammalian DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1968911057,"We have localized normal cellular pp60c-src in the developing chick neural retina by immunocytochemical staining using antisera raised against bacterially expressed pp60c-src, the src gene product of Rous sarcoma virus. pp60c-src was expressed in developing retinal neurons at the onset of differentiation. Expression of pp60c-src persisted in mature neuronal cells that were postmitotic, fully differentiated, and functional. pp60c-src immunoreactivity was localized within processes and cell bodies of ganglion neurons, processes of rods and cones, and in some but not all neurons of the inner nuclear layer. Protein kinase assays and Western transfer analyses identified the immunoreactive protein as pp60c-src and confirmed that its expression occurs at the time the first neuronal cells in the retina differentiate. We conclude from these studies that pp60c-src is the product of a developmentally regulated gene that is more important in neuronal differentiation or function than cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2017588515,"Larsen and Weintraub showed that a feature of active (but not inactive) chromatin is the appearance of S1-nuclease-hypersensitive sites in the 5′-flanking regions of expressing genes. Such sites are also present in supercoiled, but not relaxed, plasmids carrying these gene sequences. We have developed an in vitro approach to map, at the nucleotide level, S1-hypersensitive sites in artificially generated supercoiled circles of naked DNA. In the case of the adult chicken β-globin gene, our results correlate extremely well with the coarser in vivo mapping. These sites reside in homopurine-homopyrimidine tracts, and, despite their S1 sensitivity, they do not seem to be single-stranded."
https://openalex.org/W1517725951,"Abstract We recently reported that 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) causes a rapid increase in the translational activity of a specific mRNA (mRNAS14) coding for a protein designated (Mr = 18,000; 4.9 pI) using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of in vitro translated proteins. The current studies suggest that Spot 14 is a cytosolic protein. Using a plasmid-derived cDNAS14 and dot hybridization, we have directly measured changes in hepatic mRNAS14 levels in response to T3 and other physiologic stimuli. Following injection of hypothyroid rats with a receptor-saturating dose of T3, a 20-min lag preceded the induction of hepatic mRNAS14 to levels 16-fold above basal values within 4 h. This is the most rapid effect of T3 on hepatic gene expression documented to date. Both during time course studies in hypothyroid animals injected with T3 as well as in the intact euthyroid rat, hepatic mRNAS14 levels varied up to 3-fold over a 24-h period in a pattern consistent with circadian variation. A lipogenic diet also significantly elevated hepatic mRNAS14. Thus, T3, dietary, and the unknown factors responsible for circadian variation influence hepatic mRNAS14 expression. Blot and dot hybridization analysis indicated that mRNAS14 expression in nonhepatic tissues was significantly below euthyroid hepatic values. Responsivity of mRNAS14 in nonhepatic tissue to in vivo T3 administration was also either substantially diminished or totally absent. Thus, expression and regulation of mRNAS14 is tissue specific."
https://openalex.org/W2063360834,"In the human fetal spinal cord at 15 to 16 weeks, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was demonstrated within the cytoplasm and processes of cells having the cytological, ultrastructural, and immunocytochemical features of oligodendrocytes--including processes that extend into and contribute to the formation of myelin sheaths. By 17 to 18 weeks, however, GFAP immunoreactivity was no longer evident within such cells. Thus GFAP is expressed by myelin-forming oligodendroglia early in their development."
https://openalex.org/W1586291434,"The nucleotide sequence of a human U1 small nuclear RNA gene (HU1-1) is presented, along with several hundred nucleotides of its 5' and 3' flanking regions. We demonstrate that the immediate 5' flanking region sequences are a highly specific hydridization probe capable of distinguishing U1 RNA true genes from pseudogenes. The copy number of U1 RNA genes was determined to be constant, about 30/haploid genome equivalent in six different individuals. Nevertheless, several restriction enzyme cleavage site polymorphisms exist in these genes. We also show that C-C-G-G sequences in the vicinity of U1 RNA true genes are not methylated, but they are methylated near pseudogenes. Genomic DNAs of mouse, frog, chicken, and fruit fly contain sequences homologous to the human U1 RNA gene coding region but not to the 5' flanking region. This suggests that sequences important for expression of U1 RNA genes constitute only a minor part of the 5' flanking regions. In the HU1-1 locus, sequences similar to the consensus T-A-T-A-A-A box are located about 45 and 210 base pairs upstream of the point corresponding to the 5' end of the mature RNA. Several additional direct repeats which may be regulatory elements are present in the upstream region. A few short inverted repeats which probably constitute a transcription termination signal are in the region corresponding to the 3' end of the U1 RNA."

This appears to be the first demonstration of a significant autonomic input to the cerebellum. The projection has a widespread origin and is bilateral with an ipsilateral preponderance.
https://openalex.org/W2012557167,"We have identified a group of RNA molecules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that appears to be equivalent to the U class of small nuclear RNAs previously described in other eucaryotes, resembling them in size, metabolic stability, 5′ cap structure, presence of modified bases, and nuclear localization. However, the yeast snRNAs differ from their counterparts in several potentially important ways. First, they are present in very low abundance, less than 200 copies per cell, as compared to 105–106 for mammalian U1-U6. Second, there appear to be more species in yeast than in any cell type previously examined. Finally, we have cloned five yeast snRNA genes, and find that each is present in a single copy per haploid genome, whereas all previously characterized snRNAs are encoded by multiple (5 to 100) gene copies. The presence of single copy genes in yeast will greatly facilitate the genetic analysis of snRNA function."
https://openalex.org/W2059713553,"We report mutations affecting several steps of CoIE1 primer formation. Primer precursor forms the hybrid with the template DNA and is cleaved by RNAase H to form the primer. Point mutations at positions -264, -265, -268, and -308 (base pairs upstream of the replication origin) reduce efficiency of hybrid formation. A suppressor mutation at -18 increases the efficiency for a mutant transcript and reduces that for a wild-type transcript. Therefore, hybrid formation probably starts after transcription passes this position. A mutation at -10 affects the site of cleavage by RNAase H. The site appears to be determined by the distance from a stem-loop structure immediately upstream. A double mutation at -186 and -188 results in formation of an RNA secondary structure that prevents use of an RNAase H-cleaved transcript as primer."
https://openalex.org/W1528214586,"Monoclonal antibodies, developed against the chick intestinal receptor for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), were characterized with respect to their interaction with this protein and for their effects on the polypeptide's hormone-binding and nuclear-binding functions. Antibodies, internally labeled with [35S]methionine, react directly with hormone-labeled receptor, as identified by comigration of both isotopes during sedimentation on hypertonic 10-30% sucrose gradients. Antibodies bound both the unoccupied and occupied forms of the receptor, the latter with equilibrium dissociation constants of 10(-10)-10(-11) M at 4 degrees C. Excess antibody, added to unoccupied receptors prior to incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3, did not affect the receptor's apparent affinity for the hormone (Kd approximately equal to 6 X 10(-11) M). In contrast, all three antibodies, complexed with occupied receptors, significantly reduced the extent of the receptor's association with isolated nuclei (48-64% inhibition). This inhibition most likely represents a general reduction in the affinity of the protein for nuclei under the conditions tested, since the affinity of the occupied 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor for DNA, as well as the ionic strength necessary to elute receptor from both cation and anion exchange resins was significantly reduced by prior incubation with excess antibody. These findings suggest that the epitopes for each of the three monoclonal antibodies may be located in or near the DNA or nuclear binding domain of the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor. Taken cumulatively, these results indicate that the monoclonal immunoreagents utilized here should prove useful in delineating important biochemical features of this unique sterol hormone receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1480254201,"Guinea pig kidney poly(A+) RNA was translated in reticulocyte lysates and wheat germ extracts. Antibodies to the holoenzyme (Na/K-ATPase) immunoprecipitated only a 96,000-dalton product which was identified as the alpha subunit with a molecular weight that was indistinguishable from that of mature alpha subunit. To explore the possibility that the primary translational product is integrated as such into membranes, guinea pig kidney poly(A+) RNA was translated in reticulocyte lysates in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes; two immunoprecipitated products were detected, the 96,000-dalton alpha subunit and a 135,000-dalton new component that was integrated into the microsomal membrane since it was completely resistant to extraction with alkali. Addition of purified alpha subunit inhibited the binding of antibody to the 135,000-dalton product and extraction with urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate recovered the 96,000-dalton product, implying that the 135,000-dalton product was an alpha-chi dimer. Translation of size-fractionated poly(A+) RNA yielded evidence that the 135,000-dalton product is encoded in two separate mRNAs. The integration in vitro of the alpha subunit is, therefore, dependent on the co-translational integration into the membranes of a smaller peptide (35,000 to 40,000 daltons) which is presumably the beta subunit. Evidence was also obtained that this mechanism is present in vivo by isolation of mRNA alpha from free polysomes, as well as detection of the cytosolic form of the alpha subunit in pulse-chase experiments in MDCK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2118346198,"Chinese hamster ovary cell hybrids were constructed that are heterozygous for two markers, leuS and emtB, linked to the long arm of chromosome 2. In addition, the chromosome 2 carrying the wild-type leuS and emtB alleles contains, on its short arm, a homogeneously staining region (hsr) in which the gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) is amplified approximately 50-fold. This provides a convenient cytogenetic and biochemical means to distinguish the chromosome 2s from the different parents. Analysis of emetine-resistant segregants isolated from such hybrids identified three distinct classes of segregants. One rare class of segregants loses the wild-type leuS and emtB gene functions on the long arm of the hsr chromosome 2 (H-2) but retains the amplified dhfr genes on the opposite arm. Detailed genetic analysis of two such segregants that did not arise by chromosome loss or deletion revealed that new gene linkage relationships had been established on the H-2 chromosome in each, demonstrating that the segregation events in these cell lines involved mitotic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2026748945,"We have cloned a single copy gene that encodes a small nuclear RNA, designated snR3, from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This RNA is highly conserved among fungi, and sequence and secondary structure analyses suggest that snR3 is analogous to mammalian U4 snRNA. To determine whether snR3 has an essential function in yeast, the gene (designated SNR3), was disrupted by replacing 35 nucleotides of coding sequences with 2.2 kb of yeast DNA containing the LEU2 gene. Since cells entirely lacking snR3 were expected to be inviable, the nonfunctional gene was used to replace one chromosomal copy in a diploid cell, and the diploid transformants were sporulated. Surprisingly, virtually all tetrads gave rise to four viable spores. Moreover, these haploid strains, which have been shown by DNA blot hybridization to lack an intact copy of the SNR3 gene, and which contain no detectable snR3 transcripts, are indistinguishable from their SNR3+ sister spores under a variety of growth conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2067564426,Anti-idiotype reagents that recognize a common idiotype associated with antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) were used to induce anti-HBs in mice. The anti-idiotype-induced anti-HBs was found to recognize the group-specific a determinant of hepatitis B surface antigen and to express an interspecies idiotype. These findings suggest that anti-idiotypes may be useful as vaccines or vaccine primers.
https://openalex.org/W2121388946,"The cycle of protein-carboxyl methylation and demethylation was studied in intact blood platelets. Platelets rapidly incorporated L-[methyl-3H]methionine and after a delay of about 20 min, they evolved [3H]methanol. This evolution, and the amount of [3H] methanol liberated by treatment with base, was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, papaverine, dipyridamole, and RA233 (2,6-bis(diethanolamino)-4-piperidinopyrimido[5,4-d] pyrimidine). Each of these compounds increased the incorporation of [3H]methionine into platelets. The effects of RA233 were studied in more detail. Inhibition of [3H]methanol production was not potentiated by stimulators of the adenylate cyclase or the guanylate cyclase. The majority of the base-labile radioactivity was trichloroacetic acid precipitable. Thin layer chromatography of extracts of platelets incubated with L-[35S]methionine showed that RA233 did not induce a cellular accumulation of [35S]S-adenosylhomocysteine, and that it actually increased the amount of cellular [35S]S-adenosylmethionine. Discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at acid pH using the cationic detergent benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecylammonium chloride of platelets incubated with [3H]methionine showed incorporation of radioactivity into more than 30 protein bands, including one which co-migrates with calmodulin. The incorporation into the majority of these bands was inhibited by RA233 in a dose-dependent fashion. It is suggested that caution should be used in ascribing the pharmacological effects of known phosphodiesterase inhibitors to increases in cyclic nucleotides, because some of these effects could be due to inhibition of protein carboxyl methylation."
https://openalex.org/W1971986867,In Sardinia the common form of beta thalassemia is a beta 0 thalassemia due to a nonsense mutation at codon 39. delta beta 0 Thalassemia is rare in Sardinia and is associated with increased production of hemoglobin F of the A gamma type. In this study we used a synthetic oligomer assay and detected the beta 39 nonsense mutation on the delta beta 0 thalassemia chromosome. Hence at least two different mutations have occurred on this chromosome; one that increases A gamma globin synthesis and another that silences the beta globin gene.
https://openalex.org/W2155869902,Synthetic peptides with the sequence of the third hypervariable region of either M104 or J558 murine myeloma proteins have been used to immunize rabbits. Most of the resulting antisera distinguished the two proteins in a specific manner corresponding to the sequence of the immunizing peptide. Thus synthetic peptides have been used to elicit antisera specific for particular idiotypes. These studies have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular basis of idiotypy.

https://openalex.org/W1573595980,"Poly(A+) RNA was prepared from hepatic free polysomes of rats which had been fed di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate for the induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes. This preparation was enriched for the mRNAs of these enzymes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and used for the synthesis of double-stranded cDNA. Recombinant plasmids were constructed from the cDNA and pBR322 by dG X dC-tailing method and used for the transformation of an Escherichia coli strain, chi 1776. By differential colony hybridization using [32P]cDNA of partially purified liver poly(A+) RNA from induced and noninduced rats as probes, and then by hybridization-selected translation, we obtained two clones with cDNA inserts which specifically selected acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA. On Northern blotting, both cDNA inserts hybridized to 3.8-kilobase RNA which was increased about 10-fold by di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate treatment of the rats. The cleavage maps of the cDNA inserts showed they overlap with each other. We conclude that the above two recombinant plasmid clones contain cDNA sequences for rat acyl-CoA oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1537716625,"Further characterization of the free alpha subunit immunoreactive material, not combined with beta subunit in extracts of bovine pituitaries, shows that the only significant modifications, relative to alpha subunits themselves, are the oligosaccharide O-linked to threonine-43, and heterogeneity of the carboxyl terminus. Removal of the O-linked carbohydrate with a mixture of glycosidases from Streptococcus pneumoniae results in an alpha-like material capable of combining with lutropin beta subunit and, thus, the presence of the oligosaccharide is responsible for the inability of the free alpha-like material to combine with beta subunits. Amino acid compositions of tryptic peptides spanning the entire sequence indicate no change in amino acid sequence of the free alpha-like material as compared to lutropin alpha. Further, based on the similar behavior reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography of the tryptic peptides as compared to their lutropin alpha counterparts, it is concluded that no additional post-translational modifications are present. The N-linked oligosaccharides of the free alpha-like material most likely contain terminal O-sulfated N-acetylhexosamines (as do the asparagine-linked carbohydrates from the pituitary hormones) as indicated by the presence of 3 mol of sulfate/mol of free alpha-like material and the resistance of these oligosaccharides to enzymatic deglycosylation. The O-linked oligosaccharide does not contain sulfated residues."
https://openalex.org/W1514321141,"A previously isolated mouse Cl-1D derived cell line (B-1/25) overproduces adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4) by 3200-fold. The present studies were undertaken to determine the molecular basis of this phenomenon. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate and Xenopus oocyte translation studies indicated that the B-1/25 cells also overproduced adenosine deaminase mRNA. Total poly(A+) RNA derived from B-1/25 was used to construct a cDNA library. After prehybridization with excess parental Cl-1D RNA to selectively prehybridize nonamplified sequences, 32P-labeled cDNA probe synthesized from B-1/25 total poly(A+) RNA was used to identify recombinant colonies containing amplified mRNA sequences. Positive clones containing adenosine deaminase gene sequences were identified by blot hybridization analysis and hybridization-selected translation in both rabbit reticulocyte lysate and Xenopus oocyte translation systems. Adenosine deaminase cDNA clones hybridized with three poly(A+) RNA species of 1.5, 1.7, and 5.2 kilobases in length, all of which were overproduced in the B-1/25 cell line. Dot blot hybridization analysis using an adenosine deaminase cDNA clone showed that the elevated adenosine deaminase level in the B-1/25 cells was fully accounted for by an increase in adenosine deaminase gene copy number. The adenosine deaminase cDNA probes and the cell lines with amplified adenosine deaminase genes should prove extremely useful in studying the structure and regulation of the adenosine deaminase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1554082381,"Thyrotropin (TSH), a glycoprotein hormone of the pituitary consisting of two subunits (alpha and beta), regulates thyroxine (T4) production by the thyroid gland. T4, in turn, regulates TSH biosynthesis and release. We have studied the regulation of the messenger RNA encoding the alpha subunit of TSH by T4 in pituitaries and in a transplantable thyrotropic tumor in mice. Hypothyroid male LAF1 mice bearing the TtT 97 thyrotropic tumor were injected daily with T4 for either 0, 1, 5, 12, or 33 days. Levels of TSH and its unassociated alpha (free alpha) and TSH-beta subunits in the plasma of these animals fell to less than 5% of control values after 33 days. Concentrations of TSH and TSH-beta in both tumor and pituitary also fell to low levels (less than 2% of control), while intracellular concentrations of free alpha subunit remained unchanged. Cellular levels of the mRNA encoding the precursor of the alpha subunit or pre-alpha (alpha mRNA) were measured by cell-free translation followed by electrophoretic analysis of immunoprecipitates of pre-alpha subunit and by nucleic acid hybridization to a radiolabeled cDNA probe specific for the alpha mRNA. In the pituitary, translatable and hybridizable alpha mRNA was decreased slightly after 1 day of T4 and decreased 40-50% after 5 and 12 days. In thyrotropic tumors, both translatable and total alpha mRNA showed a 60% decrease by 1 day and a maximum 85% decrease after 5, 12, and 33 days of T4. Therefore, T4 acts rapidly in vivo to decrease steady state alpha mRNA levels in the thyrotrope, and this decrease is maintained for the duration of treatment with thyroid hormone. This regulatory process is reflected in the sharp decreases in levels of TSH and free alpha subunit in plasma and in lower concentrations of the intact TSH in tissue. In contrast, the maintenance of high tissue concentrations of free alpha subunit after T4 treatment may be a reflection of alterations in a post-translational process specific for the free alpha subunit, as opposed to that of the intact TSH."

https://openalex.org/W1503677472,"Rates of de novo and salvage purine synthesis decrease by approximately 80 and 60%, respectively, when normal human lymphoblasts are starved 3 h for an essential amino acid (Boss, G. R., and Erbe, R. W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4242-4247). Amino acid starvation decreased the intracellular phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-Rib-P) and ribose 5-phosphate concentrations by approximately 40%, but neither the specific activities of PP-Rib-P synthetase and glutamine amidophosphoribosyltransferase nor the intracellular concentrations of purine nucleotides and inorganic phosphate changed significantly. In mutant cells with either an increased capacity to generate PP-Rib-P (superactive PP-Rib-P synthetase), or an increased PP-Rib-P concentration (inosinate-guanylate:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency), the intracellular PP-Rib-P concentration decreased by less than 15% during amino acid starvation and de novo purine synthesis decreased significantly less than in normal cells. When normal cells were treated with drugs that simultaneously decreased feed-back inhibition by purine nucleotides and increased the intracellular concentration of ribose 5-phosphate and PP-Rib-P rates of de novo purine synthesis were stimulated 3-fold in nonstarved cells and more than 8-fold in starved cells. This greater stimulation in the starved cells appeared to be from the increased PP-Rib-P production; moreover, in starved cells in which the increase of the PP-Rib-P concentration by the drugs was impaired because of purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, rates of de novo purine synthesis increased only 3.5-fold. The data suggest that amino acid starvation decreases purine synthesis by decreasing the generation of PP-Rib-P from glucose."

https://openalex.org/W2103334728,"The function of the qa-1F positive regulatory gene of Neurospora has been studied by mapping the initiation sites for transcription of the clustered qa structural genes in wild type, in qa-1F mutants, and in cis-acting activator protein-independent mutants of qa-2 (qa-2ai mutants). Each structural gene under qa-1F control has two to four promoters. The qa-2ai mutations, which include point mutations and small (68-84 bp) duplications 5' to qa-2, allow qa-1F-independent transcription from surrounding qa promoters independently of the orientations and positions (up-stream or downstream) of teh mutations relative to the promoters. However, one subset of promoters was not reactivated by the enhancer-like elements created by these mutations, and qa-1F mutants selectively deficient in the activation of these promoters have been identified. Therefore, the qa-1F regulatory gene appears to control two types of promoters that have different requirements for activation."
https://openalex.org/W1496971376,"We have previously identified a number of cloned poly(A)+ RNA sequences in a cDNA library, each of whose expression is markedly altered in a dimethylhydrazine-induced mouse colon tumor as compared to the normal colon. Transcripts which hybridize to one of the cloned cDNAs, pMCT-1, have now been shown to be elevated in expression in three mouse leukemia cell lines as well, and induction of differentiation in one of these lines (DS-19) is associated with a substantial decrease in expression of these transcripts. By hybridization and sequence analysis, pMCT-1 has been found to contain a region homologous to a long terminal repeat of an intracisternal A particle sequence. Intracisternal A sequences are endogenous, retroviral genomes repeated several thousandfold and dispersed in the mouse genome. The data show that the transcripts which are homologous to this long terminal repeat are highly heterogeneous, suggesting that many intracisternal type A particle transcriptional units may be expressed in the colon tumor and leukemia cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1619816318,"As a first step in studying the biosynthesis of the peptide hormone calcitonin, we have identified procalcitonin species in CA-77 cells, a newly developed rat medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line. mRNA extracted from the cells directed the synthesis of a putative procalcitonin in a reticulocyte lysate translation system containing microsomal membranes. Both this species and a radiolabeled form of immunoreactive calcitonin from intact cells had the same retention time during reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The putative cellular procalcitonin was also immunoprecipitated by antiserum to a synthetic peptide whose sequence constitutes the COOH-terminal 16 residues of preprocalcitonin. The polypeptide had a Mr = 13,400, as estimated by gel filtration chromatography under denaturing conditions. Microsequencing of the [35S]methionine-labeled polypeptide indicated that residues 13, 32, and 34 of procalcitonin were methionine. Similar analysis of the peptide labeled with [3H]proline indicated that residues 2 and 11 of the precursor were proline. The positions of methionine and proline could be aligned in a unique manner with the NH2-terminal half of the preprocalcitonin sequence inferred from cDNA analyses. These results indicate that procalcitonin consists of 111 amino acids and suggest that a 25-residue signal sequence is cotranslationally cleaved from preprocalcitonin. From the procalcitonin sequence we can now predict the sequence of likely biosynthetic intermediates and mature secretory products derived from the NH2-terminal as well as COOH-terminal regions of the precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1576099607,"The effect of reovirus double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and 5'-O-monophosphate form of 2',5'-oligoadenylate (pA(2'p5'A)2) on the translation and degradation of reovirus messenger RNA and on protein phosphorylation was examined in extracts prepared from interferon-treated mouse L fibroblasts. The following results were obtained. 1) The enhanced degradation of reovirus [3H]mRNA observed in the presence of either dsRNA or the 5'-O-triphosphate form of 2',5'-oligoadenylate (pppA(2'p5'A)3) was completely blocked by pA(2'p5'A)2. 2) The dsRNA-dependent phosphorylation of protein P1 and the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF-2) depended in a similar manner upon the concentration of dsRNA and was optimal at low dsRNA concentrations (0.1 to 1 microgram/ml). However, high concentrations of dsRNA (greater than 100 micrograms/ml) drastically reduced the phosphorylation of both P1 and eIF-2 alpha. Neither P1 nor eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation was affected by either pA(2'p5'A)2 or pppA(2'p5'A)3. 3) The translation of reovirus mRNA in vitro was inhibited by the addition of either low concentrations of dsRNA or pppA(2'p5'A)3. Whereas pA(2'p5'A)2 completely reversed the pppA(2'p5'A)3-mediated inhibition of translation, the inhibition mediated by low concentrations of dsRNA was only partially reversed by pA(2'p5'A)2. Under conditions where the pppA-(2'p5'A)3mediated degradation of reovirus mRNA was blocked, the translation of reovirus mRNA was still inhibited by low but not by high concentrations of dsRNA in a manner that correlated with the activation of P1 and eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation. These results suggest that the pppA(2'p5'A)n-dependent ribonuclease is not required and that protein phosphorylation may indeed be sufficient for the dsRNA-dependent inhibition of reovirus mRNA translation in cell-free systems derived from interferon-treated mouse fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1517768963,"The W8 cell line, a chemically transformed variant of K16 rat liver epithelial cells, does not produce a normal type I collagen but instead secretes alpha 1(I) trimer and no alpha 2(I) chains (Smith, B.D., and Niles, R.

Analysis of total cellular RNA from the K16 and W8 cells by cell-free translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate demonstrates the specific absence of translatable pro-alpha 2(I) collagen mRNA. No alpha 2(I) collagen mRNA sequences were detected by Northern hybridization analysis using cloned rat alpha 2(I) cDNAs as a probe. The total amount of alpha 1(I) collagen mRNAs, however, was the same in both cell types, suggesting a lack of coordinate control of alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) mRNAs in the transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1505808519,"The murine Leydig tumor cell line, MLTC-1, has specific cell surface receptors for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which are coupled to adenylate cyclase. When the cells were exposed to hCG, there was a loss of these receptors (down-regulation), which was both dose- and time-dependent. Down-regulation was inhibited by lowering the temperature, removing bound hormone or blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide. Down-regulation was found to be a biphasic event. The initial phase was dependent upon the binding of hormone and had a half-time of approximately 3 h. The second phase occurred around 8 h after exposing the cells to the hormone and was apparently independent of bound hCG. It was related to increases in cyclic AMP since it could be mimicked by incubating the cells with choleragen or dibutyryl cyclic AMP and isobutylmethylxanthine. The reappearance of hormone receptors began approximately 24-32 h after the initial exposure to hCG and was complete within 48 h. Adenylate cyclase activity in membranes from control and down-regulated cells responded equally well to Mn2+ and NaF indicating that neither the catalytic or regulatory component (G/F) of the adenylate cyclase system had been lost during downregulation. Cholate extracts of control and down-regulated cells also were equally effective at reconstituting isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in S49 cyc-membranes (which lack a functional G/F). Thus, down-regulation did not impair the ability of G/F to couple receptors to the catalytic component of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1568697032,"In interferon-treated mouse L cells, following infection with a DNA-containing virus, vaccinia, synthesis of unique 2'-5'-linked oligonucleotides of the general formula ppp5'A2'(p5'A)n, abbreviated as 2-5A, was detected by competition radiobinding assay. In addition, degradation of rRNA into discrete and characteristic products, similar to those produced by 2-5A-activated endonuclease, was observed. The degradation of rRNA may represent a significant component of antiviral action of interferon in vaccinia virus-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577402577,"We have investigated the specific DNA and RNA requirements for rho-dependent transcription termination in vitro. As a model, we have used templates containing the rho-dependent terminator of the Escherichia coli trp operon, trp t'. Templates containing the trp t' region direct specific rho-dependent termination in vitro, with concomitant stimulation of the rho NTPase activity, and deletion of the trp t' region results in templates that do not induce rho-dependent termination or rho NTPase activity. Addition of ribonuclease T1 to transcription reactions specifically eliminated transcription termination and rho NTPase activity. These results demonstrate the requirement for a specific RNA component within the trp t' transcript necessary for NTPase activation and rho-dependent transcription termination. Active transcription is not a prerequisite for rho NTPase activation; trp t' RNA (rho-terminated transcripts) and read-through transcripts, which contain the trp t' region, activated the rho NTPase when rho was added after inhibition of transcription. As is true for synthetic polynucleotides known to activate the rho NTPase, the trp t' region has few G residues. This reduces the potential for the formation of stable secondary structures in the RNA transcript, and may be one determinant of sites specifying rho-dependent termination of transcription. The implications of this are discussed in the light of the lack of significant sequence homologies between rho-dependent transcription termination sites."
https://openalex.org/W1596670593,"Swainsonine, an alpha-mannosidase inhibitor found in the Australian plant Swainsona canescens and in spotted locoweed, was tested for its effect on the degradation of endocytosed proteins in rat liver cells. The compound inhibited the release of proteolytically derived breakdown products from endocytosed glycoproteins but not from nonglycoproteins. Fifty per cent inhibition of the degradation of 125I-asialofetuin occurred at a concentration of swainsonine in the medium of 6 X 10(-7) M. In the presence of the inhibitor, there was an increased cellular accumulation of the glycoproteins corresponding quantitatively to the decreased degradation, so that total uptake was the same in the presence or absence of the inhibitor. The excess 125I-labeled material which accumulated within cells under these conditions was found entirely in the lysosomal peak on Percoll density gradient centrifugation and migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a mobility indistinguishable from that of the original material. Thus, the inhibition of breakdown occurs prior to any conversion of the protein to intermediates of detectably smaller size. In contrast to the results with swainsonine, degradation of both glycoproteins and nonglycoproteins was inhibited by chloroquine and by 3-methyladenine. The findings with 3-methyladenine are in conflict with earlier reports in the literature on the effect of this compound on degradation of endocytosed proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2168741417,"Regulation of dolichyl phosphate-linked oligosaccharide assembly has been studied during the course of diethylstilbestrol-induced chick oviduct differentiation. Oviduct membranes from treated chicks form 4.6 times as much GlcNAc-P-P-Dol and GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol upon incubation with UDP-[14C]GlcNAc and MgCl2 than do membranes from untreated chicks. Assembly of oligosaccharide-lipid was studied by incubation of membranes with purified exogenous [14C]GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol and GDP-Man. Man transfer required a divalent cation (10 mM Mg2+) and detergent (0.5% Nonidet P-40 is optimal) and occurs in the presence of amphomycin (500 micrograms/ml). The apparent Km for GDP-Man is 1 microM and for [14C]GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol is 0.45 microM. The products are a series of sequentially formed dolichyl pyrophosphate-linked saccharides up to Man5GlcNAc2, the first of which is Man beta 1,4GlcNAc2. The same products are formed either in the presence or absence of amphomycin. Conversion of GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol to higher oligosaccharides is stimulated 3-fold by estrogen treatment of chicks. Similarly, the conversion of partially purified exogenously added Man beta-[14C]GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol is 4.6-fold higher after diethylstilbestrol treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1501158542,"Class III transcription components were fractionated from Drosophila Kc cells. By the use of successive DEAE-Sephadex and CM-Sepharose column chromatographies, two fractions were identified to contain distinct positive transcription components. The reconstitution of these two fractions and RNA polymerase III was essential for faithful in vitro transcription of cloned Drosophila tRNA and 5 S RNA genes. Further chromatography of one of these fractions using phosphocellulose and DEAE-cellulose did not separate additional components required for reconstitution of transcription. These fractions may contain generalized class III transcription factors, as suggested by the cofractionation of required tRNA and 5 S RNA transcription components. We present further evidence that tRNA and 5 S RNA genes share at least one common transcription component other than RNA polymerase III by the use of stable transcription complex formation and competition experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1566169309,"The ADP/ATP translocator was selectively labeled with the triplet probe eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) after pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide in beef heart mitochondria, as reported previously for submitochondrial particles (Muller, M., Krebs, J. J. R., Cherry, R. J., and Kawato, S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 1117-1120). The EMA binding was completely inhibited by carboxyatractylate. 0.7-1.1 molecules of EMA conjugated with 1 molecule of the dimeric translocator with Mr approximately 65,000. The EMA binding decreased [14C]ADP uptake by about approximately 25%. The EMA-labeled translocator bongkrekate complex was purified and reconstituted in liposomes by removing Triton X-100 with Amberlite XAD-2. The liposomes were composed of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine/cardiolipin and the lipid to protein ratio by weight was (L/P) = 60. Rotational diffusion of the ADP/ATP translocator around the membrane normal was measured in reconstituted proteoliposomes and in the mitochondrial inner membranes by observing the flash-induced absorption anisotropy, r(t), of EMA. In proteoliposomes with L/P = 60, the translocator was rotating with an approximate average rotational relaxation time of phi congruent to 246 microseconds and a normalized time-independent anisotrophy [r3/rr(0)]min congruent to 0.55. In intact mitochondria, values of phi congruent to 405 microseconds and r3/rr(0) congruent to 0.79 were obtained. The higher value of r3/rr(0) in mitochondria compared with proteoliposomes indicates the co-existence of rotating and immobile translocator (phi greater than 20 ms) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Based on the assumption that all the translocator is rotating in the lipid-rich proteoliposomes, the population of the mobile translocator at 20 degrees C was calculated to be approximately 47%. By removing the outer membrane, the mobile population was increased to approximately 70% in mitoplasts, while approximately 53% of the translocator was rotating in submitochondrial particles. The above results indicate a significant difference in protein-protein interactions of the ADP/ATP translocator in the different types of inner membranes of mitochondria. The immobile population of the translocator could be due to nonspecific protein aggregates caused by the very high concentration of proteins in the inner membrane of mitochondria (L/P approximately 0.4)."
https://openalex.org/W1495455676,"The formation and structural characteristics of the human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M)-thrombin complex were studied by intrinsic protein fluorescence, sulfhydryl group titration, electrophoresis in denaturing and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel systems, and in macromolecular inhibitor assays. The interaction between alpha 2M and thrombin was also assessed by comparison of sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoretic patterns of peptides produced by Staphylococcus aureus V-8 proteinase digests of denatured alpha 2M-125I-thrombin and alpha 2M-125I-trypsin complexes. In experiments measuring fluorescence changes and sulfhydryl group exposure caused by methylamine, we found that thrombin produced its maximum effects at a mole ratio of approximately 1.3:1 (thrombin:alpha 2M). Measurements of the ability of alpha 2M to bind trypsin after prior reaction with thrombin indicated that thrombin binds rapidly at one site on alpha 2M, but occupies the second site with some difficulty. Intrinsic fluorescence studies of trypsin binding to alpha 2M at pH 5.0, 6.5, and 8.0 not only revealed striking differences in trypsin's behavior over this pH range, but also some similarities between the behavior of thrombin and trypsin not heretofore recognized. Structural studies, using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to measure alpha 2M-125I-thrombin covalent complex formation, indicated that covalency reached a maximum at a mole ratio of approximately 1.5:1. At this ratio, only 1 mol of thrombin is bound covalently per mol of alpha 2M. These gel studies and those of proteolytic digests of denatured alpha 2M-125I-trypsin and alpha 2M-125I-thrombin complexes suggest that proteinases form covalent bonds with uncleaved alpha 2M subunits. The sum of our results is consistent with a mechanism of proteinase binding to alpha 2M in which the affinity of the proteinase for alpha 2M during an initial reversible interaction determines its binding ratio to the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1508826182,"Using three cloned DNA fragments from a 6.4-kb (kilobase pair) DNA element repeated several thousand times in the human genome (Adams, J. W., Kaufman, R. E., Kretschmer, P. J., Harrison, M. and Nienhuis, A. W. (1980) Nucleic Acids Res. 8, 6113-6128) and DNA/RNA hybridization, we show that transcripts homologous to this DNA family exist in total cellular RNA from human blood cells and from a mouse-human hybrid cell line with one human chromosome, the X. No such transcripts were detected in RNA from rabbit blood or a mouse cell line. For each DNA fragment studied, we found that blood transcripts and X-chromosome transcripts were indistinguishable in electrophoretic mobility and very heterogeneous in length; in addition, prominent hybridization bands were seen at 4.7 and 1.9 kb. Transcription from this DNA family likely occurs from heterogeneous templates. The existence of RNAs smaller than 6.4 kb suggests that part of the repeat unit can be transcribed and/or there exists a cellular mechanism to make these short RNAs from longer precursors. The vast majority of the RNAs homologous to the long repeat are not polyadenylated. In blood RNA there are a few hundred copies of beta-globin mRNA for every transcript homologous to this 6.4 kb repeat."

One antibody was used to characterize one particular antigen by immunoblot analysis. The antigen had a molecular weight of 56,000 was oocyte-specific, and decreased in amount during oogenesis. The antigen was localized in the cytoplasm throughout oogenesis and sedimented mainly at 40-60 S. The antigen also was shown to bind poly(A) RNA following chromatography of ribonucleoprotein particles on oligo(dT)-cellulose. The antibody was used to immunoadsorb nontranslating ribonucleoprotein particles. Fifty-five per cent of the poly(A) RNA sedimenting between 40-60 S was shown to be bound by the antigen. The further use of this antibody in attempting to examine other components of the ribonucleoprotein particle is discussed."

Analyses of fractions for protein content and for protein kinase activity indicated that the major peak of kinase activity did not correspond exactly with any of the VSV-specific proteins. Neither anti-NS nor anti-M IgG preparations inhibited protein kinase activity, and IgG did not act as an exogenous phosphate acceptor. Reconstitution of an RNP-enzyme complex did not result in a restoration of protein kinase activity. In vitro translation of VSV-specific poly(A)-containing RNA did not result in any detectable production of kinase activity. Thus, the major RNP-associated kinase is a host cell protein which is tightly bound to the RNP particle."

https://openalex.org/W1491840503,"Abstract IgG anti-hapten antibodies were purified from the sera of rabbits homozygous for allotypic determinants d11 and d12 in the constant region of the heavy chain. Correlative with this determinant is the absence (d11) or presence (d12) of an oligosaccharide chain just below the hinge region of the IgG molecule. Both d11 and d12 molecules contain a complex heterosaccharide chain located near the carboxyl terminus of the second constant region domain. The two populations of IgG antibodies were thus selectively labeled with the spin probe Tempamine in their second constant region domains by reductive amination primarily of terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid residues. Chemical and enzymatic cleavages showed about 80% of the attached spin labels were N-acetylneuraminic acid-associated. Analysis of probe adducts by ESR spectrometry showed the presence of slower and faster moving subcomponents. Formation of immune complexes by antigen induces slight but significant restrictions of spin label mobility for both d11 and d12 IgG molecules. This restriction is qualitatively different from that seen in glutaraldehyde-, carbodiimide-, or ethanol-induced aggregates of the same IgG antibodies. The addition of purified complement C1 subcomponent C1q to immune aggregates resulted in marked immobilization of spin labels, the rotational correlation time of which was 30-40 mu s for both d11 and d12 molecules (evaluated by saturation transfer spectroscopy). A similar spin probe immobilizing effect is not seen when C1q binds to chemically aggregated IgG antibodies (which also do not activate C1). A novel model is proposed in which C1q is hypothesized to juxtapose Fc moieties in a discrete fashion required for subsequent C1 activation processes mediated by immune complexes."
