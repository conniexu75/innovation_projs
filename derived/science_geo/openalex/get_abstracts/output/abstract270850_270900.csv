https://openalex.org/W1963601589,"The bithorax complex in Drosophila melanogaster is a cluster of homeotic genes that specify developmental pathways for many of the body segments of the fly. The DNA of the bithorax complex has been isolated, and a region of 195,000 base pairs that covers the left half of the complex is described here. The lesions associated with many of the bithorax complex mutants have been identified, and most are due to DNA rearrangements. Most of the spontaneous mutants have insertions of a particular mobile element named ""gypsy."" This element affects the functions of sequences removed from the site of insertion. Mutant lesions for a given phenotypic class are distributed over large DNA distances of up to 73,000 base pairs."

https://openalex.org/W2023869286,"Early dormancy involves a number of phenomena: cessation of active growth, formation of terminal buds, formation of abscission layers in leaves, development of cold resistance, development of winter rest (a chilling requirement), and leaf fall. The buds of some tree species (or some races of a species) have a true rest or winter chilling requirement; usually the roots do not; perhaps the cambium does not. There is a wide range of genetic variation within and between species in response to photoperiod, winter chilling, water nutrients, and other environmental factors which affect the dormancy condition of plants. During the period of winter rest there are many metabolic and developmental processes going on in the buds and twigs. These processes include respiration, photosynthesis, some cell division, enzyme synthesis, production of growth stimulators, and dissipation of growth inhibitors. Dormancy of trees can be divided arbitrarily into three phases: early rest, winter rest, and after-rest. Each of these phases is marked by a distinct set of physiological processes. The transition between the three phases is gradual. Some processes of after-rest can proceed even though the winter chilling requirement (winter rest) of a tree has not been completed fully. Evidence from grafting experiments and chemical treatments to break winter rest, and studies of genetic variability indicate that the processes and phenomena of dormancy are at least partially independent of each other. Different buds and branches and other parts of the same plant may initiate dormancy, break dormancy, and renew vegetative growth independently. Initiation and cessation of dormancy can be triggered by a number of environmental variables: photoperiod, temperature, nutrition, water, an array of chemicals, and shock treatments. Dormancy regulation must either involve a variety of receptors or involve receptors that are responsive to a variety of stimuli. Unless dormancy is defined in a highly restricted sense (that is, possession of chilling requirement), it is hard to conceive of a single receptor or regulator that controls all of the phenomena of dormancy. A large number of genes are definitely involved and hence a large number of enzymes. The kinds of enzymes, their numbers, and their concentrations can be regulated by manipulating the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1823404760,"Crabs grown experimentally on fully shelled prey developed larger and stronger claws than those raised on nutritionally equivalent unshelled prey. When one claw was immobilized, claws also became asymmetrical. These use-induced changes differ from skeletal remodelling in vertebrates and many invertebrates because changes in the rigid exoskeleton can occur only after molting, and claw muscle mass must be reduced substantially before the molt. Such short-term adaptive responses to environmental stimuli, if heritable, could yield long-term evolutionary changes in claw size and, if combined with behavioral biases toward one side (handedness), could also promote the evolution of claw dimorphism."
https://openalex.org/W1982024474,"Oxygen isotope records of cores from the central Arctic Ocean yield evidence for a major influx of meltwater at the beginning of the last deglaciation 15.7 thousand years ago (16,650 calendar years B.C.). The almost parallel trends of the isotope records from the Arctic Ocean, the Fram Strait, and the east Greenland continental margin suggest contemporaneous variations of the Eurasian Arctic and Greenland (Laurentide) ice sheets or increased export of low-saline waters from the Arctic within the East Greenland Current during the last deglaciation. On the basis of isotope and carbon data, the modern surface- and deep-water characteristics and seasonally open-ice conditions with increased surface-water productivity were established in the central Arctic at the end of Termination lb about 7.2 thousand years ago or 6,000 calendar years B.C.)."

https://openalex.org/W2110616968,"Amorphous ice prepared under a wide range of conditions has a density, determined from its buoyancy in liquid oxygen, of 0.94+/-0.02 gram per cubic centimeter, the same as that of ordinary hexagonal ice, with no indication of the glassy superdense ice (2.32 grams per cubic centimeter) reported recently. The diffuse reflectivity shows a small increase as the ice crystallizes at 153 degrees K. This increase is followed by a much larger increase (probably associated with crystal growth) as the sample warms, and the reflectivity reaches a maximum well below the melting temperature. Although the ice deposits appear translucent, the specular reflectivity is low, thus indicating a dull rather than a glassy surface."
https://openalex.org/W2093381153,Geologic and palynological evidence for rapid sea level change approximately 3400 and approximately 2000 carbon-14 years ago (3600 and 1900 calendar years ago) has been found at sites up to 110 kilometers apart in southwestern British Columbia. Submergence on southern Vancouver Island and slight emergence on the mainland during the older event are consistent with a great (magnitude M >/= 8) earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone. The younger event is characterized by submergence throughout the region and may also record a plate-boundary earthquake or a very large crustal or intraplate earthquake. Microfossil analysis can detect small amounts of coseismic uplift and subsidence that leave little or no lithostratigraphic signature.
https://openalex.org/W2063384044,"Ten years of monitoring microearthquakes with a regional seismic network has revealed the presence of a well-defined, linear zone of seismic activity in eastern Tennessee. This zone produced the second highest release of seismic strain energy in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains during the last decade, when normalized by crustal area. The data indicate that seismicity produced by regional, intraplate stresses is now concentrating near the boundary between relatively strong and weak basement crustal blocks."

Before uranyl enters the protoplast, the plasmalemma is greatly dilated. After uranyl is sequestered in vacuoles, the tonoplast is similarly dilated."

https://openalex.org/W2036461373,"During the past year we have studied the effects of various drugs on synaptic transmission in the crayfish; the results will be described elsewhere. In the course of this investigation many drugs were found to have no effect. In such cases a check was made on the preparation by applying a dose of nicotine (10^(-5) grams/cc.) 10 minutes after the original drug. Control tests had shown that nicotine in this concentration blocks transmission in 1-2 minutes. As expected, the presence of most drugs did not influence this action. With some, however, either the nicotine was without effect or the block was greatly delayed. Evidently under certain conditions the preparation is protected against the action of nicotine. Since this situation seems to be of considerable interest, the following preliminary report is presented at this time."
