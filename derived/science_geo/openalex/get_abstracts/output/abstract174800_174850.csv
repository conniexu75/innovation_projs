https://openalex.org/W1983890824,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated within the cell in response to multiple stresses that increase the intracellular AMP:ATP ratio. Here we show that incubation of muscle cells with the thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone, leads to a dramatic increase in this ratio with the concomitant activation of AMPK. This finding raises the possibility that a number of the beneficial effects of the thiazolidinediones could be mediated via activation of AMPK. Furthermore, we show that in addition to the classical activation pathway, AMPK can also be stimulated without changing the levels of adenine nucleotides. In muscle cells, both hyperosmotic stress and the anti-diabetic agent, metformin, activate AMPK in the absence of any increase in the AMP:ATP ratio. However, although activation is no longer dependent on this ratio, it still involves increased phosphorylation of threonine 172 within the catalytic (alpha) subunit. AMPK stimulation in response to hyperosmotic stress does not appear to involve phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase, or p38 MAP kinase alpha or beta. Our results demonstrate that AMPK can be activated by at least two distinct signaling mechanisms and suggest that it may play a wider role in the cellular stress response than was previously understood."
https://openalex.org/W2048005397,"Aberrant hypermethylation of gene promoters is a major mechanism associated with inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes in cancer. We previously showed this transcriptional silencing to be mediated by both methylation and histone deacetylase activity, with methylation being dominant. Here, we have used cDNA microarray analysis to screen for genes that are epigenetically silenced in human colorectal cancer. By screening over 10,000 genes, we show that our approach can identify a substantial number of genes with promoter hypermethylation in a given cancer; these are distinct from genes with unmethylated promoters, for which increased expression is produced by histone deacetylase inhibition alone. Many of the hypermethylated genes we identified have high potential for roles in tumorigenesis by virtue of their predicted function and chromosome position.We also identified a group of genes that are preferentially hypermethylated in colorectal cancer and gastric cancer. One of these genes, SFRP1, belongs to a gene family; we show that hypermethylation of four genes in this family occurs very frequently in colorectal cancer, providing for (i) a unique potential mechanism for loss of tumor-suppressor gene function and (ii) construction of a molecular marker panel that could detect virtually all colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2083849298,"Abstract AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is viewed as an energy sensor that acts to modulate glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Given that protein synthesis is a high energy-consuming process, it may be transiently depressed during cellular energy stress. Thus, the intent of this investigation was to examine whether AMPK activation modulates the translational control of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle. Injections of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribonucleoside (AICAR) were used to activate AMPK in male rats. The activity of α1 AMPK remained unchanged in gastrocnemius muscle from AICAR-treated animals compared with controls, whereas α2AMPK activity was significantly increased (51%). AICAR treatment resulted in a reduction in protein synthesis to 45% of the control value. This depression was associated with decreased activation of protein kinases in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway as evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B on Ser473, mTOR on Ser2448, ribosomal protein S6 kinase on Thr389, and eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein on Thr37. A reduction in eIF4E associated with eIF4G to 10% of the control value was also noted. In contrast, eIF2B activity remained unchanged in response to AICAR treatment and therefore would not appear to contribute to the depression in protein synthesis. This is the first investigation to demonstrate changes in translation initiation and skeletal muscle protein synthesis in response to AMPK activation."

https://openalex.org/W2076075378,"This study describes a method for the identification of the substrates of specific serine kinases. An antibody specific for the phosphomotif generated by the kinase is used to isolate phosphorylated substrates by immunoprecipitation, and the isolated proteins are identified by tandem mass spectrometry of peptides. This method was applied to the identification of substrates for the protein kinase Akt, which specifically phosphorylates the RXRXXS/T motif. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with insulin to activate Akt, and the putative Akt substrate proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against the phospho form of this motif. This led to the identification of a novel 160-kDa substrate for Akt. The 160-kDa substrate for Akt, which was designated AS160, has a Rab GAP domain. Recombinant AS160 was shown to be a substrate for Akt, and two sites of phosphorylation, both in RXRXXS/T motifs, were identified by mass spectrometry and mutation. Insulin treatment of adipocytes caused AS160 to redistribute from the low density microsomes to the cytosol.

GTPase-activating protein low density microsomes tandem mass spectrometry phosphoprotein phosphotyrosine binding octaethyleneglycol dodecyl ether phosphatidylinositol 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Protein phosphorylation is a key cellular regulatory mechanism. The human genome contains ∼1000 kinases. A major issue is to identify the protein substrates for each kinase. A number of different approaches have been developed (reviewed in Ref. 1Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These include:in vitro phosphorylation of cell homogenates with recombinant kinases, screening of expression libraries with recombinant kinases, searching for kinase interacting proteins by the yeast two-hybrid screen, and the generation of mutated kinases that can function only with an ATP derivative. Each of these methods has its advantages and limitations, and additional methods are needed. Each serine kinase typically phosphorylates Ser/Thr within a particular motif, and for many kinases the motif has been defined through identification of the sites of phosphorylation on substrate proteins and on peptide libraries (2Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Phosphospecific antibodies against the phosphorylated form of these motifs are available or can be generated. Thus, immunoprecipitation with these antibodies, when combined with tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides, offers an approach for the isolation and identification of substrates for specific serine kinases. In the past this approach has been used for the identification of substrates for tyrosine kinases through the use of antibodies against phosphotyrosine, but to our knowledge it has not previously been used with serine kinases. In the present study, we applied this method to find substrates for the protein kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B), which specifically phosphorylates Ser or Thr in the motif RXRXXS/T (3Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have employed 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a cell type in which Akt is rapidly activated by insulin treatment (4Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This method has led to the isolation of a novel target for Akt that contains a Rab GAP1 domain and two PTB domains. A key reagent for this study is the antibody for the Akt phosphomotif RXRXXpS/T, whereX is any amino acid. This antibody, which is referred as the PAS antibody (phospho Aktsubstrate), was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA (catalog number 9611). It is an affinity-purified rabbit antibody that has been shown to react specifically with the Akt phosphomotif in 12 known Akt substrates (literature from Cell Signaling Technology). The method used to generate the antibody is not described, but presumably an antiserum with this specificity could be generated by immunization with a mixture of phosphopeptides in which all amino acids except Cys were put into the X positions, and the antibody could be affinity-purified on the immobilized mixture of phosphopeptides. An affinity-purified antibody against the carboxyl terminal 12 amino acids of mouse AS160 (PTNDKAKAGNKP) was generated as described in Ref. 5Lampere L. Lienhard G.E. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2196-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. Antibody against the FLAG tag (catalog number F-3165) was purchased from Sigma. The cDNA encoding AS160 (6Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) in pBluescript SK vector was kindly provided by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. It was amplified by PCR with a 5′ primer containing a NotI site and a 3′ primer with a BamHI site and then spliced into the p3XFLAG-CMV-10 vector (Sigma). This yielded AS160 with a triple FLAG tag at the amino terminus. Mutants of AS160 in the p3XFLAG-CMV-10 vector were generated by PCR using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, and the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were carried as fibroblasts and differentiated as described (7Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h before use and were then treated with 160 nm insulin for 10 min, unless stated otherwise. COS7L cells, purchased from Invitrogen, were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA/10-cm plate with the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For isolation of the proteins with the PAS antibody, 10-cm plates of adipocytes were each treated with insulin or not, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in 0.6 ml of 4% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with protease inhibitors (10 μm concentration each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and EP475) at 100 °C for 5 min. The SDS lysate was treated with 25 mm N-ethylmaleimide to cap the thiol groups and diluted with 5 ml of 1.7% thesit, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min, and the infranatant was passed through a 0.45-micron filter to remove residual triglyceride droplets. PAS antibody (7 μg per plate) was added, and after 2 h the immunoprecipitate was collected on protein A-Sepharose (10 μl per plate) for 2 h. The beads were washed four times with 0.5% thesit, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and the immunoprecipitates were solubilized in SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min. For immunoblotting proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to electrophoretically to Immobilon-P (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, treated with primary antibody in the same solution, washed, treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and developed with the chemiluminescence reagent Supersignal (Pierce). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with the colloidal Coomassie Blue reagent (Invitrogen). Proteins of interest were digested in gel with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were sequenced by microcapillary liquid chromatography MS/MS on an ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan LCDQ DECA XP), as described (8Wu X. Ranganathan V. Weisman D.S. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N. O'Neill T.B. Crick K.E. Pierce K.A. Lane W.S. Rathbun G. Livingston D.M. Weaver D.T. Nature. 2000; 405: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). To detect a specific site of phosphorylation, a targeted ion MS/MS experiment was conducted for each putative phosphopeptide. In these experiments the predicted precursor mass-to-charge ratio of the phosphopeptide was subjected to MS/MS for the entire chromatographic run. This procedure significantly increases detection sensitivity by capturing only the peptide of interest at the moment of its chromatographic elution while excluding peptidic background. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were untreated or treated with rapamcyin, wortmannin, or LY294002 and then subsequently exposed to insulin or not. Rapamycin inhibits insulin activation of the 70-kDa S6 kinase but not of Akt, whereas wortmannin and LY294002 inhibit activation of PI 3-kinase and thereby of Akt (9Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Somwar R. Niu W. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Randhawa V.K. Huang C. Ramlal T. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46079-46087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). SDS samples of the cells were blotted with the PAS antibody (Fig.1 A). Seven insulin-elicited phosphoproteins (pp250, pp160, pp105, pp75, pp47, pp43, and pp32) were detected. Wortmannin and LY294004 blocked the phosphorylation of all of these except possibly pp75, but rapamycin blocked only the phosphorylation of pp32. These results thus suggested that pp250, pp160, pp105, pp47, and pp43 are Akt substrates, whereas pp32 may be an S6 kinase substrate. Insulin also caused a decrease in the phosphorylation of a 60-kDa protein, which was blocked by wortmannin and LY294004, but not by rapamycin. In Fig. 1 A insulin treatment was for 10 min. Examination of the time course for changes in phosphorylation detected with the PAS antibody showed that for each phosphoprotein the change was approximately maximal after 10 min of insulin treatment (data not shown). To isolate the proteins that underwent changes in phosphorylation, we carried out immunoprecipitation with the PAS antibody. Cells were first lysed in SDS to denature the proteins and thereby expose the phosphopeptide motifs, and then an excess of nonionic detergent was added and the immunoprecipitation performed. By this approach it was possible to isolate pp250, pp160, pp105, pp75, and pp60 (Fig.1 B). No pp32 was detected in the immunoprecipitate, and the strong signal from the antibody heavy chain precluded determining whether pp47 and pp43 were present. The immunoprecipitate derived from insulin-treated cells showed slightly more of the pp250, pp160, pp105, and pp75 than did that derived from untreated cells. However, the difference was not as large as was observed with blotting of the cell lysates (Fig. 1 A). A possible explanation is that the PAS antibody, which is a mixture, contains only a limited amount of antibody against any specific RXRXXS/T sequence, and thus the percent yield upon immunoprecipitation was antibody-limited and so less for the insulin sample. Considerably more pp60 was present in the immunoprecipitate derived from untreated adipocytes. Subsequently we found that pp32 could be isolated by immunoprecipitation from a nonionic detergent lysate of adipocytes (see Fig. 3 A). Immunoprecipitations of the phosphoproteins from SDS/nonionic detergent lysates of untreated and insulin-adipocytes were performed on a large scale (six 10-cm plates). The pp250, pp160, pp105, pp75, and pp60 bands were separated by SDS-PAGE, subjected to tryptic digestion, and the peptides sequenced by MS/MS. In a separate isolation pp32 was identified in this way after isolation from a nonionic detergent lysate of the LDM fraction of adipocytes, where it was most abundant (data not shown). Initially we have focused on pp160. MS/MS sequence analysis of the sample from insulin-treated cells yielded 15 peptides identical to those in the human protein gi7662198 and thus indicated that pp160 is the mouse version of this protein. gi7662198 is a protein of 1299 amino acids whose function is unknown. Its cDNA was previously cloned as part of a large scale cDNA cloning project (6Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The protein is predicted to contain two PTB domains and a Rab GAP domain (Fig.2). It has two sites, Ser-588 and Thr-642, that are predicted to lie in excellent motifs for Akt phosphorylation (2Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). To establish the identity of pp160 definitively, we raised an antibody against the carboxyl terminal sequence of the mouse protein and used it, together with the PAS antibody, in reciprocal immunoprecipitations and immunoblottings with nonionic detergent lysates of basal and insulin-treated adipocytes. The results exhibited the pattern expected (Fig. 3). Immunoprecipitation from the insulin lysate with the antibody against pp160 (hereafter referred to as AS160 for Akt substrate of 160kDa) yielded a 160-kDa protein detected by the PAS antibody (lane 4), and immunoprecipitation from the insulin lysate with the PAS antibody yielded a 160-kDa protein detected by the AS160 antibody (lane 6). Phosphorylation of AS160 was accompanied by a slight decrease in electrophoretic mobility (compare lanes 7and 8). MS/MS sequencing of the pp32 band from insulin-treated adipocytes identified 14 peptides from the 29-kDa ribosomal protein S6 together with smaller numbers of peptides from the similarly sized ribosomal S2, S3, and S3A proteins. Possibly these immunoprecipitated as a complex. It is likely that the PAS antibody reacted with the S6 protein in this mixture. The S6 protein is known to be phosphorylated by the 70-kDa S6 kinase on the Ser-236, which is in an RXRXXS sequence (RRRLSS236L) (11Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 101-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pp60 band, obtained from the lysate, of untreated cells contained the mouse version of the well characterized rat adipocyte protein perilipin. Perilipin is a 56-kDa protein that is associated with the lipid droplets; it is constitutively phosphorylated, is heavily phosphorylated in response to agents that activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and undergoes dephosphorylation in response to insulin (12Clifford G.M. McCormick D.K.T. Londos C. Vernon R.G. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The sites of perilipin phosphorylation have not been identified, but presumably the PAS antibody reacts with one of these. Perilipin contains only one Ser/Thr that is in a motif likely to react with this antibody, Ser-385 (KGRAMS385L). The pp 250-, 105-, and 75-kDa bands each contained peptides from several proteins. We are currently generating antibodies against the candidate in each band most likely to be the one reacting with the PAS antibody, to identify it. None of the proteins present in these bands are on the list of known Akt substrates (3Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether AS160 was phosphorylated on one or both of the predicted Akt sites (Fig. 2), the two predicted tryptic phosphopeptides were targeted for MS/MS in the tryptic digest of mouse AS160 isolated from insulin-treated adipocytes. The expressed sequence tag data base contains portions of the sequence of mouse AS160, and from these the sequences of the two mouse tryptic peptides corresponding to human tryptic peptides with Ser-588 and Thr-642 were obtained. The mouse and human sequences are: LGS588M(T)DSFER and AHT642FSHPPSSS(T)R(K), where each amino acid in parentheses is for the human sequence. The two tryptic phosphopeptides were detected by targeted MS/MS, and the resulting fragmentation spectra established that the sites of phosphorylation were Ser-588 and Thr-642. To determine directly whether AS160 was a substrate for Akt, we examined the phosphorylation of recombinant AS160, as well as mutant forms with Ser-588, Thr-642, or both converted to Ala, by recombinant Akt 1. Phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting with the PAS antibody. The data in Fig. 4 shows that Akt phosphorylation of AS160 and its S588A mutant yielded AS160 that was detected well by the PAS antibody. In contrast, Akt phosphorylation of the T642A mutant yielded an AS160 that reacted very weakly with the PAS antibody (see the legend to Fig. 4), and phosphorylation of the double mutant resulted in an AS160 that showed no detectable reaction with the PAS antibody. Thus, Akt phosphorylated AS160 on Thr-642 and probably on Ser-588. The PAS antibody probably binds more strongly to the phosphopeptide sequence containing Thr-642 than to that containing Ser-588. We have also examined the phosphorylation of AS160 and the T642A/S588A mutant after isolation by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG from SDS/thesit lysates of basal and insulin-treated transfected COS7 cells. In this in vivo system insulin stimulated phosphorylation of AS160 3-fold, and the T642A/S588A mutant showed almost no phosphorylation, as assessed by blotting with the PAS antibody (data not shown). In untreated adipocytes AS160 was concentrated in the LDM fraction (Fig.5 A). Treatment with insulin caused a marked redistribution of AS160 from the LDM to the cytosol. As is the case for AS160 phosphorylation, treatment with wortmannin or LY294002 inhibited the insulin-elicited redistribution (Fig.5 B). One of the components of the LDM is vesicles containing the glucose transporter GLUT4 (13Morris N.J. Ross S.A. Lane W.S. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3582-3587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In response to insulin these move to and fuse with the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 14Simpson F. Whitehead J.P. James D.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We isolated GLUT4 vesicles from the LDM by immunoadsorption (13Morris N.J. Ross S.A. Lane W.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3582-3587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and found by immunoblotting that AS160 was not located in these vesicles (data not shown). SDS lysates of mouse tissues were immunoblotted for AS160 with the AS160 antibody. All the tissues examined (brain, testes, spleen, kidney, pancreas, lung, thymus, liver, heart, quadriceps, and brown and white fat) showed a band at ∼160 kDa, with the strongest signals in the brain and pancreas (data not shown). Thus, these results indicate that AS160 has a widespread tissue distribution. Previously the mRNA for AS160 was shown to be widely expressed in human tissues (6Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This study illustrates a method for the isolation of substrates for serine kinases by means of phosphomotif-specific antibodies, which are now becoming commercially available. Application of the method requires that the serine kinase have a specificity for Ser/Thr within a fairly well defined motif and that the antibody against the phosphomotif functions in immunoprecipitation. The method is best applied in cell types where the kinase can be activated by some agent so that the phosphoproteins reacting with the phosphomotif-specific antibody after activation can be compared with those seen before activation. Using this approach, we have identified one novel substrate for Akt, AS160, and expect to identify at least two more, pp250 and pp105. One complication of the method is that in a number of instances several kinases have very similar specificity with respect to the motif in which the Ser/Thr lies, and consequently the definitive identification of the activated kinase responsible for phosphorylation requires information from other types of experiments. Our results illustrate this situation. The insulin-elicited pp32 proved to be ribosomal S6 protein that was phosphorylated by S6 kinase rather than Akt. In addition, the serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase has a specificity that is very similar to that of Akt and is activated by insulin (15Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is possible that some of the substrates detected with the PAS antibody are targets of this kinase, rather than or in addition to Akt. The AS160 protein is a previously undescribed Akt substrate. Our results show that insulin treatment of adipocytes causes its subcellular redistribution and are consistent with the proposal that this effect is due to its phosphorylation. In its overall structure AS160 partially resembles a recently characterized GAP for Rab6, which has a single PTB domain in its NH2 terminus and a Rab GAP domain 34% identical to the one in AS160 (16Cuif M. Possmayer F. Zander H. Bordes N. Jollivet F. Couedel-Courteille A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Langsley G. Bornens M. Goud B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1772-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Since the Rabs are key proteins in membrane trafficking (17Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of AS160 by Akt may function to connect insulin signaling to membrane trafficking through an effect on its GAP activity toward a particular Rab. Insulin-stimulated trafficking of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane requires activation of PI 3-kinase, and there is evidence that Akt is a downstream kinase required for this process (14Simpson F. Whitehead J.P. James D.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Cho H., Mu, J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Chrenshaw III, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the fact that AS160 is not located in GLUT4 vesicles, it remains a candidate to be a component of the signaling pathway from the insulin receptor to GLUT4 trafficking. Efforts are under way to test this possibility and to identify the Rab for which AS160 is a GAP."
https://openalex.org/W1991995900,"The androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, is thought to play an important role in the development of prostate cancer. The AR is a hormone-dependent transcription factor that activates expression of numerous androgen-responsive genes. Histone acetyltransferase-containing proteins have been shown to increase activity of several transcription factors, including nuclear hormone receptors, by eliciting histone acetylation, which facilitates promoter access to the transcriptional machinery. Conversely, histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been identified which reduce levels of histone acetylation and are associated with transcriptional repression by various transcription factors. We have previously shown that Tip60 (Tat-interactive protein, 60 kDa) is a bona fideco-activator protein for the AR. Here we show that Tip60 directly acetylates the AR, which we demonstrate is a requisite for Tip60-mediated transcription. To define a mechanism for repression of AR function, we demonstrate that AR activity is specifically down-regulated by the histone deacetylase activity of HDAC1. Furthermore, using both mammalian two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that AR and HDAC1 interact, suggestive of a direct role for down-regulation of AR activity by HDAC1. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we provide evidence that AR, Tip60, and HDAC1 form a trimeric complex upon the endogenous AR-responsive PSA promoter, suggesting that acetylation and deacetylation of the AR is an important mechanism for regulating transcriptional activity.

Upon binding to androgens within the cytoplasm, the AR translocates to the nucleus (4Ozanne D.M. Brady M.E. Cook S. Gaughan L. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1618-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where it recognizes and binds specific promoter elements and activates transcription of target genes through the concerted action of two transcriptional activation domains, namely activation function-1 (AF-1) and -2 (AF-2) (5Brinkmann A.O.

The AF-2 domain of NHRs plays a fundamental role in receptor-mediated transcriptional activation. Upon ligand-binding, the C-terminal AF-2 undergoes a shift in conformation generating a platform suitable for protein-protein interaction with co-activator molecules (6Weatherman R.V. Fletterick R.J. Scanlan T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 559-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 7Bourguet W. Germain P. Gronemeyer H. Trends Pharmacol.

To date, numerous co-activator molecules have been identified that function to enhance the transcriptional potential of NHRs (8Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). The majority of co-activators identified share the capacity to elicit histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, a catalytic process heavily implicated in target gene activation via chromatin remodeling (9Berger S.L.

Of the identified HAT-containing co-activators, several have emerged to play significant roles in NHR activity, including the p160 (11Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell.

Whereas histone acetylation is important for initiating and maintaining transcriptionally active genes, the recruitment of factors involved in deacetylating target promoters is deemed to be a requisite for gene silencing. Numerous co-repressor molecules have been identified, such as Sin3 (17Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E.

A. 1996; 93: 7567-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which play an active role in transcriptional repression by numerous transcription factors such as unliganded class II NHRs (19Nagy L.

These repressors are found in complex with histone deactylases (HDACs); enzymes that actively reduce the level of histone acetylation. To date, three groups of histone deacetylases have been identified. The class I family is composed of 4 members, HDAC1–3 and HDAC8, and are homologues of the yeast protein RPD3 (20Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Six class II HDACs have been characterized, HDAC4–7, -9, and -10, which bear significant homology to the HDA protein of yeast (20Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Class III HDACs are homologous to the yeast Sir2 protein, but as yet, are not well characterized.

Recently, the AR has been found to be a substrate for p300- and PCAF-mediated FAT activity (25Fu M.F. Wang C.G. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H. Siconolfi-Baez L. Ogryzko V. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20853-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Acetylation of three lysine residues in the short lysine-rich motif KLKK, flanking the DNA-binding domain (DBD), increases transcriptional activity of the AR, implicating this post-translational modification as a mechanism for regulating AR activity. Tip60 (Tat-interactive protein, 60 kDa) was first identified in complex with the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (26Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and was later demonstrated to directly acetylate histones H2A, H3, and H4 via a C-terminal HAT domain (27Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We previously identified Tip60 as an AR-interacting protein and showed Tip60 as a bona fideco-activator for the AR (28Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that Tip60 is a class I NHR-specific co-activator implicating an important role for Tip60 in steroid hormone receptor function (29Gaughan L. Brady M.E. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46841-46848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To further define the role of Tip60 in AR-mediated gene expression, we provide evidence that Tip60 directly acetylates the AR in vivo, which is a requisite for Tip60-mediated AR co-activation. We next investigated the potential for HDACs to influence AR transcriptional activity. Here we demonstrate that the AR is specifically down-regulated by the histone deacetylase activity of HDAC1, the effect of which can be reversed by the HAT activity of Tip60. In mammalian two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that HDAC1 interacts directly with the AR. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate that Tip60 and HDAC1 associate with the endogenous AR-responsive PSA promoter in LNCaP cells, implicating an important physiological role for acetylation and deacetylation in AR regulation. Together, the data suggests that the acetylation status of the AR is a dominant factor in regulating transcriptional activity, and is the first evidence that HDAC1 can down-regulate a member of the class I nuclear hormone receptor family.

Tip60-specific antibody was generated by injecting rabbits with a Tip60 peptide (amino acids 283–297) and then the antibody was affinity purified. Cell culture and DNA transfection were performed as described previously (28Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol.

COS-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. 1 × 104 COS-7 cells were routinely plated per well in 24-microtiter plates (Corning). After 24 h, the cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 2 h, cells were washed and incubated either in FCS-containing media prior to treatment with 100 nmtrichostatin A (TSA), or in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FCS that had been stripped of steroids by treatment with dextran-coated charcoal prior to experimentation with 10 nm R1881 (synthetic androgen analogue). After 48 h, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Promega). Luciferase activity was corrected for the corresponding β-galactosidase activity to give relative activity as described previously (28Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E.

In general, TSA treatment lasted 12 h prior to cell harvesting, whereas treatment with R1881 lasted the duration of transfection. The prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was cultured as above. For transfections, a superfect:DNA ratio of 3:1 for COS-7 cells was increased to 5:1 for LNCaP cells and the incubation period for transfection mixtures was increased from 2 h for COS-7 cells to 3 h for LNCaP cells. In general, co-transfection experiments using both COS-7 and LNCaP cells incorporated 50 ng of each expression vector and 200 ng of each reporter construct. Fold increases were determined for 50 ng of expression vector by comparing the activity with empty pCMV-driven vector. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated a minimum of three times. COS-7 cell lysates were boiled in SDS sample buffer (100 mm dithiothreitol, 125 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) for 10 min and equivalent amounts of protein were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were subsequently transferred to HybondTM membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and detected by specific antibodies (see Figs. 1, 3, and 6) using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.Figure 3HDAC1 represses AR-mediated transactivation.

Samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation, as described in Ref. 28Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, soaked in Amplify (AmershamBiosciences), and then exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 72 h. To determine a direct role for Tip60 HAT activity in AR acetylation, COS-7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3-AR, pCMV-Tip60, or pCMV-Tip60Q377E/G380E per 90-mm dish and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal anti-AR antibody (as described before) and immunoblotting with an anti-acetyllysine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) to detect the acetylated AR species. To examine a potential AR-HDAC1 interaction, COS-7 cells transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3-AR and pJB5-FLAG-HDAC1 per 90-mm dish were subjected to immunoprecipitation as before using an anti-FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate HDAC1-associated complexes and immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti-AR antibody. LNCaP cells were grown on 150-mm dishes in FCS-containing media for 2 days until ∼5 × 106 cells were present. 16 h prior to androgen treatment, cells were transferred to steroid-depleted media (RPMI supplemented with 10% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped FCS). After 16 h, the media was replaced with FCS-stripped media supplemented with or without 10 nm R1881 for the specified time period (see Fig. 8). Following treatment, LNCaP cells were treated with formaldehyde, added directly to culture medium (to a final concentration of 1%), at room temperature for 10 min to cross-link histone proteins to DNA. Soluble chromatin was made as follows: cells were washed and detached by scraping following addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml pepstatin, and pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min at 700 × g. The latter two steps were repeated. The cell pellet was then subjected to immunoprecipitation by resuspending in lysis buffer (50 mmTris (pH 8.1), 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.6 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.6 μg/ml aprotinin), followed by sonication. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was decanted and diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 140 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.6 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.6 μg/ml aprotinin). To pre-clear chromatin solution, 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) was added to each sample and agitated for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation and the supernatant was collected. For immunoprecipitation, 2 μg of polyclonal AR antibody, monoclonal HDAC1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), or Tip60 polyclonal antibody (see above) were added to 1 ml of the purified chromatin sample and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered by adding 60 μl of salmon sperm/protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. Beads were washed sequentially for 5 min each in 10 ml of TSE buffers I–III and TE (pH 8), as described previously (36Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were eluted by adding 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1m NaHCO3) to beads and subsequently heated for 4 h at 64 °C to reverse formaldehyde-induced cross-links. DNA were then recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and resuspended in 50 μl of TE. Semiquantitative PCR was performed with 10 μl of DNA, Bio-Taq DNA polymerase, and [α-32P]dATP, using primers P1F (GTGGAGCTGGATTCTGGG) and P4R (TGGGTACGATCCCCGATT), to amplify the 235 bp of the PSA promoter, encompassing the ARE2 (see Fig. 8). PCR products were resolved, dried, and then exposed to x-ray film for 2–12 h. The AR has been demonstrated to be directly acetylated by p300 and PCAF. Acetylation of the AR was shown to enhance inherent transcriptional activity of the AR, suggesting that acetylation plays a significant role in AR regulation (25Fu M.F. Wang C.G. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H. Siconolfi-Baez L. Ogryzko V. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20853-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We previously identified Tip60 as a bona fide co-activator for the AR (28Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Considering that Tip60 contains a HAT domain, which has been shown to acetylate free histones H4, H3, and H2A (27Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we sought to examine if, like p300 and PCAF, Tip60 directly acetylated the AR to increase transcriptional activity. To determine whether the AR is a target for Tip60-mediated acetylation in vivo, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type AR and either Tip60 or empty vector for control, and incubated for 1 h in [3H]acetic acid prior to immunoprecipitation with an anti-AR antibody. The level of AR acetylation was determined by measuring [3H]acetate incorporation into the AR protein using autoradiography. Previous work has shown that addition of the HDAC inhibitor TSA greatly enhances AR activity, suggesting that the AR is a potential target for direct deacetylation and down-regulation by HDACs (25Fu M.F. Wang C.G. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H. Siconolfi-Baez L. Ogryzko V. Avantaggiati M.L. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20853-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We incorporated 100 nm TSA into our system to block the action of deacetylase enzymes. As shown in Fig.1 A, a, in the presence of Tip60, the level of AR acetylation was increased substantially over that in the absence of Tip60 (compare lanes 1 and 2), indicating that Tip60 may directly acetylate the AR, presumably through the activity of the HAT domain. Our results also indicate that in the absence of overexpressed Tip60, endogenous factors within COS-7 cells have the capacity to induce AR acetylation (lane 1). Whether this modification is through the HAT activity of endogenous Tip60, or other potential HAT-containing proteins, such as p300 and PCAF, remains to be determined. Using Western blotting, incorporating an anti-AR antibody, we confirmed that the difference in acetylation observed was not from variation in transfection efficiencies between the samples (Fig. 1 A,b). To establish that the HAT activity of Tip60 was responsible for directly acetylating the AR, the ability of wild-type Tip60, and a HAT-defective Tip60 mutant (Tip60Q377E/G380E) (25Fu M.F. Wang C.G.

COS-7 cells transiently transfected with full-length AR and wild-type Tip60 or Tip60Q377E/G380E were immunoprecipitated using an anti-AR antibody followed by immunoblotting incorporating an anti-acetyllysine antibody, to compare the levels of AR acetylation in the presence of either wild-type Tip60 or Tip60Q377E/G380E. We figured that if AR hyperacetylation is a result of Tip60-mediated HAT activity, then overexpression of the Tip60 HAT mutant, which lacks a functional HAT domain through the substitution of two residues (Glu-377 and Gly-380) required for acetyl-CoA binding (35Ikura T.

Single and multiorganism DNA libraries originating from various environments were targeted for activity and sequence-based screening approaches. After initial screening, 15 clones were designated as primary hits based upon activity at pH 4.5 or 95 °C without addition of endogenous Ca2+. After further characterization, three enzyme candidates were chosen each with an exceptional expression of one or more aspects of the necessary phenotype: temperature stability, pH optimum, lowered reliance on Ca2+ and/or enzyme rate. To combine the best aspects of the three phenotypes to optimize process compatibility, the natural gene homologues were used as a parental sequence set for gene reassembly. Approximately 21,000 chimeric daughter sequences were generated and subsets screened using a process-specific, high throughput activity assay. Gene reassembly resulted in numerous improved mutants with combined optimal phenotypes of expression, temperature stability, and pH optimum. After biochemical and process-specific characterization of these gene products, one α-amylase with exceptional process compatibility and economics was identified.

These include starch hydrolysis for the production of ethanol and high fructose corn syrup, starch soil removal in laundry washing powders and dish-washing detergents, textile de-sizing, the production of modified starches, baking, hydrolysis of oil-field drilling fluids, and paper recycling. Since 1980, the most widely used enzyme for these applications has been the α-amylase isolated from the ubiquitous mesophilic soil bacterium Bacillus licheniformis (1Saito N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 155: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Yuuki T. Nomura T. Tezuka H. Tsuboi A. Yamagata H. Tsukagoshi N. Udaka S. J. Biochem.

Acta. 1974; 365: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This enzyme operates optimally at 90 °C and pH 6, and it requires addition of calcium (Ca2+) for its thermostability (4Violet M. Meunier J.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), conditions that are substantially different from those encountered in the various industrial processes where the enzyme is utilized. The disparity between these industrial requirements and the native environment for the α-amylase results in sub-optimal enzymatic performance in many applications. Corn wet milling is an example of a multistep industrial process where there is considerable scope for enzyme performance improvement. Initially, whole corn kernels are fractionated into semi-purified streams of protein, fiber, oil, and starch. The resulting starch fraction has a pH of 4.5. The next process step involves liquefaction of the semi-purified starch to glucose oligomers by the B. licheniformis α-amylase, ideally at a pH of ∼4.5 and a temperature of 105 °C. However, because the enzyme is unstable under these conditions (5Hashida M. Bisgaard-Frantzen H. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 389-401Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the pH must be increased to 5.7–6.0 and calcium added (5Hashida M. Bisgaard-Frantzen H. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 389-401Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The second step in the process involves saccharification of the liquefied product using a glucoamylase enzyme isolated from anAspergillus sp. Because the glucoamylase activity optimum is pH 4.2–4.5 (5Hashida M. Bisgaard-Frantzen H. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 389-401Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the pH must be returned to pH 4.5 for this step to proceed efficiently. The final step in the process involves conversion of the saccharified glucose to high fructose corn syrup using glucose isomerase. Prior to this final step, the calcium added in the first step and the salts generated from the second step must be removed. Removal of these compounds is an expensive part of the overall process and could be avoided if the liquefaction step utilized an α-amylase enzyme capable of liquefying starch at pH 4.5 and 105 °C without the addition of calcium. The study of hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea, which grow optimally at temperatures >80 °C, has resulted in the discovery of many thermostable enzymes with industrial applications. These include a number of extracellular amylolytic enzymes from cultured microbes (6Frillingos S. Linden A. Niehaus F. Vargas C. Nieto J.J. Ventosa A. Antranikian G. Drainas C. J. Appl.

Kobayashi T. Kanai H. Akiba T. Kudo T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent review of the sequence similarity of these enzymes (16Leveque E. Janecek S. Haye B. Belarbi A. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 26: 3-14Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar) revealed that they are all members of the glycosyl hydrolase family 13 (17Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar) and that they share a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (>76%), yet they display biochemical phenotypes that vary significantly in parameters such as T opt, pHopt, and metal ion requirements (e.g.Ca2+). This work describes the discovery of a group of thermostable α-amylase genes from nature and the subsequent laboratory evolution of a novel and improved chimeric α-amylase with performance characteristics ideal for the corn wet milling process. The approach taken utilizes access to biodiversity, ultra-high throughput screening, and GeneReassemblyTM, a proprietary DNA recombination technology. More than 2000 genomic DNA libraries from DNA purified directly from environmental samples, isolates, and primary enrichments have been constructed. Samples were collected under formal agreement with all legal parties. The method of generating these libraries has been described previously in United States patent number 5,958,672 (18Short, J. M. (June 3, 1996) U. S. Patent 96-657409(5958672), 22Google Scholar). These libraries represent a vast array of ecological niches and biotopes that span the globe. A targeted subset of these libraries was chosen for α-amylase discovery based on the temperature and pH of the environmental sample used to generate the library. Examples of environments used to generate libraries in this study include a variety of different geographical deep-sea enrichments and acid soil environments. Approximately 50,000 clones from selected λ DNA libraries were plated to produce plaques on semi-solid medium according to standard procedures (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). An isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-soaked (1 mm) nitrocellulose membrane was overlaid to both induce and replicate the clones (minimum of 5 min). After duplication, a substrate solution containing 0.1–1.0% azo-dyed starch (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1% w/v agarose was heated until completely liquefied. The solution was cooled to around 50–70 °C, applied over the surface of the original plates, and allowed to cool to room temperature. Finally, the plates were heated to ∼75 °C for 15–60 min in a sealed bag. Positive plaques, identified by the appearance of a clearing zone or “halo,” were then purified. A 500-bp PCR product corresponding to amino acid residues 30–197 derived from the α-amylase BD5031 was radioactively labeled and used to probe appropriate DNA libraries using standard methods (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). All α-amylase genes were PCR-amplified using the α-amylase degenerate primers, without their native signal sequence, and cloned into aPseudomonas-Escherichia coli shuttle vector using appropriate restriction enzymes and standard techniques (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). All molecular biology manipulations were performed in E. coli, and the resulting constructs were transformed into a proprietaryPseudomonas fluorescens strain. To express the various α-amylase constructs, they were grown to mid-log phase and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 19 h at 30 °C. Cell growth rate was measured by absorbance at 600 nm using a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer. The amount of protein expression was examined using SDS-PAGE with 10% acrylamide and a discontinuous buffer system. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the appropriate molecular weight region was examined for determination of α-amylase protein compared with the total protein. Nine fragments (FI—FIX in Fig. 1; each about 150 bp in length) were prepared from each of the three wild-type genes covering the whole open reading frame. Related DNA fragments were pooled (1:1:1), cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and gel-purified. Equal amounts of fragment pools were combined and ligated. The resulting ligation products were gel-purified and ligated to yield full-length reassembled α-amylase genes. Purified product was cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes, gel-purified, and ligated into an E. coli/Pseudomonas shuttle vector. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli. Plasmid DNA was isolated from pooled colonies (∼21,000) and transformed into P. fluorescens. Reassembled libraries were transformed into P. fluorescens, and the transformants were sorted into 384-well plates at 1 cell per well. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. Clones were replicated into a new 384-well plate for storage at 4 °C. An equal volume of 12m urea as cell volume was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. For the assay, 5 μl of lysate was added to 75 μl of 1% RBB-insoluble cornstarch in 50 mm NaOAc buffer, pH 4.5, in a new 96-well plate. The plates were sealed and incubated at 90 °C for 20 min. After cooling to room temperature, 100 μl of ethanol was added to each well. The plates were then spun at 4000 rpm for 20 min using a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was transferred to a new plate, and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a Beckman DU-7400 spectrophotometer. The α-amylases were recovered from 10-liter shake flask fermentations. Five grams of fermentation broth was mixed with 25 ml of deionized water in a 50-ml Falcon tube. The solution was vortexed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min (Sorvall, RC5C). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of fermentation broth with 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were heated to 80 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature. The samples were re-centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min (Sorvall, RC5C). The clarified supernatant was collected and concentrated by Centriprep-30. Amylase activity was determined in a continuous spectrophotometric assay by measuring the release of p-nitrophenol from the substrate, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl-α-d-hexa-(1,4)-glucopyranoside in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7, at 80 °C. To calibrate the enzyme assay, 50 μl of enzyme solution (diluted such that the ΔA 405/min was <1) was added to 950 μl of the substrate solution in a pre-heated cuvette at 80 °C, and the increase in absorbance at 405 nm was measured over 1 min. One standard unit of thermostable α-amylase was defined as being equal to the amount of enzyme that will catalyze the release of 1 mmol/ml/min ofp-nitrophenol under the defined conditions of the assay. For test samples, 10 μl of amylase solution from a shake-flask culture broth was added to 300 μl of 2% RBB corn starch (Sigma catalog number S-7776) in 50 mm NaOAc buffer pH 4.5 in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The mixture was incubated at 95 °C for 15 min and then cooled to room temperature. Ethanol (750 μl of 100%) was added to the mixture, and the tube was spun at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a 1-ml glass cuvette and read in a spectrophotometer at 595 nm. Glucoamylase activity was determined in a continuous spectrophotometric assay by measuring the release of p-nitrophenol from the 5 mmsubstrate p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7, at 80 °C. To calibrate the enzyme assay, 50 ml of enzyme solution (diluted such that the ΔA 405/min was <1) was added to 950 ml of substrate solution in a pre-heated cuvette at 80 °C, and the increase in absorbance at 405 nm was measured over 1 min. One standard “Diversa unit” of glucoamylase (DGA) is equal to the amount of enzyme that will catalyze the release of 1 mmol/ml/min ofp-nitrophenol under the defined conditions of the assay. Laboratory scale liquefactions were performed in an incubator (Werner Mathis, Labomat). Cornstarch (Sigma) was thoroughly mixed with 100 mm NaOAc buffer in a ratio of 3:7 (w/w). α-Amylase was then added, mixed, and the pH adjusted to the desired value. The resulting mixture was heated for 5 min at 105 °C, followed by 90 min at 95 °C, and then cooled to 60 °C. An aliquot of this solution was diluted (1:200, w/v) in distilled water, and the pH was adjusted to ∼2.0 by the addition of HCl. Liquefied starch solutions were sampled for dextrose equivalents determination. The DE of liquefied syrups was determined by measuring the quantity of reducing sugars (as glucose) by the neocuproine procedure (20Dygert S., Li, L.H. Florida D. Thoma J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 13: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The amount of glucose in the sample was determined by comparison to a known glucose standard (0.2 mg/ml). The percentage of glucose to the total carbohydrate (w/w) in the sample also known as DE is a measure of the starch hydrolysis. The reassembled and parental α-amylases were analyzed for stability at pH 4.5 and 90 °C in 66 mm sodium acetate buffer. The samples were heated at 90 °C for 10 min and cooled on ice. Residual activity was assayed using of p-nitrophenol hexa-glucopyranoside (2.5 mm) in 200 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7. Activity pre- and postincubation was measured to calculate residual activity. An analogous experiment was conducted at pH 4.5 and a temperature of 100 °C in 66 mm NaOAc buffer in the presence of 40 ppm calcium. The samples were boiled for 10 min, cooled on ice, and assayed for residual activity as described above. Line starch directly from an industrial starch process was pumped into a 60-liter feed tank where pH, dry solids, and calcium level were adjusted prior to liquefaction. The α-amylase was added to the 32% dry solid slurry and pumped at 0.7 liters/min to a pressurized mixing chamber, where the starch slurry was instantaneously heated to 105 °C. The gelatinized, partially liquefied starch was pumped under pressure to give the desired dwell time (5 min) at 105 °C. The pressure was released into a flash tank, and samples were taken. The liquefied starch was collected in 1-liter glass bottles and held in a water bath at 95 °C for 90 min. Liquefied starch was treated typically with 10 DGA units per kg of liquefied starch of glucoamylase at pH 4.5 and a temperature of 60 °C. Samples were recovered at various time points, and the extent of saccharification was monitored over time (2–88 h) by HPLC. Liquefaction and saccharification carbohydrate profiles were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87C column in calcium form at 80 °C using refractive index detection. Discovery and optimization of robust enzymes to catalyze specific chemistries in an industrial setting rely on the implementation of a number of technologies. Under agreements with countries around the world, samples have been collected from a myriad of natural environments, many of which display environmental variables of extreme pH, temperature, pressure, organic contaminants, salt concentration, etc. The DNA representing the microbial constituents of the sample is processed into complex gene libraries. These libraries, made from DNA extracted from soils or aqueous environments, are screened for genes coding for enzymes of desired phenotypes using targeted expression assays and sequence homology-based methods (21Robertson D. Mathur E. Swanson R.V. Marrs B.L. Short J. SIM News. 1996; 46: 3-8Google Scholar). To target discovery of new α-amylases applicable to the corn wet milling process, libraries containing the genomes of between 1 and 15,000 organisms were screened either by enzymatic activity or sequence homology to known α-amylases. These technologies enable screening of 105–109 clones/day from gene libraries using pH and temperature conditions approximating those of the corn wet milling process. α-Amylase expression screening was performed in semi-solid agar plates or in liquid-based format in microtiter plates using azo-dyed starch as the substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”). Clones with the highest activity on the azo-dyed starch were sequenced. Open reading frames were subjected to homology searches (BLAST) using the non-redundant gene data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Libraries also were screened using degenerate PCR primers; in brief these primers were designed to incorporate sequences found at the N and C termini of known hyperthermophilic α-amylases. By using these probes, single organism or environmental DNA libraries were screened for sequence homologues. Homologous DNA inserts were sequenced and re-cloned for expression, and their α-amylase activity was verified. Following this concerted discovery effort, three enzymes, designated BD5031, BD5064, and BD5063 (internal classification labels) were selected. These enzymes each had near-optimal characteristics for the corn wet milling process. The sequences of these three proteins are shown in Fig. 1. BD5031 and BD5064 (both 461 amino acids in length) showed high levels of sequence identity to other hyperthermophilic α-amylases and were most similar (95 and 85% amino acid identity, respectively) to the α-amylase ofPyrococcus sp. KOD1 (12Tachibana Y. Leclere M. Fujiwara S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1996; 82: 224-232Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). BD5063 shared significant identity to both BD5031 and BD5063 (88 and 90% amino acid identity, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all three enzymes were members of the glycosyl hydrolase family 13 (17) and are likely to be from organisms closely related to the order of Thermococcales. α-Amylases were expressed in a P. fluorescens host using a proprietary cloning vector. BD5031 was produced with and without its signal peptide sequence. In order to simulate the first step of the corn wet milling process, heat-treated cell lysates were tested for their ability to liquefy starch under pH conditions ranging from 4.25 to 6.25 (Fig.2). The pH optima of the three wild-type α-amylases, BD5031, BD5063, and BD5064, were compared with the commonly used B. licheniformis α-amylase. Each of these three newly discovered α-amylases had superior characteristics compared with the Bacillus enzyme, but BD5063 had the greatest activity at pH 4.5 and a temperature of 105 °C. The relative level of α-amylase expression was found to be BD5031 > BD5064 > BD5063 (TableI). As with other heterologously expressed archaeal amylases reported previously (22Linden A. Niehaus F. Antranikian G. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 2000; 737: 253-259Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the majority of the α-amylase protein expressed in the Pseudomonas host was found as insoluble aggregates.Table ISummary of the biochemical and growth characteristics of clones containing the wild-type α-amylasesNameBD5031BD5064BD5063Expression1-aThe levels of expression are the % of total protein expressed in a Pseudomonas host.>30%∼20%∼5–10%Relative activity1-bThe relative activity represents whole cell activity at a per cell level at pH 4.5 relative to BD5063.15%21%100%pH optimum5.255.254.5Growth in fermenter1-cFinal A 575.>200∼30∼801-a The levels of expression are the % of total protein expressed in a Pseudomonas host.1-b The relative activity represents whole cell activity at a per cell level at pH 4.5 relative to BD5063.1-c Final A 575. Open table in a new tab After scaling to 10-liter fermenters, the pH and protein expression characteristics of all three enzymes were similar compared with those measured previously in smaller shake flasks (25 ml of media in a 250-ml flask). In the larger fermenter, BD5063 continued to maintain the best pH optimum (measured as liquefaction activity at the target pH) but was produced at much lower levels than the other two enzymes. In order to optimize the α-amylase productivity and expression phenotypes to better suit the commercial process, gene reassembly was performed using the three wild-type genes (Fig. 1) as parental sequence. Pooled fragments were ligated to produce chimeric α-amylase genes. Ligation of fragments from different parents with identical overhangs was predicted to produce all possible combinations with equal probability; the possible number of combinations of nine fragments from three different parents is 39 = 19,683, with only 3 of the 19,683 combinations regenerating the wild-type sequences. The reassembled genes were ligated into an E. coli/Pseudomonas shuttle vector and introduced intoE. coli by transformation. Plasmid DNA from ∼21,000 pooled colonies was isolated and introduced into P. fluorescens also by transformation. Twenty five random clones from the primary reassembled library were sequenced to determine the distribution of the 27 parental fragments among the daughter clones and to verify the efficacy of the reassembly protocol (TableII). Each clone had a unique sequence and exhibited an apparently random distribution of all parental sequence fragments with the exception of fragment IV.Table IIAnalysis of fragments of reassembled α-amylase clones25 random clones and 20 up-mutants were sequenced. The composition of the clones from the three different wild-type enzymes is shown (in percent).

The derived consensus composition as well as the composition of two improved clones discussed in the text is shown at the bottom.

The derived consensus composition as well as the composition of two improved clones discussed in the text is shown at the bottom. To identify enhanced α-amylases from the pool of reassembled clones, a screening strategy was designed to identify clones that exhibited high activity at pH 4.5 based upon normalized cell density. The protocol for the primary high throughput assay is shown schematically in Fig. 3. In brief, the reassembled clones were individually distributed into 384-well plates at an average inoculum of 1 cell per well and incubated for 24 h. The cells were then lysed with 6 m urea for 1 h to solubilize all α-amylase protein. An aliquot of cell lysate was transferred to a well in the screening plate containing Remazol Brilliant Blue (RBB)-labeled cornstarch in 50 mmNaOAc buffer at pH 4.5. The assay plates were incubated at 90 °C for 20 min. Following an ethanol precipitation step, enzymatic activity (release of RBB) was assessed by measuring absorbance at 595 nm. Detectable amylase activity was found in ∼40% of the reassembled clones. 145 daughter clones showed an increased activity on a per cell basis at pH 4.5, when compared with the three parental α-amylases in the primary screen. Seventy one of the best up-mutants were grown in shake flasks and subjected to a secondary screen for starch liquefaction. From the liquefaction screen a total of 34 clones was confirmed to have higher liquefaction activity at pH 4.5 when compared with the three wild-type enzymes on a per cell basis (data not shown). The α-amylase activity in each of these 34 clones was also tested for improved thermostability at pH 4.5. Twenty two of the 34 reassembled enzymes exhibited improved thermostability at 90 °C in the absence of added calcium when compared with BD5063, the most stable of the wild-type parental α-amylases. Similarly, 20 reassembled clones exhibited greater thermostability at 100 °C in the presence of 40 mg/liter calcium when compared with the wild-type α-amylase BD5063 (data not shown). Twenty seven of the 34 clones described above were further evaluated for their capacity to express α-amylase activity during large scale fermentation. Two of the reassembled clones, BD5088 and BD5096, were robust and grew to high cell density (>200A 575). By using these two clones, the α-amylase activity per liter of fermentation broth, as judged by the liquefaction assay, was increased 2–4-fold over the best wild-type α-amylase BD5031. The relative thermostability of the α-amylases BD5088 and BD5096 produced by reassembly, compared with the three wild-type α-amylases (BD5031, BD5064, and BD5063) and the B. licheniformis α-amylase, is shown in Fig.4. The half-lives of the chimeric α-amylases, at 90 °C and pH 4.5, and in the absence of calcium ions, were improved 40-fold when compared with the most stable wild-type α-amylase, BD5031. Calculation of improvement over B. licheniformis α-amylase is complicated by its immediate denaturation under the assay conditions. The pH profiles of α-amylases produced by clones BD5088 and BD5096 were similar to the wild-type α-amylase produced by BD5063, in the pH range 4.25–4.75 (Fig. 2). The fragment composition of the identified up-mutants showed some remarkable differences compared with the clones that had been randomly sequenced (Table II). For fragments I, IV, V, and VII, BD5063 is the most frequent parental sequence contributor, whereas BD5064 dominates for fragment II. Fragment II of BD5031 is not contained in any of the sequenced up-mutants, whereas BD5031 is the most frequent contributor in positions III and VI. Because of its optimal combination of temperature stability, pH profile, expression characteristics, and lack of stringent calcium ion requirement, the reassembled daughter gene product BD5088 was chosen as the"
https://openalex.org/W2141727688,"WY14,643 is a specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) agonist with strong hypolipidemic effects. Here we have examined the effect of WY14,643 in the A-ZIP/F-1 mouse, a model of severe lipoatrophic diabetes. With 1 week of treatment, all doses of WY14,643 that were tested normalized serum triglyceride and fatty acid levels. Glucose and insulin levels also improved but only with high doses and longer treatment duration. WY14,643 reduced liver and muscle triglyceride content and increased levels of mRNA encoding fatty acid oxidation enzymes. In liver, the elevated lipogenic mRNA profile (including PPARγ) in A-ZIP/F-1 mice remained unchanged. These results suggest that WY14,643 acts by increasing β-oxidation rather by than decreasing lipogenesis or lipid uptake. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies indicated that WY14,643 treatment improved liver more than muscle insulin sensitivity and that hepatic mRNA levels of gluconeogenic enzymes were reduced. Combination treatment with both WY14,643 and a PPARγ ligand, rosiglitazone, did not lower glucose levels more effectively than did treatment with WY14,643 alone. These data support the hypothesis that reducing intracellular triglycerides in non-adipose tissues improves insulin sensitivity and suggest that further investigation of the role of PPARα agonists in the treatment of lipoatrophic diabetes is warranted.

Lipoatrophic diabetes is intriguing because it is typically obesity, an excess of triglyceride in adipocytes, and not a deficiency of adipose tissue that causes insulin resistance. Here we have studied the A-ZIP/F-1 mouse, which closely mimics the severe human lipoatrophic phenotype, with a near complete lack of fat, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypoleptinemia, increased appetite, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis (3Moitra J.

Attempts at treatment of lipoatrophic diabetes can also yield insights into the causes and mechanisms underlying the metabolic complications. A number of lines of evidence point to elevated tissue triglyceride content in non-adipose tissue as a correlate, and possibly a cause, of insulin resistance (15Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). WY14,643 is a PPARα1 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α) activator that increases fatty acid oxidation by increasing transcription of genes encoding peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes (16Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Here we have tested the hypothesis that WY14,643 will decrease insulin resistance in A-ZIP/F-1 mice. Animal handling followed National Institutes of Health guidelines, and experimental procedures were approved by the NIDDK animal care and use committee. All A-ZIP/F-1 mice were 8–12-week-old hemizygous males on the FVB/N background. Wild type controls were matched for age and sex. Mice were typically housed 2–4 per cage, kept on a 12-hour light/dark cycle (0600–1800), and fed NIH-07 rodent chow (12.9 kcal % fat, Zeigler Brothers Inc., Gardners, PA) and water ad libitum. The treatment diet was powdered AIN-93G (Dyets, Bethlehem, PA) (17Reeves P.G. Nielsen F.H. Fahey G.C., Jr. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (6862) Google Scholar) with or without WY14,643 (ChemSyn Laboratories, Lenexa, KS) prepared daily using a coffee grinder. Mice were sacrificed in the non-fasted state between 0900 and 1200. Tissue was fixed in neutralized 10% formalin and processed by American Histolabs (Gaithersburg, MD). Serum samples were prepared from tail (weeks 0 and 1, awake) or retro-orbital (week 2, anesthetized) blood in non-fasting mice between 0900 and 1200. Glucose levels were measured using a Glucometer Elite (Bayer Corp., Elkhart, IN). Fatty acid (no. 1383175, Roche Diagnostics), triglyceride and β-hydroxybutyrate (no. 339-11 and no. 310-A, respectively, Sigma), and insulin (no. SRI-13K, Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO) were assayed according to the manufacturers' instructions. Extraction of tissue triglycerides with chloroform/methanol was modified from Burantet al. (5Burant C.F. Sreenan S. Hirano K. Tai T.A. Lohmiller J. Lukens J. Davidson N.O. Ross S. Graves R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2900-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). After hydrolysis with base, triglycerides were measured radiometrically using a glycerol kinase assay (18Gavrilova O. Leon L.R. Marcus-Samuels B. Mason M.M. Castle A.L. Refetoff S. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14623-14628Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Total RNA from liver and skeletal muscle was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and assayed as previously described (11Chao L. Marcus-Samuels B. Mason M.M. Moitra J. Vinson C. Arioglu E. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Additional probes include glucose-6-phosphatase (19Shelly L.L. Lei K.J. Pan C.J.

PCR was used to prepare the following additional probes: glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4: 5′ primer, 5′-CTCAGCAGCGAGTGACTGGGAC-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CCCTGAGTAGGCGCCAATGAGG)-3′; glycogen synthase (GS: 5′ primer, 5′-CGGGGAGAGGCAGATTTATCACCG-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-CACAGTGTCCCACAGCTGTTTCCG)-3′; and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC: 5′ primer, 5′-GGGACTTCATGAATTTGCTGATTCTCAGTT-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-GTCATTACCATCTTCATTACCTCAATCTC-3′). The clamp protocols are based on those of Jason Kim and Gerald Shulman 2Haluzik, M., Dietz, K. R., Kim, J. K., Marcus-Samuels, B., Shulman, G. I., Gavrilova, O., and Reitman, M. L. (2002) Diabetes 51, in press. and were performed as described (20Kim J.K. Michael M.D. Previs S.F. Peroni O.D. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Neschen S. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance between the groups was determined with SigmaStat (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) using Student's t test or two-way ANOVA. A-ZIP/F-1 mice were treated for 2 weeks with the PPARα agonist WY14,643 (Fig.1). WY14,643 reduced the glucose levels slightly after 1 week and to nearly wild type levels after 2 weeks. The greatly elevated insulin levels remained unchanged. In contrast to the slow and partial glucose reduction, 1 week of WY14,643 treatment normalized the triglyceride and fatty acid levels in the A-ZIP/F-1 mice. In wild type FVB/N mice, WY14,643 affected only the triglyceride levels, which were reduced by 70% at both 1 and 2 weeks of treatment. In an independent experiment, A-ZIP/F-1 mice were treated for 2 weeks with different doses (control, 0.01%, 0.03%, and 0.1% of diet) of WY14,643. The highest dose gave results nearly identical to those in Fig. 1, except that the glucose levels were actually normal by 2 weeks of treatment (data not shown). Insulin levels did not change. Only when treatment was extended to 4 weeks did insulin levels fall (see below and Fig. 6). In marked contrast to the glucose and insulin levels, 1 week of treatment, even at the lowest dose, completely normalized the triglyceride and fatty acid levels. Thus, PPARα agonist treatment rapidly improves the lipid levels of A-ZIP/F-1 mice, but the reduction in glucose and insulin levels requires a higher dose and occurs with a slower time course. WY14,643 treatment changed body and liver weights (Fig.2). In wild type mice, WY14,643 reduced body weight, probably because of reduced adipose tissue weight. The control A-ZIP/F-1 group lost weight, possibly because of worsened diabetes due to the diabetogenic nature of the powdered AIN-93G control diet.2 In wild type mice and A-ZIP/F-1 mice, WY14,643 treatment increased liver weight, a known effect of the hepatocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia caused by PPARα agonists in mice (21Grasso P. Gibson G. Lake B. Peroxisomes: Biology and Importance in Toxicology and Medicine. Taylor and Francis, London1993: 639-652Google Scholar). The increase in A-ZIP/F-1 body weight was quantitatively accounted for by the increase in liver weight. Histologically, hepatocyte hypertrophy was caused by WY14,643 in both A-ZIP/F-1 and wild type mice (Fig.3 A). The WY14,643-treated A-ZIP/F-1 livers also showed decreased vacuolization, suggestive of reduced hepatic triglyceride levels. Indeed, liver triglyceride levels were reduced by 40% in the A-ZIP/F-1 mice and 41% in the wild type controls (Fig. 3 B). Muscle triglyceride levels were measured in quadriceps muscle. The levels in wild type muscle are problematic due to interspersed adipose tissue (5Burant C.F. Sreenan S. Hirano K. Tai T.A. Lohmiller J. Lukens J. Davidson N.O. Ross S. Graves R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2900-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), 3O. Gavrilova and M. L. Reitman, unpublished observations. but the lack of WAT in the A-ZIP/F-1 mice allows accurate measurement of intramyocellular triglyceride. WY14,643 treatment of the A-ZIP/F-1 mice reduced the muscle triglyceride levels by 44% (Fig.3 C). Liver and muscle both contribute to the insulin resistance of the A-ZIP/F-1 mouse (8Kim J.K. Gavrilova O. Chen Y. Reitman M.L. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8456-8460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We used the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp to investigate the improvement caused by WY14,643 treatment. The basal pre-clamp glucose values (after a ∼13-hour fast) were elevated in the control A-ZIP/F-1 mice but were reduced to normal in the WY14,643-treated A-ZIP/F-1 mice (TableI). The base-line insulin levels were similar between wild type and A-ZIP/F-1 mice despite their high glucose levels.Table IEuglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp measurementsStatisticsWT/cWT/wyAZIP/cAZIP/wy n = 5 n = 5 n = 4 n = 5Body weight (g)∗1-a∗, WY14,643versus untreated.++1-b+, interaction between transgene status and WY14,643 treatment.31.1 ± 1.523.8 ± 0.626.3 ± 1.827.7 ± 1.2Basal blood glucose (mg/dl)∧1-c∧, A-ZIP/F-I versuswild type. ∗∗ +176 ± 25143 ± 24301 ± 37144 ± 9Basal insulin (ng/ml)0.75 ± 0.110.16 ± 0.110.53 ± 0.080.57 ± 0.24Basal EGP (μmol/kg BW/min)++89 ± 12127 ± 14163 ± 2076 ± 9Clamp blood glucose (mg/dl)∧∧ ∗ +110 ± 2109 ± 3153 ± 12120 ± 7Clamp insulin (ng/ml)4.2 ± 0.83.5 ± 0.83.5 ± 0.54.1 ± 1.3Glucose infusion rate (μmol/kg BW/min)∧∧ ∗∗201 ± 26304 ± 1428 ± 1689 ± 20Whole body glycolysis (μmol/kg BW/min)∧∧200 ± 17208 ± 1765 ± 1589 ± 12Whole body glycogen synthesis (μmol/kg BW/min)∧29 ± 264 ± 1813 ± 719 ± 8Clamp EGP (μmol/kg BW/min)∧ ∗27 ± 8−33 ± 1650 ± 1818 ± 16Male mice were treated with 0.1% WY14,643 for two weeks, then fasted beginning at 1800 the evening before the clamp.

Statistical significance is from two-way ANOVA: single symbols are used forp ≤ 0.05 and double symbols for p ≤ 0.005. Base-line EGP was slightly increased in the WY14,643-treated wild type mice (Fig. 4 A), possibly because of the increased liver size (Fig. 2). In untreated A-ZIP/F-1 mice, basal EGP was high, as expected for their diabetes. Base-line EGP in the WY14,643-treated A-ZIP/F-1 mice was reduced. WY14,643 treatment caused increased insulin suppression of EGP in both wild type and A-ZIP/F-1 mice during the clamp (Fig. 4 B). Clamp EGP in the WY14,643-treated A-ZIP/F-1 mice was similar to that of the untreated wild type mice, reflecting the improvement in insulin sensitivity. WY14,643 treatment tended to increase whole body glucose uptake, a measure of muscle insulin sensitivity (Fig. 4 C). However, this was quantitatively small, suggesting that the A-ZIP/F-1 muscle remained quite insulin-resistant. Taken together, these data show that WY14,643 treatment reduces liver insulin resistance more than muscle insulin resistance. A possible explanation for the reduced tissue triglyceride levels is increased fatty acid oxidation, a known effect of PPARα agonists achieved via increased transcription of peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation genes (22Minnich A. Tian N. Byan L. Bilder G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 280: E270-E279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WY14,643 treatment increased liver CPT-1 and AOX mRNA levels about 1.5- and 7-fold, respectively, in both wild type and A-ZIP/F-1 mice (Fig. 5). Small but significant increases in AOX mRNA levels were observed in muscle (Fig. 5). The data suggest that increased liver, and possibly muscle, β-oxidation contributes to the lowered tissue triglyceride levels. In A-ZIP/F-1 mice, WY14,643 also reduced the liver mRNA levels of the gluconeogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphatase (Fig. 5). A-ZIP/F-1 mice have an increased lipogenic mRNA profile (Fig. 5, PPARγ, ACC,FAS) (11Chao L. Marcus-Samuels B. Mason M.M. Moitra J. Vinson C. Arioglu E. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and this was not changed by WY14,643 treatment. WY14,643 increased the lipogenic mRNA in the wild type mice. WY14,643 did not affect the liver mRNA levels of two genes important for insulin signaling, IRS-2 and SREBP-1, or of glycogen synthase or of muscle GLUT4 (Fig. 5). Rosiglitazone treatment of FVB/N A-ZIP/F-1 mice has little effect on serum glucose and insulin levels (11Chao L. Marcus-Samuels B. Mason M.M. Moitra J. Vinson C. Arioglu E. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), the net result of decreased liver and improved muscle insulin sensitivity. 4J. K. Kim and G. I. Shulman, unpublished observations. We reasoned that adding a PPARα agonist would treat the liver insulin resistance and might prove synergistic to the PPARγ agonist. However, treatment with both rosiglitazone and WY14,643 did not lower glucose, insulin, triglyceride, or fatty acid levels more than did treatment with WY14,643 alone, even when extended to a period of 4 weeks (Fig.6). WY14,643 treatment decreased liver triglyceride content, whereas rosiglitazone treatment increased it. Treatment with both rosiglitazone and WY14,643 caused a 2.1-fold increase (p = ns) in liver triglyceride as compared with WY14,643 alone and a 43% decrease (p = ns) in muscle triglyceride levels (Fig. 7). We have shown that the PPARα agonist WY14,643 greatly improves the metabolic phenotype of lipoatrophic A-ZIP/F-1 mice. The circulating triglyceride levels are normalized by a low dose and by short treatment durations. In contrast, the improvement in blood glucose levels required a higher dose and prolonged treatment. Clamp studies indicate that the improvement in the diabetes is mostly due to improved insulin sensitivity in liver, whereas muscle remained relatively resistant. The mechanisms by which the lack of adipose tissue causes insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia are partially understood. Leptin deficiency is a major component, causing insulin resistance and increased food intake (13Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Ikemoto S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Med. 2001; 7: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar). It is not known how the WAT-deficient status is communicated to the liver, but the result is abnormal metabolic regulation. This includes resistance to insulin-mediated suppression of glucose production but preservation of the insulin-mediated stimulation of lipogenesis and suppression of ketogenesis. It has been proposed that reduced hepatic IRS-2 levels account for the inappropriate glucose production, whereas maintained hepatic SREBP-1c explains the ongoing lipogenesis (26Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E. Bashmakov Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Livers of lipoatrophic mice also have elevated levels of PPARγ (11Chao L. Marcus-Samuels B. Mason M.M. Moitra J. Vinson C. Arioglu E. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. J. Clin.

Mice lacking PPARα develop hepatic steatosis upon fasting, confirming that PPARα is important for β-oxidation (31Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin.

Our results extend this observation to lipoatrophic diabetes, confirming evidence from one patient (34Panz V.R. Wing J.R. Raal F.J. Kedda M.A. Joffe B.I. Clin. Endocrinol. 1997; 46: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the WY14,643-treated mice provides some clues to the mechanisms underlying the physiology of lipoatrophic diabetes. The slow kinetics of the improvement in insulin sensitivity compared with the more rapid hypolipidemic effect is consistent with the hypothesis that insulin sensitization is due to a reduction in tissue triglyceride levels, a slow step that may take weeks to completely reach a new steady state. The mechanism by which adipose deficiency is signaled to the liver to cause increased lipogenesis is unknown (but is reversed by adipose transplantation or leptin infusion). Although WY14,643 treatment reduces liver triglyceride content and insulin resistance, it does not reduce hepatic PPARγ, ACC, or FAS mRNA levels, suggesting that WY14,643 does not interfere with the sensing of the low WAT signal by the liver. Addition of rosiglitazone treatment did not significantly improve the insulin sensitivity of WY14,643-treated mice. As expected, rosiglitazone did lower muscle and increase liver triglyceride levels compared with mice treated with WY14,643 alone. The lack of measured improvement in insulin sensitivity may be due to the relatively crude measurement used (glucose and insulin levels, as opposed to clamps) or the high degree of improvement already seen with this dose of WY14,643 by itself. In conclusion, PPARα agonist treatment normalized the dyslipidemia and improved the insulin resistance of A-ZIP/F-1 mice. It is likely that the improvement was caused by increased fatty acid oxidation. This caused decreased non-adipose triglyceride levels, thus secondarily improving insulin sensitivity. We thank Drs. P.

Agonist treatment of platelets also activates Rap1b, a small GTPase known to promote integrin-dependent adhesion of other cells. Therefore, we investigated the role of Rap1b in αIIbβ3 function by viral transduction of GFP-Rap1 chimeras into murine megakaryocytes, which exhibit inside-out signaling similar to platelets. Expression of constitutively active GFP-Rap1b (V12) had no effect on unstimulated megakaryocytes, but it greatly augmented fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 induced by a PAR4 thrombin receptor agonist (p < 0.01).

Ligand binding is regulated by positive and negative “inside-out” signals that converge on αIIbβ3 to control the integrin activation state through modulation of receptor affinity or avidity (1Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity modulation, the dominant mode of regulation in platelets, implies a change in the conformation of the αIIbβ3 heterodimer to increase access of ligand binding sites, while avidity modulation implies lateral movements of heterodimers in the plane of the plasma membrane, culminating in integrin clustering (2Xiong J.P.

Churchill-Livingstone, New York2000: 1753-1782Google Scholar).The signaling molecules directly responsible for regulation of αIIbβ3 downstream of excitatory receptors are incompletely characterized. Nonetheless, isoforms of protein kinase C and PI1 3-kinase as well as cytoplasmic free Ca2+ have been identified as key signaling intermediates (1Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Brass L.F. Hoffman R. Benz E. Shattil S. Furie B. Cohen H. Silberstein L. McGlave P. Hematology. Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill-Livingstone, New York2000: 1753-1782Google Scholar). In addition, αIIbβ3function in platelets appears to be regulated in some way by the actin cytoskeleton because inhibition of actin polymerization by low micromolar concentrations of cytochalasin D or latrunculin A increases agonist-dependent fibrinogen binding, whereas higher concentrations of these agents partially inhibit fibrinogen binding (11Bennett J.S. Zigmond S. Vilaire G. Cunningham M. Bednar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25301-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, protein kinase C, PI 3-kinase, and Ca2+may introduce post-translational modifications in signaling/cytoskeletal proteins that associate with and regulate αIIbβ3 (1Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H.

However, major gaps remain in the identification and characterization of integrin regulatory proteins in platelets.The Ras family GTPase, Rap1b, may be one such integrin regulatory protein. Like other Ras family members, it cycles from an inactive, GDP-bound form to an active, GTP-bound form, with cycling regulated by one or more guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (13Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Rap1b is highly expressed in platelets, is rapidly activated in response to agonists such as thrombin, ADP, or epinephrine and partitions along with αIIbβ3 to the Triton-insoluble core actin cytoskeleton of aggregated platelets (14Franke B. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 15White G.C., II Fischer T.H. Duffy C.M. Thromb.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12009-12015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Rap1b activation in response to thrombin depends initially on Ca2+ fluxes into the platelet cytoplasm and subsequently on protein kinase C (17Franke B. Van Triest M., De Bruijn K.M.T. Van Willligen G. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Negrier C. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the function of Rap1b in platelets is unknown, it has been implicated in promoting β1 and β2integrin-dependent adhesion of fibroblastic and hematopoietic cell lines and murine thymocytes (18Caron E. Self A.J. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 974-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The evidence for this is based largely on overexpression of constitutively active and dominant-negative forms of Rap1, but additional support for Rap1 involvement comes from studies of mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in the Rap1 GEF, C3G, which exhibit defective integrin-dependent adhesion that is correctable by expression of a constitutively active Rap1 mutant (23Ohba Y. Ikuta K. Ogura A. Matsuda J. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Kurokawa K. Mayer B.J. Maki K. Miyazaki J. Matsuda M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3333-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because, cell adhesion by integrins is dependent on a combination of factors, including inside-out signaling, ligand binding, and post-ligand binding events, the precise mechanism(s) whereby Rap1 promotes adhesion may vary with the integrin and the cell type.Based on these considerations, the present study was carried out to determine whether Rap1b is an effector of inside-out signaling to αIIbβ3. Because platelets are not amenable to genetic manipulation, we used Sindbis virus vectors to express specific GFP-tagged chimeric proteins in primary, mature murine megakaryocytes. Megakaryocytes are nucleated cells that function primarily to produce platelets, and like platelets they exhibit an inside-out signaling pathway from excitatory receptors to αIIbβ3 (24Zauli G.

The results establish that Rap1b, in concert with platelet agonists, can promote fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3. Furthermore, they indicate that Rap1b functions to modulate αIIbβ3 affinity, possibly through effects on the actin cytoskeleton.DISCUSSIONIn this study, recombinant human Rap1b constructs were expressed in primary murine megakaryocytes to assess the potential role of this GTPase in inside-out αIIbβ3 signaling. Megakaryocytes were chosen because they respond to platelet agonists by engaging fibrinogen via αIIbβ3, but unlike their anucleate platelet progeny, they are amenable to genetic manipulation (25Faraday N. Rade J.J. Johns D.C. Khetawat G. Noga S.J. DiPersio J.F. Jin Y. Nichol J.L. Haug J.S. Bray P.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 4084-4092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shiraga M. Ritchie A. Aidoudi S. Baron V.

French D.L. Steeber D.A. Bell W.R. Griffith M. White G.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 3645-3651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major new findings are the following. 1) Expression of constitutively active Rap1b (V12) augments fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 when megakaryocytes are stimulated through the PAR4 thrombin receptor. In contrast, expression of Rap1GAP, which inactivates endogenous Rap1, or expression of Rap1b (N17), a dominant-negative construct, has the opposite effect. 2) Modulation of fibrinogen binding by Rap1b appears to be due primarily to effects on αIIbβ3 affinity. 3) Regulation of αIIbβ3 activation state by Rap1b may depend on the actin cytoskeleton, because no Rap1b effect was observed if actin polymerization was blocked by cytochalasin D or latrunculin A. These results establish a role for Rap1b in affinity modulation of αIIbβ3, and they raise important new questions about the identities and mechanisms of action of the relevant Rap1b regulators and effectors in megakaryocytes and platelets.GFP-Rap1b and GFP-Rap1GAP constructs were introduced into mature, bone marrow-derived mouse megakaryocytes using Sindbis viruses. In this system, the recombinant proteins were expressed rapidly, and cell integrity was preserved long enough for functional studies of αIIbβ3 to be carried out. Indeed, viral transduction, per se, had no detrimental effect on αIIbβ3 surface expression or on agonist-induced fibrinogen binding (Fig. 4). In addition, N-terminal fusion of GFP to these constructs did not adversely affect their function, as exemplified by the ability of Rap1b (V12) to bind GTP and the ability of GFP-Rap1GAP to reduce GTP loading of endogenous Rap1 (Fig. 1). Because expression of GFP alone did not interfere with agonist-induced fibrinogen binding to megakaryocytes, the opposing effects on fibrinogen binding of GFP-Rap1b (V12) and GFP-Rap1GAP provide strong evidence that αIIbβ3activation can be modulated by Rap1b (Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, although the recombinant proteins used here were human in origin, the high degree of sequence conservation between human and murine Rap1b (e.g. 85% overall amino acid identity; 95% in the switch regions) 2G. C. White, unpublished observations. indicates that our results are unlikely to be complicated by species differences.One caveat in overexpression work with Rap1b (V12) and Rap1b (N17) is that the results obtained may not necessarily reflect the function of endogenous Rap1b. For example, dominant-negative Rap1b (N17) may exert functions in addition to the expected one of titrating Rap1 GEFs, and it may not titrate all Rap1 GEFs (32van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indeed, this may explain why GFP-Rap1GAP was a better inhibitor of agonist-induced fibrinogen binding to megakaryocytes than GFP-Rap1b (N17) (e.g. 46%versus 27%). Nonetheless, the present study demonstrates unambiguously that Rap1b can promote inside-out signaling to αIIbβ3 in primary megakaryocytes, thus providing a strong rationale to further evaluate the functional relationships between Rap1b and αIIbβ3 in platelets. The rapid activation of Rap1b in platelets stimulated with thrombin, ADP, or epinephrine is consistent with a role in inside-out signaling (14Franke B. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 15White G.C., II Fischer T.H. Duffy C.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 16Lova P.

Rap1b is a substrate for protein kinase A in platelets (38Fischer T.H. Gatling M.N. Lacal J.-C. White G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19405-19408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the significance of phosphorylation to Rap1b function is unclear, the phosphorylation of one or more proteins by protein kinase A inhibits agonist-induced ligand-binding to αIIbβ3 in platelets (39Walter U. Eigenthaler M. Geiger J. Reinhard M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 344: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Perhaps Rap1b is one of the relevant protein kinase A substrates in this context.This work provides new insights into the role of Rap1b in integrin function. Previous studies in fibroblasts, various hematopoietic cell lines and murine thymocytes have demonstrated that overexpression of Rap1 or its GEFs and GAPs affects cell adhesion, aggregation, and phagocytosis dependent on β1 or β2integrins (18Caron E. Self A.J. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 974-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10453-10462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because all of these responses involve integrin ligation as well as post-ligand binding events, these observed effects of Rap1 do not necessarily pinpoint which phase is targeted by the GTPase. However, in one study employing a B lymphocyte cell line, Rap1 (V12) increased the expression of an activation epitope on αLβ2 and the binding of a soluble ICAM-1/IgG fusion protein to the cells, consistent with affinity modulation of αLβ2 by Rap1 (19Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). On the other hand, work in transgenic thymocytes concluded that Rap1 was sufficient to modulate the clustering and avidity, rather than the affinity, of β1 and β2 integrins (22Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).In megakaryocytes, Rap1b increased fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, but only when the cells were stimulated with an agonist (Figs. 2 and 3). This suggests that signals from Rap1b are not sufficient to activate αIIbβ3, but rather they may be required to achieve maximal αIIbβ3 activation in response to agonist-triggered signals. Furthermore, the results with POW-2, a monomeric and monovalent ligand-mimetic Fab specific for high affinity murine αIIbβ3, establish that Rap1b functions, in large part, by modulating αIIbβ3 affinity in megakaryocytes (Fig. 5). Overall, these results indicate that Rap1 is capable of regulating the activation state of β1, β2, and β3 integrins. However, the precise mechanism of regulation, e.g. affinity versus avidity modulation, appears to depend on the integrin and the cell type. Future studies should consider the possibility that Rap1 may also influence post-ligand binding events, such as changes in cell shape or polarity (13Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar).How is Rap1b activated in megakaryocytes and platelets, and which Rap1b effector(s) modulate αIIbβ3 affinity? Addressing these questions is made complicated by the plethora of Rap1 GEFs and GAPs in various cells and tissues, some of which are not specific for Rap1 (13Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat.

Most importantly, relatively little information is available about the repertoire of Rap1 regulators and effectors in platelets and megakaryocytes. Because Rap1b (V12) augmented the fibrinogen binding response to a PAR4 thrombin receptor agonist, the relevant Rap1 GEFs or GAPs may themselves be regulated by signaling molecules activated downstream of one or more heterotrimeric G proteins. In this context, the products of phospholipase C-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis, Ca2+ and diacylglycerol, have been implicated in agonist-dependent Rap1b activation in platelets (17Franke B. Van Triest M., De Bruijn K.M.T. Van Willligen G. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Negrier C. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, platelets and megakaryocytes contain a Rap1 GEF (CalDAG-GEFI) likely to be activated by Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (41Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S. Canales J.J. Harlan P. Blumenstiel J.P.

Consequently, a conceptual link is often made between changes in the actin cytoskeleton and changes in integrin clustering or avidity (4Kucik D.F. O'Toole T.E. Zheleznyak A. Busettini D.K. Brown E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat.

We found that inhibition of actin polymerization by 10 μmlatrunculin A or cytochalasin D blocked Rap1b-dependent fibrinogen binding to megakaryocytes (Fig. 6). Because fibrinogen binding is controlled primarily by changes in αIIbβ3 affinity (Fig. 5) (3Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we propose that Rap1b may regulate αIIbβ3 affinity through an effect on actin dynamics or organization. A causal link between changes in actin and changes integrin affinity has not been established unambiguously. However, this idea is consistent with the recent observation that relatively low concentrations of cytochalasin D or latrunculin A, which may release integrins from cytoskeletal constraints, increase agonist-dependent fibrinogen binding to platelets (11Bennett J.S. Zigmond S. Vilaire G. Cunningham M. Bednar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25301-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this regard, at least two Rap1b effectors in platelets, RalGDS and p110 PI 3-kinase, have been proposed to influence actin filament organization (46Wolthuis R.M.F. Franke B. Van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 47Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl.

Studies in cell lines have demonstrated that Ras family members in addition to Rap1, such as H-Ras and R-Ras, can influence ligand binding to integrins, although the net effects vary considerably among cell types (51Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Ruoshlati E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 52Shibayama H. Anzai N. Braun S.E. Fukuda S. Mantel C.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given the suitability of primary megakaryocytes for the molecular analysis of αIIbβ3 signaling, the experimental system employed here should prove useful for identifying the physiological regulators and effectors of Rap1b responsible for modulating αIIbβ3 affinity and for determining the roles of other Ras family members in αIIbβ3function. The αIIbβ3 integrin is a receptor for adhesive ligands such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor, and ligand binding to αIIbβ3 is required for platelet aggregation and spreading in hemostasis. Ligand binding is regulated by positive and negative “inside-out” signals that converge on αIIbβ3 to control the integrin activation state through modulation of receptor affinity or avidity (1Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity modulation, the dominant mode of regulation in platelets, implies a change in the conformation of the αIIbβ3 heterodimer to increase access of ligand binding sites, while avidity modulation implies lateral movements of heterodimers in the plane of the plasma membrane, culminating in integrin clustering (2Xiong J.P.

Positive inside-out signals can be initiated by agonist occupancy of several different classes of excitatory receptors that couple to heterotrimeric G proteins and tyrosine kinases (5Brass L.F.

The zinc finger-containing transcription factor GATA4, which is widely expressed in mesodermal and endodermal derived tissues, is thought to regulate cardiac myocyte-specific gene expression through combinatorial interactions with other semi-restricted transcription factors such as myocyte enhancer factor 2, nuclear factor of activated T-cells, serum response factor, and Nkx2.5. Here we determined that GATA4 also interacts with the cardiac-expressed basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor dHAND (also known as HAND2). GATA4 and dHAND synergistically activated expression of cardiac-specific promoters from the atrial natriuretic factor gene, the b-type natriuretic peptide gene, and the α-myosin heavy chain gene. Using artificial reporter constructs this functional synergy was shown to be GATA site-dependent, but E-box site-independent. A mechanism for the transcriptional synergy was suggested by the observation that the bHLH domain of dHAND physically interacted with the C-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA4 forming a higher order complex. This transcriptional synergy observed between GATA4 and dHAND was associated with p300 recruitment, but not with alterations in DNA binding activity of either factor. Moreover, the bHLH domain of dHAND directly interacted with the CH3 domain of p300 suggesting the existence of a higher order complex between GATA4, dHAND, and p300. Taken together with previous observations, these results suggest the existence of an enhanceosome complex comprised of p300 and multiple semi-restricted transcription factors that together specify tissue-specific gene expression in the heart.

In addition to directly controlling cardiac structural and regulatory gene expression, cardiac-expressed GATA factors indirectly support tissue-specific gene expression by regulating expression of other transcription factors. For example, GATA factors regulate developmental expression of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor Nkx2.5, myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), and dHAND in the heart by providing a reinforcing transcriptional regulatory circuit mediated through direct promoter interactions (14Lien C.L., Wu, C.

Richardson J.A. Srivastava D. Firulli A.B. Olson E.N. Development. 2000; 127: 5331-5341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GATA4 was shown to directly interact with Nkx2.5 through the C-terminal zinc finger domain and the helix III region of the homeodomain present within each factor, respectively (18Durocher D.

GATA-4 also physically interacts by way of its C-terminal zinc finger with nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and MEF2 (21Molkentin J.D., Lu, J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Finally, GATA4 directly interacts with the MADS box-containing transcription factor serum response factor (SRF), which together synergistically regulate expression of the ANF and α-actin genes in cardiomyocytes (23Belaguli N.S. Sepulveda J.L. Nigam V. Charron F. Nemer M. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7550-7558Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Morin S. Paradis P. Aries A. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The studies discussed above suggest that cardiac-expressed GATA factors interact with an array of heterotypic transcription factors in the heart. In addition to transcription factor interactions, GATA4 interacts with discrete transcriptional co-activators or general repressors. For example, GATA4 was recently shown to directly interact with p300/CBP (cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein) resulting in synergistic gene activation (25Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37178-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal zinc finger domains of GATA4 directly interacted with the cysteine/histidine-rich (CH3) region of p300 (25Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37178-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Given the ability of p300/CBP to interact with a heterogeneous array of transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 26Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), the observed GATA4-p300 interaction suggested a mechanism whereby a diverse array of cardiac-expressed transcription factors could simultaneously interact through a p300 scaffold. GATA4 also interacts with the transcriptional modifying protein friend of GATA-2 (FOG-2) through a physical interaction involving the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA-4 (27Lu J.R. McKinsey T.A., Xu, H. Wang D.Z. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4495-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This interaction is conserved in Drosophila where the friend of GATA-2 homologue, U-shaped (Ush), interacts withpannier, a GATA homologue (30Haenlin M. Cubadda Y. Blondeau F. Heitzler P. Lutz Y.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Like GATA4 gene-targeted mice, disruption of the gene encoding the transcription factor dHAND results in embryonic lethality because of cardiac abnormalities, suggesting non-redundant roles for each of these factors in specifying developmental gene expression in vivo (36Srivastava D. Thomas T. Lin Q. Kirby M.L. Brown D. Olson E.N. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Whereas less is understood of the manner in which dHAND regulates target genes in the heart, PCR-mediated site selection identified a series of specific E-box consensus elements verifying the ability of dHAND to bind DNA (37Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12604-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the transcription factors GATA4 and dHAND physically interact with one another to synergistically regulate expression of cardiac gene promoters. The identified functional interaction is mediated through GATA, but not E-box DNA-binding sites, suggesting a dHAND-binding site-independent mechanism of regulation. Finally, dHAND was shown to physically interact with the transcriptional co-activator p300, which was necessary for functional synergy with GATA4. These data suggest a paradigm whereby cardiac-expressed transcription factors form large multisubunit complexes in conjunction with p300/CBP. GATA4-ΔN (N-terminal zinc finger) in the pMT2 expression vector was generated using PCR to delete amino acids 216–240, whereas the ΔC construct deleted amino acids 270–294 of GATA4. Expression vectors encoding GATA4 amino acids 253–441, wild type and site-specific mutants, were generated by PCR and subsequently subcloned into the pcDNA3.1-His vector (25Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. J.

For construction of pcDNA3.1-His-dHAND ΔC, full-length dHAND was digested with StuI at amino acids 166 and the resultant fragment (encoding amino acids 1–166) was cloned into pcDNA3.1-His vector in-frame. pcDNA3.1-His-dHANDΔN was generated by deleting the first 85 amino acids using a NarI restriction site. pcDNA3.1-His-bHLH was generated by deleting amino acids 86–166 of dHAND using NarI and StuI restriction enzyme sites. pcDNA3.1-His-dHAND ΔGTA was generated by deleting amino acids 102–104 of dHAND using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), which was further modified by substituting amino acid residues 107–111 of dHAND (i.e.KERRR) with 5 alanine residues using a combined PCR and ligase chain reaction technique as described previously (38Bi W.

The cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min. Lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with FLAG antibody-agarose (Sigma). The agarose was washed and the bound proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE and Western blotted. The blot was incubated with mouse anti-Myc (Sigma). A T7 mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Novagen, whereas GATA4 antiserum was purchased from Santa Cruz. All GST fusion proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Binding assays were performed with labeled proteins synthesized in vitrousing the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine (AmershamBiosciences) as described previously (25Dai Y.S.

Equal amounts of immobilized GST fusion proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of 35S-labeled proteins in GST binding buffer containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm Na acetate, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors, and 2 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml. After four washes in GST binding buffer, beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer to elute bound protein, which was subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. HeLa and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, streptomycin (10 g/liter), and penicillin (10 g/liter). All transfections were performed in 6-well plates with Lipofectin and LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen) or with Tfx-20 reagent (Promega). Cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of DNA containing the various reporter plasmids; α-MHC-GATAx4-Luc, α-MHC-LUC, ANF-LUC, ANF-GATAx6-LUC, and 0.3 μg of expression vectors for pFlag-GATA4, pFlag-BAP, pcDNA3-p300HAT, pMT2-GATA4, pMT2GATA4 mutants, pcDNA3-dHAND, and pcDNA3-dHAND mutants, whereas 0.6 μg of CMV-p300 and 0.1 μg of CMV-Id1, CMV-E1A, CMV-E12, and pcDNA3-p300 CH3 were used. CMV-β-galactosidase (20 ng in each well) was used as internal control. Luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer, which was normalized to β-galactosidase activity using Tropix's Galacto-Star reporter assay system (Tropix). Each value presented is the average of triplicate samples and is representative of multiple independent experiments. The data were statistically analyzed with a Student's t test. Cardiomyocyte cultures were prepared as described previously (41De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13571-13579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cultures were transfected in serum-free M199 medium and plated in triplicate 6-cm plates with 1 μg of ANF-luc reporter and 0.2 μg of Flag-GATA4 and 0.8 μg of pcDNA-His-dHAND in 6 μl of Tfx-20 reagent (Promega). The cardiomyocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 14 h post-transfection. The cardiomyocytes were lysed and luciferase activity was measured 24 h post-transfection. Conditions for EMSA were described previously (37Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12604-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The GATA DNA-binding site (from the ANF promoter) was 5′-CTGATAACTCTGATAACTCTGATAACTGGTAC, whereas the dHAND-binding site consisted of the sequence 5′-TCGACAGGGCCATCTGGCATTG. To gain greater insight into the transcriptional mechanisms whereby GATA transcription factors regulate cardiac-specific gene expression, we surveyed the ability of GATA4 to function in cooperation with the cardiac-enriched bHLH protein dHAND. Promoters from the ANF , BNP, and α-MHC genes were employed for analysis because each was previously shown to require GATA DNA binding activity for cardiac-specific expression (reviewed in Ref. 63Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In the presence of both GATA4 and dHAND expression vectors, the ANF promoter showed ∼40- and 60-fold induction in transiently transfected neonatal cardiomyocytes and HeLa cells, respectively (Fig.1 A). Whereas a similar degree of transcriptional synergy was observed in each cell type, HeLa cells lack some cardiac-expressed transcription factors that might otherwise dominantly regulate promoter activity. Indeed, transient transfection of the BNP and α-MHC luciferase fusion constructs into HeLa cells demonstrated a similar degree of synergy in the presence of co-transfected GATA4 and dHAND (Fig. 1, B and C). Importantly, co-transfection of GATA4 and dHAND expression constructs did not result in squelching of either factor compared with individually transfected cells (Fig. 1 D). These results indicate that the transcription factors GATA4 and dHAND functionally synergize to enhance expression of the assayed cardiac-expressed gene promoters. Finally, we also observed that the closely related transcription factors GATA5 and GATA6 synergized with dHAND on the ANF promoter, whereas eHAND (HAND1) did not synergize with GATA4 (data not shown). To analyze the mechanism of this observed transcriptional synergy between GATA4 and dHAND in more detail, multiple deletion constructs were generated and assayed. Deletion of the C terminus of dHAND did not significantly reduce GATA4 synergy on the ANF promoter, suggesting that this domain was dispensable for interaction (Fig.2 A). In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal transactivation domain in dHAND, or both N- and C-terminal domains together, reduced or eliminated transcriptional synergy (Fig. 2 A). However, it should be noted that dHAND contains a strong transcriptional activation domain only within its N terminus, suggesting that deletion of this domain could simply reduce the transcriptional potency of any underlying interaction (37Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12604-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Last, the basic domain of dHAND was directly mutated within the context of the full-length protein, which eliminated all transcriptional synergy (Fig. 2 A). Collectively, these results are consistent with the interpretation that GATA4 interacts with dHAND through the bHLH domain to augment transcriptional activation. To more carefully elucidate the critical interacting domains within GATA4, a similar series of deletion mutants was generated and assayed for functional synergy with dHAND. Deletion of the N-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA4 did not alter transcriptional synergy with dHAND, although deletion of the C-terminal zinc finger domain severely compromised the functional interaction (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA4 is most critical for mediating transcriptional synergy with dHAND. The transcriptional synergy observed between GATA4 and dHAND could result from either independent binding of each factor to its cognate site, or from a direct physical interaction. To test this later possibility, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs were generated and used for in vitro precipitation experiments. cDNA fragments encoding multiple domains of GATA4 were fused to the GST coding sequence to permit generation of each recombinant protein in bacteria. Each purified fusion protein was loaded onto a glutathione column and in vitro translated dHAND protein (35S-labeled methionine) was subsequently added to assay for interaction (Fig. 3). The data demonstrate that the C-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA4 strongly interacted with the in vitro translated dHAND, whereas the N-terminal zinc finger domain only showed a minimal interaction (Fig.3). Comparable quantity of each GST-GATA4 fusion construct was loaded onto GST beads (data not shown), suggesting that the zinc finger domains of GATA4 are capable of physically interacting with dHANDin vitro. To more carefully elucidate the interactive surface within the C-terminal zinc finger of GATA4, a series of sequential site-directed mutants was generated for in vitro translation and subsequent interaction with GST-dHAND. All site-directed GATA4 mutant proteins were produced at roughly similar levels by in vitrotranslation (Fig. 4, top panel). The data demonstrate that each GATA4 mutant was capable of physically interacting with dHAND, except the WRR-SSS mutant, which alters residues at the tip of the C-terminal zinc finger (Fig. 4). GST alone did not interact with any of the mutant or deletion constructs (Figs. 3 and 4). As a further control, deletion of the entire C-terminal zinc finger domain in GATA4 severely attenuated the interaction with dHAND (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results not only confirm the requirement of the C-terminal zinc finger domain for mediating the dHAND interaction, but they also suggest that residues within the tip of the GATA4 C-terminal zinc finger are most critical. To examine the domain of dHAND that facilitates GATA4 interaction, a series of dHAND deletion constructs were generated for production ofin vitro translated protein. Analysis of protein levels showed equivalent amounts of each dHAND deletion protein, except for the bHLH domain, which was only detected at ∼10% of the signal of the full-length protein (Fig 5 A). This decreased signal likely reflects the presence of far fewer methionine residues available for in vitrotranslation-dependent radioactive labeling compared with the larger fragments. In any event, the data demonstrate that the bHLH domain in dHAND is sufficient to mediate a physical interaction with a GST construct fused to the C-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA4, but not with GST alone (Fig. 5 A).

To determine whether cell surface-anchored carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) interacts with AE proteins to accelerate the bicarbonate transport rate, AE1-mediated bicarbonate transport was monitored in transfected HEK293 cells. Expression of the inactive CAII V143Y mutant blocked the interaction between endogenous cytosolic CAII and AE1, AE2, and AE3 and inhibited their transport activity (53 ± 3, 49 ± 10, and 35 ± 1% inhibition, respectively). However, in the presence of V143Y CAII, expression of CAIV restored full functional activity to AE1, AE2, and AE3 (AE1, 101 ± 3; AE2, 85 ± 5; AE3, 108 ± 1%). In Triton X-100 extracts of transfected HEK293 cells, resolved by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, CAIV recruitment to the position of AE1 suggested a physical interaction between CAIV and AE1. Gel overlay assays showed a specific interaction between CAIV and AE1, AE2, and AE3. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that the interaction between CAIV and AE1 occurs on the large fourth extracellular loop of AE1.

The physical association of CAII with AE localizes the site of substrate (HCO3−) production to the transport site, thus creating a transport metabolon. The CA·AE complex may also accelerate bicarbonate flux in part because of the increased CAII activity found upon interaction with its binding site on AE (11Scozzafava A. Supuran C.T. Bioorg. Med.

The two CA isoforms differ in their susceptibility to sulfonamide inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, with CAIV having an affinity up to 65-fold less than CAII (32Baird T.T., Jr. Waheed A. Okuyama T. Sly W.S. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CAIV is unique in that it contains two disulfide bonds that contribute to its stability in 5% SDS, a concentration of denaturant that inactivates CAII (33Okuyama T. Sato S. Zhu X.L.

Res. 1985; 19: 1033-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas membrane-bound CAIV localizes to the apical surface of cortical collecting ducts and α-intercalated cells (35Schwartz G.J. Kittelberger A.M. Barnhart D.A. Vijayakumar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F894-F904Google Scholar). CAIV plays a major role in bicarbonate reabsorption by the kidney (36Maren T.H. Conroy C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26233-26239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as modulating the pH in the tubule lumen (37Brechue W.F. Kinne-Saffran E. Kinne R.K. Maren T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1066: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CAIV is also found on the surface of pulmonary endothelial cells (23Whitney P.L. Briggle T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12056-12059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in the endothelial cells of an ocular capillary bed, where its presence suggests it may be the target for CA inhibitors that are used in the treatment of glaucoma (30Hageman G.S. Zhu X.L. Waheed A. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2716-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Despite general knowledge of co-localization of carbonic anhydrases and bicarbonate transporters, precise structural inter-relationships have remained largely unknown. The physiological importance of bicarbonate metabolism and transport led us to investigate the physical and functional relationship between AE proteins and CAIV. In this study we found a functional interaction between AE proteins and CAIV. Expression of CAIV had no effect on the bicarbonate transport rate in cells expressing AE1 and cytosolic CAII, because CAII maximizes the bicarbonate flux under these conditions. It was not possible to use inhibitors to block CAII function because any membrane-permeable CA inhibitor would access both extracellular CAIV and intracellular CAII. Thus we used a dominant-negative form of CAII to selectively neutralize the stimulatory effect of cytosolic CAII on AE transport activity and thereby examine the role of CAIV in AE-mediated bicarbonate transport activity. We found that like CAII, CAIV also accelerates AE-mediated bicarbonate transport activity. On the basis of co-migration on sucrose gradients, overlay assays, and GST pull-down assays we conclude that there is a physical association between extracellular CAIV and the integral membrane transport protein, AE1. The interaction occurs on the fourth extracellular loop of AE1. Taken together CAIV and AE functionally and physically interact to form the extracellular component of a bicarbonate transport metabolon, which potentiates AE-mediated bicarbonate transport. ECL chemiluminescent reagent, donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and Hyperfilm were fromAmersham Biosciences. Poly-l-lysine and nigericin were from Sigma. Molecular Probes BCECF-AM was from Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd. (Ontario, Canada). Glass coverslips were from Fisher. Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories rabbit anti-goat conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was from BioCan Scientific (Mississauga, Canada). An expression construct for the rabbit CAIV protein was received as a generous gift from George Schwartz (35Schwartz G.J. Kittelberger A.M. Barnhart D.A. Vijayakumar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F894-F904Google Scholar), and Carol Fierke provided the V143Y CAII cDNA (38Fierke C.A. Calderone T.L. Krebs J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11054-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Expression constructs for AE and CA proteins have been described previously (8Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A. Casey J.R.

Plasmid DNA for transfections was prepared using Qiagen columns (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Canada). AE and CA proteins were expressed by transient transfection of HEK293 cells (42Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 52: 59-72Crossref Scopus (3512) Google Scholar) using the calcium phosphate method (43Ruetz S. Lindsey A.E. Kopito R.R. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1993; 48: 193-200PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in an air/CO2(19:1) environment in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 5% (v/v) calf serum. Bacterial expression constructs encoding GST fusion proteins consisting of the cDNA for glutathione S-transferase fused to either cDNA corresponding to the third (amino acids 560–584, 5′-IFQDYPLQESYAPVVMKPKPQGPVP-3′) or fourth (amino acids 643–677, 5′-TYTQKLSVPDGLKVSNSSARGWVIHPLGLYNHFPK-3′) extracellular loop of rat AE1 were constructed. Using rat AE1 as a template, the forward and reverse primers, 5′-CGCGGATCCTGATTTTCCAGGACTACCCGCTAC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGGGCACGGGGCCCTGAGGTTT-3′, respectively, introduced aBamHI site at both ends of the amplified third loop. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and ligated into the pGEX-5X-P expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) digested in the same way to produce the GST-AE1EC3 construct. The forward and reverse primers, 5′-CGCGGATCCTGACCTACACGCAGAAACTCTCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCACTTGGGGAAATGGTTATACAG-3′, respectively, were used in the same manner to produce the fourth extracellular loop product (GST-AE1EC4). The GST-AE1EC3 and GST-AE1EC4 constructs were verified by sequencing with a Beckman Instruments CEQ2000 DNA sequencer, and plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen columns. The GST-AE1EC constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 and a single colony used to inoculate 50 ml of LB media. Following overnight growth at 37 °C with shaking this culture was used to inoculate 1.2 liters of LB media (5 ml/200 ml). The culture was grown at 37 °C with shaking until the A 600 was 0.6–1.0. Isopropylthiogalactoside (1 mm final) was added and growth was allowed to continue for 2–6 h. The culture was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and bacterial were pellets resuspended in cold PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 6.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4) containing protease inhibitors (complete mini-protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Suspended cells were disrupted by sonication (4 × 1 min) and inoculated with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) with slow stirring for 30 min. Following centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min) the supernatant was transferred to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (50% slurry equilibrated with PBS) (Amersham Biosciences) and allowed to incubate at room temperature with gentle agitation for 1–2 h. The sample was centrifuged (500 × g for 5 min) and the pellet was washed three times with PBS. The fusion proteins were eluted with glutathione buffer (10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). HEK293 cells, grown in 60-mm tissue culture dishes, were transiently transfected with a construct, pJRC9 (39Casey J.R. Ding Y. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), to induce expression of AE1 anion exchange protein as described above. Cells were also co-transfected with either pJRC36 or pDS14 (8Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47886-47894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) to induce expression of human wild-type and mutant CAII, respectively, and also with a construct to express rabbit CAIV (35Schwartz G.J. Kittelberger A.M. Barnhart D.A. Vijayakumar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F894-F904Google Scholar). Plasmids pBSL103 (40Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) encoded mouse AE2 and rat AE3 cardiac, respectively. Two days post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and lysates of the whole tissue culture cells were prepared by addition of 200 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (20% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 150 mm Tris, pH 6.8) containing, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 2 mm EDTA. Prior to analysis, samples were heated to 65 °C for 5 min and sheared through a 26-gauge needle (BD PharMingen). Insoluble material was then sedimented by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8 or 12.5% acrylamide gels (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes by electrophoresis for 1 h at 100 V at room temperature in buffer composed of 20% (v/v) methanol, 25 mm Tris, and 192 mm glycine (45Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). PVDF membranes were blocked by incubation for 1 h in TBST-M buffer (TBST buffer (0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and then incubated overnight in 10 ml of TBST-M containing 3 μl of 1658 rabbit anti-AE1 polyclonal antibody (46Tang X.B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), 3 μl of sheep anti-human CAII antibody (Serotec), or 3 μl of goat anti-rabbit CAIV antibody (35Schwartz G.J. Kittelberger A.M. Barnhart D.A. Vijayakumar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F894-F904Google Scholar). After washing with TBST buffer, blots were incubated for 1 h with 10 ml of TBST-M containing 1:3000 diluted donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Anti-CAII immunoblots were incubated with 1:3000 diluted donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and anti-CAIV immunoblots were incubated with 1:3000 diluted rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After washing with TBST buffer, blots were visualized and quantified using ECL reagent and a Kodak Image Station 440CF. Anion exchange activity was monitored using a fluorescence assay described previously (41Sterling D. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were transiently transfected. Two days post-transfection, coverslips were rinsed in serum-free DMEM and were incubated in 4 ml of serum-free media containing 2 μm BCECF-AM (37 °C for 15 min). Coverslips were then mounted in a fluorescence cuvette and were perfused alternately with Ringer's buffer (5 mmglucose, 5 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm calcium gluconate, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing either 140 mmNaCl or 140 mm sodium gluconate and bubbled with air/CO2 (19:1). Fluorescence was monitored using a Photon Technologies International RCR fluorimeter at excitation wavelengths of 440 and 502.5 nm and an emission wavelength of 528.7 nm. Following calibration using the high potassium nigericin technique (47Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar) at three pH values between 6.5 and 7.5, fluorescence ratios were converted to pH i . Rates of change of pH i were determined by linear regression (Kaleidagraph software) of the initial HCO3− efflux/influx and converted to rates of H+ equivalent flux across the plasma membrane according to the equation: JH+ = βtotal × ΔpH i (48Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar), where as determined previously βtotal = 57.5 mm (41Sterling D. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In all cases the transport activity of sham transfected cells was subtracted from the total rate to ensure that these rates consist only of the AE transport activity. HEK293 cells were transfected as described previously with cDNA encoding either AE1 or CAIV or co-transfected with both cDNAs. The method used to isolate glycosphingolipid-enriched lipid rafts was a modified version of the Brown and Rose protocol (49Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Two days post-transfection cells were incubated on ice in 2 ml of extraction buffer (140 mmNaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) with the protease inhibitors described above for 10 min. Samples were treated with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Then samples were made up to 4% sucrose by addition of an equal volume of 8% sucrose in extraction buffer without Triton X-100 and overlaid on 8 ml of 5–30% continuous sucrose gradients in which sucrose had also been dissolved in extraction buffer without Triton X-100. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 200,000 × g for 16–24 h at 4 °C and then 1-ml fractions were removed. A sample of each fraction was prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis by addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples of each fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8 or 12.5% acrylamide gels. Immunoblots were prepared and protein detected as described above. HEK293 cells grown in 60-mm culture dishes were transiently transfected individually with cDNA encoding AE1, AE2, AE3, or CAIV as described above. Two days post-transfection cells expressing an AE protein were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and cells expressing CAIV were solubilized in 200 μl of 0.2% (w/v) SDS supplemented with protease inhibitors. Samples were sheared and centrifuged as described above. Immunoblots of lysates of cells transfected with AE cDNA were prepared as described above. Immunoblots were blocked for 3 h with 10% TBST-M and then incubated overnight in 1% TBST-M containing 200 μl of the cell lysate prepared from CAIV-transfected cells. Immunoblots were then washed 4× 15 min in TBST and then probed for CAIV as described previously. GST fusion proteins of the third and fourth extracellular loop of AE1 were used in a GST pull-down assay. Briefly, 0.2 pmol of GST alone, GST-AE1EC3, or GST-AE1EC4 were bound to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose resin in 1.3 ml of solubilization buffer (1% (v/v) Igepal, 5 mm EDTA, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, supplemented with protease inhibitors (mini-complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cell lysates of sham or CAIV-transfected cells were prepared by solubilization of cells (60-mm dish of cells) in 200 μl of solubilization buffer. Lysates were applied to the resin and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Samples were centrifuged, 1000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. The resin was washed three times with PBS and the samples were eluted by heating at 75 °C for 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed for CAIV as described above. Values are expressed ± S.E. of measurement. Statistical significance was determined using a Student's paired t test with p < 0.05 considered significant. For functional assays, proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells. This cell line expresses endogenous CAII (8Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47886-47894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) yet undetectable levels of AE protein (13Kopito R.R. Lee B.S. Simmons D.M. Lindsey A.E. Morgans C.W. Schneider K. Cell. 1989; 59: 927-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). All cDNAs were inserted into either the pcDNA3.1 or pRBG4 (40Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) vector, which place them under the control of the cytomegalovirus early gene promoter. Cells were transiently co-transfected with cDNAs encoding AE1, the functionally inactive mutant V143Y CAII, and CAIV. Fig. 1 indicates that transient co-transfection of HEK293 cells with cDNAs encoding AE1, CAII, and CAIV results in expression of all three proteins. Cells transfected with vector alone showed no immunoreactivity with AE or CAIV antibodies but did indicate the presence of endogenous CAII at a level ∼20-fold lower than in CAII-transfected cells (not shown). CAIV on immunoblots frequently appeared as two bands. The source of this doublet is not clear but the difference in size is consistent with either two different glycosylated forms (35Schwartz G.J. Kittelberger A.M. Barnhart D.A. Vijayakumar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F894-F904Google Scholar) or from partial protein processing, leaving an uncleaved transmembrane anchor on the protein. To measure anion exchange activity, transiently transfected cells were grown on coverslips and loaded with BCECF-AM, a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye. The coverslips were placed in a fluorescence cuvette and perfused alternately with chloride-containing and chloride-free Ringer's buffer. In chloride-free Ringer's buffer, chloride leaves the cell and bicarbonate enters resulting in cell alkalinization. In chloride-containing Ringer's buffer, the opposite happens with chloride entering the cell in exchange for bicarbonate, leading to cell acidification. Following appropriate calibration using the high potassium nigericin technique (47Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak"
https://openalex.org/W2122218917,"Here we identify an 11-residue helical module in the unique N-terminal region of the cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4A1 that determines association with phospholipid bilayers and shows a profound selectivity for interaction with phosphatidic acid (PA). This module contains a core bilayer insertion unit that is formed by two tryptophan residues, Trp19 and Trp20, whose orientation is optimized for bilayer insertion by the Leu16:Val17 pairing. Ca2+, at submicromolar levels, interacts with Asp21 in this module and serves to gate bilayer insertion, which is completed within 10 ms. Selectivity for interaction with PA is suggested to be achieved primarily through the formation of a charge network of the form (Asp21−:Ca2+:PA2−:Lys24+) with overall neutrality at the bilayer surface. This novel phospholipid-binding domain, which we call TAPAS-1 (tryptophan anchoring phosphatidicacid selective-binding domain 1), is here identified as being responsible for membrane association of the PDE4A1 cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase. TAPAS-1 may not only serve as a paradigm for other PA-binding domains but also aid in detecting related phospholipid-binding domains and in generating simple chimeras for conferring membrane association and intracellular targeting on defined proteins.

For example, the localization of the RII subunits of PKA1 to distinct intracellular sites, achieved by binding to A-Kinase-Anchor Proteins (AKAPs), allows for the localized activation of this protein kinase and functionally compartmentalized signaling (1Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Activation of signaling processes themselves can lead to changes in the organization of intracellular proteins. This can take the form of protein-protein interactions, of which the SH2 and SH3 modules provide mechanistic and structural examples (2Mayer B.J. Gupta R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kimber M.S. Nachman J. Cunningham A.M. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Pai E.F. Mol.

However, more recently, lipid-directed re-organization of protein components within cells has been recognized, such as that seen in the binding of phosphoinositides to pleckstrin homology (PH) and FYVE domain modules, as well as the interaction of C2 domains with phospholipids (4Hurley J.H.

To appreciate the ways in which various signaling processes are connected in the cell, it is important to appreciate the range of protein modules that allow for interaction with intracellular anchors.Stimulation of many cells with a plethora of growth factors, cytokines, and hormones activates phospholipase D (PLD). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid (PA) which is presumed to mediate downstream signaling effects such as secretion, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal reorganization, apoptosis, and mitogenesis (6Liscovitch M.

PA has been reported to bind to and activate Raf-1, and a neutrophil PA-regulated protein kinase has been described (9Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

In particular, no module akin to either the pleckstrin homology or the FYVE domains involved in selectively binding 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides or the C2 domains that are able to bind certain phospholipid molecules (5Ferguson K.M.

Each isoform is characterized by a unique N-terminal region that is believed to be involved with intracellular targeting and complex formation. Thus the N-terminal regions of the PDE4A4/5 and PDE4D4 isoforms confer interaction with the SH3 domains of the Src family tyrosyl kinases (25McPhee I. Yarwood S.J. Huston E. Scotland G. Beard M.B.

However, the PDE4A1 isoform is unique in that its specific N-terminal region, which is encoded by a single exon (31Sullivan M. Rena G. Begg F. Gordon L. Olsen A.S. Houslay M.D. Biochem.

TAPAS1 consists of a bilayer insertion module that shows selectivity for interaction with PA and whose interaction with lipid bilayers is gated by Ca2+ binding to a single aspartate residue.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTotal Lipid AnalysisLipid Extraction500 ng of 12:0/12:0-phosphatidic acid (sodium salt) was added to each sample as internal standard, followed by 1.5 ml of methanol. This was transferred to a glass screw-capped tube, then 3 ml of chloroform was added, mixed, and left to stand for 10 min. 1.5 ml of 0.88% KCl in 0.1 m HCl was added, mixed, and left to split into two phases. The upper aqueous phase was discarded, whereas the lower organic phase containing the total lipids was washed with 1.5 ml of synthetic upper phase (methanol, 0.88% KCl in 0.1 m HCl, 1:1, v/v). The lower phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in 15 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), transferred into an autosampler vial, and stored at −20 °C until analysis.LC-MS AnalysisTotal lipid extracts in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were separated and characterized by LC-MS (QP8000alpha, Shimadzu) using 1-μl injection volumes onto a Luna silica column (3 μm, 1.0 × 150 mm; Phenomenex) with a solvent gradient of 100% chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia solution (90:9.5:0.5:0.32, by volume) changing to 100% chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia solution (50:48:2:0.32, by volume) over 40 min at 0.1 ml/min. Detection (nitrogen flow, 4l/min; curved desolvation line temperature, 300 °C; probe voltage, ±4.5 kV) in negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mode allowed characterization of phosphatidylbutanol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine, whereas detection in positive ESI mode enabled characterization of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. This has been described in some detail previously (36Pettitt T.R. McDermott M. Saqib K.M. Shimwell N. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Preparation of Lipid VesiclesPhospholipids (Avanti) were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1) and dried in a glass tube under oxygen-free nitrogen gas. Lipids were then resuspended by repeat pipetting in 1 ml of vesicle buffer (12.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 200 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Lipid suspensions were thawed in a 40 °C water bath, resuspended once again, and snap frozen. This procedure was repeated 10 times to produce multilamellar liposomes that were reduced in size by extrusion through a Lipsofast extruder (Avestin, USA) containing a polycarbonate filter with defined pores of 100 nm (37MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Liposomes were stored at 4 °C and used within 48 h of manufacture. Total lipid analysis of the extruded liposomes showed that they had the same composition as the mixtures used to generate them (<3% difference).Preparation of P2 FractionThis was done as described before by us in various studies (25McPhee I.

Culture medium was aspirated and cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Following a final wash with KHEM buffer (50 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), the cells were snap frozen. The cells were then thawed and passed 10 times through a fine gauge needle (26.5 gauge) to lyse. Cell fractions were first subjected to a low speed spin (1,000 × gfor 10 min, P1 fraction) and the S1 supernatant taken for a high speed spin (100,000 × g for 60 min) to yield the P2 pellet fraction. This was normally resuspended in complete KHEM. However, in experiments where the effect of Ca2+ on membrane association was explored, then P2 membranes were prepared in KHEM lacking CaCl2 and the P2 fraction was washed 2 further times in Ca2+-free KHEM.Sedimentation Assays using TnT Synthesized CAT ChimeraNT-4A1-CAT mutants were synthesized using the Single Tube Protein System 3 (Novagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were synthesized in vitro and labeled with [35S]methionine. They were then used in binding assays being allowed to bind to P2 fractions in KHEM buffer or to liposomes in vesicle buffer, as described in some detail previously by us (33Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Smith K.J. Scotland G. Beattie J. Trayer I.P. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16703-16711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, for transcription, 8 μl of STP3 SP6 transcription mixture was added to 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA and the volume adjusted to 10 μl with H2O. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. To this mixture, 4 μl of [35S]methionine (AmershamBiosciences) (40 μCi), 30 μl of STP3 translation mixture, and 6 μl of H2O were added. After mixing, the translation reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 60 min. For membrane binding assays, 1 μl of this mixture was added to 60 μg of P2 fraction in KHEM (200 μl) at 4 °C and mixed. After 30 min the P2 fraction was pelleted as before (100,000 × g for 30 min). The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was washed twice in KHEM and resuspended in an identical volume to the supernatant. Liposome binding assays used a similar protocol. 1 μl of the TnT translation mixture was added to 200 μl of liposomes in vesicle buffer. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min before being centrifuged as for the P2 fractions. The supernatants were collected and the pellets were resuspended in volumes equal to the supernatants, after the pellet had been washed twice in vesicle buffer. Supernatants and pellets from both assays were run on bis-Tris NuPage 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) using MES buffer (Invitrogen). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a FujiBas phosphorimager and quantification of the radioactive bands corresponding to CAT and its chimeric constructs was done using the FujiBas software. Background subtraction was done by standard analysis of adjacent blocks. As described before in some detail (33Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Smith K.J. Scotland G. Beattie J. Trayer I.P. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16703-16711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), CAT served as an internal control for non-membrane bound material contaminating the pelleted P2 fraction. This was routinely <4% total. For assays done with complete KHEM, including Ca2+, then free Ca2+ was in the range 27–30 μm.Analysis of the Binding of Recombinant PDE4A-GST Chimera by Surface Plasmon ResonanceSurface plasmon resonance was performed using a Biacore 3000 and HPA chips (Biacore UK). Supported lipid monolayers were prepared essentially as previously described (41Hodgkin M.N. Masson M.R. Powner D. Saqib K.M. Ponting C.P. Wakelam M.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 43-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, small unilammelar vesicles were prepared to a final concentration of 300 μmphosphatidylcholine in buffer by extrusion through a 100-nm filter. Other phospholipids, as indicated, were added to small unilammelar vesicles to give a final concentration of 10 mol %. HPA surface plasmon resonance chips were pre-cleaned with octylglucoside (2%) and supported lipid monolayers were formed by injection of small unilammelar vesicles at 3 μl/min in SPR running buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2). Supported lipid monolayers were treated with bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml) and subjected to acid cycling prior to assessing the binding of NT-4A1-GST proteins. Binding specificity experiments were performed at 20 and 3 μl/min by injecting NT-4A1-GST and control proteins into the flowing buffer at final concentrations of 1 and 5 μm. Results are representative of several experiments for the binding of NT-4A1-GST and GST alone.Transfection of COS1 CellsCOS1 cells were maintained and transfected essentially as described previously by us (42Huston E. Pooley L. Julien J. Scotland G. McPhee I. Sullivan M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31334-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). COS1 cells were seeded at ∼33% confluency onto 10-cm diameter plates. Immediately before transfection the culture medium was replaced with 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum together with 0.1 mm chloroquine. 10 μg of DNA was diluted to 250 μl with TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) and 200 μl of 10 mg/ml DEAE dextran was then added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before addition to the culture medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 3–4 h before the medium was aspirated and the cells shocked for 2 min with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in a phosphate-buffered saline solution. The culture was then rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline solution before Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 72 h. Disruption of cells and the isolation of particulate and high speed supernatant fractions is described above based upon our previous studies (25McPhee I. Yarwood S.J. Huston E. Scotland G. Beard M.B.

All mutagenesis and deletion constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Full-length PDE4A1Full-length PDE4A1 (GenBankTM accession number M26715)(43Davis R.L. Takayasu H. Eberwine M. Myres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3604-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was used. This was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector for COS1 cell expression studies, either with or without a HA epitope tag at its extreme C terminus.NT-4A1-CAT ConstructsWe have described previously in some detail (33Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) a modified version of the pBLCAT2 plasmid containing the CAT gene of the Tn9 plasmid, which has fused, in-frame, a region encoding the first 25 amino acids of PDE4A1. This allows for the generation of a chimeric form of CAT that has the first 25 amino acids of PDE4A1 at its N terminus. The Sp6 promoter in this plasmid was used to drive the coupled transcription translation reaction.NT-4A1-GFPThe N-terminal first 25 amino acids of PDE4A1 (RD1) were cloned as an in-frame fusion with the GFP gene in the vector pEGFP-N1, via the KpnI/BamHI sites. The methionine residue at the start of EGFP was then mutated to alanine. This was done to prevent “false” initiation, at this point because of a preceding weak Kozak sequence, as occurred with the NT-4A1-CAT constructs (33Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Smith K.J. Scotland G. Beattie J. Trayer I.P. Houslay M.D. J. Biol.

This modified construct was then used as the template for all GFP mutations and deletions in NT-4A1-GFP.NT-4A1-GSTThe N-terminal first 25 amino acids of PDE4A1 (RD1), which had been generated by PCR, were cloned as an in-frame fusion with GST in pGEX-3X-1, via the BamHI/EcoRI sites. This construct was then used as the template for generating all the NT-4A1-GST mutations. ARF1 as an HA epitope-tagged form was a kind gift from Dr. R. Lefkowitz (Duke University, Durham, NC).Purification of GST Fusion ProteinsPurification of GST or MBP fusion proteins was carried out as described in Ref. 45Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5035) Google Scholar. Briefly, frozen aliquots of bacteria expressing GST fusion proteins were thawed at room temperature and then held on ice and sonicated for 100 s in 20-s pulses, separated by 20-s intervals. Bacterial debris was then pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 9,000 × g in a refrigerated centrifuge and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were equilibrated by washing twice with 20 bed volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with 10 bed volumes of complete phosphate-buffered saline (containing 1 mmdithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture). The equilibrated beads were added to the sonicated bacterial supernatant (200 μl bed volume of Sepharose beads per 4 ml of supernatant) and incubated end over end at 4 °C for 2 h. Following incubation, the beads were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm in a Jouan C312 “swing-out” centrifuge and the supernatant was discarded. The beads were washed 4 times with 10 bed volumes of ice-cold complete phosphate-buffered saline per wash. Each wash step was carried out end over end for 30 min at 4 °C. Incubating the beads with 1 bed volume of elution buffer 3 times at 4 °C for 15 min allowed for fusion protein elution. This procedure routinely generated a homogeneous preparation (>96% purity on SDS-PAGE). However, in some instances the above extract was subjected to a further purification by ion-exchange chromatography using a Mono Q column on a Bio-Rad Biologic system using a gradient of NaCl to elute.Membrane Binding Assay using GST Fusion ProteinsIn a total volume of 100 μl a P2 pellet (1 mg/ml) fraction in complete KHEM buffer was mixed with the appropriate GST fusion protein or GST itself (50 μg/ml). The free Ca2+ was in the range 26–30 μm. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min they were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were washed three times with 200 μl of complete, ice-cold KHEM buffer before analysis. This was done by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes and visualization using an anti-GST polyclonal antibody.Thermal Denaturation ExperimentsThis was done essentially as described before (46Marchmont R.J. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but here with samples (50 μl) of COS1 cell membranes (P2 fraction; 25 μg) in KHEM buffer (with protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated at the indicated temperature for the indicated times before being removed to ice for rapid cooling prior to use in binding assay. For protease sensitivity experiments, P2 membranes (20 μl; 27 μg) in buffer without protease inhibitors, were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 10 μl of protease (0.5 mg/ml; chymotrypsin, V8, or trypsin). Membranes were then harvested by centrifugation, as above, before being resuspended in 200 μl of KHEM buffer containing complete inhibitor mixture together with added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mm), 3,4-dichlorocumarin (10 nm), Pefabloc SC (10 mm), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml). They were then subjected to a further round of harvesting before final resuspension in 200 μl of KHEM buffer, containing the above listed protease inhibitors, and used in the binding assay described above.Fluorescence MeasurementsTime-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out in anApplied Photophysics (London, UK) SX.18MV stopped-flow instrument, operated at 20 °C, essentially as we have described for other proteins (47Walmsley A.R. Baldwin S.A. Membrane Transport. 7. IRL Press, Oxford2000: 167-189Google Scholar). For measurements of the change in tryptophan fluorescence, the samples were excited with light at 285 nm, selected with a monochromator, and the emission monitored at wavelengths above 335 nm, using a cut-off filter. Invariably, equal volumes of the reactants were mixed together in the stopped-flow instrument, using two syringes of equal volume. The final concentration of the 25-mer peptide reflecting"

Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibition of protein phosphatases by okadaic acid (OA) increase phosphorylation of DAT and lead to concomitant reduction in DAT activity and cell surface expression. Numerous potential sites for phosphorylation are present on DAT, but the sites utilized and their relationship to transport regulation are currently unknown. We used peptide mapping and epitope-specific immunoprecipitation to identify the region of DAT that undergoes phosphorylation in rat striatal tissue. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that basal and stimulated samples were phosphorylated primarily on serine. Digestion of32PO4-labeled DAT with trypsin and immunoprecipitation with N- or C-terminal specific antisera failed to isolate phosphopeptide fragments corresponding to photoaffinity-labeled fragments that contain all internal interhelical loops. However, digestion of 32PO4-labeled DAT with endoproteinase asp-N and immunoprecipitation with an N-terminal antiserum extracted two phosphopeptide fragments from both basal and PKC/OA-stimulated samples, demonstrating that the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail is a major site of phosphorylation. Aminopeptidase treatment of PKC- and/or OA-stimulated DAT cleaved essentially all32PO4 label without proteolysis extending past transmembrane domains 1 and 2, providing further evidence that most phosphorylation sites are near the N terminus and not in intracellular loops or C-terminal domains. In situ proteolysis of the N-terminal tail indicates that the majority of stimulated phosphorylation sites are N-terminal to an antibody epitope at residues 42–59. Two-dimensional analysis of purified protein produced three tryptic phosphopeptides that may result from phosphorylation of multiple sites, but the fragments did not co-migrate with synthetic tryptic peptides phosphorylated at serines 2 and 4.

Phorbol esters stimulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of DAT that results in intracellular sequestration and trafficking through recycling and degradative pathways (12Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J.

However, it is not known if phosphorylation of DAT is required for these processes and/or contributes to other aspects of transport regulation or function.Our current goal is to identify the sites of phosphorylation on DAT and elucidate their functional significance. The presumed intracellular aspects of rDAT contain numerous serines, threonines, and tyrosines, many of which are present in PKC, protein kinase A, and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase consensus motifs (Fig. 1). These residues are found in both N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tails and in all intracellular loops (ILs) except IL1. The large number of potential phosphorylation sites, in conjunction with the possibility of multisite phosphorylation, has made determination of phosphorylation sites by molecular approaches problematic. Attempts to identify sites contributing to regulation of DAT, GAT1, and Glyt1 using mutagenesis of PKC consensus motifs and/or sites highly conserved throughout the neurotransmitter transporter family have not been successful (14Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sato K. Adams R. Betz H. Schloss P. J.

Neurochem. 2001; 77: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as phorbol ester-induced regulation was maintained after mutagenesis. It is possible that the sites examined were not those involved in phosphorylation or that multiple sites are involved, and mutagenesis of the examined sites was insufficient to produce a result.In this study we used phosphoamino acid analysis and protease-based peptide mapping strategies to identify directly the region of DAT that undergoes phosphorylation in rat brain tissue. The results show that one or more serines at the extreme end of the N-terminal tail are the major sites of both basal and stimulated phosphorylation. These results have implications for the molecular basis of transport regulation and provide strong direction for mutagenesis approaches.DISCUSSIONAlthough DAT has now been characterized as a phosphorylated protein in several studies, many questions remain regarding its properties and significance. For example, it is not known if basal phosphorylation is mediated by PKC or other kinases or if PKC-induced phosphorylation is due to direct phosphorylation of DAT by PKC or by activation of an intermediate kinase. It is also not known if OA-stimulated phosphorylation represents accumulation of basal phosphorylation via direct inhibition of DAT phosphatase(s) or if OA stimulates phosphorylation by an indirect mechanism. Multiple electrophoretic mobility isoforms of DAT can be visualized on SDS gels; this is most easily observed in immunoblots (23Thompson A.C. Zapata A. Justice J.B., Jr. Vaughan R.A. Sharpe L.G. Shippenberg T.S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but is also apparent at times by photoaffinity labeling and phosphorylation. We do not know if these electrophoretic mobility isoforms are caused by heterogeneous phosphorylation, glycosylation, or other factors. Western blotting of immunoprecipitated 32PO4-labeled DAT demonstrates substantial overlap between both signals, 2R. A. Vaughan, unpublished results. indicating that most bands visualized by immunostaining are phosphorylated. However, in some but not all experiments PMA or OA stimulation results in an upward shift of the phosphorylated band or concentration of32PO4 radiolabeling near the trailing edge of the DAT complex (5Vaughan R.A. Huff R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15541-15546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), but we do not know if this indicates preferential phosphorylation of some isoforms. Clarification of these issues will clarify our understanding of the role of phosphorylation in DAT physiology and function.The goal of this study was to determine which regions of DAT undergo phosphorylation in brain tissue. For this purpose we characterized DAT phosphorylation in rat striatal slices, finding that phosphate incorporation was stimulated by PKC activators and PP1/PP2A inhibitors, as in synaptosomes and cells, and was sufficiently robust for additional sample manipulation. These preparations were therefore suitable for phosphopeptide mapping analyses with correlation to our previous findings of DAT functional regulation.For all basal and stimulated conditions, we found that DAT is phosphorylated primarily on serine, indicating the potential for these residues to be major determinants of DAT properties regulated by kinases and phosphatases. In addition, a low level of phosphothreonine was consistently observed, and many threonines are found within PKC consensus sequences that are highly conserved throughout the monoamine transporter family (2Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Recent studies (9Law R.M. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Doolen S. Zahniser N.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 931-938PubMed Google Scholar, 25Simon J.R. Bare D.J. Ghetti B. Richter J.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 224: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have reported the presence of phosphotyrosine on GAT1 and the functional regulation of DAT and GAT1 by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We found no detectable phosphotyrosine from DATs prepared under the described conditions, but we did not employ treatments such as tyrosine kinase activators or phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitors specific for generation or preservation of phosphotyrosine.Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the N-terminal tail of DAT is the major, and possibly sole, domain that undergoes basal, PKC-induced, and OA-induced phosphorylation in rat striatum. Basal and OA/OAG-stimulated 32PO4-labeled asp-N fragments were immunoprecipitated with N-terminal antiserum 16, and aminopeptidase but not carboxypeptidase removed PKC- and/or OA-stimulated 32PO4 label from DAT without proteolysis extending past TMs 1–2. In conjunction with the inability to immunoprecipitate tryptic or asp-N-phosphorylated fragments with C-terminal antisera, these results indicate that the N terminus of DAT is the primary site of basal, PKC-stimulated, and OA-stimulated32PO4 incorporation.In situ proteolysis of the N-terminal tail strongly implicates the region N-terminal to antibody epitope 16 (residues 42–59), as opposed to more internal regions, as the major site of stimulated phosphorylation. The distal end of the N-terminal tail contains 6 serines, some closely spaced, within the first 21 residues. The stoichiometry of DAT phosphorylation is unknown, and within this cluster of serines we do not know which combination of sites is utilized. PKC consensus motifs are present at Ser-7 and Ser-21, although it is not known if PKC phosphorylates DAT directly or acts by an indirect mechanism that would lead to phosphorylation at non-canonical sites. We also do not know if phosphorylation induced by PKC activators and phosphatase inhibitors occurs on the same, different, or overlapping sites within this domain. Limit digestion of phosphorylated DAT with trypsin produced two low molecular weight phosphopeptides, but because of the number of serines, lysines, and arginines in the N-terminal tail, we cannot determine whether the fragments represent distinct or overlapping peptides. The major endogenous phosphopeptides did not co-migrate with synthetic phosphopeptides representing tryptic digests of the first five rDAT residues containing serines 2 and 4, potential evidence that these sites are not phosphorylated. Digestion with CNBr also failed to generate a phosphorylated fragment consistent with cleavage at Met-11 that would contain serines 2, 4, and 7. Taken together, all of our results are compatible with phosphorylation of DAT occurring on some combination of serines 12, 13, and 21, but evidence from additional strategies will be required to identify definitively the sites utilized. Our current efforts are directed toward the use of mutagenesis and mass spectrometry to address these questions.To our knowledge these results are the first to demonstrate phosphorylation of a neurotransmitter transporter on the N-terminal domain. A recent study (16Chang M.Y. Lee S.H. Kim J.H. Lee K.H. Kim Y.S. Son H. Lee Y.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that serine to glycine mutagenesis of residues Ser-262 in IL2 and Ser-586 and Thr-613 in the C-terminal tail of human DAT (corresponding to Ser-261, Ser-585, and Thr-612 of rDAT) resulted in the loss of PMA-stimulated phosphorylation. These results directly conflict with our results that positively demonstrate the presence of phosphorylation sites on the N-terminal tail after stimulation by PMA alone or with OA/OAG together and show no evidence for PKC-stimulated phosphorylation in IL2 or the C-terminal tail. The discrepancies could result from methodological differences, as the mutagenesis study examined human DAT expressed in a cell line, whereas our mapping was done using the rat isoform phosphorylated in striatal tissue. The positions of serines and threonines in the N-terminal tail of rat and human DAT are very similar, with serines in both isoforms at positions 2, 4, 7, 12, 13, and 45 and threonines at positions 43, 46, and 62. Differences are present at residues 21 (Ser in rat and Pro in human), 44 (Asn in rat and Ser in human), 48 (Asn in rat and Thr in human), 53 (Thr in rat and Ser in human), and 64 (Ser in rat and Gly in human). Alternatively, the mutations may have induced secondary effects on protein conformation that indirectly prevented N-terminal domain phosphorylation.The potential for similarities of our results to phosphorylation sites and PKC-dependent regulation of other plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters is not known. The N-terminal tail of SERT has 7 serines and 10 threonines, some within PKC consensus sites, but phosphorylation site analysis of SERT has not yet been reported. Interestingly, norepinephrine, which displays PKC-dependent and -independent functional regulation (26Apparsundaram S. Galli A. DeFelice L.J. Hartzell H.C. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 733-743PubMed Google Scholar), has three threonines but no serines in its N-terminal domain. Our results differ from the phosphorylation pattern found for synaptic vesicle acetylcholine and monoamine transporters, which undergo phosphorylation exclusively on C-terminal tail residues (27Cho G.W.

Edwards R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6752-6759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the case of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, mutation of serine 480 resulted in altered intracellular sorting that may impact neurotransmitter packaging (29Krantz D.E. Waites C. Oorschot V. Liu Y. Wilson R.I. Tan P.K. Klumperman J. Edwards R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This difference in phosphorylation patterns of plasma membrane and vesicular neurotransmitter transporters may indicate the potential for these classes of proteins to be subject to different molecular mechanisms of kinase-induced regulation.The finding that basal, PKC-stimulated, and OA-stimulated DAT phosphorylation all occur on N-terminal serines is compatible with basal phosphorylation resulting from tonic PKC and PP1/PP2A action, which may function to define base-line dopamine clearance. DAT dephosphorylation in the brain is extremely robust and may serve to regulate tightly the DAT phosphorylation state and functional activity (30Vaughan R.A. Reith M.E.A. Cerebral Signal Transduction: From First to Fourth Messengers. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 375-400Google Scholar). DATs are found in complexes with PP2A (31Bauman A.L. Apparsundaram S. Ramamoorthy S. Wadzinski B.E. Vaughan R.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7571-7578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and undergo in vitro dephosphorylation by PP1 (32Vaughan R.A. Pananusorn B. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2001; 27: 1865Google Scholar), and regulation of basal and stimulated DAT phosphorylation may occur through physiological control of these phosphatases as well as through activation of kinases.At present, the function of DAT phosphorylation is not known. A correlation exists between the dose and kinetics of PKC- and OA-induced DAT phosphorylation, down-regulation, and transporter internalization (5Vaughan R.A. Huff R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol.

(Lond.). 2000; 525: 11-19Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Transporter phosphorylation could serve as a marker for recruitment of endocytic adaptor proteins in a manner analogous to that of G protein-coupled receptors (34Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Other potential functions of phosphorylation could include recognition by other targeting proteins or involvement in an autoregulatory mechanism. For example, the N terminus of GAT1 interacts with the solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptor protein syntaxin 1 in a PKC-specific manner that results in regulation of γ-aminobutyric acid transport (35Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Deken S.L. Beckman M.L. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat.

Biol. 2001; 18: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), although it is not known if this is mediated by GAT1 phosphorylation. Recent evidence also indicates the potential for DAT and SERT to exist as dimers or oligomers (38Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 39Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Our current efforts are aimed at mutating N-terminal DAT serines to assess their usage as phosphorylation sites and examine their involvement in down-regulation and other processes. The concentration of dopamine in the synaptic and extrasynaptic space is controlled to a great extent by the action of dopamine transporters (DATs),1 which utilize the energy of Na+ and Cl− ionic gradients to drive reuptake of the neurotransmitter into the presynaptic cell (1Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). DAT belongs to a family of transporters including those for norepinephrine and serotonin (SERT) that constitutes the major sites of action for tricyclic antidepressants and psychostimulants (2Amara S.G.

This step is regulated by a nonclassical NF-κB signaling pathway involving the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). NIK induces p100 processing by triggering phosphorylation of specific C-terminal serines of p100. However, the downstream molecular events leading to p100 processing remain unclear. Here we show that NIK induced the physical recruitment of β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, to p100. This event required the phosphorylation sites as well as the death domain of p100. Using the RNA interference technique, we demonstrated that β-TrCP is essential for NIK-induced p100 ubiquitination and processing.

Mammalian cells have five NF-κB proteins, RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52, which function as various homo- and heterodimers (7Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). In most cell types, the NF-κB factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm through physical interaction with specific ankyrin repeat-containing inhibitors, including IκBα and homologues (8Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). The latent forms of NF-κB can be activated by a large variety of chemical, environmental, and microbial agents, which act by inducing the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα (9Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 10Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M., Qi, X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This canonical NF-κB signaling pathway depends on a multisubunit IκB kinase (IKK),1 which is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (also named NEMO, IKKαP1, or FIP-3) (11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). When activated by upstream signals, IKK directly catalyzes the phosphorylation of IκBα at two specific serines, which in turn triggers its ubiquitination. Recent biochemical studies suggest that the β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP, also named E3RSIκB) is involved in the ubiquitination of phosphorylated IκBα, although genetic evidence is lacking (11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Another level of NF-κB regulation is via processing of the NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 precursor proteins p105 and p100, a proteasome-mediated event required for generating p50 and p52, respectively (7Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 12Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Both p105 and p100 contain ankyrin repeats at their C-terminal portions and function as IκB-like NF-κB inhibitors by forming cytoplasmic complexes with mature NF-κB subunits (13Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 14Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, the processing of p105 and p100 also serves to liberate the sequestered NF-κB members. It seems clear that the processing of p105 is largely a constitutive event (11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar), while the processing of p100 is tightly controlled by both negative and positive regulatory mechanisms (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of p100 contains a death domain (DD) that functions as a processing-inhibitory domain (PID). Mutant forms of p100 lacking the PID undergo constitutive processing. Interestingly, in some lymphoma cells, the nfκb2 gene is involved in chromosomal translocations that produce C-terminal truncation mutants of p100 lacking the PID, and at least some of these p100 mutants have been shown to undergo constitutive processing (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that deregulated processing of p100 may contribute to the development of lymphoid malignancies. The processing of wild type p100 can be induced by a noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway involving the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). NIK induces p100 phosphorylation at specific C-terminal serines, which serves as a trigger for its inducible processing. Consistently anik gene mutation in the alymphoplasia mice is associated with the absence of p100 processing, resulting in severe deficiencies in lymphoid organ development (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). More recent studies suggest that NIK induces p100 phosphorylation through a downstream kinase, IKKα (16Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Kraehn G. Greten F. Chen Y., Hu, Y. Fong A. Sun S.-C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Interestingly IKKα is also involved in p100 processing induced by the retroviral oncoprotein Tax (17Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, IKKβ, which is essential for the canonical NF-κB signaling, is completely dispensable for the inducible processing of p100 (16Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Kraehn G. Greten F. Chen Y., Hu, Y. Fong A. Sun S.-C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 17Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). These findings reveal a novel signaling pathway specifically regulating the processing of p100, which is essential for the development and maturation of lymphoid organs. While it is clear that phosphorylation triggers the processing of p100, the downstream molecular events involved in this signaling process remain poorly defined. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of p100 ubiquitination and the role of this posttranslational modification in regulating p100 processing. Using the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene suppression technique, we have demonstrated that β-TrCP is an essential component involved in NIK-induced ubiquitination of p100. In NIK-expressing cells, β-TrCP forms a stable complex with p100 but not with a p100 mutant lacking its phosphorylation site. We further demonstrate that β-TrCP-mediated p100 ubiquitination is essential for inducible, but not constitutive, processing of p100. Expression vectors encoding NIK and derivatives, p100 and derivatives, and HA-ubiquitin have been described (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 17Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To construct the HA-tagged β-TrCP, the β-TrCP cDNA from Jurkat T cells was amplified by RT-PCR and inserted into the pcDNA-HA vector (18Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22911-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The β-TrCPiR is a mutant harboring sense mutations in the siRNA targeting site that prevent the binding and degradation by the specific siRNA. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, 3F10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The antibody recognizing the N terminus of p100 (anti-p100) was kindly provided by Dr. W. C. Greene (19Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). siRNA for human β-TrCP and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sequences of β-TrCP siRNA are: GUG GAA UUU GUG GAA CAU CTT (sense) and GAU GUU CCA CAA AUU CCA CTT (antisense). The sequences of GFP siRNA are: GCU ACC UGU UCC AUG GCC ATT (sense) and UGG CCA UGG AAC AGG UAG CTT. Transfection of 293 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were seeded into six-well plates 12–16 h prior to transfection. About 0.6 nmol of the β-TrCP siRNA was mixed with 800 ng of carrier DNA (pcDNA) and transfected into the 293 cells in 2 ml of culturing medium. 24 h later, the same transfection was performed to achieve high efficiency gene suppression. 24 h following the second siRNA transfection, DNA expression vectors encoding p100 and the other indicated proteins were transfected into the cells. Protein extracts and RNA were prepared at 24–30 h after the DNA transfection. The efficiency of β-TrCP gene suppression was monitored by RT-PCR. 293 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran (20Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (17Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The cell lysates (about 7 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and IB as described previously (21Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). CoIP assays (using 250 μg of cell lysates) were performed as described previously (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected in six-well plates with HA-ubiquitin and p100 together with the indicated expression vectors. About 30 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and immediately subjected to IP using anti-p100. The agarose beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and the attached proteins were eluted in SDS loading buffer. The eluted ubiquitin-conjugated p100 was analyzed by IB using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA. As described earlier (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), the inducible processing of p100 is associated with its ubiquitination, although it remains unclear whether this is an essential step in p100 processing. Additionally the ubiquitin ligase regulating p100 ubiquitination remains to be identified. We investigated the role of βTrCP in the processing of p100 using siRNA-mediated gene suppression. As expected from various other studies (22Caplen N.J. Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 49-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Luo X. Tang Z. Rizo J. Yu H. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 59-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), the β-TrCP siRNA efficiently depleted the mRNA of βTrCP but not that of a control gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, as detected by the sensitive RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1 A). More importantly the β-TrCP suppression led to almost complete blockade of NIK-induced p100 processing. This effect was specific since the processing of p100 was not affected in cells transfected with the control GFP siRNA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5–8). Furthermore the β-TrCP RNAi was also able to inhibit NIK-induced processing of endogenous p100 (Fig. 1 C). These results provide genetic evidence for an essential role of β-TrCP in the inducible processing of p100. With the RNAi genetic approach, we were also able to determine whether β-TrCP is essential for proteolysis of IκBα. For these studies, we expressed HA-tagged IκBα with a constitutively activated form of IKKβ (IKKβSS/EE). IKKβSS/EE efficiently induced degradation of IκBα (Fig. 1 D, lane 2); however, the inducible degradation of IκBα was completely blocked in cells transfected with the β-TrCP siRNA (lane 4). We next examined whether β-TrCP is required for the ubiquitination of p100. When expressed in 293 cells, NIK efficiently induced polyubiquitination of p100 as evidenced by the formation of ubiquitin-conjugated heterogeneous p100 adducts (Fig.2 A, lane 2). Remarkably the p100 polyubiquitination was largely abrogated when β-TrCP gene expression was suppressed by RNAi (lane 4). Moreover the RNAi-mediated inhibition of p100 ubiquitination was associated with the marked diminishment of NIK-induced p100 processing (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). To further confirm the inhibitory effect of β-TrCP siRNA was specifically caused by the loss of β-TrCP, functional rescue was performed by transfecting the siRNA-treated cells with a β-TrCP mutant harboring sense mutations in the siRNA targeting site (RNAi-resistant β-TrCP or βTrCPiR). As shown in Fig. 2, both the ubiquitination and the processing of p100 were efficiently restored in cells expressing the RNAi-resistant form of β-TrCP (Fig. 2, A andB, lane 6). Thus, β-TrCP is an essential component for regulating the ubiquitination of p100. We then examined whether β-TrCP physically interacts with p100 by coIP assays. When expressed in 293 cells, β-TrCP only weakly interacted with p100 in the absence of the processing-inducing kinase NIK (Fig.3 A, top panel,lane 1). However, in the presence of NIK, β-TrCP formed a stable complex with p100 and was readily coprecipitated by the p100 antibody (lane 2). In contrast, a catalytically inactive NIK mutant (NIK(K429A/K430A)) failed to induce the binding of β-TrCP to p100. This functional difference was not due to variation in protein expression since similar amounts of NIK and NIK mutant were detected by immunoblotting in the cell lysates (Fig. 3 A,middle panel). The levels of β-TrCP (middle panel) and p100 (bottom panel) were also comparable in the different cell transfectants. Furthermore the NIK-induced p100/β-TrCP interaction was tightly associated with the induction of p100 processing (bottom panel). Finally the molecular interaction between β-TrCP and p100 appeared to be strong since β-TrCP also formed a stable complex with endogenous p100 in the presence of NIK (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Since NIK, but not NIK(K429A/K430A), is unable to induce p100 phosphorylation (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the phosphorylation site of p100 might be required for β-TrCP recognition. This idea was tested by performing the coIP assays using a p100 mutant (p100SS/AA, see Ref. 15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) harboring serine to alanine mutations at its phosphorylation site. As expected, the p100SS/AA did not respond to NIK for processing (Fig.3 C, bottom panel, lane 5). More importantly this p100 mutant also failed to interact with β-TrCP (top panel, lane 5) or become polyubiquitinated (data not shown and Ref. 15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) in NIK-expressing cells. These findings strongly suggest the direct involvement of β-TrCP in catalyzing the polyubiquitination of p100. We have previously shown that a DD located in the C-terminal region of p100 functions to suppress the constitutive processing of p100. Mutant forms of p100 harboring a DD deletion (p100ΔDD) or C-terminal truncations undergo constitutive processing (Ref. 15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar and Fig. 4 B). It has remained unclear how the constitutive processing of p100 is mediated. One possibility we considered was that the constitutively processed p100 mutants bind to β-TrCP independently of NIK. This idea was tested by coIP assays using β-TrCP and p100ΔDD or a p100 C-terminal truncation mutant lacking the DD and additional C-terminal sequences (p100-(1–454)). To our surprise, neither p100ΔDD nor p100-(1–454) was able to bind β-TrCP (Fig. 4 A,lanes 4 and 6) even when NIK was expressed in the cells (lanes 5 and 7). Consistently NIK did not enhance the constitutive processing of the p100 mutants (Fig.4 B, lanes 4 and 6) but markedly induced the processing of the wild type NIK (lane 2). This result prompted us to determine whether β-TrCP is required for p100 constitutive processing. In sharp contrast to the results obtained with the inducible processing of p100, the constitutive processing of p100-(1–454) was not affected by RNAi-mediated β-TrCP gene suppression (Fig. 4 C, lanes 5 and 6). Similar results were obtained with the p100ΔDD (data not shown). Thus, the constitutive processing of p100 appears to be independent of β-TrCP. Processing of the nfκb2 gene product, p100, to generate p52 is an important step of NF-κB regulation, which is specifically involved in the development and maturation of secondary lymphoid organs. Emerging evidence suggests that the mechanism of p100 processing differs from that regulating signal-induced degradation of the labile NF-κB inhibitor IκBα. Our previous studies using the alymphoplasia mice clearly demonstrate an essential role for the NIK kinase in regulating p100 processing in lymphoid organs (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). On the other hand, NIK is not required for cytokine-stimulated degradation of IκBα or the nuclear translocation of the prototypical form of NF-κB (RelA/p50) (25Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K. Serikawa T. Honjo T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 26Yin L., Wu, L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Further studies reveal that IKKβ, which is critical for the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, is dispensable for NIK-induced p100 processing, while IKKα is an essential component of the NIK/p100 pathway (16Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Kraehn G. Greten F. Chen Y., Hu, Y. Fong A. Sun S.-C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). We have now extended the previous studies by investigating the mechanism of p100 polyubiquitination and its role in p100 processing. Using the powerful siRNA-mediated gene suppression technique, we have provided genetic evidence for the critical involvement of β-TrCP in p100 polyubiquitination (Fig.2 A). Furthermore inhibition of p100 ubiquitination in β-TrCP-deficient cells results in blockade of the inducible processing of p100 (Figs. 1 B and 2 B). These findings suggest that polyubiquitination of p100 is mediated through the β-TrCP-specific ubiquitin ligase and serves as an essential step in the inducible p100 processing. Prior studies using a dominant-negative β-TrCP mutant suggest that β-TrCP also participates in ubiquitination of several other proteins, including IκBα, p105, human immunodeficiency virus Vpu, and β-catenin (11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). With the siRNA technique, we can now determine whether β-TrCP is essential for the ubiquitination and proteolysis of each of the putative target proteins. Our RNAi studies have confirmed the essential role of β-TrCP in IKKβ-induced degradation of IκBα (Fig. 1 D) and p105 (data not shown). A conserved site for β-TrCP binding, containing phosphorylated serines and flanking residues, has been found in the various putative β-TrCP targets (Ref. 11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar; see Fig. 5). The β-TrCP binding site in p100 contains most, although not all, of the conserved amino acid residues found in the other proteins (Fig. 5). Mutation of the two conserved serines to alanines within this site in p100 completely abolished its ability to bind β-TrCP (Fig.3 C). Interestingly, in addition to the C-terminal phosphorylation site, the DD of p100 is required for its interaction with β-TrCP (Fig. 4 A). Consistent with this finding, the p100 mutant lacking the DD is defective in ubiquitination (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that p100 mutants lacking the C-terminal DD undergo constitutive processing (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Interestingly the processing of these mutants is independent of β-TrCP. Consistently these mutants do not physically interact with β-TrCP. This finding suggests two possibilities regarding how the constitutive processing of p100 is regulated. First, the N-terminal region of p100 may interact with another yet to be identified ubiquitin ligase, which targets p100 mutants for constitutive ubiquitination and proteasome recruitment. Second, the constitutive processing of p100 may not involve ubiquitination. In favor of the second possibility, we have been unable to detect polyubiquitination of the constitutively processed forms of p100 using the in vivo ubiquitination method (Ref. 15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar and data not shown). Although these results cannot exclude the possibility for involvement of weak ubiquitination in the constitutive processing of p100 mutants, it nevertheless suggests that strong polyubiquitination is specifically required for the inducible processing of p100. We thank Dr. Warner Greene for reagents and members of the Sun laboratory for discussion of the work."
https://openalex.org/W1975109489,"Conversion of the normal membrane-bound prion protein (PrP-sen) to its pathological isoform (PrP-res) is a key event in the pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Although the subcellular sites of conversion are poorly characterized, several lines of evidence have suggested the involvement of membrane lipid rafts in the conversion process. Here we report that copper stimulates the endocytosis of PrP-sen via a caveolin-dependent pathway in both microglia and neuroblastoma cells. We show that the polyene antibiotic filipin both limits endocytosis of PrP-sen and dramatically reduces the amount of membrane-bound PrP-sen. This reduction results from a rapid and massive release of full matured PrP-sen into the culture medium. Finally, we demonstrate that filipin is a potent inhibitor of PrP-res formation into chronically infected neuroblastoma cells. Our results reinforce the role of rafts in PrP trafficking and raise the possibility that the release of PrP-sen from the plasma membrane decreases the amount of available substrate PrP-sen at the conversion sites."

Because anoikis resistance plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis, here we examined whether HGF suppressed suspension-induced apoptosis (anoikis) in HNSCC cells, and if so, we assessed downstream signaling pathways mediated by HGF. We found that HNSCC cells underwent anoikis upon loss of matrix contact, whereas HGF provided protection against it. HGF-induced anoikis resistance was found to be dependent on both ERK and Akt signaling pathways. The inhibition of either ERK or Akt activation abolished HGF-mediated survival. Furthermore, we found that HGF did not activate NFκB transcription in HNSCC cells and that HGF-mediated anoikis resistance was independent of NFκB.

Kmiecik T.E. Vande Woude G.F. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 802-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). It is well known that HGF activates two important kinase cascades, the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways (4Jeffers M.

The activation of ERK is mediated by a cascade of phosphorylation events. Activated ERK can phosphorylate a variety of substrates including transcription factors, kinases, and phosphatases (11Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv.

The activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to play an important role in cell survival induced by growth factors and oncogenes. Multiple pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins have been shown to be modified by the activation of Akt (10Bowers D.C. Fan S. Walter K. Abounder R. Williams J.A. Rosen E.M. Laterra J.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Additionally, HGF activates the stress-responsive transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NFκB), in several human cancer cell lines (16Müller M. Morotti A. Ponzetto C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1060-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). NFκB transcriptionally regulates a broad spectrum of genes that play an important role in cell cycle progression, survival, and inflammation (17Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev.

Importantly, growing evidence has demonstrated that the expression of HGF and/or c-Met plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis (4Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). c-Met/HGF is found to be overexpressed in various human cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (4Jeffers M.

Clinical studies have found that the c-Met protein expression level was inversely correlated with survival in patients with large-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (22Qian C. Guo X. Cao B. Kort E.J.

Serum HGF in head and neck cancer patients was significantly increased compared with healthy control subjects (19Uchida D. Kawamata H. Omotehara F. Nakashiro K. Kimura-Yanagawa T. Hino S. Begum N.M.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5911-5918PubMed Google Scholar). HGF strongly induces the expression of angiogenic factors interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor in HNSCC cells, suggesting that HGF promotes tumor development by induction of angiogenesis (20Dong G. Chen Z., Li, Z. Yeh N.T. Bancroft C.C. Van Waes C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5911-5918PubMed Google Scholar). Matsumotoet al. (24Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that HGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and promoted the migration and invasion by oral SCC cells (24Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, an increase of c-Met has been found in lymph node metastases of HNSCC compared with primary tumors, which suggested that the Met receptor HGF ligand signaling may play a critical role in promoting the metastasis of HNSCC (25Cortesina G. Martone T. Galeazzi E. Olivero M. Stefani A.D. Bussi M. Valente G. Comoglio P.M. Renzo F.D. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 89: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, several rodent and human model systems have demonstrated that Met-HGF signaling induces metastatic behavior in vivoby stimulating cell invasion and angiogenesis (4Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 26Rong S. Segal S. Anver M. Resau J.H. Vande Woude G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 14417-14422Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition to gaining functions of invasion and angiogenesis, cell resistance to anoikis also appears to play an important role in tumor progression and metastasis as tumor cells lose matrix attachment during metastasis (28Frisch S.M. Screaton R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Anoikis, also known as suspension-induced apoptosis, is a term used to describe programmed cell death (apoptosis) of epithelial cells induced by loss of matrix attachment. This process is important for maintaining normal cell and tissue homeostasis (28Frisch S.M. Screaton R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Anoikis frequently occurs in adult organisms during regeneration of skin or colonic epithelia or during involution of the mammary gland following weaning (28Frisch S.M. Screaton R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 29Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Rytomaa M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5488-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The precise signaling cascade that links caspase activation and cell adhesion has not been elucidated. Recently, the death receptor signaling pathway has been found to be required for the induction of anoikis. The expression of a dominant-negative mutant of FAS-associated death domain protein, FADD, blocks caspase activation in anoikis (29Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Gaining anoikis resistance or anchorage-independent survival is a hallmark of oncogenic transformation. For example, oncogenic Ras has been shown to confer resistance to anoikis in epithelial cells and to promote anchorage-independent growth. The ERK signaling pathway or the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has been found to inhibit a loss of contact-induced apoptosis in rat intestinal cells or Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (28Frisch S.M. Screaton R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 33McFall A. Ulku A. Lambert Q.T. Kusa A. Rogers-Graham K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5488-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although significant progress has been made in understanding apoptotic signaling mediated by chemotherapeutic drugs and irradiation, little is known regarding regulation of anoikis by growth factors. Moreover, many studies on anoikis are performed in primary or immobilized rodent cells, which may be irrelevant to human cancers (28Frisch S.M. Screaton R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 29Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 30Rytomaa M.

Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5488-5499Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Given the fact that the inhibition of anoikis is critical for tumor metastasis because tumor cells lack appropriate cell matrix contacts while traversing the blood and lymph system during metastasis, new findings involved in the regulation of anoikis of human tumor cells may provide new insight into mechanisms of tumor metastasis. Because c-Met-HGF signaling is clinically associated with metastasis of HNSCC cells (24Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31807-31813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cortesina G. Martone T. Galeazzi E. Olivero M. Stefani A.D. Bussi M. Valente G. Comoglio P.M. Renzo F.D. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 89: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we performed experiments to determine whether HGF provided protection against apoptosis induced by a loss of matrix attachment. We found that HNSCC cells underwent apoptosis when placed in suspension growth conditions, whereas HGF provided potent protection against it. To explore the molecular mechanisms by which HGF inhibited anoikis, the activation of ERK, Akt, and NFκB by HGF was evaluated in HNSCC cells. We found that HGF-induced anoikis resistance was dependent on both ERK and Akt signaling pathways. The inhibition of either ERK or Akt with a specific chemical inhibitor was sufficient to abolish HGF-mediated anoikis resistance. Moreover, we found that in contrast to other cell types HGF could not stimulate NFκB transcription in HNSCC cells and that HGF-mediated survival was independent of NFκB. Taken together, our results suggest that the inhibition of HNSCC cell anoikis appears to be one of the mechanisms by which HGF promotes HNSCC metastasis. Human HNSCC cell lines HNSCC1, HNSCC23, and HNSCC14A were derived from SCC of the head, neck, and oral cavity at The University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 unit/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Chemical inhibitors used in this study for MEK1/2 (U0126) were purchased from Promega, and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem. Retroviruses were generated by transfecting the retroviral construct encoding super-repressor IκBα (SR-IκBα) into 293T cells by the calcium phosphate method. The retrovirus-containing supernatant was harvested 48 h later and stored at −70 °C. To stably express SR-IκBα, cells were infected with retroviruses in the presence of 6 μg/ml polybrene. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were selected with puromycin (1.5 μg/ml) for 1 week. The resistant clones were pooled and confirmed by Western blot analysis. For induction of anoikis, cells were plated on 0.6% soft agar with or without HGF (40 ng/ml) (R&D Systems) in the presence of growth medium as described previously (34Orford K.C. Ford C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). 48–72 h after cell suspension, the cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and any cell aggregates were dispersed by trypsinization. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion analysis. For cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, cell supernatants were collected and incubated with monoclonal antibodies against DNA and histone according to the manufacturer instructions. The reaction was measured with a plate reader at the wavelength of 405 nm. To examine DNA laddering, cells were lysed, and the soluble fraction was extracted with phenol-chloroform (Fisher Scientific). Fragmented DNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel as described previously (35Mayo M.W. Wang C.-Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted. Whole cell lysates were prepared with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1:100 protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma). The protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). The protein extracts were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, 1× TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, 125 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C and probed with primary antibodies for 1 h and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. The immune complexes were visualized using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to protocol of the manufacturer. For internal control, the blots were stripped with Tris buffer (62.5 mm, pH 8.0) containing 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS at 60 °C for 1 h and reprobed with an anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody. Primary antibodies were purchased from the following commercial sources. Polyclonal phospho-specific antibodies against ERK1/2 (1:1000), Akt (1:1000), and IκBα were from Cell Signaling. Monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin (1:7500) were from Sigma, and secondary antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG (1:7500) were from Promega. 0.5 × 105 cells were plated in 6-well plates in triplicates. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the recommendations by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Plasmids were mixed with LipofectAMINE (1:4 ratio) in Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen), and complexes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For internal control, pRL-TK Renila luciferase reporter was co-transfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. The DNA-LipofectAMINE mixtures were added to the cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were replenished with fresh medium. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with HGF for an additional 24 h. Cells were then washed with 1× ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase system (Promega). For EMSA, cells were treated with TNF (20 ng/ml), HGF (40 ng/ml), or TNF plus HGF for the indicated times. Nuclear protein extraction and EMSA were performed as described previously (40Wang C.-Y. Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To induce anoikis, HNSCC1 cells were cultured on a cushion of 0.6% agar to prevent cell attachment as described previously (34Orford K.C. Ford C. Byers S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, a loss of cell adhesion strongly induced DNA fragmentation and histone release in HNSCC1 cells as determined by cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In contrast, significantly less DNA fragmentation and histone release (over 3-fold) was detected when HNSCC1 cells were treated with HGF. Through trypan blue exclusion assay, we found that over 70% of cells were dead 72 h after a loss-of-matrix contact, but only 30% of cells treated with HGF were dead. Because some dead cells were rapidly lysed, the percentage of cell death in HNSCC1 without HGF treatment might be underscored. To further confirm that induction of anoikis in HNSCC1 cells was through the activation of an apoptotic program, we also isolated genomic DNA to examine the DNA laddering, a hallmark of apoptosis (36Green D. Reed J. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar), by agarose gel analysis. As shown in Fig.1 C, HGF stimulation also significantly inhibited the formation of DNA laddering. Additionally, we also determined whether HGF suppressed anoikis in other HNSCC cell lines. As shown in Fig.2, A and B, HGF stimulation rescued both HNSCC14A and HNSCC23 cells from anoikis, respectively. Taken together, our results demonstrated that HGF provided protection against cell detachment-induced apoptosis.Figure 2HGF inhibits anoikis in HNSCC14A and HNSCC23 cells. A, HGF rescued HNSCC14A cells from anoikis. The induction of anoikis and HGF treatment were performed as described in Fig. 1 A. Cell viability was determined with the trypan blue exclusion assay.

Morotti A. Ponzetto C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1060-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). NFκB is an important transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation and survival (17Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) that NFκB plays an important role in the inhibition of TNF-mediated apoptosis. Because the death receptor signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in anoikis (39Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, 30Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we questioned whether HGF-mediated protection was dependent on NFκB activation. First, we determined whether HGF stimulated NFκB activation in HNSCC cells. Under most unstimulated conditions, NFκB is retained in the cytoplasm by IκB inhibitory family proteins. Upon stimulation, the IκB kinase complex is activated to phosphorylate IκBα, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα. The liberated NFκB is then translocated to the nucleus where it activates gene transcription (17Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 18Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1999; 58: I2-I13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because IκB kinase activation plays an essential role in NFκB activation, we performed Western blot analysis to examine IκB kinase-mediated IκBα phosphorylation following HGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3 A, top panel, no significant phosphorylation of IκBα was detected following HGF treatment. Also, HGF treatment did not induce IκBα degradation (Fig. 3 A, middle panel). As a positive control, TNF treatment rapidly induced the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, HGF treatment did not stimulate NFκB reporter activity (Fig.3 B), indicating that HGF did not modify NFκB transcription. The results above suggest that HGF-mediated protection is independent of NFκB. As a further confirmation, we established an HNSCC1 cell line (HNSCC1I) stably expressing NFκB inhibitor, SR-IκBα, by retroviral transduction (Fig. 3 C). A control cell line (HNSCC1V) expressing empty vector was also obtained. Because SR-IκBα was FLAG-tagged, the molecular weight of SR-IκBα was slightly larger than that of endogenous IκBα. SR-IκBα, which contains two mutations at serine 32 and serine 36, cannot be phosphorylated by the IκB kinase complex and subsequently degraded by proteasomes, thereby preventing the nuclear translocation of NFκB. The inhibition of NFκB by SR-IκBα renders various cell types sensitive to TNF-mediated apoptosis (39Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, 40Wang C.-Y. Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Nat.

Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). Because the promoter of IκBα is regulated by NFκB, the expression of SR-IκBα significantly reduced the expression of endogenous IκBα (Fig.3 C). Consistent with our previous studies (40Wang C.-Y.

Interestingly, the pretreatment with HGF significantly blocked TNF killing in HNSCC1I cells, indicating that HGF-mediated protection against TNF killing was independent of NFκB (Fig. 3 D). To demonstrate that HGF or TNF was unable to activate NFκB in HNSCC1I cells, EMSA was performed. As shown in Fig.4 A, TNF rapidly induced the nuclear translocation of NFκB in control cells (HNSCC1V) but not in HNSCC1I cells (compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6). EMSA supershifts confirmed the specificity of the NFκB-containing complex (data not shown). HGF or HGF plus TNF stimulation failed to induce the nuclear translocation of NFκB in UM-SCC1I cells (lanes 7–10). Moreover, the NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter assay verified that HGF, TNF, or TNF plus HGF did not activate NFκB transcription in HNSCC1I cells (Fig. 4 B). Finally, we examined whether HGF could inhibit anoikis in HNSCC1I cells. As shown in Fig. 4 C, HGF stimulation suppressed anoikis in both HNSCC1V and HNSCC1I cells at the similar level. Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of anoikis by HGF was independent of NFκB activation. We next examined whether the ERK or PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was involved in HGF-mediated inhibition of anoikis in HNSCC cells, because HGF activated ERK and Akt in several human cancer cell lines including"

Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that the empty pore of the translocon complex is permeable to small ions and neutral molecules (15Simon S.M. Blobel G. Zimmerberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, to avoid the profound regulatory effects of cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+] C ) on Ca2+release channels (20Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar), [Ca2+] in the solution bathing the ER was “clamped” at a quasi-resting level (∼90 nm) by dialyzing the cell with a mixture of calcium and the Ca2+chelator BAPTA. This provides a particularly sensitive method for studying very slow Ca2+ fluxes.Using this experimental approach we have set out to study the following: (i) the depletion of [Ca2+] ER by physiological doses of CCK and ACh, (ii) the relative magnitudes of the basal Ca2+leak and the Ca2+ leak stimulated by physiological doses of agonists, (iii) the contribution of IP3 and ryanodine receptors to agonist-evoked and basal Ca2+ leak, and (iv) the effect on [Ca2+] ER on the dissociation of nascent polypeptide chains from the ribosome with puromycin.RESULTSFollowing permeabilization of the plasma membrane or whole-cell dialysis of dye-loaded pancreatic acinar cells, the ratio of fluorescence at 340 to 380 nm rose as cytosolic dye was washed out (8Mogami H. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In 51 fura-FF-loaded patch-clamped cells, the mean ratio in the basolateral non-nuclear area after dialysis was 0.63 ± 0.03, corresponding to a mean apparent [Ca2+] ER of 80 μm.Physiological Concentrations of Cholecystokinin Deplete [Ca2+]ERCCK (CCK-8, sulfated form) generated stepwise decreases in ratio, but at picomolar concentrations of the agonist the ratio reached the new steady-state level relatively slowly.

Sci. 1995; 89: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), there was a small but detectable decrease in ratio (Fig. 1). In 7 cells the mean decrease was 0.014 ± 0.003 (Fig. 2). However at 10 pm CCK, a concentration seen in the plasma after a meal, there was a more substantial mean decrease in ratio of 0.043 ± 0.006 (13 cells). The CCK-induced decreases in ratio were uniform throughout the basolateral non-nuclear area of the cell, where the resting ratio was highest. 10 nm CCK evoked a large average decrease in the ratio of 0.142 ± 0.005 (Fig. 2).Figure 2Mean decreases in ratio (± S.E.) evoked by CCK and ACh in cells dialyzed with control BAPTA/Ca2+intracellular solution and in cells dialyzed with intracellular solution containing heparin.

The decrease in the ratio evoked by ACh was most pronounced in the basal area of the cell and was uniform in this region. In other regions of the cell including the lateral and apical regions, ratio decreases had similar time courses but slightly smaller amplitudes (Fig. 3 B). The EC50 for the ACh-evoked decrease in ratio was 0.98 ± 0.06 μm(Fig. 3 C). In 10 cells 10 μm ACh gave a mean decrease in ratio of 0.135 ± 0.024; this was similar in size to the decrease evoked by 10 nm CCK (Fig. 2). In the presence of a supramaximal concentration of ACh, 10 nm CCK was unable to cause further depletion of [Ca2+] ER (n = 5, data not shown).Figure 3Depletion of [Ca2+] ER by different doses of ACh in dialyzed cells.

This is consistent with the unmasking of the basal leak of Ca2+ from intracellular stores following inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. Thapsigargin (2 μm) evoked a quantitatively similar depletion of [Ca2+] ER (data not shown). The mean rate of decrease evoked by CPA in 14 cells was 0.018 ± 0.006 min−1, much smaller than the rate of decrease of the ratio due to 10 μm ACh (0.15 ± 0.02 min−1, n = 8). When 10 pm CCK was applied to cells in which the basal leak had already been revealed by CPA treatment the mean rate of Ca2+ loss was accelerated (Fig. 4). The decreases in the ratio evoked by CPA and CCK were greatest in the basolateral area; slightly smaller decreases with similar kinetics were seen throughout the cell (Fig. 4). In 7 cells, 10 pm CCK significantly increased (p < 0.05, paired Student's t test) the mean rate of decline evoked by CPA (by 265 ± 82%), whereas in 6 cells 1 pm CCK increased the CPA-evoked rate of decline by only 10 ± 20%.Figure 4Relative magnitudes of the basal Ca2+ leak revealed by CPA and the Ca2+ leak evoked by a physiological concentration of CCK in a dialyzed acinar cell.

Heparin substantially blocked the response to ACh (Fig.5 A), and in 10 cells dialyzed with heparin the response to 10 μm ACh was decreased by 80% compared with control cells (Figs. 2 and 5 A). Heparin did not completely block the effect of CCK (Fig. 5 A). In heparin-dialyzed cells the mean response to 10 nm CCK was not different from the mean response in control cells (Figs. 2 and5 A); however the effect of 10 pm CCK was more than halved by heparin (Fig. 2). In heparin-dialyzed cells CPA was still able to reveal the basal leak (0.012 ± 0.005 min−1, n = 4) and deplete [Ca2+] ER (Fig. 5 B). We also studied the effects of another receptor antagonist flunarizine (10 μm) on agonist-evoked and basal Ca2+ release. In our study this compound, which is membrane-permeant and has been previously reported to block directly the Ca2+ channel of the IP3 receptor (27Seiler S.M. Arnold A.J. Stanton H.C. Biochem.

Pflügers Arch. 1998; 435: 746-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), had no effect on mean resting [Ca2+] ER (mean ratio = 0.67 ± 0.08 in the presence of 8-amino-cyclic ADP-ribose, n = 7) or on the action of ACh, but blocked the depletion of [Ca2+] ER by 10 pm CCK (Fig. 6 A). In 5 cells dialyzed with this inhibitor the mean ratio decrease evoked by 10 pm CCK was reduced by 87 ± 11% (p < 0.02 compared with control cells). In the presence of 8-amino-cyclic ADP-ribose, CPA was still able to deplete the Ca2+ store at a rate similar to in control conditions (0.02 ± 0.009 min−1, n = 4). Inhibition of CPA responses by 8-amino-cyclic ADP-ribose was not seen even when the IP3 receptor blocker flunarizine was present as well (n = 4). In order to investigate further whether the basal leak could occur through the ryanodine receptor we studied the effect on the basal leak of ruthenium red, a blocker of the ryanodine receptor (20Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 31Palade P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6135-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments were performed on permeabilized cells, allowing relatively fast and simple changes of the solutions in contact with the ER. In 16 permeabilized cells CPA (10 μm) evoked a mean ratio decrease of 0.021 ± 0.004 min−1, but ruthenium red (10 μm) had no effect on this basal leak (Fig. 6 B). We also studied the effect of nifedipine and verapamil (both 100 μm) on the basal Ca2+ leak in permeabilized cells. It has been reported that in sea urchin eggs these Ca2+ channel blockers completely inhibit the release of stored Ca2+evoked by NAADP (32Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but we found that in the pancreatic acinar cell they had no effect on the basal Ca2+ leak evoked by CPA (n = 8 cells for both compounds, data not shown).Figure 6Effects of inhibitors of ryanodine receptors on the response to CCK and on the basal leak. A, in a patch-clamped cell dialyzed with 8-NH2 cyclic ADP-ribose (20 μm) the store-depleting effect of physiological dose of CCK (10 pm) is inhibited, but CPA (10 μm) is still able to reveal the basal leak. B, in a streptolysin O-permeabilized cell, the basal leak evoked by CPA is not affected by the ryanodine receptor blocker ruthenium red (RR, 10 μm). Subsequently, [Ca2+] ER is depleted by a mixture of ionomycin (10 μm) and EGTA (10 mm) (Iono).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Puromycin Evokes a Decrease in [Ca2+]ERIn patch-clamped and dialyzed cells the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin (100–500 μm) produced an initial decrease in ratio, which slowed down after a short period (Fig.7 A). Mean fura-2FF ratio decreases with 100 and 500 μm puromycin were 0.08 ± 0.02 and 0.167 ± 0.04, respectively (10 cells). Ratio measurements in acinar cells loaded with the low-affinity Ca2+ indicator mag-fura-2 and dialyzed with BAPTA/Ca2+ intracellular solution confirmed the ability of puromycin to deplete [Ca2+] ER (n = 4; data not shown). We also studied the effects of puromycin in fura-2FF-loaded acinar cells permeabilized by streptolysin O, because this allowed faster changes of bathing solution during the experiment. Responses to puromycin were seen in permeabilized cells (Fig. 7 B), and the mean ratio decrease evoked by 500 μm puromycin was 0.11 ± 0.02 (n = 16), and by 1 mm puromycin 0.14 ± 0.03 (n = 7). At 20 μm, puromycin had no effect (n = 4). To exclude the possibility that the effects of puromycin were mediated via agonist-activated Ca2+ release channels, we applied puromycin to permeabilized cells during blockade of IP3 and ryanodine receptors. In the presence of the IP3 receptor inhibitor heparin (500 μg/ml), puromycin (500 μm) decreased the mean ratio of 10 permeabilized cells by 0.091 ± 0.015 (Fig.8 A), and in the presence of the ryanodine receptor antagonist ruthenium red (10 μm) puromycin decreased the mean ratio of 8 permeabilized cells by 0.074 ± 0.019 (Fig. 8 B). Neither of these values was significantly different from the effect of puromycin alone. To investigate the possibility that the depletion of [Ca2+] ER by puromycin could be because of a decreased activity of the SERCA pump rather than an increase in Ca2+ permeability of the ER membrane, we studied the effect of puromycin on [Ca2+] ER when SERCA was inhibited by CPA. Puromycin (500 μm) accelerated the Ca2+ leak evoked by CPA (Fig 8 C). In 36 cells the mean Ca2+ leak was increased from 0.013 ± 0.002 to 0.018 ± 0.002 (p < 0.01, paired Student'st test).Figure 7Time courses of depletion of [Ca2+] ER by puromycin. A, puromycin (100 and 500 μm) depletes [Ca2+] ER in a dialyzed cell.

C, in a permeabilized cell in which inhibition of the SERCA pump by CPA (10 μm) activates the basal Ca2+ leak, puromycin (500 μm) accelerates the depletion of [Ca2+] ER . Subsequent application of a mixture of ionomycin (10 μm) and EGTA (10 mm) (Iono/EGTA) further depletes the Ca2+ store.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study we were able to dissociate the effects of physiological doses of agonists on the initial or intrinsic Ca2+ efflux from the ER from any effects on Ca2+ signaling due to secondary Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. This was achieved by direct measurements of [Ca2+] ER while [Ca2+] C was clamped at a quasi-resting level with a BAPTA/Ca2+ mixture. In these highly sensitive experimental conditions, where feedback of Ca2+ on its own efflux was prevented, we were able to resolve the depletion of [Ca2+] ER produced by the hormone CCK at 1 pm (the fasting plasma level), and at 10 pm, a level achieved in the plasma after a meal. 1 and 10 pm CCK produced ratio changes corresponding to ∼10 and 32% of the decrease induced by a supramaximal dose of CCK, respectively. Our experiments indicate that SERCA pumps can balance the leak induced by all doses of CCK in the physiological range and prevent substantial depletion of the store. This is important because substantial depletion of ER can inhibit protein synthesis, facilitate protein degradation and affect protein folding (33Stevens F.J. Argon Y Semin. Cell Dev.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) in HeLa cells has indicated that overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 can decrease the Ca2+ content of the ER, suggesting that this protein could mediate (or regulate) Ca2+ leak from the ER. Moreover, this study implies a new “trophic” action of low physiological doses of Ca2+-releasing hormones,i.e. protection of the ER from Ca2+ overload and consequently from apoptotic destruction of the cell.Previous measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ have indicated that in intact cells physiological concentrations of CCK generate, after a delay of 1–2 min, a mixture of fast, local spikes and slow global Ca2+ oscillations (5Cancela J.M.

Our study describes an increase of the permeability of the ER that is purely due to action of the hormone (without amplification by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release). The mechanism by which moderate increases in Ca2+ efflux from the ER are converted into different forms of Ca2+ oscillation by other cellular mechanisms is an interesting subject for further theoretical and experimental studies. For ACh the physiological concentration range in the vicinity of the pancreatic acinus is unknown, therefore we have characterized the effects of a broad range of ACh concentration on [Ca2+] ER . The ability of low doses of ACh (10 and 100 nm) to generate a pattern of short lasting local Ca2+ spikes similar to that produced by IP3 infusion into patch-clamped cells (6Petersen O.H. J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) has been well characterized (5Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H.

Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Our measurements of [Ca2+] ER suggest that 10 and 100 nm ACh cause between 13 and 25% of the maximal agonist-dependent ratio changes, respectively. The depletion of [Ca2+] ER induced by these doses of ACh, and by physiological doses of CCK, is clearly quantitatively similar. Therefore the difference in the patterns of cytosolic Ca2+ responses of the two agonists cannot simply be explained by different levels of Ca2+ efflux from the ER.In this study we found that the ability of ACh to induce Ca2+ leak from the ER was blocked by heparin, a competitive IP3 receptor antagonist (40Ghosh T.K. Eis P.S. Mullaney J.M. Ebert C.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11075-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and by flunarizine, which does not affect IP3 binding to its receptor but blocks the Ca2+ release channel activated by IP3 (27Seiler S.M.

Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 673-680PubMed Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the primary mechanism of ACh-induced Ca2+ leak is mediated by IP3 receptors.In contrast, the role of IP3 receptors in acinar cell Ca2+ signaling by CCK is more complex.

https://openalex.org/W2106745747,"Rab11-FIP2 is a recently described member of the Rip11/Rab11-FIP/Rab coupling protein family of Rab11 interacting proteins. Rab11-FIP2 interacts with both Rab11 and myosin Vb and co-localizes with Rab11 in both HeLa and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Hales, C. M., Griner, R., Hobdy-Henderson, K. C., Dorn, M. C., Hardy, D., Kumar, R., Navarre, J., Chan, E. K., Lapierre, L. A., and Goldenring, J. R. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 39067–390751). Here, we characterized the specificity of the interaction between Rab11-FIP2 and Rab11 and report that it does not interact with Rab4, Rab3, Rab5, Rab6, or Rab7. We demonstrate that the COOH-terminal region of Rab11-FIP2, which contains the Rab11 binding domain (RBD), is necessary and sufficient for its early endosomal membrane association. In contrast, the amino-terminal region, which contains a phospholipid binding C2-domain, by itself was insufficient for membrane binding. Expression of a deletion mutant of Rab11-FIP2, containing the RBD, caused tubulation of a transferrin receptor-positive early endosomal compartment in HeLa cells. Endogenous Rab11 was also associated with this compartment. This phenotype cannot be reversed by excess wild-type Rab11, or dominant-positive Rab11 (Rab11Q70L), suggesting that Rab11-FIP2 functions downstream of Rab11 in endosomal trafficking.

This fundamental process is controlled by a complex array of cellular proteins, including SNARE1 proteins and their regulators, coat proteins such as clathrin, adaptor, and COP complexes, and small GTPases such as the members of the ARF and Rab families (2Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). The two major directions of intracellular traffic controlled by these proteins are the secretory (biosynthetic) and endocytic pathways. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is a process by which ligands bind to specific cell surface receptors that have accumulated in clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane. These pits are internalized as coated vesicles and transported to the early sorting endosome, to which they fuse after uncoating (3Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The receptor-ligand complex uncouples, due to a shift in pH, and the cargo and receptor are then sorted for their next transport step (4Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Membrane-associated molecules and receptors such as the transferrin receptor (TfnR) and transferrin (Tfn) are transported back to the plasma membrane either via the endosomal recycling compartment or in a “fast” cycle directly from the early sorting endosome (5Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Strickland D.K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The endosomal recycling compartment is located in the perinuclear region of the cell, close to the microtubule-organizing center, where its structure is maintained by microtubules (6Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The Rab family of small GTPases function to regulate different intracellular trafficking pathways. Each Rab GTPase is thought to regulate the budding, trafficking, and fusion of transport vesicles along discrete transport steps (7Goud B. McCaffrey M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Rab4 and Rab11 have both been shown to function in endocytic recycling. Rab4 has been localized to the early endosomes, and studies on Tfn recycling in cells expressing mutant forms of Rab4 have implicated it in the regulation of membrane receptor recycling (10van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Goud B. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6313-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Rab4 also affects traffic to the degradative pathway (12McCaffrey M. Bielli A. Cantalupo G. Mora S. Roberti V. Santillo M. Drummond F. Bucci C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Rab11 is localized to the endosomal recycling compartment where it is thought to regulate transport to the plasma membrane (13Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Rab11 is also found associated with thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) and has been reported to regulate trafficking between the endosomal compartment and the TGN (14Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which Rab GTPases perform their regulatory roles are still poorly understood. An important method for elucidating their functions is to identify the proteins with which they interact. A number of Rab interacting proteins have been identified to date, and it is estimated that each Rab GTPase may have up to 20 different cellular effectors (2Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar, 15McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In an attempt to characterize the role of Rab11 in endocytic membrane trafficking, several groups have set about identifying and characterizing Rab11 interacting proteins. The first Rab11 interacting partners to be isolated were Rab11BP/Rabphilin-11 (16Zeng J. Ren M. Gravotta D., De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P., Xu, G. Shen T.H.

These proteins have low overall homology but possess two functional and well conserved domains, an α-helical coiled-coil domain at their COOH terminus, that encompasses the Rab binding domain (RBD) (20Prekeris R.

To date, six members of this family have been identified: Rab11-FIP1, Rab11-FIP2, and Rab11-FIP3 (1Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E.K.

Rab11-FIP2 interacts with both Rab11 and myosin Vb and co-localizes with Rab11 in both nonpolarized HeLa cells, and polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (1Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E.K. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol.

We demonstrate that Rab11-FIP2 functions in transferrin recycling. Furthermore, we investigate the consequences of expression of the Rab11-FIP2 COOH-terminal region on the morphology of the early endosomal compartment. We demonstrate that it induces tubulation of the Tfn compartment and that this phenotype cannot be reversed by excess Rab11. This suggests that Rab11-FIP2 functions downstream of Rab11 in endosomal trafficking. The Rab4, Rab6, Rab7, and Rab11 two-hybrid constructs have been described previously (14Wilcke M. Johannes L.

Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The Rab11-FIP2 (KIAA0941) cDNA was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kasuza, Japan. The open reading frame was amplified from the KIAA0941 cDNA by PCR using oligonucleotides with EcoRI sites (forward primer, 5′-CGGAATTCCCTGTCCGAGCAAGCCCAAAAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGGAATTCGAAACCAGCCACAGGATCAATTC-3′) and ligated into theEcoRI site of pGADGH. The insert from pGADGH Rab11-FIP2 was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) and pcDNA3.1HisB (InVitrogen). ThePstI fragment from pEGFP-C1 Rab11-FIP2 was ligated into thePstI site of pEGFP-C1, while the backbone was religated, to produce pEGFP-C1 Rab11-FIP2(446–511) and pEGFP-C1 Rab11-FIP2(1–446), respectively. Rab11-FIP2(446–511) and Rab11-FIP2(1–446) were excised from pEGFP-C1 withEcoRI and SalI and subcloned into pGADGH, pGBT9, and pcDNA3.1HisB. The two-hybrid interactions were performed as described previously (21Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Senic-Matuglia F. Cantalupo G. Goud B. Bucci C. McCaffrey M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12190-12199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast reporter strain L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3::lexA-His3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) was co-transformed with the indicated constructs. Three days post-transformation indivdual colonies were picked, and an interaction was indicated by the ability of the transformants to grow on minimal (Drop out) medium lacking histidine. Antibodies used included the mouse monoclonal antibodies, anti-TfnR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-EEA1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-Xpress (InVitrogen), and sheep polyclonal anti-TGN46 (Serotec). The affinity-purified polyclonal Rab11 antibody has been described elsewhere (14Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were maintained in culture as described previously (23Bielli A. Thörnqvist P.O. Hendrick A.G. Finn R. Fitzgerald K. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The GFP fusion constructs were transfected using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sixteen hours post-transfection the cells were processed for immunofluorescence. For overexpression studies HeLa cells were infected with the attenuated MVA T7 RNA polymerase recombinant vaccinia virus (a kind gift from G. Sutter) and then transfected with the pcDNA3.1HisB Rab11-FIP2(446–511) construct utilizing DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), for 6 h. The uptake/chase experiments were performed as described previously (26Lin S.X. Grant B. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 h post-transfection (with either pcDNA3.1Hisb Rab11-FIP2(446–511) or pcDNA3.1HisB (mock sample)) serum-starved cells were allowed to internalize fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled iron-saturated holotransferrin (33 μg/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C. The uptake sample was then briefly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. For the chase samples, internalized Tfn was allowed to recycle, by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled holotransferrin and desferroxamine (Sigma). Following the chase, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and paraformaldehyde-fixed. To quantify the fluorescence, images of tranfected cells from multiple fields were imported into NIH Image v1.62 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A 4-cm2 box was overlaid onto each cell, and the average fluorescence intensity within the box was quantified, after subtracting the background. Data was compiled from pcDNA3.1HisB (mock) transfected cells and compared with cells expressing pcDNA3.1HisB Rab11-FIP2(446–511). The mean (n = 50) fluorescence intensity remaining in cells after the chase was expressed as a percentage of the mean fluorescence intensity of cells fixed immediately after the FITC-Tfn internalization. The data are representative of three independent experiments. For the depolymerization experiments, transfected HeLa cells were treated with the drugs for 30 min at 37 °C, prior to fixation and immunostaining. Nocodazole (Sigma) and cytochalasin D (Sigma) were solubilized in Me2SO and used at final concentrations of 20 and 10 μm, respectively. Me2SO alone was used on control cells. Cells on 11-mm round glass coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.05% saponin and incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in 5% fetal bovine serum/phosphate-buffered saline. The secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to Texas Red, donkey anti-mouse conjugated to Texas Red, or donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to AMCA (Jackson Immunochemicals). The coverslips were mounted onto slides with Mowiol (Sigma). Immunofluorescence images were recorded on a Nikon E-600 epifluorescence microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu chilled CCD C5985 camera. All images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software. Rab11-FIP2 has recently been described as a Rab11- and myosin Vb interacting protein (1Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C.

Due to the dual binding ability of RCP, and a number of other Rab effectors (27Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M. Stenmark H. Zerial M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether Rab11-FIP2 has the ability to interact with other Rab GTPases. Using the yeast two-hybrid system we tested whether Rab11-FIP2 interacts with Rabs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 11. Consistent with the recent initial description of Rab11-FIP2 (1Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E.K. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, Rab11-FIP2 shows no interaction with Rab4 (Fig.1B), Rab6, or Rab7 (data not shown). The lack of an interaction with Rab4 was surprising, since there is a high degree of homology between the RBD of Rab11-FIP2 and RCP (Fig. 1A). Rab11-FIP2 showed no preference for the nucleotide-bound state of Rab11 (Fig. 1B). This mirrors the interaction profile observed between RCP and Rab11 (21Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Senic-Matuglia F. Cantalupo G. Goud B. Bucci C. McCaffrey M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12190-12199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). RCP interacts with both constitutively active and constitutively inactive mutants of Rab11. In contrast, RCP only interacts with active forms of Rab4, in a typical effector protein pattern. To investigate the subcellular localization of Rab11-FIP2, a vector expressing the full-length protein with an amino-terminal GFP fusion was constructed. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the GFP-Rab11-FIP2 vector. The fusion protein localized to distinct vesicular structures that were present throughout the cytoplasm, but concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell. Immunostaining with an antibody against Rab11 revealed extensive co-localization between Rab11-FIP2 and Rab11 (Fig.2A). Rab11 is localized primarily to the recycling compartment, but has also been observed on the TGN (13Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 29Urbe S. Huber L.A. Zerial M. Tooze S.A. Parton R.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and a minor proportion of Rab11 overlaps with Rab5, an early sorting endosome Rab GTPase (30Trischler M. Stoorvogel W. Ullrich O. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4773-4783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sonnichsen B., De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Rab11-FIP2 also localizes to these compartments, HeLa cells transiently transfected with GFP-Rab11-FIP2 were immunostained with antibodies to EEA1 and TGN46. EEA1 is a Rab5 effector that localizes to the early sorting endosome, and TGN46 is a glycoprotein that labels the TGN. Virtually no co-localization was observed between Rab11-FIP2 and either EEA1 (Fig. 2B) or TGN46 (Fig. 2C). This suggests that Rab11-FIP2 is an endocytic recycling compartment protein and therefore is likely to play a role in regulating the receptor recycling pathway. Rab11-FIP2 possesses a C2 domain near its amino terminus, and a RBD at its COOH terminus (Fig. 1C). Since both the C2 and RBD motifs are both potentially involved in mediating the membrane association of Rab11-FIP2, we decided to investigate the individual membrane binding ability of these domains. Accordingly, we prepared a series of Rab11-FIP2 truncation mutants fused to GFP and examined their localization in HeLa cells. As previously indicated, full-length Rab11-FIP2 labels vesicles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, a truncation mutant lacking the COOH-terminal 65 amino acids, but possessing the phospholipid binding C2 domain (GFP-Rab11-FIP2(1–445)), shows no membrane binding and yields a diffuse cytosolic pattern (Fig. 3A). C2 domains are phospholipid binding motifs that are present in a large number of proteins involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking (32Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the large GFP tag (∼26 kDa) may be interfering with the C2 domain, and thus preventing phospholipid binding, the truncation mutant was fused to a smaller Xpress epitope (∼3 kDa) and expressed in HeLa cells. This construct also displayed no membrane association (data not shown). In contrast, a construct expressing the COOH-terminal 65 amino acids of Rab11-FIP2 (GFP-Rab11-FIP2(446–511)), which contains the RBD, displayed extensive membrane association (Fig. 3A). The observation that the predicted coiled-coil domain of Rab11-FIP2 is sufficient for its membrane association suggests that another protein acts as a receptor for Rab11-FIP2 on its target membrane. The C2 domain may increase the specificity of Rab11-FIP2 membrane binding and/or regulate its association/dissociation. An interesting phenotype was observed in a proportion of the HeLa cells expressing the GFP-Rab11-FIP2(446–511) truncation mutant. In these cells we observed an elaborate tubular, Rab11-positive, membrane network (Fig. 3B). We recently demonstrated that overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of RCP, that contains its RBD, results in a similar tubular endosomal network. We proposed that this phenotype was a result of the RCP truncation mutant sequestering the endogenous Rab11, and/or Rab4, in an inactive complex (21Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Senic-Matuglia F. Cantalupo G. Goud B. Bucci C. McCaffrey M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12190-12199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Overexpression of dominant-negative Rab11, Rab11S25N, also results in similar tubulation (14Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To investigate the Rab11-FIP2 mutant phenotype further, a recombinant vaccinia virus system was used in which HeLa cells were infected with virus encoding the T7 RNA polymerase, which allows for the expression of high levels of Rab11-FIP2(446–511) that is under the control of the T7 promoter. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated transferrin (FITC-Tfn), or a monoclonal TfnR antibody, was used to label the receptor recycling pathway. A Rab11-FIP2(446–511) construct, or an empty vector control, was transfected into cells that had been infected with the modified vaccinia virus. Six hours post-transfection FITC-Tfn was internalized in these cells, at 37 °C for 45 min. Approximately 70% of cells overexpressing Rab11-FIP2(446–511) displayed an intricate FITC-Tfn-positive tubular network (Fig.4B). The FITC-Tfn in control cells displayed a punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm, with a concentration of vesicles in the perinuclear region (Fig.4A). Treatment of Rab11-FIP2(446–511)-expressing cells with the microtubule depolymerizing agent, nocodazole, resulted in the breakdown of these tubules (Fig. 4C). In contrast, depolymerization of actin filaments with cytochalasin D did not disrupt the tubules. This suggests that the Rab11-FIP2(446–511)-induced tubules are organized along the microtubule cytoskeleton. Overexpression of dominant-negative RCP results in an inhibition in the recycling of transferrin (21Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Senic-Matuglia F. Cantalupo G. Goud B. Bucci C. McCaffrey M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12190-12199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To determine whether the FITC-Tfn labeling the Rab11-FIP2(446–511)-induced tubules is prevented from recycling to the plasma membrane, cells expressing Rab11-FIP2(446–511) were allowed to internalize the ligand at 37 °C for 45 min. After this loading step, the cells were extensively washed and chased for 30 min, at 37 °C, in the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabelled Tfn. In cells fixed directly after the loading step, FITC-Tfn was present to a similar extent in both Rab11-FIP2(446–511)-expressing, and -nonexpressing, cells (Fig. 5A). However, more FITC-Tfn was retained in Rab11-FIP2(446–511)-expressing cells after the chase, when compared with nonexpressing cells in the same field (Fig. 5B). Quantification of the level of FITC fluorescence remaining in cells after the 30-min chase revealed that there was at least 2-fold more FITC-Tfn retained in cells expressing Rab11-FIP2(446–511) as compared with that retained in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 5C). This suggests that Rab11-FIP2(446–511) is acting as a dominant-negative mutant of the full-length protein and inhibits the rate of recycling along the receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway. The dominant-negative RCP phenotype could be reversed by adding active Rab11 to the system. This suggested that RCP functions upstream of Rab11 in the receptor recycling pathway (21Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Senic-Matuglia F. Cantalupo G. Goud B. Bucci C. McCaffrey M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12190-12199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rab11-FIP2 functions upstream or downstream of Rab11, we investigated whether the tubular phenotype induced upon Rab11-FIP2(446–511) expression could be rescued by the addition of active Rab11. FITC-Tfn uptake was repeated in cells co-expressing Rab11-FIP2(446–511) and wild-type Rab11 or Rab11Q70L. However, no rescue of the Rab11-FIP2(446–511)phenotype was observed (Fig. 6,A and B). This result suggests that Rab11-FIP2 functions downstream of Rab11 in the receptor recycling pathway. A number of Rab effector proteins, including EEA1 (33Callaghan J. Simonsen A. Gaullier J.M. Toh B.H. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Rabaptin-5 (27Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M. Stenmark H. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), have the ability to dimerize. We investigated whether Rab11-FIP2 also has this ability. Our results indicate that Rab11-FIP2 and other members of the Rab11-FIP family (pp75/Rip11, RCP, Rab11-FIP2, and Rab11-FIP3) can self-interact (22Wallace D.M. Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine the domains of Rab11-FIP2 that mediate this homo-interaction, the Rab11-FIP2 deletion mutants were tested for their ability to interact with each other in the yeast two-hybrid system. The COOH-terminal domain has the ability to interact with itself, as does the amino-terminal domain (Fig.7). The carboxy-terminal domain can also interact with the amino-terminal domain. This suggests that Rab11-FIP2 has the potential to form oligomers in a parallel, or anti-parallel, manner. Interestingly, a recently described Rab5-binding protein, RIN2, has been proposed to form a tetramer composed of two anti-parallel dimers (34Saito K. Murai J. Kajiho H. Kontani K. Kurosu H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 3412-3418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). During the past year, three groups have independently reported the existence of a novel family of Rab11 interacting proteins (1Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C. Hardy D. Kumar R.

Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There are at least six members that belong to this family. These include Rip11 (19Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), RCP (21Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Senic-Matuglia F. Cantalupo G. Goud B. Bucci C. McCaffrey M.W. J. Biol.

Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rab11-FIP2 and Rab11-FIP3 have also been reported by Prekeris et al. (20Prekeris R. Davies J.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) under the names of nRip11 and Eferin, respectively. RCP is unique among these proteins in that it also interacts with Rab4-GTP. It was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for Rab4 effectors (21Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Senic-Matuglia F. Cantalupo G. Goud B. Bucci C. McCaffrey M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12190-12199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These proteins have a low overall homology, but they all share a conserved COOH-terminal predicted α-helical coiled-coil domain. This domain mediates their interaction with Rab11, and in the case of RCP, with Rab4. RCP, Rip11, and Rab11-FIP2 share a conserved C2 phospholipid binding domain near their amino termini. C2 domains are phospholipid binding motifs that have been found on a number of proteins involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking. Phospholipid binding may be Ca2+-dependent, or Ca2+-independent (32Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), and in some cases, such as for Rip11, may be Mg2+-dependent (19Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Rab11-FIP3 and Rab11-FIP4 possess EF-hand motifs. EF-hands are the most common calcium sensor motifs found in mammalian proteins (35Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The members of the Rab11-FIP family have been characterized to varying degrees. Rip11 is a membrane-bound protein proposed to play a role in trafficking from the apical recycling compartment to plasma membrane and has been demonstrated to bind membranes in a manner regulated by its phosphorylation state (19Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). RCP is a predominantly membrane-bound, recycling compartment protein that functions in transferrin recycling and is likely to be involved in transport from the early sorting endosome to the recycling compartment. Overexpression of a truncation mutant of RCP results in an inhibition in the recycling of Tfn (21Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Senic-Matuglia F. Cantalupo G. Goud B. Bucci C. McCaffrey M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12190-12199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Rab11-FIP2 and Rab11-FIP3 have both been localized to a Rab11-positive compartment in polarized MDCK cells and nonpolarized HeLa cells (1Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C. Hardy D.

Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Rab11-FIP4 was recently identified using a bioinformatics approach (22Wallace D.M. Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). While characterizing RCP, we identified Rab11-FIP2 and Rip11, both of which have since been independently reported (1Hales C.M. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K.C. Dorn M.C. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E.K. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39067-39075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 19Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Since RCP interacts in a nucleotide-dependent manner with Rab4, we were interested to determine whether Rab11-FIP2 also interacts with Rab4 or with other Rab GTPases. We show here that Rab11-FIP2 does not interact with Rab4. Furthermore, it does not interact with any of the other Rabs tested (Rabs 3, 5, 6, and 7; data not shown). The full-length protein, fused to GFP, localizes to discrete Rab11-positive vesicles concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell. These structures are not positive for EEA1 or TGN46, suggesting that they are part of the endocytic recycling compartment. Since the coiled-coil domain and the C2 domain are highly conserved in this family, we set about determining their roles in the subcellular localization of Rab11-FIP2. Rab11-FIP2 truncation mutants were constructed that expressed the C2 domain but not the RBD, or the RBD domain alone, fused to GFP. Our results demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal 65 residues that encompass the coiled-coil domain and includes the RBD are necessary and sufficient for Rab11-FIP2 membrane binding. This suggests that Rab11-FIP2 membrane association may be mediated by a receptor located at its target membrane. This could be membrane-bound Rab11 or another membrane protein. The C2 domain alone did not have the ability to localize to membranes. It is possible that the C2 domain may regulate the membrane association/dissociation of Rab11-FIP2 or sense the appropriate phospholipid environment. We observed that expression of the Rab11-FIP2 predicted coiled-coil domain resulted in the formation of an extensive tubular network that was strongly labeled with Rab11. These tubules were dispersed upon treatment with nocodazole, but were relatively unaffected by cytochalasin D, suggesting they are maintained/supported by microtubules. Loading of these tubules with FITC-Tfn and analyzing the recycling of the ligand out, indicated that the Tfn was being retained. This suggests that the Rab11-FIP2(446–511) mutant inhibits trafficking through the receptor recycling pathway. A similar phenotype was observed when a dominant-negative mutant of RCP was overexpressed in HeLa cells. This phenotype could be reversed by co-expression of active Rab11; we therefore proposed that RCP functions upstream of Rab11 in the receptor recycling pathway (21Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Senic-Matuglia F. Cantalupo G. Goud B. Bucci C. McCaffrey M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12190-12199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To determine whether active Rab11 could also rescue the dominant-negative phenotype that results from the expression of the Rab11-FIP2 COOH-terminal domain, wild-type, and dominant-positive Rab11 (Rab11Q70L) were co-overexpressed with the C-terminal region of Rab11-FIP2. However, in this case we did not observe rescue of the tubular phenotype. Using the yeast two-hybrid system we demonstrate that the COOH- and amino-terminal domains of Rab11-FIP2 have the ability to self-bind and to bind each other. This gives the protein the potential to form oligomers composed of parallel and/or anti-parallel dimers. RIN2, a Rab5-binding protein, has recently been shown to form a tetramer composed of anitparallel dimers (34Saito K. Murai J. Kajiho H. Kontani K. Kurosu H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 3412-3418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Rabaptin-5 and EEA1 form dimers (27Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M.

Only a single substrate, the Fe/S template protein IscU, has been identified for the Hsc66/Hsc20 system, but the mechanism by which Hsc66 selectively binds IscU is unknown. We have investigated Hsc66 substrate specificity using phage display and a peptide array of IscU. Screening of a heptameric peptide phage display library revealed that Hsc66 prefers peptides with a centrally located Pro-Pro motif. Using a cellulose-bound peptide array of IscU we determined that Hsc66 interacts specifically with a region (residues 99–103, LPPVK) that is invariant among all IscU family members. A synthetic peptide (ELPPVKIHC) corresponding to IscU residues 98–106 behaves in a similar manner to native IscU, stimulating the ATPase activity of Hsc66 with similar affinity as IscU, preventing Hsc66 suppression of bovine rhodanese aggregation, and interacting with the peptide-binding domain of Hsc66. Unlike native IscU, however, the synthetic peptide is not bound by Hsc20 and does not synergistically stimulate Hsc66 ATPase activity with Hsc20. Our results indicate that Hsc66 and Hsc20 recognize distinct regions of IscU and further suggest that Hsc66 will not bind LPPVK motifs with high affinity in vivo unless they are in the context of native IscU and can be directed to Hsc66 by Hsc20.

Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). IscU is a highly conserved 14-kDa protein that can form reduction-labile 2Fe-2S and 4Fe-4S clusters (6Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The ability of IscU to form clusters in vitro suggests that it may function as a scaffold for the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters (6Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,9Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and Hsc66 and Hsc20 may comprise a specialized chaperone system that participates in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins. Mutational analysis of the genes encoding Hsc66, Hsc20, and IscU support this idea (10Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, homologs of these proteins with similar functions have also been identified in higher organisms suggesting that this specialized system has been conserved throughout evolution (11Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A., Ta, D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 12Garland S.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17524-17532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The structural determinants required for Hsc66 binding to substrates remain unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the physiological function of Hsc66 involves recognition of a specific peptide motif or whether Hsc66 interacts with a wide array of peptide substrates. DnaK, the other major Hsp70 present in E. coli, exhibits broad substrate specificity (16Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Phage display, peptide array, and structural studies reveal that DnaK prefers unfolded peptides approximately eight amino acids in length and enriched by hydrophobic residues flanked at either end by basic residues (16Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 18Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). This general type of motif is found in most proteins and occurs on average every 36 amino acids; because of this DnaK interacts with a large percentage of cellular proteins, and many proteins have multiple DnaK-binding sites (17Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Hsc66 shares 42% sequence identity with DnaK but differs at residues found to be important for DnaK binding to substrates (3Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). This may impart Hsc66 with different substrate specificity than DnaK, and several lines of evidence support this possibility. In vivo studies have shown that Hsc66 is incapable of substituting for DnaK, because a dnaK− strain of E. coli is inviable at high temperatures (19Paek K.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 283-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Hsc66 is not able to prevent bulk protein aggregation in these cells (20Hesterkamp T. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4818-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).In vitro, Hsc66 is capable of preventing the aggregation of denatured model substrates, but it does this with differing specificity than DnaK (3Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, Hsc66 has been found to interact with native IscU, whereas IscU stimulates DnaK ATPase only weakly (6Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To gain understanding of the structural determinants of substrates important for Hsc66 binding we have used two different approaches. First, we examined Hsc66 binding to an unconstrained library of peptide heptamers displayed in a phage library. Second, to determine whether there is a correlation between peptides selected in the phage library and Hsc66 recognition of IscU, as well as to determine whether Hsc66 binds IscU in a specific location or at various sites, we screened a cellulose array displaying the entire sequence of IscU as overlapping peptides 13 amino acids in length. Peptides identified by both approaches have been synthesized and their effects on Hsc66 ATPase activity have been examined. We have found that Hsc66 prefers peptides with centrally located proline residues and, consistent with this finding, Hsc66 binds specifically to one region of IscU that displays the sequence LPPVK. E. coli DH5αFIQ cells were from Invitrogen and BL–21(DE3)pLysS cells were from Novagen. Materials for Fmoc1 peptide synthesis were from NovaBiochem. Bacterial growth media components were from Difco, and other reagents were from Sigma. Recombinant Hsc66, Hsc66:2-382, Hsc66:2-505, Hsc20, DnaK, and IscU were expressed and purified as previously described (2Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Silberg J.J.

U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Phage display experiments were conducted using the PH.D-7 phage library (New England Biolabs) as directed by the manufacturer with slight modifications as follows. Briefly, M13 phage with a random seven-residue peptide encoded at the N terminus of the pIII protein were incubated with immobilized Hsc66 in HKM buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 1 mm ADP. Unbound phage were washed (three times, 20 min each), and bound phage were released using HKM buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP. Bound phage were amplified, and after three rounds of enrichment 133 phage were selected, their DNA sequenced, and the heptameric peptide sequence was deduced from translation of the nucleotide sequence. Data for the 70 phage from the naı̈ve library were provided by the manufacturer. The cellulose-bound peptide scan of the entire IscU sequence consisted of 53 13–residue peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids and anchored via a C-terminal Ala2 linkage (Jerini Bio Tools GmbH, Berlin, Germany). For analysis of chaperone binding, either Hsc66 or DnaK (5 μm) were incubated with the membrane in HKM buffer supplemented with 1 mm ADP at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed two times (10 min each) at room temperature with HKM containing 1 mm ADP. Bound protein was transferred to polyvinylene difluoride membranes via electroblotting with a semi-dry blotter using a constant current of 0.8 mA/cm2. Protein transferred to polyvinylene difluoride was visualized by affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antisera to Hsc66 (or anti-DnaK mouse monoclonal antibody; Stressgen) using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). For studies of Hsc20 effects, 50 μm Hsc20 was added to Hsc66 in HKM buffer with 1 mm ADP prior to incubation of the blot. Hsc20 binding to the array was carried out in HKM buffer using 50 μm Hsc20 in the absence of Hsc66. IscU peptide E98-C106 and phage display peptide PD1 were prepared by the Stanford core facility (Palo Alto, CA) or synthesized using standard Fmoc chemistry (21Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989Google Scholar). Peptides were subsequently purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and their composition was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peptide concentrations were determined by Ellman's reagent (22Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) upon reaction with the C-terminal cysteine of IscU E98-C106 or UV absorbance based on an extinction coefficient of 5,600 (m cm)−1 at 280 nm for PD1 based on a single tryptophan residue (23Pace C.N.

Steady-state ATPase rates were determined at 23 °C in HKM buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1.5 mm ATP by measuring phosphate released using the EnzCheck-coupled enzyme phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes) as previously reported (2Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J.

A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Under these conditions Hsc66 has a basal turnover number of 0.12 min−1. Error bars for all figures are shown when they fall outside the symbol used. The aggregation of bovine rhodanese was performed in HKM buffer containing 1 mm ADP as described previously (3Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hsc66 was incubated with peptide or IscU for 10 min at 25 °C prior to addition of denatured rhodanese and changes in turbidity were monitored in a Cary 1 spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) at 320 nm. Phage display libraries have been used to establish peptide binding specificities for the E. coli Hsp70 DnaK (16Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), bovine Hsc70 (26Takenaka I.M. Leung S.M. McAndrew S.J. Brown J.P. Hightower L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19839-19844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP (27Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), and each of these hsp70s were found to prefer peptides with a high content of centrally located hydrophobic residues. To determine whether Hsc66 binds preferentially to peptides of similar sequences we screened a M13 coliphage peptide display library for Hsc66 binding. The coliphage in these experiments carry a random 7-amino acid extension linked by a –Gly3–Ser– sequence at the N terminus of the pIII surface protein. Affinity panning experiments for Hsc66 binding were conducted using polystyrene plates that had been coated with Hsc66 and then blocked with bovine serum albumin. Phage were incubated with plates in the presence of 1 mm ADP to ensure that Hsc66 was in the high affinity R-state for substrate binding (4Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After washing, ADP-containing buffer was exchanged for buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP, thereby converting Hsc66 to the low substrate affinity T-state and eluting specifically bound phage. After three rounds of enrichment, 133 phage were sequenced, and the amino acid sequences of the heptamers were determined. As shown in Fig.1 25 unique heptameric sequences were identified. Two heptamers, SLWPPVS and MSPILSP, accounted for greater than 50% of the total identified phage. This differs from similar studies where a broad array of unique peptides was isolated for DnaK (16Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and BiP (27Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The relative occurrence of the 20 amino acids in the selected phage was calculated by quantifying the number of times each amino acid occurred in the 133 heptamers and dividing by the total number of amino acids. These values were compared with the relative occurrence of each amino acid from 70 phage in the naı̈ve library (Fig.2A). Seven amino acids show increased occurrence among the bound phage. As seen for other chaperones (16Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Rudiger S. Germeroth L.

Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), hydrophobic residues (Ile, Val, and Leu) are over-represented. In addition, tryptophan, an amino acid favored by BiP, is enriched among Hsc66-bound phage, although this results largely from its presence in the most abundant peptide sequence, SLWPPVS. Of the 3 remaining amino acids that show enrichment in Hsc66-bound phage (Ser, Met, and Pro), methionine shows neutral contributions to the binding of substrates to BiP and DnaK. Serine is also a neutral contributor to DnaK, but is slightly selected against in BiP substrates. Proline shows neutral contributions to substrate binding to BiP, but is selected against in DnaK substrates (16Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 27Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Cysteine is under-represented in the naı̈ve library and was not analyzed. In addition to an enrichment of proline, 42% of the selected phage (56 of 133) contained two adjacent proline residues. This is a 10-fold increase over the naı̈ve library in which only 4.3% (3 of 70) of the sequenced phage contained this motif. The strong preference for adjacent prolines arises in part because of the heptapeptide SLWPPVS found in 44 of 133 of the selected phage. However, the Pro-Pro motif is also present in 20% (5 of 25) of the unique phage peptide sequences selected by Hsc66; this remains a 5-fold increase over the naı̈ve library. Adjacent proline residues were not identified as substrates for either DnaK or BiP in previous phage display studies (16Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 27Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). All other amino acids are disfavored for Hsc66 binding. As found for DnaK substrate specificity, acidic amino acids are under-represented in Hsc66-bound phage. However, aromatic residues tyrosine and phenylalanine and basic residues arginine and lysine that act as positive contributors to DnaK substrate binding are disfavored by Hsc66. Thus, not only does Hsc66 prefer residues disfavored by DnaK (proline), but it also disfavors positive contributors to DnaK substrate binding. Analysis of the different classes of amino acids as a function of their position in the heptapeptide is shown in Fig. 2B. The profile displays a higher proportion of polar residues at the termini, whereas the central positions are dominated by hydrophobic amino acids. Positions one and two show no preference for either hydrophobic or polar amino acids with each class occupying these positions in about half of the phage. Hydrophobic residues predominate positions 3–6, with Pro accounting for greater than 50% of the hydrophobic amino acids at positions 4 and 5. Polar residues appear to be preferred at position 7. Based on this analysis, the consensus sequence for Hsc66-bound phage exhibits the patternX-X-Hφ-Pro-Pro-Hφ-polar, where Hφ is a hydrophobic residue (commonly Leu or Val) and X represents an equal likelihood of polar or hydrophobic residues. Because of the possibility that the high proportion of selected phage carrying either the SLWPPVS or MSPILSP heptapeptides may bias the consensus sequence, the data was also analyzed excluding either one of the peptides. The overall conclusions remained the same, and in both cases, the consensus sequence retained the Hφ–Pro–Pro–Hφ–polar motif. To date, the Fe/S-escort protein IscU is the only natural substrate that has been identified for Hsc66 (5Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine locations of Hsc66 binding in the IscU primary sequence, we utilized a cellulose-bound peptide array corresponding to the IscU sequence. The array contained peptides of 13 residues, a length shown to allow DnaK binding to similar blots of ς32 (29McCarty J.S. Rudiger S. Schonfeld H.J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and other proteins (17Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Starting with the N terminus of IscU, successive peptides were shifted by 2 amino acids along the IscU sequence resulting in an overlap of 11 residues. Hsc66 was incubated with the array in HKM buffer containing 1 mmADP to stabilize Hsc66 in the high affinity R-state for substrate binding (3Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Incubation was carried out for 1 h, a time period ∼10-fold longer than found necessary for Hsc66·ADP to reach equilibrium with native IscU in surface plasmon resonance experiments (5Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The array was then washed to remove unbound Hsc66, and bound Hsc66 was electrotransferred to polyvinylene difluoride membranes and detected by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig.3A, screening by this method revealed a single Hsc66-binding region that spans residues 91–111 of IscU. The five peptides identified share an overlapping 5-amino acid sequence, LPPVK (residues 99–103). The LPPVK sequence is in good agreement with the last 5 amino acids of the consensus sequence that was identified by phage display, Hφ-Pro-Pro-Hφ-polar (Fig.2B). To determine whether Hsc66 binding is specific for this region of IscU or is a function of general chaperone binding to the IscU blot, we conducted a similar experiment using DnaK. DnaK bound to five separate regions of the arrayed IscU sequence corresponding to 25 individual peptides (Fig. 3B). This number of binding sites is consistent with DnaK binding to other cellulose-peptide arrays in which DnaK-binding sites were found to occur approximately every 36 residues on average (17Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Like Hsc66, DnaK also binds to peptides containing the LPPVK motif consistent with its general preference for peptides with hydrophobic central residues and a basic C terminus. Unlike Hsc66, however, DnaK bound to several other regions of the IscU blot with equal or greater affinity. These results indicate that Hsc66 binding is more specific than that of DnaK, and suggest that Hsc66 does not simply function as a general chaperone with broad substrate specificity. The specificity of Hsc66 for peptides containing the LPPVK sequence suggests that this segment may be a major determinant for interactions with Hsc66. To investigate whether this region is sufficient to mediate IscU-like interactions with Hsc66, a peptide corresponding to residues 98–106, ELPPVKIHC (E98-C106) of the IscU protein was synthesized. As an initial investigation of the ability of the peptide to interact with Hsc66, we examined its effect on the stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity. As shown in Fig. 4, E98-C106 is capable of stimulating the steady-state ATPase activity of Hsc66. Moreover, E98-C106 stimulation of Hsc66 occurs with similar affinity (Km ≅ 27 μm) as chaperone stimulation by full-length IscU (Km ≅ 34 μm). This binding affinity is within the range of affinities measured for peptide substrates interacting with the ATP state of DnaK (30Pierpaoli E.V. Gisler S.M. Christen P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16741-17648Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Jordan R. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4563-4569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Gisler S.M. Pierpaoli E.V. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The correlation between the affinity of Hsc66 for IscU and for the E98-C106 peptide suggests that this is a key region of IscU necessary for binding and the main contributor to the affinity of Hsc66 for IscU. The maximal stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase caused by peptide (4-fold), however, is approximately half that elicited by IscU (7–8-fold). This may reflect the fact that other regions of IscU that do not significantly increase the affinity of Hsc66 for IscU are necessary for maximal stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity. When the peptide SLWPPVSGG (designated PD1) corresponding to the most highly represented phage from affinity panning experiments was examined, it also was found to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc66 (Fig. 4). However, the concentration for half-maximal stimulation occurs at a concentration (Km > 1 mm) at least 40-fold higher than that required for the IscU peptide. Because of the low affinity for PD1, it was not possible to determine the maximal stimulation elicited. Hsc20 binds to IscU, and the two proteins synergistically stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc66 (6Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We demonstrate that EGF stimulation of T47D cells results in the activation of the Src protein-tyrosine kinase and that the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 blocks the EGF-induced phosphorylation of c-Cbl but not the activation/phosphorylation of the EGF receptor itself. PP1 also blocks EGF-induced ubiquitination of the EGF receptor, which is presumably mediated by phosphorylated c-Cbl. Src is associated with c-Cbl, and we have previously demonstrated that the Src-like kinase Fyn can phosphorylate c-Cbl at a preferred binding site for the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. PP1 treatment blocks EGF-induced activation of the anti-apoptotic protein kinase Akt suggesting that Src may regulate activation of Akt, perhaps by a Src → c-Cbl → phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase → Akt pathway.

Kahn C.R J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) receptor requires activation of the tyrosine kinase of the receptor to activate downstream signaling molecules. Downstream signaling pathways activated by the EGF receptor include the classic Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, phospholipase C, and PI3-kinase. Although some signaling molecules are activated by direct binding to the activated EGF receptor, mediated by the direct binding of their SH2 domains to phosphorylated tyrosine residues, other signaling molecules do not appear to bind directly to the receptor itself, yet they are activated in a receptor-dependent manner. With regard to the EGF receptor, examples of the former include phospholipase C, whereas an example of the latter type of interaction is PI3-kinase, which does not appear to bind to the EGF receptor. In recent years it has become clear that large scaffolding molecules such as insulin-regulated substrate-1, Gab1, Gab2, and perhaps c-Cbl, may function in cooperation with growth factor receptors to regulate activation of downstream signaling molecules that do not bind directly to growth factor receptors (1White M.F.

Complicating the view of c-Cbl as merely a molecular scaffold is the observation that the C. elegans homologue of c-Cbl,sli-1, functions as a negative regulator of theC. elegans EGF receptor homologue let-63 (5Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, overexpression of c-Cbl in fibroblasts results in the down-regulation of the EGF receptor (30Lill N.L. Douillard P. Awwad R.A. Ota S. Lupher M.L. Miyake S.

A mechanism explaining this observation was revealed when it was realized that the RING finger motif of c-Cbl could function as part of a ubiquitin ligase complex (32Joazeiro C.A.P. Wing S.S.

This leads to the question of whether the primary cellular function of c-Cbl is as a scaffolding molecule, a ubiquitin ligase, or both. In this paper we demonstrate that EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Cbl appears to require a PP1-sensitive tyrosine kinase, presumably one of the members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Blocking phosphorylation of c-Cbl with PP1 also blocks ubiquitination of the EGF receptor following EGF stimulation, although the EGFR is activated and autophosphorylated. Furthermore, the activation of Src family members regulates activation of the anti-apoptotic protein kinase Akt, perhaps by a Src → c-Cbl → PI3-kinase → Akt pathway. The human breast cancer cell line T47D was obtained from Dr. Dean Edwards (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). MCF12A cells were obtained from the University of Colorado Cancer Center Tissue Culture Core Facility. T47D cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids, 0.4 μg/ml insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MCF12A were cultured in a 50:50 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.1 μg/ml cholera toxin, 20 ng/ml EGF, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Fetal calf serum was from Summit Biotechnology (Fort Collins, CO); horse serum was from Sigma, and charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). Murine epidermal growth factor was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). All other media components were from Invitrogen. Cells to be stimulated with EGF were cultured overnight (for 16 h) in culture media lacking fetal calf serum prior to stimulation with growth factors at the indicated concentrations and for the times indicated prior to harvest. PP1 was obtained from Calbiochem or Alexis Biochemical Co. (San Diego, CA). Cells to be immunoprecipitated were lysed in EB (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate with 100 units/ml aprotinin), and the lysates were clarified by spinning at 10,000 rpm in a Savant RCF13K refrigerated microcentrifuge for 30 min. For the experiments involving ubiquitin, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 50 μm N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal were added to the extraction buffer. 1–2 μg of the indicated antibodies were added to 1 ml of cell lysate corresponding to 1 mg of total cellular protein, as determined by the Pierce BCA protein assay (Pierce), and placed on a rocking platform for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by adding 30 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem) to each immunoprecipitate for 1 h. The bound proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were electrotransfered to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Detection of proteins by immunoblotting was conducted using the enhanced chemiluminescence lighting (ECL) system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (AmershamBiosciences). In some experiments whole cell lysates were directly analyzed by immunoblotting without immunoprecipitation. Agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (catalogue number 16–101) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase (catalogue number 06–195) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

Anti-Shc (catalogue number S14630), anti-EGF receptor antibody (catalogue number E12020), and a second anti-p85 antibody (catalogue number 65721A) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A polyclonal antibody directed against c-Cbl was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalogue number sc-170, Santa Cruz, CA). EGFR antibodies used in the experiments in Fig. 8 were also from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalogue number sc-120 for immune precipitations and sc-03 for Western blotting). Monoclonal antibody 4G10 directed against phosphotyrosine was kindly provided by Dr. Brian Druker (University of Oregon Health Sciences Center, Portland, OR). Anti-Src antibody 2-17 was produced in this laboratory as were two monoclonal antibodies directed against c-Cbl (802H6 for immunoprecipitation and A672E4 for immunoblotting). The anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody Ubi-1 was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (catalogue number 13–1600, South San Francisco, CA). PI kinase assay was conducted as described previously (11Anderson S.M. Burton E.A. Koch B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).

The names for the fusion proteins used in this study and the amino acids included in the proteins are as follows: GST-PRO (proline-rich region, amino acids 475–694); GST-LZIP (the C-terminal end of c-Cbl which includes the leucine zipper region, amino acids 426–906, GST-LZIP-Y731F (GST-LZIP with tyrosine 731 mutated to a phenylalanine). A cDNA clone of human c-CBL was provided by W. Langdon (University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia) and was used as the template to make all of these GST fusion proteins. All primers were taken directly from the published DNA sequence of this cDNA. Mutagenesis of individual codons was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the Ex-Site mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). GST fusion proteins encoding the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains and the SH3 domain of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase were kindly provided by Dr. Lewis Cantley (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The purification of the GST fusion proteins was conducted as described previously (11Anderson S.M. Burton E.A. Koch B.L. J. Biol.

Binding assays were conducted by adding 2 nmol of the desired GST fusion protein to a cell lysate prepared in RIPA buffer as described above, in a final volume of 1 ml. Following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C on a rocking platform, 40 μl of glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated for 1 h. The bound proteins were washed three times with RIPA, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and subjected to immunoblotting as described above.

Stimulation of cells with EGF has been reported to activate numerous signaling molecules, including the large adapter molecule c-Cbl (8Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

To examine the role of c-Cbl in the proliferation of human breast cancer cells, we first examined the effect of EGF stimulation upon c-Cbl phosphorylation in T47D cells. EGF stimulation resulted in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and its association with multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig.1). A major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of approximately 185 kDa was observed to co-precipitate with c-Cbl, along with minor bands of 62 and 54 kDa (Fig. 1). Based upon the work of other investigators (7Levkowitz G. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Freywald A. Sela M. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1117-1125PubMed Google Scholar, 8Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Nature. 1992; 359: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), the major band of 185 kDa appears to be the EGF receptor. The minor bands of 62 and 54 kDa appeared to correspond to tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc as indicated by reprobing the immunoblot with anti-Shc antibody (Fig. 1 B). The position and amount of c-Cbl in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot were confirmed by reprobing the blot with anti-c-Cbl antibody. Although the amount of c-Cbl protein appeared to decrease following EGF stimulation (Fig. 1 C), this appeared to be an artifact of the way this experiment was done. When a similar immunoblot was first probed with anti-Cbl antibody, there was no decrease in the amount of c-Cbl protein (data not shown), although when the blot was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody first followed by the anti-Cbl antibody, it appeared that there was a transient decrease in the amount of c-Cbl protein (Fig. 1 C). This suggested to us that the extensive signal detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody may prevent the binding of a portion of the anti-Cbl antibody. Our previous work (11Anderson S.M. Burton E.A. Koch B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with the interleukin-3 and prolactin receptors indicated that there was an increase in c-Cbl-associated PI3-kinase activity following cytokine stimulation, even though we could not detect the phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase. No readily apparent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with a molecular weight corresponding to that of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase was detected in EGF-stimulated T47D cells (Fig. 1 A); however, we did detect the rapid and transient association of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase with c-Cbl by immunoblotting with anti-p85 antibody (Fig.1 D, lanes 2 and 3). In the study shown in Fig. 1, the amount of p85 associated with c-Cbl peaked quickly (2 min after stimulation with EGF in the study shown) and declined after that time. These data suggest that there is a rapid and transient association of c-Cbl with the EGF receptor, Shc, and the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase. Of these interactions, the complex of c-Cbl with Shc appears to be more stable. A dose-response study was conducted to determine what concentration of EGF was required to induce phosphorylation of c-Cbl. T47D cells were stimulated with 0–200 ng/ml EGF for 10 min, and the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Cbl antibody. The resolved proteins were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Fig.2). Treatment of T47D cells with EGF concentrations as low as 5 ng/ml was able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of both c-Cbl and the EGF receptor (Fig. 2). Stimulation with concentrations greater than 100 ng/ml caused no further increase in the phosphorylation of either c-Cbl or the EGF receptor. Stimulation of T47D cells also caused a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of a protein with a molecular weight corresponding to two different isoforms of Shc (Fig. 2). There was no effect of EGF stimulation upon the amount of c-Cbl protein present in the immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Studies by other investigators (43Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

The transformation of mammary epithelial cells into tumor cells may involve the induction of proliferative signals, anti-apoptotic signals, or perhaps both. For this reason we wished to investigate further the data shown in Fig. 1 regarding the association of PI3-kinase with c-Cbl following stimulation of T47D cells with EGF. We first asked whether PI kinase activity was also associated with c-Cbl following EGF stimulation of T47D cells. T47D cells were stimulated with EGF for 0–20 min, and the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Cbl antibody. One-tenth of the immunoprecipitated protein was used in a PI kinase assay, and the remainder of the protein was subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-p85 monoclonal antibody (Fig.3 A). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1, the rapid phosphorylation of c-Cbl was noted, as was the co-immunoprecipitation of a 185-kDa protein corresponding to the EGF receptor (data not shown). The rapid association of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase with c-Cbl following EGF stimulation was also detected (Fig. 3 A). The maximal amount of c-Cbl-associated p85 was detectable at 1–2 min and declined after that time (Fig.3 A). It did appear that there were two bands in the anti-p85 immunoblot, and we do not know whether this represents modification of p85 or the presence of different p85 isoforms. c-Cbl-associated PI kinase activity was also examined using a PI kinase assay. A maximal amount of PI kinase activity was also detected after 1 min of stimulation with EGF (Fig. 3 B, lane 9). Although c-Cbl-associated PI kinase activity was still detectable 2 min post-stimulation, it declined dramatically after that time (Fig.3 B). Other studies in our laboratory have shown that c-Cbl-associated PI kinase activity can be detected after 5 min of stimulation with EGF; however, kinase activity was not detectable at later time points (10–30 min) (data not shown). PhosphorImager quantitation indicated that there was 2–5-fold more c-Cbl-associated PI kinase activity at 1-min post-EGF stimulation than present 2 min after EGF stimulation. There did not appear to be a dramatic difference in the amount of c-Cbl-associated p85 protein at 1 and 2 min post-EGF stimulation when compared with the difference in PI kinase activity observed at these two time points (compare Fig. 3, A andB); however, the kinase assay should reflect the amount of activated PI3-kinase and not the total amount of p85. These data indicate that both p85 and PI kinase activity are rapidly associated with c-Cbl following stimulation of T47D cells with EGF, and the kinetics of PI kinase activation and p85 binding to c-Cbl suggests that this event may represent a very early signaling event. The binding of c-Cbl to p85 was examined in a series of binding assays utilizing GST fusion proteins that contained different regions of either p85 or c-Cbl. The p85 subunit of PI3-kinase contained two SH2 domains (referred to as the N-SH2 and C-SH2 for the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains, respectively) and a single SH3 domain (48Kapeller R. Prasad K.V.S. Janssen O. Hou W. Schaffhausen B.S. Rudd C.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 1927-1933Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The ability of GST fusion proteins encoding these three domains to bind to c-Cbl present in lysates of T47D cells was investigated by adding 2 nmol of the indicated GST fusion proteins to lysates of unstimulated and EGF-stimulated T47D cells (Fig. 4). The GST-p85-SH3 domain was observed to bind to c-Cbl in lysates of both unstimulated and EGF-stimulated T47D cells (Fig. 4, lanes 7and 8). When lysates of EGF-stimulated T47D cells were used in the binding assay, there was a decrease in the amount of c-Cbl that bound to the GST-p85 SH3 domain fusion protein. We do not believe that this reflects a decrease in the amount of c-Cbl present in these cells at this time point because immunoblotting of"

HNF4α-null mice die during embryogenesis precluding the analysis of its function in the adult. To circumvent this problem, liver-specific HNF4α-null mice were produced. Mice lacking hepatic HNF4α expression exhibited increased serum ammonia and reduced serum urea. This disruption in ureagenesis may be explained by a marked decrease in expression and activity of hepatic ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC). To determine the molecular mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation of the mouse OTC gene, the OTC promoter region was analyzed. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of two putative HNF4α-binding sites in the mouse OTC promoter region. By using transient transfection analysis, it was established that high levels of promoter activity were dependent on both HNF4α-binding sites and the expression of HNF4α. Furthermore, the proximal HNF4α-binding site was found to be more important than the distal one for transactivating OTC promoter. These data demonstrate that HNF4α is critical for urea homeostasis by direct regulation of the OTC gene in vivo.

Most of these functions are achieved by hepatocytes that account for over 60% of the liver mass. The expression of genes preferentially expressed in liver is controlled by liver-enriched transcription factors (LETF)1in the HNF1, HNF3, HNF4, and C/EBP families (1Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). All of the LETFs described to date are expressed not only in the liver but also to some degree in other organs (2Xanthopoulos K.G. Prezioso V.R. Chen W.S. Sladek F.M. Cortese R. Darnell J.E., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), indicating that the expression of liver-specific genes may be regulated by a combination of LETFs. Among these transcription factors, only the expression of HNF1α and HNF4α is strictly correlated with the differentiated state of hepatoma-derived cells (3Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2257-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Re-expression of HNF4 in de-differentiated hepatoma cells is sufficient to stimulate the re-expression of many liver-specific genes (5Späth G.F. Weiss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1913-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Bailly A. Späth G. Bender V. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2411-2421PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bulla G.A. Fournier R.E.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7086-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because HNF4α is a positive regulator of HNF1α (3Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E., Jr. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), HNF4α may be a central factor among the liver-enriched transcription factors.Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α; NR2A1) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Although fatty acyl-CoA derivatives such as (C14:0)-CoA and (C16:0)-CoA were identified as positive regulators of HNF4α (8Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), they are not good candidates for classical ligands for HNF4α as assessed by structural modeling and experimental analysis (9Bogan A.A. Dallas-Yang Q. Ruse M.D., Jr. Maeda Y. Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Scanlan T.S. Cohen F.E. Sladek F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 831-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains uncertain whether specific ligands exist for HNF4α. Both tissue distribution and amino acid sequence of HNF4α have been highly conserved throughout evolution (2Xanthopoulos K.G. Prezioso V.R. Chen W.S. Sladek F.M. Cortese R. Darnell J.E., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Miquerol L. Lopez S. Cartier N.

Landers Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role for this factor from embryonic development through the adult. Indeed, targeted disruption of theHNF4α gene was found to be embryonic lethal (12Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell J.E., Jr. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). HNF4α is an essential transcription factor that regulates several serum proteins such as apolipoproteins, blood coagulation factors, P450s, hepatitis B virus, and enzymes involved in glucose, lipids, steroid, and fatty acid metabolism (11Sladek F.M. Trouche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landers Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar, 13Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 309-361Google Scholar). However, most information on HNF4α target genes is derived from in vitrostudies using cell lines and transfection and by overexpression of HNF4α. Although the majority of such in vitro studies could be confirmed in vivo, some genes that had been shown to be positively regulated by HNF4α in vitro are unaffected (apolipoproteins A-I and E) or even up-regulated (medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) in animals lacking hepatic HNF4α (14Harnish D.C.

Thus, it is important to determine whether HNF4α is actually an essential factor that regulates expression of liver-specific genes in an intact animal model.Ammonia, derived from deamination reaction of α-amino groups of amino acids, is toxic to animals. A portion of the free ammonia is excreted in the urine, but most is used in the synthesis of urea. The urea cycle is an essential pathway to eliminate ammonia through its conversion to urea (Fig. 1). Because the enzymes involved in this pathway are highly expressed in the liver, this organ has an essential role in ammonia elimination. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the second enzyme in the urea cycle, catalyzes the condensation of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline (18Grisolia S. Cohen P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 198: 561-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OTC deficiency, the most common and severe inborn error in the urea cycle, causes hyperammonemia, mental retardation, and finally death because of hyperammonemic coma (19Brusilow S.W. Horwich A.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1187-1232Google Scholar).Because HNF4α has been shown to control the expression of the ratOTC gene in vitro (20Kimura A. Nishiyori A. Murakami T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S.

Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1323-1331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), liver-specific HNF4α-null mice were examined for defects in ureagenesis. These mice exhibited high levels of serum ammonia and decreased serum urea concentrations. Furthermore, it was confirmed by using transient transfection studies that the mouse OTC is directly regulated by HNF4α. Expression levels of several key genes implicated in ureagenesis were altered in these mice. However, this phenomenon was only recapitulated at the protein levels for OTC. Thus, our data not only establish the in vivo significance of HNF4α in the control of ureagenesis but also suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms may act at other parts of this key pathway.DISCUSSIONHNF4α plays a central role in the regulation of the genes preferentially expressed in liver (1Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 11Sladek F.M. Trouche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landers Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar, 13Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 309-361Google Scholar). Because most of these results with individual gene promoters were obtained using cell culture studies and/or HNF4α-overexpression systems, it was important to determine whether they can be translated to the function of HNF4αin vivo (17Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.-H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Because the HNF4α-null mouse is embryonic lethal (12Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell J.E., Jr. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), liver-specific HNF4α-null mice were made using the Cre-loxP system to analyze the function of this factor in vivo. By using this model, HNF4α was found to be essential for lipid homeostasis (17Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.-H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Expression of apolipoprotein (apo) A-II, A-IV, C-II, C-III, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein was markedly reduced in the livers of liver-specific HNF4α-null mice. These results confirmed previous reports (30Ribeiro A. Pastier D. Kardassis D. Chambaz J. Cardot P. J. Biol.

However, apoA-I and apoE were unaffected, and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was up-regulated in liver of these mice, even though the promoters for these genes are regulated by HNF4α in transfection studies (14Harnish D.C. Malik S. Kilbourne E. Costa R. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13621-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C.

These results indicate that apoA-I and apoE may not be direct targets for HNF4α in vivo, thus emphasizing the importance for studying gene expression in an intact animal model. Because HNF4α is a central factor for the development and maintenance of liver function (35Duncan S.A. Nagy A. Chan W. Development. 1997; 124: 279-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is expected that dramatic changes in gene expression patterns would occur in the livers of liver-specific HNF4α-null mice. Thus, it is important to determine which genes are regulated directly or indirectly by HNF4α.Liver-specific HNF4α-null mice lose weight coincident with a reduction in hepatic HNF4α mRNA, and they usually exhibit a high mortality rate by 8 weeks after birth (17Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.-H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Because the expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism is drastically reduced in liver-specific HNF4α-null mice, the possibility exists that the altered maintenance of lipid homeostasis may be one reason for their low viability. However, another reason might be high levels of serum ammonia in these mice due to reduction of hepatic OTC expression. High concentrations of ammonia are known to be a neurotoxin (27Largillière C. Lancet. 1995; 345: 1113Abstract PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the levels of serum ammonia in liver-specific HNF4α-null mice were 2–3-fold higher relative to those in controls. Because OTC is expressed in both liver and intestine (21Nishiyori A. Tashiro H. Kimura A. Akagi K. Yamamura K. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1323-1331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its expression in intestine is unchanged in liver-specific HNF4α-null mice, it is conceivable that intestinal OTC has an important role in preventing the accumulation of ammonia concentrations to higher levels. On the other hand, two OTC-deficient animal models, spf andspf-ash mice that exhibit missense mutation or abnormal RNA processing, have been characterized (36Veres G. Gibbs R.A. Scherer S.E. Caskey C.T. Science. 1987; 237: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 37Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4142-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). spiff mice were shown to have 13% of hepatic OTC activity and plasma ammonia levels that were 2–3 times higher than normal (38Qureshi I.A. Rao K.V.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 420: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the levels of serum ammonia in liver-specific HNF4α-null mice are almost the same as compared with spf mice.With regard to other enzymes involved in the urea cycle, expression of the CPS-I, ASS, and arginase I mRNAs in liver of liver-specific HNF4α-null mice were ∼2-fold higher than controls, but no significant difference was detected in the protein levels with the exception of OTC. The increase of these mRNAs may reflect secondary effects caused by the reduction of OTC mRNA. Because the expression of mRNAs encoding urea cycle enzymes except OTC is reported to be increased by treatment with cAMP and/or glucocorticoids (39Nebes V.L. Morris S.M., Jr. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), these levels may increase in the livers of liver-specific HNF4α-null mice. However, ASL mRNA was reduced in the null mice to 60% as compared with controls. Other transcription factors such as C/EBPα and -β and Sp-1 are thought to regulate positively expression of these genes (40Kimura T. Christoffels V.M. Chowdhury S. Iwase K. Matsuzaki H. Mori M. Lamers W.H. Darlington G.J. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27505-27510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 41Gotoh T. Chowdhury S. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biol.

However, the expression of Sp-1 was not different and C/EBPα and -β were conversely reduced in the livers of liver-specific HNF4α-null mice as compared with controls (data not shown). Another reason for the elevated expression of CPS I, ASS, and arginase I mRNAs may be an increased DNA binding activity of these transcription factors mediated by cAMP and/or hormones. By using primary hepatocytes derived from C/EBPβ-null mice, it was reported that C/EBPβ is required for hormonal induction of the expression of CPS I and arginase I (43Kimura T. Chowdhury S. Tanaka T. Shimizu A. Iwase K. Oyadomari S. Gotoh T. Matsuzaki H. Mori M. Akira S. Takiguchi M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, HNF4α may negatively regulate the expression of CPS I, ASS, and arginase I mRNAs. However, it has not been reported that there is a HNF4α-binding site in promoter and enhancer regions of these genes. It was recently reported that activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α represses the expression of CPS I, OTC, ASS, and arginase I (44Kersten S. Mandard S. Escher P. Gonzalez F.J. Tafuri S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The increased expression of these genes is therefore consistent with the down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α mRNA in livers of liver-specific HNF4α-null mice (17Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.-H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar).The 5′-flanking region of mouse OTC genes contains sufficient elements to control OTC expression in a hepatoma cell line (45Veres G. Craigen W.J. Caskey C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7588-7591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same result was obtained in the present study using a fragment of the mouse OTC promoter region. Furthermore, it was reported that a 1.3-kbp fragment of the rat OTC promoter region is active in a hepatoma cell line (46Murakami T. Nishiyori A. Takiguchi M. Mori M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1180-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and there are two HNF4-binding sites in this promoter region (20Kimura A. Nishiyori A. Murakami T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Osumi T. Okamura R. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11125-11133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, there are also two HNF4α-binding sites in the mouse promoter. From the results using mutated constructs, the proximal HNF4α-binding site was found to be more important than the distal site. Furthermore, mutation of the distal HNF4α-binding site (−235/M1) yielded a higher activity in CV-1 cells than in HepG2 cells. These results indicate that an additional factor may be needed to activate the mouse OTC promoter in HepG2 cells, and the expression of such a factor may be lower in HepG2 cells as compared with CV-1 cells.In humans, homozygous mutations in the HNF4α gene have not been described, probably due to embryonic lethality. However, heterozygous mutations were identified in the coding regions (13Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease.

These facts indicate that HNF4α is essential for the development and maintenance of liver function in humans. Heterozygous mutations inHNF4α are known to cause maturity of onset diabetes of young 1 (MODY-1), a form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (48Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Patients with MODY-1 inherit the disease in an autosomal dominant pattern and develop symptoms under the age of 25. MODY-1 is characterized by defective secretion of insulin by the pancreatic β-cells, but the function of liver and kidney is normal as is insulin sensitivity (13Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 309-361Google Scholar, 49Hattersley A.T. Diabet. Med. 1998; 15: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recently, triglyceride and apoC-III levels were reported to be significantly reduced in these patients (50Lehto M. Bitzen P.O. Isomaa B. Wipemo C. Wessman Y. Forsblom C. Tuomi T. Taskinen M.R. Groop L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This result is in agreement with the previous study (17Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.-H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) using liver-specific HNF4α-null mice.OTC deficiency in humans is the most common inherited disease in urea cycle enzymes (19Brusilow S.W. Horwich A.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1187-1232Google Scholar). Many mutations were identified in the exons and exon/intron borders (51Tuchman M. Plante R.J. Garc ı́ a-Pérez M.A. Rubio V. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 52Matsuda I. Tanase S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 71: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but no mutations have yet been reported in the regulatory elements. However, mutations in the HNF4α-binding site were reported in other human genes, such as blood coagulation factor VII (53Arbini A.A. Pollak E.S. Bayleran J.K. High K.A. Bauer K.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 176-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IX (54Reijnen M.J. Sladek F.M. Bertina R.M. Reitsma P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brownlee G.G. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 92: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and HNF1α (57Gragnoli C. Lindner T. Cockburn B.N. Kaisaki P.J. Gragnoli F. Marozzi G. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1648-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because HNF4α-binding sites in the promoter region are critical for regulation ofOTC gene expression, any mutation in these sites could potentially cause human OTC deficiency. The liver plays an important role in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, and hormones, the synthesis and excretion of bile acids, the production of blood coagulation factors and plasma proteins, and the detoxification of various xenobiotics. Most of these functions are achieved by hepatocytes that account for over 60% of the liver mass. The expression of genes preferentially expressed in liver is controlled by liver-enriched transcription factors (LETF)1in the HNF1, HNF3, HNF4, and C/EBP families (1Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). All of the LETFs described to date are expressed not only in the liver but also to some degree in other organs (2Xanthopoulos K.G. Prezioso V.R. Chen W.S. Sladek F.M. Cortese R. Darnell J.E., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), indicating that the expression of liver-specific genes may be regulated by a combination of LETFs. Among these transcription factors, only the expression of HNF1α and HNF4α is strictly correlated with the differentiated state of hepatoma-derived cells (3Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E., Jr. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 4Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2257-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Re-expression of HNF4 in de-differentiated hepatoma cells is sufficient to stimulate the re-expression of many liver-specific genes (5Späth G.F. Weiss M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1913-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Bailly A. Späth G. Bender V. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2411-2421PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bulla G.A. Fournier R.E.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7086-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because HNF4α is a positive regulator of HNF1α (3Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E., Jr. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), HNF4α may be a central factor among the liver-enriched transcription factors. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α; NR2A1) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Although fatty acyl-CoA derivatives such as (C14:0)-CoA and (C16:0)-CoA were identified as positive regulators of HNF4α (8Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), they are not good candidates for classical ligands for HNF4α as assessed by structural modeling and experimental analysis (9Bogan A.A. Dallas-Yang Q. Ruse M.D., Jr. Maeda Y. Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Scanlan T.S. Cohen F.E. Sladek F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 831-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains uncertain whether specific ligands exist for HNF4α. Both tissue distribution and amino acid sequence of HNF4α have been highly conserved throughout evolution (2Xanthopoulos K.G. Prezioso V.R. Chen W.S. Sladek F.M. Cortese R. Darnell J.E., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3807-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Miquerol L. Lopez S. Cartier N.

Landers Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role for this factor from embryonic development through the adult. Indeed, targeted disruption of theHNF4α gene was found to be embryonic lethal (12Chen W.S. Manova K. Weinstein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell J.E., Jr. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). HNF4α is an essential transcription factor that regulates several serum proteins such as apolipoproteins, blood coagulation factors, P450s, hepatitis B virus, and enzymes involved in glucose, lipids, steroid, and fatty acid metabolism (11Sladek F.M. Trouche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landers Co., Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar, 13Sladek F.M. Seidel S.D. Burris T.P. McCabe E. Nuclear Receptors and Genetic Disease. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 309-361Google Scholar). However, most information on HNF4α target genes is derived from in vitrostudies using cell lines and transfection and by overexpression of HNF4α. Although the majority of such in vitro studies could be confirmed in vivo, some genes that had been shown to be positively regulated by HNF4α in vitro are unaffected (apolipoproteins A-I and E) or even up-regulated (medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) in animals lacking hepatic HNF4α (14Harnish D.C.

Thus, it is important to determine whether HNF4α is actually an essential factor that regulates expression of liver-specific genes in an intact animal model. Ammonia, derived from deamination reaction of α-amino groups of amino acids, is toxic to animals. A portion of the free ammonia is excreted in the urine, but most is used in the synthesis of urea. The urea cycle is an essential pathway to eliminate ammonia through its conversion to urea (Fig. 1). Because the enzymes involved in this pathway are highly expressed in the liver, this organ has an essential role in ammonia elimination. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the second enzyme in the urea cycle, catalyzes the condensation of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline (18Grisolia S. Cohen P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 198: 561-571Abstract"

Recently, for example, it was shown that the accessory Kv channel interacting proteins form complexes with Kv4 α-subunits and modulate Kv4 channel activity. The experiments reported here demonstrate that the neuronal calcium sensor protein-1 (NCS-1), another member of the recoverin-neuronal calcium sensor superfamily, is expressed in adult mouse ventricles and that NCS-1 co-immunoprecipitates with Kv4.3 from (adult mouse) ventricular extracts. In addition, co-expression studies in HEK-293 cells reveal that NCS-1 increases membrane expression of Kv4 α-subunits and functional Kv4-encoded K+ current densities. Co-expression of NCS-1 also decreases the rate of inactivation of Kv4 α-subunit-encoded K+ currents. In contrast to the pronounced effects of Kv channel interacting proteins on Kv4 channel gating, however, NCS-1 co-expression does not measurably affect the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation or the rate of recovery from inactivation of Kv4-encoded K+ currents. Taken together, these results suggest that NCS-1 is an accessory subunit of Kv4-encoded Ito,f channels that functions to regulate Ito,f density in the mammalian myocardium.

Changes in Ito,f density can result in marked alterations in action potential waveforms, influence the normal propagation of activity in the myocardium, and increase the susceptibility to lethal cardiac arrhythmias (2Antzelevitch C.

Thus, there is considerable interest in defining the molecular correlates of functional Ito,f channels and in delineating the molecular mechanisms controlling Ito,f expression in the mammalian myocardium. Importantly, considerable evidence has accumulated demonstrating that pore-forming α-subunits of the Kv4 subfamily encode cardiac Ito,f channels (6Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Circ.

The Kv channel interacting proteins (KChIPs), which are calcium-binding proteins in the recoverin-neuronal calcium sensor superfamily, have been shown to bind specifically to the N-terminal intracellular domain of Kv4 α-subunits and to affect Kv4 channel gating (14An W.F.

The experiments reported here were focused on examining the expression and the functioning of neuronal calcium sensor protein-1 (NCS-1), another member of the recoverin-neuronal calcium sensor superfamily (21Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), in the mammalian myocardium. Biochemical data are presented demonstrating that NCS-1 is highly and uniformly expressed in adult mouse ventricles and that NCS-1 co-immunoprecipitates with Kv4.3 from mouse ventricular extracts. In addition, co-expression studies revealed that NCS-1 increases functional Kv4-encoded K+ current densities and decreases the rate of current inactivation. Taken together, these observations suggest that NCS-1 is an integral component of cardiac Ito,f channels. A preliminary account of some of the findings presented here has appeared previously in abstract form (22Guo W. Brunet S. Jeromin A. Johns D.C. Nerbonne J.M. Circulation. 2001; 104: II-78Google Scholar). Lysates and membrane preparations were prepared from adult (6–8 week) C57BL6 mouse brains, ventricles, and isolated ventricular myocytes as well as from Kv4.3-expressing HEK-293 cells, using methods described previously (23Barry D.M.

The protein content of each of the solubilized samples was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were fractionated on 8–15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF membrane strips were then incubated in 0.2% I-Block (Tropix) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubations at 4 °C with a specific polyclonal anti-Kv4.3 antibody, anti-Kv4.3a (20Guo W., Li, H.

After washing, the membrane strips were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Tropix) diluted 1:5000 in the blocking buffer, and bound antibodies were detected using the CPSD® chemiluminescent alkaline phosphate substrate (Tropix).

Lett. 2000; 284: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) antibody. Following exposure to secondary antibody, protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence as described above. For immunohistochemistry, HEK-293 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Following washing with PBS, cells were placed in blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 0.02% Triton X-100 and 0.1% NaNH3) for 1 h. HEK-293 cells were then incubated with an anti-Kv4.2 antibody (20Guo W., Li, H. Aimond F. Johns D.C. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) at 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. After washing, cells were incubated with a Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Chemicon), and labeled cells were visualized under epifluorescence illumination. The recombinant adenoviral vectors, AdEGI-Kv4.2 and AdEGI-Kv4.3, were generated by Cre-lox recombination, as reported previously (26Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marbán E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hoppe U.C. Marbán E. Johns D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for mKv4.2 or mKv4.3 was cloned into the adenovirus shuttle vector pAdEGI (26Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marbán E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hoppe U.C. Marbán E. Johns D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because polycistronic vectors result in an ≈3:1 ratio of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to ion channel protein (28Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), infected cells can be readily identified under epifluorescence illumination (20Guo W., Li, H. Aimond F. Johns D.C. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The adenoviral vector AdVgRXR, encoding the ecdysone receptor, was generated by subcloning the expression cassette from pVgRXR (Invitrogen) into pAdLox. The replication-defective recombinant NCS-1 (and KChIP2) adenoviruses were constructed using methods described previously (29Romero M.I. Smith G.M. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1612-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA encoding wild-type (rat) NCS-1 (or KChIP2) was subcloned into a modified version of the pXCRSV bicistronic shuttle vector that also expresses EGFP. The resulting pXCRSV-NCS-1 (or pXCRSV-KChIP2) was then co-transfected with pBHG11ts into HEK-293 cells. Successful recombinants were identified by the cytopathic effect on HEK-293 cells and EGFP fluorescence. Transgene expression was also confirmed by Western blot analysis. Following PCR screening, recombinant viruses were plaque-purified and examined for replication-competent adenoviruses by PCR (30Zhang W. Koch P. Roth J. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 444-447PubMed Google Scholar). Plaque-purified viruses were then amplified and further purified by double cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient ultracentrifugation. The number of virus particles was determined spectrophotometrically, and the number of infectious particles was estimated by crystal violet staining using the agarose overlay method; virus concentrations were 109–1010plaque-forming units (PFUs) per ml. HEK-293 cells, obtained from the Washington University Medical School Tissue Culture Support Center, were maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 5% horse serum, 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 1 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were passaged at confluence (every 3–4 days) by brief trypsinization. In some experiments, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and Kv2.1 alone or in combination with NCS-1 or KChIP2 (and EGFP) by using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method. Approximately 16 h after the transfections, the cells were washed and allowed to recover for 20–24 h prior to electrophysiological recordings. For adenoviral infections, HEK-293 cells were transferred (∼48 h after passaging) into fresh Opti-MEM containing either the AdEGI-Kv4.2 or the AdEGI-Kv4.3 adenovirus (at 500 PFU/cell), the ecdysone receptor virus (at 50 PFU/cell), and 2% fetal calf serum. After 2 h, the infection medium was replaced with growth medium. Approximately 24 h later, cells were secondarily infected with either the NCS-1 virus (or the KChIP2 virus) at 500 PFU/cell. Kv4.x expression was then induced by addition of 5 μm muristerone A, and electrophysiological recordings were obtained ∼20–24 h later. For antisense experiments, HEK-293 cells stably expressing Kv4.3 2S. A. Malin and J. M. Nerbonne, unpublished data. were maintained in Opti-MEM selection medium, supplemented with 5% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 1 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 300 μg/ml geneticin (Sigma). Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AsODNs) targeted against the translation start sites (nucleotides 4–23) of human NCS-1 (AsODN-NCS-1, 5′-AAC TTG CTG TTG GAT TTC CC-3′) and a randomized control AsODN (5′-CAT CTT TAG AGC TGG TCC TT-3′) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. These AsODNs were synthesized with a phosphorothioate backbone and tagged at the 5′ end with Cy3 to allow visualization of uptake. For experiments, AsODNs (2 μmper 35-mm dish) were mixed with LipofectAMINE (2 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min prior to addition of the LipofectAMINE/AsODN mixture to the cells. After 12 h, the AsODN-containing medium was removed and replaced with selection medium, and the cells were harvested 24–36 h later. Whole-cell voltage-gated outward K+ currents were recorded at 25 °C from adenoviral infected EGFP-positive HEK-293 cells. The bath solution contained (in mm) 136 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose; pH 7.4. Recording pipettes contained (in mm) 135 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 5 glucose; pH 7.2. Experiments were conducted using a Dagan 3900A amplifier (Dagan Corp.), interfaced to a Gateway microcomputer equipped with a Digidata 1200 Series analog/digital interface (Axon). The pClamp 8 software package (Axon) was employed to deliver voltage steps and to record electrophysiological data. From a holding potential of −70 mV, voltage-gated outward K+ currents were evoked during the 400-ms depolarizing voltage steps to potentials between −40 and +60 mV; voltage steps were applied in 10-mV increments at 15-s intervals. To determine the rates of recovery from steady-state inactivation, cells were first depolarized to +50 mV for 400 ms to inactivate the currents (conditioning pulses), subsequently hyperpolarized to −70 or −90 mV for varying times ranging from 5 ms to 2 s, and finally stepped to +50 mV for 400 ms (test pulses) to activate the currents and assess the extent of recovery. The voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation were also examined using a two-pulse protocol; 1-s prepulses to potentials between −110 and +30 mV followed by a 400-ms test pulse to +50 mV were used. Experimental data were acquired at variable sampling frequencies, and current signals were filtered on-line at 5 kHz prior to digitization and storage. Analysis of electrophysiological data was completed using Clampfit 6.0.5 (Axon). The decay phases of the voltage-activated, Kv4.x-encoded outward K+ currents in HEK-293 cells were well described by single exponentials at all test potentials. In addition, as reported previously (14An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J., Li, H.-P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J.

Res. 2002; 90: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the inactivation time constants for the Kv4.x-encoded K+currents do not display any appreciable voltage dependence. The mean ± S.E. decay time constants (τdecay) reported here (Table I) were determined from fits of the decay phases of the currents evoked at +40 mV. To determine the kinetics of recovery (from steady-state inactivation) of the Kv4-encoded K+ currents, the pulse protocol described above was used, and the amplitudes of peak outward K+ currents evoked during the test pulses (in each cell) were measured and normalized to the amplitude of the peak current determined during the conditioning pulse (in the same cell). Data obtained from several cells were pooled, and mean ± S.E. normalized recovery data were plotted against the interpulse interval and fitted with single exponential functions.Table IEffects of NCS-1 and KChIP2 on Kv4-encoded K + currents in HEK-293 cellsKv4.2Kv4.3Control+NCS-1+KChIP2Control+NCS-1+KChIP2τdecay (ms)46 ± 464 ± 31-aValue is significantly different from control at the p < 0.01 level.85 ± 51-aValue is significantly different from control at the p < 0.01 level.102 ± 6141 ± 131-bValue is significantly different from control at the p < 0.05 level.135 ± 101-bValue is significantly different from control at the p < 0.05 level.τrecovery (ms)260 ± 211-cDetermined at a holding potential of −70 mV.244 ± 271-cDetermined at a holding potential of −70 mV.69 ± 51-aValue is significantly different from control at the p < 0.01 level.190 ± 121-cDetermined at a holding potential of −70 mV.168 ± 191-cDetermined at a holding potential of −70 mV.63 ± 61-aValue is significantly different from control at the p < 0.01 level.1-cDetermined at a holding potential of −70 mV.133 ± 121-dDetermined at a holding potential of −90 mV.153 ± 141-dDetermined at a holding potential of −90 mV.25 ± 31-aValue is significantly different from control at the p < 0.01 level.1-dDetermined at a holding potential of −90 mV.95 ± 101-dDetermined at a holding potential of −90 mV.102 ± 141-dDetermined at a holding potential of −90 mV.36 ± 41-aValue is significantly different from control at the p < 0.01 level.1-dDetermined at a holding potential of −90 mV.

Open table in a new tab The voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation of the Kv4-encoded K+ currents were obtained by normalizing the peak current amplitudes determined for the currents evoked at +50 mV from each conditioning potential to the maximal amplitude of current evoked from the conditioning prepulse of −110 mV (determined in the same cell). Data from several cells were pooled, and the mean ± S.E. normalized data were plotted as a function of the prepulse potential and fitted with a Boltzmann equation: I/Imax = 1/(1 + exp((V m −V 12)/k)), where V 12is the voltage (V m ) at which 50% of the channels are inactivated, and k is a slope factor. All data are presented as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of observed differences between groups of cells was evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance followed by Student- Newman-Keuls test; p values are presented in the text, and statistical significance was set at the p < 0.05 level. Western blot analysis of fractionated adult mouse brain and ventricular lysates probed with the anti-NCS-1 antibody revealed the presence of a single ≈25-kDa band in both the brain (B) and the ventricular (V) samples (Fig.1 A). Importantly, robust expression of NCS-1 was also evident in Western blots of lysates from isolated mouse ventricular myocytes (M) (Fig.1 A), indicating that the expression of NCS-1 evident in ventricular lysates (V) arises predominantly, if not exclusively, from cardiac myocytes, rather than from non-myocytes, such as intracardiac neurons. In addition, Western blots of lysates prepared from the right ventricle (RV), the left ventricular apex (A), and the ventricular septum (S) reveal that NCS-1 is expressed at similar levels throughout the ventricles of the adult mouse myocardium (Fig. 1 B). The KChIPs are members of the recoverin-neuronal calcium sensor superfamily, which also includes frequenin, NCS-1, recoverin, calmodulin, neurocalcin, and hippocalcin (21Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Recent studies (14An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J., Li, H.-P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W.

It has also been shown that the KChIPs co-immunoprecipate with Kv4.x α-subunits from adult rat and mouse brain (14An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J., Li, H.-P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I.

To explore the possibility that NCS-1 is also associated with Kv4.x α-subunits in (mouse) cardiomyocytes in situ, adult mouse ventricular proteins were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Kv4.3 antibody, Kv4.3b, shown previously (20Guo W., Li, H.

The resulting immunoprecipitates were then fractionated and probed with another anti-Kv4.3-specific antibody anti-Kv4.3a (20Guo W., Li, H. Aimond F. Johns D.C. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. Nerbonne J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2036391390,"In this study we found that Tat protected vincristine-treated Kaposi's sarcoma cells from apoptosis and from down-regulation of several anti-apoptotic genes such as<i>AKT-1, AKT-2</i>, <i>BCL2</i>,<i>BCL-XL</i>, and insulin-like growth factor I and induced the<i>de novo</i> expression of the interleukin-3 gene. Moreover, we found that Tat enhanced phosphorylation of AKT and BAD proteins. The inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with two unrelated pharmacological inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, abrogated both the anti-apoptotic effect and the phosphorylation of AKT induced by Tat. After treatment with Tat, the AKT enzymatic activity showed a biphasic increase: an early activation (15 min), independent from protein synthesis; and a delayed activation (24 h), which was significantly decreased upon blockage of protein synthesis. Experiments with a function blocking anti-vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-2 antibody suggested that both the early and delayed AKT activation and the protection from apoptosis were triggered by the interaction of Tat with vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-2. Moreover, experiments with function-blocking antibodies directed against insulin-like growth factor I/insulin-like growth factor I receptor or interleukin-3 indicated their involvement in the delayed activation of AKT and their contribution to the anti-apoptotic effect of Tat on vincristine-treated Kaposi's sarcoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068690203,"Polo-like kinases (Plks) control multiple important events during M phase progression, but little is known about their activation during the cell cycle. The activities of both mammalian Plk1 and Xenopus Plx1 peak during M phase, and this activation has been attributed to phosphorylation. However, no phosphorylation sites have previously been identified in any member of the Plk family. Here we have combined tryptic phosphopeptide mapping with mass spectrometry to identify four major phosphorylation sites in Xenopus Plx1. All four sites appear to be phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Phosphorylations at two sites (Ser-260 and Ser-326) most likely represent autophosphorylation events, whereas two other sites (Thr-201 and Ser-340) are targeted by upstream kinases. Several recombinant kinases were tested for their ability to phosphorylate Plx1 in vitro. Whereas xPlkk1 phosphorylated primarily Thr-10, Thr-201 was readily phosphorylated by protein kinase A, and Cdk1/cyclin B was identified as a likely kinase acting on Ser-340. Phosphorylation of Ser-340 was shown to be responsible for the retarded electrophoretic mobility of Plx1 during M phase, and phosphorylation of Thr-201 was identified as a major activating event."

MODY1 is caused by mutation in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). To understand better the MODY1 phenotype, we tested whether HNF4α was able to modulate directly the insulin gene promoter. Transfection of cultured 293T cells with an HNF4α expression vector led to 10-fold activation of a cotransfected reporter plasmid containing the rat insulin I gene promoter. Computer analysis revealed a potential HNF4α-binding site between nucleotides −57 and −69 of the promoter; mutation of this sequence led to reduced ability of HNF4α to activate the promoter. The ability of HNF4α to bind this sequence was confirmed using gel shift analysis. In transfected INS-1 beta cells, mutation of either the HNF1α site or the HNF4α site in the insulin gene promoter led to 50–75% reduction in reporter gene activity; expression of dominant negative HNF4α led to significant reduction in the activity of wild type and both mutated promoters. Thus, in addition to the previously described indirect action of HNF4α on insulin gene expression mediated through elevated HNF1α levels, HNF4α also activates the insulin gene directly, through a previously unrecognized cis element.

Most likely, additional transcription factors participate in achieving specificity. MODY1 is a monogenic form of diabetes characterized by impaired glucose-dependent insulin secretion in the absence of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (11Herman W.H. Fajans S.S. Ortiz F.J.

This indicates that a beta cell defect is the primary cause of MODY and implies that MODY genes have a role in insulin production and/or secretion. Consistent with this is the fact that four of the five known MODY subtypes are caused by mutations in distinct transcription factors expressed in pancreatic beta cells (13Shih D.Q. Stoffel M. Proc.

The striking MODY phenotype caused by such single gene disorders provides clear evidence of the important role of each of these transcription factors in beta cell function. MODY1 is caused by mutation in HNF4α, a transcription factor of the nuclear receptor subfamily (14Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S. Signorini S. Stoffel M.

Like HNF4α, HNF1α is expressed in liver and beta cells. In fact, HNF1αwas shown to be a direct transcriptional target of HNF4α in liver (24Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mutation in the HNF4α-binding site in theHNF1α gene promoter produces a MODY phenotype (25Gragnoli C. Lindner T. Cockburn B.N. Kaisaki P.J. Gragnoli F. Marozzi G. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1648-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, MODY1 and MODY3 show a similar clinical phenotype. Recent studies (26Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that induction of dominant negative (DN) HNF1α in beta cells leads to alterations in expression of a number of beta cell genes including the insulin gene. Because DN-HNF4α led to reduced activity of the Hnf1αpromoter and reduced insulin mRNA levels (27Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that HNF4α increases insulin mRNA levels indirectly by increasing HNF1α levels, which in turn activate the promoter through binding to an HNF1α consensus sequence (28Emens L.A. Landers D.W. Moss L.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7300-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently, however, strong evidence has been obtained indicating that this hypothesis may be an over-simplification and that the actual relationship between HNF4α and HNF1α may be more complex; it has been shown (29Boj S.F.

Therefore, activation of beta cell genes by HNF4α may involve more than a simple transcriptional regulatory cascade mediated through HNF1α, as previously envisaged. In this study, we have examined this idea through a detailed analysis of the insulin gene promoter. In addition to confirming that HNF4α activates insulin gene expression in an indirect fashion, through an HNF1α-binding site, we have identified a novel cis element in the insulin gene promoter, which mediates direct activation of the promoter by HNF4α in beta cells. 293T, HeLa S3 Tet-Off (CLONTECH PT3001–1), and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (200 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml).

The nucleotides mutated (−57 to −69) were ACGGCAAAGTCCA to CATTACCCTGAAC. pGL3.ΔHNF1Synt.LUC was generated by subcloning of the mutated insulin promoter from −410MFInsLUC to pGL3-promoter vector (Promega).

Transfections of 293T, HeLa, and COS7 cells were carried out by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique (32Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cells were suspended in 450 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline (calcium/magnesium-free), and plasmid DNA dissolved in 50 μl of H2O was added. Cells were incubated on ice for 10 min, then transferred to 4-mm gap cuvettes (BTX), and pulsed for 6 ms at 320 V/cm, 975 microfarads using an ECM 830 pulse generator. For induction of DN-HNF4α, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h prior to transfection. Following transfection, cell extracts were prepared by 3 cycles of freeze-thawing, followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. The firefly and Renilla luciferase assays were carried out as follows: extracts containing 5–50 μg (2–5 μl) of protein were added to 50 μl of firefly luciferase assay buffer (Promega E1501) or 100 μl of Renilla luciferase assay buffer (33Lorenz W.W.

The samples were placed in a luminometer (LUMAC Biocounter M2500), and light output was determined over a 10-s interval. Statistical significance was evaluated by t test using InStat software. Oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to the HNF4α binding element (HBE) region (5′-gatccGCCCTTAATGGGCCAAACGGCAAAGTCCAGGGa-3′) from the rat insulin I promoter (5Karlsson O. Edlund T. Moss J.B. Rutter W.J. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Radioactive probes were generated by incubation of the appropriate annealed oligonucleotides (5 pmol) in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), 0.25 mm dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 5 units of DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs, Klenow fragment) for 40 min at room temperature. The radiolabeled oligonucleotides were separated from free nucleotide by spin dialysis using Sephadex G-50. Specific activity obtained was typically ∼2,000 cpm/fmol. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of expression plasmids as described above. Whole cell extracts (10–15 μg of protein) were incubated for 10 min on ice in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2) containing 600 ng of poly(dI·dC) and 600 ng of poly(dA·dT) (Sigma) in a final assay volume of 14 μl. Subsequently, 1 μl of 32P-labeled probe was added (∼10 fmol), and incubation was allowed to continue on ice for an additional 25 min. Samples were subsequently resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA (0.5× TBE) at 184 V for 2 h at 4 °C. The gel was dried, and the labeled DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. In supershift experiments, 1 μl of anti-HNF4α antiserum or preimmune serum was added after the first 10 min of incubation, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min before addition of the32P-labeled probe. Because HNF4α was previously shown to affect insulin mRNA levels in beta cells (27Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), its involvement in the direct transcriptional regulation of the insulin gene was examined. 293T cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid encoding the luciferase gene controlled by the rat insulin I gene promoter (−410 to −1) in the presence or absence of an HNF4α expression plasmid. For comparison, cells were also transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids controlled by no promoter or by other promoters as follows: RSV, β-actin, CMV.TK, and SV40 in the presence or absence of HNF4α expression plasmid. HNF4α activated transcription of the insulin gene promoter 9.5-fold (Fig.1) but did not activate the other promoters tested, indicating that this activation is specific. Similar results were obtained upon transfection of HeLa cells (not shown). In order to characterize further this HNF4α-dependent activation, the insulin gene promoter was scanned for the presence of an HNF4α consensus binding sequence using TESS software (www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess). Such a consensus site was found between nucleotides −57 and −69 (Fig.2), suggesting the presence of an HNF4α-binding site in the promoter of the insulin gene. To determine whether this putative HNF4α-binding site is necessary for HNF4α activation of the insulin gene promoter, we examined the ability of HNF4α to activate the insulin gene promoter mutated at this site. Four block replacement mutants of the insulin promoter, spanning the consensus binding sequence and designated Synt 5–8, were used (5Karlsson O. Edlund T. Moss J.B. Rutter W.J. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8819-8823Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). As before, 293T cells were transfected with reporter plasmids encoding the luciferase gene controlled by the wild type rat insulin I promoter or by one of its mutated variants, Synt 5–8, in the presence or absence of HNF4α expression plasmid. HNF4α activation of mutants Synt 5 and Synt 8, in which mutations are located outside the putative HNF4α-binding site, was not reduced compared with wild type promoter activation. In contrast, mutation Synt 6 and Synt 7, each abolishing a part of the HNF4α consensus site, showed significantly attenuated activation (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the nucleotides mutated in mutants Synt 6 and Synt 7 are important for HNF4α activation of the insulin gene promoter.Figure 3Block replacement mutations in the HNF4α consensus binding site in the insulin gene promoter reduce HNF4α activation of the promoter. 293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of luciferase (LUC) reporter plasmid containing the wild type rat insulin I promoter or each of the block replacement mutants Synt 5–8 in the presence of 1 μg of HNF4α expression plasmid (pcDNA3.HNF4α) or empty expression plasmid control. The nucleotides mutated in Synt 5–8 are −43 to −53, −54 to −63, −64 to −68, and −79 to −88, respectively (5Karlsson O. Edlund T. Moss J.B. Rutter W.J. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8819-8823Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity observed in the presence as compared to the absence of HNF4α. Each data point represents the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent transfection experiments for each reporter plasmid.Asterisks indicate statistical significance (p = 0.024 for Synt 6 and p = 0.0006 for Synt 7) compared with the values obtained for wild type promoter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested the ability of HNF4α to bind to the putative binding sequence in the insulin gene promoter. An EMSA was performed using a probe containing the putative HNF4α-binding site, designated the HBE element (Fig. 2). Whole cell extracts were made from HeLa cells transfected with HNF4α expression plasmid and from untransfected HeLa cells. Incubation of transfected extracts with the radiolabeled HBE probe resulted in a strong band that was absent when extracts from mock-transfected cells were used (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 2). Competition with unlabeled HBE oligonucleotide abolished this band (lane 3). Addition of anti-HNF4α serum generated a supershifted band that was not observed with preimmune serum, confirming the presence of HNF4α in the complex (lanes 4 and 5). Apolipoprotein C III (ApoCIII) is a well characterized target gene of HNF4α (35Costa R.H. Van Dyke T.A. Yan C. Kuo F. Darnell J.E., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6589-6593Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Ladias J.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol.

Competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the C3P element, an HNF4α-binding site in the ApoCIII gene promoter (37Leff T. Reue K. Melian A. Culver H. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16132-16137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also abolished the observed band (lane 6). Competition with increasing amounts of unlabeled HBE and C3P probes indicates that HNF4α affinity to its binding site inApoCIII gene is higher than its affinity to the binding site in the insulin gene (Fig. 4 B).

Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2199-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This implies that additional factor(s), present in beta cells, may be important for insulin gene regulation. In light of our data showing that HNF4α can bind and activate the insulin gene promoter, its possible cooperation with the other three known insulin gene transcription factors was examined. 293T cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid controlled by the rat insulin I gene promoter and with expression plasmids encoding the four transcription factors E2A, BETA2, PDX1, and HNF4α. Expression of HNF4α with E2A, BETA2, and PDX1 produced a synergistic activation of the insulin gene promoter that was ∼2-fold higher than the activation generated by the three factors alone (Fig. 5 A). Similar results were obtained upon transfecting HeLa cells (not shown). To investigate further this augmented activation generated by HNF4α, the effect of HNF4α and PDX1 was tested in the absence of E2A and BETA2. 293T cells were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid encoding the luciferase gene controlled by the rat insulin I promoter and with expression vectors encoding PDX1 and HNF4α. Expression of HNF4α and PDX1 generated synergistic activation of the promoter (Fig.5 B). Synergistic activation was also observed in HeLa cells (not shown). This cooperativity of HNF4α with PDX1 is probably responsible for the synergistic activation observed previously upon coexpression of HNF4α with E2A, BETA2, and PDX1. Expression of dominant negative HNF1α in the beta cell line INS-1 reduced the expression of several beta cell genes, including the insulin gene (26Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and has similar effects to that of dominant negative HNF4α (27Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HNF4α is a transcription activator of HNF1α (24Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 27Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and mutations in HNF1α are responsible for MODY3 (23Yamagata K. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Furuta H. Vaxillaire M. Southam L. Cox R.D. Lathrop G.M. Boriraj V.V. Chen X. Cox N.J. Oda Y. Yano H., Le, B.M. Yamada S. Nishigori H. Takeda J. Fajans S.S. Hattersley A.T. Iwasaki N. Hansen T. Pedersen O. Polonsky K.S. Turner R.C. Velho G. Chevere J.C. Froguel P. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that HNF4α may activate the insulin gene indirectly, through Hnf1α gene function. In non-beta cells, the HNF4α-dependent activation we observed (Fig. 1) may be mediated in part through HNF1α, but the substantial reduction in the activation of promoter mutated in the HNF4α-binding site (Fig. 3) indicates that a significant portion of the effect is mediated directly. To assess the significance of the HNF4α site in the insulin gene promoter in beta cells, and to test whether in beta cells HNF4α activates the insulin gene promoter directly or indirectly through HNF1α, we used INS-1 DN-HNF4α 26 cells, a derivative of INS-1 cells that contains a plasmid encoding doxycycline-inducible dominant negative HNF4α (27Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This dominant negative protein possesses a functional dimerization domain but lacks a DNA binding domain and therefore suppresses activity of the endogenous wild type HNF4α. Luciferase reporter plasmids controlled by wild type rat insulin I gene promoter or by promoter mutated either in HNF1α- or HNF4α-binding sites were electroporated into these cells. In the absence of doxycycline (i.e. no expression of DN-HNF4α), mutations in either the HNF4α site or the HNF1α site led to reduced activity of the insulin gene promoter (Fig.6 A). Thus both sites are important for full transcriptional activation in beta cells. To confirm the role of HNF4α and to distinguish between a direct action of HNF4α as compared with an indirect action mediated through HNF1α, we compared the activity of wild type and mutated promoters in the presence and absence of doxycycline. If HNF4α acts exclusively in an indirect manner, through HNF1α, induction of DN-HNF4α should not affect the activity of promoter mutated at the HNF1α site. In fact, induction of DN-HNF4α significantly reduced the activity of both the wild type promoter and promoter mutated in the HNF1α-binding site (Fig. 6 A), confirming the involvement of HNF4α in insulin promoter activation, and showing that at least part of this effect does not involve HNF1α. Furthermore, expression of DN-HNF4α led to significant reduction in activity of a promoter fragment mutated in the HNF4α site (Fig. 6 A), confirming that HNF4α also increases insulin gene transcription through an indirect effect via HNF1α (Fig. 6 B). Although this experimental system does not permit quantitative comparison of the relative contribution of the direct effects as compared with the indirect effects of HNF4α, the significant DN-HNF4α-dependent reduction in observed activity for both the ΔHNF1 and ΔHNF4 promoter clearly indicates that both effects are substantial. Identification of HNF1α and HNF4α as the mutated genes responsible for MODY3 and MODY1, respectively, has prompted efforts to establish the precise role of these factors in health and disease. Because the MODY phenotype involves a primary defect in beta cells, the defective function of these transcription factors must be manifested in these cells. Indeed, expression of DN-HNF1α and DN-HNF4α leads to clear alterations in expression of key beta cell genes, including the insulin gene (26Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because previous studies have shown that HNF4α is an activator of HNF1α (24Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and that MODY3 can be caused by mutation in an HNF4α-binding site in the HNF1α promoter (25Gragnoli C. Lindner T. Cockburn B.N. Kaisaki P.J. Gragnoli F. Marozzi G. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1648-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the effect of HNF4α on the insulin gene promoter is indirect, mediated through activation of HNF1α (27Wang H. Maechler P. Antinozzi P.A. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35953-35959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined the above hypothesis. Expression of DN-HNF4α in beta cells led to reduced activity of both wild type insulin gene promoter and promoter mutated in the HNF1α-binding site, strongly suggesting the presence of an HNF4α-binding site elsewhere in the promoter region. Indeed, we identified such a sequence between nucleotides −57 and −69 of the promoter, and we were able to show that it is capable of binding HNF4α in vitro. We further showed that this site is essential for full activation of the promoter in beta cells and for efficient HNF4α-dependent activation in non-beta cells. Expression of DN-HNF4α in beta cells also led to reduced activity of a promoter construct bearing mutations in the HNF4α site. The data therefore indicate that in addition to the previously recognized indirect action of HNF4α on insulin gene expression mediated through HNF1α, there is also a direct action mediated through binding to the novel HNF4α consensus sequence in the promoter.

It has been shown that the Hnf4α promoter contains an upstream beta cell-specific promoter whose activity is regulated by HNF1α. This promoter also contains a binding site for PDX1, mutations in which strongly correlate with the diabetic phenotype in a MODY family (30Thomas H. Jaschkowitz K. Bulman M. Frayling T.M.

Taken together, the data are consistent with the idea that HNF1α, HNF4α, and PDX1 participate in a complex autoregulatory transcriptional network that controls many of the functional properties of developing and mature beta cells. Of central importance in this regard is the insulin gene, whose expression is modulated by all three factors. Interestingly, we have observed synergistic activation of the insulin gene promoter by HNF4α and PDX1, which have adjacent binding sites in this promoter, thus adding an additional level of complexity to the transcriptional control network. The current results indicating that HNF4α activates the insulin gene through both direct and indirect actions will permit a more detailed understanding of the MODY phenotype. We thank D.

The relevance of these additional interactions to native channels is still uncertain. Despite the structural similarities between KCNE1 and KCNE3, the functional consequences of their association with KvLQT1 are distinctly different. The dramatically different effects of KCNE1 and KCNE3 on KvLQT1 provide a powerful tool to investigate how the KCNEs control K+ channel activity. Using KCNE1/KCNE3 chimeras, we have previously shown that a three-amino acid segment, the “activation triplet,” within the transmembrane domain of minK is sufficient and necessary to confer the specificity of KCNE control of voltage-dependent channel activation (20Melman Y.F. Domenech A. de la Luna S. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6439-6444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our findings also showed that different regions of the KCNE proteins are responsible for different functions, namely the modulation of kinetics of activation and deactivation. In this paper, we refine our investigation of the role of individual amino acids within the KCNE activation triplet and show that the central residue is largely responsible for differences in activation kinetics between KCNE1 and KCNE3. By substituting homologous residues at this site, we identify structural requirements for minKversus KCNE3-like kinetics. This work provides more precise information on structural requirements and specificity of KCNE interaction and control of voltage-gated K+ channels. CHO1 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin and/or streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Gene transfer was performed using 15 μg of Qiagen Midiprep-purified plasmid DNA. Cells were electroporated at 225 V, 72 ohm, and 1800 microfarads with cytomix media. We performed electrophysiology studies 24–48 h after transfection. Molar ratios of 7:7:2 of kvlqt1:KCNE:green fluorescence protein plasmid were used to allow identification of transfected cells by fluorescence. We used the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique (21Hammill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) to measure K+ currents carried by the heterologously expressed recombinant channels. The details of the techniques were identical to those described previously (20Melman Y.F. Domenech A. de la Luna S. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6439-6444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All mutants were constructed using a variation of the QuikChange (Stratagene) PCR-based site directed mutagenesis system as previously described (20Melman Y.F. Domenech A. de la Luna S. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6439-6444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The sequence of the wild-type KCNE1 region is ctgggattcttcggcttcttcactctgggcatcatgctgagctac, and the sequence of KCNE3 region is gtcatgttcctatttgctgtaactgtcggcagcctcatcctgggatac. Codons 57–59 of minK and 71–73 of KCNE3 are underlined. Primer pairs consisted of this sequence and its reverse complement with the desired mutations within the underlined stretches. We chose specific sequences based on standard human codon usage tables to introduce the desired mutations. As we previously showed (20Melman Y.F. Domenech A. de la Luna S. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6439-6444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the kinetics and voltage dependence of activation, current density, and the appearance of a constitutively activated component of current from KvLQT1 are dependent on the co-expression of minK (KCNE1) or KCNE3 (Fig.1, a–c). We also showed that a stretch of three amino acids within the transmembrane domain of KCNE1 and KCNE3 was both necessary and sufficient to confer the unique properties of current activation on KvLQT1. Specifically, the substitution of KCNE1 residues 57–59 into KCNE3 produced a current that is voltage-dependent and activated slowly whereas the converse transplantation of KCNE3 residues 71–73 into KCNE1 yielded a more rapidly activating current with an additional component of constitutively active voltage-independent current (Fig. 1 d). To examine the contributions of each amino acid within the triplet toward control of channel gating, we constructed all six possible single and double swaps of KCNE1 residues 57–59 into the corresponding region of KCNE3 (residues 71–73). The mutants were examined for their ability to produce currents resembling either minK·KvLQT1 or KCNE3·KvLQT1 complexes. Specifically, we asked whether the currents exhibited slow sigmoidal activation kinetics of KvLQT1-minK channels or rapid monoexponential activation plus a voltage-independent component characteristic of KvLQT1·KCNE3 channels. Fig. 1, e–i, shows currents from KCNE3 with minK-substituted amino acids within the activation triplet. All of the mutants containing the substitution V72T, either alone (Fig.1 e) or in combination with another residue within the triplet (Fig. 1, g and i), abolished the usual KCNE3-mediated constitutive current and exhibited slow sigmoidal-type activation kinetics that resemble minK. In contrast, the substitution of the other residues within the triplet did not eliminate the constitutively activated voltage-independent current (Fig. 1,d, f, and h), and monoexponential activation was seen. These results suggest that the specific control of activation by the KCNE proteins may be largely confined to just one amino acid, Thr-58, of minK (Val-72 of KCNE3). However, some contribution to activation gating by the two flanking residues is evident as seen in Fig. 1 h (KCNE3 T71F/G73L) where there is a slow but non-sigmoidal component of activation in addition to the constitutively active current. To test our hypothesis of the critical role of residue Val-72 of KCNE3, we constructed KCNE3 mutants A69T KCNE3 and L75T KCNE3. These two mutants contain a threonine located one turn up (N terminus) or one turn down the transmembrane α-helix of minK and, hence, would face the same direction as the threonine in V72T KCNE3. In contrast to the dramatic effects of the substitution of threonine at position 72 of KCNE3 (Fig. 1 b), the substitution at positions 69 and 75 had virtually no effect on KCNE3 gating (Fig. 3, a and b). To confirm this single amino acid hypothesis, we substituted KCNE3 amino acids into the activation triplet of minK (residues 57–59). The insertion of the first and/or third residues (threonine and glycine) of the triplet into KCNE1 did not reproduce the kinetics seen with KCNE3 (Fig. 2 b). When the central valine of KCNE3 was substituted into minK with either of the flanking residues of KCNE3, the slow sigmoidal activation of minK was replaced by rapid monoexponential activation (Fig. 2, a andc). When the central valine was inserted alone or with threonine in position one there appeared a distinct constitutively active voltage-independent component (Fig. 2, a andd). A further examination of T58V revealed that the voltage-independent component could be diminished or eliminated and the activation could be slowed by administering a preconditioning hyperpolarization pulse (−120 mV for 3 s) rather than the more physiological holding potential (− 80 mV) (Fig. 2 d). TheV h of the voltage-activated component of this mutant is not significantly left-shifted relative to minK (T58V, 27.7 ± 1.01 mV, n = 10, versus WT minK, 30.3 ± 3.1 mV, n = 10). Therefore a simple left-shifted activation process that leaves channels open at hyperpolarized potentials does not account for this conditional voltage-independent state but rather represents a distinct and stable open state that arises, which arises from our mutation. We also introduced threonines into T58V minK at positions 55 and 61, one turn N- or C-terminal to residue 58, respectively. Similar to our results with KCNE3, the mutation of Gly-55 failed to restore minK-like gating (Fig. 3 c). However, the insertion of a threonine at position 61 had a more pronounced effect and produced currents resembling minK (Fig. 3 d), which contained both less constitutive current and slower activation kinetics (Fig. 3, e and f). Thus, although the precise position of threonine is critical for its function in generating minK-like currents, this function may be possible from spatially proximal positions as well. We further investigated the role of the middle residue within the KCNE triplet by making both conservative and divergent amino acid substitutions. Specifically, we altered the bulkiness of the side chain using both larger (isoleucine) and smaller (alanine) aliphatic and polar residues (serine and threonine). In substituting the hydroxylated residue serine into KCNE3 (V72S), we observed slow voltage-dependent activation with sigmoidal kinetics and no voltage-independent constitutive current (Fig.4 a). This current was nearly identical to that produced by the V72T KCNE3 mutant, suggesting the need for a hydroxyl group at this position in producing slow sigmoidal voltage-dependent activation. The support for this hypothesis comes from V72C-KCNE3. Cysteine is isoelectric with serine, but currents are almost completely voltage-independent and resemble KCNE3 (Fig. 4 b). V72I-KCNE3, a mutant that introduces a larger aliphatic residue, retained voltage-independent current and rapid activation characteristic of KCNE3 (Fig. 4 d). The substitution of the smaller aliphatic amino acid, alanine at this position results in decreased voltage-independent constitutive current and slower activation kinetics (Fig. 4 c). This finding suggests that a minimal size of hydrophobic residue is necessary to keep the channel open during hyperpolarized potentials; conversely, hydroxylation eliminates this voltage-independent state entirely. That two sets of isosteric residues (threonine and valine, cysteine and serine) gave dramatically different currents solely with the introduction of a hydroxyl group suggests that this group has an important role in control KvLQT1 gating. We investigated this possibility further by substituting into the central position of KCNE3 tyrosine, a residue that is both bulky and hydroxylated and where the hydroxyl group is at a different spacing from the carbon backbone than serine or threonine. Although V72Y KCNE3 has both rapid and slow activation, there is a significant voltage-independent component and no sigmoidal minK-like kinetics (Fig. 4 e), suggesting that a hydrophobic group keeps the channel open in a voltage-independent manner and that precise spacing of the hydroxyl group is necessary to produce activation kinetics typical of Iks. We made comparable mutations in minK and observed similar trends. The substitution of neither serine nor alanine caused voltage-independent current (Fig. 4, f and g, respectively), in parallel to the findings with KCNE3. The activation kinetics of these two mutants (T58A minK and T58S minK) are accelerated relative to minK as estimated by rise times to half-maximum following an 80-mV depolarization (t 12 of minK = 706 ± 27 (n = 10), T58A minK = 314 ± 15 (n = 6), T58S minK = 358 ± 14 (n = 12)) (Fig. 3, f and g). However, T58A minK exhibits a non-sigmoidal activation of current (Fig.4 g), whereas T58S minK has a sigmoidal time course similar to wild type minK (Fig. 4 f), illustrating the importance of the hydroxyl group in reproducing minK-like activation kinetics. The mutations at minK position Thr-58 that introduced non-hydroxylated groups of various sizes exhibited prepulse-dependent constitutive opening (Fig. 5,a–d). The substitution of isoleucine produced a voltage-independent constitutive component that could be decreased by prolonged hyperpolarizations in a manner that is similar to the current seen with the T58V substitution. We also found that T58C minK behaves in a similar manner. Comparable with substitutions at the central position in KCNE3, T58S minK and T58C minK reveals that two isoelectric residues exhibit markedly different characteristics, further supporting the importance of an appropriately spaced hydroxylated side chain in producing Iks-like activation. In our previous work, we showed that the activation triplet of minK and KCNE3 did not control KvLQT1 deactivation kinetics (20Melman Y.F. Domenech A. de la Luna S. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6439-6444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Specifically, the slowed deactivation kinetics of minK·KvLQT1 complexes are not observed when minK residues 57–59 are inserted into KCNE3, despite the slowing of activation kinetics. Therefore, we examined the deactivation properties of the site-directed mutants presented here. Wild type KvLQT1-KCNE1 and KvLQT1-KCNE3 channels close with a monoexponential time course after the removal of the depolarizing stimulus (Fig.5 f). Consistent with our previous work, most mutations within the activation triplet did not affect deactivation kinetics of the parent KCNE backbone, and deactivation kinetics are comparable with the wild type protein (Fig. 5 f). However, the deactivation kinetics of T58V minK, T58I minK and T58C minK, and T71F/G73L KCNE3 could not be fit to a monoexponential time course. Each of these mutants deactivates with a time course best fit with two time constants (Fig. 5, e and f). Each of these mutants was also previously observed to have a voltage-independent component that could be eliminated or reduced by prolonged hyperpolarizing conditioning pulses. The V h of the voltage-dependent component of these minK mutants was not left-shifted to an extent that would account for the constitutive current we observed (T58VminK V h = 27.7 ± 1.07 (n = 10), T58I minK V h = 26.7 ± 1.07 (n = 4), T58C minKV h = −8.5 mV ± 1.5 (n = 13), T71F/G73L KCNE3 −14.93 ± 1.4 mV (n = 7)versus KvLQT1 alone, V h = −15.2 ± 0.3 mV (n = 10), which shows no such prepulse dependence) and thus cannot be explained merely by a hyperpolarizing shift in activation gating. The bi-exponential deactivation kinetics reflects two open states and supports this hypothesis. The faster time constant represents closure of the voltage-dependent open state, and relaxation of an apparent “inducible” voltage dependence is reflected in the decay of current on a much slower time scale. Significantly, the recording of deactivation kinetics under conditions of prolonged hyperpolarizing prepulses converted the deactivation kinetics to a mono-exponential time course, as if hyperpolarization eliminated one of the open states (Fig. 5 e, right trace). In this work, we have refined our understanding of the structural determinants for functional specificity of the KCNE proteins within a previously mapped activation triplet of amino acids in the transmembrane domain. We show that the central residue of the triplet (T58 for minK or V72 for KCNE3) is the most influential amino acid in determining kinetics of voltage-dependent activation of KvLQT1. A central valine is necessary and sufficient to confer specificity of control of KvLQT1 channel activation by KCNE3. The introduction of mutations spaced one α-helical turn in the amino or carboxyl direction failed to override the phenotype of Val-72, suggesting that its precise positioning is critical for its function. Through detailed analysis, we show that the middle residue (Thr-58) is critical for minK as well, but that surrounding residues within the minK activation triplet functionally contribute to IKs-type activation kinetics. The amino acids in the central position of the activation triplet of minK and KCNE3 are isosteric with only the hydroxyl group of threonine in minK differing from the valine of KCNE3. In summary, we found that a precisely spaced hydroxyl group in the central amino acid produces mink-like kinetics, and larger aliphatic side chains produce KCNE3-like activation. In this study we have focused on the role of a small transmembrane region of KCNEs that specify the control of KvLQT1-gating kinetics. Other investigators have highlighted the functional importance of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail that is the most conserved region among the KCNEs. It is clear that removal of the minK C terminus (22Tapper A.R. George A.L., Jr. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or mutation of key sites within the C terminus (9Sesti F. Goldstein S.A. J. Gen.

These findings raise the interesting question, is the C-terminal portion of minK in fact the region that controls gating of the channel? If this were the case, we would expect that the channel interacts with the KCNE C terminus in two different ways to produce minK or KCNE3-like currents. Our data argue against such a mechanism, because the specificity of minK and KCNE3 actions resides entirely within the transmembrane segments centered on the key single residue (Thr-58 or Val-72). An exchange of the C termini of minK and KCNE3 had no functional consequence (20Melman Y.F. Domenech A. de la Luna S. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6439-6444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The C terminus of minK and KCNE3 are the most highly conserved portions of the molecule, suggesting that its function in the channel complex is also conserved and common between the two. This site of interaction may serve as a crucial point of contact or anchoring that is required for precisely positioning the transmembrane domain to exert its specific effect. The transmembrane domain is postulated to lie in contact with or in close proximity to the KvLQT1 pore or pore-lining helices (22Tapper A.R. George A.L., Jr. J. Gen.

Our finding that some mutants with KCNE3-like behavior can be induced to conduct minK-like currents when preconditioned may be an indication of the mechanism by which KCNE3 converts a voltage-dependent channel into a voltage independent one. After a conditioning hyperpolarized holding potential (−120 mV), these mutant channels open with minK-like kinetics and then become trapped in an apparently constitutive open state until the membrane is hyperpolarized again to −120 mV. Once the conditional constitutively open state is entered, the reentry into a closed state occurs slowly as seen with the bi-exponential deactivation time course. This suggests the presence of two open conducting states, one resulting from voltage-dependent opening that is rapidly reversible and another that can occur through trapping of the channel into a very stable conducting state. KCNE3 may trap a component of the KvLQT1-gating structure in the open state, producing the constitutively active voltage-independent current. T58V minK, T58I minK, and T58C minK appear only to be able to trap partially the channel in this state and only so when the channel assumes the open state driven by the electric field across the membrane during depolarization. These preconditioning effects on gating are reminiscent of the Cole-Moore effect observed in K+ currents of squid axon (28Cole K.S. Moore J.W. Biophys. J. 1960; 1: 161-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) that has also been described for IKS in Xenopus oocytes (29Tzounopoulos T. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2299-2305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The classical Cole-Moore effect is a shift in the onset of channel opening dependent on holding potential but with otherwise normal kinetics and is explained as moving the channel from one of several sequential closed states to another. Thus, more hyperpolarized holding potentials will force the channel into a closed state that requires more conformational changes to reach the open state and delay the onset of activation. Tzounopoulos et al. (29Tzounopoulos T. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2299-2305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) found that minK-IKS exhibited more complex activation changes with holding potential variations that could not be fully explained by a model of sequential, identical, and first-order transitions. Our results with the conditional KCNE3-minK mutants suggest that we are observing an additional discrete open state that is highly stable as well as the altered transition from closed to open states. The precedence for “trapped” states of ion channels exists for Na+ and K+ channels. Voltage-gated Na+ channels are altered by β-scorpion toxins by binding the voltage sensor of the channels while they are in the outward position, thus trapping them in the open state (30Cestele S., Qu, Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Furthermore, prolonged hyperpolarizations could reverse this trapping in a fashion similar to that we have demonstrated with several of our mutations. Additional support comes from Isk produced by minK in Xenopus oocytes that could be altered by the cross-linking agent MTSSP to induce a constitutively active state similar to that seen with KCNE3-like mutants (31Varnum M.D. Maylie J. Busch A. Adelman J.P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 407-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We previously used thermodynamics to help understand the control of kinetics of both opening and closure by minK and KCNE3 chimera mutants (20Melman Y.F. Domenech A. de la Luna S. McDonald T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6439-6444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). That different regions exert control over opening and closing suggests the activation energy for the forward and reverse transitions states is different. This can be envisioned as an altered channel conformation resulting from the different electric field in these two conditions. In such a model, the structure of the transition state is different in the forward and reverse directions and hence could be controlled by different regions of minK. Our observation of bi-exponential kinetics of deactivation for channels with inducible voltage independence suggests that not all open channels are trapped, that non-trapped channels close faster, and the trapped channels close much slower requiring extreme hyperpolarizing forces. Thermodynamically, the trapping of the open state (Otrapped) is equivalent to a large negative change in free energy (ΔGtrapped) relative to the initial open state without necessarily changing the ΔG between closed state and open state (Fig. 6). Thus, the transition back to the closed state will involve a reversal of the trapped interaction and necessarily has a high transition energy requiring supraphysiological differences in the electric field across the membrane. Work from several groups has shed light on the nature of minK regulation of KvLQT1. Cysteines inserted in the transmembrane domain of minK are susceptible to reactivity with cadmium (32Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and methanethiosulfonate (26Wang K.W. Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A.N. Neuron. 1996; 16: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reagents from only one face of the membrane, leading the authors to conclude that the minK transmembrane segment lines the conduction pathway of the KvLQT1/KCNE1 channel. Extensive mutagenesis of minK (23Takumi T. Moriyoshi K. Aramori I. Ishii T. Oiki S. Okada Y. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 2266: 22192-22198Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) showed that the membrane proximal C terminus of minK is least tolerant to changes, suggesting that this segment is critical to the function of the protein. Support for this finding came from biochemical assays showing that the C terminus of minK may interact with the pore region of KvLQT1 (33Romey G. Attali B. Chouabe C. Abitbol I. Guillemare E. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recent work has provided further support to the location of minK in close proximity to the S6 segment of KvLQT1 near cysteine 331 (27Tapper A.R. George A.L., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38249-38254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because precise spacing of the hydroxyl group at position 58 of minK was critical, it is tempting to hypothesize that a specific hydrogen bond occurs at this residue with KvLQT1. By aligning putative transmembrane segments of minK and KvLQT1, it appears that two residues within the channel could provide possible interacting hydrogen bonds with Thr-58 of minK, Tyr-268 in S5, and Ser-339 in S6. As such, the transmembrane domain would be in a position to interact with much of the channel machinery thought to be involved in channel gating including the S5, S6 segments, and the KvLQT1 pore itself. Other possible interpretations are still possible such as Thr-58 facing a water-filled cavity or hydrogen bonding along the carbonyl backbone. Our work characterizes a small region of the KCNEs that is essential for specific modulation of activation kinetics of the KvLQT1 channel. Further investigations into the nature of the interaction of KvLQT1 and this region will allow a further understanding of the control of voltage-gated potassium channels by KCNEs and a better understanding of potassium channel-gating mechanisms. Our work, which localizes one specific role of KCNE control of channel gating to a highly localized region of the protein and investigates the role of various residues at this site, sheds new light on the potential mechanism of the gating of these channels. Furthermore, the identification and characterization of such a region that is so critical to controlling gating kinetics provide a valuable structural reference point for further study of K+ channel gating.

The sensitivity of seven cysteine mutants, including A438C and S440C, to the reagents was significantly reduced by sodium ions, but the opposite was true for A439C. The non-transportable analogue dihydrokainate protected at almost all positions throughout the loop, and at two of the positions, the analogue protected even in the absence of sodium.

The homology is significantly higher in the carboxyl-terminal half of the transporters. Topology studies suggest that this region of the protein has an intriguing arrangement containing two oppositely oriented reentrant loops, the two transmembrane domains (TMs)17 and 8, and an outward-facing hydrophobic region (Refs. 23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several amino acid residues critical for the function of glutamate transporters are located in the carboxyl-terminal half. Two adjacent amino acid residues of GLT-1, Tyr-403 and Glu-404, are located in TM7 (Fig. 1) and are conserved in all other glutamate transporters. Both were implicated in the binding of potassium ions (16Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A conserved arginine residue, Arg-477 in GLT-1, is located in TM8 (Fig. 1) and has been shown to play a pivotal role in the sequential interaction of the transporters with amino acid substrates and with the potassium ion (28Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues engineered into some positions of reentrant loop I are accessible to sulfhydryl reagents from both sides of the membrane (24Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Modification of these cysteines results in inactivation of the transporter, but this can be prevented by l-glutamate applied from the extracellular side (24Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N.

Two serine residues at the carboxyl-terminal extremity of reentrant loop II (Fig. 1) of GLT-1 play a role in the sensitivity of the transporter to the non-transportable glutamate analogue dihydrokainate (29Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mutation of serine 440 to glycine results in an alteration of the sodium specificity of glutamate transport (29Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, when this residue is replaced by cysteine, the S440C transporters become sensitive to membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagents in a substrate- and substrate analogue-protectable fashion (29Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the reentrant loops play an important role in glutamate transport. To address the question of whether reentrant loop II undergoes conformational changes during the transport cycle and participates in the formation of the pore of the transporter, we replaced all residues of this loop, one at a time, by cysteines. We used the functional impact of exposure of these single cysteines to small hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents as an indicator for their accessibility to the aqueous space. It appears that the majority of the engineered cysteines are accessible, indicating that the loop forms part of an aqueous pathway through the transporter. We conclude from the dependence of the accessibility pattern on sodium and dihydrokainate that this loop forms a dynamic structure. Site-directed mutagenesis (30Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

Data are presented after subtracting the values obtained from cells transfected with the vector Bluescript SK(−) alone. Inhibition experiments with MTS reagents (Toronto Research Chemicals, Downsview, Ontario, Canada) were done as described previously (32Zarbiv R. Grunewald M. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14231-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 24-well plates and washed with a medium consisting of 150 mm choline chloride, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mmCaCl2, 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4. The cells were then incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of either the above medium or one containing NaCl instead of choline chloride. Other additions are indicated in the legends to the figures. After 5 min, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of the choline chloride-containing medium followed by the transport assay using 200 μl of NaCl-containing transport medium supplemented with 0.4 μCi of the radiolabeled amino acid for each well. Each experiment was performed at least three times. This was done exactly as described previously (23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To the eluates from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads was added 6-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (18%). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and the biotinylated proteins were detected by using streptavidin-peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For each of the mutants, determination of accessibility to BM was performed at least three times. The cysteine-less GLT-1 with a decahistidine tail at its carboxyl terminus (CL-H) served as the background for introducing cysteine residues at each of positions 422–443 of reentrant loop II (Fig.1). After transient expression of CL-H and the single cysteine mutants in HeLa cells, transport ofd-[3H]aspartate was monitored. The cysteine replacements were generally well tolerated: in 15 of 22 positions the activity ranged between 30–100% of that of the parent construct (Fig.2). Position 431 is accessible to the large sulfhydryl reagent BM but only from the inside of the cells (23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the activity of the A431C mutant was not affected by preincubation with 1 mm membrane-impermeant MTSET (Fig.3). MTSEA is a sulfhydryl reagent smaller than MTSET, and it is also membrane-permeant (34Holmgren M. Liu Y., Xu, Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 35Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol.

In contrast to MTSET, preincubation with 2.5 mm MTSEA potently inhibited the A431C transporters (Fig. 3). Neither of the two reagents had any effect on the cysteine-less transporter (Fig. 3). In the ascending limb of the loop (the stretch from positions 431 to 443) six of the seven single cysteine mutants with significant activity were sensitive to one or both of the MTS reagents (Fig. 3). Only in the case of T432C was no inhibition of d-[3H]aspartate transport by either of these reagents observed. The activity of S443C and the five single cysteine mutants in the consecutive residues 436–440 was inhibited by MTSEA (Fig. 3). The activity of S443C and the mutants of positions 438–440 was also inhibited by the impermeant MTSET (Fig. 3). As will be shown later (Fig. 5), I436C and G437 also became sensitive to MTSET in sodium-free medium.Figure 5The effect of sodium ions on inhibition of single cysteine mutants by MTS reagents. HeLa cells expressing the indicated mutants were washed twice in a 150 mm choline chloride-containing solution and preincubated for 5 min in the presence of the indicated concentrations of MTSEA (A) or MTSET (B) in choline chloride- (white bars) or NaCl-containing (black bars) solutions. The cells were washed twice and assayed for sodium-dependentd-[3H]aspartate uptake for 10 min.

Thus a biotinylated band of the size of the mature plasma membrane form of the transporter (23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was detected in the case of A438C, A439C, and S440C (Fig. 4). This biotinylation could be prevented by reaction of the cells expressing these mutant transporters prior to solubilization and nickel chromatography with MTSET (Fig. 4). Thus, cysteines introduced at position 436 or 437, which are located deeper down in the loop, cannot react with the larger BM (Fig. 4) but only with the smaller MTS reagents. In the descending limb, position 422 was accessible to BM from the extracellular side. However, its modification by MTSEA or MTSET did not have a functional impact (Fig. 3). V425C, T426C, and V427C were partly inhibited by MTSEA, and the former two were also partly inhibited by MTSET. T426C, V427C, and S428C did not react with the large BM (data not shown). No effects of the MTS reagents could be detected with S428C and L429C, whereas in T430C only MTSEA inhibited, just as in A431C (Fig. 3). Serine 440 is a determinant of the sodium specificity of glutamate and aspartate transport, implying that the loop plays a role in the interaction of the transporter with sodium ions (29Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined the effect of sodium ions on the accessibility of the cysteine residues introduced in the pore-loop. The experiments summarized in Fig. 5 illustrate the ability of the MTS reagents to inhibit the transport of the single cysteine mutants upon preincubation with or without sodium ions (choline replacement). To be able to evaluate a possible differential effect at those positions that are very sensitive, namely 436–440 and 443, we probed them with lower concentrations of the reagents than those used in Fig. 3. In the ascending limb, sodium conferred a significant protection against inhibition of I436C, G437C, A438C, and S440C by both reagents (Fig. 5, A and B). On the other hand, sodium potentiated the inhibition of A439C by the two reagents (Fig. 5, A and B). A similar potentiation by sodium was observed on S443C in the case of MTSET (Fig.5 B). The sensitivity of this mutant toward MTSEA was so extreme that total inhibition was obtained using concentrations as low as 5 μm. Therefore we did not continue to try to see whether the effect of sodium is also observed with MTSEA (Fig.5 A). In the descending limb only the inhibition of V427C was protected by sodium, and this was true for both reagents (Fig. 5,A and B). At the apex of the reentrant loop, T430C and A431C were sensitive only to MTSEA (Fig. 3), and in both mutants sodium markedly protected (Fig. 5 A). The activity of these mutants remained insensitive to MTSET also in the absence of sodium (Fig. 5 B). The mutants, whose activity was sensitive to MTSET, were significantly protected against it by the non-transportable glutamate analogue DHK. The only exception was S443C where the analogue potentiated the inhibition by MTSET (Fig.6 B). Similar effects of DHK were observed against inhibition by MTSEA, except for T426C where no effect was observed. In the case of S443C we did not determine the effect due to the extreme sensitivity of this mutant to MTSEA (Fig.6 A). The effects of DHK shown in Fig. 6, A andB, were only observed in the presence of sodium with the exception of mutants V427C and G437C. In the latter two mutants DHK protected against inhibition by both MTS reagents even in the absence of sodium (Fig. 7, choline was used to substitute for sodium during the treatment with the sulfhydryl reagents). Thus, at least in these two positions, DHK can protect without a prior sodium-dependent conformational change. In contrast with the protective effects of DHK, the transportable substrate d-aspartate did not protect against inhibition by both reagents, except for positions 438 and 440. This is shown in Fig.6 B for MTSET, but similar results were also observed with MTSEA (data not shown). d-Aspartate did not protect against the inhibition of transport activity by MTSET in T426C, A439C, and S443C (Fig. 6 B), and the same was true for the other sensitive mutants regardless of whether MTSET or MTSEA was used (data not shown).Figure 7Effect of DHK on inhibition of V427C and G437C by MTS reagents in the absence of sodium. HeLa cells expressing the mutants were washed and incubated with the indicated concentrations of MTS reagents in choline chloride-containing solution in the presence (white bars) or absence of 1 mmDHK (black bars). The cells were washed twice and assayed for sodium-dependentd-[3H]aspartate uptake for 10 min. Data shown are percentage of transport relative to transport in the absence of MTS reagents. Each bar is the mean ± S.E. of three to seven independent determinations, each done in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further analysis of the effect of transportable substrates on the protection of A438C and S440C against inhibition by MTSET revealed an intriguing result. Although d- and l-aspartate both protected, a saturating concentration of l-glutamate (1 mm) did not protect A438C and only had a slight protective effect on S440C (Fig.8 A). The specificity of the protection by d- and l-aspartate was shown using γ-aminobutyric acid. This amino acid neurotransmitter, which does not interact with GLT-1, also does not protect (Fig.8 A). The lack of a protective effect byl-glutamate does not reflect the binding to a different site than that of aspartate because l-glutamate prevented the protection afforded by aspartate when both were present (Fig. 8 B). The great majority of the cysteines engineered in reentrant loop II are accessible to the aqueous phase as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of small hydrophilic sulfhydryl reagents on the transport of these mutants (summarized in Fig. 9). 15 of 22 mutants retained greater than 30% of the activity of the parent construct (Fig. 2), and 11 of these 15 were inhibited by MTSEA (Fig.3). It is possible that in the four mutants where no significant effect of MTSEA was observed, the introduced cysteines are still accessible to the hydrophilic reagents, but their modification has no functional impact. This is the case for at least one of these four, namely G422C. The activity of this single cysteine mutant was neither affected by MTSEA nor by MTSET (Fig. 3). However, this cysteine is labeled by the large BM, and this labeling is prevented by preincubation with MTSET (23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although BM has a definite membrane permeability, it reacts only with cysteines exposed to the aqueous phase. Our results showed that the reentrant loop is accessible to the aqueous phase at many positions and therefore behaves like a pore-loop rather than two membrane-embedded segments. Our accessibility data are in good agreement with those reported in the study by Seal et al.(26Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) where accessibility to MTSET of seven of the corresponding single cysteine mutants of the related glutamate transporter EAAT-1 has been examined. In their study single cysteine transporters were labeled by biotin-MTSEA. The cysteines at positions corresponding to 426, 430, 436, 437, 438, 439, and 440 are labeled by this reagent, and reduction of this labeling by MTSET was obtained in all positions except for 430. Although Seal et al. (26Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Neuron. 2000; 25: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) do not draw this conclusion, the latter observation is consistent with the assignment of position 430 together with 431 at the apex of the reentrant loop, facing the intracellular side (Ref. 23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, and Figs. 3 and 5). In the presence of sodium, five of the 11 single cysteine mutants were sensitive to MTSEA but relatively resistant to MTSET: V427C, T430C, A431C, I436C, and G437C (Fig. 3). Since MTSET is membrane-impermeant (34Holmgren M. Liu Y., Xu, Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 35Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and also larger than MTSEA, this difference in sensitivity could be due to internal versus external exposure of the engineered cysteine. Alternatively the smaller MTSEA may reach positions with a restricted access, and the larger MTSET cannot access those. The results of our accessibility studies are in good agreement with the membrane topology we determined for GLT-1 (Refs. 23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and 25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, and see Fig. 1). Thus, going down the ascending limb, which connects the external S443C with the internal A431C (Fig. 1), we found that cysteines introduced at positions 440, 439, and 438 are accessible to the small reagents MTSEA and MTSET (Fig. 3) and also the large BM (Fig.4). The cysteines introduced at positions 437 and 436 of the pore-loop did not react with BM (Fig. 4). They were not very accessible to MTSET in the presence of sodium but became markedly more accessible to MTSET in its absence (Figs. 3 and 5). Both were accessible to the smaller MTSEA even in the presence of sodium (Fig. 3). Accessibility of five consecutive positions rules out a membrane-embedded α-helix facing an aqueous pore but is compatible with pore helices such as those observed in the potassium channel KcsA (36Doyle D.A. Morais-Cabral J.H. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar) and the water and glycerol channels (37Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heyman J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 38Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J.W. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). In the descending limb, which connects the external G422 with the internal A431, the cysteines introduced at positions 425, 426, and 427 were accessible to MTSEA, and the two at 425 and 426 were also somewhat accessible to MTSET (Fig. 3). The residues at the apex of the loop, which face the inside of the cell (Thr-430 and Ala-431), were only accessible to the permeant MTSEA but not to MTSET (Fig.3). Reentrant loop I in the related bacterial glutamate transporter gltT contains three consecutive residues accessible from both sides of the membrane (24Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 14282-14287Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Using BM we have shown that one of these corresponding residues in GLT-1 is also accessible to both sides of the membrane (25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). BM labels both the mature plasma membrane form and the immature internal form (25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The latter has a larger mobility on SDS-PAGE (23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but only the labeling of the former is prevented by MTSET (25Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We have not observed any of the cysteines introduced in reentrant loop II to be accessible to BM from both sides of the membrane. Only the internal form of A431C is labeled by BM (23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), whereas the external form only is labeled by the maleimide in the case of G442C and S443C (23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and this was also true for A438C, A439C, and S440C (Fig. 4). T426C, V427C, and S428C were not labeled by BM (data not shown). It appears that the descending limb is less accessible from the extracellular space than the ascending limb. It is noteworthy that residue 427 is located in close proximity to residue 412 (39Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The latter is located at the extracellular side of transmembrane domain 7 (Ref. 23Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, and see Fig. 1). Thus a possible explanation for the limited accessibility of the descending limb is its proximity with part of TM7. Pore-loops have been observed in the bacterial potassium channel KcsA (36Doyle D.A. Morais-Cabral J.H. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar) and also in glycerol and water channels (37Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heyman J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 38Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J.W. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). In the latter two, the two loops have an opposite orientation, just like those in the glutamate transporters. In the channels the pore-loops are a key element in permeation, and the relatively rigid structures serve as selectivity filters (36Doyle D.A. Morais-Cabral J.H. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5649) Google Scholar, 37Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heyman J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y.

Residue serine 440 of reentrant loop II is also a determinant of sodium selectivity and is close to the glutamate binding site (29Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast to the pore loops of KcsA and the aquaporins, reentrant loop II appears not to be fixed but to undergo conformational changes dependent on the presence of sodium (Fig. 9, upper panel). In many of the residues throughout the loop the accessibility to MTS reagents was reduced by sodium (Fig.5). It is highly unlikely that sodium is physically blocking the access of the MTS reagents to all these residues. Moreover, in the case of positions 439 and 443, sodium potentiates the accessibility, and this must be due to a conformational change induced by sodium binding. It is likely that this difference between the pore-loop of the glutamate transporter and those of the channels is related to differences in the permeation through channels and transporters. The observations on the effects of aspartate and DHK on accessibility of residues of the pore-loop (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8) are consistent with the proximity of serine 440 to the substrate binding site (29Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The accessibility of many of the cysteines introduced in the loop was limited by DHK (Fig. 6). Although in most cases the protection by DHK required the presence of sodium, in the two positions 427 and 437 this was not the case (Figs. 7 and 9). Therefore, binding of DHK in such a manner to protect at these positions does not require any sodium-induced conformational changes. The sodium dependence of protection by DHK of the other residues is probably due to the sodium-dependent conformational changes of the loop described above. Following these changes, DHK may sterically protect a larger part of the loop. d-Aspartate protected only at the two positions 438 and 440 but interestingly not at position 439, although DHK did protect at the latter position (Fig. 6). DHK is a bulkier molecule than d-aspartate, and it appears that this extra mass physically restricts access to the residues of the pore-loop from the outside. This is perhaps also the reason why DHK could protect T426C against MTSET but not against MTSEA (Fig. 5). An easy explanation is that permeant MTSEA can approach the cysteine introduced at position 426 from the inside, whereas in the case of the impermeant MTSET the approach has to be from the outside. The observation thatd- and l-aspartate protect much better thanl-glutamate at position 440 and even more dramatically at position 438 (Fig. 8) seems counterintuitive because of the larger mass of l-glutamate. However, it has been demonstrated that the distance between the oxygens of the two carboxyl groups of aspartate is in fact larger than that of glutamate (41Young V.R. Ajami A.M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 829S-900SCrossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although it appears that DHK can protect at some positions without the involvement of conformational changes, its binding is likely to induce the movement of other residues. This is exemplified by the potentiation by DHK of the inhibition of S443C by MTSET (Fig. 6 B). A conserved arginine located in the middle of TM8 appears to be an important binding determinant for one of the carboxyl groups of the substrate (28Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, the access to TM8 appears to be much more restricted than that of the pore-loop (42Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A particularly intriguing question is how, after binding in the vicinity of the pore-loop, the accessibility of glutamate to TM8 is achieved. One way to shed light on this question may be to examine proximity relationships (39Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) of pairs of cysteines introduced in the pore-loop and TM8 in the presence and absence of glutamate. We thank Beryl Levene for expert secretarial assistance and Nir Avraham for preparing some of the single cysteine mutants."

To identify intracellular mechanisms associated with the appearance of ubiquitin-protein aggregates, mouse neuronal HT4 cells were treated with cadmium. This heavy metal is a potent cell poison that mediates oxidative stress and disrupts the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. In the current studies, the following intracellular events were found to be also induced by cadmium: (i) a specific rise in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression but not COX-1; (ii) an increase in the extracellular levels of the proinflammatory prostaglandin E2, a product of COX-2; and (iii) production of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-protein adducts, which result from lipid peroxidation. In addition, cadmium treatment led to the accumulation of high molecular weight ubiquitin-COX-2 conjugates and perturbed COX-2 glycosylation. The thiol-reducing antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, and, to a lesser extent, the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, attenuated the loss of cell viability induced by cadmium demonstrating that oxidative stress and COX-2 activation contribute to cadmium cytotoxicity. These findings establish that disruption of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is not the only event triggered by cadmium. This oxidative stressor also activates COX-2 function. Both events could be triggered by formation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal as a result of cadmium-induced lipid peroxidation.

In many neurodegenerative disorders, however, aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins are detected in neuronal inclusions (for review, see Ref. 2Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Rockwell P. Banik N.L. Lajtha A. Smith M. Proteolysis in the Pathophysiology of Neurodegenerative Disease. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2001: 137-153Google Scholar). A correlation between neuronal inclusions and cell death remains to be established (3Sisodia S.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 4Andersen J.K. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 118: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, recent findings demonstrated that protein aggregates directly impair the function of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, known to be essential for cell survival (5Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). It has become increasingly evident that functional changes in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway are critical to the neurodegenerative process. For example, a mutant form of ubiquitin (Ub),1 known as Ub+1, was detected only in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and not in age-matched controls (6van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A. Sluijs J.A. Koycu S. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Peter J. Burbach H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Ub+1-capped polyubiquitin chains were shown to be refractory to disassembly by de-ubiquitinating enzymes and to inhibit proteasome degradation of a polyubiquitinated substrate potently (7Lam Y.A. Pickart C.M. Alban A. Landon M. Jamieson C. Ramage R. Mayer R.J. Layfield R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9902-9906Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Moreover, particular areas of AD brains were found to exhibit compromised proteasome activities compared with age-matched controls (8Keller J.N. Hanni K.B. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In addition, a decline in ubiquitination activity was shown to decrease cell viability in a cellular model of Huntington's disease (9Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). In this model, transfected rat striatal neurons coexpressing a nonfunctional ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and a mutant huntingtin containing polyglutamine expansions showed a greater loss of cell viability than transfectants expressing the huntingtin mutant alone (9Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Together, these results strongly support the view that disruption of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway plays an important role in neurodegeneration. Oxidative stress is another mechanism found to be involved in neurodegeneration. Increasing evidence supports its role in neuronal death in disorders such as AD and Parkinson's disease. Studies with autopsied brains of AD patients show a colocalization of high levels of oxidative stress products with neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques (10Markesbery W.R. Carney J.M. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Furthermore, signs of oxidative stress, such as lipid peroxidation and a decline in reduced glutathione (GSH), were detected in the substantia nigra in brains of Parkinson's disease patients (11Fahn S. Cohen G. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). The production of free radicals by oxidative stress promotes partial unfolding of cellular proteins, resulting in exposure of previously buried hydrophobic domains to proteolytic enzymes (12Grune T.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4086-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This sudden increase in protein substrates may compromise the capacity of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway to clear the abnormal proteins and cause their aggregation and accumulation within the cell. However, the link between oxidative stress and the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in neurodegeneration remains to be established. To address the relationship between oxidative stress and disruption of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in the neurodegenerative process, we chose to treat mouse neuronal HT4 cells with cadmium (Cd2+). This heavy metal increases lipid peroxidation in organs such as the brain, which is particularly sensitive to Cd2+ toxicity (16Acan N.L. Tezcan E.F. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 54: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although Cd2+ is not a Fenton metal and thus, by itself, is unable to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), free radical scavengers and antioxidants lessen Cd2+ toxicity, suggesting that the heavy metal elicits an increase in free radical production (for review, see Ref. 17Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). Earlier studies (18Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Schobert C. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 361: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggested a close link between Cd2+cytotoxicity and the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway because yeast mutants deficient in a specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC7) or a proteasome subunit (PRE1) were shown to be hypersensitive to the heavy metal. Moreover, our previous studies with neuronal cells (19Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Yakushin S. Cohen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 20Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Cohen G. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 65-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that Cd2+ disrupts intracellular sulfhydryl homeostasis, leading to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and to a loss in cell viability. The ubiquitinated proteins that accumulate in cells upon Cd2+ treatment and the mechanisms mediating its toxicity in neuronal cells remain poorly defined. Herein we report that, in mouse neuronal HT4 cells, Cd2+initiated a proinflammatory response by inducing up-regulation of COX-2 at the mRNA and protein levels without affecting COX-1. As a result of this response, there was an increase in the extracellular concentrations of the proinflammatory prostaglandin PGE2, which is a COX-2 product. Moreover, treatments with the heavy metal resulted in the stabilization of glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of COX-2 as well as an accumulation of ubiquitin-COX-2 conjugates. Cd2+also induced the formation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)-protein adducts in the neuronal cells, indicating that its cytotoxicity may be mediated by HNE, a highly cytotoxic aldehyde product of lipid peroxidation. Based on the observations that Cd2+-induced oxidative stress is closely associated with COX-2 up-regulation and neuronal cell death, we evaluated the protective effect of two antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and ascorbic acid) and a COX-2-specific inhibitor (celecoxib) on Cd2+ cytotoxicity. Of the three drugs tested, NAC, a thiol-reducing antioxidant, was the most effective in preventing the loss of cell viability caused by the heavy metal. Ascorbic acid, a free radical scavenger, failed to prevent and even potentiated Cd2+ cytotoxicity in some instances. Celecoxib, the COX-2-specific inhibitor, attenuated the loss of cell viability caused by the heavy metal under certain conditions. These studies provide evidence that both the disruption of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and the induction of a proinflammatory response are induced by oxidative stressors such as cadmium. These two mechanisms may be associated in the neurodegenerative process. Cadmium sulfate, NAC, ascorbic acid, actinomycin D, puromycin, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide were from Sigma. Tunicamycin was from Calbiochem. Celecoxib was a generous gift from Pharmacia Corp. (Peapack, NJ). The goat polyclonal antibodies anti-COX-2 (1:1,000) and anti-COX-1 (1:1,000) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Ubiquitin-protein conjugates were detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1,500) from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). HNE-protein adducts were identified with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1,000) from Calbiochem. The Super Signal West Pico detection system and the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit were from Pierce Chemical Co. Other reagents were of the highest purity available. HT4 cells were derived from a mouse neuroblastoma cell line infected with a retrovirus encoding the temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 large T antigen. When grown at 39 °C (nonpermissive temperature), HT4 cells differentiate with neuronal morphology, express neuronal antigens, synthesize and secrete nerve growth factor, and express receptors for nerve growth factor (21Whittemore S.R. Holets V.R. Keane R.W. Levy D.J. McKay R.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 156-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained at 33 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, as described previously (19Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Yakushin S. Cohen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Cultures of HT4 cells were treated at 37 °C with aqueous solutions of cadmium sulfate added to serum-containing medium. When specified, antioxidants (1 mmNAC or 1 mm ascorbic acid) or the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (20 μm) or inhibitors of transcription (15 μg/ml actinomycin D) or translation (25 μg/ml puromycin) or an inhibitor ofN-linked glycosylation (10 μg/ml tunicamycin), was added to the culture medium 1 h before Cd2+ treatment. NAC, ascorbic acid, and puromycin were dissolved in water, and the remaining listed drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. At the end of the indicated incubation times, the cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were harvested as described previously (22Rockwell P. Yuan H. Magnusson R. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cell washes removed unattached cells; hence, subsequent assays were performed on adherent cells only. Cell extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described previously (19Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Yakushin S. Cohen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Identification of COX-1, COX-2, ubiquitinated proteins, and HNE-protein adducts was by Western blotting on 8% polyacrylamide gels. For detection of HNE-protein adducts the samples were run under nonreducing conditions in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. The antigens were visualized by a horseradish peroxidase method utilizing the Super Signal West Pico detection system. Quantitative analysis of the immunostaining was by image analysis with the ImagePC program from NIH as described previously (23Pereira M.E., Yu, B. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated with the RNAeasy Kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). To perform each reverse transcription-PCR, 1 μg of RNA/sample was reverse transcribed in a 25-μl reaction (Omniscript reverse transcription kit from Qiagen), and 2 μl of the resultant cDNA was amplified with gene-specific primers using the TaqPCR core kit from Qiagen. The mouse-specific PCR primers for cox-2 were CAGCACTTCACCCATCAGTT (forward) and CTGGTCAATGGAGGCCTTTG (reverse), and for ubA they were CAACATCCAGAAAGAGTCCA (forward) and CCTCATCTTGTCACAGTTGT (reverse). Primers were designed from cDNA sequences obtained from GenBank under the accession numbers M88242 for mouse cox-2 and M11690 for mouse ubA. PCR was performed for 5 min at 94 °C, then 35 cycles for ubA and 30 cycles for cox-2 of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Levels of PGE2 released into the medium of treated cells were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). For all experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml. Amounts of PGE2 are expressed as ng of PGE2 produced/ml of medium. Immunoprecipitation of COX-2 from total cell extracts, normalized to protein concentration, was performed as described previously (24Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Efthimiopoulos S. Tezapsidis N. Buku A. Ghiso J. Mehta P. Robakis N.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1417-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes were resolved on 8% SDS gels followed by Western blot analysis probed with the anti-COX-2 antibody and stripping and reprobing with the anti-ubiquitin conjugate antibody. Cell viability was assessed with a modification of the method described by Mosmann (25Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46513) Google Scholar) by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously (19Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Yakushin S. Cohen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Total GSH was quantified as described previously (26Mytilineou C. Han S.K. Cohen G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1470-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) by a modification of the standard recycling assay based on the reduction of 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) with glutathione reductase and NADPH. This assay measures both GSH and GSSG; normally GSSG measures less than 5% of the total GSH in control cell cultures. Protein levels were determined with a bicinchoninic acid assay kit. Statistical comparisons between two groups (see Fig. 6) or among three or more groups (see Fig. 8) were performed with the unpaired t test or with the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test (Instat 2.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego), respectively.Figure 8NAC and ascorbic acid effects on HT4 cells treated with cadmium. The effect of NAC or ascorbic acid (Asc.) was assessed on the levels of COX-2 (A), glutathione (B), and PGE2 (C and D) in HT4 cells treated with increasing concentrations of Cd2+. Cells were incubated with 1 mm NAC or 1 mmascorbic acid 1 h before a 24-h treatment with Cd2+when assayed for COX-2 (A) and GSH levels (B) or a 7-h treatment with Cd2+ for PGE2 levels (C andD). After the indicated treatments, the cells were harvested and prepared for COX-2 immunoblotting (A) or measurements of GSH (B). PGE2 levels in the medium (C andD) were carried out as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The plot on the bottom ofA represents the semiquantification, by densitometry, of the changes in COX-2 levels in HT4 cells treated with Cd2+ only (●) or Cd2+ in combination with NAC (■) or ascorbic acid (○). The values (y axis) are displayed as -fold increases in COX-2 levels compared with no cadmium treatment, which was given an arbitrary value of 1. The blots shown are representative of one of at least two identical experiments for each condition tested. B, C, and Drepresent the mean ± S.E. of at least three determinations. ■, cadmium only; ▪, NAC and Cd2+; ▤, ascorbic acid and Cd2+. The asterisk (*) in Bidentifies the values that are significantly different (at leastp < 0.05) from the respective controls treated without cadmium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the time and concentration dependence of the effect of Cd 2+ on the intracellular levels of COX-2, we treated confluent HT4 cells with a range of concentrations between 1.5 and 45 μmCdSO4. After incubations of 10–48 h, intracellular levels of COX-2 in total lysates prepared from adherent cells were visualized by Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 shows the dose-dependent course of the changes in COX-2 levels after treatment for 10, 16, 24, and 48 h with CdSO4. Anti-COX-2 immunoreactivity detected a light 72 kDa band in control cells or cells treated with 1.5 μm CdSO4. This band corresponds to COX-2 that is N-glycosylated at three sites (27Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cells treated with higher Cd2+concentrations, such as 3, 15, 30 and, in some cases, 45 μm, two additional bands were identified as corresponding to COX-2 forms that are N-glycosylated at four sites (74 kDa) and nonglycosylated (65 kDa), respectively (27Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three COX-2 bands, corresponding to 74, 72, as well as 65 kDa, are clearly visible in Fig. 5 (see below). COX-2 levels rose above control as early as 10 h after treatment with 15 μm CdSO4, which is the Cd2+ concentration that most effectively increases COX-2 levels to a range between 3- and 38-fold above control (Fig. 1 E). In addition, a form of COX-2 (Ub-COX-2) which migrated at a high molecular weight was clearly identified at the top of blots corresponding to cells treated for 24 and 48 h with 15 μm Cd2+ (Fig. 1, C andD). At higher Cd2+ concentrations (45 μm) the levels of all COX-2 forms decrease. This effect is most likely the result of a dramatic loss in cell viability caused by high Cd2+ concentrations (see below).Figure 5Cadmium perturbs COX-2 glycosylation.Electrophoretic mobilities of native (A) and unglycosylated (B) COX-2 forms from HT4 cell lysates (20 μg of protein/lane) incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with the Cd2+ concentrations listed in the figure are shown. Unglycosylated COX-2 was obtained by treating the cells with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin (Tun.) 1 h before the addition of cadmium. The blots shown are representative of one of at least two identical experiments for each condition tested. Molecular mass markers in kDa are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The increase in COX-2 protein levels observed in HT4 cells upon treatment with the heavy metal could result from either a reduction in COX-2 degradation or an increase in its expression. To establish whether cadmium affectscox-2 gene expression we carried out reverse transcription-PCR analyses with gene-specific primers. These studies revealed that CdSO4 concentrations ranging between 3 and 30 μm caused a considerable induction of cox-2mRNA (Fig. 2 A). TheubA mRNA levels did not change significantly with these treatments. The levels of cox-2 and ubA mRNA were both decreased by 45 μm CdSO4, most likely because of the high level of cell death elicited by this concentration of the heavy metal. Pretreatment of HT4 cells with inhibitors of transcription (actinomycin D) or translation (puromycin) prevented the Cd2+-induced rise in COX-2 protein levels (compare Fig. 2 B, top panel, with Fig. 2 C). Only the preexisting 72-kDa form of COX-2 was identified in cells pretreated with actinomycin D or puromycin. This finding demonstrates that the other COX-2 forms detected in cells treated solely with Cd2+, namely the 74- and 65-kDa forms as well as ubiquitinated-COX-2, are dependent onde novo protein synthesis. The increase in cyclooxygenase levels induced by Cd2+ is specific for COX-2. Protein levels of COX-1, which is constitutive in HT4 cells, were not raised by treatment with increasing concentrations of the heavy metal (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). To evaluate the functional changes in COX-2 levels shown in Fig. 1, culture medium from HT4 cells incubated with different Cd2+ concentrations over time were analyzed for production of the proinflammatory prostaglandin PGE2, a COX-2 product (Fig. 3). In the absence of cadmium, HT4 cells maintained a basal level of ∼0.25 ng of PGE2/ml of medium. After 24-h incubations with increasing concentrations of cadmium, PGE2 levels were elevated to a maximum of 90 ng of PGE2/ml of medium, a 360-fold increase over basal levels. After 48 h of treatment, PGE2 production in cells treated with 30 and 45 μm Cd2+ was at least 3-fold lower than in those treated with 15 μm heavy metal. This decline in PGE2 production most likely reflects the poor cell survival caused by higher Cd2+ concentrations. The COX-2 immunoreactive high molecular mass forms detected by Western blot analysis of total cell lysates probed with anti-COX-2 were characterized further for the presence of ubiquitin. Total lysates prepared from control and Cd2+-treated HT4 cells were subjected to imunoprecipitation with the anti-COX-2 antibody. Western blots of the immunoprecipitated proteins probed with the anti-COX-2 antibody (Fig. 4 B) revealed three COX-2 forms (74/72-kDa doublet and 65 kDa) as well as high molecular mass COX-2 (Ub-COX-2), a pattern of reactivity similar to the one observed in Fig. 1. Only the high molecular mass COX-2 forms were detected when these blots were stripped and reprobed with the antibody that recognizes ubiquitin conjugates (Fig. 4 A). These findings suggest that Cd2+ promotes stabilization of COX-2 as high molecular mass ubiquitin conjugates. Treatment with endoglycosidase H reduced the apparent molecular mass of most of the 72/74-kDa doublet to the 65 kDa band (data not shown). The latter was also the major band identified in Cd2+-treated cells preincubated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin, a glycosylation inhibitor (Fig.5 B). The 65 kDa band corresponds, therefore, to unglycosylated COX-2. These results indicate that the shift in COX-2 apparent molecular masses seen in Cd2+-treated cells is the result of changes in the extent of its glycosylation and not its proteolytic degradation. To investigate which mechanisms mediate Cd2+ cytotoxicity we evaluated the effects of two antioxidants, NAC and ascorbic acid, and a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, on HT4 cell viability. The results obtained after treatments with 15, 30, and 45 μm heavy metal for 7 or 24 h are shown in Fig. 6, A and B, respectively. The lowest survival rate was observed as an approximate 90% decrease in cell viability after a 24-h treatment with 45 μm Cd2+. A 7-h treatment with the same Cd2+ concentration caused a 45% reduction in cell viability. The thiol-reducing agent NAC significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated the loss in cell viability caused by 7-h (Fig.6 Aa) or 24-h (Fig. 6 Ba) treatment with the three Cd2+ concentrations tested. Moreover, celecoxib, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, significantly (p < 0.05) lessened the cytotoxic effect of 7-h incubations with the same three Cd2+ concentrations (Fig. 6 Ab). The COX-2 inhibitor was less effective after 24-h incubations with the heavy metal by only significantly (p < 0.05) preventing the loss of viability of cells treated with 15 μmCd2+ (Fig. 6 Bb). These findings suggest that the induction of a proinflammatory response is one of the early mechanisms activated by Cd2+ and plays an important role in its cytotoxicity. However, in longer exposures to the heavy metal, other cytotoxic mechanisms may be activated sufficiently to override the effect of the proinflammatory response alone. COX-2 activity may then contribute to the acceleration of the cytotoxic process. Remarkably, ascorbic acid failed to prevent the loss of cell viability caused by Cd2+ treatment. In some instances, this free radical scavenger even intensified Cd2+ cytotoxicity (Fig.6 Bc). As discussed below, this effect could be the result of a synergism between the antioxidant and cadmium in causing lipid peroxidation (see “Discussion”). Inhibitors of transcription (actinomycin D) or translation (puromycin) did not significantly alter the loss of cell viability caused by 24-h treatments with Cd2+ (Fig. 6 B, d ande, respectively). These results suggest that under these conditions, de novo protein synthesis of COX-2 is not the sole contributor to the cytotoxic process. It should be noted that some of the drugs tested in these experiments, namely celecoxib, actinomycin D, and puromycin, were slightly cytotoxic. Their effect on Cd2+-mediated loss in cell viability, therefore, reflects a comparison with cells treated with the drugs alone. One of the effects of Cd2+-induced oxidative stress is lipid peroxidation. Because HNE is a product of lipid peroxidation, we investigated whether the heavy metal causes the formation of this highly cytotoxic aldehyde. Fig.7 shows that 15, 30, and 45 μm Cd2+ induce the formation of HNE-protein adducts. These protein conjugates, with molecular masses above 132 kDa, are indicated at the top of the Western blot shown in Fig.7. Because HNE is known to be an extremely reactive electrophile, it is possible that the cytotoxic effect of Cd2+ is potentiated by this aldehyde. The Cd2+-induced HNE-protein adducts were not detected in HT4 cells pretreated with NAC (Fig. 7, right lanes). The latter is a sulfur-containing antioxidant, which reacts directly with free radicals and may therefore prevent lipid peroxidation. To test further the hypothesis that oxidation of protein thiols and ROS production are events that mediate Cd2+ toxicity we attempted to block some of the heavy metal effects with the thiol-reducing agent NAC. As seen in Fig.8, 1 mm NAC prevented the Cd2+"

Such protein effector molecules then act directly to mediate the cellular functions of hGH. We report here that autocrine hGH production by mammary carcinoma cells specifically results in the transcriptional repression of the p53-regulated placental transforming growth factor-β (PTGF-β) gene. Transcriptional repression of the PTGF-β gene does not require the p53-binding sites in the PTGF-β promoter, and autocrine hGH also desensitized the response of thePTGF-β promoter to p53 overexpression. Transcriptional repression of the PTGF-β gene is accompanied by consequent decreases in its protein product, Smad-mediated transcription, and its cellular effects that include cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. PTGF-β specifically inhibited the autocrine hGH-stimulated expression of cyclin D1 required for autocrine hGH-stimulated mammary carcinoma cell cycle progression. Thus, one mechanism by which autocrine hGH promotes an increase in mammary carcinoma cell number is by transcriptional repression of protein effector molecules that promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Garcia-Caballero, L. Frappart, G. Morel, and H. C. Mertani, submitted for publication. Increased epithelial expression of the hGH gene is associated with the acquisition of pathological proliferation, and the highest level of hGH gene expression is observed in metastatic mammary carcinoma cells.2 hGH receptor gene expression per mammary epithelial cell remains constant throughout the process of neoplastic progression (1Mertani H.C. Garcia-Caballero T. Lambert A. Gerard F. Palayer C. Boutin J.M. Vonderhaar B.K. Waters M.J. Lobie P.E. Morel G. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 79: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and therefore changes in the local concentration of ligand are likely to be pivotal to determine the effects of hGH on the behavior of the mammary epithelial cell. We have recently generated a model system to study the role of autocrine-produced hGH in mammary carcinoma by stable transfection of either the hGH gene or a translation-deficient hGH gene into mammary carcinoma (MCF-7) cells (2Kaulsay K.K. Mertani H.C. Tornell J. Morel G. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells results in a hyperproliferative state with marked synergism observed between trophic agents such as IGF-1 (2Kaulsay K.K. Mertani H.C. Tornell J. Morel G. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The increase in mammary carcinoma cell number as a consequence of autocrine production of hGH is a result of both increased mitogenesis and decreased apoptosis (3Kaulsay K.K. Zhu T. Bennett W. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Autocrine hGH production also results in enhancement of the rate of mammary carcinoma cell spreading on a collagen substrate (4Kaulsay K.K. Mertani H.C. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may affect cell motility and dissemination of the carcinoma. All of the studied effects of autocrine hGH on mammary carcinoma cell behavior are mediated via the hGH receptor (3Kaulsay K.K. Zhu T. Bennett W. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells may direct mammary carcinoma cell behavior to impact on the final clinical prognosis. Systematic analysis of the relevant mechanistic features by which autocrine hGH exerts its cellular effects is therefore required.One major mechanism by which GH affects cellular and somatic function is by regulating the level of specific mRNA species (5Isaksson O.G. Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these GH-regulated genes code for trophic factors such as IGF-1 (6Klapper D.G. Svoboda M.E. Van Wyk J.J. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 2215-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which act in an intermediary role to execute the cellular effects of GH. Indeed, GH has been demonstrated to regulate the level of a number of trophic factors in specific tissues including hepatocyte growth factor in liver (7Ekberg S. Luther M. Nakamura T. Jansson J.O. J.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3940-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that many of the effects of autocrine hGH on mammary carcinoma cell function are also mediated by genetic regulation of specific trophic factors. Here we have used a cDNA microarray to identify autocrine hGH-regulated genes encoding polypeptide effector molecules that will act in an intermediary manner to mediate the effects of hGH on mammary carcinoma cell function.We observed that autocrine hGH decreased transcription of thePTGF-β gene with consequent decreases in its protein product and accompanying cellular effects, which include cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. PTGF-β specifically inhibited the autocrine hGH-stimulated expression of cyclin D1 to prevent mammary carcinoma cell cycle progression. Thus, one mechanism by which autocrine hGH promotes mammary carcinoma cell survival is by transcriptional repression of protein effector molecules that promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Such a mechanism is analogous and complementary to the ability of hGH to transcriptionally activate protein effector molecules, such as IGF-1, which stimulate processes resulting in increased cell number (15Le Roith D. Bondy C. Yakar S. Liu J.L. Butler A. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 53-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated here that autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells results in a specific decrease ofPTGF-β gene transcription. Thus, autocrine hGH function in the mammary epithelial cell, such as mitogenesis and cell survival, may be partly mediated by, or first require, repression of the inhibitory effects of PTGF-β. Furthermore, because PTGF-β is a secreted protein, it will also act in a paracrine fashion to affect the function of neighboring cells. In carcinoma of the mammary gland, such paracrine interactions usually occur between carcinoma cells of epithelial origin and neighboring stromal fibroblasts and are pivotal to the development of carcinoma (36Elenbaas B. Weinberg R.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy to mention that the hGH receptor is predominantly expressed on the normal or neoplastic epithelial cells of the human mammary gland, and therefore autocrine hGH production by mammary epithelial cells will, via the paracrine action of PTGF-β, affect stromal cell function. For example, fibroadenoma of the mammary gland, where we observe increased expression of the hGH gene in epithelial cells,2 exhibits an intense stromal reaction. It is possible that loss of paracrine PTGF-β secretion by the mammary epithelial cell in response to autocrine hGH production may contribute to changes in stromal architecture. TGF-β secreted by mammary carcinoma cells has been demonstrated to affect stromal architecture and tumor progression (36Elenbaas B. Weinberg R.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Use of in vivo models will allow us to define the effect of autocrine production of hGH by mammary epithelial or mammary carcinoma cells on the surrounding stroma and delineate the relative contribution to neoplastic progression.PTGF-β is a recently identified secretory protein that shares ∼25% sequence identity with TGF-β family members (23Lawton L.N. Bonaldo M.F. Jelenc P.C. Qiu L. Baumes S.A. Marcelino R.A. de Jesus G.M. Wellington S. Knowles J.A. Warburton D. Brown S. Soares M.B. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and possesses several characteristics of the TGF-β superfamily including a signal peptide, a consensus RXXR(A/S) cleavage signal for processing to the mature form, and seven conserved cysteine residues in the carboxyl terminus (mature form) (22Bootcov M.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13760-13767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). PTGF-β has also been demonstrated to utilize either the type I TGF-β receptor or type II TGF-β receptor to mediate cell cycle arrest (16Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Activation of type I TGF-β receptor or type II TGF-β receptor results in a complex series of downstream signaling events resulting in phosphorylation of Smad proteins that translocate to the nucleus, associate with transcriptional co-activators, and transactivate TGF-β-regulated genes (40Liu X.P. Tsushimi K. Tsushimi M. Kawauchi S. Oga A. Furuya T. Sasaki K. Cancer Lett. 2001; 170: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also observed here that autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells results in decreased Smad-mediated gene transcription in accord with the decreased production of PTGF-β. Other mechanisms may also exist for the observed autocrine hGH-stimulated decrease in Smad-mediated transcription. By use of cDNA microarray technology we have reported recently (24Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lee K.O. Morel G. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21464-21475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that the ski oncogene is ∼4-fold up-regulated in response to autocrine production of hGH. It has been demonstrated recently that ski associates with both Smad2 and Smad3 resulting in repression of TGF-β-responsive promoters via the Smad-binding element (SBE) used here (41Fawcett T.W., Xu, Q. Holbrook N.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1997; 2: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The TGF-β pathway usually functions to suppress cellular proliferation and cellular transformation. It has been proposed that the repression of TGF-β-inducible genes (which function as negative regulators of cell cycle function in mammary epithelial cells) may be pivotal to the cellular transforming ability of ski (41Fawcett T.W., Xu, Q. Holbrook N.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1997; 2: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, autocrine hGH production by mammary carcinoma cells acts in concert to both induce negative regulators and suppress positive regulators of the TGF-β pathway. That autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells results in such coordinated repression of the TGF-β axis is suggestive that many functions of autocrine hGH in mammary epithelial cells may be achieved by simple antagonism of this pathway.PTGF-β was identified as a p53-regulated gene (16Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 25Li P.X. Wong J. Ayed A. Ngo D. Brade A.M. Arrowsmith C. Austin R.C. Klamut H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20127-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells decreased transcription of the PTGF-β gene in a p53-independent manner. Thus, we observe that autocrine production of hGH results in a similar percentage decrease in PTGF-βgene transcription in the absence of the two putative p53-binding sites in the PTGF-β promoter, and the inhibitory effect of autocrine production of hGH by MCF-hGH cells on the PTGF-β promoter was maintained when several PTGF-β gene promoter inactive (p53-(1–143) and p53-(1–273)) or active (p53-(1–281)) mutants of p53 (16Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 42Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7411) Google Scholar) were utilized. Thus autocrine production of hGH by mammary epithelial cells will antagonize the cellular response to p53 and therefore promote inappropriate cell survival potentially leading to neoplastic transformation. p53 is an important mediator of the cellular response to DNA damage and activates genes responsible for both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (43Gewirtz D.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 62: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of p53-regulated genes by autocrine production of hGH is not a general cellular response as autocrine hGH has been demonstrated previously by us to up-regulate two p53 regulated genes, namely GADD45(24Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lee K.O. Morel G. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21464-21475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and p21 waf1/cip1 . 3R. Graichen and P. E. Lobie, unpublished observations.Furthermore, IGF-BP3 is both a p53- (44Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) and hGH-regulated (45Kato Y., Hu, H.Y. Sohmiya M. Endocr. J. 1996; 43: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) gene. Interestingly, there exists a STAT-binding site in the promoter region of the PTGF-β gene (25Li P.X. Wong J. Ayed A. Ngo D. Brade A.M. Arrowsmith C. Austin R.C. Klamut H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20127-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and this may constitute one mechanism for the observed effect of autocrine hGH onPTGF-β gene transcription. STAT molecules can either stimulate or repress transcription depending on the promoter context (46Luo G. Yu-Lee L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26841-26849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 47Groner B. Fritsche M. Stocklin E. Berchtold S. Merkle C. Moriggl R. Pfitzner E. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2000; 10 (suppl.): 15-20Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and hGH has been demonstrated to utilize STATs for many of its transcriptional effects (48Zhu T. Goh E.L. Graichen R. Ling L. Lobie P.E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 599-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the PTGF-β promoter should allow for the precise definition of the regulatory elements utilized by autocrine hGH to suppress PTGF-β gene transcription.We have reported previously that autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells results in increased entry to S-phase (3Kaulsay K.K. Zhu T. Bennett W. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and increased cell number (2Kaulsay K.K. Mertani H.C. Tornell J. Morel G. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We observe here that forced expression of PTGF-β completely prevents S-phase entry by either MCF-MUT or MCF-hGH cells. Thus, decreased expression of PTGF-β would be required for autocrine hGH to promote cell cycle progression of mammary epithelial cells. However, exogenous application of hGH to mammary carcinoma cells (MCF-7) still results in equivalent entry to S-phase (3Kaulsay K.K. Zhu T. Bennett W. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) but without a decrease in PTGF-β expression (this study). It may be that high expression of PTGF-β is incompatible with neoplastic proliferation, and therefore MCF-7 cells already have diminished PTGF-β expression below a critical threshold required for survival and cell cycle progression. This would therefore allow proliferation in response to a mitogen such as exogenously applied hGH without further decreases in the level of PTGF-β. This is concordant with the fact that forced expression of PTGF-β alone results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of mammary carcinoma cells (this study and Ref. 25Li P.X. Wong J. Ayed A. Ngo D. Brade A.M. Arrowsmith C. Austin R.C. Klamut H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20127-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), including mammary carcinoma cells with autocrine production of hGH. It is interesting to note that autocrine hGH production by mammary carcinoma cells results in dramatically increased p21Waf1/Cip1 expression. Increased p21Waf1/Cip1 expression has been associated previously with inhibition of cell cycle progression stimulated by either PTGF-β (16Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) or TGF-β (49Salatino M. Labriola L. Schillaci R. Charreau E.H. Elizalde P.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and we also observe here that forced expression of PTGF-β in MCF-MUT cells results in increased p21Waf1/Cip1. This observation is concordant with the published role of p21Waf1/Cip1 as the major mediator of p53 induced G1 arrest (50el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7889) Google Scholar). However, other investigators (51Jeay S. Sonenshein G.E. Kelly P.A. Postel-Vinay M.C. Baixeras E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated recently that autocrine GH results in specific up-regulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 in Ba/F3 cells associated with cell proliferation. We also report here decreased p27Kip1 expression in MCF-hGH compared with MCF-MUT cells. Interestingly, Raf-mediated cell proliferation is associated with elevated p21Waf1/Cip1, which specifically binds to and activates Cdk4-cyclin D complexes and also with decreased p27Kip1 expression (52Chang F. McCubrey J.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4354-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Autocrine hGH production by mammary carcinoma cells results in increased raf gene expression (24Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lee K.O. Morel G. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21464-21475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and this may be the mechanism for the observed changes in p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 expression. In any case, cell cycle arrest as a consequence of forced expression of PTGF-β in MCF-hGH cells is not due to increased expression of p21Waf1/Cip1. We did observe that autocrine hGH stimulation of mammary carcinoma cells resulted in a dramatic increase in the level of cyclin D1 concordant with the observed increased entry of MCF-hGH cells to S-phase compared with MCF-MUT cells. The level of cyclin D1 is elevated in a high percentage of carcinomas of the mammary gland (53Barnes D.M. J. Pathol. 1997; 181: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and cyclin D1 overexpression in transgenic mice results in formation of mammary carcinoma (54Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Increased expression of cyclin D1 has also been demonstrated to be sufficient for G1 progression in mammary carcinoma cells (28Musgrove E.A. Hui R. Sweeney K.J. Watts C.K. Sutherland R.L. J. Mamm. Gland. Biol. Neoplasia. 1996; 1: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Forced expression of PTGF-β prevented the autocrine hGH-stimulated increase in cyclin D1 observed in MCF-hGH cells. The mechanism by which PTGF-β prevents the autocrine hGH-stimulated increase in cyclin D1 remains to be determined. The level of cyclin D1 is predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level by rapid changes in the activity of the cyclin D1 promoter which is under complex control by multiple signaling pathways (55Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 501-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). We observed here that autocrine hGH production in mammary carcinoma cells results in increased transcription of the cyclin D1 gene which is specifically repressed by PTGF-β. Although p44/42 MAP kinase has been demonstrated to be required for cyclin D1 gene expression (56Amanatullah D.F. Zafonte B.T. Albanese C., Fu, M. Messiers C. Hassell J. Pestell R.G. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we have observed that both autocrine hGH and PTGF-β resulted in increased activation of p44/42 MAP kinase in mammary carcinoma cells, 4D.-X. Liu, R. Graichen, and P. E. Lobie, unpublished observations. and therefore PTGF-β inhibition of cyclin D1 expression is not p44/42 MAP kinase-dependent. The transcription of the cyclin D1 gene is also regulated by STAT5 (57Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and STAT5 is required for GH-stimulated mitogenesis of islet β-cells (58Friedrichsen B.N. Galsgaard E.D. Nielsen J.H. Moldrup A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have observed that PTGF-β decreases STAT5-mediated transcription in mammary carcinoma cells,3 and whether this constitutes the mechanism of the observed PTGF-β decrease in cyclin D1 is under investigation. In any case PTGF-β prevents autocrine hGH-stimulated mammary carcinoma cell cycle progression by inhibition of autocrine hGH-stimulated cyclin D1 expression.In addition to blocking cell cycle progression of mammary carcinoma cells in response to autocrine production of hGH, we observed that forced expression of PTGF-β resulted in apoptotic cell death. Overexpression of PTGF-β has also been demonstrated by other investigators to result in apoptotic cell death of mammary carcinoma cells (25Li P.X. Wong J. Ayed A. Ngo D. Brade A.M. Arrowsmith C. Austin R.C. Klamut H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20127-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In this regard it is interesting that the decreased transcription of the PTGF-β gene is only observed with autocrine-produced and not exogenously added hGH. Similarly, protection from apoptotic cell death is also only provided by autocrine-produced and not exogenously added hGH (3Kaulsay K.K. Zhu T. Bennett W. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus the suppression of PTGF-β gene transcription by autocrine hGH may be one mechanism by which autocrine hGH differentially affects mammary carcinoma cell behavior in contrast to exogenously added or “endocrine” hGH. Presumably the decreased production of PTGF-β will also result in the diminished transcription of pro-apoptotic genes and release of transcriptional repression of genes required for cell survival. Cell survival and cell death genes regulated by PTGF-β in mammary carcinoma cells remain to be identified. hGH may also directly regulate genes required for cell survival, and we have demonstrated recently that autocrine hGH increases transcription of theCHOP gene to result in survival of mammary carcinoma cells in a p38 MAP kinase-dependent manner (24Mertani H.C. Zhu T. Goh E.L. Lee K.O. Morel G. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21464-21475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). What needs to be determined is the mechanism and sequential order by which these genes are regulated by autocrine production of hGH. Detailed and sequential promoter analyses, identification of the relevant transcription factor response elements combined with the relevant dissection of upstream signaling pathways, should allow for the identification of primaryversus secondary or tertiary events in the effects of autocrine hGH on mammary carcinoma cell behavior and in particular apoptotic cell death.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells results in transcriptional repression of thePTGF-β gene with consequent decreases in its protein product and accompanying cellular effects that include cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Thus, one mechanism by which autocrine hGH promotes mammary carcinoma cell survival is by transcriptional repression of protein effector molecules that promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Such a mechanism is analogous and complementary to the ability of hGH to activate transcriptionally the protein effector molecules that stimulate cell cycle progression and cell survival (15Le Roith D. Bondy C. Yakar S. Liu J.L. Butler A. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 53-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined what effects of autocrine hGH on mammary carcinoma cell behavior are mediated directly by autocrine hGH or indirectly via utilization of effector molecules, which themselves directly affect cellular function. The human growth hormone (hGH)1 gene is expressed in epithelial cells of the normal human mammary gland. 2M. Raccurt, P. E. Lobie, E. Moudilou, S. Recher, T. Garcia-Caballero, L. Frappart, G.

Increased epithelial expression of the hGH gene is associated with the acquisition of pathological proliferation, and the highest level of hGH gene expression is observed in metastatic mammary carcinom"

Here we report that S100A4 physically interacts with methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2), the primary target for potent angiogenesis inhibitors, fumagillin and ovalicin. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, S100A4 was found to interact with the N-terminal half of MetAP2. In vitro pull-down assays showed that S100A4 associates with MetAP2 in a calcium-dependent manner. In addition, the binding site of S100A4 was found located within the region between amino acid residues 170 and 229 of MetAP2. In vivo interaction of S100A4 with MetAP2 was verified by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that S100A4 and MetAP2 were co-localized in both quiescent and basic fibroblast growth factor-treated murine endothelial MSS31 cells, in the latter of which a significant change of intracellular distribution of both proteins was observed. Although the binding of S100A4 did not affect the in vitro methionine aminopeptidase activity of MetAP2, the cytochemical observation suggests a possible involvement of S100A4 in the regulation of MetAP2 activity through changing its localization, thereby modulating the N-terminal methionine processing of nascent substrates.

It has been shown that S100A4 is highly expressed in different rodent invasive and metastatic tumor cells (5Ebralidze A. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Afanasyeva A. Senin V. Revazova E. Lukanidin E.M.

Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and that manipulation of the expression of S100A4 in tumor cells results in the alteration of their invasive and metastatic potential (7Davies B.R.

In addition, we and others have recently demonstrated that the elevated levels of S100A4 are associated with the more malignant phenotype and prognosis in human breast and colorectal adenocarcinoma specimens (11Takenaga K.

Robertson L. Barraclough R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1595-1603PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms by which S100A4 affects the invasive and metastatic phenotypes of tumor cells remain to be solved, the expression level of S100A4 has been shown to correlate positively with the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (13Bjornland K. Winberg J.O. Odegaard O.T. Hovig E. Loennechen T. Aasen A.O. Fodstad O. Maelandsmo G.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4702-4708PubMed Google Scholar) and cell motility (6Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Endo H.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4587-4591PubMed Google Scholar). S100A4 is also expressed in a variety of normal cells including lymphocytes and vascular endothelial cells (17Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Cell Struct. Funct. 1994; 19: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Gibbs F.E.M. Barraclough R. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P.S. Wilkinson M.C. Parry E.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A promising approach to gain insight into the functions of this protein might be studies on its target proteins. Indeed, nonmuscle tropomyosin (19Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Hasegawa Y. Sato K. Endo H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (20Kriajevska M.V. Cardenas M.N. Grigorian M.S. Ambartsumian N.S. Georgiev G.P. Lukanidin E.M.

Minami H. Morita T. Tugane S. Ishikawa R. Kohama K. Tomida Y. Hidaka H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have been reported as the targets, suggesting a possible participation of S100A4 in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility (6Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Endo H. Sakiyama S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Ford H.L. Salim M.M. Chakravarty R. Aluiddin V. Zain S.B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2067-2075PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, two other proteins, S100A1 (23Wang G. Rudland P.S. White M.R. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11141-11146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and tumor suppressor p53 protein (24Grigorian M. Andresen S. Tulchinsky E. Kriajevska M. Carlberg C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22699-22708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), have been demonstrated to interact physically and functionally with S100A4.Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2)1 is one of two enzymes that catalyze the co-translational removal of the initiator methionine residue from nascent peptides in eukaryotes (25Bradshaw R.A. Brickey W.W. Walker K.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 263-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In addition to its methionine aminopeptidase activity, MetAP2 is shown to regulate protein synthesis by protecting the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2) from phosphorylation (POEP activity) (26Datta B. Ray M.K. Chakrabarti D. Wylie D.E. Gupta N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20620-20624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Ray M.K. Datta B. Chakraborty A. Chattopadyay A. Meza-Keuten S. Gupta N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recently, MetAP2 has been identified as a physiologically relevant target for potent angiogenesis inhibitors, fumagillin and ovalicin (28Sin N. Meng L. Wang M.Q. Wen J.J. Bornmann W.G. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6099-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar,29Griffith E.C., Su, Z. Turk B.E. Chen C. Chang Y-H., Wu, Z. Biemann K. Liu J.O. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). A synthetic analog of fumagillin, TNP-470, selectively and covalently binds to MetAP2 and blocks its aminopeptidase activity, but not its POEP activity, at the comparable concentrations required for inhibition of endothelial cell growth (30Turk B.E. Griffith E.C. Wolf S. Biemann K. Chang Y-H. Liu J.O. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 823-833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the growth of endothelial cells is much more sensitive to this compound than that of tumor cells (31Kusaka M. Sudo K. Matsutani E. Kozai Y. Marui S. Fujita T. Ingber D. Folkman J. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 32Yanase T. Tamura M. Fujita K. Kodama S. Tanaka K. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2566-2570PubMed Google Scholar). MetAP2 is thus thought to concern endothelial cell proliferation through N-terminal methionine processing of as yet unknown proteins essential for endothelial cell growth (30Turk B.E. Griffith E.C. Wolf S. Biemann K. Chang Y-H. Liu J.O. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 823-833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).In an effort to identify additional target proteins for S100A4, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system and screened a cDNA library with S100A4 cDNA as bait. Here, we report that MetAP2 is a new target for S100A4.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we demonstrated for the first time that the metastasis-associated gene product, S100A4, interacts with an angiogenesis-related protein, MetAP2. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, the nucleotide sequences of 7 out of 27 cDNA inserts of plasmids isolated from positive transformants obtained using the yeast two-hybrid system were highly homologous to that of MetAP2. Indeed, the amino acid sequence encoded by the longest cDNA insert, termed J6-2, was identical to amino acid residues 1–229 of MetAP2. The remaining 20 transformants were found to be false-positive. Second, GST pull-down assays clearly showed that S100A4 physically interacted with MetAP2-(1–229) and the full-length MetAP2 as well in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Third, S100A4 was co-immunoprecipitated with MetAP2-(1–229) from the cell lysate of 293 cells expressing both proteins. Fourth, S100A4 was co-localized with MetAP2 in both quiescent and bFGF-treated MSS31 cells.GST pull-down assays showed that calmodulin, another member of EF-hand type calcium-binding proteins, did not interact with MetAP2. Although this observation clearly demonstrated the structural specificity of EF-hand proteins to be interacted with MetAP2, it is interesting to examine whether other S100 proteins also associate with MetAP2. S100A1 and S100A6 were chosen because of their relatively high sequence homology and the same cytoplasmic localization with S100A4, and their interactions with MetAP2-(1–229) were examined by the GST pull-down assay. The results showed that they could bind to MetAP2-(1–229) in the presence of calcium ion, although possibly with different affinity. To date, some 19 different proteins have been assigned to the S100 protein family. They show different degrees of homology, ranging from 25 to 65% identity at the amino acid level (4Schaefer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). It is of note that some of them share the common target proteins, for example, S100A2 and S100A4 associate with non-muscle tropomyosin and F-actin (19Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Hasegawa Y. Sato K. Endo H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Watanabe Y. Usada N. Minami H. Morita T. Tugane S. Ishikawa R. Kohama K. Tomida Y. Hidaka H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), S100A8, S100A9, and S100B to vimentin (4Schaefer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), and S100B and S100A4 to p53 (24Grigorian M. Andresen S. Tulchinsky E. Kriajevska M. Carlberg C. Kruse C. Cohn M. Ambartsumian N. Christensen A. Selivanova G. Lukanidin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22699-22708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 40Delphin C. Ronjat M. Deloulme J.C. Garin G. Debussche L. Higashimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10539-10544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, the specificity of target proteins for S100 proteins is not strict and this also seems to be true in the case of MetAP2 binding. However, it is known that the members of the S100 family have a cellular and/or restricted tissue distribution (2Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 4Schaefer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). For instance, S100A2 is mainly localized in cell nucleus, whereas S100A1, S100A4, and S100A6 in the cytoplasm. In this sense, there might be little chance for S100A2 to interact with MetAP2. As for tissue-specific distribution, S100A1 is abundantly expressed in cardiomyocytes, slow-twitch skeletal muscle cells, salivary epithelial cells, renal cells, and hippocampal neurons, S100A2 is in the lung and kidney, S100A4 is in fibroblasts, myoepithelial cells, and tumor cells, whereas S100A6 is mainly expressed in fibroblasts and tumor cells (2Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar,4Schaefer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). These data suggest, therefore, that individual S100 proteins might function in the cell types where they are expressed.MetAP2 (also known as p67) is a glycoprotein, the carbohydrate moieties of which are required for its POEP activity (41Datta B. Datta R. Mukherjee S. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Datta B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has been reported that p67-glycosylase, which removes O-linked GlcNAc moieties from MetAP2, inactivates the POEP activity when it is activated and subsequently increases phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2) (41Datta B. Datta R. Mukherjee S. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the carbohydrate moieties of MetAP2 are important for its physiological function. These observations, together with the fact that the interaction between S100A4 and the in vitro translated MetAP2-(1–229) was apparent but the in vivo interaction seemed to be weak and transient, led us to imagine that the glycosylation state of MetAP2 might affect the interaction with S100A4. To address this question, the interaction of the recombinant human full-length MetAP2 purified from insect cells with human S100A4 was examined, because the recombinant MetAP2 was shown to be glycosylated (29Griffith E.C., Su, Z. Turk B.E. Chen C. Chang Y-H., Wu, Z. Biemann K. Liu J.O. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The results showed that the interaction indeed occurred between the two proteins, clearly indicating that glycosylation is unrelated to the interaction.It was of great interest to determine whether S100A4 affects the physiological functions of MetAP2. Mammalian MetAP2 is known to be bifunctional. It exhibits not only POEP activity but also methionine aminopeptidase activity. Interestingly, it is differentiated from its prokaryotic counterpart such as E. coli MetAP1 by a highly charged N terminus of 165 amino acid residues in length, which carries alternating polybasic and polyacidic stretches of a similarly sized segment (43Arfin S.M. Kendall R.L. Hall L. Weaver L.H. Stewart A.E. Matthews B.W. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7714-7718Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These stretches have been thought to concern functional regulation of MetAP2 through interaction with nucleic acids and proteins (44Cutforth T. Gaul U. Mech. Dev. 1999; 82: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Giglione C. Serrero A. Pierre M. Boisson M. Meinnel T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5916-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In fact, it is reported that the N-terminal 159 amino acids are responsible and sufficient for the POEP activity (42Datta B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MetAP2-(1–229) consists of this domain and the additional region of 70 amino acids. These observations suggest that the binding of S100A4 to the N-terminal region of MetAP2 could result in modulation of the POEP activity. With this possibility in mind, we first tried to narrow down the binding site of S100A4 on MetAP2 to determine whether the binding site resides within the N-terminal 159 amino acids. By using four deletion variants of MetAP2, the region responsible for the binding with S100A4 was found to be within 60 amino acid residues, Arg170-Ala229. This result implied that S100A4 might not directly influence the POEP activity of MetAP2, although further work is required to conclude this notion. The binding region of S100A4 was adjacent to amino acid residue His231 to which TNP-470 binds covalently leading to inhibition of the aminopeptidase activity (30Turk B.E. Griffith E.C. Wolf S. Biemann K. Chang Y-H. Liu J.O. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 823-833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Noteworthy is the finding that TNP-470 shows no effect on the POEP activity but strongly inhibits the aminopeptidase activity of MetAP2. Thus, we tried to determine the effect of S100A4 on the aminopeptidase activity of MetAP2. Unexpectedly however, the enzymatic activity was not affected at all even in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess amount of S100A4 in the reaction mixture, despite the interaction that both proteins indeed occurred under the same conditions (data not shown).Although any direct effects of S100A4 on MetAP2 activity could not be obtained as above, we tried to address if the binding of S100A4 to MetAP2 has certain physiological meanings. We investigated the intracellular localization of both proteins in endothelial MSS31 cells. S100A4 is reported to be expressed in endothelial cells (18Gibbs F.E.M. Barraclough R. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P.S. Wilkinson M.C. Parry E.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and MetAP2 has been shown to play an essential role for the regulation of endothelial cell growth (30Turk B.E. Griffith E.C. Wolf S. Biemann K. Chang Y-H. Liu J.O. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 823-833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Indeed, Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of S100A4 and MetAP2 in MSS31 cells. Besides S100A4, S100A6 was also expressed in the cells, whereas S100A1 was not. As the binding of S100A4 to MetAP2 was likely to be much higher than that of S100A6 in the GST pull-down assay, it seems reasonable to imagine that S100A4 mainly concerns the interaction with MetAP2 in MSS31 cells. Meanwhile, immunocytochemical staining of S100A4 and MetAP2 clearly showed that both proteins were co-localized in a perinuclear zone of quiescent MSS31 cells. Upon treatment with bFGF, S100A4 changed its intracellular localization and became more diffuse in whole cytoplasm. It is known that S100A4 changes its localization in the cells when the intracellular calcium level is elevated (46Mueller A. Baechi T. Hoechli M. Schaefer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 111: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because a rise in intracellular calcium level was detected after treatment of MSS31 cells with bFGF (date not shown), our observation is in line with these previous studies. Intriguingly, we noticed that MetAP2 also changed its localization, together with S100A4. Moreover, the amount of MetAP2, but not of S100A4, was increased in bFGF-treated cells. Both the amount and the localization of MetAP2 began to change around 8 h after the bFGF treatment (data not shown). These observations implicate that S100A4 and MetAP2 play physiological roles in concert in endothelial cells. It is possible that S100A4 can be activated first in endothelial cells after an increase of intracellular calcium ion caused by certain angiogenesis-inducing cytokines such as bFGF or VEGF, then interact physically with MetAP2, and consequently shift its location in the cell. Through these processes, S100A4 might change the accessibility of MetAP2 to its substrates and concerns regulation of endothelial cell growth. Further studies are in progress to examine these possibilities.Much evidence has been presented on the regulation of invasion and metastasis of tumor cells by S100A4 (5–16). On the other hand, there is so far no evidence indicating the involvement of MetAP2 in invasion and metastasis. Although we compared the expression level of MetAP2 between low and high metastatic cells from murine lung, colon, and mammary carcinoma and melanoma we could not detect any difference (data not shown). Therefore, the amount of MetAP2 may not be directly correlated with metastatic potential. However, this does not necessarily exclude the possible involvement of MetAP2 in regulating invasion and metastasis. It is well known that removal of the initiator methionine is necessary for post-translational modification of the N terminus region, such as myristoylation and acetylation, which are required for the proper location of proteins (25Bradshaw R.A. Brickey W.W. Walker K.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 263-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 47Kendall R.L. Yamada R. Bradshaw R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 398-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 48Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). If S100A4 changes the cellular localization of MetAP2 in invasive and metastatic tumor cells, metastasis-related molecules can then be modulated to change their localization. In this way, S100A4/MetAP2 interaction might result in the enhancement of invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. It would be of interest to test this possibility in future work. Calcium-binding proteins transduce intracellular calcium signals to many biological processes including protein phosphorylation, enzyme activities, cell proliferation and differentiation, dynamics of cytoskeletal organization and Ca2+ homeostasis, and regulate the cytosolic Ca2+ level (1Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). S100 proteins are structurally related to the well known EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, such as calmodulin and troponin C, and comprise 19 members that are differentially expressed in a variety of cell types (2Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 3Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. 2001; 33: 638-668Google Scholar, 4Schaefer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). S100A4, one member of the S100 protein family, is a small acidic protein consisting of 101 amino acid residues (2Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 3Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. 2001; 33: 638-668Google Scholar, 4Schaefer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Expression of theS100A4 gene (also known as pEL98/mts1/p9Ka/18A2/calvasculin/CAPL) has been implicated in cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and neoplastic progression (2Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 3Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. 2001; 33: 638-668Google Scholar, 4Schaefer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). In particular, the observations that S100A4 is involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis have attracted attention. It has been shown that S100A4 is highly expressed in different rodent invasive and metastatic tumor cells (5Ebralidze A. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Afanasyeva A. Senin V. Revazova E. Lukanidin E.M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 6Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Endo H. Sakiyama S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and that manipulation of the expression of S100A4 in tumor cells results in the alteration of their invasive and metastatic potential (7Davies B.R.

In addition, we and others have recently demonstrated that the elevated levels of S100A4 are associated with the more malignant phenotype and prognosis in human breast and colorectal adenocarcinoma specimens (11Takenaga K.

Although the precise mechanisms by which S100A4 affects the invasive and metastatic phenotypes of tumor cells remain to be solved, the expression level of S100A4 has been shown to correlate positively with the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (13Bjornland K.

https://openalex.org/W2094015663,"Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 are members of the Rad family of checkpoint proteins that are required for both DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoints and are thought to function as sensors in the DNA integrity checkpoint control. These proteins can interact with each other and form a stable proliferating cell nuclear antigen-related Rad9·Rad1·Hus1 heterotrimeric complex that might encircle DNA at or near the damaged sites. In this study, we demonstrate that the human Rad9 (hRad9) protein contains a predicted nuclear localization sequence (NLS) near its C terminus, which plays an essential role in the hRad9-mediated G2 checkpoint. Deletion experiments indicate that the NLS-containing region of hRad9 is critical for the nuclear transport of not only hRad9 but also human Rad1 (hRad1) and human Hus1 (hHus1), although this region is not required for hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 complex formation. In support of the role that hRad9 NLS plays in the nuclear targeting of the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 complex, overexpression of a deletion mutant of hRad9 lacking the NLS-containing C-terminal region can bypass the G2 checkpoint and result in cell death after ionizing radiation or hydroxyurea treatment. Moreover, knockdown of hRad9 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) results in hRad1 accumulation in the cytoplasm and significantly abrogates the G2 checkpoint in the presence of damaged DNA or incomplete DNA replication. Thus, the C-terminal region of human Rad9 protein is important for G2 checkpoint control by operating the transport of the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 checkpoint complex into the nucleus.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). If left unrepaired, it can lead to genomic instability, a major contributory factor in the development of cancer and other genetic diseases. To maintain the genomic integrity, multicellular organisms also have the option to eliminate mutated or damaged cells by initiating programmed cell death or apoptosis. Indeed, many of the genes required for cell cycle control and DNA repair are also required for induction of apoptosis in response to DNA damage (2Paulovich A.G. Toczyski D.P. Hartwell L.H.

In fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, genetic studies demonstrated that members of the Rad family of proteins including Rad1, Rad3, Rad9, Rad17, Rad26, and Hus1 are required for cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage or inhibition of DNA synthesis (4Zhou B.B.

Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), suggesting that the checkpoint signaling cascade controlled by these proteins is evolutionarily conserved. Rad3 and its human homologues, ATR and ATM, are members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein family that play critical roles in early signal transduction through cell cycle checkpoints (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). These kinases are likely to be activated in response to checkpoint signals and phosphorylate downstream targets such as Chk1 and Chk2 in order to coordinate cell cycle progression and DNA repair (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 4Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). The activated Chk1 or Chk2, in turn, phosphorylates the mitosis-promoting phosphatase Cdc25, which results in the cytoplasmic accumulation and/or catalytic inhibition of Cdc25, thereby preventing activation of the mitotic cyclin B·cdc2 complex and inducing G2 arrest of the cell cycle (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, the phosphorylation of Chk1 by Rad3 requires Hus1, Rad1, Rad9, Rad17, and Rad26 (14O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), suggesting that this group of proteins could function as sensors of DNA damage. Interestingly, molecular modeling analysis has revealed that Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 as well as their human homologues share regions of sequence similarity to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (15Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 16Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). PCNA is an essential factor that functions in eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication machinery and plays a critical role in DNA recombination, repair, and several other cellular processes (19Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 236-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Stillman B.

The functional complex consists of three PCNA molecules that associate in a head-to-tail manner, thus forming a ring-shaped complex that encircles DNA and functions as a DNA sliding clamp for the replicative DNA polymerases (22Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 23Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Indeed, evidence has accumulated that Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 as well as their mammalian homologues can associate with each other and form a stable heterotrimeric complex in intact cells (16Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24St. Onge R.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Based on the PCNA model, the Rad9·Rad1·Hus1 complex has been proposed to function as a checkpoint sliding clamp that encircles DNA for the recruitment of the checkpoint signaling machinery to the sites of lesions or stalled replication forks (14O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that Ddc1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiaehomologue of Rad9, associates with DNA at the site of double-strands breaks in budding yeast (26Kondo T. Wakayama T. Naiki T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Science. 2001; 294: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 27Melo J.A. Cohen J. Toczyski D.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analogy between PCNA and the Rad9·Rad1·Hus1 complex is extended further by the finding that Rad17 shows structural and functional similarity to the replication factor C subunits (18Venclovas C. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), a clamp loading complex that controls the loading of the PCNA clamp onto DNA (21Tsurimoto T. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D849-D858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that Rad17 functions as a putative clamp loading complex to recruit the Rad9·Rad1·Hus1 complex and load it onto the damaged DNA (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 14O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In support of this sliding clamp model, Rad17 and its homologues in other organisms have been shown to form a stable complex with four small subunits of replication factor C but do not interact with the large subunit, Rfc1 (14O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 28Rauen M. Burtelow M.A. Dufault V.M. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 11236-11241Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies indicated that hRad9, hRad1, and hHus1 form a heterotrimeric complex (9-1-1) in a head-to-tail manner similar to those observed in the PCNA homotrimer (30Burtelow M.A. Roos-Mattjus P.M. Rauen M. Babendure J.R. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25903-25909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As predicted by the information from the PCNA alignment, the C-terminal region of hRad9 that does not align with PCNA is not required for interactions with hRad1 and hHus1 (30Burtelow M.A. Roos-Mattjus P.M. Rauen M. Babendure J.R. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25903-25909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this work, we provide evidence that the C-terminal region of hRad9 plays an essential role in the nuclear localization of the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 complex and the G2 checkpoint control after DNA damage. The pCMV2-FLAG-hRad9 and pEGFP-C2-hRad9 plasmids were described previously (3Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–267 and 261–391 of hRad9 protein, designated as PLD and CD, respectively, were amplified by PCR using hrad9cDNA as template. The amplified hrad9 DNA fragments were sequenced and subcloned into pCMV2-FLAG, pCDNA3-Myc, or pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) vector. To construct pFLAG-hRad9 (ΔNLS) and pEGFP-hRad9 (ΔNLS) expression plasmids, hrad9cDNA (3Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI andBlpI, and the DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–347 of the hRad9 protein was subcloned into pCMV2-FLAG and pEGFP-C2 vectors. The pcDNA3-HA-hRad1, pcDNA3-Myc-hRad1, and pcDNA3-Myc-hHus1 plasmids were constructed by subcloning hRad1 or hHus1 cDNA (31Komatsu K. Wharton W. Hang H., Wu, C. Singh S. Lieberman H.B. Pledger W.J. Wang H.-G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5291-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) into pcDNA3-HA or pcDNA3-Myc vector. HeLa and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 293 cells and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. 293T cells were transfected by a calcium phosphate precipitation method. Ordinarily, a total of 10–15 μg of plasmid DNA was used for transfection of 1–2 × 106 cells, and cells were collected after 2 days of transfection and applied to experiments. HeLa cells and 293 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) or TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus) according to the respective manufacturer's recommendations. The 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes were synthesized and purified by Dharmacon Research (Boulder, CO). The siRNA sequence targeting hRad9 (GenBankTM accession number U53174) corresponded to the coding region 232–252 (5′-AAGUCUUUCCUGUCUGUCUUC-3′) relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. The siRNA sequence targeting GFP (GenBankTM accession number U57606) was from position 322–342 (5′-AAGACCCGCGCCGAGGUGAAG-3′) after the start codon. The transfection of siRNA duplexes was performed one to three times over a 3-day period with the manufacturer's protocol for oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, 3 μl of oligofectamine reagent was mixed with 12 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 7–10 min and then incubated with a mixture of 3 μl of 20 μm siRNA duplex and 50 μl of Opti-MEM for an additional 20–25 min at room temperature. After 32 μl of fresh Opti-MEM was added, 100 μl of siRNA·oligofectamine complexes was applied to each well of cultured cells at ∼50% confluence in a 24-well plate. 293 or HeLa cells were exposed to 20 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR) or incubated with medium containing 1 mm hydroxyurea (HU). For determination of mitotic indices, cells were incubated with 400 ng/ml nocodazole for 20 h after 1 h of IR or 6 h of HU treatment. After fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde and staining with DAPI, the mitotic cells were visualized and counted using a fluorescence microscope. Cells with clear condensed chromatin and/or fragmented nuclei were determined to be apoptotic. MCF-7 cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes targeting hRad9 or were mock-transfected for 2 days, followed by irradiation with 40 Gy of IR, or left untreated. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and incubated for 30 min with 100 μg/ml RNase A and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide at room temperature. DNA content analysis was accomplished by flow cytometry. Immunoblot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence experiments were basically carried out as described previously (3Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32Hirai I. Wang H.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 345-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modification. For immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analysis, cell lysates were prepared in an appropriate volume of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors (32Hirai I. Wang H.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 345-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and normalized for protein content. Briefly, immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 300 μg of total cell lysate with 15 μl of protein G-agarose preadsorbed with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody or with protein G-agarose as a negative control for 3 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing in lysis buffer, beads were boiled in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer, and the eluted proteins were subjected to immunoblotting analysis with polyclonal antibodies specific for FLAG, HA, or Myc epitope. For immunofluorescence studies, cells were seeded into 24-well plates containing coverslips pretreated with collagen and cultured overnight, followed by transfection with either expression plasmid DNA or siRNA duplexes, as indicated. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After preblocking with 5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, followed by three washes in phosphate-buffered saline and incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:30; Dako) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline before staining with 0.1 μg/ml DAPI and analysis by fluorescence microscopy. The anti-hRad9 polyclonal antiserum was described previously (3Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The anti-hRad1 polyclonal antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Larry M. Karnitz (25Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody, anti-HA polyclonal antibody, anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody, and anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads were purchased from Sigma. The anti-Myc polyclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was produced by 9E10 hybridoma (American Type Culture Collection). The hRad9 protein is 391 amino acids in length and shares a structural similarity to the PCNA (10Lieberman H.B. Hopkins K.M. Nass M. Demetrick D. Davey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13890-13895Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Venclovas C. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 33Cai R.L. Yan-Neale Y. Cueto M.A., Xu, H. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27909-27916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, hRad9 also contains a Bcl-2 homology 3-like domain near its N terminus (amino acids 16–30) that is important for its interactions with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL during apoptosis (3Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,34Yoshida K. Komatsu K. Wang H.G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3292-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the role of the PCNA-unrelated C-terminal region of hRad9, which contains appropriately 120 amino acids, has not been examined. Thus, we constructed deletion mutants encoding the PLD (amino acids 1–267) or the CD (amino acids 261–391) of the hRad9 protein (Fig. 1 A). These hRad9 proteins were expressed as GFP fusion proteins in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the wild-type hRad9 protein was mainly localized in the intranuclear space, consistent with the previous studies (3Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, nuclear-localized GFP signal was also observed in cells expressing CD fusion protein (Fig.1 B, d and n). In contrast, the C-terminal deletion mutant PLD was dominantly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B, c and m). These results suggested that the C-terminal region of hRad9 might contain a nuclear localization sequence(s). To explore this possibility, we performed a motif search against the human Rad9 protein using the PSORT II computer prediction program (36Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). This search revealed that a potential NLS lies near the C terminus (amino acids 356–364) of the hRad9 protein (Fig. 1 A). To confirm whether this region is required for the nuclear transport of hRad9, we expressed a mutant GFP-hRad9 (ΔNLS) protein that lacks the C-terminal 44 amino acids of hRad9 (the region in which the predicted NLS resides) (Fig.1 A) and examined its intracellular localization in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the fluorescence resulting from the GFP-hRad9ΔNLS molecules was also dominantly detected in the cytoplasm, similar to that observed in GFP-PLD-expressing cells, indicating that the NLS-like region plays an essential role in the nuclear localization of the hRad9 protein. Next, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to examine the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 checkpoint complex formation in cells. 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding myc-tagged hHus1, HA-tagged hRad1, and FLAG-tagged hRad9 or hRad9 mutants (PLD, CD, or ΔNLS) or parental control vector. Cells were collected and lysed 2 days later, and the protein expression of these transgenes was confirmed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibodies specific for FLAG, HA, or c-Myc epitope (Fig.2 A). A total of 300 μg of cell lysates was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Fig. 2 B, F) or recombinant protein G-agarose (C) as negative control. The resulting immune complexes were analyzed using polyclonal antibodies specific for FLAG, HA, or c-Myc to detect FLAG-hRad9, HA-hRad1, or myc-hHus1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 B, hRad9 and hRad9 mutants were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG M2-agarose but not control protein G beads. Consistent with the previous reports (8Hang H. Lieberman H.B. Genomics. 2000; 65: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24St. Onge R.P. Udell C.M. Casselman R. Davey S. Mol. Biol.

This association between hRad9, hRad1, and hHus1 was not affected by deletion of the C terminus of hRad9. In addition, the C-terminal region of hRad9 (CD) failed to co-immunoprecipitate with hRad1 and hHus1. These results, together with the previous report (30Burtelow M.A. Roos-Mattjus P.M. Rauen M. Babendure J.R. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25903-25909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), indicate that the PCNA-like region of hRad9 is necessary and sufficient for formation of the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 complex. The data presented above revealed that the C-terminal region of hRad9 is not involved in hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 complex formation but is required for the nuclear localization of hRad9. To determine whether this C-terminal region of hRad9 also plays a role in the nuclear targeting of hHus1 and hRad1, HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding myc-hHus1 and HA-hRad1 together with GFP-hRad9, GFP-hRad9 mutants (PLD or CD), or control protein GFP expression plasmids. After 2 days of LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection, cells were fixed and stained with anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody to detect the myc-tagged hHus1 protein. As shown in Fig. 3 A, e andm, myc-hHus1 was localized in the cytoplasm of cells co-transfected with myc-hHus1 and control protein GFP in the presence of HA-hRad1 (to stabilize hHus1 expression), consistent with our previous report (31Komatsu K. Wharton W. Hang H., Wu, C. Singh S. Lieberman H.B. Pledger W.J. Wang H.-G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5291-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, co-expression of GFP-hRad9 resulted in nuclear co-localization of myc-hHus1 and GFP-hRad9 in the presence of HA-hRad1 (Fig. 3 A, b, f,j, and n). However, the hRad9 mutant (PLD) that lacks the NLS-containing region of hRad9 (Fig. 1) but is capable of interacting with hHus1 and hRad1 (Fig. 2) sequestered myc-hHus1 in the cytosol (Fig. 3 A, c, g,k, and o). Moreover, the C-terminal region of hRad9 was confirmed in the nucleus but failed to target myc-hHus1 into the nucleus (Fig. 3 A, d, h,l, and p), consistent with the failure of this region to form a complex with hHus1 and hRad1 (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained for hRad1 (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the C-terminal region of hRad9 is required for targeting the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 complex into the nucleus. Because the hRad9 mutant PLD could retain hHus1 and hRad1 in the cytoplasm, we examined the dominant negative effect of this mutant on the G2 checkpoint of the cell cycle. 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding myc-tagged PLD or parental control vector. Two days after transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with 1 mm HU or 20 Gy of IR. After 1 h of IR exposure and 6 h of HU treatment, 400 μg/ml nocodazole was added to the cell cultures to capture the cells that had bypassed the G2 checkpoint (37Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 38Bao S.

Cells were fixed and stained with DAPI, and the apoptotic and mitotic cells were visualized and counted by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig.4 A, ∼15% of cells died by apoptosis when transfected with the cytosolic hRad9 mutant PLD, compared with <5% of those transfected with control vector. Treating cells with either IR or HU induced apoptosis, which was enhanced by PLD transfection. These results are consistent with the fact that this cytosolic N-terminal fragment of hRad9 contains a Bcl-2 homology 3-like domain, which is critical for its cell death-inducing function and its interactions with the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (3Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Indeed, PLD was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL in 293T cells (data not shown). Interestingly, overexpression of the PLD protein slightly increased (∼1.2-fold) the proportion of mitotic cells (Fig. 4 B). IR or HU treatment caused a nearly complete block of the G2-M transition of the cell cycle in cells transfected with control vector (Fig.4 B). However, a significant proportion (10–13%) of PLD-transfected cells bypassed the G2 checkpoint after HU or IR treatment (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that the C-terminal deletion mutant of hRad9 could exert a dominant negative effect on the G2 checkpoint in response to DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication by sequestering the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 checkpoint complex in the cytosol. To further investigate the role of hRad9 in the G2 checkpoint, we treated the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 with siRNA to inhibit endogenous hRad9 expression. Cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting hRad9 or control GFP two to three times during 3 days of incubation, and the protein levels of hRad9 were evaluated by immunoblot analysis with anti-hRad9 antibody. As shown in Fig.5 A, the 21-bp RNA duplexes targeting hRad9 dramatically reduced the hRad9 protein in MDA-MB-468 cells. This reduction of hRad9 expression was also confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. Cells transfected with siRNAs were fixed, permeabilized, stained with antibodies specific for either hRad9 or hRad1, and visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody under fluorescence microscopy. Whereas the endogenous hRad9 protein was clearly detected in the nucleus of MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with the control GFP siRNA duplexes, the immunofluorescence staining of hRad9 was apparently reduced in cells transfected with siRNA targeting hRad9, indicated by thearrowheads (Fig. 5 B). Cells labeled with anti-hRad1 antibody showed that endogenous hRad1 was localized mainly in the nucleus of MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with siRNA targeting GFP (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, reduction of hRad9 expression by the siRNA duplexes targeting hRad9 resulted in a mostly diffuse distribution of hRad1 throughout the cell (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that hRad9 is required for the nuclear localization of the hRad1 protein. To determine the role of hRad9 in cell cycle checkpoint, MCF-7 cells were transfected with 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes targeting hRad9 or mock-transfected as control. After 2 days of transfection, cells were exposed to 40 Gy of IR and cultured for an additional 24 h before DNA content analysis by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig.6 A, >40% of the mock-transfected cells accumulated in G2-M phase of the cell cycle after IR treatment. However, treating cells with hRad9 siRNA duplexes apparently reduced IR-induced accumulation of G2-M cells, suggesting that hRad9 is important for DNA damage checkpoint. These results were confirmed in MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with siRNAs targeting hRad9 or control GFP and treated with 20 Gy of IR or 1 mm HU. To capture all cells that are capable to bypass the G2 checkpoint, nocodazole was added after 1 h of IR exposure or 6 h of HU treatment. The mitotic cells were stained with DAPI and counted under a fluorescence microscope. As shown in Fig.6 B, transfection of MDA-MB-468 cells with siRNA targeting hRad9 slightly promoted G2-M transition of the cell cycle compared with control GFP siRNA treatment. MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with control GFP siRNA revealed a clear G2arrest of the cell cycle after IR or HU treatment (Fig. 6 B). However, a significant proportion (8–15%) of cells transfected with siRNA against hRad9 bypassed the G2 checkpoint after IR or HU treatment (Fig. 6 B), indicating that hRad9 plays an important role in activation of the G2 checkpoint by IR or HU. The findings reported here indicate that the hRad9 protein functions to target the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 checkpoint complex into the nucleus. This is supported by the observations that hRad9 contains a predicted NLS near its C terminus that allows for its transport into the nucleus. This C-terminal region of hRad9 in which the NLS-like domain resides is sufficient to target the GFP protein into the nucleus, whereas deletion of the NLS-containing region from the hRad9 protein results in accumulation of hRad9, hRad1, and hHus1 in the cytoplasm (Figs. 1 and 3). Moreover, the region of hRad9 predicted to share a PCNA-like structure is necessary and sufficient for the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 complex formation (Fig. 2), consistent with the previous reports in human and yeast (30Burtelow M.A. Roos-Mattjus P.M.

In S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, molecular and genetic studies have indicated that Rad1 (scRad17), Rad9 (scDdc1), and Hus1 (scMec3) are essential and function in the same pathway for activation of the G2 checkpoint after DNA damage or replication block (4Zhou B.B.

Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3744-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, computational modeling studies have predicted that Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1 share structural similarity with PCNA, thus leading to the proposal that these proteins could form a PCNA-like donut-shaped sliding clamp (15Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 16Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In agreement with this model, all three proteins, Rad1, Rad9, and Hus1, were found in the same complexes (16Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 39Kaur R. Kostrub C.F. Enoch T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3744-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, their human homologues, hRad1, hRad9, and hHus1, have been reported to form a head-to-tail association similar to those seen in the PCNA homotrimer (30Burtelow M.A. Roos-Mattjus P.M. Rauen M. Babendure J.R. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25903-25909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study, we also showed that hRad9 could co-immunoprecipitate together with hRad1 and hHus1 (Fig.2). Although the non-PCNA-like region at the C terminus of Rad9 is not required for interactions with Rad1 and Hus1, it is essential for Rad9 to activate the G2 checkpoint signaling cascade (39Kaur R. Kostrub C.F. Enoch T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3744-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a C-terminal deletion mutant of Rad9 in fission yeast sequesters Hus1 and Rad1 in a nonfunctional complex, thus allowing cells to enter mitosis in the presence of HU (39Kaur R. Kostrub C.F. Enoch T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3744-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In agreement with the yeast studies, our results indicate that overexpression of a deletion mutant of hRad9 (PLD) that lacks the C-terminal domain of hRad9 sequesters hHus1 and hRad1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3) and hinders activation of the G2 checkpoint after radiation or HU treatment (Fig. 4). This suggests that hRad9 plays an essential role in regulation of the G2 checkpoint by controlling the nuclear localization of hRad1 and hHus1. In fact, reduction of hRad9 expression by siRNA duplexes targeting hRad9 resulted in cytoplasmic accumulation of hRad1 and defects in the G2 checkpoint (Figs. 5 and 6). In S. pombe, knockout of Rad9 causes the failure of the G2-M checkpoint after radiation or HU treatment, allowing cells to enter mitosis (10Lieberman H.B. Hopkins K.M. Nass M. Demetrick D. Davey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13890-13895Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the nuclear localization of Hus1 and Rad9 is dependent on the presence of Rad17 and that Rad9 but not Rad1 is required for Hus1 to be localized to the nucleus (16Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of hRad9 is required for targeting the functional hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 complex into the nucleus. Further evidence supporting this conclusion comes from observations that the hRad9 protein contains a predicted NLS at its C terminus and that the NLS-containing region of hRad9 is sufficient to transport the GFP protein into the nucleus (Fig. 1). In contrast, expression of theS. pombe Rad9 protein in mammalian cells revealed a cytosolic distribution (data not shown), suggesting that it may use a different mechanism than hRad9 for nuclear transport. Indeed, we could not find any NLS-like region in the yeast Rad9 protein. Taken together, we conclude that the hRad9 protein contains distinct domains with separate functions. First, the N-terminal Bcl-2 homology 3-like domain is important for the interactions of hRad9 with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (3Komatsu K. Miyashita T. Hang H. Hopkins K.M. Zheng W. Cuddeback S. Yamada M. Lieberman H.B. Wang H.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 34Yoshida K. Komatsu K. Wang H.G. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3292-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Second, the PCNA-like region is necessary and sufficient for formation of the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 checkpoint complex. Finally, the non-PCNA-related C-terminal domain located outside of the hRad9·hRad1·hHus1 complex acts to guide this multiprotein complex into the nucleus, where it is involved in activation of the G2 checkpoint in response to DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication.

Sulfonylurea receptors (SURx), members of the ATP binding cassette family of proteins, associate with the inward rectifier Kir6.x to form ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP). These channels are found on the plasma membrane in many tissues and play a pivotal role in synchronizing electrical excitability with cell metabolic state. Trafficking defects resulting from three independent SUR1 mutations involved in the disease persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy have been described. Two of these mutations displayed notable decreases in glycosylation. Here we have investigated the relationship between the two N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn10 and Asn1050) and SUR1 trafficking. Using patch clamp analysis, surface biotinylation, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate a significant decrease in surface expression of SUR1 single or double glycosylation site mutants (N10Q,N1050Q) when co-expressed with Kir6.2. Additionally, we show prominent retention within the ER of the SUR1 double glycosylation mutant under the same conditions. Further investigation revealed that mutation of the ER retention signal was able to partially restore surface expression of the SUR1 double glycosylation mutant. These studies suggest that SUR1 glycosylation is a key element for the proper trafficking and surface expression of KATP channels.

Following export to the Golgi, the sugar moieties are trimmed back, and additional glycan moieties are then added. This “mature” protein is then shuttled to the plasma membrane (2Helenius A. Aebi M.

KATPchannels are found on the plasma membrane in many tissues and play a pivotal role in synchronizing electrical excitability of the cell with its metabolic state (16Ashcroft S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signalling. 1990; 2: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). These subunits together coordinate ATP and ADP binding with channel opening and closing. SURx regulates the flow of potassium ions through Kir6.x. Different isoforms of SURx and Kir6.x contribute to distinct nucleotide binding affinities and orchestrate tissue-specific electrical responses to metabolism (17Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T.

While KATP channels have widespread distribution, including expression in the brain and heart, the role of KATPchannels has been best characterized in pancreatic β cells where it is a key mediator of insulin secretion (18Cook D.L.

Increases in blood glucose cause closure of pancreatic KATP channels, triggered by an increase in the cellular ATP to ADP ratio. This results in membrane depolarization, Ca2+ influx and insulin release (for review, see Refs. 20Ashcroft S.J. J. Membr.

Sulfonylurea drugs and potassium channel openers bind to SURx directly and have been used extensively to regulate KATP channel activity (24Dunne M.J. Petersen O.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Accordingly, SUR1 is a drug target in the treatment of PHHI, type II diabetes, as well as other conditions involving SUR2 such as hypertension (for review, see Ref. 20Ashcroft S.J. J. Membr.

Understanding the mechanism of trafficking and protein maturation of SURx is a fundamental first step in resolving its role in disease. SURx is a multispanning integral membrane protein with a predicted molecular mass of ∼170 kDa. Data support a topology model containing 17 transmembrane segments (26Tusnády G.E. Bakos E. Váradi A.

Both SURx isoforms contain twoN-linked glycosylation acceptor sites, and SURx glycosylation results in core and mature forms of the protein (11Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W.

SUR1 is glycosylated on the N terminus (Asn10) and the external loop following transmembrane segment 12 (Asn1050) (13Clement J.P., IV Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U.

Four subunits of SURx are predicted to surround the pore formed by a Kir6.x tetramer, resulting in a heterooctomer (13Clement J.P., IV Kunjilwar K. Gonzalez G. Schwanstecher M. Panten U. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 827-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This complicated structure presumably comes together in the ER. Both SURx and Kir6.x have been shown to contain ER retention signals (30Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the physical interaction between SURx and Kir6.x masks the respective ER retention signals allowing export to the Golgi and then the plasma membrane. Recent studies of voltage-gated potassium channels showed that glycosylation promotes surface expression (5Khanna R. Myers M.P. Lainé M. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34028-34034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another study, however, of the inward rectifier potassium channel Kir3.1 showed no effect of glycosylation (6Pabon A. Chan K.W. Sui J.L., Wu, X. Logothetis D.E. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30677-30682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). While specific correlative studies on SUR1 glycosylation and the surface expression of KATP have not been carried out, SUR1 has been shown to have an increase in surface expression as well as glycosylation with mutation of the ER retention signal in the absence of Kir6.2 (30Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SUR1 ΔF1388 and SUR1 L1544P mutants that lacked surface expression displayed diminished glycosylation (8Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Here we have investigated the relationship between the glycosylation of SUR1 and surface expression of KATP. We utilized patch clamp analysis, surface immunofluorescence localization, and surface biotinylation techniques to demonstrate a significant decrease in the surface expression of SUR1 in the absence of glycosylation. Additionally, we show prominent retention within the ER of the SUR1 double glycosylation mutant. Furthermore, we characterized the influence of Kir6.2 with regard to SUR1 glycosylation as well as in the facilitation of SUR1 to the plasma membrane. In all constructs, hamster SUR1 was tagged at the C terminus with the V5 epitope by subcloning into the vector pcDNA3.1/V5HisA (Invitrogen). N-Linked glycosylation sites were removed by replacing asparagine 10 and/or asparagine 1050 with glutamines (SUR1 N10Q, SUR1 N1050Q, and SUR1 N10Q,N1050Q) (27Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J.

SUR1 ΔF1388 was introduced into SUR1 with the V5 epitope in pcDNA3.1/V5HisA with ligation (8Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In some constructs, denoted SUR1AAA, the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal RKR (amino acids 648–650) was replaced with alanines. Constructs used in immunofluorescence also contain the M2 FLAG tag at external amino acid position 337 (28Conti L.R. Radeke C.M. Shyng S.L. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol.

COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with constructs encoding SUR1 (0.7 μg), rat Kir6.2 (0.4 μg) (27Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol.

Patch clamp recordings from excised inside-out patches were made 48–72 h following transfection. The standard bath (intracellular) and pipette (extracellular) recording solution (K-INT) contained 140 mmKCl, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm K-EGTA, pH 7.3. Currents were recorded from excised inside-out membrane patches exposed to K-INT bath solution + 1 mm ATP (as the potassium salt) at −60 mV at room temperature as described previously (8Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Micropipette resistance was typically 0.6–2 MΩ. Data from multiple patches were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with SUR1 constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Forty-eight h post-transfection, cells were washed three times with PBSCM (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS, containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2). Cells then were treated with 1 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min to reduce disulfide bonds. Following three washes with PBSCM, cells were incubated with 50 μm N α-(3-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (biotin maleimide, Molecular Probes). The reaction was quenched with 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and the cells were washed two times with PBSCM. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal 6–30 (Nonidet P-40)) containing protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by rotation at 4 °C for 1 h, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 21,000 × g. Equivalent amounts of SUR1 protein in cell lysates were used in each pull-down sample to compare surface accessibility of endogenous external cysteine residues. NeutrAvidin-agarose beads (Pierce) (20 μl) were washed three times with lysis buffer and added to cell lysate to pull down biotinylated protein. The mixture was allowed to incubate overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with a high salt solution (500 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and once with 50 mmTris, pH 7.5. Proteins were eluted in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer by incubation at 85 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), transferred onto nitrocellulose, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS for 1 h. The blot was incubated with anti-V5-HRP antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) to detect SUR1 and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence SuperSignal® West Femto (Pierce). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with SUR1 constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Twenty-four h following transfection, tunicamycin (1 μg/ml) was added to the medium. Twenty-four h following addition of tunicamycin, cells were harvested by addition of lysis buffer as described above. Proteins were subject to SDS-PAGE analysis, and SUR1 was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. COS-1 cells plated on coverslips were transiently transfected with FLAG-SUR1 (0.7 μg) constructs with or without Kir6.2 (0.4 μg). Forty-eight h post-transfection, coverslips were washed two times with PBSCM and then were incubated at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:400, Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Cy3 (1:400, Jackson Laboratory) at 4 °C for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Three 10-min washes with PBSCM followed each antibody incubation. Following fixation with cold methanol (−20 °C, 15 min), cells were washed and mounted onto slides with Pro-Long (Molecular Probes) mounting medium. Cells were visualized with a ×20 objective lens using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescent microscope, and images were recorded with an Optronics CCD-camera (DEI-750). COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with FLAG-SUR1 constructs (0.7 μg) with or without Kir6.2 (0.4 μg) and pECFP-ER or pECFP-Golgi (0.3 μg) (CLONTECH), plasmids encoding enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) fused to a sequence targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (targeting sequence of calreticulin) or the Golgi (N-terminal 81 amino acids of the precursor to the human β-1,4-galactosyltransferase), respectively. Forty-eight h post-transfection, cells were washed two times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then incubated in block (PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% horse serum, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Coverslips then were incubated with anti-V5 antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) for 1 h. Cells were incubated with secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Cy3 (1:400, Jackson Laboratory) for 1 h. Three 10-min washes with PBS followed each antibody incubation. Cells were mounted onto slides with Pro-Long (Molecular Probes) mounting medium and visualized with a ×100 objective lens using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescent microscope. Images were recorded with an Optronics CCD camera (DEI-750). To examine the effect of glycosylation in SUR1 trafficking and surface expression, the two N-linked glycosylation sites on SUR1 were replaced with glutamines to form single glycosylation mutants (SUR1 N10Q, SUR1 N1050Q) and double site glycosylation mutant (SUR1 N10Q,N1050Q). When co-expressed with Kir6.2, wild type (WT) SUR1 and single glycosylation mutants showed two immunoreactive bands corresponding to immature core glycosylated SUR1 and mature complex glycosylated SUR1 as described previously (27Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The complex glycosylated products showed characteristic shifts in mobility with each single glycosylation mutant displaying a decrease in apparent molecular mass when compared with WT SUR1. While the SUR1 N10Q complex and core glycosylated bands showed distinct separation from one another, the SUR1 N1050Q bands consistently migrated as a compact doublet. The SUR1 N10Q,N1050Q double mutant produced only a single band with a mobility similar to that of core glycosylated SUR1. Overall, levels of protein expression appeared unaffected by the lack of glycosylation. The affect of SUR1 N-linked glycosylation on KATP channel surface expression was first explored with patch clamp experiments. All glycosylation mutants (SUR1 N10Q, SUR1 N1050Q, and SUR1 N10Q,N1050Q) yielded functional channels when co-expressed with Kir6.2 in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. In addition, all currents were completely inhibited by the addition of 1 mm ATP. To quantitatively examine KATP channel expression, the current magnitude of the double mutant SUR1 N10Q,N1050Q was compared with WT SUR1. SUR1 N10Q,N1050Q displayed a striking and significant decrease in channel activity compared with WT SUR1 when co-expressed with Kir6.2 (Fig. 2, A andB). Currents in the double mutant were reduced to only 11% of WT SUR1 levels, and this corresponded to both a decrease in the magnitude of current per patch as well as a decrease in the number of patches expressing current. These data suggest that there is a dramatic reduction in KATP channels on the plasma membrane when the SUR1 subunit lacks glycosylation. To determine whether the decrease in current observed in Fig. 2 was a consequence of reduced surface expression, immunofluorescent labeling of surface SUR1 was carried out to assess surface expression. Transiently expressed SUR1 and SUR1 glycosylation mutants containing a FLAG epitope tag inserted at position 337 (at the third external loop) (28Conti L.R. Radeke C.M. Shyng S.L. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41270-41278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were expressed with and without Kir6.2. Live cell labeling with the anti-FLAG antibody was performed at 4 °C to avoid permeabilization or antibody uptake. Consistent with patch clamp analysis, SUR1 N10Q,N1050Q with Kir6.2 showed reduced labeling when compared with WT SUR1 with Kir6.2 (Fig.3). As a negative control, the PHHI mutation SUR1 ΔF1388 demonstrated previously to lack surface labeling when assayed with immunofluorescence, was used in the absence of Kir6.2 (11Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. González G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). As expected, there was no external labeling of SUR1 ΔF1388 (Fig. 3) nor was there external labeling of SUR1 or the glycosylation mutants in the absence of Kir6.2 (data not shown). The decrease in surface labeling of the double glycosylation mutant in the presence of Kir6.2 was due to an alteration in trafficking, not a difference in protein expression, as all FLAG-tagged constructs showed expression comparable with WT SUR1 with Western blot analysis (data not shown). Surface biotinylation was utilized to quantitate relative amounts of total SUR1 protein present on the plasma membrane and thus accessible to external labeling. The cysteine-modifying reagent, biotin maleimide, was used to label endogenous external cysteines of transiently transfected COS-1 cells expressing SUR1. In a previous study of the transmembrane topology of SUR1, we showed that this assay labels endogenous cysteine residues on the external side of SUR1 residing on the plasma membrane, and the reagent does not permeate the membrane to label internal sites (28Conti L.R. Radeke C.M. Shyng S.L. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41270-41278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SUR1 ΔF1388 was used as a control for permeabilization. Surface-biotinylated proteins from whole cell lysates containing equivalent amounts of SUR1 were pulled down with NeutrAvidin beads and visualized by immunoblot following SDS-PAGE. Consistent with patch clamp and surface immunofluorescence data, biotin maleimide labeling of SUR1 N10Q,N1050Q, when co-expressed with Kir6.2, was reduced compared with WT SUR1 (Fig.4 A). Surface biotinylation from multiple experiments was analyzed by densitometry for WT SUR1, single and double glycosylation mutants. Immunoreactive bands were quantitated in parallel for both the pulldowns and the input. The amount of SUR1 that was biotinylated and pulled down was expressed as a percentage of the total SUR1 and represents a lower limit for the amount of SUR1 on the plasma membrane. Multiple experiments were analyzed and plotted (Fig. 4 B). At least 5% of WT SUR1 was labeled on the plasma membrane of COS-1 cells. The double glycosylation mutant displayed only 1.3% surface labeling of SUR1. This reduction corresponds to a decrease to 26% in the surface labeling of mutant compared with WT SUR1 when accounting for the total amount of SUR1 protein expressed. The single glycosylation mutants (SUR1 N10Q, and SUR1 N1050Q) were also investigated and similarly showed a significant decrease in surface expression (Fig. 4 B). Accordingly, biotin maleimide labeling for all of the glycosylation mutants was similar or slightly greater than the negative control SUR1 ΔF1388. Additionally, the apparent molecular mass of the surface-labeled, pulled down SUR1 could be used to infer the glycosylated state of SUR1 on the plasma membrane. While both the immature and mature forms of WT SUR1 were present in whole cell lysates, only the higher apparent molecular mass, mature SUR1 was surface-labeled and pulled down (Fig.4 A). This indicates that only mature glycosylated SUR1 was on the plasma membrane when the native glycosylation sites were available. This trend also was observed for both single glycosylation mutants, SUR1 N10Q and SUR1 N1050Q. An additional upper band also was observed for WT SUR1, most likely a result of aggregation that occurs at the high temperature required to elute biotinylated SUR1 from the NeutrAvidin beads (28Conti L.R. Radeke C.M. Shyng S.L. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41270-41278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, glycosylation promotes surface expression of SUR1 and is clearly indicative of this surface expression. The bulk of the quality control aspects of trafficking have been attr"

GCN5 is the catalytic subunit of a large multi-subunit complex that functions in the regulation of gene activation via acetylation of lysine residues within the N-terminal tails of core histone proteins. Using acetyl-CoA as a co-substrate, the high affinity binding of acetyl-CoA is a critical first step in the reaction. Here, we examine the biochemical and biological importance of a conserved hydroxyl-bearing residue in signature motif A. Interestingly, one major exception is theSaccharomyces cerevisiae GCN5, where an alanine (Ala190) is located in the corresponding position. In related GCN5 family structures, a hydroxyl-containing side chain residue is hydrogen-bonded to the α-phosphate oxygen of CoA. We demonstrate that this key hydrogen bond contributes ∼10-fold to the binding affinity of GCN5 HATs for acetyl-CoA. Human p300/CBP-associating factor, human GCN5, and tetrahymena GCN5 displayed dissociation constants (Kd) for acetyl-CoA of 0.64 ± 0.12, 0.56 ± 0.15, and 0.62 ± 0.17 μm, respectively. In contrast, S. cerevisiae GCN5 displayed a Kd of 8.5 μm. When Ala190 was replaced with threonine, the A190T derivative yielded a Kd value of 0.56 ± 0.1 μm for acetyl-CoA, completely restoring the higher affinity binding seen with the GCN5 homologs that naturally harbor a threonine at this position. Detailed kinetic analyses revealed that the A190T derivative was otherwise catalytically indistinguishable from wild type GCN5. We also demonstrate that the A190Tallele rescued the slow growth phenotype and the defect inHO transcription caused by a deletion of GCN5. Furthermore, the A190T allele supported wild type levels of transcriptionally targeted and global histone H3 acetylation. In each case, the A190T derivative behaved similarly to wild type GCN5, suggesting that the efficacy of HAT activity by GCN5 is not limited by the availability of nuclear acetyl-CoA pools.

In addition to the promoter-targeted histone acetylation function of Gcn5p during gene activation, it also facilitates the maintenance of a basal level of genome-wide histone acetylation, the function of which is not yet understood (21Krebs J.E.

Over the last few years, significant progress has been made toward understanding the structure and catalytic mechanism for the GCN5 family of HATs. With both GCN5 and P/CAF, the catalytic mechanism was shown to involve the initial formation of a ternary complex, where the ε-amine attacks the carbonyl carbon of bound acetyl-CoA substrate, with subsequent acetyl transfer to lysine (26Tanner K.G.

In GCN5, Glu173 serves as a general base catalyst in deprotonating the ε-amine for facile nucleophilic attack on bound acetyl-CoA (26Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.-H. Howard R. Berger S.L.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3521-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have provided additional insights into other key substrate binding interactions. The structures revealed a conserved α/β globular fold where two roughly orthogonal hydrophobic troughs exist along the surface of the protein. Acetyl-CoA binds within one cleft, whereas the lysine-containing peptide binds within the other. The active site is found at the junction of the two troughs and is marked by the presence of the general base Glu173(yeast numbering), although the equivalent base has not been identified in more distantly related family members. Several interactions between the protein and acetyl-CoA were observed. The majority of the interactions with protein involve the pantothenic and pyrophosphate moieties of CoA and are mediated by the highly conserved (R/Q)XXGX(G/A) sequence (motif A, whereX denotes any amino acid). Curiously, immediately C-terminal of the (R/Q)XXGX(G/A) sequence, a threonine or serine is usually found and can be represented as (R/Q)XXGX(G/A)Z (where Z is either threonine or serine). Interestingly, the one major exception to this is yeast GCN5, where an alanine is located in the position ofZ. In all available GCN5 HAT structures, when Zis a hydroxyl-containing side chain residue, this hydroxyl is hydrogen-bonded to an α-phosphate oxygen of CoA. In the yeast GCN5 structure, where alanine is substituted, no compensating residues appear to function in an analogous fashion, suggesting that yeast GCN5 may have significantly less affinity for acetyl-CoA than the corresponding homologs from other species, because of the loss of this hydrogen bond. If true, does this have important biological implications in terms of the in vivo concentrations of acetyl-CoA substrate and the ability of yeast GCN5 to perform its biological function? Here, we examine biochemically the function of this highly conserved hydroxyl group within the GCN5 family of HATs and probe in vivo the functional relevance and implications of substituting this important residue. P81 phosphocellulose disks were purchased from Invitrogen. Dispo-Equilibrium dialyzers were obtained from Amika Corporation. Histone H3 peptide corresponding to the 20 N-terminal residues of human histone H3 and an additional C-terminal cysteine (ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLC) were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Lab at Baylor College of Medicine. Acetyl-CoA was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [3H]Acetyl-CoA (1.88 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were from Fisher, Pierce, or Sigma and were used without further purification. Mutations in the catalytic domain of yGCN5 were generated using the Bio-Rad Muta-gene method and oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations: 5′-CATTAGATGCGAACCATAACC-3′ for A190S and 5′-CATTAGATGCGTACCATAACC-3′ for A190T. The generated mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The catalytic domains of tGCN5 (residues 47–210), hP/CAF (residues 493–658), hGCN5 (residues 505–670), and yGCN5 and its mutant forms (residues 99–262) were recombinantly expressed by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 4 h at 25 °C using the T7-polymerase-based expression system and were purified from BL21-DE3 bacteria as described previously (34Kim Y. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Crude bacterial lysates were subjected to ion exchange chromatography on S-Sepharose. Purified fractions (greater than 90%) containing HAT enzyme, as determined by SDS-PAGE and HAT activity, were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −20 °C until use. The concentration of total protein was determined by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). This value was corrected by densitometric analysis to reflect the total concentration of the HAT enzyme. The yeast strain CY569 (gcn5D, H0-lacZ) was used for the analysis ofgcn5Δ phenotypes in vivo and is described in Ref. 7Pollard K.J. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6212-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar. This strain was transformed with expression plasmids encoding wild type Gcn5p (CP649), a mutant gcn5p containing an A190T mutation (CP914), or no protein (empty vector; BA110). The transformants were selected and maintained on synthetic minimal medium (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco Laboratories), 2% glucose) supplemented with amino acids (minus histidine) as described previously (36Stern M. Jensen R. Herskowitz I. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 853-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). All of the phenotypic analyses were performed in triplicate (three independent transformants) using synthetic minimal medium supplemented with histidine (only for CY569 lacking an expression plasmid), lysine, uracil, leucine, and adenine. The cell doubling times were calculated from cell growth rates, which were determined by measuring the absorbance of growing cultures atA600, using a spectrophotometer. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed using cells grown to mid-log phase, as described previously (36Stern M. Jensen R. Herskowitz I. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 853-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The wild type Gcn5p expression plasmid (CP649) contains the full-length GCN5 gene in pRS313 (also used as empty vector control BA110; Stratagene). The gcn5 A190Tmutant was constructed using the QuikChangeTM XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with CP649 as template plasmid and the following two oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′): GGTACGCGGTTATGGTACGCATCTAATGAATCACTTAAAAG and CTTTTAAGTGATTCATTAGATGCGTACCATAACCGCGTACC. The generated mutation and integrity of the full-length GCN5 gene was verified by DNA sequencing using the PrismTM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxyTM terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HAT activity was measured with [3H]acetyl-CoA and histone H3 peptide as substrates, using a radioactive P81 filter binding assay as described previously (26Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.-H.

Initial velocities were determined for HAT enzymes at 24 ± 1 °C in 5 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. AcCoA saturation kinetics were evaluated for AcCoA concentrations spanning 0.1 to 100 μm at a fixed 1.5 mm concentration (near saturating) of H3 peptide. H3 peptide saturation kinetics were performed at H3 peptide concentrations spanning 25 μm to 1.0 mm at a fixed 100 μm concentration (saturating) of AcCoA. The data were fitted to Equation 1 and are presented in hyperbolic form. v0=(kcat∗[S])/(Km+[S])Equation 1 Pulse-chase experiments were performed to obtain information regarding both kinetic and equilibrium aspects of the yGCN5·AcCoA complex (37Rose I.A.

The percentage of the total labeled substrate converted to product in the initial partitioning event was plotted versus the initial H3 peptide concentration, and the data were fitted to Equation2 [∗P]=[∗Pmax]∗[B]/([B]+KB′)Equation 2 where [B] is the initial concentration of the H3 peptide, [*P] is the percentage of the complex ([3H]acetyl-CoA·yGCN5) partitioned as product ([3H]acetyl-H3 peptide), [*Pmax] is the maximum percentage of the complex that can be trapped as product when [B] is increased infinitely, and K′B is the concentration of B that results in half-maximal partitioning. The dissociation constant (Kd) for AcCoA in the presence of HAT enzyme was determined by equilibrium dialysis using Dispo-Equilibrium dialyzers (Amika Corp.) as described previously (27Tanner K.G. Langer M.R. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11961-11969Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Equilibration conditions were 5 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 3–5 μm GCN5 at 4 °C for 40 h. The concentrations of enzyme-bound AcCoA were determined over a range of total AcCoA concentrations spanning 0–40 μm. The data were fitted to Equation 3 and are presented in hyperbolic form. [AcCoA·Enzyme]=([Enzyme]tot·[AcCoA]free)/(Kd+[AcCoA]free)Equation 3 Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed in triplicate (three independent transformants) using cells grown to mid-log phase and an antibody against diacetylated histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as described previously (21Krebs J.E. Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1412-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. After the final EtOH precipitation, the amount of input and immunoprecipitated DNAs was quantified by PCR. For PCR analysis, either 1/500 (input) or 1/50 (immunoprecipitation) of the DNA was amplified using 50 pmol of both HO SCB2 primers (21Krebs J.E. Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1412-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and ACT1 primers in 20-μl reactions containing 200 μm dNTPs, 3 mmMgCl2, 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and 0.25 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). The ACT1 primers used for PCR are as follows (5′ to 3′): ACAACGAATTGAGAGTTGCCCCAG and AATGGCGTGAGGTAGAGAGAAACC. To determine whether PCR amplification was within the linear range, three consecutive 5-fold dilutions of genomic DNA were included for each PCR primer pair. After 5 min at 95 °C, 26 cycles of 30 s 95 °C, 30 s 60 °C, 1 min 72 °C were performed. PCR products were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and dried. The signals were quantified using a PhoshorImager and ImageQuant v4.2 (Molecular Dynamics). Previous kinetic analyses of the catalytic domains of hP/CAF and wild type yGCN5 (27Tanner K.G. Langer M.R.

The limiting rate in catalytic turnover is the chemistry step (k7; Scheme FS1). These initial analyses demonstrated that hP/CAF and yGCN5 have nearly identical rates of catalysis when both substrates are present at saturating levels (kcat = 2.3 ± 0.07 and 1.7 ± 0.12 s−1, respectively). However, it was observed that hP/CAF binds AcCoA ∼13-fold more tightly than yGCN5 (Kd = 0.64 ± 0.12 and 8.5 ± 2.6 μm, respectively) (27Tanner K.G. Langer M.R. Denu J.M.

Given the similar catalytic efficiencies of GCN5 and P/CAF, it was not clear why there was a dramatic difference in their abilities to bind AcCoA. To uncover the source of these differences, we compared the CoA-bound structures of yGCN5 with hP/CAF (33Clements A. Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Wang L. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R.

Except for yGCN5, in every cased examined, a hydrogen bonding interaction between the α-phosphate oxygen of the pyrophosphate moiety from CoA and a conserved threonine/serine residue (Z in the motif (R/Q)XXGX(G/A)Z) was observed (Fig.1). Interestingly, this threonine/serine residue is conserved in all the GCN5 family of HATs except for GCN5 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yGCN5, there is an alanine at position 190. In GCN5 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a serine residue (Ser208) is found at this position (Fig.2). Moreover, this threonine/serine-mediated interaction is also observed in structural complexes of SmAAT (Thr114) (41Wolf E. Vassilev A. Makino Y. Sali A. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and AANAT (Ser137) (42Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F.

Thus, the hydrogen bonding interaction between CoA and the side chain of this conserved threonine/serine may provide the necessary binding energy to potentiate the observed differences in AcCoA binding between hP/CAF and yGCN5.Figure 2Sequence alignment of the GCN5 family of histone acetyltransferases.

To demonstrate the general importance of this interaction, we kinetically characterized two additional GCN5 family members (hGCN5 from humans and tGCN5 from tetrahymena) that both contain a threonine residue at this position (Thr592 and Thr139, respectively) (Fig. 2). To probe the function of the conserved threonine residue, initial AcCoA saturation kinetics were performed to obtain the steady-state kinetic parameterskcat andKm, AcCoA for tGCN5, hGCN5, and the A190T and A190S mutants of yGCN5. Initial velocities as a function of AcCoA concentration were determined at saturating concentrations of histone H3 peptide (Fig. 3). The data sets for each enzyme were plotted in hyperbolic form and were fitted to Equation 1 using a nonlinear least squares approach.

An intriguing example of a membrane protein thought to interact with a variety of transport proteins is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).1 Mutations in CFTR are the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), a common hereditary disease with pathophysiological abnormalities in a wide range of epithelial tissues. In addition to its role as an epithelial secretory Cl− channel, CFTR has been reported to modify the function of other membrane transport proteins including the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the inwardly rectifying renal outer medullary potassium channel ROMK (Kir1.1) (1Schwiebert E.M.

CFTR, ENaC, and Kir1.1 are co-expressed in the apical membrane of principal cells in the renal cortical collecting duct (CCD) where the fine-tuning of renal sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion occurs. We hypothesized that CFTR may be involved in the coordinated regulation of ENaC and Kir1.1. ENaC provides the rate-limiting step for sodium absorption in a variety of epithelia, particularly in the renal collecting duct. Dynamic regulation of ENaC activity by hormones such as aldosterone and ADH is therefore essential for the maintenance of renal sodium balance and hence for long term regulation of arterial blood pressure (3Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 4Verrey F. Hummler E. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G.

The analysis of two human genetic diseases has provided direct evidence that molecular dysfunction of ENaC has severe effects on arterial blood pressure. Loss-of-function mutations in ENaC cause urinary sodium loss, hyperkalemia, and low blood pressure in patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (5Chang S.S. Gründer S. Hanukoglu A. Rosler A.

Conversely, increased ENaC activity in Liddle's syndrome results in increased sodium re-absorption, hypokalemia, and severe arterial hypertension (6Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M.

In the lungs of CF patients the failure of defective CFTR to inhibit ENaC is thought to cause hyperabsorption of Na+ and fluid possibly contributing to the formation of dry sticky mucus, a hallmark of pulmonary CF pathophysiology. The regulatory relationship between CFTR and ENaC has therefore received considerable attention. Recombinant expression studies (7Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C.

Korbmacher C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C657-C666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism and physiological relevance of a regulatory relationship between ENaC and CFTR are currently the subject of considerable controversy and may vary in different tissues (8Kunzelmann K.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The complexity of the ENaC-CFTR relationship is further demonstrated by recent co-expression studies (13Chabot H. Vives M.F.

This ENaC-mediated increase in CFTR currents may be due to altered single channel properties (increased open probability P o and/or larger single channel conductance) or to an increase in the overall number of CFTR channels expressed in the membrane. Ji et al. (15Ji H.-L. Chalfant M.L. Jovov B. Lockhart J.P. Parker S.B. Fuller C.M. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27947-27956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) used confocal fluorescence microscopy of oocytes expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged CFTR to assess CFTR surface expression. They observed an increase in CFTR fluorescence at, or near to, the plasma membrane in the presence of ENaC and suggested that an increase in surface expression may contribute to the ENaC-dependent increase in CFTR activity. CFTR is abundantly expressed in the native kidney (16Crawford I. Maloney P.C. Zeitlin P.L. Guggino W.B. Hyde S.C. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Harris A. Higgins C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9262-9266Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) including the renal collecting duct (9Letz B. Korbmacher C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C657-C666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Devuyst O. Burrow C.R. Schwiebert E.M. Guggino W.B. Wilson P.D. Am. J.

In immunodissected CCD cells CFTR was found to be most abundantly expressed in CCD β-intercalated cells but was also detected in α-intercalated cells and in CCD principal cells (18Todd-Turla K.M. Rusvai E. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Fejes-Toth G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F237-F244PubMed Google Scholar) where it is co-expressed with ENaC (9Letz B. Korbmacher C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C657-C666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is fair to say that the precise physiological role of CFTR in renal tubular epithelial cells is not yet understood, and renal abnormalities reported in CF patients are subtle (19Wilson P.D. Exp. Nephrol. 1999; 7: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A recent study (20Kibble J.D. Neal A.M. Colledge W.H. Green R. Taylor C.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 526: 27-34Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in salt-restricted mice the natriuresis induced by amiloride was significantly greater in CF mice than in wild-type controls, consistent with an increased renal ENaC activity in CF animals. However, an increased renal sodium absorption via ENaC may remain clinically silent in CF patients known to have increased salt losses due to defective salt re-absorption in the ducts of their sweat glands. One proposed role for CFTR in the kidney is its functional association with Kir1.1 (ROMK) channels to form the native ATP-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channel present in the apical membrane of distal nephron segments, which is responsible for renal potassium secretion. Although heterologously expressed Kir1.1 channels share many characteristics with the native renal secretory K+ channel (21Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), reported differences in their regulation by ATP and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide suggest that Kir1.1 may associate with additional regulatory subunits in vivo. By analogy to the sulfonylurea receptors that confer glibenclamide and nucleotide regulation to the inwardly rectifying K+channels Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, it has been proposed that Kir1.1 may also associate with a renal ABC transporter such as CFTR to form the native secretory K+ channel (22McNicholas C.M. Guggino W.B. Schwiebert E.M. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Egan M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8083-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 23Ruknudin A. Schulze D.H. Sullivan S.K.

The precise mechanisms by which CFTR may influence ENaC and Kir1.1 channel activity remain highly controversial. However, a functional interaction between these ion channels may be physiologically important in the renal collecting duct, and CFTR may provide a functional link between ENaC and Kir1.1. To address this question we performed co-expression studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes using two-electrode voltage clamp and patch clamp recordings in combination with an assay to measure surface expression of these ion channels. We found that the observed stimulation of CFTR currents by ENaC can be accounted for by a parallel increase in CFTR surface expression but that ENaC alone has no effect on Kir1.1. However, in the presence of CFTR, ENaC has a large stimulatory effect on Kir1.1 currents by a parallel increase in Kir1.1 surface expression. This functional linkage was largely disrupted by a mutation in ENaC found in Liddle's syndrome. These findings demonstrate a CFTR-dependent regulation of Kir1.1 by ENaC. This may provide a physiologically relevant link mediating the concomitant up-regulation of Kir1.1 that is observed during stimulation of ENaC by hormones such as aldosterone and ADH. The three subunits of wild-type rat ENaC (rENaC) or of βR564 X rENaC were in the pSD5 vector (gifts from Prof. B. C. Rossier and Prof. L. Schild, Lausanne, Switzerland). Rat Kir1.1 and Kir4.1 were in the oocyte expression vector pBF and human CFTR (a gift from Prof. J.R. Riordan, Mayo Clinic, AZ) in pBluescript KS+. For surface expression studies human CFTR had the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope introduced at amino acid Asn-900 (a gift from Dr. B. Schwappach, Heidelberg, Germany). N-terminal deletion of the first 19 amino acids of Kir1.1a to generate Kir1.1b (ROMK2) (24Zhou H. Tate S.S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed by PCR. By using extension overlap PCR the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was introduced into the extracellular loop of Kir1.1a at position 113 together with a glycine residue before and after the epitope. The sequence reads113 YGYPYDVPDYAGP 114. Capped mRNAs were synthesized in vitro by using the T7 or SP6 mMESSAGEmMACHINE kit (Ambion, TX). X. laevis oocytes were prepared and injected as described (25Konstas A.-A. Mavrelos D. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 441: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Konstas A.-A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with various cRNA combinations. For each ENaC subunit, or potassium channel, 1 ng of cRNA was used, although 20 ng of cRNA were used for CFTR. 5–10 ng of Kir1.1a-HA cRNA were used to achieve adequate current expression. Injected oocytes were kept in modified Barth's saline (in mm: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.3 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, 15 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.6 with Tris) containing 2 μm amiloride to prevent sodium overloading. Unless stated otherwise, oocytes were studied 2 days after injection using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (25Konstas A.-A. Mavrelos D. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 441: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Konstas A.-A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Oocytes were routinely clamped at a holding potential of −60 mV. The barium-sensitive current (ΔIBa2+) was determined by subtracting the corresponding value measured in the presence of 1 mm barium from that measured prior to the application of barium in a KCl solution (in mm: 95 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris). The amiloride-sensitive current (ΔI ami) was determined by subtracting the corresponding current value measured in the presence of 2 μm amiloride from that measured prior to the application of amiloride in a NaCl solution (in mm: 95 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris). The functional expression of CFTR was verified in each batch of oocytes injected with CFTR cRNA, by demonstrating cAMP-induced activation of Cl− currents upon exposure of the oocytes to IBMX/forskolin (1 mm/1 μm). Data are given as mean values ± S.E.; n indicates the number of oocytes;N indicates the number of different batches of oocytes used; significance was evaluated by the appropriate version of Student'st test. Oocytes were assessed by two-electrode voltage clamp recordings to confirm channel expression and were subsequently stripped of the vitellin membrane using sharpened forceps and transferred to a bath chamber on a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope (Leitz Microsystems UK Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK). Single channel currents were recorded at room temperature in the “cell-attached” configuration (27Hamill P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15175) Google Scholar) to avoid channel rundown by patch excision. A computer-controlled EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) was used, and experimental procedures were essentially as described previously (28Koch J.-P. Korbmacher C. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Korbmacher C. Volk T. Segal A.S. Boulpaep E.L. Frömter E. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were pulled from Clark glass capillaries (Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK) and were filled with KCl pipette solution (90 mm KCl, 2 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). They had a resistance of 8.1 megohms (n = 13) in potassium gluconate bath solution (90 mm potassium gluconate, 2 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) which was used in all experiments. In the presence of high extracellular K+ the cell membrane of Kir1.1a expressing oocytes is likely to be depolarized, and the trans-patch potential difference is simply defined as the negative pipette holding potential (−V pip), which can be assumed to correspond to the cytoplasmic potential referred to pipette potential. Downward (negative) current deflections correspond to cell membrane inward currents. Current data were filtered at 1 kHz using a sample rate of 5 kHz. Single channel current amplitudes and channel activity (NP o) were estimated from amplitude histograms (29Korbmacher C. Volk T. Segal A.S. Boulpaep E.L. Frömter E. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Single channel conductance was calculated from the single channel current amplitude at −V pip = −120 mV using Ohm's law. When the apparent number of channels present in a patch recording was greater than 1, NP o was divided by the apparent number of channel levels to give an estimate of single channel open probability (P o), which was determined for each cell-attached patch from a continuous data sample of at least 90 s duration recorded at −V pip = −120 mV. Mean open (t o ) and closed (t c ) times were obtained from traces containing only one channel. Data were analyzed using the program “Patch for Windows” written by Dr. Bernd Letz (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Experiments were essentially performed as described recently (26Konstas A.-A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) using 1 μg/ml rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as primary antibody and 2 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified F(ab)2 fragment goat anti-rat IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) as secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence of individual oocytes placed in 50 μl of Power Signal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay solution (Pierce) was quantified in a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer (Sunnyvale, CA) by integrating the signal over a period of 15 s. Results are given in relative light units. Oocytes were homogenized using 25 oocytes per experimental group. The homogenate was separated by SDS electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Primary rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (100 ng/ml) and secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody (160 ng/ml) were diluted in Tris-buffered saline blocking solution. Detection was performed with the enhanced luminol reagent from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All Western blot experiments were repeated using two different batches of oocytes. To understand the mechanism by which ENaC up-regulates CFTR Cl− currents, we first demonstrated that this effect could be reproduced in our Xenopus oocyte expression system. We used a combination of 1 mm IBMX and 1 μmforskolin (IBMX-FSK) to elevate intracellular cAMP and activate whole-cell macroscopic CFTR Cl− currents that were measured by two-electrode voltage clamp. As shown in Fig.1 A, application of IBMX-FSK to CFTR-expressing oocytes caused a sustained stimulation of a characteristic inward current component (ΔI IBMX+FSK, cAMP-activated CFTR chloride current) that was not observed in water-injected control oocytes (data not shown). Moreover, its partial inhibition by the Cl−channel inhibitor diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC) (1 mm) confirmed that ΔI IBMX+FSK was due to CFTR-mediated Cl− efflux. Fig. 1 B shows that ΔI IBMX+FSK was about 3-fold larger in ENaC/CFTR oocytes (6.86 ± 0.81 μA, n = 21,N = 3) compared with that in CFTR control oocytes (2.54 ± 0.39 μA, n = 21, N = 3;p < 0.001). Similarly, the DPC-sensitive current component was increased by about 3-fold by co-expression of ENaC. Washout and subsequent re-addition of amiloride (2 μm) prior to the application of IBMX-FSK revealed a sizeable amiloride-sensitive inward current component (ΔIami) in ENaC/CFTR oocytes confirming functional expression of ENaC (Fig. 1 B). A second amiloride removal maneuver performed in the presence of IBMX-FSK (Fig. 1 B) demonstrated that ΔI ami was reduced by 54 ± 4% (n = 21; N = 3) during cAMP-mediated stimulation of CFTR. This rules out the possibility that cAMP-mediated stimulation of ENaC contributes to the increasedΔI IBMX+FSK in ENaC/CFTR oocytes and confirms the well established inhibitory effect of cAMP-activated CFTR on ENaC activity. Importantly, our finding that CFTR currents are increased by about 3-fold in ENaC co-expressing oocytes confirm recent studies (13Chabot H. Vives M.F. Dagenais A. Grygorczyk C. Berthiaume Y.

To address the mechanism by which ENaC up-regulates CFTR activity, we used an assay that directly measures surface expression of membrane proteins in the plasma membrane of individual oocytes (26Konstas A.-A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). This assay employs chemiluminescent detection of antibody binding to epitopes introduced into the extracellular domains of membrane proteins. We used a version of CFTR with an extracellular hemagglutinin tag (CFTR-HA), and we measured surface expression in parallel with ΔI IBMX+FSKfrom the same group of oocytes. Fig. 1 C summarizes the results from one of three similar experiments.ΔI IBMX+FSK was significantly higher in ENaC/CFTR-HA oocytes compared with that in matched CFTR-HA oocytes. Moreover, the increase in ΔI IBMX+FSK was paralleled by a similar increase in CFTR-HA surface expression. Consistent with the observations of Ji et al. (15Ji H.-L. Chalfant M.L. Jovov B. Lockhart J.P. Parker S.B. Fuller C.M. Stanton B.A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27947-27956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we found that the stimulatory effect of ENaC onΔI IBMX+FSK and surface expression of CFTR-HA was considerably smaller when using ENaC with a Liddle's syndrome mutation (αβR564 X γ rENaC, Fig.1 C). To rule out an ENaC-dependent increase in CFTR protein synthesis, we performed Western blot analysis on total membrane preparations obtained from the same batch of oocytes. These results demonstrate that the total CFTR-HA protein expression was similar in all three groups of oocytes (Fig. 1 C). In three separate experiments ΔI IBMX+FSK was increased by 173 ± 29% (n = 21; N = 3;p < 0.001) in ENaC/CFTR-HA oocytes and by 47 ± 11% (n = 21; N = 3; p< 0.01) in Liddle/CFTR-HA oocytes when compared with CFTR-HA control oocytes. Similarly, CFTR surface expression was increased by 173 ± 16% (n = 43; N = 3,p < 0.001) in ENaC/CFTR-HA oocytes and by 52 ± 12% (n = 39; N = 3; p< 0.001) in Liddle/CFTR-HA oocytes. These findings therefore demonstrate that ENaC stimulates CFTR currents by increasing surface expression of CFTR. We next examined whether co-expression of ENaC also stimulates Kir1.1. Kir1.1 exists in the kidney in several alternatively spliced isoforms that differ at the distal N terminus. We used the isoform Kir1.1a (ROMK1) known to be expressed in the collecting duct (31Boim M.A., Ho, K. Shuck M.E. Bienkowski M.J. Block J.H. Slightom J.L. Yang Y. Brenner B.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1132-F1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess Kir1.1a currents, the Ba2+ (1 mm)-sensitive K+ current (ΔIBa2+) was determined in the presence of 95 mm extracellular K+, 48 h after cRNA injection. By contrast to its stimulatory effect on CFTR, co-expression of ENaC did not increase ΔIBa2+. Fig.2 A shows the results from one of two similar experiments. At a holding potential of −60 mV, ΔIBa2+ averaged 2.45 ± 0.65 μA (n = 7) in ENaC/Kir1.1a oocytes and 2.84 ± 0.15 μA (n = 7) in matched Kir1.1a control oocytes (Fig.2 A). Thus, co-expression of ENaC alone does not affect Kir1.1a. Given the reported regulatory effects of CFTR on both ENaC and Kir1.1, we tested whether the presence of CFTR influenced the interaction between ENaC on Kir1.1a. We compared the ΔIBa2+ in ENaC/CFTR/Kir1.1a oocytes and in matched CFTR/Kir1.1a control oocytes. Average I/V plots are shown in Fig. 2 B and demonstrate that ΔIBa2+ was significantly increased in ENaC/CFTR/Kir1.1a oocytes compared with CFTR/Kir1.1a oocytes. Individual whole-cell current recordings are shown in Fig. 2,C and D. Note that the Ba2+-sensitive inward current develops slowly after completely substituting Na+ by 95 mm K+ in the bath solution. This slow activation in high extracellular K+ is a well known feature of Kir1.1 currents expressed in Xenopusoocytes (24Zhou H. Tate S.S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On average, ΔIBa2+ (at −60 mV) was 9.40 ± 0.90 μA (n = 42;N = 6) in ENaC/CFTR/Kir1.1a oocytes and 2.66 ± 0.24 μA (n = 42; N = 6;p < 0.001) in matched CFTR/Kir1.1a controls. We also tested whether ENaC and CFTR can stimulate Kir1.1b (ROMK2), a splice variant of Kir1.1a lacking the first 19 amino acids of the N terminus (31Boim M.A., Ho, K. Shuck M.E. Bienkowski M.J. Block J.H. Slightom J.L. Yang Y. Brenner B.M. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1132-F1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ΔIBa2+ was increased by 99 ± 36% (n = 21; N = 3; p< 0.05) in ENaC/CFTR/Kir1.1b oocytes compared with CFTR/Kir1.1b oocytes. These results demonstrate that ENaC stimulates Kir1.1 currents in a CFTR-dependent manner. The average ΔIBa2+ in ENaC/CFTR/Kir1.1a oocytes 18 h after cRNA injection was similar to that in control CFTR/Kir1.1a oocytes. However, a significant stimulatory effect of ENaC was apparent 42 h after cRNA injection and was preserved 66 and 90 h after injection (Fig. 3). The similar currents observed at 18 h rules out the possibility that the stimulatory effect of ENaC was due to a nonspecific effect of the co-injection procedure. The relatively late onset of the stimulatory effect of ENaC was probably due to the slower expression of CFTR which is a large ABC protein. The faster expression of Kir1.1a and ENaC currents was in good agreement with previous studies (24Zhou H. Tate S.S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Konstas A.-A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using the oocyte expression system. These results indicate that measurements must be taken at ∼48 h after injection to see consistent effects. Given that ENaC stimulates surface expression of CFTR, we examined whether the stimulatory effect of ENaC on ΔIBa2+ may be explained by an increased surface expression of Kir1.1a. We therefore measured ΔIBa2+ in parallel with surface expression of extracellular HA-tagged Kir1.1a (Kir1.1a-HA). Results from one of two similar experiments are summarized in Fig. 4. These results demonstrate that in ENaC/CFTR/Kir1.1a-HA oocytes, ΔIBa2+ and surface expression were both increased by about 2.5-fold, compared with the values in CFTR/Kir1.1a-HA control oocytes. On average, ENaC co-expression increased ΔIBa2+ by 128 ± 26% (n = 14; N = 2; p < 0.001) and Kir1.1a-HA surface labeling by 154 ± 26% (n = 19; N = 2; p < 0.001). Interestingly, ENaC with a Liddle's syndrome mutation (αβR564 X γ) had little effect on Kir1.1a-HA currents and surface express"

C., Ohya, S., Horowitz, B., and Greenwood, I. A. (2002) <i>J. Physiol.</i> (<i>Lond.</i>) 539, 107–117). These channels shared a similar relative permeability to various anions, but the expressed channel current lacked the marked time dependence of the native current. In addition, the expressed channel showed a lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity than the native channel. As non-pore-forming regulatory β-subunits alter the kinetics and increase the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels (BK channels) we investigated whether co-expression of β-subunits with CLCA1 would alter the kinetics/Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of mCLCA1. Internal dialysis of human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing CLCA1 with 500 nm Ca<sup>2+</sup> evoked a significantly larger current when the β-subunit KCNMB1 was co-expressed. In a small number of co-transfected cells marked time dependence to the activation kinetics was observed. Interaction studies using the mammalian two-hybrid technique demonstrated a physical association between CLCA1 and KCNMB1 when co-expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. These data suggest that activation of CLCA1 can be modified by accessory subunits."

To investigate whether CD45 also plays a regulatory role in Ig class switching in human B cells, we examined the effects of CD45 triggering on Ig class switching to IgE and its relationship with CD45 JAK phosphatase activity. Anti-CD45 triggering of CD45 significantly inhibited interleukin-4 + anti-CD40-induced switch recombination in a switch recombination vector assay in stably transfected Ramos 2G6 human B cells, as well as Ig ε germ-line transcription and Sμ-Sε switch recombination in primary human B cells. These negative regulatory effects on Ig class switching were concomitant with the ability of CD45 to dephosphorylate the induced phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK3, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6, but not on stress-activated/mitogen-activated protein kinases. We also showed that phosphorylated JAK1 and JAK3 were directly dephosphorylated by recombinant CD45 in vitro. These results indicate that CD45 is able to function as JAK phosphatase in human B cells and that this activity is directly associated with the negative regulation of the class switch recombination to IgE.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). It has been suspected that CD45 might have broader biological effects by acting on additional substrates (10Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been reported recently that (a) CD45 negatively regulates cytokine receptor signaling as a Janus kinase (JAK) phosphatase in hematopoietic cells (11Irie-Sasaki J. Sasaki T. Matsumoto W. Opavsky A. Cheng M. Welstead G. Griffiths E. Krawczyk C. Richardson C.D. Aitken K. Iscove N. Koretzky G. Johnson P. Liu P. Rothstein D.M. Penninger J.M.

These discoveries suggest that CD45 plays a wider role in cytokine- and JAK kinase-mediated B cell function, prompting us to investigate the effect of αCD45 on IL-4 signaling and Ig class switch recombination (CSR) in human B cells. IL-4 is among the most important factors in determining Ig class switching in humans and, in particular, in the production of IgE (13Lebman D.A. Coffman R.L. J. Exp.

The α chain of the IL-4 receptor activates the JAK family members JAK1 and JAK3 via induction of tyrosine phosphorylation, a process that is required for the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STAT 6 (15Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O.

Phosphorylated STAT6 demerits and is translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to the STAT6 consensus sequences in the IgH ε germ-line promoter and activates ε germ-line transcription with production of ε germ-line transcripts (εGTs). Both the process of germ-line transcription and GTs themselves are felt to be important for switching, although the exact roles of each in Ig CSR remain to be determined. For optimal ε germ-line transcription and εGTs production, synergy between IL-4 stimulation and a second signal through CD40 is required (19Shapira S.K. Vercelli D. Jabara H.H. Fu S.M. Geha R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether activation of CD45 could alter isotype switching in human B cells. Switch recombination was quantified employing a recently established switch vector assay (20Zhang K. Zhang L. Yamada T. Vu M. Lee A. Saxon A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), Sμ-Sε recombination in primary B cells was measured by digestion-circularization-PCR (DC-PCR), and εGTs were assessed by RT-PCR. We also examined the effect of αCD45 on IL-4- and αCD40-driven phosphorylation and activation of JAK1, JAK3, and STAT6, as well as phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and extracellular-signal related kinase (ERK). Human IL-4 was purchased from R&D System. Anti-CD40 mAb G28.5 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Anti-CD45 mAb HI30, anti-CD45RA mAb HI100, anti-CD45RB mAb MT4, and anti-CD45RO mAb UCHL1 were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-JAK1 Ab, anti-JAK3 Ab, anti-STAT6 Ab, anti-phosphotyrosine Ab, and anti-phosphorylated STAT6 Ab were purchased from Cell Signaling(Beverly, MA). Anti-JNK Ab, anti-phosphorylated JNK Ab, anti-p38 MAPK Ab, anti-phosphorylated p38 Ab, anti-ERK Ab, and anti-phosphorylated ERK Ab were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant CD45 was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Restriction endonucleases, ligase, and mung bean nuclease used for construction of switch vector came from Promega (Madison, WI) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The human B lymphoma cell line Ramos 2G6 (ATCC) was maintained and cultured in complete RPMI 1640. For transfection, 10 μg of plasmid DNA that had been predigested with AseI was mixed with 1 million cells in 0.2 ml and then subjected to electroporation (200 V, 0.975 millifarads). Selection of stable transfected cell lines was achieved by Geneticin (Invitrogen) selection beginning 2 days later with concentration being increased over a period of 4 weeks to 1.5 mg/ml. The switch construct XF-5a has been described previously (20Zhang K. Zhang L. Yamada T. Vu M. Lee A. Saxon A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy volunteers by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque. Human B cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by T cell depletion after monocytes/macrophages and NK cells were removed. Human B cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Omega, Tarzana, CA). Total mRNA was obtained from stimulated and unstimulated cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA suspended in 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water was digested with DNase I (Sigma) to remove possible contaminating DNA and then extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by precipitation in ethanol. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA as described previously (20Zhang K. Zhang L. Yamada T. Vu M. Lee A. Saxon A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were done in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 2.5 mm MgCl2, each primer at 1 μm, and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Promega). For detection of IgH εGTs and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, PCR was conducted with 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1min, and 72 °C for 1min. The primers GM3 (5′-AGCTGTCCAGGAACCCGACAGGGAG-3′) and Cε2B (5′-GTTGATAGTCCCTGGGGTGTA-3′) were used to amplify εGTs. This set of primers amplifies εGTs as a 518-bp PCR product. Ramos 2G6 cells (1 × 106/ml) were collected by centrifugation and lysed in Triton lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). The lysates were clarified and incubated with excess of protein A-Sepharose 4B (50% slurry). The cleared samples were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibodies (2 μg) and protein A-Sepharose 4B (30 μl) at 4 °C for 1 h followed by washing three times with the lysis buffer. The immune complexes were subject to Western blot analysis as described previously (21Yamada T. Fujieda S. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. Inatome R. Sunaga H. Saito H. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Samples containing equal amount of protein were boiled with electrophoresis sample buffer for 3 min and separated using SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 1% bovine serum albumin, incubated with primary Abs for 1 h at room temperature, and washed followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary Abs for 1 h. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to BioMax film (from Eastman Kodak Co.). Tyrosine phosphatase assays using immunoprecipitated JAK1 and JAK3 from stimulated cells as substrates were performed as described (11Irie-Sasaki J. Sasaki T. Matsumoto W. Opavsky A. Cheng M. Welstead G. Griffiths E. Krawczyk C. Richardson C.D. Aitken K. Iscove N. Koretzky G. Johnson P. Liu P. Rothstein D.M. Penninger J.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recombinant CD45 proteins were diluted in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol), and mixed with immunoprecipitates including phosphorylated JAK1 or phosphorylated JAK3 proteins at 30 °C for 20 min. After the reaction was stopped by boiling the samples with electrophoresis buffer for 3 min, samples were electrophoresed and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Tyrosine phosphorylation was monitored by anti-phosphotyrosine Ab. DC-PCR was used to quantify the levels of Sμ-Sε recombination in stimulated primary human B cells. Genomic DNA was digested with BglII followed by ligation under conditions favoring self-ligation. The resultant ligated DNA was precipitated and the appropriate amounts of DNA was used as templates for PCR with primer a (5′-GATATGCTGTTTGCACAAACTAG-3′) and b (5′-AACAACCCTCATGACCACCAGCT-3′). Amplification for 40 cycles was performed at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The size of the expected PCR product was 222 bp. To verify the amount of ligated DNA between different groups and the efficiency for digestion and ligation of the input DNA sample, the human activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene was used as an unrelated control gene for the DC-PCR assay.BglII digestion would generate a 4578-bp fragment from the human AID gene (EMBL/GenBankTMaccession No. AB040430). Primer pairs AID5 (5′-CCATGGTACAAATCTCAGGACGAATC-3′) and AID6 (5′-AGATGGTGAAACCCCGTCTCTATTAA-3′) were used. This pair of primer would amplify a 238-bp product. PCR was conducted using 20 ng of ligated DNA as templates at 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP) in cell lines stably transfected with the switch vector after the stimulated or unstimulated culture conditions was measured by either single- or dual-color flow cytometry (FACS Core laboratory, UCLA) as described (20Zhang K. Zhang L. Yamada T. Vu M. Lee A. Saxon A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). FACS data were analyzed with FCS expression software (Deno Novo software Inc., Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney's U test in levels of Ig class switch recombination. Macintosh computers (StatView software, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA) were used for all statistical analyses. We tested the ability of different αCD45 reagents, αCD45 (HI30), αCD45RA (HI100), and αCD45RB (MT4), to affect IL-4 + αCD40-driven human Ig isotype switching. We have previously established a switch recombination assay by using GFP as an indicator for SSR in the Ramos 2G6 human B cell line (20Zhang K. Zhang L. Yamada T. Vu M. Lee A. Saxon A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). More than 95% of these Ramos cells express readily detectable levels of CD45, CD45RA, and CD45RB as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). All three αCD45 attenuated IL-4 + αCD40-induced SSR (as indicated by GFP expression) from the switch construct (XF-5a) with αCD45 HI30 showing the greatest inhibition (Fig.1 A). The optimal concentration of all three mAbs was 5–10 μg/ml (data not shown). Thus, αCD45 HI30 was used in most of the following experiments. As shown in Fig. 1 B, IL-4 + αCD40-induced SSR was inhibited by αCD45 in a dose-dependent fashion with the maximal inhibition generally being reached at 5 μg/ml or higher. At these concentrations, αCD45 alone did not significantly alter cell viability nor did it alter viability in IL-4 + αCD40-stimulated cultures (data not shown). It should be noted that GFP expression measures both deletional and inversional recombination events in the constructs (Fig. 1 C) (20Zhang K. Zhang L. Yamada T. Vu M. Lee A. Saxon A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, αCD45-mediated inhibition of the GFP expression in the SSR assay reflects the suppression of recombination activity including both deletional and inversional recombination. As αCD 45 was able to inhibit SSR in the human B cell line, we determined the effects of CD45 stimulation on Sμ-Sε switch recombination in human primary B cells as assessed through a quantitative DC-PCR assay. As shown in Fig.2, Sμ-Sε recombination was readily detectable in IL4 + αCD40-stimulated primary B cells (lane 2) but was not detectable in unstimulated cells (lane 1). The induction of Sμ-Sε recombination was inhibited by αCD45 in a dose-dependent manner, with significant inhibition being achieved at 5 μg/ml (lanes 3–6). It was decreased 85% as measured by semiquantitative analysis using densitometry. To investigate the mechanism by which CD45 triggering interferes with Ig CSR, we examined the effects of αCD45 (HI130) on IL4 + αCD40 induction of εGTs in primary B cells and human B cell lines. Expression of IgH germ-line transcripts from Ig heavy-chain loci precedes the occurrence of isotype switching and has been shown to be important in Ig CSR (23Stevnezer-Nordgren J. Sirlin S. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). αCD45 inhibited IL4 + αCD40-induced εGTs in a dose-dependent manner in both primary human B cells and two human B cell lines, Ramos 2G6 and 2C4/F3 (Fig.3, A and B). The maximum inhibitory effect was achieved at concentrations at or above 5 μg/ml. Based on these results, the subsequent experiments were performed with 5 μg/ml αCD45 unless noted otherwise. To estimate the sensitivity of our PCR assay for the detection of GTs, we serially diluted cDNA as the PCR template and subjected the products to amplification via RT-PCR (Fig. 3 C). The sensitivity of the technique was determined to be 50 pg of total cellular RNA. Semiquantitative analysis by comparison with the data shown in Fig.3 A demonstrated that αCD45 reduced the production of εGTs about 90% compared with the level seen with IL-4 + αCD40 stimulation. IL-4 is known to activate some members of the JAK family protein kinases through phosphorylation (15Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Liu E.T. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 16Keegan A.D. Johnston J.A. Tortolani P.J. McReynolds L.J. Kinzer C. O'Shea J.J. Paul W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1995; 96: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas CD45 was recently shown to be able to function as a JAK phosphatase (11Irie-Sasaki J. Sasaki T. Matsumoto W. Opavsky A. Cheng M. Welstead G. Griffiths E. Krawczyk C. Richardson C.D. Aitken K. Iscove N. Koretzky G. Johnson P. Liu P. Rothstein D.M. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated whether αCD45-mediated inhibition of the εGT induction and Sμ-Sε switch recombination was mediated via regulation of JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylation. IL-4 + αCD40-stimulated Ramos 2G6 cells were treated with αCD45, and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-JAK1 Ab or anti-JAK3 Ab. IL-4 + αCD40 induced a rapid and sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 (Fig. 4, Aand B). On the other hand, IL-4 + αCD40-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK 3 did not occur following αCD45 treatment. Immunoblot analysis with anti-JAK1 Ab and anti-JAK3 Ab revealed comparable total amounts of JAK1 and JAK3 in αCD45-treated or untreated cells, indicating that IL-4 + αCD40-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 was blocked by αCD45. Because activation of STAT6 by JAK kinase is essential in mediating the IL-4 response (18Takeda K. Tanaka T. Shi W. Matsumoto M. Minami M. Kashiwamura S. Nakanishi K. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Nature. 1996; 380: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in both expression of εGTs and isotype switching to IgE (24Linehan L.A. Warren W.D. Thompson P.A. Grusby M.J. Berton M.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 302-310PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether IL-4-induced STAT6 activation was also regulated by αCD45. Samples from appropriately stimulated cells were subjected to Western blot analysis with specific anti-phosphorylated STAT6. As shown in Fig. 5, phosphorylated STAT6 was readily detected after the stimulation. Within 5 min of IL-4 + αCD40 stimulation, STAT6 phosphorylation increased and remained elevated throughout the 20-min incubation. However, after αCD45 treatment, IL-4 + αCD40 failed to induce STAT6 phosphorylation, indicating that triggering of αCD45 strongly inhibited IL-4 + αCD40-induced STAT6 phosphorylation and activation. The inhibition of STAT6 phosphorylation by αCD45 was likely mediated via its effect on JAK kinases. To confirm that CD45 functions as a JAK phosphatase to negatively regulate cytokine receptor signaling in our system, we tested the phosphatase activity of recombinant CD45 in a phosphatase assay for the immunoprecipitated JAK kinases from stimulated Ramos 2G6 cells. Recombinant CD45, which contains the intracellular phosphatase domain but lacked the extracellular portion of CD45, directly dephosphorylated JAK 1 and JAK3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.6). The addition of vanadate, a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, blocked the ability of recombinant CD45 to dephosphorylate both JAK1 and JAK3 (data not shown). We used IL-4 + αCD40 to stimulate human B cells in order to test the effects of CD45 on εGTs induction, Sμ-Sε switch recombination, and the relationship of these outcomes to JAK phosphatase activity. CD40 cross-linking in B cells also induces JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK (25Sakata N. Patel H.R. Terada N. Aruffo A. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol.

Therefore we also examined whether αCD45 plays a role in regulating the induced activation of these kinases. Thus we measured the effects of αCD45 on IL-4 + αCD40-induced phosphorylation of JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK using anti-phosphorylated JNK Ab, anti-phosphorylated p38 MAPK Ab, and anti-phosphorylated ERK Ab. JNK was activated by IL-4 + αCD40, resulting in increased JNK phosphorylation on Thr-183 and Tyr-185 (Fig.7 A). Induced JNK phosphorylation was not inhibited by the same concentration of αCD45 that strongly inhibited JAK phosphorylation (Figs. 4 and7 A). Similarly, the activation of p38 MAPK phosphorylated on Tyr-182 was not significantly altered by αCD45 treatment (Fig.7 B). ERK was only modestly phosphorylated on Tyr-204 in response to IL-4 + αCD40 and was also unaffected by αCD45 treatment (Fig. 7 C). αCD45 itself had no effect on activating these three kinases. In the present study, we tested the ability of CD45 stimulation to directly alter B cells isotype switching to ε and examined the mechanisms underlying this effect. CD45 was able to suppress IL-4 + αCD40-induced expression of εGTs and isotype switching to ε in primary human B cells and B cell lines. CD45 signaling decreased the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK3, and STAT6, molecules that play crucial roles in IL-4-induced isotype switching (24Linehan L.A. Warren W.D. Thompson P.A. Grusby M.J. Berton M.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 302-310PubMed Google Scholar, 30Shimoda K. van Deursen J. Sangster M.Y. Sarawar S.R. Carson R.T. Tripp R.A. Chu C. Quelle F.W. Nosaka T. Vignali D.A. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G. Paul W.E. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that recombinant CD45 directly dephosphorylated JAK1 and JAK3. At the same time, we did not detect any effect of αCD45 on CD40-driven activation of JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK. These findings suggest that CD45 controls isotype switching in human B cells primarily through its function as a JAK phosphatase. The biologic responses induced by IL-4 involve a complex interaction of signaling pathways including the activation of JAK1 and JAK3 and STAT6. Although phosphatases, including SHIP and SHP-1, may regulate IL-4 signaling (31Helgason C.D. Kalberer C.P. Damen J.E. Chappel S.M. Pineault N Krystal G. Humphries R.K. J. Exp.

Irie-Sasaki et al. (11Irie-Sasaki J. Sasaki T. Matsumoto W. Opavsky A. Cheng M. Welstead G. Griffiths E. Krawczyk C. Richardson C.D. Aitken K. Iscove N. Koretzky G. Johnson P. Liu P. Rothstein D.M. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) recently reported in murine system that CD45 negatively regulated cytokine receptor signaling as a hematopoietic JAK phosphatase. In this study, we demonstrated that CD45 directly dephosphorylated JAK1 and JAK3 in human B cell. Thus, CD45 regulates IL-4 signaling, along with suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family members, which have been shown to suppress IL-4 signaling through the inhibition of JAKs (33Losman J.A. Chen X.P. Hilton D. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3770-3774PubMed Google Scholar), and B cell lymphoma gene-6 (BCL-6), which appears to regulate a subset of IL-4-induced genes (34Hartatik T. Okada S. Okabe S. Arima M. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CD40 plays an important role in B cell proliferation, survival, memory, and Ig CSR. Although our initial results demonstrated that CD45 could play a negative role in controlling the induced IgE class switching, they did not prove that the inhibition was exerted only through IL-4 signaling rather than CD40 signaling. This is particularly relevant, as CD40 signaling can activate multiple kinases and signal pathways (26Berberich I. Shu G. Siebelt F. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Clark E.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Craxton A. Shu G. Graves J.D. Saklatvala J. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J.

Recently, it has been reported that p38 MAPK plays an important role in CD40-induction of εGTs (29Brady K. Fitzgerald S. Ingvarsson S. Borrebaeck C.A. Moynagh P.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and we have also found that p38 MAPK is related to Ig CSR in our system. 2K. Zhang, T. Yamada, D. Zhu, and A. Saxon, unpublished data. Thus, we also investigated the effects of CD45 stimulation on IL-4 + αCD40-driven JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK activation to determine whether CD45 was exerting its effects via altered CD40 signaling. We demonstrated that induction of JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK phosphorylation was not significantly altered by CD45 triggering, indicating that CD40-dependent activation of these specific signal pathways was not affected by CD45 triggering. These results, together with the fact that CD45 triggering suppressed IL-4 + αCD40-induced JAK1, JAK3, and STAT6 phosphorylation, provide strong evidence that CD45 functions, at least in part, as a JAK phosphatase in human B cells and thereby inhibits IL-4-dependent class switching to IgE. It remains possible that CD45 may alter other CD40-activated or -dependent signaling pathways, e.g.CD40-involved JAK3 and Lyn (35Hanissian S.H. Geha R.S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 36Ren C.L. Morio T. Fu S.M. Geha R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), that are not known to be involved in class switching processes. Isotype switching is a key event in generation of humoral immunity. IL-4 and CD40 play critical roles in this process. The notion that CD45 might function as a JAK phosphatase, as reported recently (11Irie-Sasaki J. Sasaki T. Matsumoto W. Opavsky A. Cheng M. Welstead G. Griffiths E. Krawczyk C. Richardson C.D. Aitken K. Iscove N. Koretzky G. Johnson P. Liu P. Rothstein D.M. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), was further supported by our results that recombinant CD45 directly dephosphorylated the phosphorylated-JAK1 and -JAK3 in vitro. Our findings showed that IL-4 + αCD40-induced IgE CSR could be suppressed strongly by CD45 engagement, suggesting that CD45-mediated JAK phosphatase activity is responsible for the suppression, because STAT6 activation by phospho-JAK1 and -JAK3 is required for IL-4-dependent εGTs production and subsequent Sμ-Sε recombination. However, inhibition of Sμ-Sε recombination might not be the sole consequence of inhibition of the IL-4-dependent ε germ-line transcription, although the latter may well participate in the inhibition of Sμ-Sε recombination. For example, CD45 might inhibit Sμ-Sε recombination through other steps in CSR, e.g. by altering the activation and/or induction of the putative switch recombinase activity, which is also dependent on cytokine activation (37Kinoshita K. Tashiro J. Tomita S. Lee C.G. Honjo T. Immunity. 1998; 9: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). CD45 has been suggested to be an important gatekeeper in determining early intracellular signaling events by influencing phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of proteins organized in lipid microdomains (rafts) (38Thomas M.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is expressed throughout B cell development and differentiation with the exception of terminally differentiated plasma cells. CD45 has been shown to play an important role in modulating the signal that is transduced via the B cell antigen receptor by regulating Lyn (39Yanagi S. Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Sabe H. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30487-30492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Hasegawa K. Arimura Y. Mitomo K. Okada M. Clark M.R. Mizuno K. Yakura H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1321-1326PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of CD45, specifically in regulating B cell class switching, which we have studied, has not been investigated in detail previously. By showing that CD45 negatively regulates the phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT6, signal transduction molecules known to be critical for IL-4-induced isotype switching, we concluded that CD45 suppressed IgE isotype switching through its JAK phosphatase activity. At the same time, we cannot exclude the possible effects of CD45 on unknown or other molecules including Lyn, for which involvement in the class switching process has not been elucidated. Although recombinant CD45 strongly dephosphorylated JAK1 and JAK3, it is still not clear how αCD45 modulates the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of CD45 so as to decrease IL-4-induced phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3. Whether this is a conformational effect and/or requires cross-linking is unknown. Even though we showed that the intracellular portion of CD45 possessed JAK phosphatase activity in vitro, how CD45 acts as a JAK phosphatasein vivo is also unknown. Finally, developmentally regulated alternative splicing of the single CD45 gene results in multiple isoforms with differences in their extracellular portions and these distinct isoforms are likely associated with differential functions. It has become increasing evident that CD45 can have both positive and negative effects in regulating receptor thresholds and in the resulting biologic outcomes. Thus it is not surprising that the role of CD45 may vary according to cell lineage and developmental stage. Indeed, CD45 activation has been implicated in such disparate events as transplant rejection (8Zhong R.Z. Lazarovits A.I. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), cell adhesion-specific signaling events (41Li R. Wong N. Jabali M.D. Johnson P. J. Biol.

Only by careful analysis in different cell types and at different developmental stages will the central role of CD45 as a regulator in specific diseases be determined. Our data shows that CD45 signaling via its JAK phosphatase activity can regulate IL-4 + αCD40-induced Ig class switching in human B cells, an event that plays a central role in the humoral immune reactivity associated with the TH2 responses seen in allergic disease and raises the possibility of CD45 as a drug target.

Likewise, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to trigger Ca2+-dependent secretion in these secreting cell types as well (11–24). Furthermore, many permeabilized cell studies have also supported a role for PKC in further enhancing the stimulatory action of Ca2+ and GTP in the exocytotic process (9Bader M.F. Sontag J.M.

Neurochem. 1990; 55: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations thus have led to the proposal of a hypothetical exocytotic model by Lillie and Gomperts (30Lillie T.H.W. Gomperts B.D. Ciba Found. Symp. 1993; 176: 164-184PubMed Google Scholar) in which Ca2+, GTP, and PKC act in concert in a regulatory sequence leading to exocytosis (30Lillie T.H.W. Gomperts B.D. Ciba Found. Symp. 1993; 176: 164-184PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, two GTP-binding proteins are involved in controlling the stimulus-secretion process. The first GTP-binding protein is the putative receptor-linked G-protein (GP) that controls the activity of phospholipase C, thereby generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Further downstream from the signal transduction level, a second GTP-binding protein (G E , E for exocytosis), a putative GTPase so far undefined as a molecular entity, acts in parallel, or might be closely associated with a Ca2+-binding protein at the docking/fusion site of the exocytotic machinery. Subsequent phosphorylation by diacylglycerol-activated PKC triggers these proteins into mediating the exocytotic membrane fusion process. Although phenomenologically well known, the specific sites of action of Ca2+, GTP, and PKC in the stimulus-secretion cascade remain unknown. Annexin 7 (ANX7; synexin) is a Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion protein (31Creutz C.E. Scott J.H. Pazoles C.J. Pollard H.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 18: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Hong K. Duzgunes N. Ekerdt R. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rojas E. Burns A.L. Prog. Brain Res. 1992; 92: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), for which recent evidence has strongly suggested the possibility of its involvement in exocytosis. For example, we have reported that ANX7 is a Ca2+-activated GTPase, both in vitro and in secreting chromaffin cells, and that in vitro membrane fusion activity of ANX7 is further enhanced upon binding to GTP (35Caohuy H. Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10797-10802Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). More recently, we have reported that the heterozygous knockout Anx7(+/−) mouse suffers from an insulin secretion deficit from islets of Langerhans, as well as defective Ca2+ signaling processes in β-cells (36Srivastava M. Atwater I. Glasman M. Leighton X. Goping G. Caohuy H. Miller G. Pichel J. Wesphal H. Mears D. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13783-13788Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have reported that ANX7 is phosphorylated by PKC, both in vitro and in secreting chromaffin cells (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by PKC significantly potentiates the ability of ANX7 to fuse phospholipid vesicles, and the apparent K 12 of Ca2+is lowered from 200 to 50 μm (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Sequence and site-directed mutagenesis studies of ANX7 have shown that putative binding sites for GTP are located in proximity to consensus phosphorylation sites for PKC. These data thus have led us to hypothesize that these two processes may modulate the action of each other in activating ANX7-driven membrane fusion. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the interconnections between PKC and GTP action on the Ca2+ dependence of ANX7-driven membrane fusion both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we report that GTPγS and PKC both mutually enhance the binding of each other to ANX7, and also potentiate Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion driven by ANX7.In vitro, phosphorylation of ANX7 by PKC is optimally enhanced by GTP and its non-hydrolyzable analogues. Reciprocally, the binding and hydrolysis of GTP by ANX7 are markedly potentiated by PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation. Whereas certain other kinases label ANX7 efficiently, they do not substitute for PKC in potentiating GTP binding or membrane fusion. In vivo, we find that for ANX7, both the ratio of bound GDP/GTP as well as phosphorylation by PKC change in proportion to the extent of catecholamine release from stimulated chromaffin cells. Thus, GTP and PKC combine specifically to transform ANX7 into a highly efficient Ca2+-dependent membrane fusogen. We therefore conclude that the membrane fusion machinery might include ANX7 as a common site of action for Ca2+, GTP, and PKC in the exocytotic membrane fusion process. PS lipid vesicles were prepared fresh daily by the swelling method (38Reeves J. Dowben R. J. Cell Physiol. 1968; 78: 49-60Google Scholar). Highly purified (>99%) brain phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids) in a 1:4 chloroform-methanol solution was dried slowly under nitrogen and then allowed to swell in 0.3 m sucrose at room temperature. The suspension was then sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g. The PS lipid vesicle pellet was resuspended in sucrose solution. Human recombinant ANX7 was isolated and purified as described (39Burns A.L. Magendzo K. Srivastava M. Rojas E. Parra C. de la Fuente M. Cultraro C. Shirvan A. Vogel T. Heldman J. Caohuy H. Tombaccini D. Pollard H.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 1118-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly,Escherichia coli bacteria containing the ANX7-expressing vector (pTrc-FLS) were grown in 1 liter of Luria broth at 37 °C. After incubation overnight with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside (ICN), the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. Expressed recombinant ANX7 was then extracted from the E. coli paste, concentrated by precipitation with 0–20% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4, and purified by gel filtration using Ultragel AcA54 (Biosphere). This partially purified ANX7 preparation was further purified by binding to PS lipid vesicles in the presence of Ca2+ and extracting with EGTA. This purification step was repeated six times to yield a highly purified ANX7 preparation (≥98%) determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Simultaneous phosphorylation and phospholipid vesicle fusion reactions were carried out as described (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The reactions in a final volume of 1 ml contained 1 μg of ANX7, 0.5 unit of PKC, 0.3 m sucrose, 40 mm histidine (pH 6.1), 2 mmMgCl2, 100 nm PMA, 100 μm ATP, 0.5 ml of lipid vesicle suspension, and with or without 100 μm GTPγS. The controls were carried out in the absence of ATP and/or GTPγS, or in the presence of 500 μmGDPβS. Fusion and phosphorylation were simultaneously initiated by the addition of 1 mm [Ca2+]finalat room temperature. Fusion was measured by the change in the turbidity in absorbance at 540 nm (A 540) over a 30-min period using a recording Hewlett-Packard spectrophotometer. The final Ca2+ concentration was verified using a Ca2+-selective electrode. Fusion and phosphorylation reactions in the presence of other protein kinases were carried out as described for the above PKC experiments, except that no PMA was added. PKC was replaced by 2000 units of PKG (plus 10 μm cGMP), 500 units of PKAcat, or 100 units of pp60c- src . These conditions resulted in mole ratios of Pi to protein of 1.0 (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B.

Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Rat brain PKC, with a purity of “≥95%” and containing isoforms α, β, and γ, was purchased from Calbiochem. To determine the effects of guanine nucleotides on ANX7 phosphorylation, 1 μg of ANX7 was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with 0.05 unit (0.035 μg) of PKC in a final volume of 30 μl of reaction buffer. This buffer consisted of 25 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 nm PMA, 400 μg/ml PS liposomes, and contained one of the following nucleotides, each with a concentration of 100 μm: GTP, GTPγS, GMP-P(NH)P, or GDPβS. For the time course, 1 μg of ANX7 and 0.05 unit of PKC were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated time periods in the presence or absence of 100 μm GTPγS. To determine ANX7 phosphorylation as a function of GTPγS concentration, 1 μg of ANX7 was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with 0.05 unit of PKC in the presence of various concentrations of GTPγS, as indicated in the figure legends. The controls were carried out in the absence of guanine nucleotides. All reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μm[γ-33P]ATP (3000–4000 cpm/pmol; Amersham Biosciences) and terminated by the addition of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics). As for ANX7 phosphorylation by PKA, PKG, and pp60c- src (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), ANX7 (1 μg) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with 200 units of PKG (plus 10 μmcGMP), 50 units of PKAcat, or 10 units of pp60c- src in 25 mm MES (pH 6.1), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 50 μm GTPγS. The controls were carried out in the absence of 50 μm GTPγS. All phosphorylation reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μm[γ-33P]ATP (3000–4000 cpm/pmol) and were analyzed as described above for the PKC reactions. Phosphorylation and extraction of the PKC phosphorylated and unphosphorylated protein from lipid vesicles was performed exactly as previously described (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated ANX7 has a molar ratio of Pi to protein of 2.0. GTP binding of ANX7 was determined with the photoaffinity labeling assay using 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP as described (35Caohuy H. Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10797-10802Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. ANX7 (1 μg) and PKC (0.05 unit) were simultaneously incubated at 30 °C in 25 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 100 nm PMA, 400 μg/ml PS liposomes, 8 μm 8-N3-[γ-32P]GTP (ICN; 10 μCi/mmol), and with or without 100 μm ATP in a final volume of 30 μl. At the indicated times, 4 mm glutathione was added to each sample, and the samples were irradiated for 30 s at room temperature, followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging analysis. Assay of ANX7 GTPase was carried out simultaneously with the phosphorylation reaction, and the hydrolytic products were assayed as described (35Caohuy H. Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10797-10802Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of phosphorylation by PKC on ANX7 GTPase activity, 1 μg of ANX7 was incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times with or without 0.05 unit of PKC in 25 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 nm PMA, and 400 μg/ml PS liposomes, in a final volume of 30 μl. To determine the GTPase activity as a function of ANX7 concentration, the indicated concentrations of ANX7 were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with or without 0.05 unit of PKC in the same reaction condition as above. The controls were carried out in the absence of PKC and ANX7, or in the presence of PKC alone. All reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μm ATP and 50 μm [α-33P]GTP (2000–3000 cpm/pmol;Amersham Biosciences), and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5m EDTA. The reactions (1-μl aliquot) were resolved by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck) in 1 m LiCl: 1 m formic acid. GTP hydrolysis was assessed by quantitating the formation of [α-33P]GDP with a PhosphorImager. The results, after subtracting the background, were calculated as total GDP formed. Background was obtained from the reactions containing PKC alone and without ANX7 and PKC. In other GTPase assays, phosphorylated ANX7 and its unphosphorylated forms, at protein ratios of 3:0, 2:1, 1.5:1.5, 1:2, or 0:3, respectively, were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in the phosphorylation buffer (without ATP, PMA, and PS liposomes) containing 50 μm [α-33P]GTP (2000–3000 cpm/pmol). Each reaction contained the same amount of total ANX7 protein (0.75 μg/30-μl reaction). GTP hydrolysis was assessed by chromatography on polyethyleneimine plates as described above. To determine ANX7 GTPase in the presence of other kinases, ANX7 (1 μg) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with or without 200 units of PKG (plus 10 μm cGMP), 50 units of PKAcat, or 10 units of pp60c- src in 25 mm MES (pH 6.1), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 50 μm[α-33P]GTP. The controls were carried out in the absence of the respective kinases and ANX7, or in the presence of the kinase alone. GTP hydrolysis was analyzed as described above. Chromaffin cells were isolated from bovine adrenal glands by collagenase digestion and purified on Percoll gradient, as described (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Isolated cells were further purified by a selective plating method (40Yanagihara N. Isosaki M. Ohuchi T. Oka M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 105: 296-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and maintained in a CO2 incubator under 5% CO2, 95% air. Cultured chromaffin cells (5 × 106/dish, Falcon, 35 mm) were labeled with [33P]orthophosphoric acid (0.2 mCi/ml;Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-free Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 10 h at 37 °C (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were washed once with Ca2+-free extracellular buffer A (118 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1.2 mm MgCl2). The cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37 °C with or without 50 nm calphostine C (Calbiochem) or 0.7 μmchelerythrine chloride (Calbiochem) in buffer A and then stimulated to secrete by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 100 μm carbachol (Sigma) in extracellular buffer B (buffer A with 2.2 mm CaCl2 added). The control experiments were performed using cells incubated with buffer B or with buffer B containing Me2SO4. The latter solvent was a necessary control for drugs such as calphostine C and chelerythrine chloride, which are soluble in Me2SO4. After incubation, the media were collected for measuring catecholamine secretion. The cells were rapidly washed twice and then lysed in lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation as described below. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer as described (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After clarification by centrifugation, the resulting lysates were precleared by incubation for 30 min with 50 μl of a 10% (v/v) suspension of protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by centrifugation. The final lysates, with equal protein amounts determined by the BCA method (Pierce), were incubated with 10 μg of anti-ANX7 monoclonal antibody 10E7 for 6 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were divided into two equal halves, one for determining ANX7 phosphorylation levels and one for assaying GTP/GDP bound to ANX7. All immunoprecipitates were collected on protein G-Sepharose and washed four times by pelleting in ice-cold lysis buffer. In the assay to determine the extent of ANX7 phosphorylation, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Radioactively labeled ANX7 was analyzed by phosphorimaging. To determine the amounts of ANX7 present in the immunoprecipitates, the same membranes were blotted with a polyclonal antibody against ANX7. The bound primary antibody was detected using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized chromographically using 4-chloro-1-naphthol. In the assay to determine the bound GDP/GTP to ANX7 (35Caohuy H. Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10797-10802Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), the immunoprecipitates were incubated for 20 min at 68 °C in elution buffer (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.2% SDS, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm GDP), followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, concentrated by lyophilization, and then resuspended in distilled water to a final volume of 5 μl. The entire samples were spotted on a thin layer cellulose plate (Merck), followed by chromatography in 1 m LiCl, 1 mformic acid buffer. Radioactively labeled nucleotides were analyzed by phosphorimaging. The assay for catecholamine release from chromaffin cells was performed exactly as described previously (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The release of catecholamines was expressed as a total amount released into the medium. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. A relationship between catecholamine secretion and ANX7 phosphorylation and its guanine nucleotide binding profile was assessed by a linear regression analysis (left and right y axes, mean values of the ratio of ANX7-bound GDP/GTP and ANX7 phosphorylation, respectively, induced by carbachol and inhibited by PKC inhibitors;x-axis, mean value of catecholamine secretion under similar conditions as above). The statistical significant values (p) were determined by Student's t test, and a pvalue less than 0.05 was considered significant. Several studies have shown that Ca2+-dependent secretion is further enhanced by the combined action of guanine nucleotides and PKC in vivo (9Bader M.F. Sontag J.M. Thierse D. Aunis D. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1990; 55: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously reported that GTP (35Caohuy H. Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10797-10802Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and PKC (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) independently activate the Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion activity of ANX7in vitro. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the ANX7 membrane fusion activity in vitro might be further potentiated by the combined addition of GTP and PKC. To test this possibility, we examined the ANX7-driven lipid vesicle fusion reaction during simultaneous activation of both the phosphorylation of ANX7 by PKC and the presence of GTPγS on ANX7-induced fusion of lipid vesicles. As the fusion reaction progresses in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, the lipid vesicle fusion activity of ANX7 is indeed activated further by GTPγS plus PKC (Fig.1 A). The rate and extent of lipid vesicle fusion induced by ANX7 under this condition is significantly increased over that of the control, which contains neither GTPγS nor ATP (Fig. 1, A and D,bars 1 versus 2; p < 0.005). In addition, the increasing ANX7 activity stimulated by the combination of individually optimal concentrations of GTPγS and PKC can be distinguished by a simple additive model when comparing activation by either GTPγS or PKC alone (Fig. 1, A andD). Using the above method developed to study the GTPγS plus PKC effect, two additional experiments were carried out to test the specificity of this effect on ANX7 membrane fusion activity. In the first set of experiments, an excess molar concentration of the GDP non-hydrolyzable analogue, GDPβS, was added to the phosphorylation-fusion reaction in the presence of both PKC and 100 μm GTPγS. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the addition of 500 μm GDPβS markedly reduces the lipid vesicle fusion activity of ANX7 stimulated by GTPγS plus PKC, and even abolishes the stimulatory effect of PKC on fusion of lipid vesicles driven by ANX7 under this optimal condition. These data are comparable with the finding of inhibition of Ca2+-dependent secretion by GDPβS from various secretory cell types (9Bader M.F. Sontag J.M. Thierse D. Aunis D. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 298: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the second set of experiments, we tested the consequences of phosphorylation by PKA, PKG, and p60c- src for ANX7-driven membrane fusion, in the presence of 100 μmGTPγS. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the relative rates of lipid vesicle fusion driven by ANX7 under these conditions increase moderately, as observed in the case of PKA or PKG, or show no change, as seen in the case of pp60c- src . As compared with the control activity (Fig. 1 D, bar 1), the increasing membrane fusion activities of ANX7 observed here are induced by GTPγS, but not by the phosphorylation catalyzed by these various protein kinases (Fig. 1 D, bars 6–8). The latter conclusion is consistent with our previous findings that GTPγS enhances ANX7-driven lipid vesicle fusion activity (35Caohuy H. Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10797-10802Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation by either PKA or PKG does not significantly affect this activity, or may even decrease it, as in the case of pp60c- src (37Caohuy H. Pollard H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12813-12821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results thus show that the binding of GTPγS to ANX7, and selective phosphorylation of ANX7 by PKC mutually activate the membrane fusion activity of ANX7 in vitro. To further investigate the mechanism of the additive effect of GTPγS and PKC on ANX7 membrane fusion activity, we examined the effect of GTP and its non-hydrolyzable analogues on the in vitro ANX7 phosphorylation reaction. As shown in Fig.2 A, the levels of phosphorylation of ANX7 by PKC are optimally enhanced by GTP and its non-hydrolyzable analogues. At 100 μm, GTPγS significantly increases the level of ANX7 phosphorylation with a stoichiometry of 1.83 ± 0.22 (Fig. 2 A, bar 2, p < 0.005) after 1 h. By contrast, the molar ratio of ANX7 phosphorylation achieved in the absence of"

LmrP contains one cysteine (Cys270), which was replaced by alanine. This cysteine-less variant was used in a cysteine scanning accessibility approach. All 19 acidic residues in LmrP were replaced one by one by cysteine and subsequently challenged with the large thiol reagent fluorescein maleimide.

These drug efflux processes are mediated by transport proteins, which can be specific for a given drug or class of drugs or can handle a wide variety of structurally unrelated compounds (3Roberts M.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 19: 1-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The latter group of transporters, the so-called multidrug resistance (MDR)1 transporters, can be divided in two major classes: (i) secondary MDR transporters that are driven by a proton or sodium motive force and (ii) ATP-binding cassette MDR transporters, which use the hydrolysis of ATP to fuel transport (6Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 672-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Most bacterial MDR transporters known to date are secondary antiport systems that remove drugs from the cell in a coupled exchange with protons, as exemplified by the MDR transporter LmrP ofLactococcus lactis. LmrP is an 408-amino acid integral membrane protein with 12 putative transmembrane segments (TMSs) that belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (see Fig. 1) (7Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The protein can be functionally overexpressed in L. lactis using the tightly regulated, nisin-controlled expression system (8Putman M. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The number of compounds recognized and transported by LmrP is remarkably vast and includes many structurally diverse lipophilic cations such as ethidium, Hoechst 33342, and tetraphenylphosphonium (6Putman M. van Veen H.W.

A common property of most known substrates of LmrP is their ability to readily intercalate into the lipid bilayer because of their high lipophilicity. This led to the hypothesis that LmrP recognizes its substrates within the membrane and not from the cytoplasm. Transport experiments using the model substrate 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1, 3,5-hexatriene p-toluenesulfonate indeed revealed a relation between the transport rate and the amount of 1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1, 3,5-hexatrienep-toluenesulfonate associated with the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, providing convincing evidence for drug efflux from the membrane to the external medium (10Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W.

Transport experiments in intact cells and in inside-out membrane vesicles further demonstrated that extrusion of cationic drugs by LmrP is driven by both the membrane potential (Δψ) and the transmembrane proton gradient (ΔpH), indicating that LmrP mediates electrogenic nH+/drug (n ≥ 2) antiport (7Bolhuis H.

Interestingly, LmrP-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport is competitively inhibited by quinine and verapamil, noncompetitively by nicardipin and vinblastin, and uncompetitively by tetraphenylphosphonium (11Putman M. Koole L.A. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13900-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These findings are indicative for the presence of multiple drug interaction sites in the multidrug transporter LmrP. However, the molecular basis of multidrug recognition by LmrP is still unclear. To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of multidrug transport by LmrP, it is important to identify residues that are critical for multidrug recognition. The excretion by LmrP of lipophilic cationic compounds predicts the involvement of negatively charged amino acid residues in transmembrane segments of LmrP in substrate binding. In this study, a scanning cysteine accessibility approach (12Dunten R.L. Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12644-12650Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Kaback H.R. Sahin-Toth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) was used to demonstrate that three residues (Asp142, Glu327, and Glu388) of 19 acidic residues in LmrP are located within the membrane domain. The roles of these membrane-embedded acidic residues in multidrug recognition were analyzed. Residues Asp142, Glu327, and Glu388 were systematically mutagenized, and the transport activities of the mutant proteins were measured as the excretion of the cationic drugs ethidium and Hoechst 33342. The results show that the negative charge at position 388 is important neither for active transport nor for multidrug recognition. In contrast, the negative charges at positions 142 and 327 are critical for the multidrug transport character of LmrP. These residues are located in a part of the transporter that becomes solvent-accessible upon interaction with substrates. L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA), which lacks the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette-type MDR transporter LmrA (a kind gift from O. Gajic and J. Kok, Department of Genetics, University of Groningen), was used in combination with the nisin-controlled expression system (14de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kuipers O.P. de Vos W.M. Appl. Environ.

L. lactis cells were grown at 30 °C in M17 medium (Difco) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol when appropriate. Expression of LmrP variants from pNZ8048-derived plasmids was induced by adding ∼10 ng of nisin A/ml at anA 660 of about 0.6, and the cells were harvested 90 min after induction. General procedures for cloning and DNA manipulation were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar) was used to introduce mutations in the lmrP gene on the pHLP5 expression plasmid (8Putman M. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which encodes LmrP with an C-terminal His6 tag. All PCR-amplified DNA fragments were sequenced to verify that only the intended changes were introduced. DNA sequencing was performed at the BioMedical Technology Centre (University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Membrane vesicles with an inside-out orientation were prepared from L. lactis NZ9000 (ΔlmrA) cells expressing LmrP variants by the French press procedure as described by Putman et al. (8Putman M. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The vesicles were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C at a protein concentration of 15–35 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 10% (w/v) glycerol. Expression levels of His6-tagged proteins were determined by running membrane vesicles (20 μg of total protein) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detection with monoclonal antibodies directed against the His6 tag (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The antibodies were visualized by using a Western light chemiluminescence detection kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA) and a Lumi-imager F1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For ethidium transport experiments, whole cells expressing LmrP variants were washed with 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 5 mmMgSO4 and resuspended to an A 660 of 0.5 in the same buffer. The cells (2 ml) were energized by the addition of 25 mm of glucose. After 2 min, 10 μmethidium was added to the cell suspension, and the accumulation of ethidium was measured indirectly by following the fluorescence of the ethidium-polynucleotide complex in the cells. Fluorescence was monitored with a PerkinElmer LS 50B fluorometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 500 and 580 nm, respectively. Transport of Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes Inc.) in inside-out membrane vesicles was measured as described by Putman et al.(8Putman M. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Inside-out membrane vesicles (0.5 mg of protein/ml) were resuspended in 50 mm potassium Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm MgSO4, 8.5 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, and 5 mm phosphocreatine. After incubation for 30 s at 30 °C, 1 μm of Hoechst 33342 was added. Upon the addition of 0.5 mm Mg-ATP, LmrP was activated through the generation of a proton motive force by F0F1 H+-ATPase. The amount of membrane-associated Hoechst 33342 was measured fluorimetrically (PerkinElmer LS 50B) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 457 nm, respectively, and slit widths of 5 nm each. Membrane vesicles (2 mg of protein in 300 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) were incubated in the presence of 50 μm fluorescein maleimide for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with 5 mmdithiothreitol. The vesicles were solubilized with 1% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, debris was removed by centrifugation. To purify His6-tagged LmrP variants, supernatant containing solubilized proteins was mixed with 20 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, which was equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% dodecyl-β-maltoside) and gently shaken for 1 h at 4 °C. Resin was settled down by pulse centrifugation in a table centrifuge, supernatant was removed by aspiration, and resin was washed with 1 ml of buffer A. The protein was eluted with 60 μl of buffer B (50 mm potassium phosphate, 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% dodecyl-β-maltoside). The protein concentration in the eluted fraction was estimated with the RC-DC protein assay kit from Bio-Rad. Similar amounts of protein (2 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins labeled with fluorescein maleimide were detected by UV excitation and were visualized with a Lumi-imager. To test the effect of substrates on labeling of mutant proteins by fluorescein maleimide, the membrane vesicles were incubated with different concentrations of ethidium and Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at 30 °C prior to the addition of the fluorophore. LmrP contains one native cysteine residue, Cys270, that is located in putative transmembrane segment VIII (Fig. 1). A cysteine-less mutant of LmrP was constructed by replacing the native cysteine with alanine (C270A) using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant could be expressed in L. lactis and was present in the cytoplasmic membrane as judged from Western blots using anti-His6 tag antibodies (data not shown). In previous studies, the positively charged compounds ethidium and Hoechst 33342 proved to be useful drugs for studying the transport activity of LmrP in whole cells and inside-out membrane vesicles, respectively (8Putman M. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1002-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ethidium transport in whole cells can be measured indirectly by monitoring the fluorescence of the intracellular ethidium-polynucleotide complex. Ethidium accumulation by LmrA-deficient, glucose-energized, nonexpressing control cells and cells expressing wild-type LmrP demonstrated that wild-type LmrP can reduce the accumulation of ethidium in the cell by excreting this cationic compound (Fig. 2 A). Also the C270A variant of LmrP is capable of limiting the accumulation of ethidium to lower levels than the control cells, indicating that the C270A mutant retained significant transport activity (Fig.2 A). Hoechst 33342 is highly fluorescent when it is present in the lipid environment of membranes but is essentially nonfluorescent in the aqueous phase. The transport of Hoechst 33342 from the membrane into the aqueous phase can therefore be followed in membrane vesicles by monitoring the Hoechst 33342 fluorescence over time. Upon the addition of ATP, which results in the formation of a proton motive force through proton pumping by the F1F0H+-ATPase, Hoechst 33342 was transported out of the membrane of inside-out membrane vesicles of L. lactis by LmrP as indicated by the decrease in Hoechst 33342 fluorescence (Fig.2 B). The Hoechst 33342 transport measurements further demonstrated that the C270A mutant retained significant transport activity (Fig. 2 B). In conclusion, the C270A mutant (referred to as “Cys-less LmrP”) is still capable of transporting multiple drugs and therefore provides a good starting point for generating mutant proteins with single cysteine replacements. Previous studies revealed that LmrP recognizes its lipophilic, cationic substrates within the membrane and not from the aqueous phase (10Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Brands J.R. Putman M. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24123-24128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that cationic drug-LmrP interaction involves electrostatic interactions with membrane-embedded, negatively charged residues. The distribution of the 19 acidic residues within the predicted topology model of LmrP is shown in Fig. 1. This topology model still awaits experimental confirmation, and therefore it is not known precisely which acidic residues are membrane-embedded. A cysteine scanning accessibility approach was used to identify the acidic residues located in the membrane domain of LmrP. For this, the codon of each acidic residue was mutated to that of cysteine. Inside-out membrane vesicles derived from cells expressing the single cysteine mutants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-His6 tag antibodies (data not shown). Of 19 mutants, 17 were expressed to approximately the same level as wild-type LmrP, suggesting that no major structural perturbation occurred upon substitution of any of these residues. Only one mutant, E166C, was not expressed, whereas mutant D340C was found at a low level in the membrane of L. lactis (data not shown). Hoechst 33342 transport measurements demonstrated that the single cysteine mutants can be divided into three groups based on their level of transport activity: (i) mutants that had essentially Cys-less LmrP transport activity: E133C, D198C, and E388C; (ii) mutants that had moderately reduced Hoechst 33342 transport activity: E3C, D8C, E199C, E202C, E255C, D286C, and E345C; and (iii) mutants that had strongly reduced Hoechst 33342 transport activity: D68C, D128C, D142C, E189C, D214C, D235C, and E327C (Table I).Table ITransport activities of cysteine mutants of LmrP for Hoechst 33342 in inside-out membrane vesiclesMutantInitial rate %E3C38D8C31D68C5D128C8E133C93D142C6E189C3D198C79E199C40E202C38D214C14D235C2E255C24D286C36E327C14E345C32E388C89For clarity of presentation activities are presented as initial rates of transport relative to the Cys-less LmrP (100%).

Open table in a new tab For clarity of presentation activities are presented as initial rates of transport relative to the Cys-less LmrP (100%). The initial rates were determined over the first 17 s after addition of 0.5 mm Mg2+-ATP. Also, the accumulation of ethidium was measured in cells expressing single cysteine mutants. Essentially Cys-less LmrP transport activity was found for mutants E3C, D8C, E133C, E189C, D198C, E199C, E202C, D214C, E255C, D286C, E345C, and E388C (data not shown). The D68C, D128C, D235C, and E327C mutants had all lost the ability to transport ethidium from the cell (Fig. 3). These four mutants have not only lost the transport activity but even seem to facilitate the influx of ethidium. Only one mutant, D142C, was more active then the Cys-less transporter. Evidence has been provided that cysteines in putative TMSs are inaccessible to the large, membrane-permeable thiol reagent fluorescein maleimide (18Meuller J. Rydström J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19072-19080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, cysteine residues that are modified by fluorescein maleimide must be exposed to the aqueous environment. Thus, fluorescein maleimide can be used to identify membrane-embedded residues in a membrane protein. Therefore, each single cysteine mutant was challenged with fluorescein maleimide in inside-out membrane vesicles. Subsequently, the vesicles were solubilized, and His6-tagged LmrP mutants were purified and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence of cysteine mutants labeled with fluorescein maleimide was detected by UV excitation. The cysteine-less mutant C270A, used as a negative control, was not modified by fluorescein maleimide (Fig.4). The single cysteine mutants E3C, D8C, D68C, D128C, E133C, E189C, D198C, E199C, E202C, D214C, D235C, E255C, D286C, and E345C were all labeled by fluorescein maleimide. The accessibility of these residues for fluorescein maleimide indicates a location in the protein structure that is well exposed to the aqueous environment and is consistent with a position in a loop structure. In contrast, the single cysteine mutants D142C, E327C, and E388C could not be labeled by fluorescein maleimide. Wild-type LmrP, harboring one native cysteine residue (Cys270), was also not labeled by fluorescein maleimide. These observations indicate that these four cysteine residues are either buried in the protein structure or exposed to the lipid environment. Thus, of the 19 negatively charged residues in LmrP, three acidic residues are located within the membrane domain of the transporter. The fluorescein maleimide labeling pattern of the single cysteine mutants is consistent with the previously proposed model for the membrane topology of LmrP (Fig. 1) (7Bolhuis H. Poelarends G. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26092-26098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The acidic residues at positions 142 (TMS V), 327 (TMS X), and 388 (TMS XII) thus appear to be located in the membrane domain of LmrP. To investigate in more detail whether the negative charges are important for drug transport activity of LmrP, each of these residues was replaced by other residues with (i) a conserved negative charge (mutants D142E, E327D, and E388D), (ii) a positive charge (mutants D142K, E327K, and E388K), or (iii) by a neutral residue (mutants D142A, E327A, and E388A). Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from cells expressing these mutants, and the amounts of mutant protein were determined by Western blotting using anti-His6 tag antibodies. All of the mutant proteins were expressed to levels similar to that of wild-type LmrP (data not shown). The functional properties of these mutants were studied by transport assays using the cationic substrates ethidium and Hoechst 33342. The acidic residues located in the loop regions of LmrP were not studied further, because these residues are probably not directly involved in drug binding. Replacing Asp142, Glu327, and Glu388 with the basic residue lysine almost completely abolished transport activity for both cationic substrates (Figs.5 and6). However, when the negative charge at these positions was preserved (mutants D142E, E327D, and E388D), transport of ethidium and Hoechst 33342 was not affected. Interestingly, mutants E388A (Figs. 5 and 6) and E388C (Table I and data not shown) retained Hoechst 33342 and ethidium transport activities comparable with those of the wild type. These results demonstrate that a negative charge at position 388 is not essential for transport nor for multidrug recognition. In contrast, the replacement of Asp142 and Glu327 with alanine or cysteine resulted in almost complete loss of Hoechst 33342 transport activity (Table I and Fig. 6), indicating that a negative charge at these positions is essential for transport of this divalent cationic drug. Surprisingly, mutants D142A and E327A retained significant transport activity for the monovalent cation ethidium (Fig. 5), whereas mutant D142C displayed an even higher ethidium transport activity then the Cys-less transporter (Fig. 3). Mutant E327C had lost the ability to transport ethidium from the cell (Fig. 3). The negative charges at positions 142 and 327 therefore appear to be essential for active transport of divalent negatively charged Hoechst 33342 but not for the monovalent ethidium. Thus, these residues dictate the multidrug transport character of LmrP.Figure 6Hoechst 33342 transport measurements with inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from cells expressing LmrP variants harboring mutations at positions of membrane-embedded negatively charged residues. Hoechst 33342 (1 μm) was added, and its binding to the membrane vesicles (0.5 mg of total protein/ml) was followed in time until a steady state was reached. Hoechst 33342 transport was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mm Mg-ATP. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because mutant D142C displayed a high ethidium transport activity, whereas mutant E327C lost the ability to transport ethidium, we tested whether the double cysteine mutant D142C/E327C could transport ethidium. This mutant was constructed and could be expressed in L. lactis as judged from Western blots using anti-His6 tag antibodies (Fig.7 A). Cells expressing the double cysteine mutant displayed a steady state ethidium accumulation level similar to that of nonexpressing control cells (Fig.7 B). As expected, this mutant protein also did not exhibit significant Hoechst 33342 transport activity (Fig. 7 C). Taken together, these results provide further support for the finding that the negative charges at positions 142 and 327 in LmrP play critical roles in transport of lipophilic cationic compounds. Our results indicated that the cysteines introduced at positions 142 and 327 are not accessible to fluorescein maleimide and thus are likely to be located in the membrane-embedded domain of LmrP. Interestingly, the solvent accessibility of these cysteines was found to be increased upon binding of substrate by LmrP (Fig. 8). For mutant D142C, the efficiency of labeling by fluorescein maleimide was strongly increased upon preincubation with Hoechst 33342. Surprisingly, preincubation with ethidium did not result in an increased accessibility to fluorescein maleimide. The opposite behavior was found for mutant E327C (Fig. 8). Preincubation with Hoechst 33342 did not result in an increased labeling efficiency, but exposure to ethidium resulted in an increased accessibility of the cysteine at position 327 to fluorescein maleimide. An increase in fluorescein maleimide labeling efficiency upon incubation with substrates was not observed for the wild-type protein and mutant E388C, both of which contain a membrane-embedded cysteine, nor for mutant D198C, which contains a solvent-accessible cysteine (Fig. 8). To our surprise, the double cysteine mutant, which is transport inactive, displayed an increased fluorescein maleimide labeling efficiency in the presence of both ethidium (1 mm) and Hoechst 33342 (0.2 mm) (Fig. 8), indicating that this mutant protein can still interact with substrates. However, because high substrate concentrations were used in these experiments, we repeated the labeling experiments in the presence of low concentrations of drugs. As shown in Fig. 9, efficient labeling of D142C already occurs at 10 μm of Hoechst 33342, whereas 200 μm of Hoechst 33342 is necessary to obtain efficient labeling of mutant D142C/E327C. This suggests that mutant D142C has a higher affinity for Hoechst 33342 than the double cysteine mutant. Labeling of mutants E327C and D142C/E327C takes place only at ethidium concentrations higher than 50 μm, which suggests that both mutants have low affinity for this substrate. Transport of cationic substrates Hoechst 33342 and ethidium was studied in inside-out membrane vesicles and cells of L. lactis expressing wild type and mutants of LmrP. Mutants of LmrP were obtained by systematic replacement of the acidic residues in a cysteine-less mutant C270A by cysteine. In these experiments the residues Asp68, Asp128, Asp235, and Glu327 (summary in Table II) were identified to be critical for transport function of LmrP. Cysteine scanning accessibility experiments revealed that three acidic residues (Fig. 4) Asp142, Glu327, and Glu388are located in the membrane-embedded domain of LmrP. These predictions are consistent with the presented membrane topology of LmrP (Fig.1).Table IISummary of transport activities of cysteine mutants of LmrP for ethidium and Hoechst 33342MutantTransport activityEthidiumHoechst 33342Wild type++++++C270A+++E3C++D8C++D68C−i−D128C−i−E133C+++D142C++−E189C+−D198C+++E199C++E202C++D214C+−D235C−i−E255C++D286C++E327C−i−E345C++E388C+++D142C/E327C−−+++, wild-type LmrP transport activity; −, lack of transport activity, as observed for LmrP nonexpressing cells and membrane vesicles; i, mutants the expression of which results in increased influx of ethidium into cells under energized conditions.

Because the lactococcal multidrug transporter LmrP recognizes its lipophilic cationic substrates within the membrane (10Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Brands J.R. Putman M. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M.

Therefore, we have focused on the drug recognition properties of LmrP by analyzing the consequences of substitutions of the negatively charged residues at positions 142, 327, and 388 (TableIII). Membrane-embedded acidic residues in multidrug transporters (4Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Edgar R. Bibi E.

Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) have been found to be important for transport and/or binding of lipophilic cations. Introduction of neutral or negatively charged residues at position 388 in LmrP had no influence on the transport of the lipophilic cations ethidium and Hoechst 33342. Only when a positively charged residue was introduced, was the transport activity abolished. In contrast, mutations at positions 142 and 327 had drastic effects on drug transport. The most important outcome of our experiments is that the negative charges at positions 142 and 327 are essential only for the transport of the divalent cation Hoechst 33342. In principle, this could reflect the possibility that these residues play a critical role in energy utilization and coupling or that their replacement may have caused detrimental structural modifications. These possibilities seem unlikely, however, because mutants 142A/C and 327A transport the monovalent cation ethidium quite efficiently. Hence, the mutations at positions 142 and 327 alter the drug specificity pattern by exerting a differential effect on the transport of monovalent and divalent cations.Table IIITransport activities of LmrP mutants of membrane embedded negatively charged residuesMutantTransport activityEthidiumHoechst 33342Wild type++++++D142E++++++D142A+−D142K−−E327D++++++E327A++−E327K+−E388D++++++E388A++++++E388K−−+++, WT LmrP transport activity; −, lack of transport activity, as observed for LmrP nonexpressing cells and membrane vesicles.

Koole L.A. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13900-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) indicated the presence of multiple substrate-binding sites in LmrP. Because of overlapping fluorescence spectra, it was unfortunately not possible to determine whether ethidium inhibits Hoechst 33342 transport competitively, noncompetitively, or uncompetitively. The possibility that Hoechst 33342 binds to another binding site than ethidium has to be considered. The results of labeling experiments of cysteine mutants with fluorescein maleimide in the presence of substrates indeed suggest such a possibility. The cysteine at position 142 was labeled by fluorescein maleimide in the presence of Hoechst 33342 but not in the presence of ethidium. The high transport activity of mutant D142C for ethidium demonstrates that this mutant must interact with this monovalent cation. The opposite phenomenon was observed for mutant E327C, which was labeled in the presence of ethidium but not in the presence of Hoechst 33342. Surprisingly, increased labeling by fluorescein maleimide showed that the double cysteine mutant D142C/E327C interacts both with ethidium and Hoechst 33342. These observations, together with the substrate concentration dependence of labeling, demonstrate that residues Asp142 and Glu327 are not essential for binding of these cationic drugs but increase the affinity of LmrP for substrates. Probably other residues in the binding pocket,i.e. those containing aliphatic side chains or aromatic rings, supply hydrophobic interactions that are sufficient to allow substrate binding with low affinity. The lack of protection of cysteine residues by substrates against labeling by fluorescein maleimide may suggest that these residues are in a location distant to the bound substrate. On the other hand, the possibility that each of the two substrates protects only one of the two cysteines (ethidium, D142C; Hoechst 33342, E327C) against labeling by fluorescein maleimide cannot be excluded. Paulsen et al. (4Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described a very similar charge-related phenomenon with the multidrug resistance proteins QacA and QacB fromStaphylococcus aureus. These closely related multidrug efflux pumps both confer resistance to various organic cations. However, QacB mediates significantly lower levels of resistance to divalent cations than QacA. The authors observed that the presence of an acidic residue at position 323 within putative TMS X of the QacA protein plays a critical role in conveying high level resistance to divalent organic cations. Additionally, it was demonstrated that QacB mutants containing an acidic residue at position 322 were also able to confer resistance to divalent cations. Hence, it was proposed that the region of the QacA/B protein containing the essential acidic residue plays a role in recognition or binding of divalent cations. The importance of negatively charged residues for recognition of cationic drugs was clearly demonstrated in a recent structural study of the S. aureus multidrug-binding protein QacR (23Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This regulatory protein represses transcription of the qacA gene and is induced by structurally diverse cationic lipophilic drugs. Schumacher et al. (23Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) reported the crystal structures of six QacR-drug complexes. The combined structures revealed that QacR contains several separate but linked binding sites within one extended drug-binding pocket, which contains four negatively charged residues (e.g. glutamates) that neutralize the positive charges on the structurally distinct drug molecules. The results of our studies suggest that the acidic residues at positions 142 and 327 in LmrP are involved in a drug-binding pocket, which may consist of multiple drug interaction sites to account for the multidrug transport character of LmrP. The observation that introduced cysteines at positions 142 and 327 could not be labeled by fluorescein maleimide suggests a hydrophobic nature for this pocket. An important outcome of the fluorescein maleimide labeling studies is the observation that upon interaction with substrates, the membrane-embedded residues Cys142 and Cys327 move from a solvent-inaccessible to a solvent-exposed environment. This movement may be related to a translocation of these residues from a hydrophobic substrate-binding site to a hydrophilic substrate translocation pathway, which is in agreement with the for LmrP proposed “hydrophobic vacuum cleaner” model of drug transport (10Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Brands J.R. Putman M. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24123-24128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whereas the presence of one negative charge in the multidrug-binding pocket may be sufficient for the recognition of the monovalent cation ethidium by LmrP, the recognition of the divalent cation Hoechst 33342 clearly depends on the presence of both negative charges. Possibly, each of these negative charges interacts directly with one of the positively charged moieties of the divalent cation. Interestingly QacA seems to contain several acidic residues within its putative membrane-embedded domain (4Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It would be interesting to investigate whether more than one negatively charged residue plays a role in the recognition of divalent cations. Ethidium accumulation in glucose-energized L. lactis cells expressing the LmrP mutants D68C, D128C, D235C, and E327C was faster then in control cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that these mutant proteins facilitate ethidium influx into the cell. Because all of these mutants appear to be (almost completely) inactive with regard to extrusion of ethidium and Hoechst 33342, it is possible that these residues play important roles in active transport and coupling. Cysteine scanning accessibility experiments revealed that residues Asp68, Asp128, and Asp235 are located in loop regions (Fig. 1), which makes a direct interaction of these residues with substrates very unlikely. Another possible explanation could be that the conformation of LmrP is affected by these mutations, resulting in a change of gating mechanism, allowing the influx of ethidium through the translocation pathway. Interestingly, residue Asp68 is part of a conserved motif, GXXXDRXGRK, located in the cytoplasmic loop between TMSs II and III of the major facilitator superfamily transporters (24Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 124: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On the basis of mutagenesis of the TetA(B) tetracycline transporter, it has been proposed that this motif may be involved in the reversible conformational change required for opening and/or closing of the substrate translocation pathway (25Yamagutchi A. Ono N. Akasaka T. Noumi T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15525-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Someya et al. (26Someya Y. Kimura-Someya T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 210-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) indicated that Arg70 in TetA(B), which is also located in this conserved motif, requires the negative charge of Asp120, corresponding to Asp128 in LmrP, for proper positioning of transmembrane segments in the membrane. Taken together, these observations suggest that residues Asp68, Asp128, Asp235, and possibly Glu327(also implicated in substrate binding) might be part of the structural framework responsible for gating the translocation pathway of LmrP. Further mutagenesis studies are required to investigate this possibility. In summary, the results of this study showed that a number of acidic residues are important for LmrP-mediated transport of lipophilic cationic compounds. The residues Asp68, Asp128, and Asp235 are located in putative loop regions of the protein and are probably not involved in direct interactions with drugs. Further studies must be done to determine the exact role of these residues in the function of LmrP. The other critical residues Asp142 and Glu327 are located at the intracellular side of the TMSs V and X, respectively, consistent with the fact that LmrP extrudes drugs from the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer (10Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W.

Based on the kinetics of transport-competition experiments, Putman et al. (11Putman M. Koole L.A. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13900-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) proposed the presence of at least two drug interaction sites in LmrP, which may represent distinct drug-binding sites on the protein or may represent drug-binding regions within a common hydrophobic binding pocket. We favor the hypothesis that the acidic residues Asp142 and Glu327 are part of a common hydrophobic multidrug-binding pocket, in which both charges are essential for the recognition site of divalent cations such as Hoechst 33342."
https://openalex.org/W2094025915,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase anchoring protein, d-AKAP1, has two N-terminal splice variants. The shorter forms (N0, d-AKAP1a, and -1c) target to mitochondria, and the longer forms (N1, d-AKAP1b, and -1d) with 33 additional residues N-terminal to N0 target to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Huang, L. J., Wang, L., Ma, Y., Durick, K., Perkins, G., Deerinck, T. J., Ellisman, M. H., and Taylor, S. S. (1999) J. Cell Biol. 145, 951–959). In d-AKAP1a, translation may initiate from both Met-34 or Met-49 producing two molecules both targeted to mitochondria. The shorter molecule contains the 15-residue targeting motif, homologous to the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting motif of hexokinase I. Extensive mutagenesis showed that one hydrophobic surface of the 15-residue hexokinase-homologous segment contained the key elements for mitochondrial targeting. The same 15 residues are also part of the ER-targeting signal, but for ER targeting multiple hydrophobic residues are required that encompass both surfaces of the helix. The different involvement of the same helical motif for targeting to the two organelles appears to reflect different modes of interaction with the two organelles. This is the first example of a bifunctional helical element that is required for both ER and mitochondrion targeting.

It plays an important role in many cell functions such as energy production, metabolism, ion channel activities, motility, transcription, differentiation, and signal transduction (1Edelman A.M.

The activity of PKA is controlled by the R subunit in response to cAMP. With an increase of cAMP and its subsequent binding to the R subunits, the C subunit is unleashed from the R subunit and can phosphorylate its nearby substrates. Substrate recognition for PKA requires the presence of two arginines at the P −2 and P −3 sites and a hydrophobic residue at the P +1 site where the P site corresponds to the Ser or Thr to be phosphorylated (3Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 429-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 7Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Because the stringency for substrate is low, subcellular compartmentation of PKA is considered to play an important role in specific cellular regulation (8Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). With a local enrichment of PKA, phosphorylation may be limited to substrate(s) in the vicinity of the anchoring site. Specific subcellular localization of PKA is achieved through the binding of R subunits to a class of scaffold proteins termed A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Depending on the targeting domain or motif an AKAP carries, it can bring PKA to different subcellular locations such as the nucleus, plasma membrane, ER, Golgi, mitochondria, microtubules, etc. and can mediate different cAMP signaling events (9Dell'Acqua M.L.

Mammalian cells express multiple forms of R and C subunits that assemble to form different holoenzyme isoforms. There are two general classes of R subunits (RI or RII) that form the corresponding holoenzymes, PKAI and PKAII, respectively, and these are differentially distributed in mammalian tissues. RI is predominant in growing and tumor cells, whereas RII is largely expressed in differentiated cells (13Cho-Chung Y.S. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7093-7100PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tortora G. Yokozaki H. Pepe S. Clair T. Cho-Chung Y.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The R subunits also differ in their regulation and biochemical properties. RI has a higher affinity for cAMP than RII, so that PKAI is activated transiently by a weak cAMP signal. In contrast, PKAII responds to high and persistent cAMP stimulation (15Doskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Tasken K. Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K.A. Solberg R. Knutsen H.K. Levy F.O. Sandberg M. Orstavik S. Larsen T. Johansen A.K. Vang T. Schrader H.P. Reinton N.T. Torgersen K.M. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 191-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the AKAPs bind to RII. A few bind to both RI and RII, and two have been identified that specifically bind only to RI (12Feliciello A. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 17Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because the AKAPs can also bind to other regulatory proteins such as protein kinase C, calcineurin, AMY-1, PP1, and PDE2, they very likely play a role in the integration of complex signaling networks (11Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 18Steen R.L. Martins S.B. Tasken K. Collas P. J.

Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition to binding both PKA-I and PKA-II, different splice variants ofd-AKAP1 can localize to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria, indicating that this protein is probably a multipurpose regulator in cell signaling (8Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 21Scott J.D. Dell'Acqua M.L. Fraser I.D. Tavalin S.J. Lester L.B. Adv.

They vary at the N terminus and/or the C terminus, with the dual-specific R binding domain located within the common core in the center of the molecule. It has been shown that AKAP149 is involved in nuclear lamina assembly and may play an important role in mitosis (18Steen R.L. Martins S.B. Tasken K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Steen R.L. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The targeting domain ofd-AKAP1 is located at the N terminus (20Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 23Chen Q. Lin R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Molecules bearing a shorter N terminus (d-AKAP1a and -1c) target to mitochondria, whereas those bearing 33 additional residues (N1) at the N terminus (d-AKAP1b and -1d) target to ER (27Huang L.J. Wang L., Ma, Y. Durick K. Perkins G. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial targeting motif is also part of the ER-targeting element and therefore may be involved in both mitochondria and ER targeting (27Huang L.J. Wang L., Ma, Y. Durick K. Perkins G. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because 15 residues in this motif are homologous to the mitochondrial targeting sequence of hexokinase I (27Huang L.J. Wang L., Ma, Y. Durick K. Perkins G. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 28Mulichak A.M. Wilson J.E. Padmanabhan K. Garavito R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), these two molecules may likely use a similar mechanism to target to mitochondria. Hexokinase is a well known mitochondrial outer membrane-binding protein that participates in the regulation of glycolysis and ATP production. It binds porin as part of the regulation of ATP export from mitochondria. The targeting to mitochondria is reversible in response to the cellular level of Glu-6-P (29Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 126: 65-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A comparative study of d-AKAP1 and hexokinase I is, therefore, a good prototype for understanding the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial targeting. In addition, the comparison provides a tool to study the relationship between a mitochondrial targeting motif and an ER-targeting signal. The anchoring of PKA on both mitochondria and ER implies that PKA may be involved in the general cellular metabolism related to these two organelles, such as energy production, protein synthesis, Ca2+ signaling, or apoptosis. To understand the role of PKA anchoring on these two organelles and how the anchoring is regulated, we explored the molecular basis for d-AKAP1 binding to mitochondria and ER. Extensive mutagenesis showed that one hydrophobic surface of the 15-residue hexokinase-homologous segment contained the key elements for mitochondrial targeting. The same 15 residues are also part of the ER-targeting signal, but multiple hydrophobic residues are required that encompass both surfaces of the helix. We propose that the 15-residue motif in the mitochondrial targeting domain is bifunctional and is required for both ER and mitochondrion targeting. For studying the N terminus ofd-AKAP1, full-length d-AKAP1a and -b were subcloned into pCMV-Sport1 (Invitrogen) at EcoRI andXhoI sites. For easier detection, a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was added to the C terminus by using the inverted PCR method for all the constructs with half of the tag incorporated in each of the primers (30Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). For detecting initiation of translation, the N-terminal fragments up to residue 175 of d-AKAP1 were subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) between EcoRI and XhoI sites with PCR and translated with a quick-coupled T7 TnT system (Promega). To identify the minimal targeting motif, the N-terminal sequences ending at position 60 or 63 were inserted betweenEcoRI and BamHI sites in pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). The amino acid numbering ofd-AKAP1 corresponds to the full length ofd-AKAP1b, where the first residue is number 1. Consequently, d-AKAP1a starts with amino acid 34. The hexokinase I (N-terminal half) cDNA and GFP fusion constructs (31Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. John Wilson (Michigan State University). GFP fusion construct mtGFP (32Rizzuto R. Brini M., De Giorgi F. Rossi R. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 183-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), which contains 31 residues of the precursor of subunit VIII of cytochrome c oxidase N-terminal to the yellow fluorescent protein (33Rizzuto R. Brini M. Pizzo P. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 635-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. R. Y. Tsien (University of California, San Diego) and was used as a mitochondrial marker. The ER-targeting construct, ER-GFP (34Pestov D.G. Polonskaia M. Lau L.F. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which contains the first transmembrane domain of the human lamin B receptor (residues 206–254) N-terminal to enhanced GFP, was a gift from Dr. D. G. Pestov (University of Illinois) and was used as an ER marker. Most of the mutations in the targeting domain of d-AKAP1 shown in Fig. 2 were made using the Kunkel method (35Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). A few difficult mutants were made using a modified quick-change method (36Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) with one primer in a 10-μl reaction. Other point mutations were made using an inverted PCR method (30Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), with the mutations incorporated into one of the primers. Thed-AKAP1-hexokinase domain swap constructs were made with a mega-primer method (37Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar), followed by the standard molecular cloning protocols (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides GTAGTTGCGCGGCGATCAGTCCGGGCAACGCCAAGG and TTTTGACTTGGTCATCCTTTTTACGAGAGAAAAACC were used together with a primer near residue 20 of d-AKAP1 (TAGGATCCGGAGGTGTAGC) to make mega-primers to merge d-AKAP1 and hexokinase at residues 49 or 63, respectively. Oligonucleotides CTGCTGCTGAGCCGATCCTTCAGCTCGGTGAAGT together with a primer (GGGAGGTGTATATAAGCAGAGCT) in the cytomegalovirus promoter make mega-primers that fuse the N terminus of hexokinase I tod-AKAP1 sequences. A common second primer at the C-terminal FLAG tag for d-AKAP1 (CTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTC) or end of GFP for hexokinase (AGAGTCGCGGCCGCTT) was used in combination with the mega-primer to make the final fusion product with d-AKAP1 or hexokinase, respectively. The insertion of hexokinase I sequences into d-AKAP1b was made by inverted PCR. Half of the coding sequences of hexokinase sequences were included in each primer pair, CTTCAGCTCGGTGAAGTAATAGG and ATGCTGGCCCTCCTTGGCTGG for hexokinase-d-AKAP1 junction, and TTTTTTACGAGAGAAAAACCACCAC and ATGATCGCCGCGCAACTACTG for d-AKAP1-hexokinase junction, in the inverted PCRs. The PCR products were then circularized with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature before transforming DH5α cells. The partial fusion constructs of hexokinase I-d-AKAP1 were made by deleting 15 different residues from the insertion constructs with inverted PCR, resulting in fusion proteins with different junction points. Microinjection of DNA was done as described previously (39Ma Y. Prigent S.A. Born T.L. Monell C.R. Feramisco J.R. Bertolaet B.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5341-5348PubMed Google Scholar). DNA samples were prepared with a midiprep kit (Qiagen) and diluted to 10 μg/ml in H2O before injection. Transfection was done with either Superfect (Qiagen) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to Ma and Feramisco. 2Y. Ma and J. R. Feramisco, unpublished data. Basically, 10T1/2 cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum in a 6-cm dish containing 12 pieces of 1-mm round cover slips (Fisher) to get 60–70% confluency. The cover slips were then transferred to a 24-well dish for transfection. DNA samples were prepared with Quantumprep mini-kit (Bio-Rad) from an overnight culture. Cotransfection was done by mixing several kinds of DNA species at different ratios, adjusted to the same amount with DNA from the blank vectors. The amounts of DNA and transfection agents were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Staining was done as described earlier (39Ma Y. Prigent S.A. Born T.L. Monell C.R. Feramisco J.R. Bertolaet B.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5341-5348PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Approximately 6–7 h after injection or transfection, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed at room temperature for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5. The cells on cover slips were then permeabilized with 3% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature and incubated with 30 μl of diluted antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h. An antibody against the C-terminal FLAG tag (40Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar) was used to detect mitochondrial targeting of d-AKAP1, and an antibody against the N-terminal 33 residues (20Huang L.J.

All the antibodies were diluted in a solution containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against d-AKAP1 (N1 and RPP7) were used at a 1:100 dilution as described (20Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

All the other unspecified secondary antibodies with rhodamine or fluorescein conjugates were from The Jackson Laboratory and were used in a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The cells were examined and photographed with a Leica Axiophot microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu chilled 3CCD camera. d-AKAP1 with two alternative splicing forms at the N terminus was able to encode for two isoforms that target to ER and mitochondria, respectively (20Huang L.J.

As diagrammed in Fig.1, there are three codons for methionine within the 63-residue targeting domain at positions 1, 34, and 49, respectively. All of these initiation codons are located in the near-optimal consensus for eukaryotic initiation of translation and can therefore be potential initiation sites (41Kozak M. J. Mol.

However, initiation from Met-49 would produce a shorter molecule, denoted d-AKAP1− (49), with only 15 residues in the targeting domain. Because there was no antibody available to distinguish between the small differences in the N terminus ofd-AKAP1a, we substituted the second initiation codons with CTG in the mutant M49L, or we deleted the first 15 residues in mutant Δ1–48 (producing d-AKAP1− (49)), which would allow initiation from only one of the methionines. To determine whether both initiation codons are used in d-AKAP1, we subcloned the N-terminal fragment of d-AKAP1a (up to residues 175), and we examined the peptides produced in an in vitro translation assay. As shown in Fig. 1C, d-AKAP1a can produce two products corresponding to initiation from residues 34 and 49, respectively. As controls, M49L and Δ1–48 each produce only one band, corresponding to initiation at Met-34 or Met-49. This way of generating two overlapping peptides from a single mRNA could be mediated by leaky-scanning initiation of translation (42Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). Therefore, translation would be another mechanism, in addition to splicing, to generate isoform diversity for of d-AKAP1 with multiple N termini. It is not surprising to see that Δ1–48, with only 15 residues in the targeting domain, is able to target to mitochondria with a pattern similar to mtGFP (Fig.2A), because these 15 hydrophobic residues (49–63) are highly homologous to the N-terminal 15-residue mitochondrial targeting domain of hexokinase I (Fig.1B) (20Huang L.J.

Probably because of outer mitochondrial membrane targeting, d-AKAP1 with either a 15- or 30-residue targeting domain is more intense near the nucleus, in contrast to the lumen targeting mtGFP that is distributed relatively evenly in the cell (Fig. 2A, a–f). d-AKAP1 and hexokinase I all have positively charged residues C-terminal to the hydrophobic stretch in the targeting domain, characteristic of mitochondrial outer membrane-binding proteins (43Steenaart N.A. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3764-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 44Xie G.C. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem.

Removal of these charged residues, residues 49–60, leads to loss of mitochondrial targeting in a GFP fusion construct (Fig. 2A). The hexokinase targeting domain adopts an amphipathic helix structure and is considered to lie on top of the lipid bilayer and then insert into the mitochondrial outer membrane (28Mulichak A.M. Wilson J.E. Padmanabhan K. Garavito R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Wilson J.E. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

This mitochondrial targeting domain in hexokinase is necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting (31Sui D. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 46Gelb B.D. Adams V. Jones S.N. Griffin L.D. MacGregor G.R. McCabe E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To see whether the corresponding 15 residues in d-AKAP1 are also sufficient for targeting to mitochondria, we performed several domain-swap experiments, exchanging these 15 residues between d-AKAP1 and hexokinase I, and we also fused the 15-residue minimal motif to GFP. This “minimal” motif can bring either the hexokinase I or the GFP fusion protein to mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Residues 34–48 are not required for mitochondrial targeting. Placing these residues N-terminal to the hexokinase sequences also has no effect on mitochondrial targeting (Fig. 2A). Therefore, it is apparent that the 15-residue mitochondrial targeting motifs from hexokinase I andd-AKAP1a each contain all the elements needed for targeting and are mutually exchangeable for binding to mitochondria. To determine the mechanism ford-AKAP1a targeting to mitochondria, we performed single amino acid scanning mutagenesis as follows: changing residues 37–39 to Ala; changing every residue between positions 40 and 60 to the neutral polar residue Asn; and the basic residues in 61–63 to Glu (Fig.2B). Because the mutation M49L in d-AKAP1a does not affect mitochondrial targeting (Fig. 2A), all the mutations at positions 34–48 were made in the M49L mutant to avoid interference by the mitochondrial targeting products initiated from Met-49 (Fig. 1). As summarized in the left panel of Fig.2B, none of the single-site mutations disrupted mitochondrial targeting, as indicated with a red bar below each affected residue. To make a larger perturbation, we substituted three consecutive residues to Ala, Asn, or Glu in the same region as the single-residue mutations. Just like sub-(46–49) and sub-(52–54), examples shown on the right panel of Fig. 2B, the triple Asn mutations between positions 46 and 57 (in the center of the hydrophobic stretch) abolished mitochondrial targeting and generated a punctate pattern over a diffused background. The involved residues are marked with open squares in the left panel of Fig. 2B. These data suggest that the degree of hydrophobicity in a 12-residue region is necessary for mitochondrial targeting, but no single amino acid is critical. The effects of other mutations are also summarized in the left panel of Fig. 2B. As exemplified by sub-(43–45) shown on the right panel, mutations at residues 37–45 have no effect on mitochondrial targeting, and this agrees with the finding that residues 49–63 are sufficient for mitochondrial targeting (Fig.2A). On the other hand, although residues 46–48 are not within the minimal domain (residues 49–63), these residues cannot tolerate a triple Asn substitution. Probably the three foreign asparagines reduced the net hydrophobicity of the targeting domain. Mutations at residues 58–60 also had no effect on targeting, probably because they are located outside the hydrophobic core. Surprisingly, mutation of residues 61–63 that removes the three positively charged residues also does not affect mitochondrial targeting. Most likely the Arg-65 immediately to the C terminus provides the positive charge required to cooperate with the central hydrophobic residues for mitochondrial targeting. Because the mitochondrial targeting motif is also needed for ER targeting in d-AKAP1b, it is important to determine what role this motif plays in ER targeting. For this purpose we converted the single- and triple-residue scanning mutations intod-AKAP1b, and we tested their effect on ER targeting using an antibody against N1. We also mutated residues 34–36 to Asn to cover the junction. As summarized in Fig. 2C, all the triple-residue mutations that abolished mitochondrial targeting ind-AKAP1a also abolish ER targeting and lead to a diffused pattern, as shown with open boxes below the affected residues. In addition, the region that is sensitive to triple-residue substitution was expanded back to residue 40 and spans 18 residues in d-AKAP1b. The polar residue-rich region of N1 that precedes the hydrophobic core may have reduced the general hydrophobicity of the"

In addition, azurocidin is an inactive serine protease homolog with binding sites for diverse ligands including heparin and the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). The structure of the protein reveals a highly cationic domain concentrated on one side of the molecule and responsible for its strong polarity. To investigate the role of this highly basic region, we produced three recombinant azurocidin mutant proteins that were altered in either one or both of two clusters of 4 basic residues located symmetrically on each side of a central cleft in the cationic domain. Two of the mutant proteins (Loop 3: R5Q, K6Q, R8Q, and R10Q; Loop 4: R61Q, R62Q, R63Q, and R65Q) exhibited little or no change in heparin and BPTI binding or in antimicrobial function. In contrast, the Loop 3/Loop 4 mutant (R5Q, K6Q, R8Q, R10Q, R61Q, R62Q, R63Q, and R65Q) in which all 8 basic residues were replaced showed greatly decreased ability to bind heparin and to kill Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. Thus, we report that the 8 basic residues that were altered in the Loop 3/Loop 4 mutant contribute to the ability of the wild-type azurocidin molecule to bind heparin and to kill E. coli and C. albicans. Because BPTI binding was comparable in wild-type and Loop 3/Loop 4 mutant protein, we conclude that the same 8 basic residues are not involved in the binding of BPTI to azurocidin, supporting the notion that the binding site for BPTI is distinct from the site involved in heparin binding and antimicrobial activity. Finally, we show that removal of all 4 positively charged amino acids in the 20–44 azurocidin sequence (DMC1: R23Q,H24S,H32S,R34Q), a region previously thought to contain an antimicrobial domain, does not affect the activity of the protein against E. coli, Streptococcus faecalis, andC. albicans.

The mechanism for these functions is largely unknown. Structurally, azurocidin belongs to the serprocidin family, a group of serine proteases with antimicrobial function but lacking enzymatic activity (13Campanelli D. Detmers P.A. Nathan C.F. Gabay J.E.

Its three-dimensional structure has been elucidated and shows a highly cationic region made of 16 basic amino acid residues and located at one pole of the molecule (17Iversen L.F. Kastrup J.S.

In addition to its high density of positive charges, the cationic region also contains potential heparin binding consensus sequences that are located in loop areas of azurocidin tertiary structure (4Flodgaard H.

Several ligands have been shown to bind to azurocidin, including heparin and the serine protease inhibitor BPTI1 (4Flodgaard H. Ostergaard E. Bayne S. Svendsen A. Thomsen J. Engels M. Wollmer A. Eur.

In this report, we show that heparin and BPTI bind to distinct regions of the molecule and that these two ligands differentially affect antimicrobial activity. Indeed, binding of heparin but not of BPTI inhibits antimicrobial activity. To probe the role of the cationic region in both heparin binding and antimicrobial activity, we mutated the basic residues found in two loops of the azurocidin molecule, and we purified the wild-type and mutant proteins following expression in the baculovirus insect cell system (20Almeida R.P. Vanet A. Witko-Sarsat V. Melchior M. McCabe D. Gabay J.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this paper, we examine the abilities of recombinant wild-type and mutant azurocidin to bind to ligands and to kill microorganisms. Heparin-agarose ((500 μg/ml), heparin (averageMr 18,000), and low molecular weight heparin (LMW-heparin; average mass 3000 Da) from porcine intestinal mucosa, low electroendosmosis-agarose, and goat anti-rabbit antibody were obtained from Sigma. Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. CFSE was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and Sephadex G-25 NaP 10-ml columns were obtained from Amersham Biosciences and The UpJohn Co. Cell lines Sf9 and High5, baculovirus linear DNA, and cationic liposomes were purchased from Invitrogen. SF900-II and fetal calf serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Quartz cuvettes were purchased from Hellma Cells, Inc. (Forest Hills, NY). AB2 luminescence fluorimeter and support software were purchased from Spectronic Instruments (Rochester, NY), and spectropolarimeter was from Jasco Inc. (Easton, MD). C4 Vydac column was purchased from Vydac (St. Hesperia, CA). Square Petri dishes 100 × 100 × 15 mm were obtained from VWR Scientific (West Chester, PA). 7× Measuring Magnifier was obtained from Bausch & Lomb (Rochester, NY). Vent polymerase, restriction enzymes, and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Primers were purchased from Invitrogen. dNTPs and reaction buffers for PCR were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. pBluescript II KS was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and plasmids pAcC4 and pUC18 were gifts (Dr. R. Stevens, Frederick, MD, and Dr. G. Segal, Tel Aviv, Israel). All other chemicals were reagent grade. Insect cell supernatants containing wild-type or mutant were collected 4 days post-infection with recombinant baculovirus, as described (20Almeida R.P. Vanet A. Witko-Sarsat V. Melchior M. McCabe D. Gabay J.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Wild-type and DMC1 rAzu supernatants were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.1 mNaCl, passed onto a heparin-agarose column, and eluted with a 0.1–2m NaCl gradient as described. The Loop Mutant rAzu supernatants were purified similarly except that NaCl was omitted from both the dialysis buffer and the heparin-binding buffer. Following elution, fractions of 2 ml were collected and tested by silver stain and Western blot. Fractions containing rAzu were pooled and subjected to rpHPLC. All protein stocks were dissolved in 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5. The yields were ∼2–3 mg of protein per 600 ml of insect cell culture supernatants. Fast protein liquid chromatography of wild-type and mutant rAzu proteins was performed as follows. Insect cell culture supernatants (2 ml) containing wild-type or mutant rAzu or purified rAzu proteins were injected onto a 1-ml HiTrap™ Heparin HP column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a gradient of 0–2 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Protein peaks were monitored by absorption at 280 nm. For BPTI affinity chromatography, BPTI was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B as per manufacturer's protocol, and the insect cell supernatant containing wild-type rAzu was passed onto the BPTI-Sepharose column, using the conditions described previously for nAzu (19Petersen L.C. Birktoft J.J. Flodgaard H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, insect cell supernatant containing rAzu was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-OH buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.8 m NaCl and passed onto the BPTI-Sepharose column (30 mg ligand/ml gel), washed with 50 mm Tris-OH buffer, pH 8.0, and eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and analyzed by silver stain and Western blot. rAzu intrinsic fluorescence (5 μm) was monitored using excitation at 280 nm and emission spectrum in the 290–350 nm range. The changes in rAzu fluorescence spectrum observed upon addition of LMW-heparin (0.1–10 μm) were measured at the peak of emission (330 nm). Percent change in fluorescence observed in the presence of heparin was subtracted from percent change in fluorescence due to volume alone (ΔF − ΔFo/ΔFo ×100) and plotted against heparin concentration. To determine the binding constant of rAzu-heparin interaction, we used a Hill plot representation and the equation, n log[S]0.5 = logKd, where n is the number of binding sites and [S]0.5 represents the heparin concentration at which half-maximal binding occurred. BPTI (1 mg/ml) was labeled with succinimidyl ester CFSE (100 μg/ml) by adding 100 μl of a 10-fold concentrated CFSE inN,N-dimethylformamide to 900 μl of BPTI in PBS. The mixture was rotated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark and then immediately passed onto a gel filtration column (Sephadex G-25 Nap) to separate CFSE-labeled BPTI from free CFSE. Fractions of 0.25 ml were collected and monitored using an absorbance of 490 nm. Fractions that comigrated with BPTI alone (absorbance at 280 nm), but not with CFSE alone (absorbance at 490 nm), were pooled and repurified by the same method. Maximum free CFSE in the BPTI-CFSE pool was measured to be no greater than 1.3%. The BPTI-CFSE was then separated by rpHPLC using a C4 Vydac column, and the dominant peaks were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify the fluoresceinated species obtained. Peak A had a mass of 6872 Da equivalent to 1BPTI:1CFSE and peak B a mass of 7230 Da equivalent to 1BPTI:2CFSE. Because the individual peaks separated by rpHPLC were inactive with respect to binding rAzu (data not shown), the pool containing both the 1BPTI:1CFSE and the 1BPTI:2CFSE mixtures was used. Binding of CFSE-labeled BPTI to rAzu was measured using the retention method (21Silhavy T.J. Szmelcman S. Boos W. Schwartz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Briefly, dialysis membranes of 10,000 Mr cut-off were filled with 200 μl of a solution containing BPTI-CFSE and either PBS buffer alone or rAzu in PBS. The membranes were then placed in 200 ml of buffer, with stirring, at room temperature. Samples of 20 μl were withdrawn from dialysis bags at specific times of incubation, 2 ml of PBS added, and the fluorescence measured (excitation, 490 nm; emission, 518 nm). The Kd was calculated through use of the equation t12(+rAzu)/t12(−rAzu) = 1 + P/Kd, where t12 is the time it takes for half the fluorescence to exit the bag with or without rAzu, and P is the concentration of rAzu inside the bag. To examine whether LMW-heparin competes with labeled BPTI for binding to rAzu, the same dialysis membranes were filled with 200 μl of PBS containing BPTI-CFSE (0.5 μm) together with rAzu (50 μm), in the presence or absence of LMW-heparin (100 μm). The membranes were then placed in 200 ml of buffer or buffer containing LMW-heparin, with stirring, at room temperature. Samples of 20 μl were withdrawn from the dialysis bags at specific times of incubation, 2 ml of PBS added, and the fluorescence measured as described above. E. coli cells (5 × 107) were incubated with 5 μm (10 μg) rAzu in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37 °C. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, washed twice to remove unbound rAzu, resuspended in PBS, 1% fetal bovine serum, and incubated with immune rabbit IgG anti-nAzu (1:100 (13Campanelli D. Detmers P.A. Nathan C.F. Gabay J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 904-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)) for 1 h at room temperature. Following the first antibody treatment, the bacteria were washed twice in PBS, 1% fetal bovine serum and incubated for an additional 30 min at room temperature with FITC-labeled secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG (1:800). The bacterial cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, washed once, and resuspended in PBS for fluorescence microscope observation. In the experiments where heparin or BPTI were added together with rAzu, E. coli cells (5 × 107) were incubated with LMW-heparin (10 μm) and rAzu (5 μm) or with BPTI (10 μm) and rAzu (5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C and treated as described above for detection of rAzu on the bacterial cell surfaces. Pretreatment of E. coli with LMW-heparin was done by incubating the bacteria first with heparin (10 μm) for 30 min at room temperature, washing the cell suspension twice with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, to remove excess heparin, resuspending the bacteria in the sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and incubating with 5 μm rAzu for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. In experiments where LMW-heparin was added to rAzu-treated bacteria, E. coli cells (5 × 107) were first treated with rAzu, washed once with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and incubated with LMW-heparin (10 μm) for 30 min at room temperature. Excess heparin was removed by washing in PBS. Detection of rAzu was performed with IgG anti-rAzu and FITC-labeled secondary antibodies as before. Radial diffusion assays were performed as described previously (22Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. E. coli K-12 (strain MC4100) and Streptococcus faecalis(ATCC 8043) were grown overnight in Trypticase Soy Broth and subcultured to mid-logarithmic phase (A600 = 0.6). Candida albicans (clinical isolate from Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, New York) was grown in Sabouraud's Broth overnight and subcultured until a count of 5–7 × 106cell/ml was reached. Bacteria (5 × 107/plate forE. coli; 1 × 107/plate for S. faecalis) were added to a 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 1% low electroendosmosis-agarose layer, and fungi (C. albicans; 4 × 106/plate) were added to layers containing 10 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 3.2, 1% low electroendosmosis-agarose. Triton X-100 (0.02%) and bovine serum albumin (0.02%) were added to the E. coli containing layers to enhance the sensitivity of the assay. Serial dilutions of wild-type and mutant rAzu proteins were added to wells punched into the agarose layer, allowed to diffuse, and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a humid chamber. Following the incubation period, 10 ml of 1% Bactoagar containing 6% Trypticase Soy Broth (for bacteria) or 6% Sabouraud's broth (for C. albicans) was added as top layer, and the plates were incubated overnight. A 7× measuring magnifier was used to measure the diameter of zones of growth inhibition. Units (1 unit = 0.1 mm diameter of clearing) on the y axis were plotted against protein concentration (μg/ml; x axis), and MIC values were obtained as intercepts on the x axis (22Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). RDA assays with addition of either BPTI or LMW-heparin were performed in the same manner except that varying concentrations of these ligands were incorporated into the lower layer. Neither BPTI (up to 10 μm) nor heparin alone affected the bacterial or fungal layers. Antimicrobial assays were also performed by plating bacteria or fungi for colony-forming units counts as described previously (2Gabay J.E. Scott R.W. Campanelli D. Griffith J. Wilde C. Marra M.N. Seeger M. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The Loop 3 and Loop 4 rAzu mutants were constructed by using the PCR overlap-extension technique (23Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). To generate the Loop 3 Azu DNA, two partially overlapping mutated fragments were prepared by PCR using primers T7 + 1 (300 bp) and 2 + T3 (700 bp) and wild-type Azu cDNA as template (TableI). The fragments were subsequently joined by PCR using the T7 and T3 primers and the resulting 1000-bp Azu DNA cloned into the pUC18 vector. The plasmid containing Azu DNA was digested with EcoRV-EcoRI to remove the Loop 3 Azu insert which was then purified and cloned into plasmid pKSII for sequencing. Ultimately, the Loop 3 mutant DNA was ligated into the PAcC4 transfer plasmid, and the Azu containing plasmid was purified by Qiagen midiprep kit for transfection. A similar strategy was used to generate the Loop 4 Azu DNA; the Loop 4 containing fragments were prepared by PCR using primers T7 + 3 (bp) and 4 + T3 (bp) and wild-type rAzu cDNA as template and extended by use of T7 and T3 primers. The double mutant Loop 3/Loop 4 was made from three partially overlapping fragments as follows: the 300-bp (T7 + 1) fragment (Loop 3); a 200-bp (2 + 3) fragment (Loop 3–Loop 4); and the 500-bp (4 + T3) fragment (Loop 4). All three fragments were sewn together by PCR using T7 and T3 primers. The double mutant Loop 3/Loop 4 Azu was sequenced as described above before cloning into pAcC4 and transfection into insect cells.Table IOligonucleotides used for construction of the Loop 3, Loop 4, Loop 3/Loop 4, and DMC1 mutantsNo.Sequence15′-GAACTGCTGGGGCTGCGCCTGCTGGCCGCCAACGATGTCCAAAAG-3′25′-GTTGGCGGCCAGCAGGCGCAGCCCCAGCAGTTCCCGTTCCTGGCCTCC-3′35′-GGGACTGCTGCTCCTGCTG TTGCAGGTCATAGGCACCCAGCAC-3′45′-ATGACCTGCAACAGCAGGAGCAGCAGTCCCGCCAGACGTTTTC-3′55′-GATGAGCGCGCCCCCGCAGAAGGACTGGCCTTGATTCTGAATGGA-3′65′-TTCTGCGGGGGCGCGCTCATCTCCGCCCAGTTCGTGATGACCGCGGCC-3′T75′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′T35′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′Mutational changes leading to amino acid substitutions are underlined.

Open table in a new tab Mutational changes leading to amino acid substitutions are underlined. Boldface letters indicate where nucleotides have been changed to create a BssHII restriction site without modifying the protein sequence. The DMC1 Azu DNA mutant was constructed by generating two fragments, one encoding for the R23Q,H24S mutation and the other for the H32S,R34Q mutation. Both fragments were made by PCR using primers T7 + 5 (300 bp; fragment 1) or primers 6 + T3 (700 bp; fragment 2) and wild-type Azu as template. A BssHII (5′-(G/C)GCGC-3′) site was incorporated on each complementary fragment to allow for subsequent cloning. Each mutated fragment was ligated into a separate pUC18 plasmid at theHincII site, digested with BssHII andEcoRV (fragment 1) or BssHII and EcoRI (fragment 2), purified, and combined into full-length Azu DNA by ligation into the pKS vector at the EcoRI-EcoRV cloning site. After sequencing confirmed the presence of the 4 mutational changes R23Q,H24S,H32S,R34Q and the absence of new unwanted mutation in the Azu DNA, the EcoRI-EcoRV Azu insert was transferred into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcC4. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared using the Qiagen midiprep kits. rAzu proteins (12 μg) were incubated with 25 μl of BPTI-Sepharose beads in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.8m NaCl for 1 h at room temperature in siliconized tubes. Beads were spun down and washed twice with the 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.8 m NaCl buffer. rAzu wild-type or mutant proteins bound onto BPTI-Sepharose beads were extracted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m urea and boiled in sample buffer. The molarity of proteins was calculated using theA280 of solutions of purified native and mutant rAzu and an EM = 14,900. For fluorescence spectroscopy, each protein was diluted to a final concentration of 5 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, and its emission spectrum (290–420 nm) was measured upon excitation at 280 nm. For CD spectroscopy, each protein was diluted to a final concentration of 20 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, and scanned by spectropolarimetry at wavelengths 180–260 nm. Previous work (4Flodgaard H. Ostergaard E. Bayne S. Svendsen A. Thomsen J. Engels M. Wollmer A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Petersen L.C. Birktoft J.J. Flodgaard H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) indicated that both heparin and the serine proteinase inhibitor BPTI act as ligands for neutrophil-derived Azu (nAzu). We therefore tested the ability of rAzu to bind to immobilized heparin or BPTI. Insect cell culture supernatants containing rAzu were loaded onto a heparin-agarose column and eluted with a gradient of 0.1 to 2 m NaCl. The rAzu eluted from the column at 1.0 m NaCl, a concentration previously shown to elute nAzu from heparin-agarose (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Similarly, rAzu from insect cell culture supernatants bound to a BPTI-Sepharose column in the presence of 0.8 m NaCl and was eluted by lowering the pH to 3.0 (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). These data are consistent with the conditions that have been reported to bind and elute nAzu from immobilized heparin and BPTI and provide initial evidence that the recombinant protein retains its ability to bind these ligands. To characterize further the interaction of rAzu with heparin, the intrinsic fluorescence of rAzu was measured in solutions containing different concentrations of either LMW- or HMW-heparin (average 3000 and 18,000 daltons, respectively). The addition of LMW-heparin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in fluorescence with half-maximal increase in fluorescence at 1.5 μm (Fig.1A). The binding curve was sigmoidal, which suggests that binding of heparin to rAzu was cooperative. This finding was consistent with the presence of at least two heparin-binding sites (Hill n = 1.8) in the Azu molecule (inset, Fig. 1A). When HMW-heparin was added to rAzu, the half-maximal increase in fluorescence was at 0.3 μm, along with a value of n = 1.82 for the Hill coefficient, indicating the presence of at least two binding sites for HMW-heparin on the rAzu molecule as well (Fig.1B). Addition of LMW- or HMW-heparin to the maltose-binding protein, a protein that does not bind heparin, did not result in alteration of its fluorescence (data not shown). To characterize the interaction between BPTI and rAzu, BPTI was labeled with a fluorophore (CFSE). An extrinsic fluorophore was used because the maximum emission for BPTI fluorescence is in the same range as that of rAzu. Preliminary experiments indicated that the CFSE-BPTI and unlabeled BPTI exhibited similar abilities to bind α-chymotrypsin (data not shown). Addition of increasing amounts of wild-type rAzu to BPTI-CFSE resulted in a decrease in the fluorescence. A double-reciprocal transformation of the data in Fig. 2 indicated that a half-maximal decrease in the fluorescence occurred in the presence of 15 μm rAzu. BPTI-CFSE binding to rAzu was also examined by the retention method described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3 shows that the diffusion of BPTI-CFSE across the membrane is slower in the presence of rAzu than in its absence. These data permit the calculation of an apparentKd value of 20 μm for the binding of rAzu to BPTI-CFSE. To examine whether BPTI and heparin compete for binding to the rAzu molecule, we examined the effect of heparin on the ability of BPTI-CFSE to bind rAzu using the retention assay. The data in Fig. 3 were used to calculate an apparent Kd of 13 μm for binding of rAzu to BPTI-CFSE in the presence of heparin. The fact that the apparent Kd values in the presence and absence of heparin were not dramatically different suggests that heparin and BPTI do not compete for binding to rAzu.Figure 3Binding of BPTI-CFSE to rAzu measured by the retention method. The diffusion of BPTI-CFSE across a dialysis membrane was measured at various time points in the presence (open square) or absence (open circle) of 50 μm rAzu. The diffusion of BPTI-CFSE was also measured in the presence of 100 μm LMW-heparin, with (filled squares) or without (filled circles) rAzu. Samples from inside the dialysis bag were removed, and the efflux of fluorescence (BPTI-CFSE) was monitored, using an excitation of 490 nm and an emission of 518 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We used an RDA to evaluate the effect of heparin on the antimicrobial activity of rAzu against three representative microorganisms, E. coli, S. faecalis, andC. albicans. LMW-heparin inhibited rAzu activity against all three microorganisms in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). The concentration of LMW-heparin required to reduce rAzu antimicrobial activity by half was 0.05 μm for E. coli and 0.5 μm forS. faecalis and C. albicans. Glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, HMW-heparin, and heparan sulfate were also found to inhibit rAzu antimicrobial activity (not shown).

The requirements for transcription factor (TF) IIIC and TFIIIB in Ty3 integration into the two initiation sites of the U6 gene carried on pU6LboxB were previously examined. Ty3 integrates at low but detectable frequencies in the presence of TFIIIB subunits Brf1 and TATA-binding protein. Integration increases in the presence of the third subunit, Bdp1. TFIIIC is not essential, but the presence of TFIIIC specifies an orientation of TFIIIB for transcriptional initiation and directs integration to the U6 gene-proximal initiation site. In the current study, recombinant wild type TATA-binding protein, wild type and mutant Brf1, and Bdp1 proteins and highly purified TFIIIC were used to investigate the roles of specific protein domains in Ty3 integration. The amino-terminal half of Brf1, which contains a TFIIB-like repeat, contributed more strongly than the carboxyl-terminal half of Brf1 to Ty3 targeting. Each half of Bdp1 split at amino acid 352 enhanced integration. In the presence of TFIIIB and TFIIIC, the pattern of integration extended downstream by several base pairs compared with the pattern observed in vitro in the absence of TFIIIC and in vivo, suggesting that TFIIIC may not be present on genes targeted by Ty3 in vivo. Mutations in Bdp1 that affect its interaction with TFIIIC resulted in TFIIIC-independent patterns of Ty3 integration. Brf1 zinc ribbon and Bdp1 internal deletion mutants that are competent for polymerase III recruitment but defective in promoter opening were competent for Ty3 integration irrespective of the state of DNA supercoiling. These results extend the similarities between the TFIIIB domains required for transcription and Ty3 integration and also reveal requirements that are specific to transcription."

Mutation of Tyr356 of Gα11 to Phe, within a receptor contact domain, had little effect on function but this was reduced greatly by alteration to Ser and virtually eliminated by conversion to Asp. This pattern was replicated following incorporation of each form of Gα11 into fusion proteins with the α1b-adrenoreceptor. Following a [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) binding assay, immunoprecipitation of the wild type α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein indicated that the agonist phenylephrine stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on Gα11 more than 30-fold. Information transfer by agonist was controlled in residue 356 Gα11 mutants with rank order Tyr > Phe > Trp > Ile > Ala = Gln = Arg > Ser > Asp, although these alterations did not alter the binding affinity of either phenylephrine or an antagonist ligand. Mutation of a β/γ contact interface in the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Tyr356 Gα11fusion protein did not alter ligand binding affinity but did reduce greatly β/γ binding and phenylephrine stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding. It also prevented agonist elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, as did a mutation in Gα11 that prevents G protein subunit dissociation. These results indicate that a bulky aromatic group is required four amino acids from the C terminus of Gα11 to maximize information transfer from an agonist-occupied receptor and disprove the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation of this residue is required for G protein activation (Umemori, H., Inoue, T., Kume, S., Sekiyama, N., Nagao, M., Itoh, H., Nakanishi, S., Mikoshiba, K., and Yamamoto, T. (1997)Science 276, 1878–1881). This is distinct from Gαi1, where hydrophobicity of the amino acid is the key determinant at this location. They also further demonstrate a key role for the β/γ complex in enhancing receptor to G protein α subunit information transfer.

G protein-coupled receptor guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Information transfer between G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 and G protein α subunits involves the induced release of GDP from the nucleotide binding site of the G protein and its subsequent replacement by GTP (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). This is often studied by monitoring the binding of an analogue of GTP, [35S]GTPγS, that is resistant to the in built GTPase activity of the G protein α subunit (2Wieland T. Jakobs K.H.

Receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ1 is mediated via members of the Gq family of G proteins (4Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Resistance of these G proteins to ADP-ribosylation by bacterial toxins and their low rates of guanine nucleotide exchange made their initial purification and characterization an extremely difficult task (7Taylor S.J. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 8Blank J.L. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 20519-20522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This second feature has also limited efforts to use the binding of [35S]GTPγS to monitor their activation. In contrast, the ease of use of this assay for members of the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi family of G proteins has resulted in its widespread application (2Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 1-13Google Scholar, 3Windh R.T. Lee M.J. Hla T., An, S. Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27351-27358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins have a conserved Cys located 4 amino acids from the C terminus that is the site of ADP-ribosylation by the toxin. As this modification prevents GPCR-mediated activation of these G proteins, it provided early compelling evidence of a key role for the extreme C-terminal region of G protein α subunits in productive interactions with GPCRs (10Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1998; 255: 1-13Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recently, extensive mutagenesis at this site in both Gαi1 (11Bahia D.S. Wise A. Fanelli F. Lee M. Rees S. Milligan G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11555-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Gαi3 (12Dupuis D.S. Wurch T. Tardif S. Colpaert F.C. Pauwels P.J. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 36-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has indicated that the Cys is not essential for information transfer and that the effectiveness of receptor-mediated activation is determined by the hydrophobicity of the residue at this position. The widely expressed Gq family G proteins, Gαq and Gα11, share an identical C-terminal decapeptide with Tyr356 located 4 amino acids from the C terminus of Gα11 (4Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that this Tyr can become phosphorylated in response to GPCR activation and that this may be a key event in activation of the G protein (13Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We have recently employed an immunoprecipitation strategy in concert with a [35S]GTPγS binding assay to monitor directly GPCR and agonist-induced guanine nucleotide exchange on Gα11 (14Stevens P.A. Pediani J. Carrillo J.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35883-35890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Herein we extend this approach to analyze the effects on information transfer between the α1b-adrenoreceptor and forms of Gα11 in which Tyr356 was altered to a range of amino acids. There is no inherent requirement for Tyr at this position and thus for its potential phosphorylation in the activation of the G protein. However, as Phe and Trp are the other amino acids that can substitute effectively a key role for a bulky aromatic group is evident. Although the guanine nucleotide binding site and GTPase machinery are defined by the G protein α subunit, the β/γ complex plays a key role, with growing evidence for a direct role of the γ subunit in contacting the receptor to enhance guanine nucleotide exchange (15Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41742-41747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,16Rondard P. Iiri T. Srinivasan S. Meng E. Fujita T. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6150-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). By mutating a key β/γ contact site in Gα11 we also provide support for this notion, because the modified α subunit exchanges guanine nucleotide significantly less effectively in response to receptor activation that does the wild type. Overexpression of β/γ with a fusion protein between the α1b-adrenoreceptor and the mutant form of Gα11 with reduced β/γ binding affinity enhances the effectiveness of agonist-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange.

MetaFluor imaging software (version 4.6.8, Universal Imaging Corp., Downing, PA) was used for control of the monochromator, CCD camera, and for processing of the cell image data. Sequential images (2 × 2 binning) were collected every 2 s, exposure to excitation light was 100 ms/image, and all experiments were undertaken in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in saline solution comprising: 130 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm d-glucose, 0.01 mm EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH. Ratio images were presented in MetaFluor intensity-modulated display mode (26Tsien R.Y. Harootunian A. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which associates the color hue with the excitation ratio value and the intensity of each hue with the source image brightness. Briefly background subtracted images acquired at 340 and 380 nm excitation were first used for calculating the 340/380 nm ratio of each pixel. After determination of the upper and lower thresholds, the ratio value of each pixel was associated with one of the 24 hues from blue (low [Ca2+] i ) to red (high [Ca2+] i ). Pooled average intensity-modulated display ratio intensity values measured from single cells were expressed as the mean ± S.E. mean of at least 10 cells with the vertical lines representing S.E. of mean. [35S]GTPγS binding experiments were initiated by the addition of membranes containing 100 fmol of the fusion constructs to an assay buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm guanosine 5′-diphosphate, 0.2 mm ascorbic acid, 50 nCi of [35S]GTPγS) containing the indicated concentrations of receptor ligands. Nonspecific binding was determined in the same conditions but in the presence of 100 μmGTPγS. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer, containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in solubilization buffer (100 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.25% Nonidet P-40) plus 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Samples were precleared with Pansorbin (Calbiochem), followed by immunoprecipitation with CQ antiserum (22Mitchell F.M. Buckley N.J. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,23Kim G.-D. Carr I.C. Anderson L.A. Zabavnik J. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19933-19940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or an antiserum against the N-terminal section of the α1b-adrenoreceptor. Finally, the immunocomplexes were washed twice with solubilization buffer and bound [35S]GTPγS estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Binding assays were initiated by the addition of 3 μg of cell membranes to an assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4)) containing [3H]prazosin (0.05–5 nm in saturation assays and 1.0 nm for competition assays), in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of phenylephrine. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μmphentolamine. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and bound ligand separated from free by vacuum filtration through GF/B filters. The filters were washed twice with assay buffer, and bound ligand was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For immunoprecipitations cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immediately homogenized in a lysis medium, containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mmNa4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were centrifuged (15 min, 13,000 rpm) and the supernatants precleared for 1 h with nonspecific serum and protein A. Next, samples were incubated overnight with the appropriate antiserum. The immunocomplexes were then captured with protein A-agarose. For immmunoblotting, cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked for 2 h with 5% nonfat dried milk in 0.05% Tween 20/Tris buffered saline (TTBS). Then, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antiserum and washed with TTBS. Membranes were incubated for 20 min with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000) (Amersham Biosciences). Finally, membranes were washed with TTBS and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Co-expression of the α1b-adrenoreceptor and Gα11 is required to elevate intracellular [Ca2+] in response to the α1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine in cells (EF88) derived from a combined Gαq and Gα11 knock-out mouse (Fig.1) (14Stevens P.A. Pediani J. Carrillo J.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35883-35890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because this effect is blocked by co-expression of α-transducin (Fig. 1), which is an effective β/γ sequestering agent, the response to agonist reflects activation of the G protein, the release of β/γ complex from the α subunit, and regulation of a β/γ-sensitive isoform of phospholipase Cβ. Co-expression of the α1-adrenoreceptor with Tyr356 → Asp Gα11 did not result in a significant elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1). These results indicate an important role for this residue in the G protein. When the α1b-adrenoreceptor was co-expressed with Tyr356 → Phe Gα11 the response to phenylephrine was only slightly lower and more delayed kinetically than with wild type Gα11 (Fig. 1). Such results negate the suggestion that phosphorylation of Tyr356Gα11 is required for its activation (13Umemori H. Inoue T. Kume S. Sekiyama N. Nagao M. Itoh H. Nakanishi S. Mikoshiba K. Yamamoto T. Science. 1997; 276: 1878-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Tyr356 → Ser Gα11 was also capable of being activated by the α1b-adrenoreceptor, but response was substantially lower and kinetically substantially slower than with wild type or Tyr356 → Phe Gα11 (Fig. 1). We have recently demonstrated that a fusion protein in which the N terminus of wild type Gα11 is linked to the C-terminal tail of the α1b-adrenoreceptor from which the stop codon was eliminated also releases β/γ complex and elevates Ca2+ levels in EF88 cells upon agonist stimulation (14Stevens P.A. Pediani J. Carrillo J.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35883-35890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were thus also constructed between the α1b-adrenoreceptor and each of the Tyr356 → Phe Gα11, Tyr356 → Ser Gα11, and Tyr356 → Asp Gα11 G proteins. Each of these fusion proteins was expressed in EF88 cells and the ability of phenylephrine to elevate intracellular Ca2+measured. These studies recapitulated the co-expression data. Virtually no signal was generated from the fusion containing Tyr356→ Asp Gα11, a poor signal was obtained from the Tyr356 → Ser Gα11 containing version, and similar and significantly greater signals were obtained from the fusion proteins containing the Tyr356 → Phe or wild type Gα11 (Fig. 2). Again, the signals obtained with the Phe and Ser mutants were delayed kinetically compared with those from the construct containing the wild type G protein (Fig. 2). As reported previously (14Stevens P.A. Pediani J. Carrillo J.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35883-35890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) co-expression of α-transducin fully attenuated the phenylephrine-mediated elevation of intracellular Ca2+ produced by α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11, and this was also the case for the fusion proteins containing both Tyr356 → Phe Gα11 and Tyr356 → Ser Gα11 (data not shown). As EF88 cells are difficult to transfect efficiently, many of the subsequent studies were performed in HEK293 cells. The transfected α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion proteins were detected in lysates of HEK293 cells as distinct doublets that probably reflect differential glycosylation of the receptor element of the polypeptides (Fig. 3 A). Each of the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion constructs containing the mutated forms of the G protein expressed as well as the fusion containing the wild type G protein as assessed by immunoblotting HEK293 cell lysates with an antiserum that identifies the extreme N terminus of the α1b-adrenoreceptor (Fig.3 A, top). This was apparently not true when the same lysates were immunoblotted with an antiserum (CQ) that identifies the C-terminal decapeptide of Gα11. Only the construct containing the wild type G protein was identified effectively (Fig.3 A, bottom). Unlike EF88 cells, HEK293 cells express both Gαq and Gα11 (14Stevens P.A. Pediani J. Carrillo J.J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35883-35890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, although antiserum CQ was unable to identify the fusion proteins containing the G protein mutants, it did identify the Gαq/Gα11 endogenously expressed in each sample (Fig. 3 A, bottom). Furthermore, ligand binding studies monitoring the specific binding of the α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist [3H]prazosin confirmed that each fusion protein was expressed to similar levels (Fig. 3 B). As the alteration in the G protein sequence was within the epitope used as antigen, it is thus likely that Tyr356 is a immunodominant element for identification of Gα11 by antiserum CQ (see also later under “Results”). HEK293 membranes expressing 100 fmol of the α1b-adrenoreceptor-wild type Gα11 fusion protein, as measured by the specific binding of [3H]prazosin, were subjected to a [35S]GTPγS binding assay followed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-Gαq/Gα11C-terminal antiserum. Very little [35S]GTPγS was present in the immunoprecipitate (Fig.4). However, addition of phenylephrine during the assay increased the levels of [35S]GTPγS present in the immunoprecipitate in a concentration-dependent manner. A maximally effective concentration of phenylephrine increased the level of bound [35S]GTPγS nearly 30-fold with EC50 for phenylephrine of 3.3 × 10−7m (Fig.4 A). Equivalent results were obtained when the experiments were repeated but immunoprecipitation performed with the antibody directed toward the N terminus of the α1b-adrenoreceptor. The EC50 for phenylephrine was now 6.0 × 10−7m, and although a lower number of counts of [35S]GTPγS were present in these immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 B), this simply reflects the immunoprecipitation efficiencies achieved with the amounts of the two antibodies employed (data not shown). Further fusion proteins were constructed between the α1b-adrenoreceptor and forms of Gα11 with each of the Trp, Ile, Ala, Gln, and Arg residues at position 356 of the G protein. These also were identified poorly by antiserum CQ but were expressed at similar levels as the other fusion proteins as monitored by saturation binding assays using [3H]prazosin. Membrane amounts corresponding to 100 fmol of the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion proteins containing Ser or Trp as residue 356 of the G protein were then used in [35S]GTPγS binding assays employing a range of concentrations of phenylephrine. Samples were immunoprecipitated with the anti-α1b-adrenoreceptor antibody and counted (Fig. 4 B). Although the effectiveness of phenylephrine to stimulate nucleotide binding to the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion proteins containing Trp356 → Gα11 and particularly Ser356 → Gα11 was substantially lower than for the wild type (Fig. 4 B), this did not reflect a reduction in potency of the agonist. There was less than a 2-fold difference in the EC50 for phenylephrine between the three constructs (Fig. 4 B). Each of the nine fusion proteins were then expressed in HEK293 cells, and following saturation [3H]prazosin binding assays to determine expression levels, membrane amounts containing 100 fmol of each construct were used to measure basal and phenylephrine-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding. Samples were subsequently immunoprecipitated with the anti-α1b-adrenoreceptor antibody and counted (Fig.5 A). A clear pattern emerged with the profile of [35S]GTPγS binding being that Tyr > Phe > Trp > Ile > Ala,Gln,Arg > Ser > Asp. Most effective guanine nucleotide exchange was obtained with amino acids containing an aromatic ring in the side chain. This did not reflect differences in the affinity of phenylephrine to bind to the individual constructs (Fig. 5,B and C). However, results were not the same when such [35S]GTPγS binding assays were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-Gαq/Gα11antiserum CQ. Most of the constructs apparently functioned very poorly compared with the wild type sequence (data not shown). However, as noted earlier, this reflects that the various fusion proteins are not immunoprecipitated or immunodetected equally by this antiserum (see Fig. 3 B). As Ca2+ elevation in EF88 cells is dependent upon β/γ release, we generated a form of the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein by mutation of Gly208 of the G protein to Ala. This was anticipated to be unable to exchange guanine nucleotide and thus should not be able to release β/γ in an agonist-dependent manner. We also mutated residues in Gα11(Ile25 → Ala,Glu26 → Ala) in a region shown previously (25Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to be a key β/γ contact region for Gαq. Following co-transfection of either the wild type α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein or α1b-adrenoreceptor-(Ile25 → Ala,Glu26 → Ala) Gα11 with a combination of the G protein β1 and γ2subunits cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Gαq/Gα11 antiserum. These samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted to detect the β1subunit (Fig. 6 top). This was effectively co-immunoprecipitated with the wild type α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein, but it was hardly detectable following immunoprecipitation of the α1b-adrenoreceptor-(Ile25 → Ala,Glu26 → Ala) Gα11 fusion protein (Fig. 6, top). This was not a reflection of poor expression of the β1 subunit with the α1b-adrenoreceptor-(Ile25 → Ala,Glu26 → Ala) Gα11 fusion protein as direct immunoblots of the cell lysates demonstrated equal levels of this subunit in the two samples (Fig. 6, middle). The α1b-adrenoreceptor-(Ile25 → Ala,Glu26 → Ala) Gα11 fusion protein was also expressed as effectively as the fusion protein containing the wild type G protein (Fig. 6, bottom). Neither the α1b-adrenoreceptor-(Ile25 → Ala,Glu26 → Ala) Gα11 nor the α1b-adrenoreceptor-(Gly208 → Ala) Gα11 fusion protein caused effective elevation of intracellular [Ca2+] in response to phenylephrine following expression in EF88 cells (Fig.7).Figure 7Fusion proteins that fail to bind or release β1/γ2 complex do not elevate [Ca2+] i effectively in EF88 cells.EF88 cells were transfected to express the wild type α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein (black) or variants of this (α1b-adre"

To investigate the role of fruA andcsgA genes in developmental gene expression, developing cells as well as vegetative cells of M. xanthus wild-type,fruA::Tc, and csgA731 strains were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and the whole cell proteins were analyzed using two-dimensional immobilized pH gradient/SDS-PAGE. Differences in protein synthesis patterns among more than 700 protein spots were detected during development of the three strains.

One example is the formation of fruiting bodies in Myxococcus xanthus (1Shimkets L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 473-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dworkin M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 70-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M. xanthus cells grow vegetatively in nutrient medium with a doubling time of 4 h. Upon nutrient starvation on a solid surface, they begin to gather in an aggregation center by gliding. Within 4–12 h post-starvation, they form mounds that eventually convert into fruiting bodies. Within the fruiting bodies, the motile, rod-shaped vegetative cells differentiate into non-motile, spherical myxospores. Rippling, a synchronous cell movement resembling traveling waves, occurs during the early phase of aggregation (3Shimkets L. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 451-461PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of programmed gene expression and protein synthesis during development is important to understand the M. xanthusdevelopmental process. Using one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Inouye et al. (4Inouye M. Inouye S. Zusman D.R. Dev. Biol. 1979; 68: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that at least 15 proteins were specifically synthesized during the development ofM. xanthus, suggesting that development is governed by a highly ordered program. They identified several major developmental proteins including proteins S and U, which were subsequently extensively characterized (5Inouye S. Franceschini T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6829-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Gollop R. Inouye M. Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3597-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kroos et al. (7Kroos L. Kuspa A. Kaiser D. Dev.

A set of developmental gene fusions to Tn5 lac has been identified and used as developmental markers to analyze the developmental process. Each marker Tn5 lac insertion strain initiates β-galactosidase expression at a specific time during development. The exchange of five extracellular signals, A-, B-, C-, D-, and E-signal, is required to execute normal development of M. xanthus (8Hagen D.C. Bretscher A.P. Kaiser D. Dev.

Mutations defective in C-signaling resulted in a developmental arrest at 6 h post-starvation and diminished expression of Tn5 lac fusions that are normally expressed after 6 h (12Kroos L. Kaiser D. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 840-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). C-signal mutants are unable to aggregate and are defective in sporulation (3Shimkets L. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 451-461PubMed Google Scholar). All C-signal mutations were mapped to thecsgA gene encoding a homologue of short chain alcohol dehydrogenase (13Baker M. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A 25-kDa protein encoded by the entirecsgA gene was produced at a basal level during vegetative growth and induced during development, whereas a 17-kDa protein was produced after 6 h post-starvation (14Kruse T.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2964-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The 17-kDacsgA protein is a cell surface associated-protein called C-factor and carries an activity that extracellularly complements thecsgA mutations during development (16Kim S.K. Kaiser D.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5299-5306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fruA gene encoding a putative transcription factor essential for the development of M. xanthus has been identified (19Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of FruA protein contains a DNA-binding motif and shares similarity with response regulators of two-component His-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction systems (19Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,20Ellehauge E. Norregaard-Madsen M. Søgaard-Andersen L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). FruA protein possesses an aspartic acid residue that can be potentially phosphorylated. Analysis through the introduction of mutations into the aspartic acid residue suggested the possibility of C-signal-dependent phosphorylation of FruA (20Ellehauge E. Norregaard-Madsen M. Søgaard-Andersen L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The expression of the fruA gene initiates at 6 h post-starvation and increases to reach a maximal level after 12 h (19Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The fruA mutant exhibited a phenotype similar to that of the csgA mutant (19Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Søgaard-Andersen L. Slack F.J. Kimsey H. Kaiser D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 740-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A model in which C-signal transduction requires FruA function was proposed (20Ellehauge E. Norregaard-Madsen M.

To investigate the effects of csgA and fruAmutations on developmental gene expression in M. xanthus, developing cells as well as vegetative cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and whole cell proteins were analyzed using two-dimensional immobilized pH gradient/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (GE),1 which has been used to analyze heat-shock-induced proteins in M. xanthus (22Otani M. Tabata J. Ueki T. Sano K. Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6282-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At least 14 proteins exhibited apparently different expression patterns among the wild-type, fruA::Tc, andcsgA731 strains during development. Five of the 14 proteins were identified by immunoblot analysis and mass spectroscopy. We succeeded in cloning a novel gene, dofA, whose expression was dependent on FruA function. These proteins are useful as developmental markers for the analysis of M. xanthusfruiting body formation. M. xanthus strains DZF1 sglA1 (4Inouye M. Inouye S. Zusman D.R. Dev.

To label cellular proteins during vegetative growth, M. xanthus DZF1 cells were grown in CTT medium at 30 °C and harvested in the exponential phase of growth. The cells were resuspended in A1 medium containing 67 μm[35S]methionine (0.33 mCi/mmol) and further grown at 30 °C for 30 h. To induce development, concentrated M. xanthus DZF1, MO1fruA::Tc, and DK731 csgA731 cells were spotted on TM agar plates as described previously (4Inouye M. Inouye S. Zusman D.R. Dev. Biol. 1979; 68: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After 1, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h, cells were labeled for 2 h by adding 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine under the TM agar. Two-dimensional GE was performed as described by Otani et al. (22Otani M. Tabata J. Ueki T. Sano K. Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6282-6287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the labeled cells were disrupted by sonication in L buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (w/v) CHAPS, and 2% (v/v) ampholine (pH 3–10)). The whole cell extract was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of R buffer (8m urea, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.5% ampholine (pH 3–10)) and subjected to rehydration of Immobiline DryStrip (Amersham Biosciences; pH 3–10, 13 cm). Following isoelectric focusing, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (13%) and detected by fluorography. To compare protein patterns during development among various M. xanthus strains, proteins from the same cell number spotted on the TM plate were applied to each gel. Image analysis and quantification of protein spots were achieved with Melanie II 2-D PAGE software (Bio-Rad). Cell proteins were separated by two-dimensional GE and detected by staining of the gel with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (CBB). Protein spots of interest were excised and digested in situ with trypsin (26Taoka M. Wakamiya A. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1872-1879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The tryptic peptides generated were purified on reversed-phase resin (POROS R2; Applied Biosystems) and administered into a collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS) using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass) equipped with nanospray tip. Amino acid sequences of the peptides were determined by manualde novo interpretation of their y-type production series (27Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described previously (24Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moor D. Seidman J. Smith J. Strauhle K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar, 25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

To clone a gene encoding the spot 11 protein, four degenerate PCR primers were designed from the amino acid sequences of two peptides determined by MS/MS sequencing (see Table I). Using the primer set of 5′-GT(G/C)GAGGG(G/C)AACGAC(A/C)T(G/C)(A/C)AGTACAA-3′ and 5′-CTTCTC(G/C)AC(G/C)A(G/T)GTT(G/C)A(G/T)(G/C)CC-3′, a 69-bp PCR product was amplified from the chromosomal DNA of M. xanthusDZF1. Since the amino acid sequence deduced from the PCR product was consistent with those of two peptides from the spot 11 protein, the PCR product was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and used to screen a gene library containing 1.0–1.5-kb HincII fragments of M. xanthus DNA in pUC19. A positive clone designated pSP11 and containing a 1.1-kbHincII fragment was obtained and sequenced.Table IAmino acid sequences and relative molecular masses of tryptic peptides derived from the spot 3, 10, 11, and 13 proteinsProtein1-aThe observed and calculated molecular mass of each peptide is shown as relative molecular weight.Amino acid sequenceRelative molecular mass (Mr)1-aThe observed and calculated molecular mass of each peptide is shown as relative molecular weight.From MS/MS sequence1-b“Xs” indicates unidentified amino acid residues during sequence analysis. “M” shows methionine sulfoxide.From DNA sequence1-cAmino acid sequences were taken from: EF-Tu, this study (GenBank™: AB073986); Dru, Ref.28 (NCBI No. 710341); DofA, this study (GenBank™: AB073987); and protein S, Ref. 6(NCBI No. 118462).ObservedCalculatedSpot 3 (EF-Tu; 43.4 kDa, pI 5.6)1-dCalculated molecular mass and isoelectric point of each spot protein are shown in parentheses.VD(F/M)(L/I)DDPE(L/I)R138VDMLDDPELR1471217.281217.56EGDTSD(L/I)GEPA(L/I)(L/I)K178ALEGDTSDIGEPAILK1931627.481627.83EAVDSY(L/I)PTXsR194LMEAVDSYIPTPQR2071634.461634.80VTGVE(F/M)(F/M)R256TVVTGVEMFR2651153.321153.58Spot 10 (Dru; 18.5 kDa, pI 7.5)NE(L/I)T(L/I)SV(L/I)R41SKNELTLSVLR511258.401258.73AE(L/I)S(L/I)(L/I)QXs(L/I)PK104EEAEISILQNYLPK1171645.421645.86Q(L/I)TADE(L/I)AAEVR118QLTADELAAEVR1291314.341314.68Spot 11 (DofA; 16.6 kDa, pI 9.2)A(L/I)VEGND(L/I)QYN(L/I)QR76PLFTEIHAIVEGNDLQYNLQR962468.862469.27V(L/I)(L/I)SG(L/I)N(L/I)VTR97VIISGINLVTR1071183.521183.73Spot 13 (Protein S; 18.8 kDa, pI 4.4)(L/I)TV(F/M)YNED(F/M)QGK2ANITVFYNEDFQGK151644.381644.78QVD(L/I)PPGXsTR16QVDLPPGNYTR261258.301258.63AA(L/I)G(L/I)ENNT(L/I)SSVK27AQLAALGIENNTISSVK431727.501727.94(L/I)PPGQYTQAE(L/I)ER105EVDLPPGQYTQAELER1201843.461843.90The spot 3, 10, 11, and 13 proteins (Fig. 1) were excised from CBB-stained two dimensional gel and digested in situ with trypsin.

The resultant tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel, separated by reversed-phase resin, and sequenced by nanospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry. To compare the patterns of protein synthesis during vegetative growth and development, M. xanthus DZF1 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine during vegetative growth and during development (after 12 h post-starvation). Whole cell proteins were separated by two-dimensional GE followed by fluorography (Fig.1, A and B). Protein spots were profiled and quantified using Melanie II 2-D PAGE software. Both of the two-dimensional GE images contained 700–1200 distinct protein spots depending on the gel exposure time to x-ray film and the amount of proteins applied to the gels. The patterns of protein synthesis differed greatly between vegetative and developing cells. The synthetic rates of more than 150 proteins in developing cells (after 12 h post-starvation) of M. xanthus DZF1 were down-regulated as compared with those in vegetative cells, whereas those of more than 100 proteins were up-regulated. The down-regulated or up-regulated protein spots are described in the supplemental materials. In the present study, M. xanthusdevelopment was induced by spotting vegetative cells on TM agar to maximize [35S]methionine incorporation. Under these conditions, M. xanthus DZF1 cells formed fruiting bodies in a process similar to that on CF agar, generally used for development (Fig. 2A). M. xanthus fruA::Tc cells arrested development after formation of abnormal mounds, whereas M. xanthus csgA731 cells arrested development at the stage of early aggregation (Fig. 2A). The DZF1 cells formed rigid aggregates at 18 h, whereas the fruA andcsgA mutants did not.Figure 2Time courses of morphogenesis and synthetic rates of 14 proteins during development of M. xanthuswild-type, fruA::Tc, andcsgA731 strains.

The whole cell proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional GE followed by fluorography. Fig. 1, B–D, compares the two-dimensional GE images of three strains at 12 h post-starvation. At this stage of development, fruA andcsgA mutants produced fewer numbers of proteins than the wild-type strain, whereas the protein synthesis patterns infruA and csgA mutants were similar. This result may be due to the fact that developmental arrest in fruA andcsgA mutants occurs at a similar period during development. At least 50 proteins were produced only in the wild-type strain in comparison with the fruA and csgA mutants after 12 h (see supplemental materials), suggesting that expression of these proteins is dependent on fruA and csgAgenes. Detailed comparisons of Fig. 1, C and D, as well as the gel patterns of the other developmental stages infruA and csgA mutants (Fig. 2), however, indicated that the syntheses of several proteins were differently regulated during development in fruA and csgAmutants. We have selected 14 of these proteins, which are indicated by the numbers 1–14 in Fig. 1, for further analysis. Five of the 14 selected proteins were identified by Western blot analysis or mass spectroscopy. The spot 12 protein was identified as FruA protein since anti-FruA antibody reacted with the spot 12 protein by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Production of the spot 12 protein was not detected in thefruA mutant, whereas FruA production was observed in thecsgA mutant (Fig. 1, C and D). Among the 14 protein spots detected by [35S]methionine labeling (Fig. 1B), four spots were visible on the CBB-stained two-dimensional gel of M. xanthus DZF1 proteins at 12 h post-starvation, whereas the remaining 10 spots (including FruA) were undetectable by CBB staining (data not shown). Amino acid sequences of the tryptic peptides from the four spots were determined by nanospray tandem mass spectrum analysis after in-gel digestion with trypsin. Fig. 3 shows a typical mass spectrum for a tryptic peptide derived from the spot 13 protein. The amino acid sequence and relative molecular mass of the peptide were determined to be AA(L/I)G(L/I)ENNT(L/I)SSVK and 1727.50, respectively (Table I). Amino acid sequences and molecular masses of three additional tryptic peptides from the spot 13 protein were also determined (Table I). Computer analysis of the observed sequences and masses revealed that the tryptic peptides corresponded to those of protein S, indicating that spot 13 is protein S. The molecular mass and pI of protein S are estimated to be 19 kDa and 4.4, respectively, which are in good agreement with the location of spot 13 on the two-dimensional gel (Fig. 1). Amino acid sequences and masses of four tryptic peptides from the spot 3 protein corresponded to those for putative EF-Tu of M. xanthus (Table I), indicating that spot 3 is EF-Tu. Spot 3 was one of the largest spots in the vegetative cells (Fig. 1A). Amino acid sequences and molecular masses of three tryptic peptides from the spot 10 protein corresponded to the product of a hypothetical gene tentatively designated dru (downstream ofrpsU) located in the rpsU operon ofM. xanthus (28Davis J.M. Mayor J. Plamann L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 943-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The rpsU operon consists of, in order, rpsU, dru, dnaG,rpoD, and ogt genes. The dru gene encodes a conserved protein of unknown function. It is of interest that genes encoding homologues of M. xanthus Dru are also located downstream of rpsU in many bacterial genomes. Since expression of the spot 11 protein was dependent onfruA, tryptic peptides from the spot 11 protein were also analyzed by mass spectroscopy, although spot 11 was rather faint on the CBB-stained two-dimensional gel. The amino acid sequences of two peptides were determined (Table I). Degenerate primers corresponding to the two peptides were constructed and used for PCR amplification withM. xanthus chromosomal DNA as a template. A PCR product of 69 bp was produced and used to clone an M. xanthus gene encoding the spot 11 protein. The cloned DNA contained a gene tentatively designated dofA (dependenton fruA). The dofA gene encodes a protein of 148 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 16.6 kDa (Fig. 4). There is no known protein showing significant similarity to DofA in the protein databases. The observed amino acid sequences of the two tryptic peptides correspond to those of the dofA product (Fig. 4,underline). In Fig. 2, changes in the synthesis of the spot 1–11 proteins during the development of M. xanthus wild-type, fruA::Tc, andcsgA731 strains are indicated as three specificwindows a, b, and c (as originally delineated in Fig. 1) of every gel. The synthetic rates of 14 proteins including the spot 12, 13, and 14 proteins were estimated as changes in the percent spot volume of each protein by Melanie II 2-D PAGE software and summarized as 14 graphs illustrated in Fig. 2. Synthesis of EF-Tu (spot 3) and Dru (spot 10) was active during vegetative growth of M. xanthus wild type (percentage of volume: EF-Tu, 3.9% and Dru, 0.6%) (Fig. 1A), whereas it decreased to a very low level shortly after the onset of development (Fig. 2, B and D, graphs 3 and10). RelA-dependent accumulation of ppGpp (and pppGpp) at the early stage of M. xanthus development has been reported (29Manoil C. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 297-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Manoil C. Kaiser D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 305-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Singer M. Kaiser D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Harris B.Z. Kaiser D. Singer M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1022-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the synthesis of stable RNA and protein synthesis machinery including EF-Tu and RpsU is strongly inhibited by (p)ppGpp, which is known as the stringent response (33Cashel M. Gentry D. Hernandez J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Therefore, it is most likely that the synthesis of EF-Tu and Dru (the product of the second gene of the rpsU operon) is also regulated by the stringent response in M. xanthus. In the wild-type strain and the csgA mutant, EF-Tu and Dru synthesis recovered at a later stage of development, whereas minimal recovery was observed in the fruA mutant. Under the present conditions, synthesis of the 12 remaining proteins was not detected during vegetative growth, suggesting that these proteins are the products of developmental genes. The synthetic rate of the spot 14 protein was very high shortly after the onset of development in the wild-type, fruA::Tc, andcsgA731 strains, whereas its synthesis could not be detected during vegetative growth, indicating that the spot 14 protein is the product of an early developmental gene (Fig. 2, graph 14). In the wild-type M. xanthus strain, the synthetic rate of the spot 14 protein decreased gradually and reached a minimal level after 18 h, whereas the decrease in its synthetic rate was slow in the fruA and csgA mutants. Changes in the synthetic rate of the spot 6 protein during development were similar to those of the spot 14 protein except that its synthetic rate in the fruA mutant decreased at a rate similar to the wild type but different from that observed for the csgA mutant (Fig. 2C, graph 6). In the wild-type M. xanthus strain, synthesis of three developmental gene products, including the spot 5 and 7 proteins and FruA, started at 1–4 h post-starvation (Fig. 2C,graphs 5, 7, and 12). During development, the synthetic rate of the spot 7 protein increased to reach a peak at 12 h and then decreased. Synthetic rates of the spot 5 protein and FruA increased to reach a maximal level at 12 h, and their high synthetic rates were nearly maintained until 24 h. FruA synthesis observed in this work is consistent with the previous results of fruA transcript and product accumulation (19Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The effects of the fruA and csgA mutations on the expression of these proteins were different from each other. In thefruA mutant, FruA production was not observed, as expected. The fruA mutation did not affect spot 5 protein synthesis, whereas it severely suppressed spot 7 protein synthesis. In contrast, the csgA mutation severely suppressed spot 5 protein synthesis, whereas the effects of the csgA mutation on spot 7 protein synthesis were not so marked. In the csgAmutant, the increase in the synthetic rate of FruA was slower than that observed in the wild type, but FruA expression was similar to that of the wild type at 18 h. In the wild-type M. xanthus strain, synthesis of the spot 1, 2, and 4 proteins, DofA, and protein S started at 4–8 h post-starvation (Fig. 2, B–D, graphs 1,2, 4, 11, and 13). The effects of the fruA and csgA mutations on the expression of such developmental proteins also differed among them. Synthesis of the spot 1 and 2 proteins, DofA, and protein S was dependent on FruA function, whereas residual synthesis of these proteins was observed in the csgA mutant. In contrast, synthesis of the spot 4 protein was dependent on CsgA function, whereas even higher synthesis of spot 4 was observed in the fruAmutant. The delayed synthesis of FruA in the csgA mutant (Fig. 2B, graph 12) may result in the delayed synthesis of the spot 1 protein, DofA, and protein S in thecsgA mutant (Fig. 2, B and D,graphs 1, 11, and 13). In wild-type M. xanthus strain, synthesis of the spot 8 and 9 proteins started at 18 h post-starvation (Fig. 2C,graphs 8 and 9). Synthesis of the spot 8 protein was dependent on both FruA and CsgA functions, whereas that of the spot 9 protein was not dependent. The fruA mutation even enhanced the synthesis of the spot 9 protein. The defects in fruiting body formation in M. xanthus fruA::Tc and csgA731 strains have been reported to be complemented by the introduction of wild-typefruA and csgA alleles into the M. xanthus chromosomal Mx8 attB site and csgAlocus, respectively (19Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 34Shimkets L.J. Gill R.E. Kaiser D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The complemented strain, MO2sglA1 fruA::Tc Ω5 Mx8attB::pMFA05 (fruA +), displayed a protein synthesis pattern similar to that of the wild-type strain during development (data not shown). In the present work, the patterns of protein synthesis during vegetative growth and development of M. xanthus have been analyzed by two-dimensional GE. Comparison of the two-dimensional GE image of vegetative cells with that of developing cells after 12 h post-starvation revealed that synthesis of more than 250 protein spots was up- or down-regulated. The effects of the fruA andcsgA mutations on gene expression during development were also analyzed by two-dimensional GE, and several proteins were found to be differently regulated during development in the fruA andcsgA mutants. The effects of A- to E-signals on the expression of various Tn5 lac fusions have been extensively studied during the development of M. xanthus (11Kaiser D. Kroos L. Dworkin M. Kaiser D. Myxobacteria II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 257-283Google Scholar). When β-galactosidase activity from a specific Tn5 lac fusion is not expressed in the A- to E-signal mutants during development, the Tn5 lac fusion is referred to as A- to E-signal-dependent, respectively. The expression of at least 10 Tn5 lac fusions were reported to be dependent on the csgA gene (11Kaiser D. Kroos L. Dworkin M. Kaiser D. Myxobacteria II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 257-283Google Scholar). In the present work, we found that the synthesis of the spot 4, 5, and 8 proteins was dependent on csgA, similar to the C-signal-dependent Tn5 lac fusions described above. The production of six proteins including the spot 1, 2, 7, and 8 proteins, DofA, and protein S was demonstrated to be dependent on FruA function. Production of protein S and expression of Tn5 lacΩ4273, regulated by the tps (encoding protein S) promoter, was shown previously to be dependent on FruA function (19Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), consistent with the present results. Among sixfruA-dependent proteins, only the production of the spot 8 protein was dependent on CsgA function. The regulation of synthesis of the selected 14 proteins by fruA andcsgA genes during development of M. xanthus was summarized in Table II. Although bothfruA and csgA genes regulate the early development of M. xanthus, the fruA andcsgA mutations differently regulate expression of some specific developmental genes.Table IIRegulation of the spot 1–14 protein synthesis by fruA and csgA genes during development of M. xanthusClassProtein2-aProteins are represented by the spot number shown in Fig. 1.(i) fruA- andcsgA-independent6, 14(ii) fruA-dependent,csgA-independent1, 2, 7, 11 (DofA), 13 (Protein S)(iii) csgA-dependent,fruA-independent4, 5(iv) fruA- andcsgA-dependent8(v) Stringent response3 (EF-Tu), 10 (Dru)(vi) Not classified9, 12 (FruA)2-a Proteins are represented by the spot number shown in Fig. 1. Open table in a new tab The finding that the expression of several genes includingtps and dofA are dependent on FruA function but independent of CsgA function cannot be explained by the previous proposal, in which the activation of FruA by phosphorylation requires the association of C-signal located on the cell surface with a membrane-bound receptor-type histidine kinase of neighboring cells (20Ellehauge E. Norregaard-Madsen M. Søgaard-Andersen L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This model suggests that the expression of allfruA-dependent genes would be also dependent on C-signaling. Postulation of the existence of two distinct levels of FruA phosphorylation, low level and high level phosphorylation, may explain this apparent discrepancy (Fig.5). For the expression offruA-dependent/csgA-independent genes, weakly phosphorylated FruA protein is sufficient. Low level FruA phosphorylation may be accomplished by a putative histidine protein kinase (HPK) X in the absence of C-signal. For the expression of manyfruA-dependent/csgA-dependent genes, highly phosphorylated FruA protein is required. High level FruA phosphorylation may be accomplished by HPK X in the presence of C-signal. Alternatively, C-signal may inhibit dephosphorylation of phosphorylated FruA protein. It is known that the expression ofompF and ompC, encoding outer membrane porins, is differently regulated by the phosphorylation level of OmpR response regulator via the EnvZ-OmpR phosphorelay in the E. coliosmoregulation system (38Forst S. Delgado J. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6052-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Production of the spot 14 protein started during the early stage of development and was maintained until the later stages of development in the fruA and csgA mutants, whereas it was repressed at the later stages of development in the wild-type strain. In the fruA mutant, the expression of three Tn5 lac fusions, Ω4408, Ω4521, and Ω4455, known to be induced during early stages of development, was found to be still inducible but was no longer repressed at a later stage of development (19Ogawa M. Fujitani S. Mao X. Inouye S. Komano T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The present results strongly suggest that EF-Tu and Dru syntheses are regulated by the M. xanthus stringent response. The stringent response is an important signal for entry into the developmental process, and an M. xanthus relA mutant has been shown to be unable to develop (31Singer M. Kaiser D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Harris B.Z. Kaiser D. Singer M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1022-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The socEmutation bypassed the csgA requirement for development (39Crawford E.W. Shimkets L.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 483-492PubMed Google Scholar). The socE gene was normally expressed during vegetative growth, whereas socE expression was repressed by the stringent response when M. xanthus cells started the developmental process. Depletion of the socE gene was toxic for vegetative growth since socE depletion induces the stringent response even in the presence of amino acids. ThesocE expression could not be recovered during development. In contrast, EF-Tu and Dru expression was recovered during development. The recovery in EF-Tu and Dru synthesis may not be attributable to the end of the stringent response since (p)ppGpp was shown to be maintained at high levels during development (39Crawford E.W. Shimkets L.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 483-492PubMed Google Scholar). The timing of their recovery was different, and the fruA and csgA mutations differently affected their expression during development. These results suggest that mechanisms for the recovery of EF-Tu and Dru expression from the stringent response are different. Whereas the Tn5 lac fusion experiments determined the amounts of accumulated β-galactosidase, the pulse-labeling experiments used in the present work determined the synthetic rates of various proteins. Hence, the pulse-labeling experiments present an advantage for the analysis of the timing and regulation of gene expression during M. xanthus development. In addition, pulse-labeling experiments are essential for the identification of proteins with high turnover rates. The spot 14 protein may be an example of such high turnover proteins. The spot 14 protein exhibited a high synthetic rate during the early stages of development, whereas it could not be detected by CBB staining after 12 h, suggesting its high turnover. Many of the 14 proteins described in the present work can be used as developmental markers for the analysis of fruiting body formation in M. xanthus. We succeeded in cloning a novel gene dofA, whose expression was dependent on FruA function but not on CsgA function. Further analysis of dofA will facilitate the elucidation of the function of FruA, a key factor for fruiting body formation of M. xanthus. Such work is currently in progress in our laboratory.

Using human megakaryocytic cell lines representing different stages in megakaryocyte (Mk) maturation as well as stem cells and immature and mature megakaryocytes, we show that the inhibition by prostacyclin develops at a late maturation stage shortly before platelets are formed. This late appearance is not caused by insufficient cAMP formation or absent protein kinase A (PKA) activity in immature cells. Instead, the appearance of Ca2+ inhibition by prostacyclin is accompanied by a sharp increase in the expression of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C) but not by changes in the expression of the PKA-regulatory subunits Iα/β, IIα, and IIβ. Overexpression of PKA-C in the megakaryocytic cell line CHRF-288-11 potentiates the Ca2+ inhibition by prostacyclin. Thus, up-regulation of PKA-C appears to be a key step in the development of Ca2+ inhibition by prostacyclin in platelets.

Platelet agonists raise [Ca2+]i by the direct stimulation of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (1Daniel J.L. Dangelmaier C. Jin J. Ashby B. Smith J.B. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol.

IP3 activates IP3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum, releasing Ca2+ into the cytosol. The depleted Ca2+ stores trigger store-operated Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane (4Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCAs) then remove Ca2+ ions from the cytosol and restore the basal [Ca2+]iconcentration of about 70 nm (5Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). In the circulation, uncontrolled platelet activation is prevented by the platelet inhibitors prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) and nitric oxide produced by endothelial cells. Prostacyclin binds to IP receptors that start cAMP formation via the GTP-binding protein Gs and adenylyl cyclase. The importance of this pathway is reflected by the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and angina in patients with impaired platelet cAMP production (6Kahn N.N. Mueller H.S. Sinha A.K. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Kahn N.N. Bauman W.A. Sinha A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lancet. 1984; 2: 838-841Abstract PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of cAMP are mediated via protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates and thereby inactivates numerous signaling elements in platelet-activating pathways such as the thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor type α (9Walsh M.T. Foley J.F. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20412-20423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), phospholipase Cβ3 (PLC-β3) (10Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and IP3receptors (11Wojcikiewicz R.J. Luo S.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5545-5551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because a small rise in cAMP already leads to a strong activation of PKA, Ca2+ signaling in platelets is extremely sensitive to increases in cAMP (13Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrgge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because platelets are synthesized by megakaryocytes (Mks), one would expect a similar suppression of Ca2+ responses by prostacyclin in these progenitor cells. There are indications that the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis is different in these cells. Megakaryocytic cell lines thought to mimic immature Mks respond to the stable prostacyclin analog iloprost with an expected rise in cAMP but also with a rise in [Ca2+]i. Thus, in these cells Ca2+ responses are insensitive to inhibition by cAMP (14Schwaner I. Seifert R. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,15van der Vuurst H. van Willigen G. van Spronsen A. Hendriks M. Donath J. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1830-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is possible that the cause of this different [Ca2+]i regulation must be sought in the action of PKA. PKA is activated by cAMP through binding to its regulatory subunits. One PKA holoenzyme complex is composed of two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits. Three isoforms of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKA-C) have been characterized and designated the Cα, Cβ, and Cγ isoforms, respectively. They appear on SDS-PAGE as proteins with molecular masses ranging from 41 to 50 (PKA-Cα), from 42 to 50 (PKA-Cβ), and from 39 to 40 kDa (PKA-Cγ) (16Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol.

Four isoforms of the PKA regulatory subunit (PKA-R) have been found and named the RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ isoforms, respectively. They have apparent molecular masses of 49 (PKA-RIα), 54–55 (PKA-RIβ), 51 (PKA-RIIα), and 53 kDa (PKA-RIIβ) (19Foss K.B. Landmark B. Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Jellum E. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PKA is activated by the binding of two cAMP molecules to each of the regulatory subunits, thereby releasing and activating the catalytic subunits. The present study was undertaken to clarify the factors that make cAMP an inhibitor of Ca2+ responses in platelets. Earlier work has shown that immature megakaryocytic cell lines and Mks produce cAMP when stimulated with prostacyclin (15van der Vuurst H. van Willigen G. van Spronsen A. Hendriks M. Donath J.

Nakao K. Blood. 1997; 90: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present results show that PKA is present and functional in stem cells and all stages of megakaryocytopoiesis but does not become an inhibitor of Ca2+ increases before Mk maturation is almost completed and platelets are formed.

The immunomagnetic progenitor cell isolation kit (miniMACS) for the isolation of CD34-positive cells (using QBEND/10 anti-CD34) was from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined by a BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay from Pierce. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Monoclonal anti-CD61 (7F12) and monoclonal anti-CD42b (6.20), which were used for immunomagnetic purification of Mks, were kindly provided by Dr. H. K. Nieuwenhuis, Dept. of Hematology (University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibodies against CD61 (F803) and CD42b (F802) and FITC-labeled negative control IgG, which were used to determine the purity of immunomagnetically purified Mks, and peroxidase-conjugated swine antibody against rabbit IgG (SWARPO) were all from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). FITC-labeled anti-CD34 (HPCA-2), which reacts with a different epitope than the QBEND/10 anti-CD34 antibody that was used in the immunomagnetic isolation, was purchased from BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems.

Donors claimed not to have taken any medication during the preceding 10 days. After informed consent was obtained, freshly drawn venous blood from healthy volunteers was collected into 0.1 volume of 130 mm trisodium citrate. Citrated blood was centrifuged (150 × g, 15 min, 20 °C), and the platelet-rich plasma was collected and used for Ca2+ measurements in intact platelets with Fura-2. For the preparation of washed platelets, platelet-rich plasma was supplemented with prostaglandin I2 (10 ng/ml) and ACD (2.5 g of trisodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and 2.0 g ofd-glucose in 100 ml of distilled water) for acidification to pH 6.5, centrifuged again (330 × g, 15 min, 20 °C), and resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode (HT) buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Na-Hepes, and 0.1% (w/v) glucose, pH 6.5). Umbilical cord blood was collected during normal full-term deliveries with the informed consent of the mother and used within 48 h. CD34+ cells were isolated as described previously (21den Dekker E.

The purity of the CD34+ cells after isolation was determined by FACS analysis (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems) after labeling the cells with FITC-labeled antibody against CD34 (HPCA-2) and was between 95 and 99%. MEG-01, DAMI, and CHRF-288-11 cells were cultured as described earlier (15van der Vuurst H. van Willigen G. van Spronsen A. Hendriks M. Donath J. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1830-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These cell lines represent different stages of Mk maturation. MEG-01 cells resemble immature Mks because they express CD41/CD61 but hardly any CD42b, which is a marker for more mature Mks (22Ogura M. Morishima Y. Ohno R. Kato Y. Hirabayashi N. Nagura H. Saito H. Blood. 1985; 66: 1384-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DAMI cells have the properties of MEG-01 cells but in addition contain CD42b, reflecting a further maturation stage (23Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHRF-288-11 cells represent mature Mks because they have secretion granules in addition to the surface markers present in the immature cell lines (24Fugman D.A. Witte D.P. Jones C.L. Aronow B.J. Lieberman M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1252-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, agonist-induced Ca2+ rises and the expression of certain trimeric G-protein α-subunits show a sequential increase going from MEG-01 to DAMI and CHRF-288-11 (15van der Vuurst H. van Willigen G. van Spronsen A.

Freshly isolated CD34+ cells were cultured in a 12-well culture plate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The initial cell density was 4 × 105 cells/ml of medium. The composition of the medium was the same as described by Zauli et al. (25Zauli G. Gibellini D. Vitale M. Secchiero P. Celeghini C. Bassini A. Pierpaoli S. Marchisio M. Guidotti L. Capitani S. Blood. 1998; 92: 472-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the omission of nucleosides. rhTPO and rhSCF were added to a final concentration of 20 and 50 ng/ml, respectively. After 3 days of culture, 1 ml of fresh medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml rhTPO and 50 ng/ml rhSCF (final concentrations) was added. After 7 and 11 days of culture, 1 ml of fresh culture medium containing 20 ng/ml rhTPO (final concentration) was added. To obtain immature and mature Mks, CD34+ cells were cultured with rhTPO and rhSCF for 7 and 14 days, respectively, as described above. Cells were harvested and washed twice (5 min, 125 × G, 20 °C) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% BSA and 2.5 mm EDTA (buffer A). Subsequently, the cells were labeled for 20 min at 4 °C with mouse-anti-human IgG directed against CD61 (antibody 7F12) for the isolation of immature Mks and against CD42b (antibody 6.20) for the isolation of mature Mks. After washing with buffer A, cells were labeled (20 min, 4 °C) with goat-anti-mouse magnetic microbeads and washed again with buffer A. The cell suspension was brought on a ferromagnetic column, type MS+ (Miltenyi Biotec), and after three washing steps with 700 μl of buffer A each, the retained cells were eluted with buffer A. The purity of the final immature (CD61+) and mature (CD42b+) Mk suspensions was determined by flow cytometry and was typically between 94 and 98%. These populations have been characterized thoroughly in previous studies (26den Dekker E. Molin D.G.M. Breikers G. van Oerle R. Akkerman J.W.N. van Eys G.J.J.M. Heemskerk J.W.M. Biochim. Biophys.

The percentage of CD34-, CD61-, and CD42b-positive cells in the cell population of purified immature Mks was 44.2 ± 6.6, 95.3 ± 1.2, and 25.2 ± 6.5 (mean ± S.D.,n = 3), respectively. The percentage of polyploid cells (≥8 n) in this population was 1.0 ± 0.5. The percentage of CD34-, CD61-, and CD42b-positive cells in the cell population of purified mature Mks was 7.2 ± 2.5, 97.4 ± 1.3, and 95.4 ± 1.3, respectively. A higher percentage of these cells was polyploid (3.0 ± 0.6%) compared with immature Mks. Platelet-rich plasma was supplemented with 3 μm Fura-2/AM and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the dark. The platelet-rich plasma was acidified with ACD (2.5 g of trisodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and 2.0 g ofd-glucose in 100 ml of distilled water) to pH 6.5 and centrifuged again (330 × g, 15 min, 20 °C). Platelets were resuspended in HT buffer (0.1% (w/v) glucose, pH 6.5) to a concentration of 2 × 109/ml and stored at room temperature in the dark. Immediately before the measurement of [Ca2+]i, the platelet suspension was diluted 10 times in prewarmed (37 °C) HT buffer (0.1% glucose, pH 7.4), and GRGDS peptide (100 μm, final concentration) was added to prevent platelet aggregation. Megakaryocytic cell lines, freshly isolated stem cells, and purified immature and mature Mks were pelleted (5 min, 125 g, 20 °C) and resuspended in HT buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (w/v) glucose at a concentration of 5 × 105cells/ml. Fura-2/AM was added to a final concentration of 3 μm, and cells were loaded for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were spun down, resuspended in HT buffer without BSA to a final concentration of 1.6 × 106 cells/ml, and stored at room temperature in the dark. Immediately before the analysis of [Ca2+]i, the cells were resuspended in prewarmed (37 °C) HT buffer to a final concentration of 2 × 105/ml. Measurements were performed at 37 °C with mild stirring (50 rpm) on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Fura-2 fluorescence was measured at 340- (F1) and 380-nm (F2) excitation and 510-nm emission wavelength. [Ca2+]i was calculated using the formula of Grynkiewicz et al. (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Calculations were based on a dissociation constant of the Fura-2-Ca2+ complex of 224 nm. IP3-induced Ca2+mobilization was determined according to a method described previously (29Keularts I.M.L.W. van Gorp R.M.A. Feijge M.A.H. Vuist W.M.J. Heemskerk J.W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1763-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Washed platelets were resuspended in Ca2+-free HT buffer (0.2% glucose, pH 6.5) at a concentration of 5 × 109 platelets/ml. MEG-01 and CHRF-288-11 cells were washed and resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 15 × 107 and 7.5 × 107 cells/ml, respectively. Immediately before the measurements, the 60-μl cell suspension was diluted with 240 μl of a buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 100 mm sucrose, 1.25 mm NaN3, 0.6 μg/ml oligomycin, and 1 μm Fluo-3, pH 7.4. Cells were prewarmed at 37 °C, treated with 1 μm iloprost for 1 min, and subsequently permeabilized with 50 (platelets) or 65 μg/ml (MEG-01 and CHRF-288-11 cells) saponin at 37 °C for 2–5 min until a stable base line was obtained. When necessary, EGTA was added to lower the Ca2+concentration to 350–400 nm, which is an optimal concentration for the measurement of IP3-induced Ca2+ release (29Keularts I.M.L.W. van Gorp R.M.A. Feijge M.A.H.

Subsequently, IP3 (50 nm, final concentration) was added, and changes in fluorescence intensity were monitored at 488-nm excitation and 525-nm emission wavelengths in a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. For the measurement of PKA activation, cells were resuspended in Ca2+-free HT buffer (pH 7.4, 0.1% glucose) to a final concentration of 4 × 105 cells/ml and incubated with iloprost for 10 min at 37 °C with or without preincubation with H89 (15 min, 10 μm, 37 °C). The activity of PKA at different time points was deduced from the mobility shift of VASP on a Western blot caused by PKA-mediated phosphorylation on Ser157 as described elsewhere (30Smolenski A.

Cells were pelleted and lysed in a buffer consisting of 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) octyl glucoside, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS supplemented with 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (1% inhibitor mixture from Sigma; catalog no. P8340). A sample was taken for determination of the protein content with the BCA assay, and a Laemmli electrophoresis sample buffer was added (final concentrations: 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8). Samples were boiled, and 5 μg of protein per lane was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were stained with Ponceau S and scanned, and bands were quantified using ImageQuant from Molecular Dynamics. In all experiments the amount of protein per lane, based on the pixel density of all of the proteins, varied less than 10%. Subsequently, blots were destained with water and blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) supplemented with 2% (w/v) Protifar and 0.5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with antibodies against PKA-C, PKA-RIα/β, PKA-RIIα, or PKA-RIIβ was performed overnight in TBST at 4 °C. The membranes were washed six times with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or anti-mouse antibody for 1 h at 4 °C in TBST. Bands on blot were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, and the intensity of the bands on the film was quantified using ImageQuant. Relative intensities were calculated, and the value for MEG-01 cells (for comparison of different cell lines) or stem cells (for comparison of different stages of megakaryocytopoiesis) was set at 1.00. CHRF cells (1 × 107) were resuspended in 300 μl of Fischer's medium (without serum and penicillin/streptomycin/l-glutamine), transferred to a Gene Pulser cuvette (0.4-cm electrode gap; Bio-Rad), and incubated for 17 min with 12 μg of EGFP-N1 and 41 μg of pCαEV while gently mixing after 10 min. For mock transfection, cells were incubated with 12 μg of EGFP-N1 and 41 μg of Zem3. Electroporation was performed at room temperature in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at 200 V, 950 microfarads, 20–30 ms. Cells were subsequently cultured for 24 h in medium supplemented with 100 μm ZnSO4 to induce PKA-Cα expression. EGFP-positive cells were sorted on a FACSCalibur and analyzed for PKA-C expression by Western blotting. Ca2+ responses were measured in transfected CHRF cells by single cell fluorescence imaging microscopy as described in Ref. 27den Dekker E. Heemskerk J.W.M. Gorter G. van der Vuurst H. Donath J.

In short, transfected CHRF cells were adhered to anti-GPIIIa (7F12) antibody-coated coverslips and loaded with Fura-2/AM. Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded upon stimulation of the cells with iloprost (1 μm) and thrombin (1 unit/ml) as indicated. Subsequently, EGFP fluorescence was determined with a 485-nm excitation filter (half-bandwidth, 22 nm), a 505-nm dichroic long pass filter, and a 530-nm emission filter (half-bandwidth, 30 nm). Ca2+ tracings of EGFP-positive cells were analyzed and averaged (n = 17). Fig. 1 Aillustrates the rapid increase in [Ca2+]i in platelets after stimulation with thrombin (1 unit/ml). Following a subsequent slight decrease, a stable level was maintained for at least 2 min. The addition of the prostacyclin analog iloprost (1 μm) 30 s after the thrombin addition immediately lowered the elevated Ca2+ level to almost basal levels. When platelets were first incubated with iloprost for 1 min and thereafter stimulated with thrombin, the thrombin-induced Ca2+ increase was almost completely abolished (Fig.1 B). These data illustrate the potent inhibition of [Ca2+]i increases by iloprost and confirm earlier observations (5Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Similar experiments in megakaryocytic cell lines (Fig. 2 A), stem cells, and immature and mature Mks (Fig. 2 B) revealed that the effect of iloprost on thrombin-induced Ca2+ signaling was different in these cells. When megakaryocytic cell lines were first stimulated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) and after 3 min treated with iloprost (1 μm), different responses were observed among MEG-01, DAMI, and CHRF 288-11 cells. In MEG-01 cells, thrombin induced a Ca2+ increase of 153 ± 50 nm (mean peak height of Ca2+ increase ± S.D.; n = 3). The subsequent addition of iloprost failed to reduce [Ca2+]i but instead triggered a further rise in the Ca2+ level of 165 ± 30 nm. As we described in detail in another report (27den Dekker E. Heemskerk J.W.M. Gorter G. van der Vuurst H. Donath J. Kroner C. Mikoshiba K. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), this iloprost-induced Ca2+ increase is also found in stem cells. It is caused by an increase in cAMP and further signal generation to the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum via a mechanism that is independent of PKA. In DAMI cells, a first addition of thrombin raised [Ca2+]i by 210 ± 28 nm, which is about 140% of the response observed in MEG-01. The subsequent addition of iloprost again induced a rise in [Ca2+]i, but the increase was only 75 ± 17 nm, which is 45% of the response found in MEG-01. CHRF-288-11 cells also responded to thrombin with a rise in [Ca2+]i, which reached 512 ± 73 nm or 335% of the response by MEG-01 cells. The subsequent addition of iloprost lowered the [Ca2+]i from 200 ± 34 nm to 150 ± 18 nm, which is a reduction of 25%. Together, these findings showed that the maturation of Mks is accompanied by a gradual increase in the capacity of thrombin to raise [Ca2+]i as well as a gradual change in the effect of iloprost shifting from an inducer of [Ca2+]i elevation to an inhibitor of elevated [Ca2+]i. This inhibition is also observed in platelets.Figure 2Effect of thrombin and iloprost on [Ca2+] i in megakaryocytic cell lines, stem cells, and Mks. A, increases in [Ca2+]i after the addition of thrombin (1 unit/ml) and 3 min later iloprost (1 μm) in the human megakaryocytic cell lines MEG-01, DAMI, and CHRF-288-11, representing stages of increasing maturation. B, increases in [Ca2+]i after the addition of thrombin and iloprost in purified human stem cells, immature Mks, and mature Mks. Experimental conditions are the same as described in the legend to Fig.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A similar increase in the thrombin-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i and the change in the effect of iloprost was found when stem cells were compared with immature and mature Mks. In stem cells, thrombin induced a Ca2+ rise of 220 ± 55 nm, which was followed by a further increase induced by iloprost of 78 ± 15 nm. In immature Mks, the thrombin-induced rise of [Ca2+]i had increased to 285 ± 34 nm, which is 130% of the response seen in stem cells. The subsequent addition of iloprost raised [Ca2+]i by 83 ± 22 nm or 113% of the response by stem cells. In mature Mks, thrombin raised [Ca2+]i by 440 ± 35 nm or 200% compared with stem cells, which was followed by a 30% decrease induced by iloprost. Thus, these results in Mk cultures were qualitatively similar to those found in megakaryocytic cell lines and show that the inhibition of Ca2+ signaling by iloprost appears at a late stage in the maturation of Mks. To investigate the inhibition by iloprost prior to stimulation with thrombin, the different cell populations were first treated with iloprost (1 μm) and 1 min later stimulated with thrombin (1 unit/ml). In MEG-01 and DAMI cells (Fig.3 A) and stem cells and immature Mks (Fig. 3 B), iloprost induced a rise in [Ca2+]i. The subsequent addition of thrombin (1 unit/ml) induced a further elevation of [Ca2+]i. Thus, iloprost failed to inhibit the thrombin-induced Ca2+increase in these immature cells. In contrast, in CHRF-288-11 cells and mature Mks there was a weak inhibition of thrombin-induced Ca2+ increases by iloprost amounting to 16 ± 5 and 18 ± 6%, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). A stronger inhibition by iloprost was observed at lower concentrations of thrombin (not shown). Thus, iloprost inhibited Ca2+increases both before and after thrombin stimulation in CHRF-288-11 cells and mature Mks but not in the immature stages of Mk maturation. Multiple steps in agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i are known to be inhibited by cAMP-mediated activation of PKA. Common steps in the signaling pathway"

C., and Mueckler, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 18114–18120). In this present study we have identified, by MALDI mass spectrometry, pp68 as the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of synaptotagmin-binding cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein (SYNCRIP)/NSAP1, a newly discovered cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein. Both SYNCRIP and pp68 were enriched in free polysomes found in low density microsomes isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In vitro phosphorylation studies revealed that SYNCRIP, once extracted from low density microsomes, can be tyrosine phosphorylated using purified insulin receptor. Binding of RNA to SYNCRIP specifically inhibited its in vitro phosphorylation but had no effect on receptor autophosphorylation or on the ability of the receptor to phosphorylate a model substrate, RCM-lysozyme. These results raise the possibility that regulation of mRNA translation or stability by insulin may involve the phosphorylation of SYNCRIP. Recently we reported that osmotic shock increased the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 68-kDa RNA-binding protein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Hresko, R. C., and Mueckler, M. (2000) J. Biol.

Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). The receptor/hormone interaction results in the autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of the receptor's intrinsic tyrosine kinase that can then phosphorylate several known cellular substrates, such as the insulin receptor substrate proteins (2White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), SHC isoforms, Gab-1, Cbl, p60 dok , and adaptor protein containing a PH and SH2domain (3Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated these proteins serve as docking sites for various Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins that are adaptor proteins themselves, kinases, or phosphatases. The result is the initiation of multiple phosphorylation/dephosphorylation signaling pathways that lead to the various pleiotropic responses. Recently we found that osmotic shock enhanced by 10-fold the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 68-kDa protein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (4Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18114-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Further characterization revealed that pp68 was a peripheral protein that resides in a detergent-insoluble fraction of the low-density microsomes (LDM)1 by binding to RNA. Phosphorylation by insulin was maximal by 1 min and was saturated with 50–100 nm insulin. Activation of the p42/44 and p38 MAP kinase pathways by osmotic shock did not affect pp68 phosphorylation. Based on the failure to immunoprecipitate pp68 with antibodies directed against known 60–70 tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and on its phosphorylation characteristics, we speculated that pp68 may be a novel cellular target that lies downstream of the insulin receptor whose ability to bind RNA may be crucial in its physiological function. In the present study we have identified pp68 as the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of SYNCRIP (synaptotagmin-binding cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein), a recently cloned cytoplasmic 66-kDa RNA-binding protein that has been independently shown to interact with ubiquitous synaptotagmins (5Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and be part of a multiprotein complex involved in cytoplasmic RNA turnover (6Grosset C. Chen C.-Y.A., Xu, N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.-B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We report that SYNCRIP can be phosphorylated in vitro by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and that its phosphorylation is regulated by its ability to bind RNA. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown to confluence and 48 h later subjected to differentiation as described previously (7Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 10–14 days after differentiation. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for at least 2 h to overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Adipocytes were then incubated in DMEM alone or DMEM supplemented with insulin or sorbitol. After the treatment, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped in 2 ml per 10-cm dish of ice-cold HES (255 mm sucrose, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 100 mmsodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors, and then homogenized by passing the cells 10 times through a Yamato LSC homogenizer at a speed of 1200 rotations/min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Subcellular fractionation was then carried out on the resulting supernatant essentially as described previously (8Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following protease inhibitors were used: 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with the same medium containing 1 mm Na3VO4. Cells were then treated with DMEM-supplemented with 600 mmsorbitol for 15 min at 37 °C and then 100 nm insulin was added for an additional 5 min. LDM, prepared as described above, were incubated in ice-cold high salt buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 ×g. The salt concentration of the resulting supernatant was then adjusted to 150 mm NaCl. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from 300 10-cm plates worth of high salt-extracted LDM were purified using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody column as previously described (9Keller S.R. Kitagawa K. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. Garner C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12817-12820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins eluted with 3 mm phenyl phosphate were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (v/v, final concentration) and then purified by SDS-PAGE. pp68 was visualized using Coomassie Blue R-250 stain and then excised. Excised pp68 gel pieces were subjected to trypsin digestion with Promega (Madison, WI) sequencing-grade trypsin using a standard procedure developed in the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory (PNACL) at Washington University (St. Louis, MO). The resulting mixture of tryptic peptides was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) with time of flight detection mass spectrometry on a Perseptive Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometry work station. Peptide masses were analyzed with Protein Prospector (University of California, San Francisco) using MS-Fit. This analysis gave an unequivocal protein identification based on a clear distinction of the first MOWSE score relative to all other unrelated ranked proteins. The matched peptide masses represented 21% of the amino acid sequence of the identified protein. This identification was later corroborated by nano-capillary electospray mass spectrometry on a Finnigan (San Jose, CA) LCQ deca ion trap mass spectrometer. Full-length SYNCRIP/NSAP1 cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification using a mouse skeletal muscle Marathon Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) and then subcloned into Bluescript SK+. Antibodies were generated against the same two regions of SYNCRIP as previously described (5Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rabbits were immunized with either a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein corresponding to the NH2-terminal region of SYNCRIP (amino acids 1–170) or with a peptide (amino acids 140–152) cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an artificial NH2-terminal cysteine residue. The peptide-specific antibody was used for immunoblots because this antibody recognized only the denatured form of the protein. The antibody directed against the NH2-terminal region was used in immunoprecipitation studies. 50 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphotyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected using the monoclonal PY-20 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). SYNCRIP was detected using the peptide-specific antibody described above at a 1:500 dilution. 125I-Labeled secondary antibodies (AmershamBiosciences) were visualized by autoradiography. Radioactive bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager SI analyzer (AmershamBiosciences). 0.5 mg of LDM were boiled for 5 min in 1% SDS. Samples were then diluted with 0.5 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors) containing Triton X-100 such that the final Triton X-100:SDS concentration was 10:1. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was incubated overnight with 15 μl of SYNCRIP antibody. 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose was then added for 2 h at 4 °C to the reactions. After washing pellets four times with ice-cold buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and twice with buffer A without detergent, proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using PY-20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies as described above. Free polyribosomes were prepared using a modified procedure of Cardelli and Pitot (10Cardelli J. Long B. Pitot H.C. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 70: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 5–10-cm dishes of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed three times with PBS and incubated for at least 2 h to overnight in serum-free DMEM. Cells were then incubated for 30 min in DMEM alone, or in DMEM supplemented with 100 nm insulin, 600 mmsorbitol, or a combination of insulin and sorbitol. Adipocytes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then three times with ice-cold 0.44 m STKM (sucrose molarity as designated, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm KCl, and 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors. After removal of the buffer, cells were scraped and then disrupted using a ball homogenizer. A post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) was prepared by centrifugation at 13,350 ×g av for 10 min at 4 °C in a TLA-100.3 Beckman rotor. 2 m STKM was added to the PMS to a final sucrose concentration of 1.35 m. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was prepared in a 4-ml sealed polyallomer tube. 1.6 ml of PMS (1.35m) was layered over 1.6 ml of 2 m STKM. 0.44m STKM was then layered on top of the 1.35 mPMS. Samples were centrifuged at 266,000 ×g av for 4.5 h at 4 °C in a NVT 90 Beckman rotor. Free polysomes were found as a clear pellet near the bottom of the tube. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-purified insulin receptor was prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes as previously described (11Flores-Riveros J.R. Sibley E. Kastelic T. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21557-21572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments 0.5 μg of cytoplasmic domain of the β-subunit of the insulin receptor (Calbiochem) were used in the in vitroreactions. SYNCRIP was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of LDM using 15 μl of the glutathione S-transferase fusion SYNCRIP antibody. 1 μm Insulin was added or not for 20 min to an aliquot of wheat germ agglutinin-purified receptor (10 μg of total protein in 0.1% Triton X-100). Receptors were autophosphorylated for 5 min at room temperature in 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.9), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mmmanganese acetate, and 1 mm ATP. Detergent was omitted in the reactions that contained the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor. The activated receptor was then added to the immunoprecipitated SYNCRIP, incubated for 15 min, and then quenched with the addition of EDTA (20 mm final) and SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. In some reactions, RCM-lysozyme (Sigma) was used as a substrate. pp68 is a 68-kDa RNA-binding protein that resides in the LDM of 3T3-L1 adipocytes whose insulin-stimulated phosphorylation is dramatically increased with hypertonic stress (4Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18114-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Based on the elimination of known tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and on the time and concentration dependence of phosphorylation, we previously concluded that pp68 may be a novel substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase whose ability to bind RNA may dictate its physiological function. To identify this protein, pp68 was purified to homogeneity from 300 10-cm dishes of 3T3-L1 adipocytes using phosphotyrosine affinity chromatography and SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified pp68 was excised from Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels, trypsinized, and then analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. pp68 was unequivocally identified as being one of three highly homologous RNA-binding proteins, SYNCRIP, NSAP1, or heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R (hnRNP R). The peptide sequences of SYNCRIP, which represent 21% of the protein, identified by MALDI based on matched peptide masses are shown in TableI. SYNCRIP is a recently cloned cytoplasmic 66-kDa mouse RNA-binding protein that was reported to interact with ubiquitous synaptotagmins (5Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NSAP1 was identified from a two-hybrid screen as a cellular interactor of NS1, the major nonstructural parovirus protein (12Harris C.E. Boden R.A. Astell C.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 72-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 99% amino acid identity between NSAP1 and SYNCRIP indicates that NSAP1 is the human homologue of SYNCRIP. hnRNP R, an 82-kDa protein localized in the nucleoplasm, was identified using autoimmune antibodies (13Hassfeld W. Chan E.K.L. Mathison D.A. Portman D. Dreyfuss G. Steiner G. Tan E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). SYNCRIP is 81.2% identical to hnRNP R but lacks ∼70 carboxyl-terminal amino acids that contain a nuclear localization motif (5Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on similarity in molecular mass and the cytoplasmic localization of pp68, we conclude that pp68 is the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of SYNCRIP/NSAP1 and not that of hnRNP R. Both SYNCRIP/NSAP1 and hnRNP R contain three sets of RNA recognition motifs with well conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 submotifs (5Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, both possess COOH termini enriched in arginine and glycine residues that have seven Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeats. RGG boxes, another type of RNA-binding motif (14Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 15Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Interspersed between several of the RGG repeats were regions enriched in tyrosine and acidic residues that contain three copies of the tetrapeptide YYGY. These tyrosine-rich regions contain several consensus sites for tyrosine phosphorylation in which acidic residues are found on the NH2-terminal side of the tyrosine (2White M.F. Mol. Cell.

Open table in a new tab Purified pp68 was excised from Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels, trypsinized, and then analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. To rule out the possibility that SYNCRIP was an abundant contaminating protein in the pp68 preparation, we immunoprecipitated SYNCRIP from LDM that were first boiled in SDS to disrupt intermolecular interactions, and then analyzed SYNCRIP for phosphotyrosine content by Western blot analysis. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with sorbitol and insulin as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A phosphotyrosine Western blot of isolated LDM (Fig. 1 A) revealed a 68-kDa protein that was weakly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to insulin alone, but whose phosphorylation was greatly enhanced when cells were treated with both insulin and sorbitol. The phosphotyrosine Western blot of immunoprecipitated SYNCRIP (Fig.1 B) gave exactly the same phosphotyrosine pattern observed for pp68 in total LDM. These results indicate that pp68 is the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of SYNCRIP. The same amount of SYNCRIP was immunoprecipitated under all conditions (Fig. 1 C), indicating that the amount of SYNCRIP in the LDM fraction did not change with either sorbitol or insulin treatment. Previously we demonstrated that pp68 resides in a detergent-insoluble fraction of LDM by binding to RNA (4Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18114-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To determine the extraction properties of non-tyrosine-phosphorylated SYNCRIP, LDM from basal cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 or RNase A. The soluble and insoluble fractions were isolated after centrifugation for 1 h at 200,000 ×g. Western blots of the different fractions using SYNCRIP antibodies (Fig. 2) revealed that like pp68, nearly all of the non-phosphorylated SYNCRIP was found in the detergent-insoluble fraction of the LDM and almost all could be released from the LDM with RNase A treatment. Next, we fractionated the adipocytes to determine which intracellular compartments were enriched in SYNCRIP. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 30 min with DMEM alone, or in DMEM supplemented with 100 nm insulin, 600 mm sorbitol, or a combination of insulin and sorbitol and then were fractionated by differential centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blot analyses of the different fractions were carried out using both SYNCRIP and phosphotyrosine antibodies. Because the different treatments had no effect on the subcellular distribution of SYNCRIP and pp68, only the fractionation results using sorbitol- and insulin-treated cells are shown (Fig. 3). SYNCRIP was found highly enriched in LDM and to a lesser extent in high density microsomes (HDM) and the nucleus. The ∼80-kDa protein recognized by the SYNCRIP antibodies in the nuclear fraction is most likely hnRNP R. The phosphotyrosine blot showed that pp68 was highly enriched in LDM and somewhat in HDM. Based on its subcellular localization and on its affinity for RNA, we tested whether SYNCRIP was associated with polysomes. Polysomes are mRNA molecules associated with multiple ribosomes actively synthesizing nascent proteins. These RNA-protein complexes are membrane-bound in HDM (16Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and free in solution in LDM. 2R. C. Hresko and M. Mueckler, unpublished observation. Free polysomes were isolated from basal, insulin, sorbitol, or sorbitol and insulin-treated adipocytes using high speed centrifugation through a 2 msucrose cushion as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then analyzed for SYNCRIP protein by Western blot analysis (Fig.4 A). SYNCRIP was enriched about 7.5-fold in free polysomes isolated from basal or insulin-treated cells compared with that in total lysates. There was approximately half the amount of SYNCRIP found in free polysomes from sorbitol ± insulin-treated cells. This is consistent with the fact that hypertonic stress is known to dissociate ribosomes from free polysomes (17Wengler G. Wengler G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 27: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Saborio J.L. Pong S.-S. Koch G. J. Mol. Biol. 1874; 85: 195-211Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). SYNCRIP/NSAP1 has been reported to be part of a multiprotein complex that includes both poly(A)-binding protein and poly(A)-binding protein-interacting protein (PAIP-1) (6Grosset C. Chen C.-Y.A., Xu, N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.-B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Like SYNCRIP, PAIP-1 was enriched in free polysomes (5.1-fold) isolated from basal or insulin-treated cells (Fig. 4 A). Sorbitol treatment dramatically reduced the amount of PAIP-1 in the free polysomes. Our attempts to co-immunoprecipitate PAIP-1 and SYNCRIP in our system, however, were unsuccessful (data not shown). The ribosomal protein S6 was enriched 58-fold in free polysomes, illustrating the extent of purity of our free polysome preparation. The quantity of S6 protein in free polysomes did not change with sorbitol treatment, indicating that when free polysomes are dissociated by osmotic shock ribosomes can still be pelleted through a 2 m sucrose cushion, whereas proteins that associate with mRNA like SYNCRIP and PAIP-1 cannot. To determine whether pp68 was also found in free polysomes, SYNCRIP was immunoprecipitated from free polysomes isolated from each of the treated cells and then analyzed for phosphotyrosine content by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 B). Like SYNCRIP, pp68 was also associated with free polysomes. The relative amounts of SYNCRIP immunoprecipitated in each of the reactions are shown for comparison (Fig. 4 B, bottom panel). Our initial study characterizing the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of pp68 suggested that SYNCRIP could be a direct substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (4Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18114-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, SYNCRIP was immunoprecipitated from LDM prepared from basal or sorbitol-treated cells and used as a substrate for the insulin receptor in an in vitro phosphorylation reaction (Fig.5 A). No detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of SYNCRIP was observed. Extraction of SYNCRIP from the LDM by RNase treatment or with 600 mm NaCl prior to its immunoprecipitation resulted in a robust tyrosine phosphorylation of SYNCRIP in the in vitro reaction. No difference in phosphorylation was observed between SYNCRIP purified from basal or sorbitol-treated cells under these conditions. SYNCRIP was not phosphorylated by the insulin receptor if SYNCRIP was immunoprecipitated from cytosol prepared from either basal or sorbitol-treated cells. The relative amounts of SYNCRIP immunoprecipitated from each of the LDM samples were identical, although the amount purified from the cytosol was significantly less than that purified from LDM (Fig. 5 B). Based on the result that extracting SYNCRIP from the LDM with RNase treatment increased its phosphorylation by the insulin receptor, we tested whether the addition of RNA to the in vitrophosphorylation reaction could specifically inhibit SYNCRIP phosphorylation. LDM was first treated with 600 mm NaCl to extract SYNCRIP from LDM. After the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the salt concentration diluted to 150 mmNaCl, SYNCRIP was immunoprecipitated and used as a substrate in thein vitro phosphorylation reaction. The addition of poly(A) RNA completely abrogated insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SYNCRIP (Fig. 6). In contrast, autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its ability to phosphorylate a model substrate, RCM-lysozyme, in an insulin-dependent manner was not significantly affected by poly(A) RNA. In the present study we have identified pp68 as being the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of SYNCRIP/NSAP1 by MALDI mass spectrometry. SYNCRIP is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that has been reported to interact with ubiquitous synaptotagmins (5Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the significance of this association is not known, the authors (5Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) of this particular study proposed that non-neuronal synaptotagmins could be involved in organelle-based mRNA transport through its interaction with SYNCRIP. Our results, however, showed that SYNCRIP and pp68 were predominantly localized to LDM through their RNA binding (Fig. 2) and not through their interaction with an integral membrane protein such as synaptotagmin. Therefore, we decided not to focus our attention on the association between SYNCRIP and synaptotagmins in our system. Further characterization of the localization of SYNCRIP revealed that both SYNCRIP and its phosphorylated form, pp68, were found enriched in free polysomes (Fig. 4). mRNAs are translated in circular form. Recent evidence indicates that the association between the cap structure (m7GpppX, where Xrepresents any nucleotide) of the 5′ terminus and the 3′ poly(A) tail is required for efficient translation initiation (19Gallie D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The cap, which directs the translation machinery to the 5′ end, binds to the eIF4F complex. eIF4F is a three-component complex comprising the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A, and eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein which interacts with ribosome-associated eIF3, eIF4E, and eIF4A. The actual linkage between the two termini in mammalian cells is thought to be through PAIP-1, a protein that simultaneously interacts with poly(A)-binding protein and eIF4A (21Craig A.W.B. Haghighat A., Yu, A.T.K. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1998; 392: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Loss of the 3′ poly(A) tail greatly reduces the rate of translation (20Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 22Munroe D. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting efficient translation initiation, the interaction between the two termini is important in maintaining the integrity of an mRNA (19Gallie D.R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Proteins that bind to the poly(A) tail and the 5′ cap are thought to protect mRNA from deadenylation and decapping (23Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), events which precede the 5′ to 3′-exonucleolytic degradation of the mRNAs (24Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Short half-live mRNAs contain adenylate, uridylate-rich (AU-rich) instability elements (25Chen C.Y. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar) in their 3′-untranslated regions, as well as regions of instability within the protein-coding region (23Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that regulate the removal of the poly(A) tail. SYNCRIP/NSAP1 along with Unr, a purine-rich RNA-binding protein, poly(A)-binding protein, PAIP-1, and hnRNP D, an AU-rich element-binding protein have been reported to form a multiprotein complex that binds to the major protein-coding region determinant of instability of c-fos (6Grosset C. Chen C.-Y.A., Xu, N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.-B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that formation of this complex would bridge the poly(A) tail and the major protein-coding region determinant of instability and perhaps stabilize the mRNA and that transit of the ribosome might disrupt or reorganize the complex and lead to the deadenylation and subsequent degradation of the mRNA. Contrary to this published report (6Grosset C. Chen C.-Y.A., Xu, N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.-B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate SYNCRIP from an RNase A-treated lysate using an antibody directed against PAIP-1 even though we could demonstrate efficient PAIP-1 immunoprecipitation (data not shown). We did, however co-localize SYNCRIP and PAIP-1 to polysomes, suggesting that these proteins may associate with the same mRNA but in an indirect manner at least in our system. In our initial study (4Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18114-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we proposed that p68 (SYNCRIP) could be a direct substrate of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. In vitro phosphorylation studies revealed that SYNCRIP, once extracted from the LDM, could be directly phosphorylated using purified insulin receptor, whereas SYNCRIP isolated from cytosol was poorly phosphorylated (Fig. 5). Binding of RNA specifically inhibited insulin-stimulated SYNCRIP phosphorylation in vitro but had no effect on receptor autophosphorylation or on the ability of the receptor to phosphorylate RCM-lysozyme (Fig. 6). Previously we reported that both osmotic shock and arsenite treatment greatly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of SYNCRIP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (4Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18114-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is also known that osmotic stress and arsenite treatment rapidly blocks protein synthesis at the initiation step leading to the formation of 80S monoribosomes that are free of mRNA (17Wengler G. Wengler G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 27: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Saborio J.L. Pong S.-S. Koch G. J. Mol. Biol. 1874; 85: 195-211Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The dramatic reduction by sorbitol treatment in the amount of SYNCRIP and PAIP-1 but not ribosomal S6 protein that could be pelleted through a 2m sucrose cushion (Fig. 4) confirmed this observation. Our working hypothesis based on the phosphorylation results is the following. SYNCRIP can be phosphorylated by the insulin receptor when it is not bound to RNA. Osmotic shock and arsenite treatment leads to the dissociation of free polysomes and increases the amount of RNA-free SYNCRIP in the cell. Our failure to observe a difference in tyrosine phosphorylation between SYNCRIP samples isolated from cytosol prepared from either basal or sorbitol-treated cells most likely indicates that during the homogenization/subcellular fractionation procedure using sucrose-containing buffers, free SYNCRIP can reassociate with RNA. SYNCRIP is not the first reported hnRNP protein phosphorylated in response to extracellular signals. hnRNP A1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus but can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (26Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Osmotic shock and UVC irradiation induces the serine phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 via the p38 MAP kinase pathway and causes a redistribution of hnRNP A1 to the cytoplasm (27van der Houven van Oordt W. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Krainer A.R. Moscat J. Caceres J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). hnRNP K, a protein that can recruit RNA, DNA, Vav, transcriptional repressors, and inducible kinases (28Bomsztyk K. Van Seuningen I. Suzuki H. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) has been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in both cell culture and in mouse liver treated with H2O2 and vanadate (29Ostrowski J. Schullery D.S. Denisenko O.N. Higaki Y. Watts J. Aebersold R. Stempka L. Gschwendt M. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Denisenko O.N. Stempka L. Shnyreva M. Suzuki H. Gschwendt M. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and Src kinase (29Ostrowski J. Schullery D.S. Denisenko O.N. Higaki Y. Watts J. Aebersold R. Stempka L. Gschwendt M. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3619-3628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). More recently, insulin has been shown to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of hnRNP K in hepatocytes (33Ostrowski J. Kawata Y. Schullery D.S. Denisenko O.N. Higaki Y. Abrass C.K. Bomsztyk K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9044-9049Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on its phosphorylation characteristics and on its diverse set of molecular interactions, protein K might serve as a docking site to recruit signaling molecules involved in insulin-directed nucleic acid processes. The significance of SYNCRIP phosphorylation is presently not known due in part to the lack of a clear functional role for SYNCRIP within the cell. hnRNPs are important in mRNA metabolism both inside the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (34Shyu A.-B. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Based on subcellular fractionation, SYNCRIP was enriched in both LDM and nuclear fractions (Fig. 3) and therefore like hnRNP A1 may shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm where pp68 is found, hnRNPs are known to regulate mRNA localization, mRNA translation, and mRNA turnover (34Shyu A.-B. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Similar to other hnRNPs, SYNCRIP has been implicated in several different aspects of mRNA metabolism such as mRNA vesicular transport (5Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and regulating c-fos mRNA turnover (6Grosset C. Chen C.-Y.A., Xu, N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.-B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The functional roles for SYNCRIP in these reports, however, are more speculative than conclusive. Both SYNCRIP and pp68 are predominantly localized to LDM by binding RNA (Fig. 2) and although SYNCRIP can bind preferentially to poly(A) resins in vitro, the actual sequence of RNA it binds in vivo is not known. In addition to possessing three sets of RNA recognition motifs, SYNCRIP has seven RGG boxes, another type of RNA-binding motif that is also involved in protein-protein interactions (15Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Interspersed between the RGG boxes are several consensus-type sites for tyrosine phosphorylation. RNA-binding proteins not only bind RNA, they can interact with other RNA-binding proteins to form multiprotein complexes as has been previously reported for SYNCRIP (6Grosset C. Chen C.-Y.A., Xu, N. Sonenberg N. Jacquemin-Sablon H. Shyu A.-B. Cell. 2000; 103: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation, therefore, could either affect the affinity of SYNCRIP to bind a specific sequence of RNA or modify its ability to associate with other binding proteins. Insulin is known to regulate both mRNA translation and stability (35O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1110-1145Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis is globally induced severalfold with insulin, whereas some individual mRNAs are regulated more dramatically. Insulin can destabilize mRNAs encoding some proteins including: PEPCK, GLUT4, and glycogen synthase, whereas stabilize other messages such as for GLUT1, glycerol-3-phospate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, and phosphorylase (35O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1110-1145Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Similar to the recent findings for hnRNP K, it is possible that the phosphorylation of SYNCRIP could be involved in the regulation of mRNA translation or mRNA turnover by insulin. We thank Dr. N. Sonenberg for kindly providing PAIP-1 antibody.

Calpain binds to the N-terminal region of DNA ligase III, which contains an acidic proline, aspartate, serine, and threonine (PEST) domain frequently present in proteins cleaved by calpain. Recombinant DNA ligase III was a substrate for calpain degradation in vitro. This calpain-mediated proteolysis was calcium-dependent and was blocked by the specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin. Western blot analysis revealed that DNA ligase III was degraded in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells following exposure to γ-radiation. The degradation of DNA ligase III was prevented by pretreatment with calpeptin, which protected irradiated cells from death. Calpeptin treatment also blocked 9-amino camptothecin-induced DNA ligase III proteolysis and simultaneously protected the cells from death. HT1080 clones expressing a modified DNA ligase III that lacked a recognizable PEST domain were significantly more resistant to killing by γ-radiation or 9- amino camptothecin than were cells that overexpressed the wild-type form of DNA ligase III.

While this process was discovered during studies of development, apoptosis also plays a critical role in a number of processes that occur in the adult organism, including tissue homeostasis and elimination of virus-infected and tumor cells (1Arends M.J.

Phys. 2001; 49: 1157-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A key feature of apoptosis is the induction of intracellular protease activity. Biochemical and genetic studies have determined that proteolytic cleavage of key cellular proteins by these enzymes is an essential process in the apoptotic pathway (10Stroh C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 997-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 11Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). The most studied of these proteases belong to the caspase gene family and are encoded by homologs of the Caenorhabditis elegans ced 3 gene (1Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp.

However mammalian apoptosis also involves the activation of proteases encoded by the cathepsin (13Deiss L.P. Galinka H. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3861-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and calpain gene families (14Sarin A. Adams D.H. Henkart P.A. J. Exp.

Activation of members of the caspase and cathepsin gene families occurs via proteolytic cleavage of inactive zymogen forms (11Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev.

In contrast, activation of calpains requires elevated levels of cellular calcium (Ca2+), although these proteins are further activated, and have their Ca2+requirement reduced by autolysis that occurs following the initial Ca2+-dependent activation (18Suzuki K.

Proteases involved in apoptosis appear to hydrolyze target proteins at a limited number of specific recognition sites. For example, most members of the caspase family cleave proteins at the C-terminal end of a 4-amino acid sequence containing a terminal aspartic acid residue (11Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar, 22Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar), whereas calpains specifically cleave proteins containing regions rich in proline, aspartate, serine, and threonine residues called PEST1 motifs (23Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 24Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage can activate the target protein, as in the case of autolysis of calpains, caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease, or MEKK-1 kinase (25Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C.

During apoptosis triggered by DNA damage, caspase 3 hydrolyzes a number of proteins involved in DNA damage recognition and repair. For example, the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase is cleaved by caspase 3 following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) (36Song Q. Lees-Miller S.P. Kumar S. Zhang Z. Chan D.W. Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (37McGinnis K.M. Gnegy M.E. Park Y.H. Mukerjee N. Wang K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein (38Tong X. Liu B. Dong Y. Sun Z. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) are cleaved by this enzyme in cells exposed to IR. The Bloom syndrome protein is cleaved by caspase 3 in Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis induced by a topoisomerase inhibitor (39Freire R. d'Adda Fagagna F., Wu, L. Pedrazzi G. Stagljar I. Hickson I.D. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3172-3180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that the DNA repair enzyme Rad51 is cleaved by caspase 3 in cells that have been exposed to γ-radiation (40Huang Y. Nakada S. Ishiko T. Utsugisawa T. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Yoshida K. Talanian R.V. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2986-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells that overexpressed a protease-resistant form of Rad51 were resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IR, suggesting that the DNA repair activity mediated by this enzyme could antagonize the cell death signal, thereby promoting cellular survival (40Huang Y. Nakada S. Ishiko T. Utsugisawa T. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Yoshida K. Talanian R.V. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2986-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This hypothesis suggests that other DNA repair enzymes are likely to be degraded in response to treatment with DNA-damaging agents and that alleles of genes that encode protease-resistant versions of these proteins could protect cells from death induced by these agents. The results described herein support this hypothesis. We demonstrate that DNA ligase III is a substrate for calpain-mediated proteolysis. Calpain binding to and degradation of DNA ligase III is dependent upon a PEST (23Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 24Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) sequence that is present in the N-terminal portion of the latter protein. We further determined that calpain degrades DNA ligase III during cell death induced by a number of DNA-damaging agents and that expression of a recombinant DNA ligase III protein that was resistant to calpain-mediated proteolysis protected cells from killing by these agents. These findings suggest that calpain-mediated proteolysis of DNA ligase III plays an essential role in DNA damage-induced cell death. Escherichia coli DH10B cells were used for subcloning of cDNA and for amplification of plasmids recovered from yeast. For yeast two-hybrid system screening the reporter strains PJ69-2A (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1 UAS - GAL1 TATA -HIS3, GAL2 UAS -GAL2 TATA -ADE2) and Y187 (MATα, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, met−, URA3::GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -lacZ) were used. Human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells (41Rasheed S. Nelson-Rees W.A. Toth E.M. Arnstein P. Gardner M.B. Cancer (Phila.). 1974; 33: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The two-hybrid vector pAS2-1 containing the binding domain of Gal4 was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The human cDNA of DNA ligase III and different fragments of DNA ligase III were cloned in-frame with the DNA binding domain of Gal4 into pAS2-1. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to amplify nucleotides 73–3102 of the human DNA ligase III cDNA from HT1080 cells (the nucleotide positions are based on the DNA ligase III cDNA sequence from GenBankTM). 2The nucleotide sequence for the human DNA ligase III was deposited in GenBankTM under accession numberAAA85022. A second round of PCR was used to create a DNA ligase III minigene encoding a 3′-hemagglutinin (HA) tag (42Lakshmipathy U. Campbell C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3869-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This minigene was cloned into pAS2-1 to create the pAS-FL vector. The pAS-A vector was created by cloning nucleotides 73–2433 of DNA ligase III into pAS2-1. The pAS-B vector was created by cloning nucleotides 1411–2293 of DNA ligase III into pAS2-1. Nucleotides 2433–3102 of DNA ligase III were cloned into pAS2-1 to create the vector pAS-C. The vector pAS-MOD was created by subcloning nucleotides 73–2433 of the DNA ligase III cDNA with the modified PEST sequence into pAS2-1. The full-length cDNA of wild-type and PEST-modified DNA ligase III were cloned into the pREP4 vector (Invitrogen) to create the pREP-WT and the pREP-MOD plasmids, respectively. A pretransformed Matchmaker human cDNA liver library cloned into pACT2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with the pAS-FL as bait. β-Galactosidase filter assays and rescue of plasmids from yeast clones into bacterial host were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. HT1080 cells were transfected via electroporation (43Keown W.A. Campbell C.R. Kucherlapati R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and stable transfectants were isolated based on their antibiotic resistance. Northern blot analyses were performed on clones that express DNA ligase III RNA. Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/100-mm plate. Twenty four hours later, cells were either pretreated with calpeptin (100 μm; Calbiochem) or Me2SO (calpeptin vehicle) for 1 h at 37 °C. After preincubation the cells were either exposed to 5 Gy of γ-radiation (IR) in a 137Cs irradiator or to 10 μm camptothecin (9AC; Calbiochem) in Me2SO. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method after 0, 2, and 4 h. Hygromycin-resistant HT1080 cells overexpressing the WT or the PEST-modified DNA ligase III alleles were used. Hygromycin-resistant HT1080 cells overexpressing the WT DNA ligase III allele were treated with 100 μm calpeptin for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then trypsinized, resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in cold serum-free media, and exposed to 0, 1.25, or 2.5 Gy of radiation from a137Cs source. Four hundred cells were then plated on 10-cm dishes seeded with a feeder layer of hygromycin-sensitive HT1080 cells. Cells were incubated in media containing hygromycin and cultured for 14 days. Colonies were counted by staining with 0.8% crystal violet in methanol (Sigma), and the ability to survive treatment was calculated by comparison to unirradiated controls. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HT1080 cells as described previously (42Lakshmipathy U. Campbell C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3869-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214131) Google Scholar), and bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) was used as standard. Whole cell lysates were prepared from HT1080 cells. Cells were collected by scraping and incubated on ice for 10 min in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 500 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5% glycerol. Lysates were then sonicated on ice (3 bursts for 15 s) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay. DNA ligase III cDNA was transcribed and translated during a 90-min incubation at 30 °C in TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) using 2 μg of DNA. The TnT reaction mixture (15 μl), 20 μg of nuclear extract, or 30 μg of whole cell lysate were incubated in calpain reaction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1.5 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence or absence of 750 μm CaCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 μg of purified human calpain, or 520 nm calpeptin (Calbiochem). Samples were brought to a final volume of 40 μl and following incubation at 30 °C for 30 min were placed on ice, and the reaction was terminated by addition of SDS gel-loading buffer (see below). Electrophoresis was performed using a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analysis was performed as described below. Samples in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol, were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and incubated for several hours in a solution of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% BSA. This blocking solution was removed, and membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody, either a mouse polyclonal anti-DNA ligase III antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), which recognizes amino acids 1–862 of DNA ligase III used at a 1:1000 dilution, or a rat monoclonal anti-HA high affinity antibody (clone 3F10; Roche Diagnostics) used at a 1:250 dilution. The membrane was then washed three times with 0.1% BSA in TBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-mouse or anti-rat IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:5000 dilution; Sigma). The membrane was then washed 3 times for 5 min each with TBS and 0.1% BSA. After the final wash the membrane was incubated with water containing alkaline phosphatase substrate (SigmaFast, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium, Sigma). The reaction was stopped by rinsing the membrane with water, and the blot was scanned and quantified with the Molecular Analyst program. The sequence spanning amino acids 145–158 (KPNNSGEAPSSPTP) of DNA ligase III was recognized as a PEST sequence by the PEST-FIND algorithm developed by Rogers and colleagues (45Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar) (www.at.embnet.org/ htbin/embnet/PESTfind). Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of the PEST sequence of human DNA ligase III was performed using the method of Kunkel et al. (46Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4545) Google Scholar). Mutagenic oligonucleotides were used to alter the coding region corresponding to the PEST domain of DNA ligase III. The modified cDNA encoded a DNA ligase III protein in which serine and threonine residues present in the PEST region (KPNNSGEASSPTP) were replaced by alanines (KPNNAGEAPAAPPAP). In the process a new SacII restriction site was created. Clones bearing the desired modifications were identified by restriction digest using SacII and by DNA sequence analysis. This modified DNA ligase III cDNA was subcloned into the pAS2-1 vector, creating plasmid pAS-MOD. Yeast were then co-transformed with this plasmid and pACT-CAL, the calpain-encoding plasmid identified in the original screen. HT1080 cells expressing the WT or PEST-modified DNA ligase III were transiently transfected (Superfect; Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) with a vector encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Following a 48-h incubation, the cells were exposed to 5 Gy of IR or were mock-irradiated. One, two, and four hours later fluorescent photomicroscopy was performed. The samples were coded to eliminate biased scoring, and 100 cells were examined to determine the relative percentage of living (flat, adherent) and dying (rounded, shrunken) cells present before and after irradiation. The results presented in Fig. 7 were obtained by subtracting the former value from the latter. A full-length cDNA of the human DNA ligase III gene was used as “bait” in a yeast two-hybrid experiment. Slightly more than 2 million yeast transformants expressing clones obtained from a human cDNA liver library were screened to identify potential DNA ligase III-binding proteins. One of the positive clones harbored a cDNA that upon sequence analysis was found to encode a portion of the small subunit of the calcium-dependent protease calpain (amino acids 142–268). 3The amino acid sequence for the human calpain small subunit can be accessed through NCBI Protein Database under accession number P04632. To determine the calpain-binding region of the DNA ligase III protein, different fragments of the DNA ligase III cDNA were subcloned into the two-hybrid vector pAS2-1 thereby creating a series of ligase III-Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion genes (pAS-FL, pAS-A, pAS-B, and pAS-C; see “Experimental Procedures”). As Fig.1 A illustrates, the different cDNA fragments encode one or more of the domains known to be present in the DNA ligase III protein. Plasmids encoding these fusion proteins were co-transformed into yeast that expressed the Gal4-calpain regulatory subunit “prey” fusion protein that was identified in the original two-hybrid screen (encoded by plasmid pACT-CAL). As Fig.1 B indicates, bait-prey interactions were only detected in clones that expressed either the full-length DNA ligase III or construct A, indicating that a calpain-binding domain of DNA ligase III is located within the N-terminal portion of the protein. Many known calpain substrates contain a so-called PEST domain (23Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 24Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). PEST domains are regions of a protein rich in proline, glutamate/aspartate, serine, and threonine residues that are flanked by basic amino acid residues. The computer algorithm PEST-Score can be used to determine whether a particular protein contains a PEST sequence. The algorithm assigns a score to any PEST sequence identified, and a PEST score greater than 0 suggests that the protein is a likely calpain substrate (45Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). Computer analysis revealed the presence of a PEST sequence spanning amino acid residues 145–158 (single letter amino acid code: KPNNSGEAPSSPTP, Fig. 1 A) of DNA ligase III. The PEST score for this sequence was +10.47, indicating a strong likelihood that this is an authentic PEST domain. Interestingly, this PEST sequence is located within the portion of the DNA ligase III protein that interacts with calpain in the yeast two-hybrid analysis. A series of experiments were performed to determine whether DNA ligase III is a substrate for calpain-dependent proteolysis.First, nuclear protein extracts from human HT1080 cells were incubated with calpain under a variety of conditions, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and DNA ligase III levels monitored by Western blot analysis using an anti-DNA ligase III antibody. As Fig.2 A indicates, although addition of calpain alone had no effect on DNA ligase III, addition of calcium (750 μm) plus calpain resulted in complete degradation of DNA ligase III. As would be expected, when EGTA (a calcium chelator) was included along with calcium and calpain, no proteolysis of DNA ligase III was observed. Interestingly, addition of calcium alone also resulted in partial proteolysis of DNA ligase III, indicating that HT1080 cells possess an endogenous calcium-dependent protease that is capable of degrading DNA ligase III. Similar experiments were performed using nuclear protein extracts prepared from a HT1080 cell line that overexpressed an HA-tagged DNA ligase III gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). As Fig.2 B indicates, the HA-tagged DNA ligase III protein present in extracts prepared from these cells was degraded in the presence of calcium and calpain. When the specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin was included in the reaction, DNA ligase III was protected from degradation. As was seen with the endogenous DNA ligase III, addition of calcium alone resulted in partial degradation of the HA-tagged DNA ligase III protein. The results presented in Fig. 2, A and B, are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA ligase III is a substrate for calpain proteolysis. However, these results also support the hypothesis that addition of calpain activates a second protease that cleaves DNA ligase III. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, recombinant DNA ligase III was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation and was incubated with calpain in the presence or absence of calcium. As Fig. 2 C shows, addition of calpain and 750 μm calcium resulted in DNA ligase III degradation. This effect was blocked by addition of EGTA or calpeptin. These results indicate that DNA ligase III is a calpain substrate. This finding in turn suggests that the degradation of DNA ligase III observed in Fig.2, A and B, is likely due to the direct action of calpain. However, these results do not rule out the possibility that other proteases could be responsible for the calpain-dependent degradation of DNA ligase III shown in Fig. 2, A and B. The results presented thus far are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA ligase III binds to and is degraded by calpain due to the presence of a PEST domain near the N terminus of the protein. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to modify the portion of the HA-tagged DNA ligase III cDNA that encoded the PEST sequence. The resulting cDNA encoded a modified DNA ligase III protein in which three of the serine residues and the threonine residue within the DNA ligase III PEST domain were replaced by alanine residues (see the “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis by PEST score indicated that the DNA ligase III protein encoded by this mutant cDNA did not possess a recognizable PEST domain. The modified DNA ligase III cDNA was cloned into an appropriate vector (pAS-MOD), and a two-hybrid analysis was performed in a yeast strain that expressed the calpain prey clone isolated from the original screen. As a control, a parallel experiment was performed with a yeast clone expressing the wild-type (WT) DNA ligase III cDNA (pAS-A). Although there was a robust interaction between the calpain fragment and the WT DNA ligase III, there was no detectable interaction between calpain and the DNA ligase III protein containing the modified PEST sequence (data not shown). Western blot analysis revealed that the respective yeast transformant clones harbored similar levels of the WT and PEST-modified form of DNA ligase III, suggesting that lack of interaction between calpain and the PEST-modified DNA ligase III was not due to instability of the latter protein (data not shown). Surprisingly, it has not yet been shown directly that PEST sequences are directly involved in the binding of calpain to any of its substrate molecules. However, the results described above suggest that binding of calpain to DNA ligase III is dependent upon a functional PEST sequence, which is not present on the modified DNA ligase III clone. One clear prediction of this model is that the modified DNA ligase III protein should be less sensitive to calpain-mediated degradation than is the WT DNA ligase III protein. To test this hypothesis, extracts were prepared from HT1080 cells expressing WT and modified (MOD) DNA ligase III proteins. These extracts were then incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of calpain and calcium, and Western blot analysis was performed using an a"

Elongin is composed of a transcriptionally active A subunit and two small regulatory B and C subunits, the latter binding stably to each other to form a binary complex that interacts with Elongin A and strongly induces its transcriptional activity. To further understand the role of Elongin A in transcriptional regulation by RNA polymerase II, we are attempting to identify Elongin A-related proteins. Here, we report on the molecular cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of human Elongin A3, a novel transcription elongation factor that exhibits 49 and 81% identity to Elongin A and the recently identified Elongin A2, respectively. The mRNA of Elongin A3 is ubiquitously expressed, and the protein is localized to the nucleus of cells. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that Elongin A3 possesses similar biochemical features to Elongin A2. Both stimulate the rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II and are capable of forming a stable complex with Elongin BC. In contrast to Elongin A, however, their transcriptional activities are not activated by Elongin BC. Structure-function analyses using fusion proteins composed of Elongin A3 and Elongin A revealed that the COOH-terminal region of Elongin A is important for the activation by Elongin BC."

Such a result suggested that the mode of metal ion coordination in the Ty3 RNase H domain might differ from the extensively characterized retroviral enzymes. Sequence alignment shows that a conserved histidine and a cluster of four carboxylate residues constitute the -D-E-D-H-D- motif common to the catalytic site of both retroviral and prokaryotic RNases H (12Dyda F.

Biochemical studies with HIV-1 andE. coli RNases H have indicated that only the first three carboxylate residues are critical for catalysis. Replacing HIV-1 His-539 and E. coli His-124 with Asn, Asp, or Ala only reduces RNase H activity (17Kanaya S. Kohara A. Miura Y. Sekiguchi A. Iwai S. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Ikehara M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the -H-D- component of the -D-E-D-H-D- motif can assist catalysis but are dispensable. In view of the sequence similarities between retroviral and retrotransposon RNases H, a surprising observation was the presence of tyrosine (Tyr-459) in the Ty3 RNase H domain at a position generally occupied by histidine. A contribution of His-124 of E. coli RNase H to catalysis has been proposed (15Haruki M. Tsunaka Y. Morikawa M. Iwai S. Kanaya S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13939-13944Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Kashiwagi T. Jeanteur D. Haruki M. Katayanagi K. Kanaya S. Morikawa K. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Oda Y. Yoshida M. Kanaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it was not immediately clear how this function might be fulfilled by tyrosine in the retrotransposon enzyme without invoking its activation by a nearby acidic residue. However, a compilation of RNase H sequences from the gypsy group of retrotransposons (8Rausch J.W., Le Grice M.K. Nymark-McMahon H.M. Miller J.T. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13879-13887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) suggested a conserved histidine immediately adjacent to one of the catalytic carboxylate residues (Asp-426) might be implicated in catalysis, leading to our proposal of a -D-E-DH-Y-D- motif (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly however, a recent phylogenetic compilation of RNase H sequences from LTR- and non-LTR-containing elements suggests that retrotransposon enzymes may lack the flexible “His loop” of retroviral and bacterial enzymes (13Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B), which may result in decreased RNase H activity. The same paper also indicates that although the DNA polymerase domains Ty3/gypsy elements and retroviruses are closely related, their RNase H domains display much greater divergence. Such findings open the possibility that the retrotransposon RNase H domain could function in the absence of a “His loop,” and that Y459 of Ty3 RT need not be directly involved in catalysis. Thus, a more detailed biochemical analysis of the evolutionarily conserved residues of the Ty3 RNase H domain is clearly warranted. In this paper, we investigated the role of several residues in the catalytic site of Ty3 RT-RNase H using purified, recombinant enzymes, in addition to monitoring transposition of the Ty3 element containing these mutations. Of the conserved carboxylate residues, RNase H activity is eliminated by replacement of Asp-358, Glu-401, and Asp-426 with their amidated counterpart, whereas the equivalent replacement of Asp-469 only partially reduced activity. Reduced activity was also noted for mutants H427A and Y459A. In contrast to our biochemical observations, all mutations prevented Ty3 transposition. Further evaluation of mutants H427A, Y459A, and D469N indicated that they failed to support two specific events in Ty3 transposition, namely DNA strand transfer and processing of the (+) strand PPT primer. Taken together, our data suggest that although the Asp-358/Glu-401/Asp-426 triad constitutes the biologically relevant metal binding site and is indispensable for RNase H function, His-427, Tyr-459, and Asp-469 may be more important in position the substrate for specific cleavage events. Differences in RNase H activity between Ty3 and HIV-1 RT were also observed when Mn2+ was substituted for Mg2+ as the divalent cation, suggesting differences in the mode of metal ion coordination between retrotransposon and retroviral enzymes. E. coli andS. cerevisiae strains were cultured and transformed by standard methods. S. cerevisiae yTM443 (23Menees T.M. Sandmeyer S.B. Mol. Cell.

Chalker D.L. Sandmeyer S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5245-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), was used for transposition assays, and protein analyses. E. coli CJ236 (New England Biolabs) (F′cat ( = pCJ105; M13sCmr)/dut ung-1 thi-1 relA1 spoT1 mcrA) was used for production of single-stranded DNA for site-directed mutagenesis (25Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). The C-terminal Ty3 RNase H domain (residues 341–476) was modeled using the RNase H domain of p66 HIV-1 RT (PDB 1HYS, residues 427–553) as the reference protein. The Ty3 structure was generated using the Modeler function within the Homology module of InsightII (Accelrys). The conserved carboxylates Asp-358, Glu-401, Asp-426, and Asp-469 were aligned manually to the equivalent RT residues (Asp-443, Glu-478, Asp-498, and Asp-549, respectively). Optimization was set to high, and all other options remained at the defaults. Point mutations in the RNase H domain of Ty3 RT expressed on plasmid p6HTy3RT (8Rausch J.W., Le Grice M.K. Nymark-McMahon H.M. Miller J.T. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13879-13887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were introduced by one of two PCR strategies. For mutants E401Q, D426N, and H427A, 3′- and 5′-primers homologous to the mutation site, each containing the desired mutated codon, were used in separate PCRs (26Vallette F. Mege E. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), paired with the appropriate primer for either an upstream or downstream restriction site (5′-Ty3 RT SalI and 3′-Ty3 RT HindIII, respectively). The PCR products generated overlap at the ends containing the mutation site; these products were then used as templates to amplify the entire mutated construct with outside primers. Mutants D358N, Y459A, and D469N were generated using the appropriate 5′- and 3′-primers containing the desired mutated codon. The resulting fragments were cleaved and subcloned into p6HTy3RT. The final constructs were sequenced completely in the region derived by PCR amplification. These same mutations were introduced into plasmid pEGTy3–1 (24Hansen L.J. Chalker D.L. Sandmeyer S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5245-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). 3′-Primers homologous to the mutation site were used for site-directed mutagenesis as described by Kunkel (25Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Ty3 RT variants were purified from logarithmically grown and isopropyl-1-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced E. coli cultures by a combination of metal chelate (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose, Qiagen) and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, Amersham Biosciences). Purified enzymes were free of contaminating nucleases and stored at −20 °C in a 50% glycerol-containing buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.8, 0.7 m NaCl). Under these conditions we observed minimal loss of activity over several months. RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was evaluated on a 138-nucleotide RNA template (prepared by in vitro transcription), corresponding to nucleotides 4851–4977 of Ty3 genome plus 12 additional nucleotides, hybridized to a 32P-5′-end-labeled 20-nucleotide DNA primer (Integrated DNA Technologies). Template-primer was annealed by incubation at 95 °C in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mm MgCl2 and slow cooling to room temperature. A reaction mixture containing 50 nm template-primer and 250 μm dNTPs was prepared in a buffer comprising 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 9 mm MgCl2, 80 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. DNA synthesis was initiated at 30 °C by the addition of wild type or mutant RT to a final concentration of 50 nm in a final reaction volume of 10 μl. Aliquots were removed after 5 min and mixed with an equal volume of 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA, and 7 m urea containing 0.1% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Polymerization products were resolved by high voltage denaturing PAGE and evaluated by autoradiography. RNase H activity was initially evaluated concomitant with polymerization, using the substrate indicated above but relocating radiolabel to the 5′-terminus of the RNA template. A reaction mixture containing 50 nm template-primer and 250 μm dNTPs was prepared in a buffer of 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.8, 9 mm MgCl2, 80 mmNaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Hydrolysis and polymerization were initiated by adding wild type or mutant RT to a final concentration of 250 nm in a 10-μl reaction and allowed to continue at 30 °C for 20 min. Hydrolysis was terminated as above. Products were resolved by high voltage denaturing electrophoresis and evaluated by autoradiography. In the absence of polymerization, RNase H activity was evaluated on a 5′-end-labeled 40-nucleotide RNA template (Dharmacon Research) annealed to a 30-nucleotide DNA primer (Integrated DNA Technologies). A reaction mixture containing 50 nm template-primer was prepared in a buffer of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 9 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm MnCl2 was used for Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent hydrolysis, respectively. Hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of enzyme to a final concentration of 50 nm in a final volume of 60 μl. 10-μl aliquots were removed at the times indicated and processed as above. Strand transfer reactions were performed using a 40 nucleotide donor RNA template annealed to a32P-5′-end-labeled 20-nucleotide DNA primer (Integrated DNA Technology) and a 40-nucleotide acceptor RNA (Dharmacon Research). Donor and acceptor templates were designed to share 20 nucleotides of homology at their 5′- and 3′-termini, respectively. Polymerization and successful strand transfer produced a 60-nucleotide cDNA product. A reaction mixture containing 50 nm donor RNA template-DNA primer, 250 nm acceptor RNA template, and 250 μm dNTPs was prepared in a buffer of 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.8, 9 mm MgCl2, 80 mmNaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. Polymerization was initiated by the addition of Ty3 RT to a final concentration of 250 mmin a final volume of 60 μl. Ten-μl aliquots were removed at the times indicated in the text and processed as above. The same system was adapted to evaluate RNase H activity during DNA synthesis, using a32P-5′-end-labeled 40-nucleotide donor RNA annealed to the 20-nucleotide DNA primer. To evaluate Ty3 PPT selection a 65-nucleotide (−) strand DNA template (corresponding to nucleotides 4848–4913 of the Ty3 genome) containing the PPT complement was hybridized to a variety of 5′-end-labeled (+) strand RNA primers spanning the PPT by heating to 90 °C and slow cooling in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2. A reaction mixture containing 50 nm template-primer was prepared in a buffer of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 9 mmMgCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol. Hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of RT to a final concentration of 50 mm in a 10-μl volume and allowed to continue at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped and hydrolysis products resolved as above. Qualitative plasmid-based suppressor target assays were performed as described previously (27Nymark-McMahon M.H. Sandmeyer S.B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 453-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay is based on expression of Ty3 under control of the GAL1–10promoter on a URA3-marked donor plasmid (pEGTy3-1) and subsequent integration of the replicated Ty3 into aHIS3-marked target plasmid (pCH2bo19V) (28Kinsey P.T. Sandmeyer S.B. Genetics. 1995; 139: 81-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The target plasmid contains two divergent tRNA genes. One of these tRNA genes acts to recruit Ty3 to the target site. The other is a transcriptionally inactive ochre suppressor tRNATyr gene (sup2-o), which is activated by Ty3 integration into the target site. Transposition is scored by suppression of the ochre nonsense mutations,ade2–101 lys2–1, in yeast strain yTM443. Suppression in cells that have undergone transposition results in papillations on synthetic complete medium containing glucose (SD) and lacking adenine and lysine. yTM443 cells were transformed with pEGTy3-1, carrying wild type or mutant Ty3, and the target plasmid pCH2bo19V and plated onto SD medium lacking uracil and histidine. Three independent colonies from each transformation were patched onto SD −URA −His. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h, and the cells were replica plated to SD medium −Ade −Lys and to synthetic complete medium containing galactose (SG) lacking uracil and histidine to induce Ty3 transposition. After 48 h at 30 °C on SG medium, the patches were replica plated onto SD medium −Ade −Lys and incubated at 30 °C for 6 days. Transposition was scored as papillations on SD medium −Ade −Lys. Cultures (10 ml) of yTM443 cells transformed with pEGTy3-1, carrying wild type or mutant Ty3, were grown in SG medium to an absorbance of ∼1.0 at 600 nm and the cells collected by centrifugation. Whole cell extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (27Nymark-McMahon M.H. Sandmeyer S.B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 453-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, pelleted cells were resuspended in 1.2 ml of whole cell extract buffer (0.1 mmEDTA, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by vortexing in presence of glass beads; the lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined using the micro BCA assay kit (Pierce). 1-liter cultures of yTM443 cells transformed with pEGTy3 derivatives were grown to late log phase in SG medium to induce Ty3 expression. A mock VLP preparation was made with nontransformed yTM443 cells. VLPs were partially purified from whole cell extract as described previously (29Hansen L.J. Chalker D.L. Orlinsky K.J. Sandmeyer S.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested, washed in buffer, digested with zymolyase, and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. Whole cell extract was fractionated over a 70, 30, and 20% (5, 5, and 15 ml, respectively) sucrose step gradient by centrifugation in a Surespin 630/36-ml rotor (Sorvall) at 22,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C. 4 ml of the 70%/30% interface, where VLPs sediment, was collected and divided in two portions. Each portion was concentrated by centrifugation in a Surespin 630/17-ml rotor (Sorvall) at 24,000 for 1 h at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer containing 9 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 13.5 mm KCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. VLP proteins were used for integrase immunoblot analysis. Proteins from whole cell extracts and VLPs were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences), and probed with antibody to Ty3 nucleocapsid protein (a generous gift from J. L. Darlix, ENS-INSERM U412, Lyon, France), capsid protein, or integrase (23Menees T.M. Sandmeyer S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8229-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies to rabbit IgG were detected by chemiluminescence, using the ECL system as described by the manufacturer (AmershamBiosciences). The recombinant enzymes were purified, and their purity was estimated by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1 C). Prior to evaluating Ty3 RNase H function, it was important to confirm that altering conserved residues in this domain did not induce global changes in enzyme structure. Using the approach of Fig.2 A, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and RNase H activity were monitored concomitantly by locating the 32P label to the 5′-terminus of the 20-nucleotide primer or 138-nucleotide RNA template, respectively. The DNA polymerase profiles of Fig. 2 B, i, obtained after a 5-min incubation, indicate minimal differences between the recombinant enzymes. The exception to this was mutant D358N, which consistently displayed lower activity with extended incubation. Equivalent results were obtained on several different substrates (data not shown). Thus, to a first approximation, mutating conserved residues of the Ty3 RNase H domain had minimal effects on the structure of the DNA polymerase catalytic center. In a second experiment, relocating radiolabel to the template 5′-terminus allowed RNase H activity to be evaluated during RNA-dependent DNA synthesis. Under such conditions, the primary hydrolysis products generated by wild type Ty3 RT are 21 and 12 nucleotides (region a), which would be the expected products from a template on which the primer had been fully extended. Despite prolonged incubation, these products are absent for mutants D358N, E401Q, and D426N (Fig. 2 B, ii, lanes 3–5, respectively). By analogy with a recent model for RNase H-mediated catalysis (16Kanaya S. Oobatake M. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32729-32736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), Asp-358 and Asp-426 would directly coordinate the divalent metal, with Glu-401 positioning the water molecule acting as a general acid. Altering any of these three residues might be expected to eliminate hydrolysis. In contrast, His-427, Tyr-459, and Asp-469 appear dispensable for Ty3 RNase H activity (Fig.2 C, ii, lanes 6–8, respectively). In addition to the 21- and 12-nucleotide hydrolysis products, cleavage at two additional regions of the template is evident. The larger of these products (region b) is only slightly smaller than the intact template, suggesting longer residency of these mutants on the initial template-primer duplex and low level template hydrolysis prior to polymerization. Further downstream, a second region of the RNA template is susceptible to hydrolysis. Because the DNA synthesis profiles of these mutants show no major termination products in this region, this might reflect (a) transient pausing at a region of template secondary structure; (b) resolution of this structure via RNase H-mediated hydrolysis; and (c) continued polymerization. Such a mechanism has in fact been proposed for HIV-1 RT (30Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14778-14785Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Suo Z. Johnson K.A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and RNA folding programs indicate a stable stem-loop structure in this region (data not shown). Thus, although presenting a more complex hydrolysis profile, the cumulative data with mutants H427A, Y459A, and D469N indicate that they retain significant RNase H activity on a heteropolymeric RNA·DNA hybrid. Previous work indicated that the HIV-1 RNase H mutant p66E478Q/p51 (33Cirino N.M. Cameron C.E. Smith J.S. Rausch J.W. Roth M.J. Benkovic S.J. Le Grice S.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9936-9943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) recovered polymerization-dependent RNase H activity in Mn2+ on both a random heteropolymeric RNA·DNA hybrid and a second substrate mimicking release of the tRNA primer (33Cirino N.M. Cameron C.E. Smith J.S. Rausch J.W. Roth M.J. Benkovic S.J. Le Grice S.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9936-9943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Smith C.M. Smith J.S. Roth M.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6573-6581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether such a phenotype could be reproduced with Ty3 RT and whether this was restricted to the equivalent catalytic residue, Glu-401. For this analysis, a 32P-labeled 40-nucleotide RNA·30-nucleotide DNA hybrid (Fig.3 A) was employed. In keeping with our recent studies (8Rausch J.W., Le Grice M.K. Nymark-McMahon H.M. Miller J.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13879-13887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the data of Fig. 2, the primary Mg2+-dependent products with wild type Ty3 RT indicate cleavage at template nucleotides −21 and −13 (Fig.3 B, lane W, and Fig. 3 C,i), corresponding to the polymerase-dependent and -independent modes of hydrolysis, respectively, as described by Peliska and Benkovic (35Peliska J.A.

Genetic dissection of interferon signal transduction led to the demonstration that Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are key elements in the interferon signal transduction pathway (9Tanigawa T.

Subsequent biochemical studies have also implicated these molecules in the signal transduction pathways of cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), LIF, oncostatin-M (OSM), and IL-6 (6Ihle J.N.

The murine myeloid leukemic cell line M1 represents a useful model of normal macrophage differentiation and provides the starting point for establishing such a system. Like normal hemopoietic progenitor cells, M1 cells express the receptor tyrosine kinase flt3/flk2 (7Brasel K. Escobar S. Anderberg R. de Vries P. Gruss H.J. Lyman S.D.

Additionally, like primary macrophages, differentiated M1 cells are vacuolated, phagocytic, capable of extensive movement (23Ichikawa Y. J. Cell.

Leukemia (Baltimore). 1989; 3: 349-355PubMed Google Scholar).In the experiments described, we demonstrate that M1 cells provide the basis for a somatic cell genetic approach to dissect the signal transduction pathways used by cytokines to stimulate macrophage differentiation. Two spontaneous and 25 ICR-191-induced IL-6-unresponsive clones of M1 cells were selected in agar based on their ability to form tightly packed colonies, rather than small clusters of dispersed cells, in the presence of high concentrations of this cytokine. These lines were at least 2 orders of magnitude less responsive to IL-6 than wild type M1 cells. Somatic cell fusion experiments demonstrated that the majority of the mutations were recessive. Furthermore, among the recessive cell lines, one group appears to lack functional gp130, consistent with the important role that this receptor component plays in IL-6 signal transduction.DISCUSSIONSomatic cell genetics is a powerful tool by which cellular processes may be investigated. Previously, the genes required for interferon signal transduction have been investigated using a specially engineered fibroblast cell line capable of producing hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in response to type I and type II interferons (33Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following mutagenesis of this cell line, positive and negative selection allowed the identification of IFN-unresponsive mutants. In the first experiment in which complementation was successful, a cDNA library was transfected, and clones that regained responsiveness to IFN were isolated. Using this strategy, Tyk2, a previously isolated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and a member of the Janus kinase family, was shown to be essential for IFN signaling. In subsequent experiments, complementation of the defect was achieved using candidate genes, including the other members of the JAK family, the STATs, and receptor components (9Tanigawa T. Elwood N. Metcalf D. Cary D. DeLuca E. Nicola N.A. Begley C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7864-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Ichikawa Y. J. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).In this study, rather than producing a cell line in which the promoter of a cytokine-responsive gene drives expression of a selectable marker, we have taken advantage of an existing biological response, terminal macrophage differentiation, in M1 cells. As with the studies of Stark, Kerr and colleagues, we found that the spontaneous rate of cytokine unresponsiveness to be very low and have demonstrated that it was possible to dramatically elevate this rate following multiple rounds of treatment with the frameshift mutagen ICR-191. Consistent with the expected effects of ICR-191 in inducing loss of function mutations, most of the mutations in the IL-6-unresponsive lines arising from ICR-191 treatment behaved in a recessive manner. In contrast, the two spontaneous IL-6-unresponsive cell lines that were isolated in the initial optimization of the system and one of the mutants isolated following ICR-191 treatment contained mutations that acted in a dominant manner. These might be loss of function mutations that act in a dominant-negative manner, or alternatively, mutations that result in overproduction of a negative regulator, such as SOCS1 or SOCS3, which have been shown to be capable of inhibiting IL-6 signal transduction in M1 cells (17Alexander W.S. Maurer A.B. Novak U. Harrison-Smith M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6531-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).To demonstrate the utility of the M1 cell system for identifying genes important in cytokine signal transduction, we determined whether any of the mutant cell lines lacked the crucial IL-6 receptor component gp130. Together with the IL-6 receptor α-chain and the IL-6 ligand, gp130 forms part of the IL-6 receptor complex in which two gp130 molecules are required for activation of signaling (29Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis revealed that gp130 expression was reduced or undetectable in 14 out of 27 mutants (UR4, UR14, UR16, UR17, UR18, UR21, UR24, UR25, UR31, UR39, UR41, UR42, UR43, UR45). The transfection of wild type FLAG-tagged gp130 restored the IL-6-responses of these gp130-deficient cells; however, it should be stated that final proof that the causative mutation lies in gp130 will require sequencing of the gp130 gene in these cell lines. Indeed, mutations in other genes might indirectly be responsible for reduced expression of gp130, and it is conceivable that overexpression of gp130 might also compensate for such defects. For example, the IFN-unresponsive U1 cell line had severely impaired IFN-α binding, suggesting a reduced receptor number; however, the phenotype was complemented by overexpression of Tyk2, a downstream tyrosine kinase (30Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 31Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In studies of signal transduction in Caenorhabditis elegans, loss of function of the lin-2 gene resulted in abnormal vulval development but was found to encode a protein involved in localization of the LET-23 receptor (32Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Since very few cell lines that lack gp130 are available, the gp130-deficient cell lines derived from these studies may also become valuable vehicles with which to study the structure and function of gp130. For example, the UR21 cell line has been used to examine various mutants of gp130 that either lacked the Ig domain or contained either the Ig domain from the GM-CSF receptor or the fibronectin type III repeats from the G-CSF receptor (33Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 345: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this way, one can examine the function of gp130 in a cell line in which it is normally expressed. This has an advantage over using a non-native cell line for studying cytokine signaling as these may not contain all the necessary components or the correct environment for signaling to occur.The IL-6-responsive cell lines expressing normal levels of gp130 may also prove to be of interest. We aim to determine how many complementation groups are represented among these cell lines by performing pairwise fusions and assessing the capacity of somatic cell hybrids to respond to IL-6. In parallel, we also aim to examine the expression of other proteins, including JAK1 and STAT3, known to be important in IL-6 signal transduction. Finally, where mutation in the genes of known components of the signal transduction pathway cannot explain the unresponsive phenotype, it may be possible to identify the defective gene by complementation with cDNAs from a library, as occurred with Tyk2 and IFN signal transduction (31Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Genetics has been successfully used to identify and analyze components of signal transduction pathways in a number of systems, including chemotaxis in bacteria (1Boyd A. Simon M. Annu.

Finally, where mutation in the genes of known components of the signal transduction pathway cannot explain the unresponsive phenotype, it may be possible to identify the defective gene by complementation with cDNAs from a library, as occurred with Tyk2 and IFN signal transduction (31Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Somatic cell genetics is a powerful tool by which cellular processes may be investigated. Previously, the genes required for interferon signal transduction have been investigated using a specially engineered fibroblast cell line capable of producing hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in response to type I and type II interferons (33Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Following mutagenesis of this cell line, positive and negative selection allowed the identification of IFN-unresponsive mutants. In the first experiment in which complementation was successful, a cDNA library was transfected, and clones that regained responsiveness to IFN were isolated. Using this strategy, Tyk2, a previously isolated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and a member of the Janus kinase family, was shown to be essential for IFN signaling. In subsequent experiments, complementation of the defect was achieved using candidate genes, including the other members of the JAK family, the STATs, and receptor components (9Tanigawa T. Elwood N.

In this study, rather than producing a cell line in which the promoter of a cytokine-responsive gene drives expression of a selectable marker, we have taken advantage of an existing biological response, terminal macrophage differentiation, in M1 cells. As with the studies of Stark, Kerr and colleagues, we found that the spontaneous rate of cytokine unresponsiveness to be very low and have demonstrated that it was possible to dramatically elevate this rate following multiple rounds of treatment with the frameshift mutagen ICR-191. Consistent with the expected effects of ICR-191 in inducing loss of function mutations, most of the mutations in the IL-6-unresponsive lines arising from ICR-191 treatment behaved in a recessive manner. In contrast, the two spontaneous IL-6-unresponsive cell lines that were isolated in the initial optimization of the system and one of the mutants isolated following ICR-191 treatment contained mutations that acted in a dominant manner. These might be loss of function mutations that act in a dominant-negative manner, or alternatively, mutations that result in overproduction of a negative regulator, such as SOCS1 or SOCS3, which have been shown to be capable of inhibiting IL-6 signal transduction in M1 cells (17Alexander W.S. Maurer A.B. Novak U. Harrison-Smith M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6531-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the utility of the M1 cell system for identifying genes important in cytokine signal transduction, we determined whether any of the mutant cell lines lacked the crucial IL-6 receptor component gp130. Together with the IL-6 receptor α-chain and the IL-6 ligand, gp130 forms part of the IL-6 receptor complex in which two gp130 molecules are required for activation of signaling (29Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis revealed that gp130 expression was reduced or undetectable in 14 out of 27 mutants (UR4, UR14, UR16, UR17, UR18, UR21, UR24, UR25, UR31, UR39, UR41, UR42, UR43, UR45). The transfection of wild type FLAG-tagged gp130 restored the IL-6-responses of these gp130-deficient cells; however, it should be stated that final proof that the causative mutation lies in gp130 will require sequencing of the gp130 gene in these cell lines. Indeed, mutations in other genes might indirectly be responsible for reduced expression of gp130, and it is conceivable that overexpression of gp130 might also compensate for such defects. For example, the IFN-unresponsive U1 cell line had severely impaired IFN-α binding, suggesting a reduced receptor number; however, the phenotype was complemented by overexpression of Tyk2, a downstream tyrosine kinase (30Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 31Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In studies of signal transduction in Caenorhabditis elegans, loss of function of the lin-2 gene resulted in abnormal vulval development but was found to encode a protein involved in localization of the LET-23 receptor (32Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since very few cell lines that lack gp130 are available, the gp130-deficient cell lines derived from these studies may also become valuable vehicles with which to study the structure and function of gp130. For example, the UR21 cell line has been used to examine various mutants of gp130 that either lacked the Ig domain or contained either the Ig domain from the GM-CSF receptor or the fibronectin type III repeats from the G-CSF receptor (33Hammacher A. Richardson R.T. Layton J.E. Smith D.K. Angus L.J. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Wijdenes J. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Hammacher A. Wijdenes J. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Simpson R.J. Layton J.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this way, one can examine the function of gp130 in a cell line in which it is normally expressed. This has an advantage over using a non-native cell line for studying cytokine signaling as these may not contain all the necessary components or the correct environment for signaling to occur. The IL-6-responsive cell lines expressing normal levels of gp130 may also prove to be of interest. We aim to determine how many complementation groups are represented among these cell lines by performing pairwise fusions and assessing the capacity of somatic cell hybrids to respond to IL-6. In parallel, we also aim to examine the expression of other proteins, including JAK1 and STAT3, known to be important in IL-6 signal transduction.
