https://openalex.org/W2063522701,"An ice core in south Greenland covering the period 1869 to 1984 was analyzed for oxygen isotopes and chloride, nitrate, and sulfate concentrations. The data show that the ""excess"" (nonsea-salt) sulfate concentration has tripled since approximately 1900 to 1910 and the nitrate concentration has doubled since approximately 1955. The increases may be attributable to the deposition of these chemical specis from air masses carrying North American and Eurasian anthropogenic emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2058699121,"The periodic deposition of distal turbidites at a site on the Madeira Abyssal Plain causes the development of a nonsteady-state diagenetic system in which an oxidation front migrates downward into the sediment. Data presented here show that iron, manganese, and particulate organic carbon are oxidized at this front by oxidants (molecular oxygen and nitrate) diffusing from above. A numerical model of systems of this type predicts the formation of iron-rich layers under certain nonsteady-state conditions. The layers predicted by the model are closely comparable in thickness and general morphology to iron-rich layers found in certain ocean sediments, the origin of which has been until now unexplained."
https://openalex.org/W2070265911,"It has been suggested that Thaxteriola species and other minute, nonmycelial fungi associated with arthropods have phylogenetic relationships with the Laboulbeniales. However, direct development of the thallus of Thaxteriola from an ascospore of Pyxidiophora has now been discovered. Thaxteriola is specialized for dispersal by mites carried on pine bark beetles; other fungi dispersed by arthropods in this symbiotic assemblage rely primarily on arthropod specializations."

https://openalex.org/W2109457031,"With regard to promoting the competitiveness of U.S. industry, federal science policy is performing unevenly. Federally supported basic research is not well aligned with industrial needs, although the National Science Foundation's Engineering Research Centers and similar programs are improving matters. Large-scale federal undertakings in science and technology, such as the Apollo program and now the Strategic Defense Initiative, actually tend to divert resources away from commercial research and development. Needed are federal and industrial leaders who will work together to serve the interests of both competitive industry and efficient government in the United States."
