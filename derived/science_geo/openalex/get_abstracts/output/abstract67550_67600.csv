https://openalex.org/W1505766966,"Abstract To define a model for enzyme latency in vitro, the capture was studied of egg white lysozyme by liposomes (phospholipid spherules in the smectic mesophase). Gel filtration resolved liposomes formed in the absence of enzyme from free enzyme when both were chromatographed immediately after mixing. In contrast, if liposomes were swollen in the presence of lysozyme, subsequent chromatography disclosed two peaks of enzyme activity: one associated with liposomes, the other emerging as free lysozyme. The activity of lysozyme associated with liposomes was latent; i.e. there was little or no activity on substrate (Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell walls) unless the spherules were disrupted by Triton X-100, amphotericin B, or nystatin. Lysozyme unassociated with lipid was as available to substrate in the absence of detergent or polyenes as in their presence. Charge-induced associations were not crucial for enzyme capture since both positively (lecithin-stearylamine-cholesterol) and negatively charged liposomes (lecithin-dicetylphosphate-cholesterol) captured lysozyme in latent form. As a measure of their integrity, liposomes could also be shown to capture a marker molecule (glucose), the bulk of which was released together with lysozyme from liposomes by detergent or polyenes. As the aqueous interspaces of positively charged liposomes were increased by incremental incorporation of stearylamine, capture of both glucose and lysozyme was increased proportionally. For these and other reasons it was considered likely that the liposomes had captured lysozyme in the interspaces between lipid lamellae."
https://openalex.org/W1627902834,"The reaction of hemoglobin with oxygen has been studied by stopped flow methods, and, under suitably restricted conditions, it can be adequately represented by a system of four consecutive reversible reactions. The numerical values given to the eight rate constants permit a satisfactory fit to combination and dissociation velocity data, and yield an equilibrium curve of the appropriate form. The distribution of rates among the various steps in the reaction requires that cooperativity in oxygen binding be attributed primarily to deviations of the successive dissociation velocity constants from their statistical values, and is consistent with the idea that the major change in reactivity occurs after 1 ligand molecule has dissociated from saturated hemoglobin. The difference in affinity between hemoglobin in phosphate buffers and hemoglobin freed from salts is due to reduction in the rate of dissociation of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th molecules leaving oxyhemoglobin. The rate of dissociation of the 1st molecule from saturated hemoglobin is not changed."
https://openalex.org/W1551581768,"Abstract Bovine thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin, TSH) has been separated into two different subunits by gel filtration in ammonium bicarbonate solution after prior treatment with 1 m propionic acid. The two subunits, which have been designated TSH-α and TSH-β, resemble each other more closely in amino acid composition than do the two subunits of luteinizing hormone (LH, interstitial cell-stimulating hormone), CI and CII, but there are differences in the contents of aspartic acid, isoleucine, leucine, and tyrosine. Maps of the tryptic peptides and the biological properties of TSH-α and -β differ markedly. TSH-α and the CI chain of LH are closely related both in amino acid and carbohydrate composition; their peptide maps are also very similar. By themselves each subunit of TSH has little or no TSH activity, but activity is restored to about 50% of that of undissociated TSH by combining the two in equal amounts. The CI chain of LH can substitute fully for TSH-α in reconstitution of TSH activity, and other experiments indicate that TSH-α and the CII chain of LH will combine to form a hybrid active LH. TSH-β and CII differ markedly in amino acid composition and immunological properties, and do not appear to interact with each other. The data obtained, thus far, show that the TSH-α chain and the LH-CI chain have very similar or nearly identical primary structures. Thus, the different hormonal activities of TSH and LH have originated from the combination of this type of chain with one of two other peptide chains, TSH-β and LH-CII, respectively, whose amino acid sequences most probably differ considerably."
https://openalex.org/W2048868579,"Mouse skin contains aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase which is highly inducible. The enzyme system is inhibited when 7,8-benzoflavone is added to homogenates of skin epidermis. 7,8-Benzoflavone also inhibits mouse skin tumorigenesis caused by repeated treatment with 9,10-dimethylbenzanthracene or by a single treatment with this chemical followed by weekly treatment with croton oil. These findings suggest that this enzyme system may be responsible for the activation of 9,10-dimethylbenzanthracene to its carcinogenic form."

Iso-II cytochrome c from this species and cytochrome c from Candida krusei also contain 1 residue of this amino acid. Thus, cytochromes c of Ascomycetes contain 1 residue and, as previously reported, a higher plant contains 2 residues of e-N-trimethyllysine. This amino acid is completely absent from a large variety of animal cytochromes and from other types of proteins."

The ratio increases as the severity of the disease increases, being 1.71 in cases in which the urinary output of protein is equal to or greater than 3 grams per 24 hours. Histoincompatibility of the fetus and mother, including incompatibility due to an antigen (or antigens) dependent on the Y chromosome, is suggested to function in the pathogenesis of pregnancy toxemia."

https://openalex.org/W1552164545,Abstract The helical stability of poly-l-glutamic acid and poly-l-ornithine in aqueous alcohol solutions was studied by optical rotatory dispersion and potentiometric titration determinations. It was found that aliphatic alcohols enhance the stability of the helix according to the series methanol l ethanol l 1-propanol l 1-butanol. The role of secondary and tertiary alcohols was also investigated. Thermodynamic analysis of the thermal transition of uncharged poly-l-ornithine showed that the greater stability of the helix in aqueous alcohol solutions with respect to that in water arises from a more favorable value of the entropy change of the transition ΔS0. A similar effect of alcohols on the thermodynamics of the coil-helix transition in aqueous solution has already been observed for poly-l-glutamic acid. It is suggested that solvation of the peptide amide group in the randomly coiled conformation may be responsible for the observed trend of the variation of the thermodynamic quantities.
https://openalex.org/W2280629071,"Abstract Specific glucocorticoid receptors previously identified in rat thymus cells by measurements of steroid binding to whole cells are found to be located largely, if not entirely, in the nucleus. Localization is accomplished by showing that cortisol-3H, that is specifically bound to whole cells, remains with the nuclei (identified as such by electron microscopy) after cell membranes and cytoplasmic materials are removed by hypotonic shock in 1.5 mm MgCl2 at 3°. The cortisol-receptor complex has been extracted from nuclei and separated from free cortisol by gel chromatography. It is rapidly degraded by Pronase. The rate at which cortisol dissociated at 37° from the isolated complex, and from nuclei, is indistinguishable from the characteristic slow rate at which specifically bound cortisol dissociates from whole cells, showing that this latter rate is an intrinsic property of the cortisol-receptor complex. The rate at which cortisol associates specifically with whole cells at 37° is indistinguishable from the rate at which it appears in the nuclear receptor complex."

https://openalex.org/W1992558637,Threshold energies were determined for brief flashes as a function of their duration in order to determine the maximum duration for which the flash intensity and duration could be varied reciprocally without affecting detectability (the Bunsen-Roscoe effect). A pair of threshold-level flashes for which reciprocity obtained in the determination of threshold were shown to be discriminable from each other at several imperfectly detectable energy levels. Thus equal detectability of flashes of equal energy does not imply identical neural responses to such stimuli. It is suggested that the summation reflects primarily the operation of the detection mechanism rather than of the peripheral visual mechanism. Some general implications for the interpretation of threshold measures are also discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1496426208,"Abstract Chick embryo cartilage incubated with dl-3,4-dehydroproline (3,4-dehydroproline) synthesized collagen containing the analogue in place of proline. It was not possible to determine the degree to which 3,4-dehydroproline replaced proline, but under comparable conditions 14C-dl-3,4-dehydroproline was incorporated at about one-fifth the rate of 14C-l-proline. The hydroxyproline content of the collagen was decreased because the analogue replaced prolyl residues which were normally hydroxylated, and because the proline still incorporated was not hydroxylated to the same extent as in control tissues. With tissues incubated with 14C-proline and 40 to 100 µg per ml of dl-3,4-dehydroproline the hydroxylation of 14C-proline in collagen was decreased to one-third to one-half of the control value. The hydroxylation of 14C-lysine in collagen was depressed to about the same degree. The analogue did not inhibit protocollagen proline hydroxylase, and gel filtration indicated the proteins synthesized in the presence of the analogue were of the same size as proteins from control tissues. The 14C-hydroxyproline content of collagen containing 3,4-dehydroproline could not be increased by incubating it with excess protocollagen proline hydroxylase. Collagenous polypeptides prepared by incubating cartilage with puromycin and 3,4-dehydroproline formed stable enzyme-substrate complexes similar to complexes formed with polypeptides which did not contain 3,4-dehydroproline. However, the polypeptides containing 3,4-dehydroproline differed from polypeptides which did not contain the analogue in that they remained attached to the enzyme after incubation with excess enzyme and cofactors. This observation may explain the decreased hydroxylation of collagen containing the analogue in that tight binding of the enzyme to a 3,4-dehydroproline residue at one position in a substrate polypeptide may sterically hinder the hydroxylation of adjacent prolyl or lysyl residues in the same molecule. Autoradiographic experiments indicated that collagen containing 3,4-dehydroproline was not extruded from cartilage cells as rapidly as normal collagen."

For a processing method to be acceptable, it must not only decrease the nucleic acid level to the required degree, but it must also be inexpensive and must not contaminate the product with undesirable chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W1513166763,"Water-soluble reagents were prepared by converting 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl halides into corresponding dimethyl(2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl)sulfonium salts. The resulting salts were found to selectively modify tryptophan and cysteine when added to amino acids in aqueous solutions. N-Acetyltryptophan, glycyltryptophan, and tryptophanylglycine appeared equal to tryptophan in reactivity with the sulfonium chloride; comparable reactivity was observed with chymotrypsin. Although the sulfonium salts are rapidly hydrolyzed in neutral and alkaline solutions, aqueous solutions at pH 3 are relatively stable. Thus, in contrast to 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, an aqueous solution of dimethyl(2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl)sulfonium chloride can be used to modify proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2019949229,"Human infants younger than crawling age yielded reliable cardiac decelerations when placed directly atop the deep side of a visual cliff and generally nonsignificant changes when atop the shallow side. Distress was elicited less frequently on the deep side than on the shallow at these ages, in contrast to the behavior of older infants and other species. Prelocomotor infants thus can discriminate the two sides of the cliff, but not by means of distress at loss of optical support."

Removal of the pineal organ and parietal eye in blinded lizards does not prevent entrainment. Our data demonstrate the existence of an extraretinal photoreceptor which can mediate entrainment of a biological clock in reptiles.
https://openalex.org/W1579359155,"Abstract The steady state kinetics of the calf brain ATP-creatine transphosphorylase seems to be adequately expressed by a random quasi-equilibrium type of mechanism with a rate-limiting step at the interconversion of the ternary complexes and for a case without independent binding of the substrates. Values for the kinetic parameters at pH 8.8, 30°, have been deduced. The over-all equilibrium constant, calculated kinetically from the Haldane relations, agreed satisfactorily with the thermodynamic value assigned previously (Kuby and Noltmann, The enzymes, Vol. 6, 1962, p. 515). Values for Ks1 versus Ks1 (i.e. intrinsic dissociation constants of the substrate from the ternary and binary complexes, respectively) differed very significantly (e.g. for the forward reaction: Kmgatp2- and Kmgatp2- were 1.35 x 10-4 and 0.93 x 10-3 m, Kcreatine and Kcreatine were 3.7 x 10-3 m and 2.9 x 10-2 m, respectively). The possibility might then be entertained, that at pH 8.8, an enhancement in binding of the individual substrate in the ternary complex has occurred compared to the binary enzyme-substrate complex (cf. Morrison and James, Biochem. J., 97, 37 (1965)). Also, it has been tentatively concluded that ADP3- may compete with MgADP- for binding to the enzyme with a type of inhibition at high ADP0 concentrations which has been evaluated in terms of an abortive and inactive ternary complex with creatine phosphate2-, and which forms also in a random manner. The kinetic parameters have also been estimated for the calf muscle isoenzyme at pH 8.8 (and calculated for the above mechanism). Certain distinguishing kinetic features of each isoenzyme at pH 8.8 are then briefly outlined. A further comparison of the calf brain enzyme's kinetic data obtained at pH 8.8 with those obtained at pH 7.4 reveal several significant differences in the derived parameters, especially in Vmaxreverse (with a large increase), in Kcr∼p2- (with a large decrease), and in comparatively smaller (or even insignificant) decreases between respective Ks1 and Ks1 values (in which case, the brain-type enzyme seems to approach the muscle-type enzyme in its kinetic characteristics). An over-all evaluation of the data (physical, chemical, and kinetic) gathered for the calf brain ATP-creatine transphosphorylase seems to lead to the conclusion that it is susceptible to gross conformational changes as a result of environmental influences, in contrast to the more stable molecular unit to be found in the muscle-type ATP-creatine transphosphorylase."

https://openalex.org/W2012560615,"Atmospheric surveillance is necessary in order to identify airborne pollutants, to establish ambient concentrations of these pollutants, and to record their trends and patterns. Air pollutants may occur in the form of gases, liquids, and solids, both singly and in combination. Gaseous pollutants make up about 90 percent of the total mass emitted to the atmosphere with particulates and aerosols accounting for the remaining 10 percent. Small particulates are of particular importance because they may be in the respirable size range. These small particles may contain biologically active elements and compounds. Furthermore, they tend to remain in the atmosphere where they interfere with both solar and terrestrial infrared radiation, which may affect climate on a global basis."
https://openalex.org/W1605840023,"Abstract The activities of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase were determined in pre- and postimplantation mouse embryos and in preimplantation rabbit embryos. Both enzymes increase in activity during the preimplantation period, with hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase having a sharp increase during the 3rd day of mouse embryo development. Postimplantation activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase parallels the weight of the embryo between Days 8 and 13. Preimplantation mouse embryos cultured in vitro have the same patterns of enzyme activity as do embryos developing in vivo, and changing environmental factors are not responsible for alterations in enzyme activity. Despite differences in the rate of development in vivo and in vitro, enzyme activity remains closely correlated with morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2051722808,"A circadian rhythm has been found in hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity of the pineal gland of blinded 12-day-old rats. Five additional hours of lighting can partly prevent the nocturnal increase in pineal hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity in such rats. Removal of the Harderian gland abolishes this response to light in 12-day-old blinded animals, giving further support to the suggestion that this gland may function as an extraretinal photosensitive organ influencing the pineal gland in blinded suckling rats."
https://openalex.org/W1546548688,"Abstract Optical rotation measurements and absorption difference spectroscopy of ribonuclease A in different water-acetic acid mixtures showed that at least three conformational situations exist for the protein molecule at different levels of acetic acid concentration. Hematoporphyrin-sensitized photooxidation of the native as well as of the denatured proteins allowed us to detect three discrete states of reactivity for the 4 methionyl residues of ribonuclease A. On the basis of the photooxidation kinetics and of the conformational analyses, we concluded that methionine-29 is partly exposed in the native protein and methionine-13 is partially buried, whereas methionine-30 and methionine-79 are deeply buried. The importance of the single methionyl residues for the catalytic activity of the enzyme has been also resolved. The described procedure appears to be a reliable tool for examining the state of the amino acid residues in proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1531939919,"Abstract The addition of excess l-methionine to culture media in which were incubated Chang's liver cells resulted in inhibition of cell multiplication, accumulation of cellular protein, and, relative to the latter, an excessive increase of ornithine δ-aminotransferase activity. Activity of ornithine δ-aminotransferase per cell increased about 250% and specific activity about 65% during 3 days of growth under these conditions. Glycine, serine, histidine, tyrosine, and tryptophan also inhibited cell multiplication and brought about an accumulation of cellular protein, but did not increase ornithine δ-aminotransferase activity relative to other protein. Incorporation of 14C-leucine into cellular protein was also inhibited by excess methionine and the degree of inhibition roughly paralleled the inhibition of cell multiplication. A potential metabolic product of methionine, namely homocysteine, added to the culture medium produced the same effects as methionine at about one-tenth the concentration. The toxic manifestations of excess dietary methionine, which are in this case growth retardation and protein accumulation, were not antagonized by glycine or arginine as they are in animals in vivo. Arginine, in excess in the medium, did not inhibit cell multiplication appreciably, nor cause accumulation of cellular protein, but did significantly elevate ornithine δ-aminotransferase activity. These results suggested that the increase of ornithine δ-aminotransferase activity was probably unrelated to inhibition of cell division and accumulation of cellular protein. The specific increase of ornithine δ-aminotransferase activity in response to excess methionine is parallel to similar observations with rat liver and kidney."

https://openalex.org/W1671510321,"Abstract The single, uncross-linked polypeptide chain of the zymogen of the streptococcal proteinase is unfolded to a random structure in 6 m guanidinium chloride. When the denaturing agent is removed by dialysis, the potential enzymatic activity after tryptic hydrolysis and reduction is recoverable in 90% yield. Data on the unfolding process have been obtained by enzymatic assays and by optical rotatory dispersion. The zymogen also refolds after being heated at 100° for 10 min at pH 6.7 or after treatment with 0.1 n HCl for 2 hours at 25°. The proteolyzed zymogen, in which the first 100 residues from the NH2 terminus of the parent molecule have been removed, is irreversibly denatured under the same conditions. The NH2-terminal portion of the zymogen is thus necessary for the re-formation of the catalytically active molecule from the fully unfolded chain in this zymogen-enzyme system."
https://openalex.org/W1589116045,"l -Aspartate β-decarboxylase ( l -aspartate 4-carboxy-lyase) of Pseudomonas dacunhae has a molecular weight of about 800,000. On treatment with 1 m guanidine the enzyme dissociates into subunits of intermediate size (mol wt = about 400,000, s = 5.6 S). Removal of guanidine by dialysis results in reassociation to the native enzyme. Irreversible dissociation to an ultimate subunit (mol wt = 100,000, s20,w0 = 6.9 S) occurs on treatment with 5 m guanidine. On treatment with 5 m guanidine in the presence of 0.1 m mercaptoethanol, this enzyme dissociates into smaller polypeptide chains (mol wt = 50,000, s20,w0 = 4.2 S). Aspartate β-decarboxylase contains 32 sulfhydryl groups per 800,000 g of protein as determined by titration with p-chloromercuribenzoate in 5 m guanidine. The number of half-cystine residues per 800,000 g of protein is 48 as determined by amino acid analysis. Also 8 disulfide groups per molecule were found. Phenylthiocarbamylation of apodecarboxylase in 8 m urea gives 0.87 (corrected) mole of serine phenylthiohydantoin on hydrolysis, and hydrazinolysis gives 0.73 (corrected) mole of lysine per 50,000 g of enzyme. Digestion of apodecarboxylase with carboxypeptidase B in 2 m urea releases 0.98 mole of lysine per 50,000 g of enzyme. The evidence from these analyses suggests that the enzyme consists of subunits with a molecular weight of 100,000 and that each is composed of two apparently identical polypeptide chains (mol wt = 50,000) covalently linked through a single disulfide linkage. Amino acid analysis of the enzyme is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W1526088438,"Abstract We have shown conclusively that during the hydrolysis of N-acylamino acid esters by proteases the substrate bond cleaved is the acyl-carbon-ethereal oxygen bond. This was done by hydrolyzing the ethyl esters in H218O-enriched water, isolating the ethanol formed, and determining the 18O:16O ratio. The amount of ethanol-18O found was that of natural abundance. This result supports what has hitherto been an assumption as to the site of bond cleavage. We discuss the implications of this for various rack, or bond angle distortion, mechanisms which have been proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1601519747,"Abstract Hydrogen-deuterium exchange of α-chymotrypsin and its diisopropylphosphoryl derivative was studied by the infrared spectroscopic method. The reactions were studied at 22 ± 1° at several pH values ranging from 2 to 6. The extent of exchange in α-chymotrypsin varied parabolically with pH, with a minimum of exchange at pH 3.5. Graphical analyses of the exchange curves revealed three classes of hydrogens with different rate constants of exchange, in addition to a class which had not exchanged at the end of 24 hours. The slowest class had a pH-dependent rate constant with a minimum at pH 3.5. The exchange data of diisopropylphosphoryl chymotrypsin showed significant variations from those of the pure enzyme, particularly in the region of pH 5. The rate constants of the slow class of hydrogens in diisopropylphosphoryl chymotrypsin varied with pH with minima in the same (pH 5) region."
