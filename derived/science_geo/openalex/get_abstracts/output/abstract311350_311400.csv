https://openalex.org/W2040704646,"Measurements made from the Research Platform FLIP provide some of the first direct observations of three-dimensional flow within the surface mixed layer of the ocean. Relatively narrow regions of downwelling flow were found within the mixed layer, in coincidence with bands of convergent surface flow. At mid-depth in the mixed layer, the downwelling flow had magnitudes of up to 0.2 meter per second and was accompanied by a downwind, horizontal jet of comparable magnitude. There is some evidence that these motions transport heat and phytoplankton within the mixed layer."

The application of nuclear magnetic resonance to the study of the structures of materials of interest in chemistry, earth science, and materials science are discussed together with a prognosis for future work."

Great changes must have occurred in its early history,
but even yet both gradual and sudden changes show
us that it has not gained complete equilibrium. The
sudden movements, which we call earthquakes, give us
important information about the constitution of the
earth."

That loss was attributed to the fact that the meeting was held in New Orleans for the first time, and most of the lost attendees were students and young professionals who had previously come for only 1 day. The number of exhibitors and the number of booths, however, were both up about 15 percent, to 730 and 1856, respectively. A large proportion of that increase was contributed by foreign companies exhibiting for the first time, but there were also some well-known names, such as General Electric and Xerox, making first forays into analytical chemistry. There was also a sharp increase in the number and type of instruments displayed. ""The key skill now in analytical chemistry,"" says Perkin-Elmer president Horace McDonell, Jr., ""may be simply finding the right tool to obtain the answers you need."" The predominant theme of the show, as it has been for the past few years, was automation of both laboratories and instruments. That trend is having major effects in chemical laboratories, but it is also affecting the instrument companies themselves. At large companies such as Varian, Beckman, and Perkin-Elmer, as much as 50 percent of the research and development budget is now going toward development of software-a much higher percentage than it was even 5 years ago. Another trend in automation also seemed clear at the show. As recently as 2 or 3 years ago, much of the available software for chemistry was designed for Apple and similar computers. Now, the laboratory standard is the IBM PC. As a representative of another company that manufactures computers noted with only slight exaggeration, ""There's probably not a booth on the floor that doesn't have one."""
