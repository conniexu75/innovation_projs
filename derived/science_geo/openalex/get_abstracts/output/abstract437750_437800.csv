Sun et al. (p. 366 ; see the Perspective by Bottjer ) present evidence that exceptionally high temperatures themselves may have caused some extinctions during the end-Permian. A rapid temperature rise coincided with a general absence of ichthyofauna in equatorial regions, as well as an absence of many species of marine mammals and calcareous algae, consistent with thermal influences on the marine low latitudes. Sea surface temperatures approached 40°C, which suggests that land temperatures likely fluctuated to even higher values that suppressed terrestrial equatorial plant and animal abundance during most of the Early Triassic."
https://openalex.org/W1986981715,A Twist of Light The angular momentum of photons can be used to encode and transmit information. Cai et al. (p. 363 ) developed a method for generating and emitting controllable orbital angular momentum states of light from a reconfigurable and scalable silicon photonic chip. Using micro-ring resonators embedded with angular gratings allowed the imprinting of optical angular momentum on the light propagating in the whispering gallery modes of the resonator. The method may enable large-scale integration of optical vortex emitters on complementary metal-oxide–semiconductor-compatible silicon chips.
https://openalex.org/W1971526515,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans. Here we show that gliomas can originate from differentiated cells in the central nervous system (CNS), including cortical neurons. Transduction by oncogenic lentiviral vectors of neural stem cells (NSCs), astrocytes, or even mature neurons in the brains of mice can give rise to malignant gliomas. All the tumors, irrespective of the site of lentiviral vector injection (the initiating population), shared common features of high expression of stem or progenitor markers and low expression of differentiation markers. Microarray analysis revealed that tumors of astrocytic and neuronal origin match the mesenchymal GBM subtype. We propose that most differentiated cells in the CNS upon defined genetic alterations undergo dedifferentiation to generate a NSC or progenitor state to initiate and maintain the tumor progression, as well as to give rise to the heterogeneous populations observed in malignant gliomas."

One current challenge is the controlled assembly of colloidal particles into larger structures, such as two-dimensional lattices on a substrate, or three-dimensional superparticles. Wang et al. (p. 358 ) present a two-step self-assembly of CdSe/CdS semiconductor nanorods to form mesoscopic colloidal superparticles. The particles show well-defined super-crystalline domains with dimensions ranging from hundreds of nanometers to several microns, and with the particle morphology controlled by the number of constituent rods. Films of the needle-shaped superparticles were able to act as polarizing light-emitting diodes."

However, the lack of a comprehensive record reflecting atmospheric (14)C prior to 12.5 thousand years before the present (kyr B.P.) has limited the application of radiocarbon dating of samples from the Last Glacial period. Here, we report (14)C results from Lake Suigetsu, Japan (35°35'N, 135°53'E), which provide a comprehensive record of terrestrial radiocarbon to the present limit of the (14)C method. The time scale we present in this work allows direct comparison of Lake Suigetsu paleoclimatic data with other terrestrial climatic records and gives information on the connection between global atmospheric and regional marine radiocarbon levels."

Näsvall et al.

Experimental selection on Salmonella enterica allowed an ancestral gene to evolve new enzymatic function in fewer than 3000 generations."
https://openalex.org/W1996646041,"Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) plays an important role in the growth and metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells in stress conditions. Here, we report that SAICAR (succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribose-5'-phosphate, an intermediate of the de novo purine nucleotide synthesis pathway) specifically stimulates PKM2. Upon glucose starvation, cellular SAICAR concentration increased in an oscillatory manner and stimulated PKM2 activity in cancer cells. Changes in SAICAR amounts in cancer cells altered cellular energy level, glucose uptake, and lactate production. The SAICAR-PKM2 interaction also promoted cancer cell survival in glucose-limited conditions. SAICAR accumulation was not observed in normal adult epithelial cells or lung fibroblasts, regardless of glucose conditions. This allosteric regulation may explain how cancer cells coordinate different metabolic pathways to optimize their growth in the nutrient-limited conditions commonly observed in the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2008255393,"Certain stress conditions can induce cleavage of tRNAs around the anticodon loop via the use of the ribonuclease angiogenin. The cellular factors that regulate tRNA cleavage are not well known. In this study we used normal and eIF2α phosphorylation-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and applied a microarray-based methodology to identify and compare tRNA cleavage patterns in response to hypertonic stress, oxidative stress (arsenite), and treatment with recombinant angiogenin. In all three scenarios mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in eIF2α phosphorylation showed a higher accumulation of tRNA fragments including those derived from initiator-tRNAMet. We have shown that tRNA cleavage is regulated by the availability of angiogenin, its substrate (tRNA), the levels of the angiogenin inhibitor RNH1, and the rates of protein synthesis. These conclusions are supported by the following findings: (i) exogenous treatment with angiogenin or knockdown of RNH1 increased tRNA cleavage; (ii) tRNA fragment accumulation was higher during oxidative stress than hypertonic stress, in agreement with a dramatic decrease of RNH1 levels during oxidative stress; and (iii) a positive correlation was observed between angiogenin-mediated tRNA cleavage and global protein synthesis rates. Identification of the stress-specific tRNA cleavage mechanisms and patterns will provide insights into the role of tRNA fragments in signaling pathways and stress-related disorders.

The percentage of tRNA cleavage during stress is very small (1–2%); hence, tRNA cleavage will not shrink the cellular tRNA pool significantly and decrease translation rates directly. However, it has been shown that when a pool of endogenous tiRNAs is transfected into U2OS cells, protein synthesis rates decreased by ∼20% (36.Yamasaki S. Ivanov P. Hu G.F. Anderson P.

Recent reports show that transfection of cells with natural or selected synthetic 5′ tiRNAs (5′ tRNAAla and 5′ tRNACys) can inhibit protein synthesis by displacing eIF4G/eIF4A from both uncapped and capped RNAs (20.Ivanov P.

Earlier work from this laboratory showed that during severe hypertonic stress there is a global shutdown of protein synthesis, and this translational arrest does not require phosphorylation of eIF2α (19.Bevilacqua E.

This important observation led us to investigate the mechanism and patterns of tRNA cleavage during cellular stress. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from C57BL/6 mice (S/S) and mice with a homozygous mutation in eIF2α (S51A) that abolishes the phosphorylation site (A/A) we have established the patterns of tRNA cleavage during oxidative stress, hypertonic stress, and treatment with recombinant ANG. We have also determined the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation on the extent and specificity of cleavage. In all three scenarios MEFs deficient in eIF2α phosphorylation showed a higher accumulation of tiRNAs including those derived from initiator-tRNAMet. The extent of tRNA cleavage was also dependent on the type and intensity of stress. We found that tiRNA accumulation was higher during oxidative stress compared with hypertonic stress in both S/S and A/A cells. A trigger for tRNA cleavage during oxidative stress was the increased availability of ANG, due to the decreased levels of its inhibitor RNH1. Higher tRNA cleavage also correlated with higher rates of protein synthesis. This was further supported by a decrease in tiRNA accumulation in ANG treated cells in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. We propose that the accessibility of tRNAs to ANG-mediated cleavage during stress is higher when protein synthesis is active and tRNAs transit more frequently between the ribosome-bound (EF1A-bound) and the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-bound states (47.Negrutskii B.S.

S/S and A/A MEFs were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Media were supplemented with sucrose to give the desired osmolarity, assuming that the standard medium is 300 mosmol/liter. Unless otherwise specified, hypertonic medium was 600 mosmol/liter, obtained by addition of 300 mm sucrose to standard medium. S/S and A/A cells were treated with 500 μm sodium arsenite for the times specified. S/S and A/A cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml recombinant ANG for 90 min unless otherwise specified. Hippuristanol (Hipp) (gift from J. Tanaka) treatments were done in combination with ANG for 90 min with concentrations as specified. Transfection of control siRNA and siRNH1 (Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific) by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were plated in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 h and used at 70–80% confluence. Plates were washed twice and changed to Opti-MEM (GIBCO) without serum before transfection. After transfection cells were allowed to grow in normal media before the experiments. Total RNA enriched in small RNAs was obtained using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's manuals. Total RNA (5 μg) was labeled with radioactive [γ-32P]ATP and separated on 10% Tris-Borate-EDTA-urea acrylamide gels. Gel fractions containing cleaved tRNA fragments were visualized and isolated using intensities evaluated with a PhosphorImager and were eluted in 450 μl of crush and soak buffer (50 mm KOAc, 200 mm KCl, pH 7.5) with rocking at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, ethanol precipitation was performed to obtain the cleaved tRNA fractions. These were then hybridized onto the microarrays. The custom tRNA microarray contained a total of 95 oligonucleotide probes and one empty slot (for buffer only), each repeated eight times. There were 45 probes for mouse nuclear-encoded tRNAs, and other yeast and Escherichia coli tRNA probes for hybridization and normalization controls.

The oligonucleotides were printed manually to generate large array spots necessary for radioactive detection. The array hybridization protocol has been described previously for the analysis of tRNA abundance and charging levels (52.Dittmar K.A. Mobley E.M. Radek A.J. Pan T.

Selective charging of tRNA isoacceptors induced by amino-acid starvation.EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to hybridization, microarray slides were immersed in boiling water for 2 min to remove undesired particles and uncross-linked oligonucleotides. Total RNA from cells was isolated using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit that allows an enrichment of small RNAs. Four bacterial tRNA transcripts (5′ and 3′ halves of E. coli tRNALys, 5′ and 3′ halves of E. coli tRNATyr) of sizes 35–43 nt were then added to the total RNA. The sequence of these transcripts were: E. coli tRNA Lys 5′, GGGUCGUUAGCUCAGU UGGUAGAGCAGUUGACUUU; E. coli tRNA Lys 3′, UAAUCAAUUGGUCGCAGGUUCGAA UCCUGCACGACCCA; E. coli tRNA Tyr 5′, GGUGGGGUUCCCGAGCGGCCAAAGGGAGCAGACUGU; and E. coli tRNA Tyr 3′, AAAUCUGCCGUCAUCGACUUCGAAGGUUCGAAUCCUUCCCCCA. These bacterial tRNA halves serve as internal controls for microarray measurements. The samples were labeled with radioactive [γ-32P]ATP. tRNA fragments were separated from full-length tRNA by running the samples in denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gels. The bands corresponding to the size of 35–40 nt were cut out of the gel and purified. For a size comparison 32P-labeled bacterial tRNA halves were run on the same gel. The RNA was extracted from the gel pieces by overnight elution with crush and soak buffer at 4 °C followed by ethanol precipitation. The labeled tiRNA sample was then dissolved in microarray hybridization buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 20 μg of salmon sperm DNA and 10 μg of poly(A). This was then applied to the hybridization chamber of the GeneTAC Hyb4 station (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). The following program was used for hybridization of tRNA fragments: 75 °C (2 min), 60 °C (probe introduction), 90 °C (5 min), 60 °C (16 h hybridization). Following hybridization, the slides were washed on the Hyb4 station twice with 2×SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 50 °C, twice with 0.1×SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 42 °C, and twice with 0.1×SSC at 42 °C. Slides were then removed from the station, rinsed with 0.1×SSC, and dried by centrifugation. They were then exposed to the PhosphorImager to visualize the signals deriving from the hybridized tiRNAs. Microarray slides were imaged using a Fuji BAS scanner. 32P intensities were quantified and corrected for background using Fuji BAS software. The median values for eight replicate spots were obtained for each tRNA and divided by the median value of the two tRNA standards added (E. coli tRNALys and E. coli tRNATyr). S/S cells were treated with recombinant ANG as specified. Total cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of EF1A (Millipore; catalog number 05-235) or eIF2α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog number sc133227), or Ago2 (Millipore; catalog number MABE56), or mouse control antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (19.Bevilacqua E.

A human RNA transcripts database was downloaded from GenBank. Each tRNA probe sequence was divided into 30-nucleotide windows at each sequence position. This created a database of small tRNA fragments that were matched against all human RNA transcripts. The goal was to find all genomic loci that are similar to tRNA sequences (and complementary to the probes in the tRNA array). The matching of the tRNA fragments to the human RNA transcripts database allowed at most one mismatch in matches of at least 28 nt. Western blot analysis was performed using standard procedures. Polyclonal rabbit anti-RNH1 was obtained from Proteintech Group, Inc. The anti-ANG antibody was bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number sc1409). Polyribosome analysis by sucrose gradient sedimentation was carried out as described previously (19.Bevilacqua E. Wang X. Majumder M. Gaccioli F. Yuan C.L. Wang C. Zhu X. Jordan L.E. Scheuner D.

For quality control, ribosomal RNAs were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. mRNAs were monitored by RT-qPCR using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The primer sets used were: ANG_forward, GGCAACAAGAGCAACATCAAGG, and ANG_reverse, AGGCAAACCATTCTCACAGGC; RNH1_forward, GCTGGAGTCACTGTGGATAAAGACC and RNH1_reverse, GTGGGTTGCTGCTCATTTGC; Mcl1_forward, TCAAAGATGGCGTAACAAACTGG and Mcl1_reverse, CCCGTTTCGTCCTTACAAGAAC. It was previously shown that severe hypertonic stress (600 mosmol/liter) caused a global arrest of protein synthesis in S/S and A/A MEFs that is independent of eIF2α phosphorylation (19.Bevilacqua E.

(p. 659 , published online 18 October) have identified a rearguard susceptibility that a necrotrophic fungus exploits. The fungal toxin victorin interacts with the defense protein LOV1 in Arabidopsis and activates it, but the result, counterintuitively, is that the plant succumbs to the disease rather than fighting it off. What seems to be happening is that victorin targets a thioredoxin that regulates the systemic acquired resistance pathway. That interaction triggers activity of LOV1, which in turn incites cell death. The invading fungus then benefits from the ready access to dead cells."

Studies show that the sirtuin SIRT6 promotes inflammation by enhancing TNF expression. Here, we aimed to determine whether SIRT6 is involved in conferring an inflammatory phenotype to cancer cells and to define the mechanisms linking SIRT6 to inflammation. We show that SIRT6 enhances the expression of pro-inflammatory cyto-/chemokines, such as IL8 and TNF, and promotes cell migration in pancreatic cancer cells by enhancing Ca2+ responses. Via its enzymatic activity, SIRT6 increases the intracellular levels of ADP-ribose, an activator of the Ca2+ channel TRPM2. In turn, TRPM2 and Ca2+ are shown to be involved in SIRT6-induced TNF and IL8 expression. SIRT6 increases the nuclear levels of the Ca2+-dependent transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and cyclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor that reduces NFAT activity, reduces TNF and IL8 expression in SIRT6-overexpressing cells. These results implicate a role for SIRT6 in the synthesis of Ca2+-mobilizing second messengers, in the regulation of Ca2+-dependent transcription factors, and in the expression of pro-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic, and chemotactic cytokines.

https://openalex.org/W2116591434,"The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) exists in monomeric and nanoclustered forms independently of antigen binding. Although the clustering is involved in the regulation of T-cell sensitivity, it is unknown how the TCR nanoclusters form. We show that cholesterol is required for TCR nanoclustering in T cells and that this clustering enhances the avidity but not the affinity of the TCR-antigen interaction. Investigating the mechanism of the nanoclustering, we found that radioactive photocholesterol specifically binds to the TCRβ chain in vivo. In order to reduce the complexity of cellular membranes, we used a synthetic biology approach and reconstituted the TCR in liposomes of defined lipid composition. Both cholesterol and sphingomyelin were required for the formation of TCR dimers in phosphatidylcholine-containing large unilamellar vesicles. Further, the TCR was localized in the liquid disordered phase in giant unilamellar vesicles. We propose a model in which cholesterol and sphingomyelin binding to the TCRβ chain causes TCR dimerization. The lipid-induced TCR nanoclustering enhances the avidity to antigen and thus might be involved in enhanced sensitivity of memory compared with naive T cells. Our work contributes to the understanding of the function of specific nonannular lipid-membrane protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2077524199,"The spike protein N-terminal domains (NTDs) of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) recognize sugar and protein receptors, respectively, despite their significant sequence homology. We recently determined the crystal structure of MHV NTD complexed with its protein receptor murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), which surprisingly revealed a human galectin (galactose-binding lectin) fold in MHV NTD. Here, we have determined at 1.55 Å resolution the crystal structure of BCoV NTD, which also has the human galectin fold. Using mutagenesis, we have located the sugar-binding site in BCoV NTD, which overlaps with the galactose-binding site in human galectins. Using a glycan array screen, we have identified 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as the preferred sugar substrate for BCoV NTD. Subtle structural differences between BCoV and MHV NTDs, primarily involving different conformations of receptor-binding loops, explain why BCoV NTD does not bind CEACAM1 and why MHV NTD does not bind sugar. These results suggest a successful viral evolution strategy in which coronaviruses stole a galectin from hosts, incorporated it into their spike protein, and evolved it into viral receptor-binding domains with altered sugar specificity in contemporary BCoV or novel protein specificity in contemporary MHV."

AR stimulated NIH3T3 fibroblast cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Silencing of AR expression by siRNA or chemical inhibition of EGFR signaling, utilizing AG1478 and gefitinib, significantly reduced the ability of TGF-β1 to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and expression of α-smooth muscle actin, collagen, and other extracellular matrix-associated genes. TGF-β1-stimulated activation of Akt, ERK, and Smad signaling was also significantly inhibited by these interventions. Consistent with these in vitro findings, AR expression was impressively increased in the lungs of TGF-β1 transgenic mice, and either siRNA silencing of AR or chemical inhibition of EGFR signaling significantly reduced TGF-β1-stimulated collagen accumulation in the lung. These studies showed a novel regulatory role for AR in the pathogenesis of TGF-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

A quantitative understanding of the contributions of individual pathways and their interactions is needed to better understand hypertrophy signaling and to develop more effective therapies for heart failure. We developed a computational model of the cardiac myocyte hypertrophy signaling network to determine how the components and network topology lead to differential regulation of transcription factors, gene expression, and myocyte size. Our computational model of the hypertrophy signaling network contains 106 species and 193 reactions, integrating 14 established pathways regulating cardiac myocyte growth. 109 of 114 model predictions were validated using published experimental data testing the effects of receptor activation on transcription factors and myocyte phenotypic outputs. Network motif analysis revealed an enrichment of bifan and biparallel cross-talk motifs. Sensitivity analysis was used to inform clustering of the network into modules and to identify species with the greatest effects on cell growth. Many species influenced hypertrophy, but only a few nodes had large positive or negative influences. Ras, a network hub, had the greatest effect on cell area and influenced more species than any other protein in the network. We validated this model prediction in cultured cardiac myocytes. With this integrative computational model, we identified the most influential species in the cardiac hypertrophy signaling network and demonstrate how different levels of network organization affect myocyte size, transcription factors, and gene expression."

To better understand the role of the S1 pocket and the structural basis of drug inhibition and SERT/NET selectivity, we have examined the effect of S1 mutations in human SERT (hSERT) and NET (hNET) for a panel of compounds belonging to different antidepressant drug classes. Specifically, we studied the effect of six single point mutations of key residues surrounding the S1 pocket of hSERT and hNET on the inhibitory potency of 15 structurally and pharmacologically diverse inhibitors (see Figs. 1 and 2). Cluster analysis of the resulting drug activity profiles across each set of transporter mutants reveals distinct sets of drugs that have similar perturbation patterns, suggesting that these share similar binding modes within the S1 pocket. Hereby, we provide information aiding the general understanding of how antidepressants interact with and distinguish between hSERT and hNET at the molecular level. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, trypsin, and penicillin-streptomycin was purchased from Invitrogen. All DNA restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase enzyme were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Cell culture dishes were from Sarstedt AG & Co (Nümbrecht, Germany), and 96-well plates were from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark). [3H]5-HT (27–28 Ci/mmol), [3H]dopamine (DA; 91–139 Ci/mmol), and MicroScint-20 scintillation mixture were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Amitriptyline, atomoxetine, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine, 2-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-5-methyl-phenylamine (MADAM), maprotiline, milnacipran, nisoxetine, paroxetine, (S)-citalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine were kindly provided by H. Lundbeck A/S (Valby, Denmark). The mammalian expression plasmids pcDNA3.1 and pCI-IRES-neo containing hSERT (pcDNA3.1-hSERT) and hNET (pCI-IRES-neo-hNET) cDNA, respectively, have been described previously (24.Kristensen A.S. Larsen M.B. Johnsen L.B. Wiborg O. Mutational scanning of the human serotonin transporter reveals fast translocating serotonin transporter mutants.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Generation of point mutations in pcDNA3.1-hSERT and pCI-IRES-neo-hNET was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations followed by sequencing of the entire hSERT or hNET coding sequence of each mutant construct (MWG Biotech, Martinsried, Germany). To compare cell-surface expression patterns of wild-type (WT) and mutant hSERT and hNET using fluorescence microscopy, transporter constructs with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the intracellular N-terminal region of the transporters were created. For hSERT constructs, the hSERT coding domain sequence (CDS) was PCR-amplified from pcDNA3.1-hSERT with restriction enzyme recognition sites XhoI and HindIII contained upstream and downstream, respectively, relative to the CDS. The PCR fragment was XhoI/HindIII-digested and ligated into a modified version of the GFP fusion protein cloning vector pGFP2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using XhoI and HindIII sites to generate pGFP2-GFP2-hSERT, in which the GFP and hSERT CDS are fused. Subsequently, the GFP-hSERT CDS was excised from pGFP2-GFP2-hSERT by NheI and ligated into NheI-digested pcDNA3.1-hSERT generating pcDNA3.1-GFP2-hSERT. Subsequently, fragments containing the individual point mutations in the hSERT CDS were excised from their parent mutant pcDNA3.1-hSERT constructs using BlpI and XbaI and ligated into BlpI/XbaI-digested pcDNA3.1-GFP2-hSERT, generating pcDNA3.1-GFP2-hSERT constructs containing point mutations in the hSERT CDS. For generation of GFP-tagged hNET constructs, the CDS of GFP was excised from pGFP2-C1 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with NheI and EcoRI and ligated into NheI/EcoRI-digested pCI-IRES-neo-hNET generating pCI-IRES-neo-GFP2-hNET. Subsequently, the CDS containing the individual point mutations in hNET was excised from the mutant pCI-IRES-neo-hNET constructs using EcoRI and NotI and ligated into EcoRI/NotI digested pCI-IRES-neo-GFP2-hNET providing pCI-IRES-neo-GFP2-hNET constructs containing point mutations in the hNET CDS. The sequence integrity of all GFP-fusion constructs was verified by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotech). COS7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment. COS7 cells were transfected using TransIT DNA transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). Before transfection, confluent cells growing in 150-mm tissue culture dishes were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3), and the cells were then detached with 2 ml of trypsin followed by resuspension of cells in growth medium at a concentration of 6 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were then immediately mixed with transfection reagent/DNA complex, which was prepared immediately before use according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, per 96-well plate, 5 μg of DNA and 15 μl of transfection reagent were mixed in 0.5 ml of DMEM and incubated at 20 °C for 20 min. The combined cell suspension and transfection reagent/DNA mixture was subsequently plated into white 96-well tissue culture plates (50 μl of cell suspension per well corresponding to 30,000 cells) and transferred into the 37 °C humidified 5% CO2 environment until use in functional assays. Under these conditions, the transfection efficiency was between 40 to 90% as assessed by visual inspection of cells transfected with GFP2-hSERT and GFP2-hNET (data not shown). Uptake assays were performed 40–48 h after transfection, and all washing steps were performed using an automated plate washer (ELx50, Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Before uptake experiments, cells were washed twice with 300 μl of PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (PBSCM) and allowed to pre-equilibrate at 20 °C for 20 to 30 min in 50 μl of PBSCM per well. In all NET assays, the PBSCM buffer was supplemented with 1 mm l-ascorbic acid. The time course of uptake into transfected COS7 cells was initially assessed for each construct by measuring accumulation of radiolabeled substrate over increasing time periods (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2); 40 μl PBSCM was added to each well, and uptake was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of PBSCM containing [3H]5-HT (for SERT assays) or [3H]DA (for NET assays), respectively, giving a final substrate concentration of 50 nm. For time kinetics experiments, eight sets of triplicate wells were incubated at 20 °C for increasing time periods (0.5–20 min), and uptake was terminated by aspiration and rapid washing of wells three times with 300 μl of PBSCM. For transport inhibition experiments to determine IC50 (for calculation of Ki), eight sets of triplicate wells were preincubated in 40 μl of PBSCM per well with 0 or increasing concentration of inhibitors at 20 °C for 30 min before the addition of 20 μl of PBSCM containing [3H]5-HT (for SERT assays) or [3H]DA (for NET assays) giving a final substrate concentration of 50 nm. Uptake was allowed to proceed at 20 °C for 5 min before uptake were terminated as described above. For determination of Km values, eight sets of triplicate wells were incubated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled 5-HT (for SERT assays) or DA (NET assays) in PBSCM and a fixed concentration of 50 nm [3H]5-HT (for SERT assays) or [3H]DA (for NET assays) at 20 °C for 5 min. For all transport assays, the amount of accumulated radioligand per well was determined by solubilizing cells in 50 μl of scintillant solution (MicroScint20) and subjected to at least 1 h of vigorous shaking. Radioactivity was determined by counting of plates in a Packard TopCounter (Packard Instrument Co.). For cells transfected with WT transporters, total specific uptake of [3H]substrate typically ranged between 4000 and 6000 counts per min (cpm) per well, corresponding to 125–180 and 40–55 fmol of substrate per well for WT hSERT and WT hNET, respectively. For each experiment, nonspecific uptake (“background”) was determined by assaying triplicate wells with non-transfected cells in parallel. Typically, accumulated radioactivity in non-transfected cells was between 100 and 500 cpm per well. Specific uptake was calculated by subtracting nonspecific uptake from total uptake. The uptake level was in all experiments no more than 10% that of total added 3H substrate, and experiments yielding a ratio of specific to nonspecific uptake less than 4:1 were discarded. A Leica SP2 confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser, a helium/neon laser, and a 63×/1.17 oil immersion objective was used. 24–48 h after transfection, COS7 cells were re-plated in 12-well glass-bottom plates (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and incubated for 2 h to adhere. 30 min before imaging, cells were stained with CellMaskTM Deep Red plasma membrane stain (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. GFP-tagged WT and mutant transporters were visualized using the 488-nm argon laser line at 25–35% input power as the excitation source and measurement of emission in the 500–560-nm spectrum range. Cell membrane stain was visualized using the 633-nm helium/neon laser line at 25–35% input power and collection of emission in the 640–700-nm spectrum range. Overlay images were produced with Leica LAS AF lite software (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar Germany). Data and statistical analyses were performed using Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA) and R (25Team, R. D. C., (2010) R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria,Google Scholar) software. For determination of IC50 values, dose-response data obtained from [3H]5-HT or [3H]DA uptake inhibition experiments were fitted by the equation, % Specific uptake=100/(1+10((loglC50−log[inhibitor]) × Hill slope))(Eq. 1) where IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor that produces a half-maximal inhibition of uptake. For determination of the Michaelis-Menten constant, data from Km assays were fitted by the equation, % Specific uptake=100/(1+10((logKm−log[L]) × Hill slope))(Eq. 2) where [L] is the concentration of substrate. IC50 values were converted to Ki-values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (26.Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Relationship between the inhibition constant (K1) and the concentration of inhibitor which causes 50 per cent inhibition (I50) of an enzymatic reaction.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12266) Google Scholar), Ki=IC50/(1+([L]/Km))(Eq. 3) where [L] is the concentration of substrate. WT transporters were always assayed in parallel with mutants, and Ki-fold changes were calculated from paired determinations. For both SERT and NET, the -fold changes in Ki of the 15 inhibitors between mutant and WT transporter were hierarchically clustered using mapping of Euclidean distance between each pair of mutant vectors, consisting of six positional mutants per vector. The implementation was carried out using the statistical software R (25Team, R. D. C., (2010) R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria,Google Scholar) with the stats and pvclust packages (27.Suzuki R. Shimodaira H. Pvclust. An R package for assessing the uncertainty in hierarchical clustering.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1540-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar) with standard settings. To assess the confidence of the generated clusters, we used cluster bootstrapping, resampling the data 1000 times using the pvclust package with p > 0.95 as a threshold to select stable clusters, meaning that the cluster is present in >95% of the bootstrap replicates (27.Suzuki R. Shimodaira H. Pvclust. An R package for assessing the uncertainty in hierarchical clustering.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1540-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the S1 binding pocket in hSERT and hNET for the inhibitory function of antidepressant drugs, we characterized a panel of 15 SERT and NET inhibitors (Fig. 1) at hSERT and hNET single point mutations of key residues within the S1 pocket (Figs. 2 and 3; see Tables 2 and 3). Our selection of compounds aimed to cover structurally diverse SERT/NET inhibitors with distinct selectivity profiles and included two highly selective pharmacological tool compounds (MADAM and nisoxetine) and 13 antidepressant drugs, classified according to their pharmacological profile as selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective NE reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), or dual acting 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Fig. 1). The selection of S1 residues for mutation as well as the amino acid substitutions (Fig. 4) were guided by results from previous mutational studies of rodent and human SERT and NET (17.Andersen J.

https://openalex.org/W2134277586,"Liver mitochondria undergo dynamic alterations following chronic alcohol feeding to mice. Intragastric alcohol feeding to mice resulted in 1) increased state III respiration (109% compared with control) in isolated liver mitochondria, probably due to increased levels of complexes I, IV, and V being incorporated into the respiratory chain; 2) increased mitochondrial NAD(+) and NADH levels (∼2-fold), with no change in the redox status; 3) alteration in mitochondrial morphology, with increased numbers of elongated mitochondria; and 4) enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in the liver, which corresponded with an up-regulation of PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α). Oral alcohol feeding to mice, which is associated with less liver injury and steatosis, slightly enhanced respiration in isolated liver mitochondria (30.8% compared with control), lower than the striking increase caused by intragastric alcohol feeding. Mitochondrial respiration increased with both oral and intragastric alcohol feeding despite extensive N-acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. The alcohol-induced mitochondrial alterations are probably an adaptive response to enhance alcohol metabolism in the liver. Isolated liver mitochondria from alcohol-treated mice had a greater rate of acetaldehyde metabolism and respiration when treated with acetaldehyde than control. Aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 levels were unaltered in response to alcohol, suggesting that the greater acetaldehyde metabolism by isolated mitochondria from alcohol-treated mice was due to increased mitochondrial respiration that regenerated NAD(+), the rate-limiting substrate in alcohol/acetaldehyde metabolism. Overall, our work suggests that mitochondrial plasticity in the liver may be an important adaptive response to the metabolic stress caused by alcohol intake and could potentially play a role in many other vital functions performed by the liver."

https://openalex.org/W2077340332,"Desensitization of FSH response by down-regulation of FSHR transcription is critical for FSH action.Chromatin modifier MTA2 participates in the down-regulation of FSHR transcription.The FSH/Ar/MTA2 cascade may serve as an indispensable negative feedback mechanism to modulate FSH transduction events in Sertoli cells.Our findings provide new insights into mechanisms by which FSH is deregulated in male infertile patients. The effect of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on spermatogenesis is modulated at a fundamental level by controlling the number of competent receptors present at the surface of Sertoli cells (SCs). One underlying mechanism is the down-regulation of the expression levels of the FSH receptor (FSHR) gene after exposure to FSH. Here we report that metastasis-associated protein 2 (MTA2), a component of histone deacetylase and nucleosome-remodeling complexes, as a gene product induced directly by testosterone or indirectly by FSH, is exclusively expressed in SCs. Stimulation of SCs with FSH is accompanied by up-regulation of MTA2 expression and enhancement of deacetylase activity. This effect requires the integrity of functional androgen receptor. Furthermore, MTA2 is a potent corepressor of FSHR transcription, because it can recruit histone deacetylase-1 onto the FSHR promoter and participates in the down-regulation of FSHR expression upon FSH treatment. Abolishment of endogenous MTA2 by siRNA treatment disrupted the desensitization of the FSH response and thereafter impaired the FSH-dependent secretory function of SCs. From a clinical standpoint, deregulated expression of MTA2 in SCs of human pathological testes negatively correlates to the deregulated level of serum FSH. Overall, our present results provide the first evidence that the FSH/androgen receptor/MTA2 cascade may serve as an indispensable negative feedback mechanism to modulate the transduction events of SCs in response to FSH. These data also underscore an unexpected reproductive facet of MTA2, which may operate as a novel integrator linking synergistic actions of FSH and androgen signaling in SCs."
https://openalex.org/W1985842539,"Rab GTPases are master regulators of membrane trafficking events and template the directionality of protein transport through the secretory and endocytic pathways. Certain Rabs recruit the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates a subsequent acting Rab protein in a given pathway; this process has been termed a Rab cascade. We show here that the medial Golgi-localized Rab33B GTPase has the potential to link functionally to the late Golgi, Rab6 GTPase, by its capacity for association with Ric1 and Rgp1 proteins. In yeast, Ric1p and Rgp1p form a complex that catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange by Ypt6p, the Rab6 homolog. Human Ric1 and Rgp1 both bind Rab6A with preference for the GDP-bound conformation, characteristic of a GEF. Nevertheless, both Ric1 and Rgp1 proteins are needed to catalyze nucleotide exchange on Rab6A protein. Ric1 and Rgp1 form a complex, but unlike their yeast counterparts, most of the subunits are not associated, and most of the proteins are cytosolic. Loss of Ric1 or Rgp1 leads to destabilization of Rab6, concomitant with a block in Rab6-dependent retrograde transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors to the Golgi. The C terminus of Ric1 protein contains a distinct binding site for Rab33B-GTP, supporting the existence of a Rab cascade between the medial and trans Golgi. This study thus identifies a GEF for Rab6A in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2158619126,"The mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing component (mARC) was recently discovered as the fifth eukaryotic molybdenum cofactor-containing enzyme. The human genome encodes two mARC proteins, mARC1 and mARC2, sharing significant homologies with respect to sequence and function. Whereas mARC2 was identified as a mitochondrial enzyme, the subcellular localization of mARC1 has remained uncharacterized, although the similarity of both proteins suggested identical subcellular localizations. In addition, neither mARC1 nor mARC2 could be attributed unambiguously to one of the four mitochondrial subcompartments. Accordingly, mechanisms triggering the subcellular distribution of both enzymes have been unexplored so far. Here, we shed light on the subcellular localization of mARC1 and demonstrate that it is integrated into the outer mitochondrial membrane. The C-terminal catalytic domain of the protein remains exposed to the cytosol and confers an N((in))-C((out)) membrane orientation of mARC1. This localization is triggered by the N terminus of the enzyme, being composed of a weak N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and a downstream transmembrane helix. We demonstrate the transmembrane domain of mARC1 to be sufficient for mitochondrial targeting and the N-terminal targeting signal to function as a supportive receptor for the outer mitochondrial membrane. According to its localization and targeting mechanism, we classify mARC1 as a novel signal-anchored mitochondrial protein. During mitochondrial import, mARC1 is not processed, and membrane integration proceeds membrane potential independently but requires external ATP, which finally results in the assembly of mARC1 into high oligomeric protein complexes."

We previously demonstrated that hTRF2 is a double strand telomere binding protein that forms t-loops in vitro and recognizes three- and four-way junctions independent of DNA sequence. How the DNA binding characteristics of hTRF2 to DNA is altered in the presence of hRap1 however is not known. Here we utilized EM and quantitative gel retardation to characterize the DNA binding properties of hRap1 and the TRF2-Rap1 complex. Both gel filtration chromatography and mass analysis from two-dimensional projections showed that the TRF2-Rap1 complex exists in solution and binds to DNA as a complex consisting of four monomers each of hRap1 and hTRF2. EM revealed for the first time that hRap1 binds to DNA templates in the absence of hTRF2 with a preference for double strand-single strand junctions in a sequence independent manner. When hTRF2 and hRap1 are in a complex, its affinity for ds telomeric sequences is 2-fold higher than TRF2 alone and more than 10-fold higher for telomeric 3′ ends. This suggests that as hTRF2 recruits hRap1 to telomeric sequences, hRap1 alters the affinity of hTRF2 and its binding preference on telomeric DNA. Moreover, the TRF2-Rap1 complex has higher ability to re-model telomeric DNA than either component alone. This finding underlies the importance of complex formation between hRap1 and hTRF2 for telomere function and end protection. The TRF2-Rap1 complex suppresses non-homologous end joining and interacts with DNAPK-C to prevent end joining. We previously demonstrated that hTRF2 is a double strand telomere binding protein that forms t-loops in vitro and recognizes three- and four-way junctions independent of DNA sequence. How the DNA binding characteristics of hTRF2 to DNA is altered in the presence of hRap1 however is not known. Here we utilized EM and quantitative gel retardation to characterize the DNA binding properties of hRap1 and the TRF2-Rap1 complex.

In this work, using complementary experimental approaches, we identified the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a C1q partner when exposed at the surface of human pathogenic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and human apoptotic cells. The membrane-associated GAPDH on HeLa cells bound the globular regions of C1q as demonstrated by pulldown and cell surface co-localization experiments. Pneumococcal strains deficient in surface-exposed GAPDH harbored a decreased level of C1q recognition when compared with the wild-type strains. Both recombinant human and pneumococcal GAPDHs interacted avidly with C1q as measured by surface plasmon resonance experiments (K(D) = 0.34-2.17 nm). In addition, GAPDH-C1q complexes were observed by transmission electron microscopy after cross-linking. The purified pneumococcal GAPDH protein activated C1 in an in vitro assay unlike the human form. Deposition of C1q, C3b, and C4b from human serum at the surface of pneumococcal cells was dependent on the presence of surface-exposed GAPDH. This ability of C1q to sense both human and bacterial GAPDHs sheds new insights on the role of this important defense collagen molecule in modulating the immune response."

In addition, reduced BRCA1 protein is associated with sporadic cancer cases in these tissues. At the cellular level, BRCA1 plays a critical role in multiple cellular functions such as DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control. Its protein level is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. However, regulation of BRCA1 protein stability is not fully understood. Our earlier study showed that the amino terminus of BRCA1 harbors a degron sequence that is sufficient and necessary for conferring BRCA1 degradation. In the current study, we used mass spectrometry to identify Skp1 that regulates BRCA1 protein stability. Small interfering RNA screening that targets all human F-box proteins uncovered FBXO44 as an important protein that influences BRCA1 protein level. The Skp1-Cul1-F-box-protein44 (SCFFBXO44) complex ubiquitinates full-length BRCA1 in vitro. Furthermore, the N terminus of BRCA1 mediates the interaction between BRCA1 and FBXO44. Overexpression of SCFFBXO44 reduces BRCA1 protein level. Taken together, our work strongly suggests that SCFFBXO44 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for BRCA1 degradation.

Germ-line mutations of BRCA1 predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers. Studies in the past eighteen years have implicated BRCA1 in several important cellular functions including DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation (1.King M.

In particular, it has been shown that BRCA1 protein is degraded via a proteasome-dependent mechanism in G1 phase of the cell cycle (3.Choudhury A.D. Xu H. Baer R.

In addition, we previously showed that BRCA1 is ubiquitinated and degraded during steroidogenesis in ovarian granulosa cells, which results in relief of BRCA1-mediated repression on steroidogenic gene expression (4.Lu Y.

While this is likely contributed by promoter hypermethylation and thus reduced transcription of the BRCA1 gene (6.Catteau A. Harris W.H. Xu C.F. Solomon E.

BRCA1 encodes a protein of 1863 amino acids with two recognizable features: the N-terminal RING finger and the C-terminal BRCT domains (13.Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A.

Missense cancer mutations of BRCA1 predominantly cluster in these two domains, highlighting their importance in the tumor suppressor function of the protein. The N-terminal RING domain interacts with another BRCT-containing protein, BARD1; and the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer possesses intrinsic ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that can auto-ubiquitinate BRCA1 (14.Baer R.

As the bulk of cellular BRCA1 and BARD1 exist as a heterodimer and degradation of the two proteins can be triggered by the same signaling (4.Lu Y. Amleh A. Sun J. Jin X. McCullough S.D. Baer R.

The Skp1-Cul1-F-box-protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase is one of the most characterized mammalian E3 ligases. Extensive SCF studies reveal a well-conserved architecture for the multi-subunits of SCF complexes, with the divergent F-box proteins dictating substrate specificity (21.Cardozo T. Pagano M.

The F-box proteins are further classified into three subfamilies: FBWs that contain WD-40 repeats and recognize specific Ser/Thr phosphorylation consensus sequences; FBLs contain leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and also seem to prefer phosphorylated substrates characterized so far; and the rest of the F-box protein family (FBXs) that lack either WD-40 repeats or LRRs (21.Cardozo T.

SDS-PAGE slices were excised and digested by trypsin. The resulting peptides were extracted and analyzed by nanoscale LC-MS/MS on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). MS/MS spectra were searched against a protein target-decoy database for the identification of peptides/proteins. The search results were filtered to reduce protein false discovery rate to less than 0.1%.

BRCA1 stability was measured in the presence of cycloheximide after FBXO44 or Skp1 knockdown. 24 h after siRNA transfection, cells were split into multiple dishes. 72 h after siRNA transfection, cycloheximide was added (100 μg/ml), and cells were harvested at the indicated times. HEK293T cells transfected with siRNA oligos were split to two 60-mm dishes 24 h after transfection. Cells were transfected again 24 h later with either pcDNA3-BRCA1-#1-N and empty vector or pcDNA3-BRCA1-#1-N and Topo-His-HA-Ub. 18 h after second DNA transfection, MG132 was added (5 μm). Cells were harvested 72 h after siRNA transfection and lysed in a phosphate/guanidine buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 6.4; 100 mm NaCl; 10 mm imidazole; with freshly added 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide) with mild sonication. The ubiquitinated proteins were precipitated with Ni-NTA-agarose (QIA-GEN, Chatsworth, CA), followed by four washes with buffer (8 m urea; 50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0; 100 mm NaCl). The precipitated proteins were eluted with NTA buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 200 mm imidazole; 5% SDS; 30% glycerol; 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol; 0.004% bromphenol blue), resolved by 17% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with α-BRCA1 antibody. Recombinant SCFControl and SCFFBXO44 complexes were isolated from transfected 293T cells, as previously described (28.Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.-A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Human F-box protein hCdc4 targets cyclin E for proteolysis and is mutated in a breast cancer cell line.Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Components of the SCF complex (Myc-Skp1, Myc-Cul1, Myc-Roc1, and Flag-FBXO44) were expressed in HEK293T cells and immunopurified with anti-FLAG M2 beads (50% slurry) and used in an in vitro Ub ligation assay. HEK293T cells that stably expressed Flag-BRCA1 (≈1 × 107 cells) were lysed by a brief sonication in 1 ml of Flag lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors mixture, and deubiquitinase inhibitors (10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 nm ubiquitin aldehyde) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads. The beads were washed three times with FLAG lysis buffer and once with Nonidet P-40 buffer III. Percipitated SCFControl or SCFFBXO44 was mixed with the Flag-BRCA1 immobilized on Flag-beads. Beads were washed once with ubiquitination reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF). 20 μl of ubiquitination reaction mix was added to each tube, which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 2 μg of ubiquitin (Boston Biochem, U-100), 100 ng E1 (Boston Biochem, E-304), 400 ng E2-UbcH5b, (Boston Biochem, E2-622). Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C with agitation at 425 rpm. To terminate reaction, 8 ml 4× LDS (Invitrogen, NP0007) with DTT was added to the reaction mixture and inclubated 10min at 70 °C. Samples were separated on 3–8% gradient Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen), and blotted with BRCA1 antibody (OP92; Calbiochem). Breast cancer samples and adjacent noncancerous tissues were obtained from 307 Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences with the informed consent of patients and with IRB approval. The expression of FBXO44 and BRCA1 in the clinical samples was detected by immunohistochemistry as described previously (29.Zhang H. Xie X. Zhu X. Zhu J. Hao C. Lu Q. Ding L. Liu Y. Zhou L. Liu Y. Huang C.C. Wen C. Ye Q. Stimulatory cross-talk between NFAT3 and estrogen receptor in breast cancer cells.J. Biol.

Briefly, the antigens were retrieved by autoclaving the sections in citric acids buffer and incubated with rabbit anti-FBXO44 antibody (Sigma) or mouse anti-BRCA1 antibody (Calbiochem) at a dilution of 1/100 (anti-FBXO44) or 1/50 (anti-BRCA1) for 1h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected by the addition of biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.. The color was developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. The sections were counterstained using hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, and sealed. For negative controls, normal rabbit or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or PBS was substituted for the primary antibody. The expression of FBXO44 and BRCA1 was classified into two categories, depending on the percentage of cells stained and/or the intensity of staining: −, 0–10% positive tumor cells; +, >10% positive tumor cells. Differences between variables in immunohistochemistry were assessed by χ2 analysis. Statistical calculations were performed using SPSS 13.0. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Our earlier studies identified a degron sequence within the BRCA1 N terminus that mediates BRCA1 degradation. To identify potential ubiquitin ligases that recognize the BRCA1 degron and subsequently target it for degradation, we employed tandem affinity purification (TAP) of BRCA1 N-terminal 324aa fragment (BRCA1#1) overexpressed in HEK293T cells, followed by mass spectrometry analysis of BRCA1#1-associated proteins. The BRCA1#1 fragment was tagged in tandem by sequences derived from calmodulin-binding protein (CBP) and streptavidin-binding protein (SBP), resulting in a fusion of CBP-SBP-BRCA1#1. Similar to the untagged BRCA1#1, CBP-SBP-BRCA1#1 was also stabilized by the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the proteasome-mediated degradation of the BRCA1 degron was not affected by the addition of CBP and SBP tags. BRCA1#1 was the predominant species after affinity purification (Fig. 1B). Mass spectrometry of BRCA1-associated proteins indicates the presence of BARD1 (data not shown). In addition, Skp1, a key component in SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase, was also among the proteins associated with BRCA1#1. To confirm the mass spectrometry result, TAP purification of BRCA1#1 was repeated, and Skp1 was indeed enriched in BRCA1#1 eluate, as independently verified by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). The interaction between BRCA1 and Skp1 was further validated by coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Flag-tagged full-length BRCA1 was transiently transfected into HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated by an anti-Flag antibody, the endogenous Skp1 was coimmunoprecipitated in either high salt lysis buffer (HSL) or RIPA buffer (Fig. 2A). Conversely, when Flag-Skp1 was immunoprecipitated by an anti-Flag antibody, ectopically expressed full-length BRCA1 (untagged) was also specifically coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 2B). To determine whether steady-state level of the endogenous BRCA1 could be regulated by Skp1, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knock down Skp1. Reduction of Skp1 protein led to accumulation of BRCA1 protein (Fig. 2D) without affecting the BRCA1 mRNA level (Fig. 2C), consistent with the notion that Skp1 might regulate BRCA1 protein stability. Since Skp1 functions as part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes, we used a dominant negative mutant of Cul1, another key component of SCF, to further dissect the relationship between BRCA1 protein level and SCF ligases. Consistent with published data (30.Jin J. Ang X.L."
https://openalex.org/W2071250771,"Mutations in SCN1A, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V)1.1, are the most common cause of severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) or Dravet syndrome. SMEI is most often associated with premature truncations of Na(V)1.1 that cause loss of function, but nontruncating mutations also occur. We hypothesized that some nontruncating mutations might impair trafficking of Na(V)1.1 to the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrated that seven nontruncating missense or in-frame deletion mutations (L986F, delF1289, R1648C, F1661S, G1674R, and G1979E) exhibited reduced cell surface expression relative to wild type (WT) Na(V)1.1 consistent with impaired trafficking. We tested whether two commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, lamotrigine), as well as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) trafficking corrector VRT-325, could rescue cell surface and functional expression of two representative Na(V)1.1 mutants (R1648C, G1674R). Treatment of cells with phenytoin increased cell surface expression of WT-Na(V)1.1 and both mutant channels, whereas lamotrigine only increased surface expression of R1648C. VRT-325 did not alter surface expression of WT-Na(V)1.1 or mutant channels. Although phenytoin increased surface expression of G1674R, channel function was not restored, suggesting that this mutation also causes an intrinsic loss of function. Both phenytoin and lamotrigine increased functional expression of R1648C, but lamotrigine also increased persistent sodium current evoked by this mutation. Our findings indicate that certain nontruncating SCN1A mutations associated with SMEI have impaired cell surface expression and that some alleles may be amenable to pharmacological rescue of this defect. However, rescue of dysfunctional Na(V)1.1 channels to the plasma membrane could contribute to exacerbating rather than ameliorating the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2094788670,"Myocardial constitutive No production depends on the activity of both endothelial and neuronal NOS (eNOS and nNOS, respectively). Stimulation of myocardial β(3)-adrenergic receptor (β(3)-AR) produces a negative inotropic effect that is dependent on eNOS. We evaluated whether nNOS also plays a role in β(3)-AR signaling and found that the β(3)-AR-mediated reduction in cell shortening and [Ca(2+)](i) transient amplitude was abolished both in eNOS(-/-) and nNOS(-/-) left ventricular (LV) myocytes and in wild type LV myocytes after nNOS inhibition with S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline. LV superoxide (O(2)(·-)) production was increased in nNOS(-/-) mice and reduced by L-N(ω)-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), indicating uncoupling of eNOS activity. eNOS S-glutathionylation and Ser-1177 phosphorylation were significantly increased in nNOS(-/-) myocytes, whereas myocardial tetrahydrobiopterin, eNOS Thr-495 phosphorylation, and arginase activity did not differ between genotypes. Although inhibitors of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) or NOX2 NADPH oxidase caused a similar reduction in myocardial O(2)(·-), only XOR inhibition reduced eNOS S-glutathionylation and Ser-1177 phosphorylation and restored both eNOS coupled activity and the negative inotropic and [Ca(2+)](i) transient response to β(3)-AR stimulation in nNOS(-/-) mice. In summary, our data show that increased O(2)(·-) production by XOR selectively uncouples eNOS activity and abolishes the negative inotropic effect of β(3)-AR stimulation in nNOS(-/-) myocytes. These findings provide unequivocal evidence of a functional interaction between the myocardial constitutive NOS isoforms and indicate that aspects of the myocardial phenotype of nNOS(-/-) mice result from disruption of eNOS signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2016237474,"We determined the role of carboxyl-terminal regulation of NOPR (nociceptin, orphanin FQ receptor) signaling and function. We mutated C-terminal serine and threonine residues and examined their role in NOPR trafficking, homologous desensitization, and arrestin-dependent MAPK signaling. The NOPR agonist, nociceptin, caused robust NOPR-YFP receptor internalization, peaking at 30 min. Mutation of serine 337, 346, and 351, had no effect on NOPR internalization. However, mutation of C-terminal threonine 362, serine 363, and threonine 365 blocked nociceptin-induced internalization of NOPR. Furthermore, point mutation of only Ser-363 was sufficient to block NOPR internalization. Homologous desensitization of NOPR-mediated calcium channel blockade and inhibition of cAMP were also shown to require Ser-363. Additionally, NOPR internalization was absent when GRK3, and Arrestin3 were knocked down using siRNA, but not when GRK2 and Arrestin2 were knocked down. We also found that nociceptin-induced NOPR-mediated JNK but not ERK signaling requires Ser-363, GRK3, and Arrestin3. Dominant-positive Arrestin3 but not Arrestin2 was sufficient to rescue NOPR-S363A internalization and JNK signaling. These findings suggest that NOPR function may be regulated by GRK3 phosphorylation of Ser-363 and Arrestin3 and further demonstrates the complex nature of G-protein-dependent and -independent signaling in opioid receptors."

SKs from cluster 1 (SK1) and cluster 2b (SK2b) display significant evolutionary and functional differences, and attempts to relate these properties to GAS skin or pharynx tropism and invasiveness are of great interest. In this study, using four purified SKs from each cluster, new relationships between plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M (PAM) protein and SK2b have been revealed. All SK1 proteins efficiently activated hPg, whereas all subclass SK2b proteins only weakly activated hPg in the absence of PAM. Surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that the lower affinity of SK2b to hPg served as the basis for the attenuated activation of hPg by SK2b. Binding of hPg to either human fibrinogen (hFg) or PAM greatly enhanced activation of hPg by SK2b but minimally influenced the already effective activation of hPg by SK1. Activation of hPg in the presence of GAS cells containing PAM demonstrated that PAM is the only factor on the surface of SK2b-expressing cells that enabled the direct activation of hPg by SK2b. As the binding of hPg to PAM is necessary for hPg activation by SK2b, this dependence explains the coinherant relationship between PAM and SK2b and the ability of these particular strains to generate the proteolytic activity that disrupts the innate barriers that limit invasiveness.

Here, we report the co-expression and co-crystallization of the 14-3-3β and ChREBP N-terminal regulatory region (residues 1–250) and the crystal structure determination of the complex at 2.4 Å resolution. Our results show that ChREBP binds to 14-3-3β through the primary binding site, the α2 helix. A free sulfate or phosphate ion is found at the interface between ChREBP and 14-3-3 and likely contributes to the tight binding of the two proteins. The 14-3-3β·ChREBP complex represents a novel interaction mode of a 14-3-3 protein with its target protein and provides new insights into the mechanism by which 14-3-3 regulates ChREBP function. The full-length mouse 14-3-3β and the N-terminal region of ChREBP (residues 1–250) containing two phosphoserine mimetic mutations, S140D and S196D, were cloned into the pETDuet vector (Novagen). The ChREBP fragment was inserted into the first multiple cloning site (MCS1) between EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites, and 14-3-3β was cloned into the MCS2 between the NdeI and XhoI sites. The resultant plasmid was transformed into BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) Escherichia coli cells and grown at 32 °C until absorption at 600 nm reached 0.6. Protein expression was induced with the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and cells were left to grow overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Roche Applied Science), and 5 mm imidazole (Buffer A). Clarified cell lysate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. After washing with Buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole, the bound protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole. The resulting protein complex was treated with thrombin (Hematologic Technologies, Inc.) and further purified using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT and then concentrated to 20 mg/ml for crystallization. Crystals of the 14-3-3β·ChREBP complex were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. A 1.5-μl protein at a concentration of 20 mg/ml was mixed with 1.5 μl of well solution containing 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.5, 200 mm sodium/potassium tartrate, and 2.2 m ammonium sulfate and equilibrated against the well at 20 °C. Crystals grew to a maximum size of 0.2 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm3 after 3 days and were cryoprotected by dipping the crystals into 2.2 m lithium sulfate and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at beamline 19-ID, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL. Data were processed using the program HKL2000 (27.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Mutant 14-3-3β was constructed in plasmid pET21 and expressed in BL21 codon plus (DE3). FLAG-tagged full-length ChREBP or the indicated ChREBP mutants were expressed in HEK293T cells using the mammalian expression vector pExchange5A (Stratagene) (20.Sakiyama H. Wynn R.M. Lee W.R.

Cells containing overexpressed ChREBP or ChREBP mutants were then lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were purified by incubating with M2 beads bearing anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) in the binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. For analysis of mutant 14-3-3β binding to wild-type ChREBP, the beads with bound FLAG-ChREBP were incubated with the purified 14-3-3β mutants in 500 μl of the binding buffer for 1.5 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were then washed three times with the same binding buffer without BSA followed by elution with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The eluted samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred to Trans-Blot nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman) for Western blotting. The following primary antibodies were used to detect 14-3-3 proteins and FLAG-ChREBP, respectively, pan-14-3-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-FLAG (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used as the secondary antibody, and bound proteins were visualized with the ECL Western blotting detection system (Pierce). ITC experiments were carried out using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal/GE Healthcare). His-tagged human wild-type (WT) and mutant (R62A and E182A) 14-3-3β were dialyzed overnight into a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. All titration experiments were performed in the same dialysis buffer. A synthetic ChREBP peptide of residues 117–140(S140P) containing the α2 helix and phosphorylated Ser(P)-140 was used in the binding assay. The peptide at 300 μm concentration was injected in 12-μl increments into the reaction cell containing 1.4 ml of 30 μm WT or mutant 14-3-3β proteins. The binding isotherm derived from heat changes was used to calculate the dissociation constant Kd and enthalpy (ΔH0) values with the ORIGIN version 7.0 software (MicroCal/GE Healthcare). The concentrations for WT and mutant 14-3-3 proteins were determined by using the colorimetric Coomassie Blue protein reagent. To understand the interactions between 14-3-3 and ChREBP, and how 14-3-3 regulates the function of ChREBP, we reconstituted a complex of 14-3-3β and ChREBP N-terminal regulatory region (residues 1–250, see Fig. 1) by co-expressing and co-purifying the two proteins. The N-terminal region of ChREBP binds tightly and stably to 14-3-3β, as demonstrated by the presence of both ChREBP and 14-3-3β in the same fractions after several steps of purification, including Ni2+ affinity purification, thrombin treatment, and size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). Both proteins were also present in the crystals (Fig. 1B). Notably, the ChREBP band on SDS-PAGE had a molecular mass of ∼14 kDa, smaller than what was expected for the 250 amino acids encoded in the construct. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectral analysis revealed that the ChREBP fragment in the crystal had a mass of 13,977 kDa and consisted of residues from 81 to 196, a region encompassing all three previously predicted α helices, α1, α2, and α3, the NES2 and the nuclear localization signal regulatory elements (Fig. 1A). However, after the complex structure was determined and refined, only residues 117–137 of ChREBP, containing the α2 helix, are structured and visible in the electron density map (Fig. 1C). Apparently, the regions outside α2 are flexible or disordered in the crystal. This observation is consistent with the lack of a well defined structured domain in this region of ChREBP despite the presence of three predicted α helices. The overall conformations of the 14-3-3β protein in the complex with ChREBP is similar to those reported previously (22.Yang X. Lee W.H. Sobott F. Papagrigoriou E. Robinson C.V. Grossmann J.G. Sundström M. Doyle D.A. Elkins J.M. Structural basis for protein-protein interactions in the 14-3-3 protein family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17237-17242Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and contains nine α helices (from αA to αI) arranged into a right-handed superhelical bundle with the conserved peptide-binding groove located at the concave face of the protein (Fig. 2). Previously the structures of apo-14-3-3β and its complex with non-phosphorylated Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzyme S (ExoS) peptide have been reported (22.Yang X. Lee W.H. Sobott F. Papagrigoriou E. Robinson C.V. Grossmann J.G. Sundström M. Doyle D.A. Elkins J.M. Structural basis for protein-protein interactions in the 14-3-3 protein family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17237-17242Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The root mean square deviations between Cα atoms of these 14-3-3β proteins and the 14-3-3β bound to ChREBP presented here are only ∼0.4 Å, indicating that they adopt essentially identical conformation. In the crystal structure of 14-3-3β·ChREBP complex, the α2 helix of ChREBP is wedged between the third (αC) and the last (αI) helices of 14-3-3β (Fig. 2) and oriented roughly parallel to both αC and αI helices. The 14-3-3β in complex with ChREBP retained its dimer conformation, and the two 14-3-3β monomers in the dimer are related by a strict crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (Fig. 2B). A close inspection of the interface between ChREBP and 14-3-3β revealed the presence of a free sulfate (SO4) molecule mediating some of the interactions between the two proteins (Fig. 3A). This sulfate molecule interacts directly with Arg-58, Arg-129, and Tyr-130 of 14-3-3β, the so-called Arg-Arg-Tyr triad important for phosphopeptide binding (22.Yang X. Lee W.H. Sobott F. Papagrigoriou E. Robinson C.V. Grossmann J.G. Sundström M. Doyle D.A. Elkins J.M. Structural basis for protein-protein interactions in the 14-3-3 protein family.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17237-17242Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and indirectly with Asn-175 through a water molecule (Fig. 3A); it also interacts directly with Arg-128 of ChREBP. Although it is equally likely that a phosphate molecule can bind to the same site, we assigned a sulfate at this position because of the presence of 2.2 m ammonium sulfate as the crystallization agent. In addition to these sulfate-mediated or potentially phosphate-mediated interactions, there are a number of direct contacts between ChREBP and 14-3-3β, including hydrogen bonds between Asn-124, Trp-127, and Arg-128 of ChREBP to Asn-226, Arg-58, and Glu-182 of 14-3-3β, respectively. A number of prominent van der Waals contacts are also observed between the two proteins. In particular, Arg-62 of 14-3-3β intercalates between two tryptophan side chains of ChREBP (Trp-127 and Trp-130) (Fig. 3A), and the side chain of Glu-182 of 14-3-3β stacks against Tyr-131 of ChREBP. As a result, about 35% of surface area of ChREBP α2 helix is buried upon forming the complex with 14-3-3β (916 Å2 contact area out of a total of 2673 Å2). Importantly, the structural analysis indicates that residue Ser-140, which has been mutated from Ser to Asp in the construct to mimic phosphoserine, is not involved in the interaction with 14-3-3. To validate the observed interface between 14-3-3 and ChREBP, we made a series of site-directed mutations on ChREBP α2 aimed to disrupt its interactions with 14-3-3. These include R121A, N124A, W127A, R128A, and W130A of ChREBP. Full-length FLAG-tagged ChREBP containing these mutations were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified by anti-FLAG affinity gel. Any endogenous 14-3-3 proteins associated with ChREBP are expected to be co-purified. As shown in Fig. 4A, a substantial amount of endogenous 14-3-3 proteins co-purified with wild-type (WT) ChREBP, whereas mutation of any one of these ChREBP residues abolished its binding to endogenous 14-3-3. We also made a series of mutations on 14-3-3β at its interfa"

Expanded lengths of 36–6550 repeats can exhibit a high degree of genetic instability, where the number of repeats strongly influences the probability of further mutation. Ongoing TNR expansions in somatic tissues are thought to contribute to disease progression and severity. The mechanism of repeat expansions is not known; however, DNA replication slippage, transcription, and aberrant mismatch repair (MMR) are involved (for review, see Ref. 2.López Castel A. Cleary J.D.

Because MMR proteins repair short insertion-deletion loops, it is possible that their mutagenic role in TNR instability is the result of attempts to process CTG/CAG repeat structures. On a mechanistic level, slipped-DNAs are thought to be mutagenic intermediates of TNR instability. We have shown previously that long slip-outs containing 20 excess repeats can be correctly repaired, escape repair, or undergo error-prone repair depending upon the slip-out sequence and nick location; however, all of these processes are independent of the MMR proteins hMutSα, hMutSβ, hMLH1, and hPMS2 (9.Panigrahi G.B. Lau R. Montgomery S.E. Leonard M.R. Pearson C.E. Slipped (CTG)·(CAG) repeats can be correctly repaired, escape repair or undergo error-prone repair.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast, isolated short slip-outs of 1–3 repeat units are repaired with very high efficiency, and this repair is hMutSβ-dependent (1.Panigrahi G.B. Slean M.M. Simard J.P. Gileadi O. Pearson C.E. Isolated short CTG/CAG DNA slip-outs are repaired efficiently by hMutSβ, but clustered slip-outs are poorly repaired.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 12593-12598Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the presence of multiple clustered short slip-outs, repair efficiency is greatly decreased, likely due to repair interference of adjacent slip-outs. Failed attempts to repair the multiple lesions can be error-prone, indicating a mechanism by which hMutSβ can lead to repeat expansions. The role of MutL homologs in processing slipped-DNAs is currently unknown. In this study, we investigated whether or not hMLH1, hPMS2, hPMS1, and hMLH3 are involved in the repair of short slip-outs. Whereas MutSβ is clearly implicated in causing instability, a role for the MutL complexes has been less apparent. Following the recognition of unpaired or damaged DNA by either the MutSα (MSH2-MSH6) or MutSβ (MSH2-MSH3) complex, other proteins are recruited to initiate and complete repair. Such factors include the MutL homologs hMutLα (hMLH1-hPMS2), hMutLβ (hMLH1-hPMS1), and hMutLγ (hMLH1-hMLH3), where the latter two complexes play a minor role in mismatch repair relative to hMutLα (10.Li G.M. Mechanisms and functions of DNA mismatch repair.Cell Res. 2008; 18: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast models showed that deficiencies of yMLH1 and yPMS1 (hPMS2 homolog in yeast) had no effect on CAG contractions or CTG expansions (11.Richard G.F. Dujon B. Haber J.E. Double-strand break repair can lead to high frequencies of deletions within short CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats.Mol. Gen.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1501-1507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), similar to the absence of an effect by deficiencies of yMSH2, yMSH3, or yMSH6 (13.Miret J.J. Pessoa-Brandão L. Lahue R.S. Orientation-dependent and sequence-specific expansions of CTG/CAG trinucleotide repeats in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Yet, in a Pms2−/− DM1 mouse model, some rare large repeat contractions were observed, and the rate of expansions was decreased by 50% (15.Gomes-Pereira M. Fortune M.T. Ingram L. McAbney J.P. Monckton D.G. Pms2 is a genetic enhancer of trinucleotide CAG·CTG repeat somatic mosaicism: implications for the mechanism of triplet repeat expansion.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1815-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This partial effect was attributed to the presence of MLH3 which has some MMR activity (16.Cannavo E. Marra G. Sabates-Bellver J. Menigatti M. Lipkin S.M. Fischer F. Cejka P. Jiricny J. Expression of the MutL homologue hMLH3 in human cells and its role in DNA mismatch repair.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10759-10766Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In human cells, an hMLH1 deficiency had no effect on replication-induced repeat contractions (17.Pelletier R. Farrell B.T. Miret J.J. Lahue R.S. Mechanistic features of CAG·CTG repeat contractions in cultured cells revealed by a novel genetic assay.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5667-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, knockdowns of MLH1 or hPMS2 increased transcription-induced CAG contractions (18.Lin Y. Wilson J.H. Diverse effects of individual mismatch repair components on transcription-induced CAG repeat instability in human cells.DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A clear role for MutLα, MutLβ, or MutLγ in the processing of slipped-DNAs is lacking. In this study, we investigated whether or not hMLH1, hPMS2, hPMS1, or hMLH3 are involved in the repair of single repeat slip-outs. We found that hMutLα, but not hMutLβ or hMutLγ, is required for the repair of short slip-outs and plays a partial role in the limited repair of clustered short slip-outs, similar to hMutSβ. Circular substrates containing a one repeat slip-out were made by hybridizing single-stranded circular DNA with a pure (CAG)47 repeat tract with a double-stranded linearized plasmid containing (CTG)48·(CAG)48 repeats. The site of linearization (EcoRI or HindIII) placed a nick in the CTG strand either 5′ or 3′ to the slip-out. Slipped-DNA (S-DNA) substrates contain an equal number of CTG and CAG repeats (50 repeats). Detailed procedures for making the substrates have been previously described (9.Panigrahi G.B. Lau R. Montgomery S.E. Leonard M.R. Pearson C.E. Slipped (CTG)·(CAG) repeats can be correctly repaired, escape repair or undergo error-prone repair.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The HEK293T (293T) cell line was a gift from Dr. G. Plotz. HeLa cells were from the National Cell Culture Center, National Center for Resources, National Institutes of Health. HEC-1-A was from the American Type Culture Collection. Cell extracts were prepared as described (9.Panigrahi G.B. Lau R. Montgomery S.E. Leonard M.R. Pearson C.E. Slipped (CTG)·(CAG) repeats can be correctly repaired, escape repair or undergo error-prone repair.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) from repair-proficient and -deficient cell lines. The expression vectors for the wild-type hMLH1 (pcDNA3.1-hMLH1) and hPMS2 (pSG5-hPMS2) were gifts from Drs. G. Plotz and J. Trojan (19.Trojan J. Zeuzem S. Randolph A. Hemmerle C. Brieger A. Raedle J. Plotz G. Jiricny J. Marra G. Functional analysis of hMLH1 variants and HNPCC-related mutations using a human expression system.Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 211-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The pSVwt plasmid for expressing SV-40 T-antigen was a gift from Dr. E. Fanning. The hMLH1 variants (T117M and I219V) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type vectors using the Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (catalog 200518; Stratagene). The 293T cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics. The cells were transfected with plasmids containing hMLH1 wild-type, hMLH1 variants, and hPMS2 genes using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Similarly, HEC-1-A cells lacking hPMS2 were transfected with SV40 T-antigen plasmid (pSVwt) and hPMS2 expression plasmid, pSG5-hPMS2. The extracts from transfected cells were made as described above. Western blots of 293T and HEC-1-A cell extracts were probed with antibodies against hMLH1 (catalog 554073; BD Biosciences), hPMS2 (catalog 556415; BD Biosciences), and actin (catalog 612657; BD Biosciences). Repair reactions were carried out as described previously (9.Panigrahi G.B. Lau R. Montgomery S.E. Leonard M.R. Pearson C.E. Slipped (CTG)·(CAG) repeats can be correctly repaired, escape repair or undergo error-prone repair.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, 22 fmol of circular slipped-substrates was incubated with whole cell extracts, NTPs, dNTPs, creatine kinase, and creatine phosphate for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped in 2 mg/ml proteinase K, 2% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 1 h, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation to clean up the reaction. The resulting material was digested with EcoRI/HindIII and run on a 4% polyacrylamide gel for Southern blot analysis. The southern probe used was an EcoRI/HindIII repeat-containing fragment from a related plasmid with (CTG)17·(CAG)17. Repair efficiency is the proportion of radiointensity of the repair product relative to all repeat-containing fragments (ImageQuant Molecular Dynamics v1.2). To determine the role of hMLH1 and hPMS2 in the processing of slipped-DNAs formed by TNRs, we used the HEK293T cell line (293T) which is deficient in hMLH1 due to CpG methylation of the hMLH1 gene promoter and deficient in hPMS2 due to its destabilization in the absence of hMLH1 (16.Cannavo E. Marra G. Sabates-Bellver J. Menigatti M. Lipkin S.M. Fischer F. Cejka P. Jiricny J.

Extracts of 293T cells are deficient in the repair of G-T mismatches, but when co-transfected with wild-type hMLH1 and hPMS2 expression constructs, the extracts are MMR-functional (16.Cannavo E. Marra G. Sabates-Bellver J. Menigatti M. Lipkin S.M. Fischer F. Cejka P. Jiricny J.

To determine whether the hMutLα complex is required in the repair of short TNR slip-outs, we assessed the repair of a single CTG repeat slip-out in a circular substrate containing a nick located 5′ of the slip-out. This single-repeat slip-out was processed with MMR-proficient HeLa extracts, hMutLα-deficient 293T extracts, and 293T+hMLH1+hPMS2 extracts. The repair efficiency of 293T was only 18% compared with 73% in HeLa (Fig. 2A, compare efficiencies after background correction). This suggested that the inability of the 293T extracts to repair the slip-out was due to the absence of the hMutLα complex. The repair efficiency of 293T cells was fully restored to 73% by transfecting with wild-type hMLH1 and hPMS2 genes, indicating a requirement of hMutLα for the highly efficient repair of single repeat slip-outs with a 5′-nick. It is notable that the very high levels of repair of the single repeat slip-out produced by the MMR-proficient HeLa and the hMutLα-corrected 293T extracts exceeded that of a G-T mismatch (one of the best repaired base-base mismatches), which is repaired at 35–40% (1.Panigrahi G.B. Slean M.M. Simard J.P. Gileadi O. Pearson C.E. Isolated short CTG/CAG DNA slip-outs are repaired efficiently by hMutSβ, but clustered slip-outs are poorly repaired.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Strand-specific mismatch correction in nuclear extracts of human and Drosophila melanogaster cell lines.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Thus, the highly efficient repair of single repeat slip-outs requires hMutLα. Because the requirement of hMutLα was shown to be different for G-T mismatches with 5′- versus 3′-nicks (21.Kadyrov F.A. Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Modrich P. Endonucleolytic function of MutLα in human mismatch repair.Cell. 2006; 126: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), we assessed the requirement of hMutLα in the processing of single repeat slip-outs with nicks located 3′ of the slip-out. The repair efficiency of 293T cell extracts was only approximately 12% above background (see hatched area in Fig. 2B). Repair activity was restored up to 34% over background when complemented with wild-type hMLH1 and hPMS2. Overall, the 3′-nicked substrates were repaired less efficiently than the 5′-nicked substrates, as shown previously (1.Panigrahi G.B. Slean M.M. Simard J.P. Gileadi O. Pearson C.E. Isolated short CTG/CAG DNA slip-outs are repaired efficiently by hMutSβ, but clustered slip-outs are poorly repaired.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The ATP-binding and ATPase activity of hMLH1 have been shown to be important for MMR activity (22.Räschle M. Marra G. Nyström-Lahti M. Schär P. Jiricny J.

Transfection of the 293T cells with the T117M hMLH1 and the wild-type hPMS2 recovered expression of both proteins (Fig. 1). We tested the repair activity of extracts of 293T cells transfected with the T117M hMLH1 variant and found that this variant could not complement repair (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with the inability of this mutant hMLH1 to restore repair of a G-T mismatch (19.Trojan J. Zeuzem S. Randolph A. Hemmerle C. Brieger A. Raedle J. Plotz G. Jiricny J.

Similar experiments were performed using substrates with nicks located 3′ of the single repeat CTG slip-out (Fig. 2B). Extracts of 293T cells transfected with the ATP binding-defective T117M hMLH1 did not show restored repair activity. This indicates a requirement of hMLH1 ATP-binding activity for the high levels of single repeat slip-out repair. Because there have been numerous suggestions in the literature that polymorphic variants of DNA repair proteins may have functional differences in their repair activities, we assessed repair using a rare functional polymorphic variant of hMLH1. The I219V hMLH1 protein has an allele frequency ranging from 3 to 36% depending upon the studied population (19.Trojan J. Zeuzem S. Randolph A. Hemmerle C. Brieger A. Raedle J. Plotz G. Jiricny J.

https://openalex.org/W2050255095,"Human hyaluronidase-4 (hHYAL4), a member of the hyaluronidase family, has no hyaluronidase activity, but is a chondroitin sulfate (CS)-specific endo-β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. The expression of hHYAL4 is not ubiquitous but restricted to placenta, skeletal muscle, and testis, suggesting that hHYAL4 is not involved in the systemic catabolism of CS, but rather has specific functions in particular organs or tissues. To elucidate the function of hyaluronidase-4 in vivo, mouse hyaluronidase-4 (mHyal4) was characterized. mHyal4 was also demonstrated to be a CS-specific endo-β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. However, mHyal4 and hHYAL4 differed in the sulfate groups they recognized. Although hHYAL4 strongly preferred GlcUA(2-O-sulfate)-GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)-containing sequences typical in CS-D, where GlcUA represents d-glucuronic acid, mHyal4 depolymerized various CS isoforms to a similar extent, suggesting broad substrate specificity. To identify the amino acid residues responsible for this difference, a series of human/mouse HYAL4 chimeric proteins and HYAL4 point mutants were generated, and their preference for substrates was investigated. A combination of the amino acid residues at 261-265 and glutamine at 305 was demonstrated to be essential for the enzymatic activity as well as substrate specificity of mHyal4."

We demonstrated that BDNF-induced TrkB dimerization led to LIMK1 dimerization and transphosphorylation independent of TrkB kinase activity, which could further enhance the activation and stabilization of LIMK1.

Although human papillomavirus can be detected in nearly all cases, the mechanism of cervical carcinogenesis remains to be further addressed. Here, we demonstrated that ZNF268, a Krüppel-associated box-containing zinc finger protein, might contribute to the development of cervical cancer. We found that ZNF268b2, an isoform of ZNF268, was overexpressed in human squamous cervical cancer specimens. Knockdown of ZNF268 in cervical cancer cells caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, reduced colony formation, and increased sensitivity to TNFα-induced apoptosis. In addition, HeLa cell growth in xenograft nude mice was suppressed by ZNF268 knockdown, with increased apoptosis. Furthermore, ZNF268b2 was shown to increase NF-κB signaling in vitro and in vivo. Reconstitution of NF-κB activity restored proliferation in ZNF268 knockdown HeLa cells. Of note, we observed a high frequency of NF-κB activation in ZNF268-overexpressing cervical cancer tissues, suggesting a pathological coincidence of ZNF268b2 overexpression and NF-κB activation. Taken together, our results reveal a novel role of ZNF268b2 that contributes to cervical carcinogenesis in part through enhancing NF-κB signaling.

Knockdown of ZNF268 in cervical cancer cells caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, reduced colony formation, and increased sensitivity to TNFα-induced apoptosis. In addition, HeLa cell growth in xenograft nude mice was suppressed by ZNF268 knockdown, with increased apoptosis. Furthermore, ZNF268b2 was shown to increase NF-κB signaling in vitro and in vivo. Reconstitution of NF-κB activity restored proliferation in ZNF268 knockdown HeLa cells. Of note, we observed a high frequency of NF-κB activation in ZNF268-overexpressing cervical cancer tissues, suggesting a pathological coincidence of ZNF268b2 overexpression and NF-κB activation. Taken together, our results reveal a novel role of ZNF268b2 that contributes to cervical carcinogenesis in part through enhancing NF-κB signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2058491732,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is an evolutionarily conserved multi-protein complex that interfaces with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and plays critical developmental roles in both animals and plants. Although some subunits are present only in an ∼320-kDa complex-dependent form, other subunits are also detected in configurations distinct from the 8-subunit holocomplex. To date, the only known biochemical activity intrinsic to the complex, deneddylation of the Cullin subunits from Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, is assigned to CSN5. As an essential step to understanding the structure and assembly of a CSN5-containing subcomplex of the CSN, we reconstituted a CSN4-5-6-7 subcomplex. The core of the subcomplex is based on a stable heterotrimeric association of CSN7, CSN4, and CSN6, requiring coexpression in a bacterial reconstitution system. To this heterotrimer, we could then add CSN5 in vitro to reconstitute a quaternary complex. Using biochemical and biophysical methods, we identified pairwise and combinatorial interactions necessary for the formation of the CSN4-5-6-7 subcomplex. The subcomplex is stabilized by three types of interactions: MPN-MPN between CSN5 and CSN6, PCI-PCI between CSN4 and CSN7, and interactions mediated through the CSN6 C terminus with CSN4 and CSN7. CSN8 was also found to interact with the CSN4-6-7 core. These data provide a strong framework for further investigation of the organization and assembly of this pivotal regulatory complex."

Two adjacent hydrophobic amino acids (Ile-2588 and Ile-2589) at the putative cytosolic interface of the S6 helix inactivated channel function and could be candidates for the channel gate. Of five negatively charged residues mutated, none completely eliminated channel function. Of five positively charged residues mutated, only one inactivated the channel (Arg-2596). In addition to the previously identified role of a pair of cysteines in the C-tail (Cys-2610 and Cys-2613), a pair of highly conserved histidines (His-2630 and His-2635) were also essential for channel function. Expression of the H2630A and H2635A mutants (but not R2596A) produced receptors with destabilized interactions between the N-terminal fragment and the channel domain.

Lipid peroxidation, a secondary process that occurs during instances of free radical production, may play an important role in modulating cellular signaling under conditions of oxidative stress. 4-Hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) is an electrophilic aldehyde produced during lipid peroxidation that forms covalent adducts on proteins, altering their activity and function. One such target, LKB1, has been reported to be inhibited by HNE adduction. We tested the hypothesis that HNE inhibits LKB1 activity through adduct formation on a specific reactive residue of the protein. To elucidate the mechanism of the inhibitory effect, HEK293T cells expressing LKB1 were treated with HNE (10 μm for 1 h) and assayed for HNE-LKB1 adduct formation and changes in LKB1 kinase activity. HNE treatment resulted in the formation of HNE-LKB1 adducts and decreased LKB1 kinase activity by 31 ± 9% (S.E.) but had no effect on the association of LKB1 with its adaptor proteins sterile-20-related adaptor and mouse protein 25. Mutation of LKB1 lysine residue 97 reduced HNE adduct formation and attenuated the effect of HNE on LKB1 activity.

Under basal conditions, LKB1 is localized to the nucleus where it has limited catalytic activity.

The role of lysine acetylation and deacetylation has been studied extensively in regard to histone regulation and transcriptional effects, but emerging data suggest that non-histone lysine modifications also play a vital role in cellular energetic homeostasis. Lysine acetylation of non-histone proteins can regulate cellular metabolism (23.Zhao S. Xu W. Jiang W. Yu W. Lin Y. Zhang T. Yao J. Zhou L. Zeng Y. Li H. Li Y. Shi J. An W. Hancock S.M. He F. Qin L.

In the cardiovascular system, deacetylation of lysine residues on key metabolic proteins can modulate mitochondrial function through changes in apoptotic signaling, respiratory capacity, and ATP synthesis (25.Lu Z.

Res. 2009; 105: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we observed that LKB1 acetylation occurs at several lysine residues that function to regulate LKB1 localization (7.Lan F. Cacicedo J.M. Ruderman N. Ido Y. SIRT1 modulation of the acetylation status, cytosolic localization, and activity of LKB1. Possible role in AMP-activated protein kinase activation.J. Biol.

We now test the hypothesis that inhibitory HNE adducts of LKB1 occur at lysine residues capable of being acetylated, thereby regulating enzyme activity. We show that HNE adducts to LKB1 at Lys-96 and Lys-97 and that adduction to Lys-97, but not Lys-96, inhibits LKB1 kinase activity. HNE was obtained from Calbiochem, and [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Localization studies were conducted using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit from Thermo Scientific (catalogue number 78833) according to the specifications of the manufacturer. Purity of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions was assessed by protein expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and histone H3, respectively, and fractions with a minimum of 85% purity were used for data analysis. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin. The antibody recognizing transfected glutathione S-transferase (GST) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The goat polyclonal antibody recognizing HNE and the mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing GAPDH were both from Abcam. FLAG (M2) was from Sigma. The STRAD antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (S-17). Secondary antibodies coupled to IR 680 or 800 dye were from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). The generation of the expression constructs for GST-LKB1, His-STRAD, and FLAG-MO25 and the creation of LKB1 lysine mutations are described in full detail in our previous work (7.Lan F. Cacicedo J.M. Ruderman N. Ido Y. SIRT1 modulation of the acetylation status, cytosolic localization, and activity of LKB1. Possible role in AMP-activated protein kinase activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27628-27635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of LKB1, STRAD, and MO25 plasmids in each well of a 6-well plate using the Max-PEI polymer (Polysciences, Inc.). 18 h post-transfection, the cells were used for experimentation. Cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed with 1× lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. To purify GST-tagged protein, the lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample loading buffer (Bio-Rad) prior to Western blotting. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The probed membranes were visualized using the LI-COR Odyssey IR imager and analyzed by densitometry using Odyssey 2.1 software. Immunoprecipitated GST-LKB1 was washed twice with lysis buffer and once with 1× kinase assay buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). The purified proteins were incubated with 1× kinase assay buffer containing the LKBtide synthetic substrate (300 μm; Millipore), ATP (200 μm), and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi). After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction mixture was spotted on P81 phosphate paper and washed, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Statistics were performed with a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance where appropriate. All data shown represent the results obtained from independent experiments conducted in triplicate (or more as noted in the figure legends), and data are expressed as means ± S.E. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. It was reported previously that HNE concentrations of 40 μm form inhibitory adducts on LKB1 in neonatal cardiomyocytes (21.Dolinsky V.W. Chan A.Y. Robillard Frayne I. Light P.E. Des Rosiers C. Dyck J.R. Resveratrol prevents the prohypertrophic effects of oxidative stress on LKB1.Circulation. 2009; 119: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We expressed LKB1 and its binding partners STRAD and MO25 in HEK293T cells and exposed the cells to HNE at concentrations of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 μm for 1 h. In cells expressing the LKB1 complex, HNE adducts were readily detectable in immunoprecipitated LKB1 with HNE concentrations of 10 μm and higher (Fig. 1A), and accordingly an HNE concentration of 10 μm was used in the remainder of this study. To further confirm the presence of HNE-LKB1 adducts, HNE-bound proteins were immunoprecipitated, and LKB1 was detected among the HNE-modified proteins (Fig. 1B). Coincident with the formation of HNE-LKB1 adducts, exposure to HNE (10 μm for 1 h) caused a 31 ± 9% (S.E.) decrease in LKB1 activity as assessed with a kinase assay using the LKBtide synthetic substrate (Fig. 1C). Because LKB1 kinase activity is greatly enhanced when LKB1 interacts with STRAD and MO25, we tested whether HNE interferes with LKB1 complex formation and thereby diminishes its activity. Immunoprecipitation of LKB1 and subsequent immunoblotting for STRAD and MO25 demonstrated no effect of HNE on LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex formation (Fig. 1D). The cellular localization of LKB1 is also known to affect its catalytic activity (6.Boudeau J. Baas A.F. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Kieloch A. Schutkowski M. Prescott A.R. Clevers H.C. Alessi D.R. MO25α/β interact with STRADα/β enhancing their ability to bind, activate and localize LKB1 in the cytoplasm.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5102-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To determine whether HNE could affect LKB1 localization, protein lysates from cells expressing the LKB1 complex were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. HNE treatment had no effect on the localization of LKB1, STRAD, or MO25 (Fig. 1E), and LKB1 was observed to localize primarily in the cytoplasm both with and without HNE (Fig. 1F). Together these data suggest that the inhibitory effect of HNE is due to a direct effect on LKB1 enzymatic function and is not related to changes in complex formation or localization. Our previous work demonstrated that several lysine residues of LKB1 can be acetylated both in vitro and in vivo (7.Lan F. Cacicedo J.M. Ruderman N. Ido Y. SIRT1 modulation of the acetylation status, cytosolic localization, and activity of LKB1. Possible role in AMP-activated protein kinase activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27628-27635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Because lysine residues may possess important regulatory functions, we investigated whether they are targeted for HNE adduction. We used three LKB1 mutants in which lysine residues were mutated to arginine, a mutation that mimics the effects of deacetylation (26.Megee P.C. Morgan B.A. Mittman B.A. Smith M.M. Genetic analysis of histone H4: essential role of lysines subject to reversible acetylation.Science. 1990; 247: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and reduces the chemical affinity of HNE for the mutated residue. The mutants were expressed in HEK293T cells and screened for the ability of HNE to form covalent adducts. Mutation of lysines 96 (K96R) and 97 (K97R) each reduced HNE adduct formation (Fig. 2, A–D). Interestingly, mutation of Lys-96 and Lys-97 together (K96R/K97R) caused a greater decrease in HNE adduct formation than mutation of either Lys-96 or Lys-97 alone (Fig. 2, E and F). Immunoprecipitation of HNE-bound proteins confirmed that there was a decreased amount of HNE-LKB1 adducts in the K96R/K97R mutant (Fig. 2, G and H). The finding that HNE adduct formation is decreased by mutation of LKB1 lysine 96 or 97 raised the possibility that these mutants would be resistant to the inhibitory effect of HNE. However, the kinase activity of the K96R mutant was inhibited by HNE to the same extent as wild type LKB1 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, kinase activity of the K97R mutant was resistant to inhibition (Fig. 3B) as was the K96R/K97R LKB1 mutant (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the K97R and K96R/K97R mutants, but not the K96R mutant, exhibited an ∼2-fold increase in basal kinase activity as compared with wild type LKB1. The goal of this study was to determine the mechanism by which HNE inhibits LKB1 kinase activity. Our major findings are that (a) HNE inhibition of LKB1 kinase activity does not involve disruption of LKB1 translocation or complex formation, (b) HNE forms adducts with LKB1 at Lys-96 and Lys-97, and (c) targeted mutation of Lys-97, but not Lys-96, prevents the inhibitory action of HNE. The ability of HNE to form adducts with LKB1 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitating LKB1 and immunoblotting for HNE adducts and was confirmed by pulling down HNE-modified proteins and probing for associated LKB1. The formation of HNE-LKB1 adducts was first observed in MCF-7 cells (20.Wagner T.M. Mullally J.E. Fitzpatrick F.A. Reactive lipid species from cyclooxygenase-2 inactivate tumor suppressor LKB1/STK11: cyclopentenone prostaglandins and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal covalently modify and inhibit the AMP-kinase kinase that modulates cellular energy homeostasis and protein translation.J.

It was noted that Cys-210 is an evolutionarily conserved cysteine residue among a number of serine/threonine kinases and is a target for lipid adduction. Although Cys-210 appears capable of mediating lipid adduct formation as demonstrated by loss of the ability of reactive lipids to form adducts against LKB1 in which Cys-210 is mutated to serine, the effects of HNE adduction on LKB1 activity and/or downstream signaling were not determined. More recently, it was shown that HNE can adduct to LKB1 and is associated with inhibition of enzyme activity and increased hypertrophic signaling stemming from changes in the LKB1-AMPK signaling axis (21.Dolinsky V.W. Chan A.Y. Robillard Frayne I. Light P.E. Des Rosiers C. Dyck J.R. Resveratrol prevents the prohypertrophic effects of oxidative stress on LKB1.Circulation. 2009; 119: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We next confirmed that HNE inhibits LKB1 enzymatic activity. We measured LKB1 kinase activity directly using the synthetic substrate LKBtide, a well validated approach that we (7.Lan F. Cacicedo J.M. Ruderman N. Ido Y. SIRT1 modulation of the acetylation status, cytosolic localization, and activity of LKB1. Possible role in AMP-activated protein kinase activation.J. Biol.

Metab. 2005; 289: E710-E715Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have used. Phosphorylation at Ser-428 may also be used to measure LKB1 activity as it is correlated with increased activity and is thought to be required for LKB1-dependent functions in some cell types (29.Xie Z. Dong Y. Scholz R. Neumann D. Zou M.H. Phosphorylation of LKB1 at serine 428 by protein kinase C-ζ is required for metformin-enhanced activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase in endothelial cells.Circulation. 2008; 117: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation at Ser-428 is not necessary for all kinase-dependent functions of the protein (30.Fogarty S. Hardie D.G. C-terminal phosphorylation of LKB1 is not required for regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase, BRSK1, BRSK2, or cell cycle arrest.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 77-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a novel alternative LKB1 splice variant that lacks a portion of the C-terminal domain containing Ser-428 but possesses catalytic activity on par with the full-length LKB1 gene product has been identified (31.Denison F.C. Hiscock N.J. Carling D. Woods A. Characterization of an alternative splice variant of LKB1.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism by which HNE inhibits LKB1 activity, we first examined whether HNE interfered with LKB1 translocation or complex formation. HNE had no effect on the translocation of LKB1 as assessed by the distribution of protein between the nucleus and cytosol. Likewise, HNE inhibited LKB1 activity without disruption of complex formation as measured by the association of LKB1 with its binding partners STRAD and MO25. We next used site-directed mutants of LKB1 in which lysine is mutated to arginine to test the role of specific lysine residues in mediating the effects of HNE. Because arginine cannot be acetylated, this mutation mimics the effect of deacetylation and also decreases the chemical affinity of the residue for HNE. Mutation of Lys-96 or Lys-97 decreased the formation of HNE adducts to a similar degree, and mutation of Lys-96 and Lys-97 together caused a roughly additive decrease in HNE adduction, indicating that both Lys-96 and Lys-97 are sites of HNE adduction. In contrast to the similar effects the K96R and K97R mutants have on HNE adduct formation, only the K97R mutant was protected from inhibition by HNE. Enzyme activity was also protected in the K96R/K97R mutant. Thus, although HNE can adduct to both Lys-96 and Lys-97, adduct formation at Lys-97 alone is sufficient to mediate enzyme inhibition. These findings suggest that HNE inhibits LKB1 activity via a direct post-translational modification at Lys-97. Aside from modification by HNE, no other direct oxidative post-translational modifications of LKB1 have been described. The reactive nitrogen species peroxynitrite (ONOO−) has been shown to regulate LKB1 activity indirectly through activity of upstream protein kinase C ζ in the endothelium (32.Xie Z. Dong Y. Zhang M. Cui M.Z. Cohen R.A. Riek U. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Zou M.H. Activation of protein kinase C ζ by peroxynitrite regulates LKB1-dependent AMP-activated protein kinase in cultured endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6366-6375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we cannot exclude other sites at which HNE adduction occurs on the LKB1 protein. It is conceivable that amino acid residues aside from Lys-96 and Lys-97 are targets of HNE. Further studies in our laboratory suggest that the GST tag of the protein is not a target, but amino acids in other domains of the protein may be targeted by HNE (data not shown). It is noteworthy that basal enzyme activity was increased ∼2-fold in both the K97R and K96R/K97R mutants. Lys-97 is a known target of acetylation (7.Lan F. Cacicedo J.M. Ruderman N. Ido Y. SIRT1 modulation of the acetylation status, cytosolic localization, and activity of LKB1. Possible role in AMP-activated protein kinase activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27628-27635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Modification of this residue by acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation, or ubiquitination could potentially modulate the kinase function of LKB1. More studies will need to be carried out to delineate the precise mechanism by which mutation of Lys-97 increases LKB1 kinase activity. The structure of HNE contains three functional groups (CC double bond, CO carbonyl group, and the hydroxyl group) that are responsible for the high reactivity of this electrophilic aldehyde (15.Schaur R.J. Basic aspects of the biochemical reactivity of 4-hydroxynonenal.Mol. Aspects Med. 2003; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although carbon 3 is the primary site of nucleophilic attack by thiol or amine groups via the Michael reaction, the carbonyl carbon 1 is a secondary target of primary amines through Schiff base formation. Using synthetic polyamino acid model compounds, HNE was shown to chemically react in the following order: Cys > His > Lys (33.Poli G. Schaur R.J. Siems W.G. Leonarduzzi G. 4-Hydroxynonenal: a membrane lipid oxidation product of medicinal interest.Med. Res. Rev. 2008; 28: 569-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). It was noted that this order does not implicate cysteine residues as the preferred targets of HNE. Depending on the overall quaternary protein structure as well as the surrounding amino acid residues, the reactivity of HNE toward amine-containing amino acids can be enhanced. A noteworthy aspect of this study is the use of a low concentration of HNE (10 μm). The concentration of HNE in human plasma ranges from 0.3 to 0.7 μm (34.Strohmaier H. Hinghofer-Szalkay H. Schaur R.J. Detection of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) as a physiological component in human plasma.J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 11: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) but can reach levels as high as 10 μm under conditions of oxidative stress (35.Uchida K. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal: a product and mediator of oxidative stress.Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 318-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Studies investigating HNE-mediated changes in LKB1 signaling used an HNE concentration of 40 μm (21.Dolinsky V.W. Chan A.Y. Robillard Frayne I. Light P.E. Des Rosiers C. Dyck J.R. Resveratrol prevents the prohypertrophic effects of oxidative stress on LKB1.Circulation. 2009; 119: 1643-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which resulted in significant degradation of the LKB1 protein within 1 h. Pathophysiological responses to HNE treatment in cardiac myocytes with concentrations as high as 400 μm have been reported to include calcium overload and reactive oxygen species generation (36.Nakamura K. Miura D. Kusano K.F. Fujimoto Y. Sumita-Yoshikawa W. Fuke S. Nishii N. Nagase S. Hata Y. Morita H. Matsubara H. Ohe T.

By using a relatively low concentration of HNE, our findings are less likely to be confounded by cellular events that may be activated with higher concentrations. In summary, this study provides compelling evidence that post-translational modification of LKB1 via HNE adduct formation at Lys-97 is responsible for the inhibitory effect of this lipid peroxidation by-product on kinase activity. Inhibition of LKB1 during states of increased oxidative stress and secondary lipid peroxidation could lead to energetic impairment and cellular dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W2070587519,"Adsorption of fibrinogen on fibrin clots and other surfaces strongly reduces integrin-mediated adhesion of platelets and leukocytes with implications for the surface-mediated control of thrombus growth and blood compatibility of biomaterials. The underlying mechanism of this process is surface-induced aggregation of fibrinogen, resulting in the assembly of a nanoscale multilayered matrix. The matrix is extensible, which makes it incapable of transducing strong mechanical forces via cellular integrins, resulting in insufficient intracellular signaling and weak cell adhesion. To determine the mechanism of the multilayer formation, the physical and adhesive properties of fibrinogen matrices prepared from human plasma fibrinogen (hFg), recombinant normal (rFg), and fibrinogen with the truncated αC regions (FgAα251) were compared. Using atomic force microscopy and force spectroscopy, we show that whereas hFg and rFg generated the matrices with a thickness of ∼8 nm consisting of 7-8 molecular layers, the deposition of FgAα251 was terminated at two layers, indicating that the αC regions are essential for the multilayer formation. The extensibility of the matrix prepared from FgAα251 was 2-fold lower than that formed from hFg and rFg. In agreement with previous findings that cell adhesion inversely correlates with the extensibility of the fibrinogen matrix, the less extensible FgAα251 matrix and matrices generated from human fibrinogen variants lacking the αC regions supported sustained adhesion of leukocytes and platelets. The persistent adhesiveness of matrices formed from fibrinogen derivatives without the αC regions may have implications for conditions in which elevated levels of these molecules are found, including vascular pathologies, diabetes, thrombolytic therapy, and dysfibrinogenemia."

Activated β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and complexes with T-cell factor (TCF) transcription factor, which is a vital step in carcinogenesis because it globally alters the expression of oncogenic target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-myc (14.Barker N.

Therefore, deciphering the molecular interplay between PPAR-δ and β-catenin is important to clarify the nature of the pathway network for cancer formation and progression. More specifically, detailed transcriptional functions of β-catenin in conjunction with PPAR-δ activation could provide clues for the complex interaction between these transcriptional regulators in VEGFA transcription. Transcription is mediated by the binding of specific transcription factors to regulatory sequences. Long range interactions between promoter and regulatory elements are important for high level expression of target genes and may cause looping of chromatin as well as protein-protein interactions (30.Li Q. Barkess G. Qian H. Chromatin looping and the probability of transcription.Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 197-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31.Kleinjan D.A. van Heyningen V. Long range control of gene expression. Emerging mechanisms and disruption in disease.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 76: 8-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Chromatin looping brings distant cis-acting elements into close proximity, allowing dynamic and flexible interactions between genomic loci as well as between regulatory elements near the gene. Therefore, chromatin looping could modulate the gene expression program in cells, which could operate depending on the cell condition or tissue microenvironment. Global screening of β-catenin target genes has revealed many β-catenin/TCF binding sites at upstream and downstream sites in some target genes (32.Yochum G.S. McWeeney S. Rajaraman V. Cleland R.

Jeong S. β-Catenin binds to the downstream region and regulates the expression C-reactive protein gene.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5511-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In fact, the many faces of β-catenin suggest its role in the regulation of chromatin modification as well as looping (37.Mosimann C. Hausmann G. Basler K. β-Catenin hits chromatin. Regulation of Wnt target gene activation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 38.Valenta T. Hausmann G. Basler K. The many faces and functions of β-catenin.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 2714-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). To solve the complicated mechanism behind β-catenin and PPAR-δ-mediated VEGFA transcription, here we hypothesized that β-catenin forms chromatin looping near the VEGFA genomic locus, and PPAR-δ regulates it to promote VEGFA transcription. As a first step, we identified repressive chromatin looping via β-catenin bindings in the far upstream region and downstream regions of the VEGFA gene. More significantly, such chromatin looping was opened and triggered for activation by treatment with a PPAR-δ agonist. These findings suggest that β-catenin and PPAR-δ modulate VEGFA transcription. Most importantly, these data provide evidence for a novel paradigm of β-catenin-mediated chromatin looping, which could explain the diverse roles of β-catenin on its various target genes. The VEGFA promoter with wild-type and mutant TBE3 (denoted as −1.8 and −0.8 kb VEGFA reporter) were kind gifts from Dr. Daniel C. Chung (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA (4.Zhang X. Gaspard J.P. Chung D.C. Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by the Wnt and K-ras pathways in colonic neoplasia.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6050-6054PubMed Google Scholar)). The longer VEGFA promoter fragment (denoted as −2.3-kb VEGFA reporters) was amplified by genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from HCT116 cells with primers and cloned into the pGL3 control vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by mutagenic PCR to generate the mutant TBE1 reporter (TACAAAG → TAGGGAG). The downstream region of the VEGFA gene (fragment #12) was amplified by PCR primers and cloned into the downstream region of the luciferase gene driven by the −2.3-kb VEGFA promoter (denoted as 2.3-kb+DS). The mammalian expression clone for PPAR-δ was cloned into the pCMV-3xFLAG vector. All primers used for this experiment are listed in supplemental Table 1. HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in denoted as 2.3 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× antimycotic (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with expression clone and reporter constructs using Lipofectamine Plus according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). PPAR-δ activation was achieved by GW501516 (10 μm) treatment after an 8-h serum starvation of HCT116 cells. Cells were transiently cotransfected with the firefly luciferase reporter (100 ng) and the Renilla luciferase reporter (10 ng) to normalize transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was determined with a dual luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Activity was determined using a Glomax 20/20 luminolmeter (Promega). Relative firefly luciferase activity was obtained by normalizing it to that of Renilla luciferase activity. Experiments were repeated at least three times, and values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Cells were harvested with TRIzol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), and total mRNAs were isolated from cells. Total mRNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) (Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) using RevertAid H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas). The resulting cDNA was used in a Step ONE real-time PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative PCR was performed with Dynamo Flash master mix (Finnzyme, Maahantuonti, Finland). Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, and glycine was added to stop the cross-linking reaction. Cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation assay buffer. Resuspended cells were sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) were blocked by tRNA. Immunoprecipitation was carried out for 12–24 h with each antibody. Normal IgG antibody was used as the control sample. After immunoprecipitation, precleared protein G-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 2 h. The beads were collected and washed 3 times with Tris-EDTA buffer and then extracted with elution buffer consisting of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate. The eluents were heated to 65 °C for 6 h to reverse formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA fragments were amplified with specific primers and visualized in agarose gel electrophoresis for ChIP analysis. Concomitantly, real-time qPCR was performed as described above for ChIP-qPCR analysis. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting: anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-TCF-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-α-tubulin (Abcam), and anti-Lamin B1 (Abcam). The 3C protocol has been described previously (39.Dekker J. The three C's of chromosome conformation capture. Controls, controls, controls.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, and quenched with 125 mm glycine. The cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and prelysed with prelysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Penetrated cells were washed with 1× restriction buffer, and SDS was added to each sample to a concentration of 0.1%. Each sample was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and 900 rpm. The action of SDS was stopped by adding 1% Triton X-100; the resulting suspension was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and 900 rpm. Next, the samples were reacted with 500 units of BamHI restriction enzyme (R0136T; New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) overnight. The reaction was terminated by adding 2% SDS. Each sample was diluted in a reaction solution containing T4 DNA ligase (M0202L; New England BioLabs) overnight. Ligated DNA was gathered using standard phenol precipitation and ethanol precipitation methods. Prepared DNA was PCR amplified. Primers used for RT-PCR, ChIP-PCR, and 3C are listed in supplemental Table 1. We first analyzed the upstream region of VEGFA gene for putative β-catenin/TCF and PPAR-δ binding elements. Three TBE consensus sites (forward orientation, (T/A)(T/A)CAA(T/A)G; reverse orientation, C(T/A)TTG(T/A)(T/A)) were predicted (TBE1, −1863; TBE2, −1497; TBE3, −805 shown as solid boxes with numbers in Fig. 1A). To identify TBE sites that could be directly regulated by β-catenin, we analyzed these TBE sites by ChIP assay with anti-β-catenin and anti-TCF-4 antibodies in HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell line. Concomitant and strong β-catenin and TCF-4 bindings were observed at TBE1 and TBE3 sites, but no significant occupancies of β-catenin and TCF-4 were found at the TBE2 site as shown by PCR analysis of precipitated genomic DNA (Fig. 1, B and C). ChIP-qPCR analysis also showed similar patterns of protein bindings on TBE sites (Fig. 1, D and E). To confirm the involvement of these TBE sites, we used luciferase reporters with a series of deletions in the upstream region of VEGFA gene. As shown in Fig. 1F, relative ratio of transcriptional activity was significantly increased as upstream TBE1 was included, suggesting an important role of TBE1 in VEGFA transcription. Evidently, TBE2 may not be a critical site for VEGFA transcription (Fig. 1F). In the case of TBE3, luciferase reporter assays with wild-type (CTTTGAT) or mutant (CTTTACT) TBE3 clearly demonstrated the critical role of the sequence (Fig. 1G), which was consistent with a previous report (4.Zhang X. Gaspard J.P. Chung D.C. Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor by the Wnt and K-ras pathways in colonic neoplasia.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6050-6054PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, even though significant occupancies of β-catenin and TCF-4 were detected in the far upstream TBE1 site by ChIP analysis, luciferase reporters with wild-type (TACAAAG) or mutant (TAGGGAG) TBE1 site did not show the sequence dependence (Fig. 1H). These data suggest that far upstream TBE1 might be involved in VEGFA transcription in unusual way. Even though TBE1 site has atypical TBE sequence, a strong positive VEGFA transcriptional activity was shown. So we questioned how TBE1 might be involved in VEGFA gene transcription. We performed ChIP analysis before and after PPAR-δ activation by GW501516 treatment in HCT116 cells. Intriguingly, two putative PPAR-response elements (PPREs) were found near TBEs (Fig. 1A), so we analyzed whether β-catenin and TCF-4 occupancy was regulated by PPAR-δ activation. Upon GW501516 treatment, the binding patterns of β-catenin and TCF-4 were changed on TBE1, with a drastic reduction in β-catenin occupancy but with a slight increase in TCF-4 binding (Fig. 2A). PPAR-δ binding was enhanced after GW501516 treatment if we compared the binding of FLAG-tagged PPAR-δ (Fig. 2A). Striking and dynamic remodeling of three proteins on TBE1 suggested that it was an important regulatory element for PPAR-δ-activated VEGFA transcription. In particular, opposite binding patterns of β-catenin (dissociation) and TCF-4 and PPAR-δ (association) were noticed after GW501516 treatment by ChIP-qPCR analysis (Fig. 2B). Such dynamic remodeling of transcription factors was in striking contrast to other TBEs in the VEGFA promoter. In the case of TBE3, PPAR-δ activation lead to enhanced β-catenin occupancy accompanied by TCF-4 DNA-binding protein (Fig. 2, A and C), implying the formation of an typically active form of β-catenin/TCF-4 transcription complex on TBE3. PPAR-δ also associated with TBE3 more than with TBE1 (Fig. 2, A and C). Because TBE1 demonstrated β-catenin dissociation upon PPAR-δ activation (Fig. 2, A and B), we then asked whether it was dependent on wild-type the TBE sequence. Significant GW501516-activated increase of luciferase activity was shown only when the TBE1 was wild type but not in mutant form (Fig. 2D). In contrast, TBE3 appeared not to be essential for GW501516-activated VEGFA transcription (Fig. 2E) even though it was critical for β-catenin-mediated basal VEGFA transcription (Fig. 1G). So far, TBE1 seemed to be important for PPAR-δ activated VEGFA transcription but with atypical binding behaviors of β-catenin, TCF-4, and PPAR-δ. ChIP analyses demonstrated the distinct binding patterns of β-catenin/TCF/PPAR-δ on TBE1, and a luciferase assay identified upstream TBE1 as an important site for PPAR-δ-activated VEGFA transcription. However, it was unclear how TBE1 activated VEGFA transcription. Based on previous reports that β-catenin binds upstream and downstream TBE sites on some target genes (33.Yochum G.S. Cleland R. Goodman R.H. A genome-wide screen for β-catenin binding sites identifies a downstream enhancer element that controls c-Myc gene expression.Mol. Cell.

Jeong S. β-Catenin binds to the downstream region and regulates the expression C-reactive protein gene.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5511-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we reasoned that β-catenin could mediate the formation of chromatin loops near the VEGFA gene thru TBE1 binding. To test this, we designed a 3C experiment and looked for possible downstream BamHI fragments of the VEGFA gene mediating chromatin looping with TBE1. An upstream TBE1 site was fixed as an anchor, and other possible looping fragments were detected with downstream 3C primers (Fig. 3A). The BAC clone with the VEGFA gene was used to validate PCR primer efficiency and to normalize the 3C signal (Fig. 3B). Robust looping to fragments #8, #12, and #14 were observed when 3C experiments were performed with HCT116 cells grown in basal conditions. However, strikingly, when VEGFA transcription was activated by GW501516, chromatin looping at the TBE1 site was completely released (Fig. 3B). If looping frequency from the anchor fragment was shown as relative proximity from TBE1, fragment #12, which was located 20.2 kb downstream from TBE1, showed the strongest looping frequency (Fig. 3C). More importantly, chromatin loops were completely released in response to GW501516 treatment (Fig. 3, B and C). As chromatin loops are formed around the VEGFA gene, we then asked whether β-catenin is critical for looping. Chromatin looping was greatly reduced up to 60% after Β-CATENIN knockdown in comparison to control knockdown with siGFP (Fig. 3, D and E). These data clearly demonstrated that β-catenin is involved in the formation of chromatin loops around the VEGFA gene, which can be released by activating PPARδ. After identifying the role of β-catenin in chromatin loops around the VEGFA gene, we looked for putative TBEs located downstream of the gene and named them downstream TBEs (TBE-DS). As indicated in Fig. 4A, some prominent TBE sites (TBE-DS5 and TBE-DS6) were predicted in the most likely looping fragment, #12, which could be β-catenin/TCF-4 binding sites. To validate these candidate binding sites, we performed a ChIP analysis with β-catenin and TCF-4 antibodies (Fig. 4B). β-Catenin bound to TBE-DS without activation, which was somewhat enhanced by GW501516 treatment. Interestingly, TCF-4 binding to TBE-DS was not significantly higher in comparison to the negative control, suggesting that occupancy of β-catenin in TBE-DS is independent of TCF-4 binding (Fig. 4, B and C). Therefore, we concluded that β-catenin, but not TCF-4, bound downstream fragments via TBE-DS sites in fragment #12. However, it was unclear whether the VEGFA downstream region was important for gene transcription. Thus, we constructed −2.3 kb VEGFA promoter driven luciferase reporters with or without downstream fragment #12 containing TBE-DS (Fig. 4D). When downstream fragment #12 was included in the reporter (−2.3-kb + DS), a significant reduction in luciferase activity was noticed not only for GW501516-induced VEGFA transcription but also for basal level transcription. This suggested a repressive role for downstream fragment #12 on VEGFA transcription. These findings were consistent with the 3C and ChIP data for β-catenin-mediated chromatin looping, which further suggested a repressive role for downstream fragment #12. We also confirmed the repressive role of β-catenin for VEGFA transcription in HCT116 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate β-catenin-mediated chromatin looping and repression of transcription via TBE-DS sites in fragment #12. Because β-catenin occupies the downstream fragme"

We show here that Porphyromonas gingivalis Dps (PgDps), previously described as an iron-storage and DNA-binding protein, also mediates heme sequestration. We determined that heme binds strongly to PgDps with an apparent K(d) of 3.7 × 10(-8) m and is coordinated by a single surface-located cysteine at the fifth axial ligand position. Heme and iron sequestered in separate sites by PgDps provide protection of DNA from H(2)O(2)-mediated free radical damage and were found to be important for growth of P. gingivalis under excess heme as the only iron source. Conservation of the heme-coordinating cysteine among Dps isoforms from the Bacteroidales order suggests that this function may be a common feature within these anaerobic bacteria."

Intracellular trafficking is an essential feature of all eukaryotic cells. Cargo molecules are transported among the different membrane-bound compartments by highly regulated membrane fusion events. In particular, exocytosis is the fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane. A complex molecular machinery, well conserved along evolution, is necessary to fuse intracellular compartments.

The SNARE superfamily comprises a large set of proteins carrying a characteristic ∼60-residue “SNARE motif” with heptad repeats (6.Brunger A.T. Structure and function of SNARE and SNARE-interacting proteins.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2005; 38: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These motifs are assembled in four-helix bundles characteristic of SNARE complexes. SNAREs in opposite membranes assemble into trans-SNARE complexes (also known as SNAREpins) forcing membranes close together as they zip up to promote fusion (7.Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A.

Minimal machinery for membrane fusion.Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). After fusion, the fully zippered SNAREs remaining in the fused organelle are in a cis configuration. Disassembly of these cis-SNARE complexes requires the concerted action of α-SNAP and NSF, whereby NSF uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to dissociate SNARE complexes (8.May A.P. Whiteheart S.W.

Syntaxin has a three-helix N-terminal “Habc” domain that folds back and binds the SNARE motif, precluding the formation of SNARE complexes. Considering that interactions between SNAREs are essential for exocytosis, one would expect that Munc18-1 serves as a negative regulator of exocytosis (13.Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M.

The spermatozoon, the male gamete, is a highly differentiated cell capable of finding the female gamete, sorting all the physical barriers that protect this immobile cell, and fusing with the oocyte to generate a diploid zygote (24.Yanagimachi R.

To perform these complex tasks, the spermatozoon undergoes dramatic morphological and functional changes during spermiogenesis, resulting in a very specialized cell capable of carrying out a limited set of functions with high efficiency. Sperm are excellent model cells to dissect fundamental processes such as flagellum-mediated cell motility (25.Lesich K.A. Pelle D.W. Lindemann C.B.

Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2007: 117-147Crossref Google Scholar). The acrosome reaction is a regulated secretion event essential for fertilization. As in other exocytoses, the plasma membrane and granule membrane must fuse to release the acrosomal contents. However, acrosomal exocytosis is special in several aspects. In mammals, the acrosome is a very large and flat granule covering the nucleus. The membrane facing the plasma membrane is called the outer acrosomal membrane. Upon stimulation, multiple fusion pores form, connecting the interior of the acrosome with the extracellular medium. These fusion pores expand, causing the fenestration of both membranes and the release of the granule contents together with hybrid vesicles composed of patches of plasma membrane and outer acrosomal membrane (31.Barros C. Bedford J.M. Franklin L.E. Austin C.R. Membrane vesiculation as a feature of the mammalian acrosome reaction.J. Cell Biol. 1967; 34: C1-C5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The disentanglement of cis complexes requires NSF activation, a process that is mediated by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTP1B (36.Zarelli V.E. Ruete M.C. Roggero C.M. Mayorga L.S. Tomes C.N.

The process goes through a transient stage where SNAREs are assembled in partially zippered (loose) trans complexes stabilized by complexin and resistant to tetanus toxin (TeTx) but sensitive to botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) (47.De Blas G.A. Roggero C.M. Tomes C.N. Mayorga L.S. Dynamics of SNARE assembly and disassembly during sperm acrosomal exocytosis.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e323Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).

Acrosomal swelling and membrane docking are required for hybrid vesicle formation during the human sperm acrosome reaction.Biol. Reprod. 2009; 81: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We refer to this morphological (i.e. membranes at less than 8 nm) and biochemical (i.e. sensitive to BoNTs and resistant to TeTx) condition as the “docked” state of the acrosome. The final fusion step requires a local increase of calcium coming from the acrosome through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive calcium channels (47.De Blas G.A. Roggero C.M. Tomes C.N.

Here, we describe the presence of Munc18-1 in human sperm and show that this protein has an essential role in acrosomal exocytosis. We observed that inactivation of endogenous Munc18-1 with a specific antibody precluded the stabilization of trans-SNARE complexes and inhibited acrosomal exocytosis. Addition of recombinant Munc18-1 blocked secretion by sequestering syntaxin, an effect that was rescued by α-SNAP. By electron microscopy, we observed that both the anti-Munc18-1 antibody and recombinant Munc18-1 inhibited the docking of the outer acrosomal to the plasma membrane. Recombinant streptolysin O (SLO) was obtained from Dr. Bhakdi (University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany). Spermatozoa were cultured in human tubal fluid media (as formulated by Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin.

An expression plasmid pQE-80L containing the cDNA-encoding human Rab3A was generously provided by Dr. C. López (Cuyo University, Mendoza, Argentina). Purification of His6-tagged recombinant proteins was carried out under native conditions according to instructions (Qiagen) except that the purification buffers contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, instead of 50 mm phosphate, pH 8; NaCl was 200 mm for NSF and 500 mm for the rest; lysis buffer contained 2 mm imidazole; washing buffer contained 8 mm imidazole; and elution buffer contained 400 mm imidazole. 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol were added to all buffers involved in the purification of His6-NSF. The His6 tag was cleaved from Munc18-1 by incubation with thrombin during dialysis. Thrombin activity was stopped with 2 mm PMSF. Syntaxins were extracted from bacterial pellets under denaturing conditions (6 m urea) because most of the proteins accumulated in inclusion bodies. Rab3A was prenylated and loaded with GTPγS as described previously (48.Bustos M.A. Lucchesi O. Ruete M.C. Mayorga L.S. Tomes C.N.

Recombinant protein concentrations were determined by the protein assay (Bio-Rad) in 96-well microplates. BSA was used as a standard, and the results were quantified on a 3550 microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Human semen samples were obtained from normal healthy donors. Semen was allowed to liquefy for 30–60 min at 37 °C. We used a swim-up protocol to isolate highly motile sperm. Sperm concentrations were adjusted to 7–10 × 106/ml before incubating for at least 2 h under capacitating conditions (human tubal fluid-0.5% BSA, 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air). Sperm were washed once with PBS and incubated in cold PBS containing 2.1 units/ml SLO for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed as before and resuspended in ice-cold sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Hepes-K, pH 7) containing 2 mm DTT. We added inhibitors and stimulants sequentially as indicated in the figure keys and incubated for 10–15 min at 37 °C after each addition. When indicated, we preloaded SLO-permeabilized sperm with photo-inhibitable NP-EGTA-AM before incubating in the presence of inhibitors and/or calcium, carrying out all procedures in the dark. Photolysis was induced after the last incubation by exposing twice (1 min each time) to a UV transilluminator (FBTIV-614, Fisher), mixing, and incubating for 5 min at 37 °C. Sperm were spotted on Teflon-printed slides, air-dried, and fixed/permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 1 min. Acrosomal status was evaluated by staining with FITC-coupled Pisum sativum (PSA-FITC) according to Ref. 51.Mendoza C. Carreras A. Moos J. Tesarik J.

IseA (YoeB) is a proteinaceous inhibitor against the DL-endopeptidases, peptidoglycan hydrolases. Overexpression of IseA caused significantly long chained cell morphology, because IseA inhibits the cell separation DL-endopeptidases post-translationally. Here, we report the first three-dimensional structure of IseA, determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure includes a single domain consisting of three α-helices, one 3(10)-helix, and eight β-strands, which is a novel fold like a ""hacksaw."" Noteworthy is a dynamic loop between β4 and the 3(10)-helix, which resembles a ""blade."" The electrostatic potential distribution shows that most of the surface is positively charged, but the region around the loop is negatively charged. In contrast, the LytF active-site cleft is expected to be positively charged. NMR chemical shift perturbation of IseA interacting with LytF indicated that potential interaction sites are located around the loop. Furthermore, the IseA mutants D100K/D102K and G99P/G101P at the loop showed dramatic loss of inhibition activity against LytF, compared with wild-type IseA, indicating that the β4-3(10) loop plays an important role in inhibition. Moreover, we built a complex structure model of IseA-LytF by docking simulation, suggesting that the β4-3(10) loop of IseA gets stuck deep in the cleft of LytF, and the active site is occluded. These results suggest a novel inhibition mechanism of the hacksaw-like structure, which is different from known inhibitor proteins, through interactions around the characteristic loop regions with the active-site cleft of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2088797648,"Post-transcriptional modifications of the wobble uridine (U34) of tRNAs play a critical role in reading NNA/G codons belonging to split codon boxes. In a subset of Escherichia coli tRNA, this wobble uridine is modified to 5-methylaminomethyluridine (mnm5U34) through sequential enzymatic reactions. Uridine 34 is first converted to 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine (cmnm5U34) by the MnmE-MnmG enzyme complex. The cmnm5U34 is further modified to mnm5U by the bifunctional MnmC protein. In the first reaction, the FAD-dependent oxidase domain (MnmC1) converts cmnm5U into 5-aminomethyluridine (nm5U34), and this reaction is immediately followed by the methylation of the free amino group into mnm5U34 by the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent domain (MnmC2). Aquifex aeolicus lacks a bifunctional MnmC protein fusion and instead encodes the Rossmann-fold protein DUF752, which is homologous to the methyltransferase MnmC2 domain of Escherichia coli MnmC (26% identity). Here, we determined the crystal structure of the A. aeolicus DUF752 protein at 2.5 Å resolution, which revealed that it catalyzes the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation of nm5U in vitro, to form mnm5U34 in tRNA. We also showed that naturally occurring tRNA from A. aeolicus contains the 5-mnm group attached to the C5 atom of U34. Taken together, these results support the recent proposal of an alternative MnmC1-independent shortcut pathway for producing mnm5U34 in tRNAs.

For example, in Escherichia coli tRNAGln, tRNALys, and tRNAGlu, the wobble uridine 34 is hypermodified into a 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm5s2U), 4The abbreviations used are: mnm5s2U5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridinemnm5U5-methylaminomethyluridinecmnm5U5-carboxymethylaminomethyl uridinenm5U5-aminomethyluridineAdoMetS-adenosylmethionineMTasemethyltransferaseSeMetselenomethionine. whereas in tRNAArg and tRNAGly, only a 5-mnm group is found on the nonthiolated U34 (mnm5U). In one of the two E. coli U34-containing tRNALeu molecules, the C5 atom of U34 is modified into a cmnm group, and its 2′-hydroxyl ribose is methylated into Um, leading to the doubly hypermodified cmnm5Um34 residue. In Bacillus subtilis and Mycoplasma capricolum, only cmnm5(s2)U(m)-type derivatives are found in the split codon box tRNAs (2.Jühling F. Mörl M. Hartmann R.K. Sprinzl M. Stadler P.F.

Finally, mammalian mitochondrial tRNAs contain a taurine derivative (τm5(s2)U34) (6.Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Wada T. Saigo K. Watanabe K. Taurine as a constituent of mitochondrial tRNAs.

These various derivatives of the wobble nucleoside are collectively designated as Xm5(s2)U(m), where X corresponds to distinct adducts of the minimal 5-methyluridine 34. Together with other modified nucleosides in the anticodon branch, they allow the modified tRNA to read selected mRNA codons more efficiently and accurately during translation on the ribosome (8.Björk G.R.

Several enzymes catalyze the formation of Xm5U34 derivatives in E. coli. These include the GTPase MnmE (formerly designated as TrmE), the folate-dependent MnmG (GidA), and the bifunctional oxidase methyltransferase MnmC. The 2-thiolation is catalyzed by the thiolase MnmA, and the methyltransferase TrmL mediates the 2′-hydroxyl methylation of U34, regardless of whether the C5 atom of U34 is modified (12.Armengod M.E.

Two alternative mechanisms have been proposed for the multistep enzymatic formation of mnm5U34 in tRNA (Fig. 1A). In the first pathway, the formation of 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine is catalyzed by MnmE and MnmG, using glycine, a methyl derivative of tetrahydrofolate, GTP, and FAD as cofactors. This complex reaction has been recapitulated under in vitro conditions, using purified recombinant MnmE-MnmG enzymes. However, its detailed mechanism is still a matter of debate (13.Yim L.

The C-terminal domain of this protein (designated as MnmC1) first catalyzes the transformation of the 5-cmnm adduct of U34 into a 5-aminomethyluridine intermediate (nm5U34), which is subsequently methylated to mnm5U34 by the methyltransferase of the N-terminal domain (DUF752, designated as MnmC2), using AdoMet as the methyl donor (Fig. 1A, upper part). The nm5U34-containing tRNA intermediate usually does not accumulate in normal E. coli cells, except in certain mutants such as rel−, met−, or those defective in the MnmC2 activity (19.Taya Y.

This nm5U34-containing tRNA intermediate is further methylated into the same final mnm5U34 product as above by the MnmC2 domain of the bifunctional MnmC. This nm5U-to-mnm5U methylation reaction has been demonstrated to occur in vitro, using a purified recombinant MnmC enzyme defective in the MnmC1 activity, thus showing that each of the two enzymatic activities of the fusion MnmC protein can be uncoupled and work independently in trans-complementation types of experiments (21.Bujnicki J.M.

These observations prompted us to examine the situation in Aquifex aeolicus. This bacterial species has genes encoding the MnmE, MnmG, and MnmA but only has one gene encoding a shorter version of MnmC (DUF752). This gene appears to be the homolog of MnmC2, and it seems to lack the FAD oxidase (DAO)-like MnmC1 domain (Fig. 1B). In this study, we first analyzed the A. aeolicus tRNAs and confirmed the presence of the mnm5U34-containing tRNA species. We next showed that purified A. aeolicus monofunctional DUF752 binds tRNA and displays the expected methyltransferase activity in vitro. Finally, we determined the crystal structure of A. aeolicus DUF752, which revealed the interesting tRNA-binding characteristics of this newly identified bacterial methyltransferase. Bulk tRNA from B. subtilis strain 168 (wild type) was obtained as described previously (25.Urbonavicius J. Brochier-Armanet C. Skouloubris S. Myllykallio H. Grosjean H. In vitro detection of the enzymatic activity of folate-dependent tRNA (Uracil-54,-C5)-methyltransferase. Evolutionary implications.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 425: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Bulk tRNA from A. aeolicus VF5 was obtained by the same procedure. The gene encoding the DUF752 protein (aq_1980, gi:15606976), corresponding to the putative methyltransferase MnmC2, was amplified via PCR using A. aeolicus VF5 genomic DNA and was cloned into the pET-11b expression vector (Merck Novagen). The expression vector was introduced into the E. coli BL-21(DE3) strain (Merck Novagen), and the recombinant strain was cultured in 2.5 liters of LB medium. The harvested cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT, and subsequently lysed by sonication four times for 30 s on ice (VP-30, TAITEC). After centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min (CR22GIII, Hitachi), the supernatants were heat-treated at 70 °C for 30 min and purified by a series of HiTrap-phenyl, HiTrap-Q, and Resource-S (GE Healthcare) column chromatography steps, followed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 150 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT. The protein sample was then purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare) and was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Millipore) to 11.3 mg/ml For the x-ray crystallization experiment, the selenomethionine-labeled (SeMet) A. aeolicus DUF752 protein was obtained by expression from the same pET-11b expression vector, in the methionine-auxotrophic E. coli B834(DE3) strain cultured with SeMet, instead of methionine. The protein was purified in the same manner as that for the nonlabeled proteins. For the Biacore binding assays, the Bio-tagged version of the A. aeolicus DUF752 protein was obtained by expression from the pET-11b vector (Merck Novagen) bearing the tag sequence at the N terminus (26.Tucker J. Grisshammer R. Purification of a rat neurotensin receptor expressed in Escherichia coli.Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and the protein was purified in the same manner as the native proteins. The purified protein was then biotinylated by an incubation with E. coli biotin ligase, BirA, and biotin at 37 °C for 2 h. The gene encoding MnmG (aq_761, gi:15606146) from A. aeolicus VF5 was cloned into pET-15b (Merck Novagen) and expressed in the E. coli Rosetta(DE3) strain (Merck Novagen). The harvested cells were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0), containing 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. After sonication four times for 30 s (VP-30, TAITEC) and centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min (CR22GIII, Hitachi), the supernatant was heat-treated at 60 °C for 15 min and purified by a series of HisTrap, HiTrap-Q, and HiTrap-heparin (GE Healthcare) column chromatography steps. After the last chromatography step, the sample buffer was exchanged by dialysis at 4 °C to 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0), containing 150 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT. The protein sample was then purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare) and was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Millipore) to 3.3 mg/ml. The gene encoding A. aeolicus MnmE (aq_871, gi:15606214) was cloned into pET-11b (Merck Novagen) and expressed in E. coli Rosetta(DE3) strain (Merck Novagen). The harvested cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF. After sonication four times for 30 s (VP-30, TAITEC) and centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min (CR22GIII, Hitachi), the supernatants were heat-treated at 75 °C for 15 min and purified by a series HiTrap-Q, HiTrap-heparin, and Resource-Q (GE Healthcare) column chromatography steps. The sample buffer was exchanged by dialysis at 4 °C to 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 300 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT. The protein sample was then purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare) and was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Millipore) to 7.6 mg/ml. The gene encoding MnmC (JW5380, gi: 85675355) from E. coli was cloned into pET-15b (Merck Novagen) and expressed in the E. coli Rosetta2(DE3) strain (Merck Novagen). The expression vector containing MnmC, bearing a mutation in the essential Asp-178 (D178A), was prepared using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and expressed in the same E. coli Rosetta2(DE3) strain (Merck Novagen). The purification procedures for these recombinant proteins were described previously (27.Kitamura A. Sengoku T. Nishimoto M. Yokoyama S. Bessho Y. Crystal structure of the bifunctional tRNA modification enzyme MnmC from Escherichia coli.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). For the crystallization assay, the purified A. aeolicus DUF752 protein samples were first concentrated to 13–26 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 150 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT. The SeMet DUF752 protein was co-crystallized with 1 mm AdoMet by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Preliminary screenings were performed using the Hampton Research Index Screen kit, and small crystals appeared with a reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), containing 25%(w/v) PEG 3350. After optimization, large crystals were obtained, using a reservoir solution of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), containing 25%(w/v) PEG3350 and 5%(w/v) benzamidine. Rectangular parallel-piped crystals grew to dimensions of 0.2 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm at 20 °C in 10 days. For data collection, the crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen with 13% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Diffraction data sets were collected at the BL41XU beamline at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) and were processed by the use of the HKL2000 software suite. The structure of the A. aeolicus DUF752 protein was determined by using the SeMet MAD data set, SOLVE and RESOLVE (28.Terwilliger T. SOLVE and RESOLVE. Automated structure solution, density modification, and model building.J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We used the second data set (peak 2), obtained from another crystal in the same crystallization drop, to improve the electron density map. The model (2.5 Å) was built and refined with NCS restraints by using the programs Coot (29.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17187) Google Scholar) and Refmac5 implemented in the CCP4 suite (30.Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 The CCP4 suite.

Open table in a new tab All assays were performed at 45 °C in a 300-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm PIPES (pH 6.4), 20 mm NH4Cl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 20 μm FAD, 4 μm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (2.22 GBq/mmol; GE Healthcare), 0.55 mg/ml (∼20 μm) B. subtilis total tRNA (in which the C5 atom of several tRNAs harbors a wobble cmnm5(s2)U(m)34), 0.5 μm E. coli monofunctional MnmC-D178A mutant enzyme, and 5 μm A. aeolicus DUF752 protein. The E. coli mutant enzyme was used for producing the nm5U-containing tRNA, which is the expected substrate of DUF752 (see under “Results”). At appropriate time points, 30-μl aliquots of the samples were mixed with a 20-fold volume of 10% cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and were incubated for 10 min on ice. The quenched samples were spotted on MF-Millipore membrane papers. The filters were washed five times with cold 10% TCA, and the radioactivity retained on the filter was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. The reactions were repeated five times, and the values were used to calculate the standard errors. The interactions between the tRNA and the enzymes were analyzed with a Biacore 3000 SPR bio-sensor (GE Healthcare). The gene encoding the tRNAUUULys from A. aeolicus (aq_t42, gene ID: 3284557) was amplified via PCR, using a 5′-primer including a T7 promoter and a 3′-primer lacking six nucleotides of the terminus. The biotinylated tRNA was prepared by enzymatically connecting the T7 transcripts, lacking six nucleotides of the 3′ terminus, and the synthesized 5′-p-TCACCA-biotin-3′ oligonucleotide DNA. The 3′-terminal biotinylated tRNA and the A. aeolicus DUF752 protein (MnmC2) were immobilized onto commercially prepared Biacore SA sensor chips, to yield analytes with Rmax in the range of 500–1,400 resonance units. All subsequent binding experiments were performed in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2), containing 200 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2. Each binding assay utilized 25–2,000 nm protein as the analyte, increased in at least five steps, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 3 min. All binding assays were performed at 25 °C. The kinetic parameters and the dissociation constants (KD) were determined from the sensorgram data, using the BIAevaluation 4.1 software package. The purified tRNAs were digested to nucleosides, as described previously (32.Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. McCune R.A. Gerhardt K.O. Agris P.F. Quantitative enzymatic hydrolysis of tRNAs. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography of tRNA nucleosides.J. Chromatogr. 1982; 230: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and were analyzed by HPLC (Alliance, Waters) using a Develosil 5-μm RP-AQUEOUS C-30 reverse phase column (Phenomenex). The elution was monitored at 254 and 314 nm, and the gradient was employed as described previously (32.Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. McCune R.A. Gerhardt K.O. Agris P.F.

The thiolated nucleosides s2C, mnm5s2U, and cmnm5s2U were identified by both their spectra and relative retention times to that of s4U and were compared with the relative retention times of the corresponding synthetic nucleosides. The identification of m5s2U is described under “Results” and the legend to Fig. 5. The amino acid sequence alignments of A. aeolicus DUF752 (upper line, 308 amino acids) and the N-terminal domains (254 amino acids) of the E. coli bifunctional MnmC methyltransferase (bottom line, 254 plus 414 amino acids) are shown in Fig. 2. A few additional homologous sequences from other organisms are also included between these two sequences (we also analyzed many others, data not shown). The high sequence similarity and the conservation of several key amino acids (nine altogether) suggested that both types of proteins possess similar and possibly identical functions. The sequence identity between A. aeolicus DUF752 and E. coli MnmC2 is 26%, despite the fact that these two proteins are from species that grow at very different optimal temperatures (above 40 °C and optimally at 85–95 °C in the case of the thermophilic A. aeolicus and below 40 °C and optimally at 37 °C in the case of E. coli). The MnmC2 domains (N-terminal domains) of the bifunctional MnmC and DUF752 homologs both show the typical features of the AdoMet-dependent class I (Rossmann-fold) MTase family (motifs X and I–VIII, underlined in blue in Fig. 2) (34.Schubert H.L.

The features include the partially conserved (GX)GXG sequence within motif I, followed by a conserved Asn residue at the end of the β4 region.

Post-translational modifications play a critical role in modulating RB activity, but additional levels of control, including protein turnover, are also essential for proper function. The Drosophila RB homolog Rbf1 is subjected to developmentally cued proteolysis mediated by an instability element (IE) present in the C terminus of this protein. Paradoxically, instability mediated by the IE is also linked to Rbf1 repression potency, suggesting that proteolytic machinery may also be directly involved in transcriptional repression. We show that the Rbf1 IE is an autonomous degron that stimulates both Rbf1 ubiquitination and repression potency. Importantly, Rbf1 IE function is promoter-specific, contributing to repression of cell cycle responsive genes but not to repression of cell signaling genes. The multifunctional IE domain thus provides Rbf1 flexibility for discrimination between target genes embedded in divergent cellular processes.

Sage J. Cellular mechanisms of tumour suppression by the retinoblastoma gene.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Consistent with this property, the RB1 gene is inactivated in a broad range of human cancers, often as a seminal event contributing to both cancer initiation and cancer progression (2.Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42748) Google Scholar). RB has been further implicated in the governance of diverse physiological processes, including differentiation and apoptosis, and as a central hub connecting these processes, RB activity is subjected to strict control by post-translational modification during normal growth and development (3.Nguyen D.X.

Indeed, in many tumor types, upstream regulatory pathways governing RB are inactivated with similar frequencies as inactivation of RB itself, attesting to the importance of close supervision over RB function (5.Wikenheiser-Brokamp K.A.

In an intricate network of gene control, RB and its related family members, p107 and p130, function as transcriptional repressors of diverse gene sets through interactions with members of the E2F family of transcriptional activator proteins (6.Genovese C.

Retinoblastoma protein partners.Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). RB family members govern apparently mutually exclusive physiological processes, notably cell cycle progression and apoptosis, and thus distinct regulatory mechanisms must ensure that RB-mediated induction of apoptosis does not ensue, even as RB proteins are periodically activated on cell cycle genes during normal proliferation (8.Delston R.B. Harbour J.W. Rb at the interface between cell cycle and apoptotic decisions.Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 713-718PubMed Google Scholar). Canonical regulation of RB activity is governed by cyclin/cdk regulatory kinases (9.Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H.

Timely phosphorylation blocks RB/E2F association and unleashes waves of E2F-mediated transcription that contribute to cell cycle progression (13.Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R.

However, RB continues to reside at a number of genomic sites after cyclin/cdk-mediated deactivation (14.Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J.

Indeed, RB phosphorylation by p38 MAPK at a site that is not a target for cyclin/cdks can modulate RB-mediated repression of apoptotic response genes (8.Delston R.B. Harbour J.W. Rb at the interface between cell cycle and apoptotic decisions.Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 713-718PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Delston R.B. Matatall K.A. Sun Y.

This model suggests that RB is subjected to a protein modification code that enables gene-specific outcomes, namely cyclin/cdk kinases regulate cell cycle-responsive promoters and stress-responsive kinases regulate apoptosis-responsive promoters. In Drosophila, RB family proteins Rbf1 and Rbf2 interact with E2F transcription factors as corepressors, similar to their mammalian counterparts. Drosophila Rbf proteins are also controlled by a canonical phosphorylation mechanism through cyclin-cdk complexes (17.Du W. Vidal M. Xie J.E. Dyson N.

Mutant rbf1 embryos show constitutive expression of PCNA and RNR2, two E2F1-regulated genes for DNA replication, and ectopic S-phase entry, indicating the importance of Rbf1 for arresting cells in G1 phase (19.Du W. Dyson N. The role of RBF in the introduction of G1 regulation during Drosophila embryogenesis.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Rbf1 associates at numerous canonical E2F cell cycle-regulated genes in the early embryo (20.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. A revised picture of the E2F transcriptional network and RB function.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), indicating that key components of the RB regulatory pathway are evolutionarily conserved. However, in the embryo, Rbf1 also associates with numerous E2F1-independent target genes beyond the canonical cadre of E2F1-dependent target genes (22.Acharya P. Negre N. Johnston J. Wei Y.

Evidence for autoregulation and cell signaling pathway regulation from genome-wide binding of the Drosophila retinoblastoma protein.Genes Genomes Genet. 2012; (in press)Google Scholar, 23.Korenjak M.

Cell Biol. 2012; 32: 4375-4387Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Many of these candidate E2F1-independent target genes encode components of signaling pathways, exemplified by the insulin receptor (InR), and whose expression is regulated independently of the cell cycle. Thus, Drosophila Rbf regulatory influence during development appears to extend beyond cell cycle progression and apoptosis to include cellular signaling, although in a mechanism likely independent of E2F1. In addition to regulation by phosphorylation, Rbf proteins are subject to developmental regulation of their proteolytic turnover. Developmental regulation occurs in imaginal disc tissue (20.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with stability controlled by the COP9 signalosome (24.Ullah Z. Buckley M.S. Arnosti D.N. Henry R.W. Retinoblastoma protein regulation by the COP9 signalosome.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a developmentally regulated complex that controls proteasome-mediated protein degradation via modulation of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (25.Bech-Otschir D.

The COP9 signalosome is physically associated with Rbf1 and Rbf2, and depletion of COP9 subunits stimulates Rbf1 turnover (24.Ullah Z. Buckley M.S. Arnosti D.N. Henry R.W. Retinoblastoma protein regulation by the COP9 signalosome.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rbf1 stability is influenced by a C-terminal instability element (IE) that positively contributes to both repressor destruction and repressor potency (20.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conservation of the IE in mammalian RB family proteins suggests that these pathways operate in higher eukaryotes; however, the function of the IE in integrating protein turnover and transcriptional control is poorly understood. Here, we show that the Rbf1 IE is sufficient to facilitate ubiquitination and turnover and directly mediates transcriptional repression. Strikingly, Rbf1 ubiquitination enhances E2F1-dependent PCNA repression but not E2F1-independent repression of InR transcription. Thus, the IE is a key protein motif directing promoter-specific activity of Rbf1. These studies reveal a novel level of regulatory discrimination within the RB protein modification code that enables gene-specific repression during development. Generation of Rbf1 WT and mutant expression constructs was described previously (20.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate GFP fusion proteins, enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) cDNA was PCR-amplified from phs-eGFP and cloned into KpnI site of pAX vector. Two FLAG epitope tags were inserted 5′ of the stop codon. The C terminus and the IE of Rbf1 were made by site-directed mutagenesis. To minimize the differences among mRNAs transcribed from GFP fusion protein constructs, the first two amino acids of the IE were mutated into stop codons to generate GFP alone constructs. Tet fusion protein expression constructs were generated as described previously (27.Ryu J.R. Arnosti D.N. Functional similarity of Knirps CtBP-dependent and CtBP-independent transcriptional repressor activities.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Rbf1 WT and mutants were digested from pAX-rbf1 vector and ligated into KpnI and XbaI sites of pAX-Tet vector. The C terminus and the IE were amplified with KpnI and XbaI on the ends and inserted into pAX-Tet vector. To generate ubiquitin fusion proteins, the ubiquitin coding sequence was amplified using oligonucleotides with KpnI sites on both ends, and the amplicon was inserted into the KpnI site of the pAX vector. The C-terminal glycine residues at the junction were initially mutated to alanine to prevent ubiquitin removal by isopeptidases (Ub-Rbf1-ΔIE, see Fig. 6D) and then to isoleucine (Ub-Rbf1, see Fig. 6, B and C) to provide a more complete block to cleavage. Drosophila S2 cells were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Typically, 1.5 million cells were transfected with 100 ng of Ac5C2T50-luciferase reporter, 0.25 μg of pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase reporter (Promega), and 20 ng of one of pAX-Tet-rbf1 constructs. For PCNA-luciferase assay, 1.5 million cells were transfected with 1 μg of PCNA-luciferase reporter, 250 ng of pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase reporter (Promega), and 200 ng of pAX Rbf1-WT, pAX Rbf1-ΔIE, or pAX-Ub-Rbf1-ΔIE constructs. 1000 ng of pAX-Ub-Rbf1-WT and 3 ng of pAX Rbf1-WT were used in Fig. 6B. Cells were harvested 3 days after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) and quantified using the Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity except when analyzing Rbf1 activity on the InR promoter. For doxycycline treatment (1 μg/ml), the drug was added to the media immediately after transfection. To measure protein levels in S2 cell culture, cells were harvested 3 or 5 days after transfection and lysed by freeze-and-thaw cycles three times in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Typically, 50 μg of S2 cell lysates were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane for analysis using M2 anti-FLAG (mouse monoclonal, 1:10,000, Sigma, F3165), anti-GFP (mouse monoclonal, 1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-9996), and anti-tubulin (mouse monoclonal, 1:20,000, Iowa Hybridoma Bank). Antibody incubation was performed in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were developed using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For determination of GFP fusion protein half-life, 1.5 million S2 cells were transfected with 200 ng of pAX-GFP-Rbf1-IE or 400 ng of pAX-GFP. After a 3-day incubation, cells were treated with 100 μm cycloheximide for the indicated times. For proteasome inhibitor treatments in Figs. 2B and 6A, 72 h after transfection, cells were treated with DMSO or DMSO containing 50 μg/ml MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h. In experiments shown in Fig. 2, A and B, S2 cells were co-transfected with 250 ng of pAX Rbf1-WT, 250 ng of pAcGal4, and 250 ng of UAS-Ub constructs using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). In Fig. 3A, cells were transfected with 50 ng pAX Rbf1-WT or pAX Rbf1-ΔIE, 50 ng of pAcGal4, and 50 ng of UAS-Ub constructs. In Fig. 3B, cells were transfected with 200 ng of Rbf1 WT, 400 ng of pAX-GFP-FLAG, and 200 ng of pAX GFP-Rbf1-IE constructs. In all cases, cells were grown for 3 days, after which extracts were prepared using SDS lysis buffer (2% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The extracts were heat-denatured and sonicated followed by a 10-fold dilution using dilution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). FLAG immunoprecipitation reactions were performed (anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, Sigma) followed by anti-HA Western blotting (mouse polyclonal antibody, 1:5000 dilution). Drosophila Rbf proteins are subjected to developmentally regulated turnover, exhibiting tissue-specific modulation in both the developing embryo and the larvae (20.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Keller S.A. Ullah Z. Buckley M.S. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Distinct developmental expression of Drosophila retinoblastoma factors.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2005; 5: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism underlying this regulation, we tested whether the Rbf1-IE can autonomously control protein stability by fusing the IE region (728–786) to GFP (Fig. 1A) and measuring the half-lives of GFP and GFP-Rbf1-IE chimeras in S2 cells after cycloheximide treatment. Steady state levels of GFP-Rbf1-IE, but not GFP, were substantially decreased by 12 h after cycloheximide challenge, indicating that the IE directly enhanced GFP turnover (Fig. 1B). Thus, the IE region can function autonomously as a degron and independently of other domains within Rbf1. This ability is consistent with the previously discovered role of the IE in control of full-length Rbf1 stability during development (20.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous models of degron function indicate that subcellular location of substrate proteins influences turnover (29.Hammond-Martel I. Yu H. Affar el B. Roles of ubiquitin signaling in transcription regulation.Cell. Signal. 2012; 24: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine the effect of substrate localization on Rbf1 degron function, the Rbf1 nuclear localization signal (NLS, supplemental Fig. S1) was appended to GFP-Rbf1-IE, largely confining the chimera protein to the nucleus (Fig. 1C). Accumulation of the GFP chimera proteins was then measured, testing lysine-to-alanine substitutions within the IE that were previously shown to both inactivate and stabilize wild type Rbf1 (20.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments, both GFP-Rbf1-IE (−NLS) and GFP-Rbf1-C (+NLS) behaved similarly, with Lys-to-Ala mutants accumulating to levels ∼3-fold higher than those of their wild type counterparts. Consistent with these observations, the GFP-Rbf1-IE 4KA mutant displayed a significantly longer half-life as compared with GFP-Rbf-IE (supplemental Fig. S2). The steady state levels of both GFP-Rbf1-IE and GFP-Rbf1-C were unaffected by lysine-to-arginine substitution of the same amino acids, indicating that the positive charges of the side chains are important for IE substrate destabilization and that these lysine residues are unlikely targets for ubiquitination (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that the function of the IE as a modular degron is unaffected by its preferential nuclear localization and is consistent with a model wherein some components of the Rbf1 degradation pathway occur in the nucleus. Regulated protein turnover often involves the activity of the 26S proteasome, which interacts with substrates that have been modified with ubiquitin, but also in some cases proteins that are not ubiquitinated. In mammals, RB and p107 are substrates of E3 ubiquitin ligases and are turned over in a proteasome-dependent manner (30.Barbash O. Lin D.I. Diehl J.A.

Targeting retinoblastoma protein for degradation by proteasomes.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 506-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rbf1 is likewise dependent on the proteasome pathway, but there are no reports of ubiquitination of this protein. To test whether Rbf1 is ubiquitinated in vivo, we expressed FLAG-tagged Rbf1 and HA-tagged ubiquitin proteins in S2 cells and immunoprecipitated the Rbf1 proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A, polyubiquitinated Rbf1 species were detected in heat-denatured extracts prepared from cells co-expressing both FLAG-Rbf1 and HA-ubiquitin. Ubiquitinated species were not observed in mock-transfected samples, in samples containing only one of the two proteins, or in extracts containing Rbf1 and HA-ubiquitin from denatured extracts containing individually expressed HA-Ub or FLAG-Rbf1 proteins that were mixed together prior to immunoprecipitation. In the presence of the MG132 proteasome inhibitor, higher levels of polyubiquitinated Rbf1 were observed (Fig. 2B). We conclude that the Rbf1 protein was ubiquitinated in vivo and is targeted for proteasome-mediated turnover, an outcome that is consistent with previous observations linking the COP9 signalosome to protection of Rbf1 from destruction by the proteasome (24.Ullah Z. Buckley M.S. Arnosti D.N. Henry R.W. Retinoblastoma protein regulation by the COP9 signalosome.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rbf1 lacking the IE region (Rbf1-ΔIE) exhibited a substantial reduction, but not complete loss, of Rbf1 ubiquitination (Fig. 3A), a result that was also observed for Rbf1-4KA (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that the IE enhances ubiquitination, but is not essential for all modification events. We tested whether the IE is sufficient to independently drive ubiquitination by co-expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin and the GFP-IE chimera. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3B, levels of polyubiquitinated GFP were substantially increased by appending the Rbf1-IE region as compared with levels observed for untagged GFP. GFP-Rbf1 IE ubiquitination was reduced by the introduction of the 4KA substitutions (supplemental Fig. S4). Together, these data show that one function of the Rbf1 IE is to facilitate substrate ubiquitination. We showed previously that in addition to influencing protein stability, the IE region is critical for Rbf1 repressor activity on E2F1-dependent promoters, such as PCNA and Polα (20.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the Rbf1 degron functions as a bona fide transcriptional repression domain. To test this hypothesis, the Rbf1 degron alone or degron plus NLS was fused to the Tet repressor, and the activity of these proteins was assayed on an Actin5C reporter harboring two Tet binding sites (Fig. 4A). Indeed, when directly tethered to its target promoter in the absence of doxycycline, both Tet-Rbf1-IE and Tet-Rbf1-C showed strong repression activity at levels approaching that observed with Tet-Knirps, a potent short range repressor that was included as a positive control on this reporter (Fig. 4B). As expected, treatment with doxycycline to inhibit DNA binding also diminished repression (not show). The Tet repressor DNA binding domain alone lacked notable repression activity. These data are consistent with a direct role for the IE in transcriptional repression. Interestingly, both Tet-Rbf1-C and Tet-Rbf1-IE harboring the Lys-to-Ala substitutions repressed transcription to similar levels as observed for the wild type Tet-Rbf1-IE chimera. Thus, these lysine residues that influence repression in the context of full-length Rbf1 are not essential in this context (20.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G.

The ability of the IE to independently repress transcription next prompted us to examine whether the IE is an essential element within full-length Rbf1 when targeted to a promoter independently of E2F1. Strikingly, the Tet-Rbf1 chimera lacking the IE (Tet-Rbf1-ΔIE) was not compromised for activity; the protein repressed transcription from the Actin5C-Tet reporter as effectively as did the wild type Tet-Rbf1 chimera, indicating that the IE is not essential in this context (Fig. 4C). When assayed on the PCNA reporter that lacks Tet binding sites but utilizes E2F1 to recruit Rbf1, the Tet-Rbf1-ΔIE chimera was compromised for repression, consistent with previous observations that the IE is important for Rbf1 repression of cell cycle genes (20.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this outcome suggests that the mechanism of promoter targeting does influence whether the IE region functions in repression. Interestingly, both Tet-Rbf1-C (4KA) and Tet-Rbf1-IE (4KA) were expressed at similar levels as their wild type counterparts and under conditions wherein the same alanine substitutions increased Tet-full-length Rbf1 steady state levels (Fig. 4D). These observations suggest that the function of these IE-lysine residues is context-dependent for both repression and stability. The substantial repression exhibited by the Rbf1-ΔIE mutant protein when directly recruited to the Tet promoter demonstrated that this protein is not inherently defective. This observation also raised the interesting possibility that the IE provides gene-specific repression capability. To examine the possibility that the IE provides repression capability specifically in the context of E2F1-regulated promoters, the repression potency of wild type Rbf1 was compared with Rbf1-ΔIE on E2F1-regulated promoters (PCNA, Polα, and Mcm7) (Fig. 5A) and noncanonical E2F1-independent promoters (InR, wts, and Pi3K68D) (Fig. 5B). The InR, wts, and Pi3K68D gene promoters are devoid of recognizable E2F1 binding sites and were refractory to activation by E2F1, but are directly bound by Rbf1 in the embryo (22.Acharya P. Negre N. Johnston J. Wei Y. White K.P. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Evidence for autoregulation and cell signaling pathway regulation from genome-wide binding of the Drosophila retinoblastoma protein.Genes Genomes Genet. 2012; (in press)Google Scholar). On the canonical target genes, Rbf1-ΔIE was much weaker than wild type Rbf1 for E2F1-dependent gene repression, but both repressors exhibited similar potency on the noncanonical Rbf1 reporter genes. As previous data showed that Rbf1-ΔIE can interact with E2F1 and associate with endogenous E2F1 target genes (22.Acharya P. Negre N. Johnston J. Wei Y. White K.P. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Evidence for autoregulation and cell signaling pathway regulation from genome-wide binding of the Drosophila retinoblastoma protein.Genes Genomes Genet. 2012; (in press)Google Scholar), the IE may provide post-recruitment functions that are dispensable when Rbf1 is recruited independently of E2F1. The function of the instability element as both a repression domain and a degron that stimulates Rbf1 ubiquitination suggested that ubiquitin might function directly in Rbf1-mediated repression. We showed above that MG132 treatment substantially increases the levels of ubiquitinated Rbf1. Therefore, we measured Rbf1-mediated repression of the PCNA reporter in the presence or absence of MG132 (Fig. 6A). A modest but reproducible enhancement in repression potency of wild type Rbf1 was observed within 2 h of drug treatment, an effect that was not observed with the Rbf1-ΔIE mutant. These data are consistent with IE-directed ubiquitination influencing repression activity. Although MG132 affected only the wild type Rbf1, a general concern remained that global proteasome inhibition may induce pleiotropic effects (34.Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Proteasome inhibitors reduce luciferase and β-galactosidase activity in tissue culture cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20120-20123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, to directly assess the effect of ubiquitin on Rbf1 function, repression assays were performed using chimera proteins containing ubiquitin fused to the N terminus of full-length Rbf1. As ubiquitin attachment markedly destabilized full-length Rbf1 (see also Fig. 6C), consistent with this modification directing Rbf1 for proteasome destruction, repression assays were performed using differing amounts of expression plasmids to equalize repressor concentration. Under conditions wherein both Rbf1 and Ub-Rbf1 were expressed at comparable levels, the presence of ubiquitin markedly improved Rbf1 repression activity on the PCNA promoter on average 4–5-fold (Fig. 6B). This outcome supports the hypothesis that ubiquitin can contribute directly to target gene repression. The potent role of ubiquitin in Rbf1 target gene repression noted above allowed the possibility to examine whether polyubiquitination at this site is essential for enhanced repressor potency. To test this possibility, K48R and K63R substitutions were incorporated within the N-terminal ubiquitin at positions expected to impede polyubiquitination. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 6C, Rbf1 appended with mutant ubiquitin (K48R and K63R) was maintained at higher steady state levels than Rbf1 fused to wild type ubiquitin when expressed using comparable amounts of expression plasmid. Thus, the N-terminal ubiquitin was functional in the proteasome-mediated turnover of Rbf1. When compared with wild type Rbf1 lacking ubiquitin, Rbf1 harboring mutant ubiquitin remained a more potent repressor of PCNA transcription. This result suggests that although ubiquitination at the Rbf1 N terminus can contribute to repression potency, polyubiquitination at this site is not essential for this enhancement. Nonetheless, in all experiments, Rbf1 containing wild type ubiquitin did exhibit improved specific activity, suggesting that higher order ubiquitination can contribute to repression. Based on the observation that Rbf1-ΔIE is defective for repression on E2F1 target genes, whether the forced ubiquitination of Rbf1-ΔIE could stimulate repression potency was tested. In this experiment, higher levels of Rbf1-ΔIE were tested to ensure that active proteins were being compared. Under these conditions, and despite substantially lower steady state protein levels associated with forced ubiquitination, Rbf1-ΔIE harboring the appended wild type ubiquitin exhibited increased repression ability of PCNA transcription (Fig. 6D). However, ubiquitin did not enhance Rbf1-ΔIE repression of the InR reporter, suggesting that the effect of this modification is restricted to certain types of target genes. These observations imply that insufficient ubiquitination observed with IE deletion underlies the loss of repression activity at cell cycle-regulated genes. The RB family of proteins governs diverse physiological processes including cell cycle, apoptosis, and differentiation. An important question remains how these factors maintain differential influence over mutually exclusive pathways. Previous studies demonstrated that mammalian RB phosphorylation by cell cycle-dependent kinases or stress-responsive kinases can distinguish between cell cycle arrest or apoptotic responses (16.Delston R.B. Matatall K.A. Sun Y. Onken M.D. Harbour J.W. p38 phosphorylates Rb on Ser567 by a novel, cell cycle-independent mechanism that triggers Rb-Hdm2 interaction and apoptosis.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study of the Drosophila Rbf1 protein, we uncovered a direct role for ubiquitination in differential gene regulation. In particular, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Rbf1 was found to harbor an independently acting degron that directs Rbf1 ubiquitination. Post-translational modification by ubiquitin improved Rbf1 transcriptional repression, directly linking repressor potency to ubiquitin-mediated turnover pathways. Furthermore, Rbf1 lacking the degron was also debilitated for repression of cell cycle-regulated PCNA, Polα, and Mcm7 promoters, but not for regulation of noncanonical Rbf1 target genes, thus highlighting a role for ubiquitination in differential regulation of Rbf target genes. These findings point to distinct modes of transcriptional repression depending upon the promoters targeted. Recent genomic studies have shown that Rbf1 association at many noncanonical promoters, including the InR locus, is independent of E2F1 but is dependent upon the general E2F partner, DP1 (23.Korenjak M. Anderssen E. Ramaswamy S. Whetstine J.R. Dyson N.J. RBF binding to both canonical E2F targets and noncanonical targets depends on functional dE2F/dDP complexes.Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 32: 4375-4387Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains possible that the Rbf1 degron functions primarily when recruited by E2F1-DP1 and not when recruited by E2F2-DP1. This concept is consistent with structural studies of human RB that show the corresponding region located within the RB C terminus is important for interactions with E2F1/DP1 complexes (35.Rubin S.M. Gall A.L. Zheng N. Pavletich N.P. Structure of the Rb C-terminal domain bound to E2F1-DP1: a mechanism for phosphorylation-induced E2F release.Cell. 2005; 123: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As the Rbf1 degron sequence is highly conserved within the mammalian RB homologs p107 and p130, degron function in differential gene repression may be evolutionarily conserved. Although ubiquitin clearly enhanced Rbf1 activity toward the PCNA promoter, the molecular mechanism by which ubiquitination is associated with transcriptional repression is unknown. In one model, repression is enhanced by direct proteasome recruitment to a promoter through interactions mediated by ubiquitin. In a second model, ubiquitination serves two roles, recruiting essential cofactors to a promoter and separately interacting with the protein degradation machinery. Aspects of this mechanism are analogous to the degron theory of gene activation previously described for the c-Myc proto-oncoprotein (36.Geng F. Wenzel S. Tansey W.P.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). During activation, ubiquitin can function for co-factor recruitment, such as described for recruitment of P-TEFb by the viral activator VP16 (40.Kurosu T. Peterlin B.M. VP16 and ubiquitin; binding of P-TEFb via its activation domain and ubiquitin facilitates elongation of transcription of target genes.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and thus ubiquitin may similarly contribute to RB co-repressor recruitment. As our studies demonstrate that the C-terminal degron may recruit an E3 ligase, a direct role for these enzymes in Rbf1 gene regulation is possible. Such a direct role for E3 ligases in repression was observed for BRCA1-mediated transcriptional regulation (41.Horwitz A.A. Affar el B. Heine G.F. Shi Y. Parvin J.D. A mechanism for transcriptional repression dependent on the BRCA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6614-6619Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); however, in that example, ubiquitin interfered with assembly of the preinitiation complex. Alternatively, Rbf1-mediated E3 recruitment could promote E2F1 ubiquitination. However, the IE region does not appear to influence Rbf1-mediated E2F1 stabilization (42.Raj N. Zhang L. Wei Y. Arnosti D.N. Henry R.W. Rbf1 degron dysfunction enhances cellular DNA replication.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 3731-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Whether E3 ligases participate directly in Rbf1-mediated repression is unknown; nonetheless, observations that the COP9 signalosome, an evolutionarily conserved complex that functions to inhibit E3 ligase activity, was directly found at Rbf1 target genes simultaneously with the Rbf1 repressor (24.Ullah Z. Buckley M.S. Arnosti D.N. Henry R.W. Retinoblastoma protein regulation by the COP9 signalosome.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) suggest that a complex network of feedback regulation is proximally available at Rbf1 target gene promoters.

https://openalex.org/W2461721459,"Galactic archaeologists sift through stellar fossil records to uncover the history of our nearby universe. Akin to archaeologists interpreting the customs of ancient civilizations, clues are assembled of past events in the galaxy's lifetime based on the remnants observable today. In most galactic archaeology studies deciphering the histories of spiral galaxies like our own Milky Way, a critical assumption made for the past 30 years was that stars born in disks do not venture far from their original birthplace. The demographics of a population in a given part of the disk (see the figure) then yield a complete record of the galaxy's past, turning star counts into cosmologically relevant tools. The assumption that stars mostly stay put throughout their lives therefore carries enormous implications and wields considerable power. However, recent work on galactic disk dynamics shows that this critical assumption is likely flawed and instead many stars are expected to wander considerable distances throughout their lives. This process of radial migration affects the entire galactic disk, and if theoretical expectations are confirmed by observations, its consequences are integral to fields as diverse in scope and scale as solar system science and extragalactic galaxy formation. It was with this in mind that a workshop dedicated specifically to the issues related to radial migration in disk galaxies took place earlier this year (1)."
