https://openalex.org/W3152675680,"As organelles of the innate immune system, inflammasomes activate caspase-1 and other inflammatory caspases that cleave gasdermin D (GSDMD). Caspase-1 also cleaves inactive precursors of the interleukin (IL)-1 family to generate mature cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Cleaved GSDMD forms transmembrane pores to enable the release of IL-1 and to drive cell lysis through pyroptosis1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the pore and the prepore of GSDMD. These structures reveal the different conformations of the two states, as well as extensive membrane-binding elements including a hydrophobic anchor and three positively charged patches. The GSDMD pore conduit is predominantly negatively charged. By contrast, IL-1 precursors have an acidic domain that is proteolytically removed by caspase-110. When permeabilized by GSDMD pores, unlysed liposomes release positively charged and neutral cargoes faster than negatively charged cargoes of similar sizes, and the pores favour the passage of IL-1β and IL-18 over that of their precursors. Consistent with these findings, living—but not pyroptotic—macrophages preferentially release mature IL-1β upon perforation by GSDMD. Mutation of the acidic residues of GSDMD compromises this preference, hindering intracellular retention of the precursor and secretion of the mature cytokine. The GSDMD pore therefore mediates IL-1 release by electrostatic filtering, which suggests the importance of charge in addition to size in the transport of cargoes across this large channel."
https://openalex.org/W3155187091,"From stadium covers to solar sails, we rely on deployability for the design of large-scale structures that can quickly compress to a fraction of their size1-4. Historically, two main strategies have been used to design deployable systems. The first and most frequently used approach involves mechanisms comprising interconnected bar elements, which can synchronously expand and retract5-7, occasionally locking in place through bistable elements8,9. The second strategy makes use of inflatable membranes that morph into target shapes by means of a single pressure input10-12. Neither strategy, however, can be readily used to provide an enclosed domain that is able to lock in place after deployment: the integration of a protective covering in linkage-based constructions is challenging and pneumatic systems require a constant applied pressure to keep their expanded shape13-15. Here we draw inspiration from origami-the Japanese art of paper folding-to design rigid-walled deployable structures that are multistable and inflatable. Guided by geometric analyses and experiments, we create a library of bistable origami shapes that can be deployed through a single fluidic pressure input. We then combine these units to build functional structures at the metre scale, such as arches and emergency shelters, providing a direct route for building large-scale inflatable systems that lock in place after deployment and offer a robust enclosure through their stiff faces."

However, few large-scale and no cross-national studies have been conducted to date that investigate modifiable pandemic-related behavioral or cognitive factors that may influence mental health in this vulnerable group. This international study sought to identify and measure the associations between pandemic-related information seeking, worries, and prevention behaviors on perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant and postpartum women was conducted in 64 countries between May 26, 2020 and June 13, 2020. The survey, available in twelve languages, was hosted on the Pregistry platform for COVID-19 studies ( https://corona.pregistry.com ) and advertised in social media channels and online parenting forums. Participants completed measures on demographics, COVID-19 exposure and worries, information seeking, COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and mental health symptoms including posttraumatic stress via the IES-6, anxiety/depression via the PHQ-4, and loneliness via the UCLA-3. Of the 6,894 participants, substantial proportions of women scored at or above the cut-offs for elevated posttraumatic stress (2,979 [43%]), anxiety/depression (2,138 [31%], and loneliness (3,691 [53%]). Information seeking from any source (e.g., social media, news, talking to others) five or more times per day was associated with more than twice the odds of elevated posttraumatic stress and anxiety/depression, in adjusted models. A majority of women (86%) reported being somewhat or very worried about COVID-19. The most commonly reported worries were related to pregnancy and delivery, including family being unable to visit after delivery (59%), the baby contracting COVID-19 (59%), lack of a support person during delivery (55%), and COVID-19 causing changes to the delivery plan (41%). Greater worries related to children (i.e., inadequate childcare, their infection risk) and missing medical appointments were associated with significantly higher odds of posttraumatic stress, anxiety/depression and loneliness. Engaging in hygiene-related COVID-19 prevention behaviors (face mask-wearing, washing hands, disinfecting surfaces) were not related to mental health symptoms or loneliness. Elevated posttraumatic stress, anxiety/depression, and loneliness are highly prevalent in pregnant and postpartum women across 64 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive information seeking and worries related to children and medical care are associated with elevated symptoms, whereas engaging in hygiene-related preventive measures were not. In addition to screening and monitoring mental health symptoms, addressing excessive information seeking and women’s worries about access to medical care and their children’s well-being, and developing strategies to target loneliness (e.g., online support groups) should be part of intervention efforts for perinatal women. Public health campaigns and medical care systems need to explicitly address the impact of COVID-19 related stressors on mental health in perinatal women, as prevention of viral exposure itself does not mitigate the pandemic’s mental health impact."
https://openalex.org/W3155336766,"Global peatlands store more carbon than is naturally present in the atmosphere1,2. However, many peatlands are under pressure from drainage-based agriculture, plantation development and fire, with the equivalent of around 3 per cent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases emitted from drained peatland3–5. Efforts to curb such emissions are intensifying through the conservation of undrained peatlands and re-wetting of drained systems6. Here we report eddy covariance data for carbon dioxide from 16 locations and static chamber measurements for methane from 41 locations in the UK and Ireland. We combine these with published data from sites across all major peatland biomes. We find that the mean annual effective water table depth (WTDe; that is, the average depth of the aerated peat layer) overrides all other ecosystem- and management-related controls on greenhouse gas fluxes. We estimate that every 10 centimetres of reduction in WTDe could reduce the net warming impact of CO2 and CH4 emissions (100-year global warming potentials) by the equivalent of at least 3 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year, until WTDe is less than 30 centimetres. Raising water levels further would continue to have a net cooling effect until WTDe is within 10 centimetres of the surface. Our results suggest that greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands drained for agriculture could be greatly reduced without necessarily halting their productive use. Halving WTDe in all drained agricultural peatlands, for example, could reduce emissions by the equivalent of over 1 per cent of global anthropogenic emissions. Halving average drainage depths in agricultural peatlands could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of 1 per cent of all anthropogenic emissions."
https://openalex.org/W3156330672,"Successfully interfacing enzymes and biomachinery with polymers affords on-demand modification and/or programmable degradation during the manufacture, utilization and disposal of plastics, but requires controlled biocatalysis in solid matrices with macromolecular substrates1-7. Embedding enzyme microparticles speeds up polyester degradation, but compromises host properties and unintentionally accelerates the formation of microplastics with partial polymer degradation6,8,9. Here we show that by nanoscopically dispersing enzymes with deep active sites, semi-crystalline polyesters can be degraded primarily via chain-end-mediated processive depolymerization with programmable latency and material integrity, akin to polyadenylation-induced messenger RNA decay10. It is also feasible to achieve processivity with enzymes that have surface-exposed active sites by engineering enzyme-protectant-polymer complexes. Poly(caprolactone) and poly(lactic acid) containing less than 2 weight per cent enzymes are depolymerized in days, with up to 98 per cent polymer-to-small-molecule conversion in standard soil composts and household tap water, completely eliminating current needs to separate and landfill their products in compost facilities. Furthermore, oxidases embedded in polyolefins retain their activities. However, hydrocarbon polymers do not closely associate with enzymes, as their polyester counterparts do, and the reactive radicals that are generated cannot chemically modify the macromolecular host. This study provides molecular guidance towards enzyme-polymer pairing and the selection of enzyme protectants to modulate substrate selectivity and optimize biocatalytic pathways. The results also highlight the need for in-depth research in solid-state enzymology, especially in multi-step enzymatic cascades, to tackle chemically dormant substrates without creating secondary environmental contamination and/or biosafety concerns."
https://openalex.org/W3155018287,"Telomerase adds telomeric repeats at chromosome ends to compensate for the telomere loss that is caused by incomplete genome end replication1. In humans, telomerase is upregulated during embryogenesis and in cancers, and mutations that compromise the function of telomerase result in disease2. A previous structure of human telomerase at a resolution of 8 Å revealed a vertebrate-specific composition and architecture3, comprising a catalytic core that is flexibly tethered to an H and ACA (hereafter, H/ACA) box ribonucleoprotein (RNP) lobe by telomerase RNA. High-resolution structural information is necessary to develop treatments that can effectively modulate telomerase activity as a therapeutic approach against cancers and disease. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of human telomerase holoenzyme bound to telomeric DNA at sub-4 Å resolution, which reveals crucial DNA- and RNA-binding interfaces in the active site of telomerase as well as the locations of mutations that alter telomerase activity. We identified a histone H2A-H2B dimer within the holoenzyme that was bound to an essential telomerase RNA motif, which suggests a role for histones in the folding and function of telomerase RNA. Furthermore, this structure of a eukaryotic H/ACA RNP reveals the molecular recognition of conserved RNA and protein motifs, as well as interactions that are crucial for understanding the molecular pathology of many mutations that cause disease. Our findings provide the structural details of the assembly and active site of human telomerase, which paves the way for the development of therapeutic agents that target this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W3154306033,"The bacterial flagellar motor is a supramolecular protein machine that drives rotation of the flagellum for motility, which is essential for bacterial survival in different environments and a key determinant of pathogenicity. The detailed structure of the flagellar motor remains unknown. Here we present an atomic-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the bacterial flagellar motor complexed with the hook, consisting of 175 subunits with a molecular mass of approximately 6.3 MDa. The structure reveals that 10 peptides protruding from the MS ring with the FlgB and FliE subunits mediate torque transmission from the MS ring to the rod and overcome the symmetry mismatch between the rotational and helical structures in the motor. The LP ring contacts the distal rod and applies electrostatic forces to support its rotation and torque transmission to the hook. This work provides detailed molecular insights into the structure, assembly, and torque transmission mechanisms of the flagellar motor."
https://openalex.org/W3080344441,"Single-molecule imaging is challenging but highly beneficial for investigating intermolecular interactions at the molecular level1-6. Van der Waals interactions at the sub-nanometre scale strongly influence various molecular behaviours under confinement conditions7-11. Inspired by the traditional compass12, here we use a para-xylene molecule as a rotating pointer to detect the host-guest van der Waals interactions in the straight channel of the MFI-type zeolite framework. We use integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy13-15 to achieve real-space imaging of a single para-xylene molecule in each channel. A good correlation between the orientation of the single-molecule pointer and the atomic structure of the channel is established by combining the results of calculations and imaging studies. The orientations of para-xylene help us to identify changes in the van der Waals interactions, which are related to the channel geometry in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This work not only provides a visible and sensitive means to investigate host-guest van der Waals interactions in porous materials at the molecular level, but also encourages the further study of other single-molecule behaviours using electron microscopy techniques."

https://openalex.org/W3156025069,"Gravitational interactions between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the stellar and dark matter halo of the Milky Way are expected to give rise to disequilibrium phenomena in the outer Milky Way1-7. A local wake is predicted to trail the orbit of the LMC, and a large-scale overdensity is predicted to exist across a large area of the northern Galactic hemisphere. Here we report the detection of both the local wake and northern overdensity (hereafter the 'collective response') in a map of the Galaxy based on 1,301 stars at Galactocentric distances between 60 and 100 kiloparsecs. The location of the wake is in good agreement with an N-body simulation that includes the dynamical effect of the LMC on the Milky Way halo. The density contrast of the wake and collective response are stronger in the data than in the simulation. The detection of a strong local wake is independent evidence that the Magellanic clouds are on their first orbit around the Milky Way. The wake traces the path of the LMC, which will provide insight into the orbit of the LMC, which in turn is a sensitive probe of the mass of the LMC and the Milky Way. These data demonstrate that the outer halo is not in dynamical equilibrium, as is often assumed. The morphology and strength of the wake could be used to test the nature of dark matter and gravity."
https://openalex.org/W3153243121,"The ability to categorize sensory stimuli is crucial for an animal's survival in a complex environment. Memorizing categories instead of individual exemplars enables greater behavioural flexibility and is computationally advantageous. Neurons that show category selectivity have been found in several areas of the mammalian neocortex1-4, but the prefrontal cortex seems to have a prominent role4,5 in this context. Specifically, in primates that are extensively trained on a categorization task, neurons in the prefrontal cortex rapidly and flexibly represent learned categories6,7. However, how these representations first emerge in naive animals remains unexplored, leaving it unclear whether flexible representations are gradually built up as part of semantic memory or assigned more or less instantly during task execution8,9. Here we investigate the formation of a neuronal category representation throughout the entire learning process by repeatedly imaging individual cells in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex. We show that mice readily learn rule-based categorization and generalize to novel stimuli. Over the course of learning, neurons in the prefrontal cortex display distinct dynamics in acquiring category selectivity and are differentially engaged during a later switch in rules. A subset of neurons selectively and uniquely respond to categories and reflect generalization behaviour. Thus, a category representation in the mouse prefrontal cortex is gradually acquired during learning rather than recruited ad hoc. This gradual process suggests that neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex are part of a specific semantic memory for visual categories."
https://openalex.org/W3154595010,"Africa is forecasted to experience large and rapid climate change1 and population growth2 during the twenty-first century, which threatens the world’s second largest rainforest. Protecting and sustainably managing these African forests requires an increased understanding of their compositional heterogeneity, the environmental drivers of forest composition and their vulnerability to ongoing changes. Here, using a very large dataset of 6 million trees in more than 180,000 field plots, we jointly model the distribution in abundance of the most dominant tree taxa in central Africa, and produce continuous maps of the floristic and functional composition of central African forests. Our results show that the uncertainty in taxon-specific distributions averages out at the community level, and reveal highly deterministic assemblages. We uncover contrasting floristic and functional compositions across climates, soil types and anthropogenic gradients, with functional convergence among types of forest that are floristically dissimilar. Combining these spatial predictions with scenarios of climatic and anthropogenic global change suggests a high vulnerability of the northern and southern forest margins, the Atlantic forests and most forests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where both climate and anthropogenic threats are expected to increase sharply by 2085. These results constitute key quantitative benchmarks for scientists and policymakers to shape transnational conservation and management strategies that aim to provide a sustainable future for central African forests. A large dataset of 6 million trees from 193 taxa is used to map the floristic and functional composition of central African forests and predict their vulnerability to climate change."

At least some neoblasts are individually pluripotent. Neoblasts are also heterogeneous, with subpopulations of specialized neoblasts having different specified fates. Fate specification in neoblasts is regulated by fate-specific transcription factor (FSTF) expression. Here, we find that FSTF expression is common in neoblast S/G2/M cell-cycle phases but less common in G1. We find that specialized neoblasts can divide to produce progeny with asymmetric cell fates, suggesting that they could retain pluripotency. Furthermore, no known neoblast class was present in all neoblast colonies, suggesting that pluripotency is not the exclusive property of any known class. We tested this possibility with single-cell transplantations, which indicate that at least some specialized neoblasts are likely clonogenic.

Planarians are a classic system for studying how adult stem cells regenerate tissues (Reddien, 2018Reddien P.W. The cellular and molecular basis for planarian regeneration.Cell. 2018; 175: 327-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Adult planarian stem cells (neoblasts) are collectively pluripotent and responsible for all new cell production during regeneration and tissue turnover (Baguñá et al., 1989Baguñá J. Saló E.

The path neoblasts take from naive, through fate specified, to differentiated remains unclear (Adler and Sánchez Alvarado, 2015Adler C.E. Sánchez Alvarado A. Types or states?

Distinguishing among possible models for this path is critical to explaining pluripotency and fate specification in this stem cell population. Neoblasts are the only cycling somatic cells of planarians and can therefore be specifically ablated by irradiation (Bardeen and Baetjer, 1904Bardeen C.R. Baetjer F.H.

After transplantation into lethally irradiated hosts, some neoblasts proliferate and differentiate into all cell types of the animal; therefore, some neoblasts are individually pluripotent (Wagner et al., 2011Wagner D.E.

Neoblasts that were initially categorized as distinct from epidermal-specialized (zeta) neoblasts were called “sigma neoblasts” (van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014van Wolfswinkel J.C. Wagner D.E.

These cells encompass many non-epidermal-specialized cell classes and cells of unknown specialization states (Fincher et al., 2018Fincher C.T. Wurtzel O. de Hoog T. Kravarik K.M. Reddien P.W.

High levels of smedwi-1 transcript mark all neoblasts and essentially only neoblasts (Reddien et al., 2005bReddien P.W. Oviedo N.J. Jennings J.R. Jenkin J.C. Sánchez Alvarado A.

Clonogenic neoblasts are pluripotent adult stem cells that underlie planarian regeneration.Science. 2011; 332: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). As neoblasts exit the cell cycle, they stop expressing smedwi-1 and other canonical neoblast markers and activate expression of genes associated with distinct differentiation trajectories. As indicated by BrdU incorporation experiments, smedwi-1-negative cells are not known to re-enter the cell cycle (i.e., are post-mitotic rather than quiescent) (Wagner et al., 2011Wagner D.E. Wang I.E. Reddien P.W. Clonogenic neoblasts are pluripotent adult stem cells that underlie planarian regeneration.Science. 2011; 332: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Most study of specialized neoblasts has involved neoblasts in the G2/M cell-cycle stages for practical reasons: G2/M neoblasts can be purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for 4C cells (Hayashi et al., 2006Hayashi T. Asami M. Higuchi S. Shibata N. Agata K. Isolation of planarian X-ray-sensitive stem cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.Dev. Growth Differ. 2006; 48: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Prior work on epidermis-specialized zeta neoblasts comparing 2C (G1) and 4C (G2/M) states indicated that epidermal specialization occurs during S phase and does not involve subsequent divisions in a specialized state (van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014van Wolfswinkel J.C.

Single-cell analysis reveals functionally distinct classes within the planarian stem cell compartment.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 326-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The zeta-neoblast signature, including epidermal FSTF transcripts, is not robustly present in G1 but emerges as the cell cycle progresses (van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014van Wolfswinkel J.C. Wagner D.E. Reddien P.W. Single-cell analysis reveals functionally distinct classes within the planarian stem cell compartment.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 326-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We find that neoblasts robustly express FSTFs in S/G2/M phases, with less FSTF expression in G1. A specialized neoblast division can produce asymmetric outcomes: one fate-specified, post-mitotic daughter and a neoblast lacking signature of that specialized state. We propose a non-hierarchical lineage model for neoblasts, in which a neoblast can specify one of a diverse set of possible fates in the course of a single division and specialized neoblasts can divide to generate neoblasts that can specify different fates. Similar models could apply in multiple adult stem cell contexts to allow rapid production of differentiated cells without requiring a large division hierarchy. To examine neoblast fate specification and differentiation across the cell cycle, we first used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. A scRNA-seq atlas (Fincher et al., 2018Fincher C.T.

G1 cells (cells that will divide again) and G0 cells (cells that will exit the cell cycle and differentiate) were not distinguished from each other (Fincher et al., 2018Fincher C.T.

We sought to use known neoblast and differentiation hallmarks to classify presumptive G1 or G0 cells in scRNA-seq data. Whereas all neoblasts display high transcript levels for canonical neoblast markers (e.g., smedwi-1), newly produced G0 cells lowly express these markers (Fincher et al., 2018Fincher C.T.

As cells enter G0 and differentiate, they upregulate transcripts associated with cell-type-specific differentiation (Eisenhoffer et al., 2008Eisenhoffer G.T. Kang H. Sánchez Alvarado A.

More than 12,000 cells categorized as G1 or G0 that expressed smedwi-1 above a low minimal threshold were analyzed by clustering with highly variant genes among these cells (Figures 1B and S1B; STAR Methods). One cluster (cluster 1) consistently and highly expressed canonical neoblast genes (e.g., smedwi-1, bruli, and vasa1), and some cluster 1 cells expressed genes encoding replication machinery (e.g., mcm7, mcm5, pcna) (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1B). We thus hypothesized that cluster 1 was comprised largely of G1 neoblasts. Cluster 2–7 cells expressed neoblast markers lowly and infrequently (Figures 1B and 1C). Each of clusters 2–7 expressed hallmarks of differentiation toward different cell fates: cluster 2, epidermis; cluster 3, neurons; cluster 4, muscle; cluster 5, protonephridia; cluster 6, cathepsin+ phagocytes; and cluster 7, intestine (Figure 1D). We therefore hypothesized that clusters 2–7 were comprised largely of fate-specified post-mitotic G0 cells. Differential gene expression analysis comparing cluster 1 with clusters 2–7 identified 130 genes with enriched expression in clusters 2–7, including known tissue-specific post-mitotic markers (e.g., prog-1 for epidermis) (Table S1). Some of these genes were expressed commonly in clusters 2–7, including the top three genes in this cohort: XBP1, calreticulin, and P4HB (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S1). These genes encode proteins that mediate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein folding. ER size has previously been used to identify differentiating cells, including in planarians (Hay and Coward, 1975Hay E.D. Coward S.J. Fine structure studies on the planarian, Dugesia. I.

Enriched expression of these genes in smedwi-1-low cells is therefore consistent with the possibility that they are post-mitotic G0 cells. The neural-associated cluster 3 had less overall expression of P4HB and XBP1 compared with other differentiated tissue clusters but still displayed enriched expression of neural-specific post-mitotic markers (e.g., synaptotagmin), suggesting that many to most of these cells are post-mitotic neural cells (Figures 1C and 1D). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated expression of P4HB in the majority of known post-mitotic cells (e.g., 63% of prog-1+ epidermal progenitors and 75% of dd_554+ pharynx progenitors were also P4HB+), but P4HB was largely excluded from smedwi-1-high neoblasts (1.8% were also P4HB+) (Figure S1C). P4HB was also expressed in smedwi-1− cells in the total scRNA-seq dataset (Figure S1D). Overall, expression of ER-associated genes in smedwi-1-low cells supports the conclusion that the smedwi-1-low cells of clusters 2–7 are post-mitotic. From prior work on epidermis-specialized zeta neoblasts (van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014van Wolfswinkel J.C. Wagner D.E. Reddien P.W. Single-cell analysis reveals functionally distinct classes within the planarian stem cell compartment.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 326-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that neoblast specialization for multiple fates could begin in S phase. One prediction of this hypothesis is that FSTF expression should be rarer in G1 neoblasts, with more robust FSTF expression as neoblasts specialize in S phase. FSTFs, like cell-type-specific post-mitotic markers, were expressed in a cluster-specific manner in G0-annotated cells (Figure 1D). By contrast, G1-annotated cells expressed FSTFs and cell class markers less frequently, suggesting that they could be less frequently specialized than G0 cells (Figures 1D and 1E). G1-annotated neoblasts also less frequently expressed FSTFs than did S, G2, or M phase-annotated neoblasts (Figures 1E and S1E). G1-annotated neoblasts robustly expressed neoblast markers (including general neoblast transcription factors) at equivalent frequencies to neoblasts in other stages and had approximately the same median total unique molecular identifier (UMI) count as G2/M-annotated neoblasts (Figures 1E and S1F). The difference in FSTF expression between G1-annotated and S/G2/M-annotated neoblasts is therefore unlikely because of global transcription-level differences. FSTFs involved in specifying the same cell type are frequently co-expressed in neoblasts (Reddien, 2018Reddien P.W. The cellular and molecular basis for planarian regeneration.Cell. 2018; 175: 327-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); this phenomenon was recapitulated in the scRNA-seq data in S/G2/M-annotated neoblasts (Figures S1G–S1I). By contrast, FSTFs associated with the same fate displayed weaker correlation in expression among those G1-annotated neoblasts that expressed them, suggesting a weaker fate signature (Figures S1G–S1I). Furthermore, pairwise correlation analysis between the top ten defining genes of differentiated neuron, epidermal, muscle, and intestine cells in the Fincher et al., 2018Fincher C.T. Wurtzel O. de Hoog T. Kravarik K.M. Reddien P.W. Cell type transcriptome atlas for the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea.Science. 2018; 360: 1-19Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar scRNA-seq dataset (Table S2) showed that genes marking the same fate displayed significantly higher correlation of expression in S/G2/M-annotated neoblasts than in G1-annotated neoblasts (Figure 1F). Overall, compared with neoblasts annotated to be in other cell-cycle stages, G1-annotated neoblasts showed less expression of FSTFs and a weaker overall cell-type-specific signature, suggesting that many G1 neoblasts are less specialized than neoblasts in other stages. We also assessed hallmarks of fate specification and differentiation across the cell cycle using FACS-based DNA quantitation (Hayashi et al., 2006Hayashi T. Asami M. Higuchi S. Shibata N. Agata K. Isolation of planarian X-ray-sensitive stem cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.Dev. Growth Differ. 2006; 48: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar; Ogawa et al., 2002Ogawa K.

Growth Differ. 2002; 44: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). G2/M-phase neoblasts with 4C DNA content, S-phase neoblasts with intermediate DNA content, and G1-phase neoblasts and G0 post-mitotic progeny with 2C DNA content were collected on the basis of Hoechst labeling of DNA and FACS (Figure S2A). Cell-cycle stage-specific markers were enriched in expression in their corresponding gates (Figure S2B). First, we subjected sorted cells from the 2C G1/G0 gate to scRNA-seq using the 10X Genomics platform (Figure S2C). Approximately 3,000 smedwi-1+ cells were interpreted to represent G1 neoblasts and early G0 post-mitotic cells; these cells were clustered on the basis of highly expressed and variable genes (Figure 1G; STAR Methods). One cluster (cluster 1) was comprised of cells that highly expressed neoblast markers and lowly expressed post-mitotic markers, consistent with this cluster being composed largely of G1 neoblasts (Figures 1G and 1H). The remaining clusters (clusters 2–9) were comprised primarily of cells that expressed neoblast markers lowly and strongly expressed post-mitotic markers (Figure 1H). On a population level, cluster 1 expressed FSTFs at lower frequency than did cells of other clusters (Figures 1I, S2D, and S2E). Some cells in clusters 2–9 expressed smedwi-1 highly and displayed lower P4HB and XBP1 expression, especially at the cluster edges, possibly representing specialized G1 cells and/or transition states to differentiation (Figure 1H). The neural-annotated cluster (cluster 2) contained cells that were generally lower in P4HB and higher in smedwi-1 than the cells of clusters 3–9, consistent with cell type differences in differentiation and specification dynamics (Figures 1C, 1H, and 1J). Similar observations were made through visualizing cell relationships using dimension reduction via the UMAP (uniform manifold approximation and projection) algorithm rather than tSNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) (Figures 1J, S2F, and S2G). Next, we used FISH to assess smedwi-1, P4HB, and FSTF expression in cells isolated by FACS. smedwi-1+ > 2C, < 4C DNA content cells were annotated as S-phase neoblasts, and smedwi-1+ 4C cells were annotated as G2/M-phase neoblasts. Within the 2C gate, smedwi-1-high, P4HB− cells were annotated as G1 neoblasts, whereas smedwi-1-low/negative, P4HB+ cells were annotated as post-mitotic G0 progeny. Expression of 17 well-characterized FSTFs, representing specification to broad fates, was assessed in >3,000 cells each. Because FISH lacks quantitative expression-level resolution, categorization of FSTF positive/negative expression was performed by setting visual thresholds blind to smedwi-1 and P4HB expression levels, which were called independently. In every case, the tested FSTF was more frequently expressed in S and G2/M neoblasts and in G0 cells than in G1 neoblasts (Figures 2A, 2C, and S2H). For example, epidermal FSTF zfp-1 was expressed in 9% of G1-annotated neoblasts and 31%–32% of S/G2/M-annotated neoblasts. Similarly, hnf4 was expressed in 4% of G1-annotated neoblasts and 17% of S/G2/M-annotated neoblasts, and pax6A was expressed in 1% of G1-annotated neoblasts and 5%–6% of S/G2/M-annotated neoblasts (Figure 2A). We also assayed soxP-2 and znf333, which are expressed in neoblasts but not known to be associated with any particular cell-type fate. Consistent with prior data suggesting that soxP-2 is expressed throughout the cell cycle (Lai et al., 2018Lai A.G. Kosaka N. Abnave P. Sahu S. Aboobaker A.A.

Single-cell analysis reveals functionally distinct classes within the planarian stem cell compartment.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 326-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), soxP-2 and znf333 transcripts were present with approximately equal frequency in neoblasts of all cell-cycle stages (13%–16% of neoblasts expressed soxP-2 and 17%–19% expressed znf333) and were infrequently present in G0 cells (8% of G0 cells expressed soxP-2 and 2% expressed znf333) (Figures 2B and 2C). This suggests that FSTF expression, rather than transcription factor expression in general, was less frequent in G1 neoblasts. If many neoblasts become specialized around the onset of DNA replication, neoblasts in early S might have less frequent FSTF expression than neoblasts in late S. This was previously shown to be the case for zfp-1 (van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014van Wolfswinkel J.C. Wagner D.E. Reddien P.W. Single-cell analysis reveals functionally distinct classes within the planarian stem cell compartment.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 326-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and was also observed here (Figure S2I). smedwi-1+; FSTF+ cells present in the 2C FACS gate could include fate-specified G1 neoblasts and/or transition states as cells initiate differentiation or division. We noted that many of the smedwi-1+; FSTF+ 2C FACS-gated cells had large nuclei, similar to S-phase nuclei but significantly different from the average nucleus size of other 2C cells (p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) (Figure S2J). We hypothesized that such cells might represent S-phase neoblasts within the 2C FACS gate. We labeled cells undergoing DNA replication with a 12 h pulse of F-ara-EdU. Cells that incorporated F-ara-EdU had roughly equivalent Hoechst labeling as did other cells (Figure S2K). Following the pulse, many S-phase cells (67%), but almost no P4HB+ G0 cells (0.5%), were F-ara-EdU+, suggesting that cells did not incorporate F-ara-EdU to detectable levels and subsequently divide and reach the measurable G0 state in this time period (Figures S2L and S2M). Roughly half of the smedwi-1+; FSTF+ cells in the 2C gate were F-ara-EdU+ (e.g., 17 of 34 zfp-1+ cells and 105 of 206 FSTF+ cells summed across 10 FSTFs were F-ara-EdU+) (Figure 2D). Furthermore, labeling appeared incomplete: only 67% of S phase cells were F-ara-EdU+ (Figure S2M)."

While such data are essential, public health restrictions provide clear signals of what is socially desirable in this context, creating a potential source of response bias in self-reported measures of compliance. In this research, we examine whether the results of a guilt-free strategy recently proposed to lessen this constraint are generalizable across twelve countries, and whether the treatment effect varies across subgroups. Our findings show that the guilt-free strategy is a useful tool in every country included, increasing respondents’ proclivity to report non-compliance by 9 to 16 percentage points. This effect holds for different subgroups based on gender, age and education. We conclude that the inclusion of this strategy should be the new standard for survey research that aims to provide crucial data on the current pandemic."

The high node mobility and sparse vehicle distribution (on the road) compromise VANETs network scalability and rapid topology, hence creating major challenges, such as network physical layout formation, unstable links to enable robust, reliable, and scalable vehicle communication, especially in a dense traffic network. This study discusses a novel optimization approach considering transmission range, node density, speed, direction, and grid size during clustering. Whale Optimization Algorithm for Clustering in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (WOACNET) was introduced to select an optimum cluster head (CH) and was calculated and evaluated based on intelligence and capability. Initially, simulations were performed, Subsequently, rigorous experimentations were conducted on WOACNET. The model was compared and evaluated with state-of-the-art well-established other methods, such as Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) employing various performance metrics. The results demonstrate that the developed method performance is well ahead compared to other methods in VANET in terms of cluster head, varying transmission ranges, grid size, and nodes. The developed method results in achieving an overall 46% enhancement in cluster optimization and an F-value of 31.64 compared to other established methods (11.95 and 22.50) consequently, increase in cluster lifetime."

In this study, we reported the identification of LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) as a promoter of gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis, and its potential to be a therapeutic target of dabrafenib (DAB). Using transcriptomic sequencing of paired gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis, primary tumors, and normal gastric tissues, we first unveiled that LIMK1 is selectively up-regulated in metastatic tumors. Increased LIMK1 in gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis was validated by immunohistochemistry analysis of an independent patient cohort. In vitro functional studies demonstrated that LIMK1 knockout or knockdown significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. LIMK1 knockout also abrogated peritoneal and liver metastases of gastric cancer cells in nude mice in vivo. Dabrafenib, a small molecule targeting LIMK1, was found to decrease cell migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells in vitro and abolish peritoneal and liver metastasis formation in vivo. Mechanistically, either LIMK1 knockout or Dabrafenib inhibited LIMK1 expression and phosphorylation of its downstream target cofilin. Taken together, our results demonstrated that LIMK1 functions as a metastasis promoter in gastric cancer by inhibiting LIMK1-p-cofilin and that Dabrafenib has the potential to serve as a novel treatment for gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis."

Overall, LP prevalence in 2004-2018 was 44.6%. Risk factors for LP included older age, having been infected through injection drug use or heterosexual intercourse, low educational level and originating from non-European countries. LP was associated with an increased risk of the composite endpoint (IRR: 1.34; 95%CI 1.20, 1.50), ADE (1.39; 1.18, 1.64), SNAE (1.22; 1.01, 1.47) and mortality (1.71; 1.41, 2.08).LP remains a health problem in Spain, mainly among certain populations, and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality.

https://openalex.org/W3153742863,"Columnar metaplasia of the esophagus is the main risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. There is a lack of evidence to demonstrate that esophageal progenitors can be the source of columnar metaplasia. In this study, using transgenic mouse models, lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling, we found that the activation of the Hedgehog pathway in esophageal cells modifies their differentiation status in vivo. This process involves an initial step of dedifferentiation into embryonic-like esophageal progenitors. Moreover, a subset of these cells undergoes full squamous-to-columnar conversion and expresses selected intestinal markers. These modifications of cell fate are associated with remodeling of the chromatin and the appearance of Sox9. Using a conditional knockout mouse, we show that Sox9 is required for columnar conversion but not for the step of dedifferentiation. These results provide insight into the mechanisms by which esophageal cells might initiate columnar metaplasia."

Structural equation modelling was used to assess the relationship between locus of control, coping mechanisms, health anxiety and age. Age related differences in both locus of control and coping strategies were found. Younger people experienced more health-related anxiety and were more likely to engage with social media as a coping mechanism.

The cut-off value of viral load for presence of pneumonia was also investigated. The mean age was 28.0±9.3 years. Eleven patients (10.4%) experienced viral remission within one week of diagnosis, but one (0.9%) transferred to the hospital due to aggravation of pneumonia. Patients with pneumonia had significantly higher viral load than those without, and the cut-off value of the Ct value for presence of pneumonia were 31.38. The patients with pneumonia had significantly slower recovery times than those without. Diarrhea was significantly more common in patients with pneumonia than patients without pneumonia. In conclusion, most young asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients showed stable clinical course.

https://openalex.org/W3156691384,"Introduction Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is linked to low engagement with HIV management services and adverse clinical outcomes, including poor ART adherence. In sub-Saharan Africa, studies on pregnant/postpartum women and transactional sex workers have produced divergent evidence regarding IPV’s association with poor ART adherence. We investigate this association among a broad group of women. Methods We sampled 408 HIV-positive women receiving free ART from different types of HIV clinics at government health facilities, assessing for IPV exposure by a current partner, ART adherence rate, and other factors that affect ART adherence (e.g. education, disclosure). ART adherence rates were measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); responses were dichotomised at a ≥95% cut-off. Multiple logistic regression models assessed the association between the independent variables and ART adherence. Results The participants’ mean age was 38.6 (range: 18–69 years). The majority had ever attended school (94%, n = 382), were in monogamous marriages (70%, n = 282), and had disclosed status to partners (94%, n = 380). Overall, 60% ( n = 242) reported optimal ART adherence (≥ 95%) in the previous 30 days. The prevalence of IPV by the current partner was 76% ( CI95 = 72–80%). Experiencing physical IPV (AOR 0.57, CI95 : 0.34–0.94, p = .028), sexual IPV (AOR 0.50, CI95 : 0.31–0.82, p = .005), or controlling behaviour (AOR 0.56, CI95 : 0.34–0.94, p = .027) reduced the odds of achieving optimal adherence, while a higher education level and having an HIV-positive partner increased the odds. Conclusion IPV is common and is associated with suboptimal ART adherence rates among a broad group of HIV-positive women. ART programs could consider incorporating basic IPV interventions into regular clinic services to identify, monitor and support exposed women, as they might be at risk of poor ART adherence. Still, there is need for more research on how IPV affects ART adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3152815656,"The weak interlayer in a rock slope often plays a significant role in seismic rockslides; however, the effect of weak interlayer on the seismic slope response and damage process is still not fully understood. This study presents a series of shaking test tests on two model slopes containing a horizontal weak interlayer with different thicknesses. A recorded Wenchuan earthquake ground motion was scaled to excite the slopes. Measurements from accelerometers embedded at different elevations of slope surface and slope interior were analyzed and compared. The effect of the weak interlayer thickness on the seismic response was highlighted by a comparative analysis of the two slopes in terms of topographic amplification, peak accelerations, and deformation characteristics as the input amplitude increased. It was found that the structure deterioration and nonlinear response of the slopes were manifested as a time lag of the horizontal accelerations in the upper slope relative to the lower slope and a reduction of resonant frequency and Fourier spectral ratio. Test results show that under horizontal acceleration, both slopes exhibited significant topographic amplification in the upper half, and the difference in amplification between slope face and slope interior was more pronounced in Slope B (with a thin weak interlayer) than in Slope A (with a thick weak interlayer). A four-phased dynamic response process of both slopes was observed. Similar deformation characteristics including development of strong response zone and macro-cracks, vertical settlement, horizontal extrusion and collapse in the upper half were observed in both slopes as the input amplitude increased; however, the deformations were more severe in Slope B than in Slope A, suggesting an energy isolation effect of the thick interlayer in Slope A."

Shedding light on the dynamics of human mobility in this region requires an in depth understanding of the local archaeological contexts across time. In this study, we present new archaeological human data from the Late Bronze Age Simris II site, located in an area of Scania showing a dynamic environment throughout the Late Bronze Age, thus likely involving various forms of mobility. Because the characterization of solid strontium isotope baselines is vital for delineating human mobility in prehistory using the strontium isotope methodology, we introduce the first environmentally based multi-proxy (surface water-, plant- and soil leachates) strontium isotope baselines for sub-regions of Scania. Our results show, that the highly complex and spatially scattered lithologies characterising Scania does not allow for a spatially meaningful, geology-based grouping of multi-proxy data that could be beneficial for provenance studies. Instead, we propose sub-regional baselines for areas that don’t necessarily fully correspond and reflect the immediate distribution of bedrock lithologies. Rather than working with a Scania-wide multi-proxy baseline, which we define as 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0.7133 ± 0.0059 (n = 102, 2σ), we propose sub-regional, multi-proxy baselines as follows: Area 1, farthest to the north, by 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0.7184 ± 0.0061 (n = 16, 2σ); Area 2, comprising the mid and western part of Scania, with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0.7140 ± 0.0043 (n = 48, 2σ); Area 3–4, roughly corresponding to a NW-SE trending zone dominated by horst-graben tectonics across Scania, plus the carbonate dominated south western part of Scania with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0.7110 ± 0.0030 (n = 39, 2σ). Our results also reflect that the complexity of the geology of Scania requires systematic, high density, statistically sound sampling of multiple proxies to adequately constrain the baseline ranges, particularly of those areas dominated by Precambrian lithologies. The averaging effect of biosphere Sr in surface water might be beneficial for the characterization of baselines in such terranes. Our sub-regional, area-specific baselines allow for a first comparison of different baseline construction strategies (single-proxy versus multi-proxy; Scania-wide versus sub-regional). From the Late Bronze Age Simris II site, we identified six individuals that could be analysed for Sr isotopes, to allow for an interpretation of their provenance using the newly established, environmental strontium isotope baselines. All but one signature agrees with the local baselines, including the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr value we measured for a young individual buried in a house urn, typically interpreted as evidence for long distance contacts. The results are somewhat unexpected and provides new aspects into the complexity of Scandinavian Bronze Age societies."
https://openalex.org/W3156463999,"The European sea bass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) exhibits female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) early in development. New tagging techniques provide the opportunity to monitor individual sex-related growth during the post-larval and juvenile stages. We produced an experimental population through artificial fertilization and followed a rearing-temperature protocol (~16°C from hatching to 112 days post-hatching, dph; ~20°C from 117 to 358 dph) targeting a roughly balanced sex ratio. The fish were tagged with microchips between 61 and 96 dph in five tagging trials of 50 fish each; individual standard length (SL) was recorded through repeated biometric measurements performed between 83 to 110 dph via image analyses. Body weight (BW) was modelled using the traits measured on the digital pictures (i.e. area, perimeter and volume). At 117 dph, the fish were tagged with microtags and regularly measured for SL and BW until 335 dph. The experiment ended at 358 dph with the sexing of the fish. The sex-ratio at the end of the experiment was significantly in favor of the females (65.6% vs. 34.4%). The females were significantly longer and heavier than the males from 103 dph (~30 mm SL, ~0.44 g BW) to 165 dph, but the modeling of the growth curves suggests that differences in size already existed at 83 dph. A significant difference in the daily growth coefficient (DGC) was observed only between 96 and 103 dph, suggesting a physiological or biological change occurring during this period. The female-biased SSD pattern in European sea bass is thus strongly influenced by very early growth differences between sexes, as already shown in previous studies, and in any case long before gonadal sex differentiation has been started, and thus probably before sex has been determined. This leads to the hypothesis that early growth might be a cause rather than a consequence of sex differentiation in sea bass."
https://openalex.org/W3154940998,"Background The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing steadily at an alarming rate. Ethiopia is placed fourth among the top five countries of the African region members of the international diabetes federation. This study aimed to determine the level of diabetes self-care practice and associated factors among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending public hospitals of the Tigray region. Methods An institution-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in six selected hospitals of Tigray region from January to February 2020. Study participants were recruited using a systematic random sampling method. Diabetes self-care practice was assessed using Summary Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) assessment tool. The data were collected by trained nurses via face-to-face interview. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with self-care practices. Statistical significance was declared at p-value &lt; 0.05. Results A total of 570 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in this study. The mean (SD) age of the participant was 46 (±14.6) years. Less than half (46.7%) of the participants had good diabetes self-care practices. Surprisingly, only 68 (11.9%) of the participants had access to a personal glucometer. Urban residency (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.20–2.94), age group 48–63 years (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.19–3.98), not having a formal education (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.32–5.25), having family support (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.24–2.85), and having a personal glucometer at home (AOR = 6.1, 95% CI = 2.83–13.0) were the factors associated with good diabetes self-care practices. Conclusion The diabetes self-care practice in the region was found to be poor. Where factors like, being an urban resident, age group between 49–63 years, not having a formal education, and having a personal glucometer at home were associated with good self-care practices. Health care providers might have to consider actions to act on the identified factors and improve the level of self-care practices of the patients."
https://openalex.org/W3155009410,"Retinal inflammation accelerates photoreceptor cell death caused by retinal degeneration. Minocycline, a semisynthetic broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic, has been previously reported to rescue photoreceptor cell death in retinal degeneration. We examined the effect of minocycline on retinal photoreceptor degeneration using c-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase ( Mertk) −/− Cx3cr1 GFP/+ Ccr2 RFP/+ mice, which enabled the observation of CX3CR1-green fluorescent protein (GFP)- and CCR2-red fluorescent protein (RFP)-positive macrophages by fluorescence. Retinas of Mertk −/− Cx3cr1 GFP/+ Ccr2 RFP/+ mice showed photoreceptor degeneration and accumulation of GFP- and RFP-positive macrophages in the outer retina and subretinal space at 6 weeks of age. Mertk −/− Cx3cr1 GFP/+ Ccr2 RFP/+ mice were intraperitoneally administered minocycline. The number of CCR2-RFP positive cells significantly decreased after minocycline treatment. Furthermore, minocycline administration resulted in partial reversal of the thinning of the outer nuclear layer and decreased the number of apoptotic cells, as assessed by the TUNEL assay, in Mertk −/− Cx3cr1 GFP/+ Ccr2 RFP/+ mice. In conclusion, we found that minocycline ameliorated photoreceptor cell death in an inherited photoreceptor degeneration model due to Mertk gene deficiency and has an inhibitory effect on CCR2 positive macrophages, which is likely to be a neuroprotective mechanism of minocycline."
https://openalex.org/W3156428868,"Purpose This single-center study compared three threshold settings for automated analysis of the ischemic core (IC) and penumbral volumes using computed tomographic perfusion, and their accuracy for predicting final infarct volume (FIV) in patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods Fifty-two consecutive AIS patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy (November 2015–March 2018) were included. Perfusion images were retrospectively analyzed using a single CT Neuro perfusion application (syngo.via 4.1, Siemens Healthcare GmbH). Three threshold values (S1–S3) were derived from another commercial package (RAPID; iSchema View) (S1), up-to-date syngo.via default values (S2), and adapted values for syngo.via from a reference study (S3). The results were compared with FIV determined by non-contrast CT. Results The median IC volume (mL) was 24.6 (interquartile range: 13.7–58.1) with S1 and 30.1 (20.1–53.1) with S2/S3. After removing the contralateral hemisphere from the analysis, the median IC volume decreased by 1.33(0–3.14) with S1 versus 9.13 (6.24–14.82) with S2/S3. The median penumbral volume (mL) was 74.52 (49.64–131.91), 77.86 (46.56–99.23), and 173.23 (125.86–200.64) for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. Limiting analysis to the affected hemisphere, the penumbral volume decreased by 1.6 (0.13–9.02), 19.29 (12.59–26.52), and 58.33 mL (45.53–74.84) for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. The correlation between IC and FIV was highest in patients with successful recanalization (n = 34, r = 0.784 for S1; r = 0.797 for S2/S3). Conclusion Optimizing thresholds significantly improves the accuracy of estimated IC and penumbral volumes. Current recommended values produce diversified results. International guidelines based on larger multicenter studies should be established to support the standardization of volumetric analysis in clinical decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3152881905,"This paper draws on data from five sub-Sahara African countries; Uganda, Rwanda, Malawi, Zambia, and Mozambique consisting of 10,041 married women who were cohabitating with a male spouse. The study aim was to investigate the relationship between women’s empowerment and women’s dietary diversity and consumption of different food items. Women’s empowerment was measured using the indicators in the five domains of Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture index (WEAI) and women’s dietary diversity and food consumption was examined using the women’s dietary diversity score (WDDS) measure. OLS and LPM regressions were used and analyses were confirmed using marginal effects from Poisson and logistic regressions. Results suggest that three out of the 10 WEAI indicators of empowerment showed different magnitude and direction in significant associations with improved WDDS and varied associations were found in three out of the five countries examined. In addition, the three significant empowerment indicators were associated with the consumption of different food groups in three out of the five countries examined suggesting that diverse food groups account for the association between the WEAI and WDDS. Improved autonomy, and input in production were associated with improved likelihoods of consumption of dairy products, and fruits and vegetables including vitamin A-rich produce. Empowerment in public speaking was associated with improved consumption of other fruits and vegetables including vitamin A-rich produce. The varied nature of empowerment indicators towards improving women’s dietary diversity and food consumption suggests that different empowerment strategies might confer different benefits towards the consumption of different food groups. Further, findings imply that interventions that seek to empower women should tailor their strategies on existing contextual factors that impact on women"
https://openalex.org/W3153025214,"Background Dietary behavior and nutrient intake patterns among U.S. men and women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are unclear at the population level. Methods This cross-sectional study compared dietary intake patterns among U.S. adults (aged ≥18 years) with and without IBD in the 2015 National Health Interview Survey (N = 33,626). Age-standardized weighted prevalences for intake of fruits, vegetables, dairy, whole grain bread, dietary fiber, calcium, total added sugars, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), processed meat, and supplement use were compared between adults with and without IBD by sex. Results In 2015, an estimated 3 million adults (1.3%) reported IBD. Compared with adults without IBD, adults with IBD were more likely to be older, non-Hispanic white, not currently working, former smokers, and former alcohol drinkers. Overall, dietary behaviors were similar among adults with and without IBD. However, adults with IBD were more likely to take vitamin D supplements (31.5% vs 18.8%) and consume dietary fiber &lt;16.7 grams(g)/day, the amount that 50% of U.S. adults consumed (51.8% vs 44.1%), than those without IBD. Compared with their counterparts, men with IBD were more likely to consume vegetables ≥1 time/day (84.9% vs 76.0%) and take any supplement (59.6% vs 46.0%); women with IBD were more likely to have SSBs ≥2 times/day (26.8% vs 17.8%) and total added sugars ≥14.6 teaspoons(tsp)/day, the amount that 50% of U.S. adults consumed (55.3% vs 46.7%). Conclusions Adopting a healthy diet, especially limiting added sugars intake among women with IBD, might be important for the overall health."
https://openalex.org/W3152998013,"With the aim of studying the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Tuscany region of Italy during the first epidemic wave (February-June 2020), we define a compartmental model that accounts for both detected and undetected infections and assumes that only notified cases can die. We estimate the infection fatality rate, the case fatality rate, and the basic reproduction number, modeled as a time-varying function, by calibrating on the cumulative daily number of observed deaths and notified infected, after fixing to plausible values the other model parameters to assure identifiability. The confidence intervals are estimated by a parametric bootstrap procedure and a Global Sensitivity Analysis is performed to assess the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in the values of the fixed parameters. According to our results, the basic reproduction number drops from an initial value of 6.055 to 0 at the end of the national lockdown, then it grows again, but remaining under 1. At the beginning of the epidemic, the case and the infection fatality rates are estimated to be 13.1% and 2.3%, respectively. Among the parameters considered as fixed, the average time from infection to recovery for the not notified infected appears to be the most impacting one on the model estimates. The probability for an infected to be notified has a relevant impact on the infection fatality rate and on the shape of the epidemic curve. This stresses the need of collecting information on these parameters to better understand the phenomenon and get reliable predictions."
https://openalex.org/W3156252600,"Correct identification of triatomine bugs is crucial for Chagas disease surveillance, yet available taxonomic keys are outdated, incomplete, or both. Here we present TriatoDex , an Android app-based pictorial, annotated, polytomous key to the Triatominae. TriatoDex was developed using Android Studio and tested by 27 Brazilian users. Each user received a box with pinned, number-labeled, adult triatomines (33 species in total) and was asked to identify each bug to the species level. We used generalized linear mixed models (with user- and species-ID random effects) and information-theoretic model evaluation/averaging to investigate TriatoDex performance. TriatoDex encompasses 79 questions and 554 images of the 150 triatomine-bug species described worldwide up to 2017. TriatoDex -based identification was correct in 78.9% of 824 tasks. TriatoDex performed better in the hands of trained taxonomists (93.3% vs . 72.7% correct identifications; model-averaged, adjusted odds ratio 5.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.09–11.48). In contrast, user age, gender, primary job (including academic research/teaching or disease surveillance), workplace (including universities, a reference laboratory for triatomine-bug taxonomy, or disease-surveillance units), and basic training (from high school to biology) all had negligible effects on TriatoDex performance. Our analyses also suggest that, as TriatoDex results accrue to cover more taxa, they may help pinpoint triatomine-bug species that are consistently harder (than average) to identify. In a pilot comparison with a standard, printed key (370 tasks by seven users), TriatoDex performed similarly (84.5% correct assignments, CI 68.9–94.0%), but identification was 32.8% (CI 24.7–40.1%) faster on average–for a mean absolute saving of ~2.3 minutes per bug-identification task. TriatoDex holds much promise as a handy, flexible, and reliable tool for triatomine-bug identification; an updated iOS/Android version is under development. We expect that, with continuous refinement derived from evolving knowledge and user feedback, TriatoDex will substantially help strengthen both entomological surveillance and research on Chagas disease vectors."
https://openalex.org/W3153923140,"Aim To describe the patterns of discontinuation and reinitiation in new users of metformin monotherapy in New Zealand, overall and according to person- and healthcare-related factors. Materials and methods We created a cohort (n = 85,066) of all patients in New Zealand with type 2 diabetes mellitus who initiated metformin monotherapy between 1 January 2006 and 30 September 2014 from the national data collections, and followed them until the earlier of their death or 31 December 2015. Discontinuation was defined as a gap in possession of metformin monotherapy of ≥90 days. We explored patterns of discontinuation and reinitiation using competing risks methods. Results After 1 year of follow-up, 28% of cohort members had discontinued metformin monotherapy at least once; the corresponding figures after 2 and 5 years were 37% and 46%. The proportions who reinitiated metformin monotherapy within 1, 2, and 5 years of their first discontinuation were 23%, 49%, and 73%. Discontinuation after the first reinitiation was common (48% after 1 year). Discontinuation and reinitiation varied by age, ethnicity, and other person- and healthcare-related factors. Discussion Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of metformin monotherapy use, show that substantial periods of non-use are common, and identify priority populations for interventions to facilitate adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3154606977,"Interaction of iron responsive elements (IRE) mRNA with the translational machinery is an early step critical in the initiation of protein synthesis. To investigate the binding specificity of IRE mRNA for eIF4F, kinetic rates for the eIF4F·IRE RNA interactions were determined and correlated with the translational efficiency. The observed rate of eIF4F·FRT IRE RNA interactions was 2-fold greater as compared to eIF4F·ACO2 IRE RNA binding. Addition of iron enhanced the association rates and lowered the dissociation rates for the eIF4F binding to both IRE RNAs, with having higher preferential binding to the FRT IRE RNA. The binding rates of both eIF4F·IRE RNA complexes correlated with the enhancement of protein synthesis in vitro . Presence of iron and eIF4F in the depleted WGE significantly enhanced translation for both IRE RNAs. This suggests that iron promotes translation by enhancing the binding rates of the eIF4F∙IRE RNA complex. eIF4F·IRE RNA binding is temperature-dependent; raising the temperature from 5 to 25°C, enhanced the binding rates of eIF4F·FRT IRE (4-fold) and eIF4F·ACO2 IRE (5-fold). Presence of Fe 2+ caused reduction in the activation energy for the binding of FRT IRE and ACO2 IRE to eIF4F, suggesting a more stable platform for initiating protein synthesis. In the presence of iron, lowered energy barrier has leads to the faster association rate and slower rate of dissociation for the protein-RNA complex, thus favoring efficient protein synthesis. Our results correlate well with the observed translational efficiency of IRE RNA, thereby suggesting that the presence of iron leads to a rapid, favorable, and stable complex formation that directs regulatory system to respond efficiently to cellular iron levels."
https://openalex.org/W3155170479,"Purpose To describe nurse anesthetists’ experiences using smart glasses to monitor patients’ vital signs during anesthesia care. Methods Data was collected through individual semi-structured interviews with seven nurse anesthetists who had used smart glasses, with a customized application for monitoring vital signs, during clinical anesthesia care. Data was analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results An overarching theme became evident during analysis; Facing and embracing responsibility . Being a nurse anesthetist entails a great responsibility, and the participants demonstrated that they shouldered this responsibility with pride. The theme was divided in two sub-themes. The first of these, A new way of working , comprised the categories Adoption and Utility . This involved incorporating smart glasses into existing routines in order to provide safe anesthesia care. The second sub-theme, Encountering side effects , consisted of the categories Obstacles and Personal affect . This sub-theme concerned the possibility to use smart glasses as intended, as well as the affect on nurse anesthetists as users. Conclusion Smart glasses improved access to vital signs and enabled continuous monitoring regardless of location. Continued development and improvement, both in terms of the application software and the hardware, are necessary for smart glasses to meet nurse anesthetists’ needs in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3155771745,"Marine diversity across the Australian continental shelf is shaped by characteristic benthic habitats which are determined by geomorphic features such as paleoshorelines. In north-western Australia there has been little attention on the fish communities that inhabit an ancient coastline at ~125 m depth (the designated AC125), which is specified as a key ecological feature (KEF) of the region and is thought to comprise hard substrate and support enhanced diversity. We investigated drivers of fish species richness and assemblage composition spanning six degrees of latitude along sections of the ancient coastline, categorised as ‘on’ and ‘off’ the AC125 based on depth, across a range of habitats and seafloor complexity (~60–180 m depth). While some surveyed sections of the AC125 had hard bottom substrate and supported enhanced fish diversity, including over half of the total species observed, species richness and abundance overall were not greater on the AC125 than immediately adjacent to the AC125. Instead, depth, seafloor complexity and habitat type explained patterns in richness and abundance, and structured fish assemblages at both local and broad spatial scales. Fewer fishes were associated with deep sites characterized by negligible complexity and soft-bottom habitats, in contrast to shallower depths that featured benthic biota and pockets of complex substrate. Drivers of abundance of common species were species-specific and primarily related to sampling Areas, depth and substrate. Fishes of the ancient coastline and adjacent habitats are representative of mesophotic fish communities of the region, included species important to fisheries and conservation, and several species were observed deeper than their currently known distribution. This study provides the first assessment of fish biodiversity associated with an ancient coastline feature, improving our understanding of the function it plays in regional spatial patterns in abundance of mesophotic fishes. Management decisions that incorporate the broader variety of depths and habitats surrounding the designated AC125 could enhance the ecological role of this KEF, contributing to effective conservation of fish biodiversity on Australia’s north west shelf."
https://openalex.org/W3153059560,"Many animals become more motivated to interact after a period of isolation. This phenomenon may involve general drives, e.g. for social touch or companionship, as well as drives that are specific to particular peers, and which ultimately serve to reestablish relationships between the individuals. Female degus are known to be affiliative with multiple other individuals, including unrelated and unfamiliar conspecifics, offering an opportunity to study social motivation independent from exclusive pair-bonds or overt, same-sex competition. We attempted to disentangle factors driving peer interaction by examining reunion behavior across several social isolation and separation manipulations. High levels of interaction were observed between adult females who had been separated even without isolation, revealing a drive to re-establish relationships with specific peers. The content of separation-only reunions differed from isolation, with the latter involving more early-session interaction, higher levels of allogrooming before rear-sniffing, and a higher ratio of chitter vocalizations. To assess whether post-isolation behavior was related to stress, we examined reunions following a non-social (footshock) stressor. Like isolation, footshock increased early-session interactions, but did not increase allogrooming before rear-sniffing or chittering, as compared with controls. To test whether separation-only reunion behavior shared qualities with relationship formation, we also examined reunions of new (stranger) dyads. Strangers exhibited higher levels of interaction than cagemates, with particularly high levels of late-session rear-sniffing. Like separation-only reunions, strangers showed more non-chitter vocalizations and lower levels of allogrooming before rear-sniffing. Across experiments, an exploratory clustering method was used to identify vocalizations that differed between conditions. This yielded promising leads for future investigation, including a chaff-type syllable that may have been more common during relationship renewal. Overall, results are consistent with the hypothesis that female degu reunions are supported by both general and peer-stimulus specific drives, expressed through the structure of physical and vocal interactions over time."
https://openalex.org/W3154805975,"4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), a terminal aromatic substituted fatty acid, is used widely to specifically attenuate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this study, we investigated the effect of 4-PBA on cardiac differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Herein, we found that 4-PBA regulated cardiac differentiation in a stage-specific manner just like trichostatin A (TSA), a well-known HDAC inhibitor. 4-PBA and TSA favored the early-stage differentiation, but inhibited the late-stage cardiac differentiation via acetylation. Mechanistic studies suggested that HDACs exhibited a temporal expression profiling during cardiomyogenesis. Hdac1 expression underwent a decrease at the early stage, while was upregulated at the late stage of cardiac induction. During the early stage of cardiac differentiation, acetylation favored the induction of Isl1 and Nkx2 . 5 , two transcription factors of cardiac progenitors. During the late stage, histone acetylation induced by 4-PBA or TSA interrupted the gene silence of Oct4 , a key determinant of self-renewal and pluripotency. Thereby, 4-PBA and TSA at the late stage hindered the exit from pluripotency, and attenuated the expression of cardiac-specific contractile proteins. Overexpression of HDAC1 and p300 exerted different effects at the distinct stages of cardiac induction. Collectively, our study shows that timely manipulation of HDACs exhibits distinct effects on cardiac differentiation. And the context-dependent effects of HDAC inhibitors depend on cell differentiation states marked by the temporal expression of pluripotency-associated genes."
https://openalex.org/W3155860150,"Cell phone use while driving is a common contributing factor in thousands of road traffic injuries every year globally. Despite extensive research investigating the risks associated with cell phone use while driving, social media campaigns to raise public awareness and a number of laws banning phone use while driving, this behaviour remains prevalent throughout the world. The current study was conducted in Iran, where road traffic injuries are the leading causes of death and disability, and where drivers continue to use their cell phones, despite legislative bans restricting this behaviour. A total of 255 drivers in the city of Mashhad (male = 66.3%; mean age = 30.73 years; SD = 9.89) completed either an online or a paper-based survey assessing the self-reported frequency of using a cell phone while driving. Psychosocial factors contributing to cell phone use while driving and support for legislation restricting this behaviour, as well as the Big Five personality traits, were also measured. Overall, the results showed that almost 93% of drivers use their cell phones while driving at least once a week, with 32.5% reporting they always use their cell phones while driving. Ordinal logistic regression revealed that the presence of a child passenger, age, perceived benefits and risks of using cell phones while driving, as well as the perceived ability to drive safely while using a cell phone, were strongly associated with the frequency of cell phone use while driving. As for personality traits—extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness significantly predicted the frequency of cell phone use in this sample of Iranian drivers."
https://openalex.org/W3152658086,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of turbo spin-echo (TSE) DWI with fusion images in the T-staging compared with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) alone and conventional echo-planner imaging (EPI) DWI. Methods In this prospective study, 4-mm-thick axial EPI-DWI, TSE-DWI, and T2WI were performed with the same slice locations for 20 patients with rectal cancer. Fusion images of DWI and T2WI were created for both EPI-DWI and TSE-DWI. Ten readers independently diagnosed the T-stages and scored the degree of confidence referring to T2WI alone and then to DWI, T2WI, and fusion images (DWI+T2WI) for each EPI-DWI and TSE-DWI. Visual score assessments of image quality were performed for each DWI. Results Inter-observer agreement of T-staging for 10 readers was slight on T2WI alone but fair on EPI-DWI+T2WI and excellent on TSE-DWI+T2WI images. No readers gave higher confidence scores for T2WI compared to EPI/TSE-DWI+T2WI and for EPI-DWI+T2WI compared to TSE-DWI+T2WI. In seven pathologically-proven cases, poor, poor to slight, and fair to perfect agreements with the pathological T-stage were observed with T2WI alone, EPI-DWI+T2WI, and TSE-DWI+T2WI, respectively. All readers gave higher scores regarding image distortion and lower scores regarding image noise for TSE-DWI compared to EPI-DWI. For DWI utility, higher scores were assigned for TSE-DWI compared to EPI-DWI in 7 readers and there were no significant differences in the other 3 readers. Conclusion TSE-DWI images might be more appropriate for image fusion with T2WI and rectal cancer T-staging compared with EPI-DWI and T2WI alone."
https://openalex.org/W3152924523,"Introduction The scale-up of Universal Test and Treat has resulted in reductions in HIV morbidity, mortality and incidence. However, healthcare system and personal challenges have impacted the levels of treatment coverage achieved. We implemented interventions to improve linkage to care, retention, viral load (VL) coverage and service delivery, and describe the HIV care cascade over the course of the Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) study. Methods BCPP was designed to evaluate the impact of prevention interventions on HIV incidence in 30 communities in Botswana. We followed a longitudinal cohort of newly identified and known HIV-positive persons not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) identified through community-based testing activities through BCPP and referred with appointments to local HIV clinics in 15 intervention communities. Those who did not keep the first or follow-up appointments were tracked and traced through phone and home contacts. Improvements to service delivery models in the intervention clinics were also implemented. Results A total of 3,657 newly identified or HIV-positive persons not on ART were identified and referred to their local HIV clinic; 90% (3,282/3,657) linked to care and of those, 93% (3,066/3,282) initiated treatment. Near the end of the study, 221 persons remained &gt;90 days late for appointments or missing. Tracing efforts identified 54/3,066 (2%) persons who initiated treatment but died, and 106/3,066 (3%) persons were located and returned to treatment. At study end, 61/3,066 (2%) persons remained missing and were never reached. Overall, 2,951 (98%) persons living with HIV (PLHIV) who initiated treatment were still alive, retained in care and still receiving ART out of the 3,001 persons alive at the end of the study. Of those on ART, 2,854 (97%) had current VL results and 2,784 (98%) of those were virally suppressed at study end. Conclusions This study achieved high rates of linkage, treatment initiation, retention and VL coverage and suppression in a cohort of newly identified and known PLHIV not on ART. Tracking and tracing interventions effectively identified those persons who needed more resource intensive follow-up. The interventions implemented to improve service delivery and data quality may have also contributed to high linkage and retention rates. Clinical trial number : NCT01965470 ."
https://openalex.org/W3153137123,"Purpose To investigate the effectiveness of aerosol clearance using an aerosol box, aerosol bag, wall suction, and a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter evacuator to prevent aerosol transmission. Methods The flow field was visualized using three protective device settings (an aerosol box, and an aerosol bag with and without sealed working channels) and four suction settings (no suction, wall suction, and a HEPA filter evacuator at flow rates of 415 liters per minute [LPM] and 530 LPM). All 12 subgroups were compared with a no intervention group. The primary outcome, aerosol concentration, was measured at the head, trunk, and foot of a mannequin. Results The mean aerosol concentration was reduced at the head ( p &lt; 0.001) but increased at the feet ( p = 0.005) with an aerosol box compared with no intervention. Non-sealed aerosol bags increased exposure at the head and trunk (both, p &lt; 0.001). Sealed aerosol bags reduced aerosol concentration at the head, trunk, and foot of the mannequin ( p &lt; 0.001). A sealed aerosol bag alone, with wall suction, or with a HEPA filter evacuator reduced the aerosol concentration at the head by 7.15%, 36.61%, and 84.70%, respectively (99.9% confidence interval [CI]: -4.51–18.81, 27.48–45.73, and 78.99–90.40); trunk by 70.95%, 73.99%, and 91.59%, respectively (99.9% CI: 59.83–82.07, 52.64–95.33, and 87.51–95.66); and feet by 69.16%, 75.57%, and 92.30%, respectively (99.9% CI: 63.18–75.15, 69.76–81.37, and 88.18–96.42), compared with an aerosol box alone. Conclusions As aerosols spread, an airtight container with sealed working channels is effective when combined with suction devices."
https://openalex.org/W3154527169,"Background Type 2 diabetes is rapidly becoming a significant challenge in Uganda and other low and middle-income countries. A large proportion of the population remains undiagnosed. To understand diagnostic delay, we explored the diagnostic pathways for diabetes among patients receiving care at a semi-urban district hospital in eastern Uganda. Methods Eligible participants were patients aged 35–70 years receiving care at the diabetes clinic of Iganga district hospital between April and May 2019 and their healthcare providers. Patients were interviewed using an interview guide to collect information on patients’ symptoms and their diagnostic experience. A separate interview guide was used to understand the organisation of the diabetes services and the diabetes diagnostic process at the hospital. Using maximum variation purposive sampling, we selected 17 diabetes patients aged 35–68 years, diagnosed within the previous three years, and the three health workers managing the diabetes clinic at Iganga hospital. The data was analysed using ATLAS.ti version 8 to code, organise and track the data segments. We conducted template analysis using a priori themes derived from the intervals of Walter’s model of Pathways to Treatment to identify the factors influencing diagnostic delay. Results We identified four typologies: a short diagnostic pathway, protracted appraisal pathway, protracted appraisal and diagnostic interval pathway, and delayed treatment pathway. The pathways of patients with protracted appraisal or diagnostic intervals demonstrated strong socio-cultural influences. There was a firm reliance on traditional healers both before and after diagnosis which deferred enrolment into care. Other health system barriers implicated in delayed diagnosis included stock-out of diagnostic supplies, misdiagnosis, and missed diagnosis. Denial of diagnosis was also found to lead to delayed initiation of care. Conclusion Reducing diagnostic delay requires addressing both negative socio-cultural influences and the adoption of system-wide interventions to address barriers to timely diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3154562784,"Blaine County, Idaho, a rural area with a renowned resort, experienced a COVID-19 outbreak early in the pandemic. We undertook an epidemiologic investigation to describe the outbreak and guide public health action. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from reports of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory test results to South Central Public Health District. Information on symptoms, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close contacts was obtained by medical record review and patient interviews. Viral sequence analysis was conducted on a subset of available specimens. During March 13–April 10, 2020, a total of 451 COVID-19 cases among Blaine County residents (1,959 cases per 100,000 population) were reported, with earliest illness onset March 1. The median patient age was 51 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 37–63), 52 (11.5%) were hospitalized, and 5 (1.1%) died. The median duration between specimen collection and a positive laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4–10). Forty-four (9.8%) patients reported recent travel and an additional 37 cases occurred in out-of-state residents. Healthcare workers comprised 56 (12.4%) cases; 33 of whom worked at the only hospital in the county, leading to a 15-day disruption of hospital services. Among 562 close contacts monitored by public health authorities, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or compatible symptoms were identified in 51 (9.1%). Sequencing results from 34 specimens supported epidemiologic findings indicating travel as a source of SARS-CoV-2, and identified multiple lineages among hospital workers. Community mitigation strategies included school and resort closure, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on incoming travelers. COVID-19 outbreaks in rural communities can disrupt health services. Lack of local laboratory capacity led to long turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. Rural communities frequented by tourists face unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementing restrictions on incoming travelers and other mitigation strategies helped reduce COVID-19 transmission early in the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3156863267,"Objectives To investigate the prognostic significance of sarcopenic cachexia compared to sarcopenia without cachexia in the outcomes of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). Materials and methods Between 2011 and 2016, 163 patients with UTUC who received RNU at a tertiary medical center were included. Pre-operatively clinical data, history, and abdominal computer tomography scans were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnosis of sarcopenia was based on abdominal computed tomography data on the patient’s skeletal muscles. Outcomes of relapse-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival were analyzed by multivariate Cox regression. Results After adjusting for age, sex, pre-operatively estimated glomerular filtration rate, body mass index, underlying diseases, tumor grade, and tumor stage, cachexia was a significant poor prognostic factor for relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 18.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.87–118, p = 0.002) and cancer-specific survival (HR: 26.6, 95% CI: 4.04–175, p = 0.001). In contrast, sarcopenia without cachexia was not a significant predictor of cancer outcomes. Conclusions To date, this is the first study to investigate the effect of cachexia among sarcopenic patients with UTUC treated with RNU. We identified the prognostic significance of cachexia on outcomes. Indeed, when UTUC is treated with RNU, we should evaluate not only sarcopenia status but also cachexia. The low survival rate among patients with UTUC complicated with cachexia deserves attention."
https://openalex.org/W3152637596,"Background The endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) is used to evaluate exercise tolerance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The recommended pre-intervention tolerated duration (Tlim) is between 3–8 minutes for optimal interpretation of treatment effects. However, this window may be exceeded and factors determining ESWT Tlim are not completely understood. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether pulmonary function, physical and incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) performance measures are associated with ESWT Tlim in COPD patients. Methods Assessment data from patients eligible for pulmonary rehabilitation was retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of COPD and complete data availability regarding ESWT and ISWT. Patients performed an ESWT at 85% of ISWT speed and were divided into three groups (ESWT Tlim: &lt;3 minutes, 3–8 minutes, &gt;8 minutes). Subject characteristics, severity of complaints, pulmonary function, physical capacity and activity, exercise tolerance and quadriceps muscle strength were evaluated. Results 245 COPD patients (FEV 1 38 (29–52)% predicted) were included. Median ESWT Tlim was 6.0 (3.7–10.3) minutes, 41 (17%) patients walked &lt;3 minutes and 80 (33%) patients walked &gt;8 minutes. Body mass index, maximal oxygen consumption, Tlim on constant work rate cycle test, physical activity level, maximal ISWT speed, dyspnoea Borg score at rest and increase of leg fatigue Borg score during ISWT independently predicted Tlim in multivariate regression analysis (R 2 = 0.297, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion This study reported a large variability in ESWT Tlim in COPD patients. Secondly, these results demonstrated that next to maximal ISWT speed, other ISWT performance measures as well as clinical measures of pulmonary function, physical capacity and physical activity were independent determinants of ESWT Tlim. Nevertheless, as these determinants only explained ~30% of the variability, future studies are needed to establish whether additional factors can be used to better adjust individual ESWT pace in order to reduce ESWT Tlim variability."
https://openalex.org/W3155145979,"Suicide occurs in people of all ages and backgrounds, which negatively affects families, communities, and the health care providers (HCPs) who care for them. The objective of this study was to better understand HCPs’ perspectives of everyday ethical issues related to caring for suicidal patients, and their perceived needs for training and/or support to address these issues. We conducted a mixed methods survey among HCPs working in mental health in Québec, Canada. Survey questions addressed their perspectives and experiences of everyday ethical challenges they encounter in their practice with people who are suicidal, and their perceived needs for training and/or support therein. 477 HCPs completed the survey. Most participants mentioned encountering ethical issues when caring for people who are suicidal. The challenges HCPs encounter in their practice with people who are suicidal are numerous, including issues related to maintaining privacy, confidentiality, freedom and the therapeutic relationship. The lack of time, resources and professional support to address these issues was emphasized. Most HCPs reported that the training or education they have received does not allow them to address everyday ethical issues related to suicide care. In sum, there is a clear reported need for better training and support for HCPs who are offering care to people who are suicidal in relation to everyday ethical issues they encounter. Implications for practice include providing greater access to training, including access to specialists in ethics to address specific issues. This additional support could alleviate morally distressing situations for HCPs."
