https://openalex.org/W2096421416,"Research on graphene and other two-dimensional atomic crystals is intense and likely to remain one of the hottest topics in condensed matter physics and materials science for many years. Looking beyond this field, isolated atomic planes can also be reassembled into designer heterostructures made layer by layer in a precisely chosen sequence. The first - already remarkably complex - such heterostructures (referred to as 'van der Waals') have recently been fabricated and investigated revealing unusual properties and new phenomena. Here we review this emerging research area and attempt to identify future directions. With steady improvement in fabrication techniques, van der Waals heterostructures promise a new gold rush, rather than a graphene aftershock."
https://openalex.org/W1983650084,"The genome sequence of the African oil palm, the main source of oil production, is used to predict at least 34,802 genes, including oil biosynthesis genes; comparison with the draft sequence of the South American oil palm reveals that the two species may have diverged in the New World and that segmental duplications of chromosome arms define the palaeotetraploid origin of palm trees. Two papers published in this issue of Nature deal with the genetics of two variants of one of the most important crops in use today — the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis and its South American cousin Elaeis oleifera. Palm oil accounts for almost half the edible oil consumed worldwide and is also a biofuel, although not without controversy, as in many areas palm oil monoculture has replaced valuable natural forest. Analyses of the 1.8-gigabase genome sequence of E. guineensis and draft sequence of E. oleifera provide insights into oil biosynthesis genes and their regulators, and a record of genome evolution. A key event in the domestication and breeding of the oil palm was loss of the thick, coconut-like shell. The second of the two papers identifies mutations the SHELL gene that specify the different fruit forms found in the oil palm and shows that SHELL gene mutations that originated in pre-colonial Africa are responsible for the single gene hybrid vigour and high yields attained by the oil palm. Oil palm is the most productive oil-bearing crop. Although it is planted on only 5% of the total world vegetable oil acreage, palm oil accounts for 33% of vegetable oil and 45% of edible oil worldwide, but increased cultivation competes with dwindling rainforest reserves. We report the 1.8-gigabase (Gb) genome sequence of the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis, the predominant source of worldwide oil production. A total of 1.535 Gb of assembled sequence and transcriptome data from 30 tissue types were used to predict at least 34,802 genes, including oil biosynthesis genes and homologues of WRINKLED1 (WRI1), and other transcriptional regulators1, which are highly expressed in the kernel. We also report the draft sequence of the South American oil palm Elaeis oleifera, which has the same number of chromosomes (2n = 32) and produces fertile interspecific hybrids with E. guineensis2 but seems to have diverged in the New World. Segmental duplications of chromosome arms define the palaeotetraploid origin of palm trees. The oil palm sequence enables the discovery of genes for important traits as well as somaclonal epigenetic alterations that restrict the use of clones in commercial plantings3, and should therefore help to achieve sustainability for biofuels and edible oils, reducing the rainforest footprint of this tropical plantation crop."

https://openalex.org/W2131085014,"Recent studies have demonstrated that discriminatory salivary biomarkers can be readily detected upon the development of systemic diseases such as pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. However, the utility of salivary biomarkers for the detection of systemic diseases has been undermined due to the absence of the biological and mechanistic rationale as to why distal diseases from the oral cavity would lead to the development of discriminatory biomarkers in saliva. Here, we examine the hypothesis that pancreatic tumor-derived exosomes are mechanistically involved in the development of pancreatic cancer-discriminatory salivary transcriptomic biomarkers. We first developed a pancreatic cancer mouse model that yielded discriminatory salivary biomarkers by implanting the mouse pancreatic cancer cell line Panc02 into the pancreas of the syngeneic host C57BL/6. The role of pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes in the development of discriminatory salivary biomarkers was then tested by engineering a Panc02 cell line that is suppressed for exosome biogenesis, implanting into the C56BL/6 mouse, and examining whether the discriminatory salivary biomarker profile was ablated or disrupted.

Significance: Tumor-derived exosomes provide the scientific rationale that connects pancreatic tumors and the oral cavity leading to salivary biomarkers. Discriminatory salivary biomarkers for the detection of systemic diseases have emerged in the last decade with the availability of high throughput omics technologies and systems biology tools. Because collection is noninvasive and easily accessible, using saliva for the early detection of systemic diseases is ideal. To date, transcriptomic and proteomic salivary biomarkers discriminatory for systemic diseases such as breast, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancer have been successfully discovered and pre-validated (1Zhang L. Farrell J.J. Zhou H. Elashoff D. Akin D. Park N.H. Chia D. Wong D.T.

Proteomics. 2012; 11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, with the development of these disease-specific biomarkers arises the pertinent question of how discriminatory profiles of biomarkers for diseases developing distally from the oral cavity would appear in saliva. Presently, the answer to this puzzling question remains elusive. In 2010, Palanisamy et al. (4Palanisamy V. Sharma S. Deshpande A. Zhou H. Gimzewski J. Wong D.T. Nanostructural and transcriptomic analyses of human saliva derived exosomes.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) showed that saliva contained exosomes where these transferable saliva-derived microvesicles were found to contain proteins and functional mRNA. Moreover, we recently showed that breast cancer-derived exosome-like microvesicles are capable of activating transcription in salivary gland cells and ultimately altering the salivary gland cell-derived exosome-like microvesicles both proteomically and transcriptomically (5Lau C.S. Wong D.T. Breast cancer exosome-like microvesicles and salivary gland cells interplay alters salivary gland cell-derived exosome-like microvesicles in vitro.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e33037Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that tumor-derived exosomes could function as the shuttle between the distal tumor and the oral cavity leading to the development of discriminatory salivary biomarkers. Exosomes are durable, cell-specific lipid microvesicles (30–100 nm) that are able to migrate systemically through the vasculature of the body promoting intercellular communication (6Johnstone R.M. Exosomes biological significance: A concise review.Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2006; 36: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). They reside in a multitude of biofluids, including urine, blood, breast milk, bronchial lavage fluid, cerebral spinal fluids, and saliva (4Palanisamy V. Sharma S. Deshpande A. Zhou H. Gimzewski J.

Even though specific physiological implications of exosomes have yet been elucidated, the literature suggests that they are involved in a variety of functions, ranging from immune response regulators to tumor invasion promoters (12Somasundaram R. Herlyn M. Melanoma exosomes: messengers of metastasis.Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 853-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Peinado H. Aleckovic M. Lavotshkin S. Matei I. Costa-Silva B.

Med. 2012; 18: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar). This study provides an in vivo examination of the mechanism for salivary biomarker development in a systemic disease. We hypothesized that tumor-derived exosomes play a pivotal role in the development of pancreatic cancer-specific salivary transcriptomic biomarkers. We tested our hypothesis by using an orthotopic, syngeneic pancreatic cancer mouse model. First, we developed a panel of salivary transcriptomic biomarkers discriminatory for pancreatic cancer in the rodent model. Second, we demonstrated that inhibiting the biogenesis and secretion of exosomes at the tumor source disrupted the panel's pancreatic cancer-specific transcriptomic salivary biomarkers. The findings of this in vivo study illustrated that the inhibition of pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes in mice altered the disease-specific salivary transcriptomic biomarker profile, supporting that tumor-derived exosomes play a role in the development of disease-specific discriminatory biomarkers in saliva. The following reagents were used: McCoy's 5A medium (DMEM, Invitrogen); fetal bovine serum (FBS, Cellgro); 100× penicillin/streptomycin (5000 μg/ml, Cellgro), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen); Lipofectamine (Invitrogen); paraformaldehyde (Sigma); green fluorescence protein (GFP) antibody (Cell Signaling); β-actin antibody (Sigma); horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Invitrogen); ketamine (60 mg/ml; Phoenix Scientific, St. Joseph, MO); xylazine (8 mg/ml; Phoenix Scientific); pilocarpine (0.05 mg pilocarpine/100g body weight; Sigma); geneticin (G418, 400 μg/ml; Sigma); Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen); DNase (Ambion); RiboAmp RNA amplification kit (Molecular Devices); and GeneChip Expression 3′-amplification reagents (Affymetrix). Six- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed in the Division of Laboratory Medicine at UCLA. The Chancellor's Animal Research Committee at UCLA approved the experimental protocols. The pancreatic cancer mouse model was induced by orthotopic injection of 1.0 × 106 Panc02 cells in 30 μl of PBS into the mouse pancreas. After 4 weeks, mice were sacrificed, and pancreatic tumors were observed histologically. Saliva, blood, and tumor tissue from mice were collected as described previously (26Gao K. Zhou H. Zhang L. Lee J.W. Zhou Q. Hu S. Wolinsky L.E. Farrell J. Eibl G. Wong D.T. Systemic disease-induced salivary biomarker profiles in mouse models of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Upon the development of the pancreatic tumor (4 weeks), saliva was collected, and then the mouse was sacrificed. Mild anesthesia was induced by intramuscular of 1 μl/kg body weight of a solution containing 60 mg/ml ketamine and 8 mg/ml xylazine. Salivation was induced by subcutaneous injection of pilocarpine (0.05 mg pilocarpine/100 g body weight) between the ears of the mice; saliva was obtained from the oral cavity by micropipette and immediately placed on pre-chilled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The samples were stored in −80 °C until analyzed. For the validation of pancreatic cancer-specific salivary transcriptomic biomarkers, C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to a control group and a tumor group (22 animals per group). To determine whether inhibition of tumor-derived exosomes altered pancreatic cancer-specific salivary transcriptomic biomarkers, C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to a control group, tumor group 1 (with Panc02-expressing GFP) and tumor group 2 (with Panc02-expressing DN-Rab11-GFP; 22 animals per group). Fig. 1 provides the schematic summarizing the complete procedure. Blood was collected in a Serum Gel Z/1.1 tube, and serum was extracted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min after mice were sacrificed. Salivary glands and pancreatic tumor tissues were removed from mice, snap-frozen in liquid, and stored in −80 °C until analyzed. On ice, tissue sample was submerged in TRIzol (Invitrogen; 1 ml of TRIzol/50–100 mg of tissue). Tissues were homogenized in the TRIzol solution until no visible particles remained. Addition of chloroform (Sigma) and subsequent centrifugation at 14,000 × g separated the mixture into three phases (lower red phenol/chloroform phase, interphase, and upper aqueous phase). The upper aqueous phase was then extracted and mixed with the 100% isopropyl alcohol (Sigma) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 7500 × g, air dried, resuspended in RNase-free water, and analyzed. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 6 h, washed with PBS, and then submerged in 30% EtOH overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were submerged in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were subsequently sectioned at ∼5 μm slices and stained with hematoxylin and eosin solutions at the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Microscopic Techniques Core Facility at the UCLA Brain Research Institute. Murine pancreatic cell line Panc02 was obtained from Dr. Guido Eibl, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Panc02 is a methylcholanthrene-induced pancreatic carcinoma that is syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice (27Morikane K. Tempero R.M. Sivinski C.L. Nomoto M. Van Lith M.L. Muto T. Hollingsworth M.A. Organ-specific pancreatic tumor growth properties and tumor immunity.Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1999; 47: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were maintained in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Plasmids pEGFP-C1 (GFP) and pEGFP-C1-Rab11-DN (Addgene plasmid 12678; 4 μg; DN-Rab11-GFP) were transfected into Panc02 cultured in 6-well plates at ∼85% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000 via the manufacturer's protocol. Panc02 cells were passaged at 1:10 into a 12-well plate 24 h post-transfection and into fresh McCoy's 5A medium with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin. 48 h after transfection, 400 μg/ml of geneticin were added; after 3 weeks in selection, the surviving colonies were isolated to a 24-well plate and expanded. For the discovery of candidate pancreatic cancer-discriminatory salivary transcriptomic biomarkers, saliva RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's protocol. There were 30 mice each in the control and tumor group. Samples derived from five mice in each group were pooled for RNA extraction. Pooling was necessary to ensure that sufficient salivary mRNA was obtained for microarray analyses. Isolated total RNA was treated with recombinant DNase. For microarray analysis, mRNA from mouse saliva was linearly amplified using the RiboAmp RNA amplification kit (Molecular Devices). After purification, cDNAs were transcribed in vitro and biotinylated using GeneChip Expression 3′-amplification reagents for labeling of transcripts (Affymetrix). The labeled RNAs (15 μg each) were subsequently fragmented and sent to the UCLA Microarray Core Facility for array hybridization and scanning. The GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array, which represents >39,000 transcripts and variants, was used for profiling analysis. The microarray data have been uploaded to www.ncbi. nlm.gov. The accession number is GSE47811. Arrays were analyzed using R 2.7.0. The probe logarithmic intensity error estimation (PLIER) expression measures were computed after background correction and quantile normalization. Quantile normalization was performed across all samples to make the distributions similar and comparable among all probe sets. For every probe set, the two-sample t test was applied to identify differential expression between saliva samples obtained from pancreatic cancer-bearing mice and healthy mice. After obtaining the estimates and p values for each probe set, we corrected the p values for the false discovery rate. A score was then generated based on the corrected p values and differential expression levels. The heat map dendrogram was constructed using agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the 209 significantly up-regulated genes. DSTA 2The abbreviations used are: DSTA, direct saliva transcriptomic analysis; AchE, acetylcholinesterase; TMB, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine; qPCR, quantitative PCR; EFIRM, electric field-induced release and measurement; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; csw, cyclic square wave. was conducted as described previously (20Lee Y.H. Zhou H. Reiss J.K. Yan X. Zhang L. Chia D. Wong D.T. Direct saliva transcriptome analysis.Clin. Chem. 2011; 57: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Saliva collected from mice was analyzed by a two-step RT-PCR followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), operated separately. The PCR primers for the 20 genes (supplemental Table S1) were designed using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Multiplex RT-PCR preamplification of the 20 mRNAs was performed by using SuperScript III platinum qRT-PCR system (Invitrogen) with a pool of outer primer sets (100 μmol/ml for each), and conducted by a GeneAmp PCR-System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) with a fixed thermal cycling program. Cell lysates were resuspended in Laemmli Sample Buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, w/v) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk solution and incubated with GFP (Cell Signaling) or β-actin antibody (Abcam), followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. The proteins were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). Panc02 cells or pancreas images were taken on Olympus IX80 using ×20 or ×40 objectives. Panc02 cells were grown to 80% confluency and incubated in DMEM + 10% exosome-free FBS for 48 h. The culture supernatant was centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min to remove suspended cells. The cell pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min to remove dead cells and then 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris. Next, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min, the supernatant removed, the pellet washed with PBS, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min, and then filtered using a 0.22-μm PVDF syringe filter (Millipore), resulting in purified exosome-like microvesicles. The amount of released exosomes was quantified by using the Amplex® red acetylcholine/acetylcholinesterase assay kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Acetylcholinesterase (AchE) is an enzyme that is specifically directed to exosomes (15Savina A. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. The exosome pathway in K562 cells is regulated by Rab11.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the data represent AchE enzymatic activity (nanounits/microliter/cell) after 30 min of incubation. For rapid, effective extraction, magnetic bead-based technology was applied to isolate and accumulate exosomes. The magnetic beads were ∼1–2 μm in diameter, as measured by TEM. Briefly, the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen) were mixed with biotinylated lectin specific to α-2,6-linked sialic acid (28Kesimer M. Scull M. Brighton B. DeMaria G. Burns K. O'Neal W. Pickles R.J. Sheehan J.K. Characterization of exosome-like vesicles released from human tracheobronchial ciliated epithelium: a possible role in innate defense.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) (Vector Laboratories) on a mixer for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 10 μl of Panc02 cell medium, serum, or saliva were incubated with the lectin-conjugated magnetic beads in casein-PBS (Invitrogen). Samples were mixed for 2 h at room temperature to form exosome-magnetic bead complexes. Next, exosome-magnetic bead complexes were attracted onto the electrochemical sensor by applying an array of magnets. The unattached species were removed by washing. Seven exosomal mRNAs were measured by EFIRM. For mRNA detection, the electrodes were coated with a surface matrix of conducting polymer pyrrole. Then the surface of the electrode was pre-coated with oligonucleotide capture probes with sequences specific for the selected seven genes in addition to GAPDH as a reference gene and a biotin label at the 5′ end. The immobilizations of the capture probes were carried out by applying a csw-E field for 20 cycles of 9 s at −300 mV followed by 1 s at +200 mV (200 s total) (29Wei F. Patel P. Liao W. Chaudhry K. Zhang L. Arellano-Garcia M. Hu S. Elashoff D. Zhou H. Shukla S. Shah F. Ho C.M. Wong D.T. Electrochemical sensor for multiplex biomarkers detection.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 4446-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). After the exosome extraction step, the exosome-magnetic bead complex was collected onto the capture probe-coated electrode with an array of magnets placed underneath the electrochemical sensor. When loading the sample onto the electrode, 10 nm of detector probes (with a fluorescein-labeled 3′ end) were mixed in with the exosome-magnetic bead complexes. The csw-E field was then applied to release the exosomal mRNA from the exosomes. The csw-E field was 20 cycles of 9 s at −300 mV followed by 1 s at +200 mV (200 s total) for the hybridization with the oligonucleotide capture and detector probes. Then, we added 150 units/ml of anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 1:1000 dilution; Roche Applied Science). Finally, the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate for horseradish peroxidase was loaded, and an amperometric signal was read out. The serum and saliva samples were loaded onto carbon-coated grids. Because of interference between the magnetic beads and the electric field of the electron microscope, specific grids were used to hold the magnetic beads. In addition, we used support film for TEM with a wide dynamic range to accommodate the size differences between the magnetic beads (1–2 μm diameter) and the exosomes (60–100 nm diameter). We selected Lacey Formvar/Carbon with 200-mesh copper (Ted-Peller) for the TEM support film. The samples were examined with a JEOL 100CX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA). The electrochemical sensor was an array of 16 bare gold electrode chips (Gene Fluidics). Each unit of the array had a working electrode, a counter electrode, and a reference electrode. The species to be measured were immobilized on the working electrode. The array of 16 plastic wells separated each three-electrode set, which avoided cross-contamination between different sensors. A conducting polymer was deposited on the working electrodes as supporting film. The 16-channel electrochemical reader (Gene Fluidics Inc.) controlled the electrical field applied to the 16 array sensors and simultaneously recorded the amperometric current (29Wei F. Patel P. Liao W. Chaudhry K. Zhang L. Arellano-Garcia M. Hu S. Elashoff D. Zhou H. Shukla S. Shah F. Ho C.M. Wong D.T. Electrochemical sensor for multiplex biomarkers detection.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 4446-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Wei F. Liao W. Xu Z. Yang Y. Wong D.T. Ho C.M. Bio/abiotic interface constructed from nanoscale DNA dendrimer and conducting polymer for ultrasensitive biomolecular diagnosis.SMALL. 2009; 5: 1784-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All the electrical potentials in the following steps were relative to the gold reference electrode, which was determined to be +218 mV. In contrast, saturated calomel electrode was determined by measuring cyclic voltammetric curves of 0.1 mm [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−. For the experiments, solutions were loaded onto the whole area of the three-electrode region contained within the plastic wells. For the release and reaction steps, the csw-E field was applied. The signal readout was the electrochemical current from the HRP reaction. The TMB substrate (TMB/H2O2, low activity) (Neogen) was loaded, and amperometric detection was carried out by applying −200 mV to each electrode unit, followed by a parallel amperometric signal readout after 60 s of equilibration. TMB acts as a mediator; it is reduced at −200 mV, and in turn, the reduced TMB reduces the oxidized form of HRP. HRP then reduces H2O2 to two H2O molecules, and the HRP is re-oxidized. All graphs were made and statistical analyses performed using R 2.7.0, GraphPad Prism, SAS 9.3, or Microsoft Excel 2007. The heat map dendrogram was constructed using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Groups were formed based on the average linkage function. One-way analysis of variance, two-sample t tests were used for testing the difference between expression values. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to determine whether the adjusted ΔCt values differed between groups (p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The Panc02/C57BL/6 orthotopic, syngeneic mouse pancreatic cancer model is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Orthotopic injections of Panc02 cells into mouse pancreases induced pancreatic cancer in ∼4 weeks (supplemental Fig. S1, A–H). Expression microarray analysis of the saliva collected from both the cancer-bearing and noncancer control mice revealed different saliva profiles between the two groups.

https://openalex.org/W1979576354,"A key event in the domestication and breeding of the oil palm Elaeis guineensis was loss of the thick coconut-like shell surrounding the kernel. Modern E. guineensis has three fruit forms, dura (thick-shelled), pisifera (shell-less) and tenera (thin-shelled), a hybrid between dura and pisifera. The pisifera palm is usually female-sterile. The tenera palm yields far more oil than dura, and is the basis for commercial palm oil production in all of southeast Asia. Here we describe the mapping and identification of the SHELL gene responsible for the different fruit forms. Using homozygosity mapping by sequencing, we found two independent mutations in the DNA-binding domain of a homologue of the MADS-box gene SEEDSTICK (STK, also known as AGAMOUS-LIKE 11), which controls ovule identity and seed development in Arabidopsis. The SHELL gene is responsible for the tenera phenotype in both cultivated and wild palms from sub-Saharan Africa, and our findings provide a genetic explanation for the single gene hybrid vigour (or heterosis) attributed to SHELL, via heterodimerization. This gene mutation explains the single most important economic trait in oil palm, and has implications for the competing interests of global edible oil production, biofuels and rainforest conservation."

https://openalex.org/W2049201889,"Although the capacity for tissue regeneration of planarians is exceptional, planarians with more limited regenerative capacities are known; here knocking down components of the Wnt signalling pathway rescues head regeneration in the regeneration-impaired planarian Dendrocoelum lacteum, revealing that manipulating a single signalling pathway can reverse the evolutionary loss of regenerative potential. Planarians are flatworms common in streams and ponds whose capacity for tissue regeneration is legendary. But with more limited regenerative capacities are known. Three papers published in Nature this week study Planaria with differing regenerative capacities and identify the Wnt/β-catenin molecular signalling pathway, important in embryonic development and adult homeostasis in multicellular organisms, as central to the regeneration mechanism. Yoshihiko Umesono et al. identify ERK and β-catenin signalling as the basis for a morphogenetic gradient along the anterior–posterior axis that is required for regeneration. These authors also demonstrate that inhibition of β-catenin can rescue head regeneration in Phagocata kawakatsui, a planarian that otherwise cannot regenerate heads from the posterior pieces. James Sikes and Phillip Newmark show in Procotyla fluviatilis, which has restricted ability to replace missing tissues, that Wnt signalling is aberrantly regulated in regeneration-deficient tissues. Downregulation of Wnt signalling in these regions restores regenerative abilities, including the formation of blastemas and even new heads. Jochen Rink and colleagues show that in the otherwise regeneration-incompetent Dendrocoelum lacteum, knockdown of components in the Wnt signalling pathway introduces the ability to regenerate lost tissues. Species capable of regenerating lost body parts occur throughout the animal kingdom, yet close relatives are often regeneration incompetent1,2. Why in the face of ‘survival of the fittest’ some animals regenerate but others do not remains a fascinating question3. Planarian flatworms are well known and studied for their ability to regenerate from minute tissue pieces, yet species with limited regeneration abilities have been described even amongst planarians4. Here we report the characterization of the regeneration defect in the planarian Dendrocoelum lacteum and its successful rescue. Tissue fragments cut from the posterior half of the body of this species are unable to regenerate a head and ultimately die5. We find that this defect originates during the early stages of head specification, which require inhibition of canonical Wnt signalling in other planarian species6,7,8. Notably, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of Dlac-β-catenin-1, the Wnt signal transducer, restored the regeneration of fully functional heads on tail pieces, rescuing D. lacteum’s regeneration defect. Our results demonstrate the utility of comparative studies towards the reactivation of regenerative abilities in regeneration-deficient animals. Furthermore, the availability of D. lacteum as a regeneration-impaired planarian model species provides a first step towards elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms that ultimately determine why some animals regenerate and others do not."

https://openalex.org/W2013844116,"NAD+ is mainly synthesized in human cells via the “salvage” pathways starting from nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, or nicotinamide riboside (NR). The inhibition with FK866 of the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), catalyzing the first reaction in the “salvage” pathway from nicotinamide, showed potent antitumor activity in several preclinical models of solid and hematologic cancers. In the clinical studies performed with FK866, however, no tumor remission was observed. Here we demonstrate that low micromolar concentrations of extracellular NAD+ or NAD+ precursors, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and NR, can reverse the FK866-induced cell death, this representing a plausible explanation for the failure of NAMPT inhibition as an anti-cancer therapy. NMN is a substrate of both ectoenzymes CD38 and CD73, with generation of NAM and NR, respectively. In this study, we investigated the roles of CD38 and CD73 in providing ectocellular NAD+ precursors for NAD+ biosynthesis and in modulating cell susceptibility to FK866. By specifically silencing or overexpressing CD38 and CD73, we demonstrated that endogenous CD73 enables, whereas CD38 impairs, the conversion of extracellular NMN to NR as a precursor for intracellular NAD+ biosynthesis in human cells. Moreover, cell viability in FK866-treated cells supplemented with extracellular NMN was strongly reduced in tumor cells, upon pharmacological inhibition or specific down-regulation of CD73. Thus, our study suggests that genetic or pharmacologic interventions interfering with CD73 activity may prove useful to increase cancer cell sensitivity to NAMPT inhibitors.Background: NAMPT inhibitors showed antitumor activity in preclinical cancer models, but no tumor remission occurred in clinical studies.Results: Cells treated with a NAMPT inhibitor are rescued by low NAD+e or NAD+ precursors, depending on CD38 and CD73 expression.Conclusion: CD73 enables, whereas CD38 impairs, extracellular NMN utilization by cells for NAD+ biosynthesis.Significance: Combining CD73 and NAMPT inhibition could represent a new anti-cancer strategy.

Recently, the ectoenzyme CD73, a 5′-nucleotidase mainly active on adenosine monophosphate (AMP), has been demonstrated by experiments with the purified recombinant protein to be able to dephosphorylate NMN to produce NR (40.Garavaglia S.

The aim of this study was to better understand the role of NAD+-degrading ectoenzymes, such as CD38 and CD73, in providing ectocellular NAD+ precursors for NAD+ biosynthesis and in modulating cell susceptibility to FK866. We demonstrate that endogenous CD73 enables, whereas CD38 impairs, the utilization of extracellular NMN as a precursor for intracellular NAD+ biosynthesis in human cells by converting NMN to NR. Our results highlight the possibility of implementing antitumor therapies based on combined inhibition of NAMPT and CD73. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. FK866 was generously provided by the NIMH, National Institutes of Health, Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program. In this study, FK866 was used at a final concentration of 30 nm. This is the minimum concentration resulting, after 72-h incubation, in >80% cell death, a necessary condition to evaluate the rescue effects from the FK866-induced cell death in different experimental conditions. The mimetic peptide Gap26 (VCYDKSFPISHVR; 0.25 mg/ml) and scrambled Gap26 (PSFDSRHCIVKYV; 0.25 mg/ml) were synthesized as described (41.Wellings D.A. Atherton E. Standard Fmoc protocols.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To prepare NR, 25 μmol of NAD+ was treated with 5 units of Crotalus adamanteus venom nucleotide pyrophosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 40 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 h at 37 °C, in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm MgCl2 (final volume, 0.3 ml). The reaction was stopped with 150 μl of 1.2 m HClO4, and after 15 min on ice, the sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. Aliquots (400 μl) of the supernatant were neutralized with 80 μl of 1 m K2CO3, kept on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged as described above. Fifty-μl aliquots of the supernatants were loaded onto a Phenomenex C18 Kinetex column (2.6 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm). Elution conditions were as follows: 2 min at 100% buffer A (5 mm ammonium formate, pH 3.3), 7 min up to 100% buffer B (5 mm ammonium formate, pH 3.3, 25% acetonitrile), holding at 100% buffer B for 1 min, returning to 100% buffer A in 1 min, and holding at 100% buffer A for 6 min. Flow rate was maintained at 0.75 ml/min, and temperature was fixed at 25 °C. Eluates containing NR (retention time, 4 min) were pooled, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. Purity was verified by HPLC analysis of 5 nmol of NR, after resuspension of the lyophilized sample in water and spectrophotometric quantitation (A259 = 4305 m−1 cm−1). U87 (human glioblastoma), A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), and PC3 (human prostate cancer) cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Ectocellular enzymatic activities of CD73 and CD38 were assayed by incubating 1 × 106 U87 and A549 intact cells in 0.6 ml of Hanks' buffered saline solution in the presence of the substrates AMP or NAD+ (0.4 mm). At various times (0, 1, 5, 30, and 120 min), 100-μl aliquots of the incubations were withdrawn and briefly centrifuged, and 2.5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to 90-μl supernatants. Samples were centrifuged, and the excess TCA was removed with diethylether. The amounts of nucleotides produced were determined by the phosphate HPLC analysis described previously (40.Garavaglia S.

J. 2012; 441: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Human recombinant CD38 (0.1 μg) was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 0.25 mm NAD+, NMN, or NR in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5. At various times (0, 0.5, 3, and 15 min), 100-μl aliquots were withdrawn, and enzymatic reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 50% (v/v) TCA. Controls without the enzyme were always processed in parallel to correct for non-enzymatic NAM generation. The products ADPR and NAM were analyzed and quantified by analytical phosphate HPLC (40.Garavaglia S. Bruzzone S. Cassani C. Canella L. Allegrone G. Sturla L. Mannino E. Millo E. De Flora A. Rizzi M.

After 24 h, culture medium was removed, and fresh medium, containing NAD+ at different concentrations (10, 3, or 1 μm), was added in different wells. Medium was collected in triplicate at different times (0, 10, 60, and 180 min), and perchloric acid (PCA) was added (0.6 m, final concentration).

https://openalex.org/W2033466292,"Variability of regenerative potential among animals has long perplexed biologists. On the basis of their exceptional regenerative abilities, planarians have become important models for understanding the molecular basis of regeneration. However, planarian species with limited regenerative abilities are also found. Despite the importance of understanding the differences between closely related, regenerating and non-regenerating organisms, few studies have focused on the evolutionary loss of regeneration, and the molecular mechanisms leading to such regenerative loss remain obscure. Here we examine Procotyla fluviatilis, a planarian with restricted ability to replace missing tissues, using next-generation sequencing to define the gene expression programs active in regeneration-permissive and regeneration-deficient tissues. We found that Wnt signalling is aberrantly activated in regeneration-deficient tissues. Notably, downregulation of canonical Wnt signalling in regeneration-deficient regions restores regenerative abilities: blastemas form and new heads regenerate in tissues that normally never regenerate. This work reveals that manipulating a single signalling pathway can reverse the evolutionary loss of regenerative potential."
https://openalex.org/W2162043650,"Telomerase plays a pivotal role in the pathology of aging and cancer by controlling telomere length and integrity. However, accumulating evidence indicates that telomerase reverse transcriptase may have fundamental biological functions independent of its enzymatic activity in telomere maintenance. In this study, the ectopic expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and its catalytic mutant hTERT K626A induced cancer cell invasion accompanied by the up-regulation of the metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP1, -3, -9, and -10. Both hTERT and hTERT K626A induced MMP9 mRNA expression and promoter activity in an NF-κB-dependent manner. hTERT and hTERT K626A also regulated the expression of several NF-κB target genes in cancer cell lines. Furthermore, both hTERT and hTERT K626A interacted with NF-κB p65 and increased NF-κB p65 nuclear accumulation and DNA binding. A mammalian 1-hybrid assay showed a functional interplay between hTERT and NF-κB p65 that may mediate NF-κB-dependent transcription activation in cells. Together, these data reveal a telomere-independent role for telomerase as a transcriptional modulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway and a possible contributor to cancer development and progression.—Ding, D., Xi, P., Zhou, J., Wang, M., Cong, Y.-S.

https://openalex.org/W2157252247,"Because little is known about the actions of botanical estrogens (BEs), widely consumed by menopausal women, we investigated the mechanistic and cellular activities of some major BEs. We examined the interactions of genistein, daidzein, equol, and liquiritigenin with estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, with key coregulators (SRC3 and RIP140) and chromatin binding sites, and the regulation of gene expression and proliferation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells containing ERα and/or ERβ. Unlike the endogenous estrogen, estradiol (E2), BEs preferentially bind to ERβ, but their ERβ-potency selectivity in gene stimulation (340- to 830-fold vs. E2) is enhanced at several levels (coregulator recruitment, chromatin binding); nevertheless, at high (0.1 or 1 μM) concentrations, BEs also fully activate ERα. Because ERα drives breast cancer cell proliferation and ERβ dampens this, the relative levels of these two ERs in target cells and the BE dose greatly affect gene expression and proliferative response and will be crucial determinants of the potential benefits vs. risks of BEs. Our findings reveal key and novel mechanistic differences in the estrogenic activities of BEs vs. E2, with BEs displaying patterns of activity distinctly different from those seen with E2 and provide valuable information to inform future studies.—Jiang, Y., Gong, P., Madak-Erdogan, Z., Martin, T., Jeyakumar, M., Carlson, K., Khan, I., Smillie, T.

https://openalex.org/W2018250477,"Selenium is an essential trace element that is co-translationally incorporated into selenoproteins in the form of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine. This class of proteins largely functions in oxidation-reduction reactions and is critically involved in maintaining proper redox balance essential to health. Selenoprotein M (SelM) is a thioredoxin-like endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein that is highly expressed in the brain and possesses neuroprotective properties. In this study, we first assessed the regional pattern of SelM expression in the mouse brain to provide insights into the potential functional implications of this protein in physiology and behavior. Next, we generated transgenic mice with a targeted deletion of the SelM gene and subjected them to a battery of neurobehavioral tests to evaluate motor coordination, locomotion, and cognitive function in comparison with wild-type controls. Finally, these mice were tested for several measures of metabolic function and body composition. Our results show that SelM knock-out (KO) mice display no deficits in measures of motor coordination and cognitive function but exhibit increased weight gain, elevated white adipose tissue deposition, and diminished hypothalamic leptin sensitivity. These findings suggest that SelM plays an important role in the regulation of body weight and energy metabolism."

In contrast, Notch activation in osteocytes increases bone mass, but the mechanisms involved and exact functions of Notch are not known. In this study, Notch1 and -2 were inactivated preferentially in osteocytes by mating Notch1/2 conditional mice, where Notch alleles are flanked by loxP sequences, with transgenics expressing Cre directed by the Dmp1 (dentin matrix protein 1) promoter. Notch1/2 conditional null male and female mice exhibited an increase in trabecular bone volume due to an increase in osteoblasts and decrease in osteoclasts. In male null mice, this was followed by an increase in osteoclast number and normalization of bone volume. To activate Notch preferentially in osteocytes, Dmp1-Cre transgenics were crossed with Rosa(Notch) mice, where a loxP-flanked STOP cassette is placed between the Rosa26 promoter and Notch1 intracellular domain sequences. Dmp1-Cre(+/-);Rosa(Notch) mice exhibited an increase in trabecular bone volume due to decreased bone resorption and an increase in cortical bone due to increased bone formation. Biomechanical and chemical properties were not affected. Osteoprotegerin mRNA was increased, sclerostin and dickkopf1 mRNA were decreased, and Wnt signaling was enhanced in Dmp1-Cre(+/-);Rosa(Notch) femurs. Botulinum toxin A-induced muscle paralysis caused pronounced osteopenia in control mice, but bone mass was preserved in mice harboring the Notch activation in osteocytes. In conclusion, Notch plays a unique role in osteocytes, up-regulates osteoprotegerin and Wnt signaling, and differentially regulates trabecular and cortical bone homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2028804272,"Bok is a member of the Bcl-2 protein family that controls intrinsic apoptosis. Bok is most closely related to the pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax, but in contrast to Bak and Bax, very little is known about its cellular role. Here we report that Bok binds strongly and constitutively to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), proteins that form tetrameric calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and govern the release of ER calcium stores. Bok binds most strongly to IP3R1 and IP3R2, and barely to IP3R3, and essentially all cellular Bok is IP3R bound in cells that express substantial amounts of IP3Rs. Binding to IP3Rs appears to be mediated by the putative BH4 domain of Bok and the docking site localizes to a small region within the coupling domain of IP3Rs (amino acids 1895-1903 of IP3R1) that is adjacent to numerous regulatory sites, including sites for proteolysis. With regard to the possible role of Bok-IP3R binding, the following was observed: (i) Bok does not appear to control the ability of IP3Rs to release ER calcium stores, (ii) Bok regulates IP3R expression, (iii) persistent activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent cell signaling causes Bok degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in a manner that parallels IP3R degradation, and (iv) Bok protects IP3Rs from proteolysis, either by chymotrypsin in vitro or by caspase-3 in vivo during apoptosis. Overall, these data show that Bok binds strongly and constitutively to IP3Rs and that the most significant consequence of this binding appears to be protection of IP3Rs from proteolysis. Thus, Bok may govern IP3R cleavage and activity during apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1988622942,"SAMHD1 (SAM domain- and HD domain-containing protein 1) is a dGTP-dependent dNTP triphosphohydrolase that converts dNTPs into deoxyribonucleosides and triphosphates. Therefore, SAMHD1 expression, particularly in non-dividing cells, can restrict retroviral infections such as HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus by limiting cellular dNTPs, which are essential for reverse transcription. It has previously been established that dGTP acts as both an activator and a substrate of this enzyme, suggesting that phosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1 is regulated by dGTP availability in the cell. However, we now demonstrate biochemically that the NTP GTP is equally capable of activating SAMHD1, but GTP is not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Activation of SAMHD1 phosphohydrolase activity was tested under physiological concentrations of dGTP or GTP found in either dividing or non-dividing cells. Because GTP is 1000-fold more abundant than dGTP in cells, GTP was able to activate the enzyme to a greater extent than dGTP, suggesting that GTP is the primary activator of SAMHD1. Finally, we show that SAMHD1 has the ability to hydrolyze base-modified nucleotides, indicating that the active site of SAMHD1 is not restrictive to such modifications, and is capable of regulating the levels of non-canonical dNTPs such as dUTP. This study provides further insights into the regulation of SAMHD1 with regard to allosteric activation and active site specificity."

The DNA-packaging nanomotor of tailed bacteriophages.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). DNA enters the viral head through a channel formed by a protein named connector that sits at a unique 5-fold vertex of the icosahedral capsid (2.Cuervo A. Carrascosa J.L. Viral connectors for DNA encapsulation.Curr. Opin.

The ordered packaged DNA generates a high pressure inside the viral head requiring the presence of protein complexes helping to retain the nucleic acid inside the capsid, probably by closing and/or securing the connector channel. In most of the dsDNA viruses, this task is accomplished by a protein or proteins that form a complex that builds a plug at the end of the portal channel, the so-called gatekeeper (3.Tavares P.

The tail is a protein complex present in the majority of bacteriophages, which is involved in host recognition and genome delivery. Three main morphologies have been described in tailed phages as follows: short and long noncontractile or long contractile corresponding to Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae families, respectively (4.Ackermann H.W. 5500 phages examined in the electron microscope.Arch.

The tail is attached to the head through the tail adaptor protein, a dodecameric ring with similarities to the gatekeeper proteins described for long-tailed phages (13.Olia A.S. Prevelige Jr., P.E.

The short length of the Podoviridae requires additional components to drill through the whole bacterial envelope, and it has been proposed to be enlarged by internal capsid proteins, which would be also ejected during infection (6.Casjens S.R.

Molineux I.J. Changes in bacteriophage T7 virion structure at the initiation of infection.Virology. 2005; 340: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been recently supported by a cryo-electron tomography study, which has defined for the first time a detailed description of the sequential steps involved in the interaction of the bacteriophage T7 with Escherichia coli (15.Hu B. Margolin W. Molineux I.J. Liu J. The bacteriophage t7 virion undergoes extensive structural remodeling during infection.Science. 2013; 339: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The bacteriophage T7 infects bacteria by interaction of the tail with one or more bacterial receptors, followed by DNA ejection, and accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of the tail structure (15.Hu B. Margolin W. Molineux I.J. Liu J. The bacteriophage t7 virion undergoes extensive structural remodeling during infection.Science. 2013; 339: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the limited resolution of previous studies from complete viral particles (16.Agirrezabala X. Martín-Benito J. Castón J.R. Miranda R. Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L.

Dualities in the analysis of phage DNA packaging motors.Bacteriophage. 2012; 2: 239-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has not yet identified the location and precise topology of the different proteins that constitute the tail structure. Biochemical studies have proposed that the T7 tail machine is formed by proteins gp7.3 (10 kDa), gp8 (59 kDa), gp11 (22 kDa), gp12 (89 kDa), and gp17 (61 kDa) (14.Kemp P. Garcia L.R. Molineux I.J. Changes in bacteriophage T7 virion structure at the initiation of infection.Virology. 2005; 340: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The best structurally characterized proteins are the connector (gp8) and the fibers (built by protein gp17). Purified gp8 protein has been shown to assemble as a dodecamer (18.Agirrezabala X. Martín-Benito J. Valle M. González J.M. Valencia A. Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L.

Proteins gp11 and gp12 have been proposed to form the central tubular structure of the tail, but their precise location remains unclear (14.Kemp P. Garcia L.R. Molineux I.J. Changes in bacteriophage T7 virion structure at the initiation of infection.Virology. 2005; 340: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, 32 subunits of the protein gp7.3 have been predicted as a component of the tail, but its location and function are controversial. This protein might be involved either in helping the tail protein assembly process or as a part of the tail channel or tip, thus contributing to the host cell interaction (6.Casjens S.R.

Molineux I.J. Changes in bacteriophage T7 virion structure at the initiation of infection.Virology. 2005; 340: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and it has also been proposed to be injected inside the bacteria during infection (14.Kemp P. Garcia L.R. Molineux I.J. Changes in bacteriophage T7 virion structure at the initiation of infection.Virology. 2005; 340: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The biochemical and structural studies carried out in this work have permitted us to define the location and oligomeric state of each of the proteins that form the tail of bacteriophage T7 and to understand their sequential assembly order into the mature DNA-filled viral heads. The genes 11 and 12 from T7 bacteriophage were amplified together or individually by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using forward and reverse primers containing the BglII-NcoI restriction sites, respectively, with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Applied Science). The fragments were then cloned into the pRSET-B plasmid (Invitrogen) using T4 ligase (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 16 °C. The T7 gene 8 was amplified using the same system with the primers containing the EcoRI-HindIII restriction sites, and it was then cloned into the pRSET-B plasmid containing the T7 11 and 12 genes. The gene 17, coding for the fiber protein, was amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers containing NcoI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, and cloned into the plasmid pCR2.1-TOPO using topoisomerase I from vaccinia virus (TOPO TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). The fragment coding for the gp17 fiber gene was excised using the aforementioned restriction enzymes and cloned into the expression vector pETDuet (Novagen, Merck Millipore) using the same sites. Bacteriophage T7 was produced as described previously (22.Fumagalli L. Esteban-Ferrer D. Cuervo A. Carrascosa J.L. Gomila G. Label-free identification of single dielectric nanoparticles and viruses with ultraweak polarization forces.Nat. Mater. 2012; 11: 808-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly E. coli BL21 strain was infected with wild type phage, and the lysate was purified in a cesium chloride step gradient (23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y1989: 74-76Google Scholar) and dialyzed using VISKING dialysis tubing (SERVA) on 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl (TMS buffer). The tail complexes were obtained by incubating the T7 viruses in the presence of 100 mm EDTA and complete antiproteases mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 45 min at 65 °C. The complexes were complemented with 20 mm MgCl2, incubated with 10 μg/ml DNase (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C, and pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 213,000 × g for 3 h. The complexes were resuspended in TMS buffer, loaded onto a 10–40% sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 148,000 × g for 105 min. The enriched fractions were concentrated using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter units (Millipore) and loaded onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL column for size exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare). The sample purity was checked by SDS-PAGE as described previously (14.Kemp P. Garcia L.R. Molineux I.J. Changes in bacteriophage T7 virion structure at the initiation of infection.Virology. 2005; 340: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The plasmid coding for the gp8, gp11, and gp12 proteins (8-11-12 complex) was transformed into the E. coli C41 strain. The culture was grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.6 measured at 600 nm (A600), and then protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The culture was harvested, and the 8-11-12 complexes were found in the supernatant, which was supplemented with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The complex was precipitated overnight at 4 °C by addition of ammonium sulfate to a final saturation of 40% and pelleted at 6500 × g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in TMS buffer or 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl containing 10 mm imidazole (no differences were observed between the two buffers). The 8-11-12 complexes, His-tagged at the N-terminal side of gp11 protein, were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Cobalt TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) and eluted at 1 m imidazole. The enriched eluted fractions were then concentrated on Amicon ultracentrifugal filter units (Millipore) and loaded onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL column as described above. The purity of the samples was checked by SDS-PAGE as described previously (14.Kemp P. Garcia L.R. Molineux I.J. Changes in bacteriophage T7 virion structure at the initiation of infection.Virology. 2005; 340: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). gp8 protein purification was described previously (24.Daudén M.I. Martín-Benito J. Sánchez-Ferrero J.C. Pulido-Cid M. Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Large terminase conformational change induced by connector binding in bacteriophage T7.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 16998-17007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The plasmids coding for gp11 or gp12 were transformed into E. coli C41 strain and grown as described above. The cultures were harvested and resuspended into buffer 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min. gp12 was precipitated overnight at 4 °C by addition of ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 40%, pelleted at 25,000 × g for 15 min, and resuspended in the same buffer. The N-terminal His-tagged proteins were purified in a TALON affinity resin as described above and eluted at 1 m imidazole. gp11 protein was pure enough after this step; gp12 protein was dialyzed in buffer 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and purified into an ion exchange chromatography on a ResourceQ column (GE Healthcare), where the protein was eluted at 250 mm NaCl. The purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE. To study its oligomerization state, gp11 was loaded into a Superdex 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) column for size exclusion chromatography. Bovine albumin, ovalbumin, anhydric carbonase, and cytochrome c were used as protein markers. gp17 fiber protein was produced in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). The culture was grown at 37 °C up to an A600 between 0.6 and 0.8, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for 16 h at 16 °C. Harvested cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 4% glycerol, 50 mm ammonium chloride, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm sodium chloride and then frozen at −20 °C. The cells were lysed by several freezing and thawing cycles and centrifuged to eliminate cell debris. A one-to-one culture volume ratio of the gp17 extract was mixed with 8-11-12 complexes after the ammonium sulfate precipitation step (see above) and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and mixed with TALON resin (as described above). The 8-11-12 complexes that have incorporated gp17 protein did not bind to the resin and were eluted during the washes. The sample was then precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 40% saturation, pelleted for 15 min at 25,000 × g, and loaded onto a 10–40% sucrose gradient and centrifuged, followed by size exclusion chromatography as described above. gp17 protein was purified following the same protocol. For production of gp8 antibodies, nine BALB/c mice were inoculated in three cycles with 780 μg of purified His-tagged gp8 protein (Protein Tools Unit). Protein G Dynabeads (Novex by Invitrogen) were coated with gp8 antibodies following the manufacturer's instructions. The gp8-gp11 interaction reactions were performed at 1:1 or 1:0.5 μm ratios and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C in TMS buffer. The reactions were then incubated with anti-gp8-coated beads and washed following the manufacturer's instructions. The bound complexes were boiled at 99 °C for 5 min, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting, incubated with anti-His antibody (Sigma), and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, GE Healthcare). Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples was performed as described previously (18.Agirrezabala X. Martín-Benito J. Valle M. González J.M. Valencia A. Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L.

Biol. 2005; 347: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). gp12 images were acquired on an FEI Tecnai FEG200 electron microscope operated at 200 kV, using low dose protocols with a 4K × 4K Eagle CCD camera (Gatan Inc.) at a nominal magnification of ×108,696 and a defocus range of 1.5–3.5 μm. The contrast transfer function was corrected in the micrographs using standard XMIPP software (25.Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Sorzano C.O. Carazo J.M. Marabini R. Image processing for electron microscopy single-particle analysis using XMIPP.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 977-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar); the particles were manually selected with XMIPP (26.Sorzano C.O. Marabini R. Velázquez-Muriel J. Bilbao-Castro J.R. Scheres S.H. Carazo J.M. Pascual-Montano A. XMIPP: a new generation of an open-source image processing package for electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and down-sampled to a factor of 3 to a final pixel size ratio of 4.14 Å/pixel. Images were classified using XMIPP reference-free clustering approach classification methods (CL2D) (27.Sorzano C.O. Bilbao-Castro J.R. Shkolnisky Y. Alcorlo M. Melero R. Caffarena-Fernández G. Li M. Xu G. Marabini R. Carazo J.M. A clustering approach to multireference alignment of single-particle projections in electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 171: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and 640 particles corresponding to side views were selected. A Gaussian blob was used as a starting model to perform a three-dimensional reconstruction using a restricted projection angle protocol with EMAN (28.Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. EMAN: semiautomated software for high-resolution single-particle reconstructions.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Next the model was refined using XMIPP Projection Matching package (25.Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Sorzano C.O. Carazo J.M. Marabini R. Image processing for electron microscopy single-particle analysis using XMIPP.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 977-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). For cryo-electron microscopy, the samples were applied to Quantifoil 2-μm holey carbon grids coated with a thin carbon layer, frozen in liquid ethane, and transferred to a FEI Tecnai FEG200 operated as described above. Tail complex images were acquired at a nominal magnification of ×50,000, and the selected micrographs were scanned on a Zeiss scanner (Zeiss SCAI scanner) with a step size of 7 μm. The images of the 8-11-12 complexes were acquired under the same conditions but using a 4K × 4K Eagle CCD camera at a nominal magnification of ×108,696. Next, images were contrast transfer function-corrected (25.Scheres S.H. Núñez-Ramírez R. Sorzano C.O. Carazo J.M. Marabini R. Image processing for electron microscopy single-particle analysis using XMIPP.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 977-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and down-sampled by a factor of 2 to a final pixel size ratio of 2.8 and 2.75 Å/pixel for the tail and the 8-11-12 complex, respectively. To perform the three-dimensional reconstructions, 3056 and 1820 particles of the tail and the 8-11-12 complex, respectively, were extracted, normalized, and two-dimensionally aligned and classified using reference-free XMIPP maximum likelihood (ML2D) (29.Scheres S.H. Valle M. Carazo J.M. Fast maximum-likelihood refinement of electron microscopy images.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 243-244Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and CL2D (27.Sorzano C.O.

Averages resulting from these classifications were used to generate an initial three-dimensional model based on the common line methods implemented in the EMAN software (28.Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. EMAN: semiautomated software for high-resolution single-particle reconstructions.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar) applying 6-fold symmetry. These initial models were refined using SPIDER (30.Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. SPIDER and WEB: processing and visualization of images in 3D electron microscopy and related fields.J. Struct.

Image processing for electron microscopy single-particle analysis using XMIPP.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 977-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The final resolutions using the 0.3 Fourier shell correlation criterion were ∼16 Å for the tail complex and ∼12 Å for the 8-11-12 complex. Three-dimensional volumes and images were generated with the University of California at San Francisco Chimera software (31.Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C.

Appropriate templates for model building of portal protein gp8 were found with HHpred (32.Söding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. The HHpred interactive server for protein homology detection and structure prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). These corresponded to the enterobacteriophage P22 connector protein (E-value 5.5E-05, p value 2E-09, 10% identity) and the bacteriophage SPP1 portal protein (E-value 0.18, p value 5.4E-10, 12% identity). The final structural model of gp8 was built with I-TASSER (33.Zhang Y. I-TASSER server for protein 3D structure prediction.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (3870) Google Scholar), using the fully automatic procedure. Alignment of gp8 with P22 connector protein was produced by I-TASSER. Structural templates for gp11 were assessed with several sequence-based and threading algorithms providing no significant output. In the absence of a clear template for gp11, a sequence profile was created and further used to search against the InterPro database (34.Hunter S. Jones P. Mitchell A. Apweiler R. Attwood T.K.

https://openalex.org/W1972455024,"β-Glucosidase 2 (GBA2) is an enzyme that cleaves the membrane lipid glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide. The GBA2 gene is mutated in genetic neurological diseases (hereditary spastic paraplegia and cerebellar ataxia). Pharmacologically, GBA2 is reversibly inhibited by alkylated imino sugars that are in clinical use or are being developed for this purpose. We have addressed the ambiguity surrounding one of the defining characteristics of GBA2, which is its sensitivity to inhibition by conduritol B epoxide (CBE). We found that CBE inhibited GBA2, in vitro and in live cells, in a time-dependent fashion, which is typical for mechanism-based enzyme inactivators. Compared with the well characterized impact of CBE on the lysosomal glucosylceramide-degrading enzyme (glucocerebrosidase, GBA), CBE inactivated GBA2 less efficiently, due to a lower affinity for this enzyme (higher KI) and a lower rate of enzyme inactivation (k(inact)). In contrast to CBE, N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin exclusively inhibited GBA2. Accordingly, we propose to redefine GBA2 activity as the β-glucosidase that is sensitive to inhibition by N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin. Revised as such, GBA2 activity 1) was optimal at pH 5.5-6.0; 2) accounted for a much higher proportion of detergent-independent membrane-associated β-glucosidase activity; 3) was more variable among mouse tissues and neuroblastoma and monocyte cell lines; and 4) was more sensitive to inhibition by N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (miglustat, Zavesca®), in comparison with earlier studies. Our evaluation of GBA2 makes it possible to assess its activity more accurately, which will be helpful in analyzing its physiological roles and involvement in disease and in the pharmacological profiling of monosaccharide mimetics."
https://openalex.org/W1972426718,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and p53 are pivotal regulators of tumor growth. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lipid mediator that functions as a mitogen by acting through LPA receptors. We have shown previously that LPA stimulates HIF-1α expression in colon cancer cells. To determine the mechanism of HIF-1α induction by LPA, we compared the effect of LPA on HIF-1α in several colon cancer cell lines. LPA transcriptionally induced HIF-1α in colon cancer cells. HIF-1α induction was observed in cells expressing WT p53, where LPA decreased p53 expression. However, LPA failed to induce HIF-1α when the p53 gene was mutated. A decrease in p53 expression was dependent on induction of p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 by LPA. Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is an effector of LPA-induced proliferation of colon cancer cells. Because HIF-1α was necessary for LPA-induced growth of colon cancer cells, we determined the relationship between KLF5 and HIF-1α by a loss-of-function approach. Silencing of KLF5 inhibited LPA-induced HIF-1α induction, suggesting that KLF5 is an upstream regulator of HIF-1α. KLF5 and p53 binding to the Hif1α promoter was assessed by ChIP assay. LPA increased the occupancy of the Hif1α promoter by KLF5, while decreasing p53 binding. Transfection of HCT116 cells with KLF5 or p53 attenuated the binding of the other transcription factor. These results identify KLF5 as a transactivator of HIF-1α and show that LPA regulates HIF-1α by dynamically modulating its interaction with KLF5 and p53."
https://openalex.org/W2081540048,"A barrier to eradicating HIV infection is targeting and eliminating latently infected cells. Events that contribute to HIV transcriptional latency include repressive chromatin structure, transcriptional interference, the inability of Tat to recruit positive transcription factor b, and poor processivity of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). In this study, we investigated mechanisms by which negative elongation factor (NELF) establishes and maintains HIV latency. Negative elongation factor (NELF) induces RNAP II promoter proximal pausing and limits provirus expression in HIV-infected primary CD4(+) T cells. Decreasing NELF expression overcomes RNAP II pausing to enhance HIV transcription elongation in infected primary T cells, demonstrating the importance of pausing in repressing HIV transcription. We also show that RNAP II pausing is coupled to premature transcription termination and chromatin remodeling. NELF interacts with Pcf11, a transcription termination factor, and diminishing Pcf11 in primary CD4(+) T cells induces HIV transcription elongation. In addition, we identify NCoR1-GPS2-HDAC3 as a NELF-interacting corepressor complex that is associated with repressed HIV long terminal repeats. We propose a model in which NELF recruits Pcf11 and NCoR1-GPS2-HDAC3 to paused RNAP II, reinforcing repression of HIV transcription and establishing a critical checkpoint for HIV transcription and latency."

We apply this approach to generate a bispecific antibody that targets IL-4 and IL-13, two cytokines that play roles in type 2 inflammation. We show that IgG4 bispecific antibodies can be generated in large quantities with equivalent efficiency and quality and have comparable pharmacokinetic properties and lung partitioning, compared with the IgG1 isotype. This work broadens the range of published therapeutic bispecific antibodies with natural surface architecture and provides additional options for the generation of bispecific antibodies with differing effector functions through the use of different antibody isotypes.Background: Dual neutralization of IL-4 and IL-13 is a promising therapeutic approach for asthma and allergy.Results: Knobs-into-holes IgG1 and IgG4 bispecific antibodies targeting both cytokines were developed.Conclusion: Bispecific antibodies of both isotypes have comparable in vitro potencies, in vivo pharmacokinetics, and lung partitioning.Significance: Further extension of knobs-into-holes technology to human IgG4 isotype as reported here provides greater options for therapeutics. Human bispecific antibodies have great potential for the treatment of human diseases.

A fraction of toxin also moves from endosomes across the cell to the basolateral plasma membrane by transcytosis, thus breeching the intestinal barrier. Here we find that sorting of cholera toxin into this transcytotic pathway bypasses retrograde transport to the TGN. We also find that GM1 sphingolipids can traffic from apical to basolateral membranes by transcytosis in the absence of toxin binding but only if the GM1 species contain cis-unsaturated or short acyl chains in the ceramide domain.

https://openalex.org/W2062961514,"Pannexin1 (Panx1) is a plasma membrane channel permeable to relatively large molecules, such as ATP. In the central nervous system (CNS) Panx1 is found in neurons and glia and in the immune system in macrophages and T-cells. We tested the hypothesis that Panx1-mediated ATP release contributes to expression of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, using wild-type (WT) and Panx1 knockout (KO) mice. Panx1 KO mice displayed a delayed onset of clinical signs of EAE and decreased mortality compared to WT mice, but developed as severe symptoms as the surviving WT mice. Spinal cord inflammatory lesions were also reduced in Panx1 KO EAE mice during acute disease. Additionally, pharmacologic inhibition of Panx1 channels with mefloquine (MFQ) reduced severity of acute and chronic EAE when administered before or after onset of clinical signs. ATP release and YoPro uptake were significantly increased in WT mice with EAE as compared to WT non-EAE and reduced in tissues of EAE Panx1 KO mice. Interestingly, we found that the P2X7 receptor was upregulated in the chronic phase of EAE in both WT and Panx1 KO spinal cords. Such increase in receptor expression is likely to counterbalance the decrease in ATP release recorded from Panx1 KO mice and thus contribute to the development of EAE symptoms in these mice. The present study shows that a Panx1 dependent mechanism (ATP release and/or inflammasome activation) contributes to disease progression, and that inhibition of Panx1 using pharmacology or gene disruption delays and attenuates clinical signs of EAE."
https://openalex.org/W2070807787,"T cell receptor (TCR)-initiated signal transduction is reported to increase production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide (O2˙(-)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as second messengers. Although H2O2 can modulate signal transduction by inactivating protein phosphatases, the mechanism and the subcellular localization of intracellular H2O2 as a second messenger of the TCR are not known. The antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalyzes the dismutation of highly reactive O2˙(-) into H2O2 and thus acts as an intracellular generator of H2O2. As charged O2˙(-) is unable to diffuse through intracellular membranes, cells express distinct SOD isoforms in the cytosol (Cu,Zn-SOD) and mitochondria (Mn-SOD), where they locally scavenge O2˙(-) leading to production of H2O2. A 2-fold organelle-specific overexpression of either SOD in Jurkat T cell lines increases intracellular production of H2O2 but does not alter the levels of intracellular H2O2 scavenging enzymes such as catalase, membrane-bound peroxiredoxin1 (Prx1), and cytosolic Prx2. We report that overexpression of Mn-SOD enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR-associated membrane proximal signal transduction molecules Lck, LAT, ZAP70, PLCγ1, and SLP76 within 1 min of TCR cross-linking. This increase in mitochondrial H2O2 specifically modulates MAPK signaling through the JNK/cJun pathway, whereas overexpressing Cu,Zn-SOD had no effect on any of these TCR-mediated signaling molecules. As mitochondria translocate to the immunological synapse during TCR activation, we hypothesize this translocation provides the effective concentration of H2O2 required to selectively modulate downstream signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2013000069,"CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a ubiquitously expressed ""master weaver"" and plays multiple functions in the genome, including transcriptional activation/repression, chromatin insulation, imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and high-order chromatin organization. It has been shown that CTCF facilitates the recruitment of the upstream binding factor onto ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and regulates the local epigenetic state of rDNA repeats. However, the mechanism by which CTCF modulates rRNA gene transcription has not been well understood. Here we found that wild-type CTCF augments the pre-rRNA level, cell size, and cell growth in cervical cancer cells. In contrast, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CTCF reduced pre-rRNA transcription. CTCF positively regulates rRNA gene transcription in a RNA polymerase I-dependent manner. We identified an RRGR motif as a putative nucleolar localization sequence in the C-terminal region of CTCF that is required for activating rRNA gene transcription. Using mass spectrometry, we identified SMC2 and SMC4, two subunits of condensin complexes that interact with CTCF. Condensin negatively regulates CTCF-mediated rRNA gene transcription. Knockdown of SMC2 expression significantly facilitates the loading of CTCF and the upstream binding factor onto the rDNA locus and increases histone acetylation across the rDNA locus. Taken together, our study suggests that condensin competes with CTCF in binding to a specific rDNA locus and negatively regulates CTCF-mediated rRNA gene transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2025639301,"Metabolic reprogramming is a pathological feature of cancer and a driver of tumor cell transformation. N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) is one of the most abundant amino acid derivatives in the brain and serves as a source of metabolic acetate for oligodendrocyte myelination and protein/histone acetylation or a precursor for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG). NAA and NAAG as well as aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA degradation, are significantly reduced in glioma tumors, suggesting a possible role for decreased acetate metabolism in tumorigenesis. This study sought to examine the effects of NAA and NAAG on primary tumor-derived glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) from oligodendroglioma as well as proneural and mesenchymal glioblastoma, relative to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (Oli-Neu). Although the NAA dicarboxylate transporter NaDC3 is primarily thought to be expressed by astrocytes, all cell lines expressed NaDC3 and, thus, are capable of NAA up-take. Treatment with NAA or NAAG significantly increased GSC growth and suppressed differentiation of Oli-Neu cells and proneural GSCs. Interestingly, ASPA was expressed in both the cytosol and nuclei of GSCs and exhibited greatest nuclear immunoreactivity in differentiation-resistant GSCs. Both NAA and NAAG elicited the expression of a novel immunoreactive ASPA species in select GSC nuclei, suggesting differential ASPA regulation in response to these metabolites. Therefore, this study highlights a potential role for nuclear ASPA expression in GSC malignancy and suggests that the use of NAA or NAAG is not an appropriate therapeutic approach to increase acetate bioavailability in glioma. Thus, an alternative acetate source is required."
https://openalex.org/W2083069367,"Eosinophil accumulation is a characteristic feature of the immune response to parasitic worms and allergens. The cell surface carbohydrate-binding receptor Siglec-F is highly expressed on eosinophils and negatively regulates their accumulation during inflammation. Although endogenous ligands for Siglec-F have yet to be biochemically defined, binding studies using glycan arrays have implicated galactose 6-O-sulfate (Gal6S) as a partial recognition determinant for this receptor. Only two sulfotransferases are known to generate Gal6S, namely keratan sulfate galactose 6-O-sulfotransferase (KSGal6ST) and chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (C6ST-1). Here we use mice deficient in both KSGal6ST and C6ST-1 to determine whether these sulfotransferases are required for the generation of endogenous Siglec-F ligands. First, we characterize ligand expression on leukocyte populations and find that ligands are predominantly expressed on cell types also expressing Siglec-F, namely eosinophils, neutrophils, and alveolar macrophages. We also detect Siglec-F ligand activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid fractions containing polymeric secreted mucins, including MUC5B. Consistent with these observations, ligands in the lung increase dramatically during infection with the parasitic nematode, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, which is known to induce eosinophil accumulation and mucus production. Surprisingly, Gal6S is undetectable in sialylated glycans from eosinophils and BAL fluid analyzed by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, none of the ligands we describe are diminished in mice lacking KSGal6ST and C6ST-1, indicating that neither of the known galactose 6-O-sulfotransferases is required for ligand synthesis. These results establish that ligands for Siglec-F are present on several cell types that are relevant during allergic lung inflammation and argue against the widely held view that Gal6S is critical for glycan recognition by this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1974351333,"Macroautophagy is an essential, homeostatic process involving degradation of a cell's own components; it plays a role in catabolizing cellular components, such as protein or lipids, and damaged or excess organelles. Here, we show that in Atg5(-/-) cells, sialyloligosaccharides specifically accumulated in the cytosol. Accumulation of these glycans was observed under non-starved conditions, suggesting that non-induced, basal autophagy is essential for their catabolism. Interestingly, once accumulated in the cytosol, sialylglycans cannot be efficiently catabolized by resumption of the autophagic process, suggesting that functional autophagy is important for preventing sialyloligosaccharides from accumulating in the cytosol. Moreover, knockdown of sialin, a lysosomal transporter of sialic acids, resulted in a significant reduction of sialyloligosaccharides, implying that autophagy affects the substrate specificity of this transporter. This study thus provides a surprising link between basal autophagy and catabolism of N-linked glycans."

While the two subunits were redundant in many vma phenotypes, such as alkaline pH sensitivity, calcium homeostasis, respiratory defects, and cell wall integrity, we observed a unique contribution of VPH1. Specifically, vph1Δ was defective in acidification of the vacuole and its dependent functions, such as metal ion sequestration as evidenced by hypersensitivity to Zn2+ toxicity, whereas stv1Δ resembled wild type. In growth conditions that elicit morphogenic switching, vph1Δ was defective in forming hyphae whereas stv1Δ was normal or only modestly impaired.

Signaling pathways that drive immature thymic progenitors to differentiate into CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ nTreg cells need to be elucidated. The precise role of the TSC1/2 complex, a critical negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), in thymic CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ nTreg-cell develop ment remains elusive. In the present study, we found that the percentage and cell number of thymic CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ nTreg cells were significantly increased in T-cell-specific TSC1-knockout (TSC1KO) mice. Nevertheless, the levels of CD4+CD25+Foxp3– nTreg precursors in TSC1KO thymus were indistinguishable from those in wild-type mice. TSC1KO CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ nTreg cells showed normal cell death but enhanced proliferative response to IL-2 in a STAT5-dependent manner. Rapamycin (Rapa) treatment failed to rescue but rather increased the frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ nTreg cells in TSC1KO and RictorKO mice. The percentage and cell number of thymic CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ nTreg cells were significantly increased in T-cell-specific RictorKO mice but not in PtenKO mice.

Post-translational modification of proteins, including phosphorylation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, and methylation, represents key mechanisms that cells use to respond to environmental changes and to modulate protein function. An additional layer of protein regulation is the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins, a process called ubiquitination. Although ubiquitination commonly signals for protein degradation by the proteasome machinery, it can also lead to other nondegradative pathways, including DNA repair, cellular trafficking, chromatin remodeling, and immune responses (1.Husnjak K. Dikic I. Ubiquitin-binding proteins. Decoders of ubiquitin-mediated cellular functions.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 291-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid globular protein that can be attached as a single unit (monoubiquitination), conjugated to multiple sites in the target protein (multi-monoubiquitination), or attached as a polyubiquitin chain. Monoubiquitination leads to the conjugation of a single ubiquitin molecule onto one or more lysine residues on the target proteins' surface. Polymerization of ubiquitin occurs by conjugation of any of the ϵ-amino groups on the seven surface lysine residues or the N-terminal methionine to the C-terminal glycine (2.Ikeda F. Crosetto N. Dikic I. What determines the specificity and outcomes of ubiquitin signaling?.Cell. 2010; 143: 677-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, ubiquitin is recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains (also known as ubiquitin receptors), which translate ubiquitinated target signals into cell signaling cascades. Over 20 distinct ubiquitin-binding domains associate noncovalently with ubiquitin moieties with affinities in the micromolar range (1.Husnjak K. Dikic I. Ubiquitin-binding proteins. Decoders of ubiquitin-mediated cellular functions.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 291-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), which can be explained by the fact that the intracellular ubiquitin concentration can be as high as 85 μm (3.Kaiser S.E. Riley B.E. Shaler T.A. Trevino R.S. Becker C.H. Schulman H. Kopito R.R. Protein standard absolute quantification (PSAQ) method for the measurement of cellular ubiquitin pools.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The majority of the ubiquitin-binding domains bind to ubiquitin through a hydrophobic patch in which the Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 residues of ubiquitin play critical roles (4.Dikic I. Wakatsuki S. Walters K.J. Ubiquitin-binding domains. From structures to functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-binding domains are structurally classified in α-helical, zinc fingers, pleckstrin homology folds, and ubiquitin-conjugating-like domains (1.Husnjak K. Dikic I. Ubiquitin-binding proteins. Decoders of ubiquitin-mediated cellular functions.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 291-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to endosomal reticulum degradation (CUE), GGA and Tom1 (GAT), and Vps27/Hrs/Stam (VHS) domains belong to the helical subfamily of ubiquitin-binding domains (1.Husnjak K. Dikic I. Ubiquitin-binding proteins. Decoders of ubiquitin-mediated cellular functions.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 291-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the ubiquitin backbone is rigid (with the exception of its C terminus), association of ubiquitin-binding domains leads to conformational changes in ubiquitin (5.Lange O.F. Lakomek N.A. Farès C. Schröder G.F. Walter K.F. Becker S. Meiler J. Grubmüller H. Griesinger C. de Groot B.L. Recognition dynamics up to microseconds revealed from an RDC-derived ubiquitin ensemble in solution.Science. 2008; 320: 1471-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-binding domains display more selectivity and bind more tightly to certain types of polyubiquitinated chains, in which these polymers can adopt packed or extended conformations depending on what lysine residues link ubiquitin chains (reviewed in Ref. 1.Husnjak K. Dikic I. Ubiquitin-binding proteins. Decoders of ubiquitin-mediated cellular functions.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 291-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Several ubiquitin-binding domains have been shown to mediate intra-monoubiquitination, leading to a ubiquitin-binding domain-containing protein conformation that exhibits altered function and localization and likely alters its interactions with ubiquitinated cargo during endosomal trafficking (reviewed in Ref. 6.Haglund K. Dikic I. The role of ubiquitylation in receptor endocytosis and endosomal sorting.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To control cellular processes, cells dampen signaling through a broad range of mechanisms including cargo internalization. The mechanism of cargo removal includes its internalization by endocytosis, followed by ubiquitin-mediated delivery to early endosomes, where cargo sorting takes place (7.Cullen P.J. Endosomal sorting and signalling. An emerging role for sorting nexins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Cargo is further sorted into intralumenal vesicles of late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. Alternatively, some cargo is retrieved from this pathway. Once all the retrieved molecules have been removed, late endosomes/multivesicular bodies fuse with lysosomes leading to cargo degradation in the vesicular lumen (8.Saftig P. Klumperman J. Lysosome biogenesis and lysosomal membrane proteins. Trafficking meets function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Adaptor proteins regulate protein sorting by interacting with different macromolecules at the surface of endosomal membranes. The function of many adaptor proteins is associated with their ubiquitin-binding domains, ensuring the precise sorting of ubiquitinated cargo proteins inside the intralumenal endosomal vesicles. One of these adaptor proteins is Tollip, which is involved in protein sorting by association with Tom1, ubiquitin, and clathrin (9.Yamakami M. Yoshimori T. Yokosawa H.

Tollip is primarily localized on early endosomes where it is required for degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated cargo (10.Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Mitsuhashi H. Yanagida Y. Takatsu H. Nakayama K.

Negative regulation of Toll-like receptor-mediated signaling by Tollip.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). By binding to IRAK proteins, Tollip indirectly regulates the function of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor (NF)-κB, to influence the expression of innate immune-related genes, such as those that codify for cytokines and interferons (15.Kawai T. Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity. Update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6230) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tollip has been shown to be sumoylated and mediates IL-1R sumoylation (16.Ciarrocchi A. D'Angelo R. Cordiglieri C. Rispoli A. Santi S. Riccio M. Carone S. Mancia A.L. Paci S. Cipollini E. Ambrosetti D. Melli M. Tollip is a mediator of protein sumoylation.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), placing Tollip as a modulator of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein trafficking. Tollip is modular with a Tom1-binding domain (TBD), a conserved 2 (C2) domain, and a CUE domain (17.Capelluto D.G. Tollip. A multitasking protein in innate immunity and protein trafficking.Microbes Infect. 2012; 14: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Tollip TBD associates with the Tom1 GAT domain to facilitate membrane trafficking (10.Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Mitsuhashi H. Yanagida Y. Takatsu H. Nakayama K. Tollip and Tom1 form a complex and recruit ubiquitin-conjugated proteins onto early endosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24435-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the C2 domain of Tollip preferentially binds phosphoinositides, particularly PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (18.Ankem G. Mitra S. Sun F. Moreno A.C. Chutvirasakul B. Azurmendi H.F. Li L. Capelluto D.G. The C2 domain of Tollip, a Toll-like receptor signalling regulator, exhibits broad preference for phosphoinositides.Biochem. J. 2011; 435: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, Tollip likely acts in the recruitment of several proteins on the endosomes via PtdIns(3)P (for membrane trafficking) and the plasma membrane via PtdIns(4,5)P2 (e.g. for Toll-like receptor signaling regulation). The Tollip CUE domain is a ubiquitin-binding module (19.Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. A ubiquitin-binding motif required for intramolecular monoubiquitylation, the CUE domain.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) that has been shown to bind to and be phosphorylated by IRAK proteins (14.Zhang G. Ghosh S. Negative regulation of Toll-like receptor-mediated signaling by Tollip.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). As observed for the yeast Vps9p CUE domain (20.Prag G. Misra S. Jones E.A. Ghirlando R. Davies B.A. Horazdovsky B.F. Hurley J.H. Mechanism of ubiquitin recognition by the CUE domain of Vps9p.Cell. 2003; 113: 609-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the human Tollip CUE domain forms tight dimers (21.Azurmendi H.F. Mitra S. Ayala I. Li L. Finkielstein C.V. Capelluto D.G. Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary structure of the Tollip CUE domain.Mol. Cells. 2010; 30: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which can contribute to Tollip oligomerization and ligand recognition. Most of the ubiquitin-binding domains mediate intramolecular interactions; however, it has not yet been demonstrated whether CUE domains exert such regulatory functions (6.Haglund K. Dikic I. The role of ubiquitylation in receptor endocytosis and endosomal sorting.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).

Here, we provide detailed structural insights into Tollip-ubiquitin complex formation. We demonstrate that ubiquitin binding to Tollip disrupts Tollip-phosphoinositide interactions. In addition to the Tollip CUE domain, we identify the Tollip C2 domain as a novel ubiquitin-binding domain. By comparison, Tollip C2 and CUE domains bind ubiquitin in partially overlapping sites with moderate affinity, with the Tollip C2 domain showing an extensive contact surface, whereas the corresponding site for the CUE domain is mapped on an exposed hydrophobic patch around Ile-44. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the dimeric Tollip CUE domain dissociates when bound to ubiquitin. Based on our findings, we propose that ubiquitin binds to two independent sites in Tollip, an association that promotes dissociation of the Tollip CUE domain dimers, and direct inhibition of PtdIns(3)P ligation, leading to membrane release of adaptor protein complexes in the absence of polyubiquitinated cargo. 1,2-Dioleyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphocholine (PtdCho), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PtdEth), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) were from Avanti Polar Lipids; PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 were from Echelon Biosciences. All other chemicals were analytical reagent grade. The cloning, expression, and purification of human Tollip and the isolated C2 (residues 54–182) and CUE (residues 223–278) domains as GST fusions and untagged proteins were carried out as previously reported (18.Ankem G.

Purified His-tagged rat PKCα C2 domain and a rat cDNA that codifies for PKCβ II C2 domain, cloned into the pGEX4T1 vector, were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Stahelin (University of Notre Dame). The cDNA of human ubiquitin, cloned into the pET24d vector, was a generous gift from Dr. Julie Forman-Kay (University of Toronto). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange (Stratagene). Ubiquitin constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta strain (Stratagene). Ubiquitin was generated in Luria-Bertani media, whereas the 15N-labeled form was produced in minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory Inc.) as the source of nitrogen. Induction of the His-tagged fusion ubiquitin was performed by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the bacterial cell culture at an OD of ∼0.8 followed by a 2-h incubation at 25 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in ice-cold equilibrium buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml of lysozyme, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 8.6 μg/ml of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 4.3 μg/ml of 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 0.15 μg/ml of aprotinin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Suspension was further processed by sonication and centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was incubated with Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech). In some cases, fusion proteins were eluted off the beads by the addition of a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8), 1 m NaCl, and 200 mm imidazole. For untagged protein purifications, His tag was removed by incubation of the fusion protein with tobacco etch virus protease in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA at room temperature for 3 days. Proteins were recovered in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, and concentrated using a 3-kDa cut-off concentrator device (Millipore) and further purified by an ÄKTA FPLC system using a Superdex 30 column (GE Healthcare), previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Protein concentrations were calculated using the BCA method. Purity of proteins was over 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses and by their identity using N-terminal sequencing (Tufts University). Stocks of PtdIns(3)P, PtdCho, and PtdEth, were prepared in organic solvents using chloroform:methanol:water (65:35:8). PtdIns(3)P liposomes were prepared by weight ratio of 1:1 of PtdCho:PtdEth and 10% PtdIns(3)P. Control liposomes contained 1:1 of PtdCho:PtdEth. Lipid films were generated in a dessicator overnight and hydrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 100 mm NaCl to 1 mg/ml at 60 °C for 1 h. Liposomes were sonicated, pelleted, and suspended at 2.5 mg/ml in the same buffer and then subjected to extrusion at 60 °C using 400-nm membranes and immediately used for SPR experiments. Lipid strips were prepared by spotting 1 μl of the indicated amount of PtdIns(3)P dissolved in chloroform/methanol/water (65:35:8) onto Hybond-C extra membranes (GE Healthcare). Membrane strips containing the immobilized PtdIns(3)P were blocked with 3% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. In some cases, GST fusion proteins were preincubated with 2–4-fold excess molar ratios of ubiquitin. Then, membranes were incubated with ubiquitin-free or protein/ubiquitin mixtures in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. Following four washes with the same buffer, bound proteins were probed with rabbit anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody (GE Healthcare). Protein binding was detected using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). In the case of PtdSer binding studies of the His-PKCα C2 domain, in the absence and presence of ubiquitin, bound protein was detected using rabbit anti-His antibody (Rockland Inc.). The kinetics and affinity of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions were determined using a BIAcore X100 instrument. For ubiquitin interactions, 200 nm His-tagged ubiquitin (ligand) was immobilized using a NiCl2-activated NTA sensor chip (GE Healthcare) surface and used as a ligand, whereas untagged Tollip CUE or C2 domains, or GST-Tollip were flown as analyte. The first flow cell of the sensor chip was used as a control surface (no protein), whereas the second flow cell was employed as the active surface. His-tagged ubiquitin, in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.3), 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 50 μm EDTA, and 1 mm NaN3, was immobilized on the surface of one flow cell of the sensor chip. A range of concentrations of protein analytes prepared in the same buffer was injected on both flow cell surfaces at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Association and dissociation times for each protein injection were set at 120 and 600 s, respectively. The remaining bound protein was washed away by the injection of 30 μl of 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.3), 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 350 mm EDTA, and 1 mm NaN3. Tollip-PtdIns(3)P interactions were followed using PtdIns(3)P-free and -enriched liposomes as ligands and GST-Tollip as an analyte, similar to what we previously described (18.Ankem G. Mitra S. Sun F. Moreno A.C. Chutvirasakul B. Azurmendi H.F. Li L. Capelluto D.G. The C2 domain of Tollip, a Toll-like receptor signalling regulator, exhibits broad preference for phosphoinositides.Biochem. J. 2011; 435: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In all cases, sensorgrams were obtained from eight different concentrations of each of the tested proteins. For the competition experiments, GST-Tollip (900 nm) was preincubated with increasing molar concentrations of untagged ubiquitin for 1 h at room temperature. Free and ubiquitin-bound GST-Tollip was then flown over PtdIns(3)P-free and PtdIns(3)P-enriched liposomes, which were immobilized on the L1 sensor chip surface. To estimate the kinetic parameters, sensorgrams best fit to the two-state (conformational change) and bivalent analyte binding models using BIAcore X100 evaluation software (version 2.0). The χ2 values were less than 10% of the maximal binding response (Rmax) for each data set. NMR data were acquired at 25 °C using a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer (Virginia Tech) equipped with an inverse TBI probe with z axis pulsed-field gradients. Two-dimensional 1H,15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments were used to track backbone amide resonance changes in 15N-labeled proteins due to interaction with the unlabeled protein partner. For ubiquitin-Tollip C2 domain interactions, 30 μm ubiquitin was prepared in 20 mm d11-Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm d18-DTT and unlabeled Tollip C2 domain was added at 8-fold excess to visualize resonance perturbations. In the case of ubiquitin-Tollip CUE domain interactions, 50 μm 15N-Tollip CUE domain was prepared in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7) and unlabeled ubiquitin was added at 2-fold excess. Reciprocally, 50 μm 15N-ubiquitin was prepared in the same buffer and unlabeled Tollip CUE domain was added at 2-fold excess. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe (22.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S.

Δδ(1H,15N)=[(Δδ1H)2+(Δ15N)2/6]0.5Eq.1 Far-UV (190–240 nm) circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed on a JASCO J-815 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Jasco PFD-425 S temperature control unit. Five accumulated untagged protein (10 μm) CD spectra were recorded in 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 100 mm KF at 25 °C using a 1-mm path-length quartz cell, a bandwidth of 4 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan rate of 20 nm/min. Buffer backgrounds were subtracted from the protein spectra. Various concentrations of free protein and complex were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT for 30 min at 25 °C. Protein samples (1.5 ml) were applied to a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with the same buffer, and run at 1 ml/min at 4 °C using an ÄKTA 900 Purifier FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Proteins were detected by their absorption at 280 nm. Fractions were collected and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The column was calibrated with protein standards (blue dextran, BSA, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen A, myoglobin, ribonuclease A, and aprotinin). Stokes radii of the proteins were determined by logarithmic interpolation. Sedimentation velocity experiments with Tollip CUE (605 μm), ubiquitin (900 μm), and a 1:1 molar ratio of the Tollip CUE-ubiquitin complex (350 μm each) were carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge equipped with a 50Ti 8-hole rotor and using a 12-mm path length cell (Biophysics Core, University of Colorado, Denver, CO). Absorbance profiles at 273 nm were collected every 30 s at 45,000 rpm and 25 °C. Sedimentation coefficient continuous c(S) distributions were determined using SEDFIT software (25.Schuck P. Rossmanith P. Determination of the sedimentation coefficient distribution by least-squares boundary modeling.Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The resulting apparent sedimentation coefficients were corrected to standard conditions as reported (26.Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Modern analytical ultracentrifugation in protein science. A tutorial review.Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular weight of the protein was estimated using the Siegel-Monty analysis (27.Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Determination of molecular weights and frictional ratios of proteins in impure systems by use of gel filtration and density gradient centrifugation. Application to crude preparations of sulfite and hydroxylamine reductases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Tollip localizes to endosomal membranes and the subcellular localization of the protein is likely associated with its ability to preferentially bind PtdIns(3)P through its central C2 domain (18.Ankem G. Mitra S. Sun F. Moreno A.C. Chutvirasakul B. Azurmendi H.F. Li L. Capelluto D.G. The C2 domain of Tollip, a Toll-like receptor signalling regulator, exhibits broad preference for phosphoinositides.Biochem. J. 2011; 435: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because Tollip binds ubiquitin through its CUE domain (19.Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. A ubiquitin-binding motif required for intramolecular monoubiquitylation, the CUE domain.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we then asked whether ubiquitin regulates phosphoinositide recognition.

https://openalex.org/W2162230349,"Multiple lines of evidence support the notion that DNA ligase III (LIG3), the only DNA ligase found in mitochondria, is essential for viability in both whole organisms and in cultured cells. Previous attempts to generate cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA ligase failed. Here, we report, for the first time, the derivation of viable LIG3-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These cells lack mtDNA and are auxotrophic for uridine and pyruvate, which may explain the apparent lethality of the Lig3 knock-out observed in cultured cells in previous studies. Cells with severely reduced expression of LIG3 maintain normal mtDNA copy number and respiration but show reduced viability in the face of alkylating and oxidative damage, increased mtDNA degradation in response to oxidative damage, and slow recovery from mtDNA depletion. Our findings clarify the cellular role of LIG3 and establish that the loss of viability in LIG3-deficient cells is conditional and secondary to the ρ(0) phenotype."

Intriguingly, although dephosphorylating substrate proteins, Shp2 plays an overall positive role in the signal transduction of receptor and cytosolic kinases, particularly the Ras-Erk pathway (4.Chan G.

Mitochondria are highly dynamic cellular organelles that play multiple roles in cells, including energy production, intermediate metabolism, apoptosis, and maintenance of cytoplasmic calcium homeostasis (27.Balaban R.S.

Induced knock-in of this mutation in pan hematopoietic cells leads to myeloproliferative disease followed by malignant evolution into various acute leukemias (32.Xu D. Liu X. Yu W.M. Meyerson H.J. Guo C. Gerson S.L. Qu C.K. Non-lineage/stage-restricted effects of a gain-of-function mutation in tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 (Shp2) on malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells.J. Exp.

During the course of examining the role of the Shp2 E76K mutant on growth factor signaling in the cells isolated from this line of mice, we accidently found that induction of the Ptpn11E76K/+ mutation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) caused growth arrest. We therefore further characterized the pathogenic effects of this mutation in MEFs. Antibodies against phospho-Erk, Erk, phospho-Stat3, Stat3, Shp2, and p21 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Dallas, TX). Antibodies against phosphor-Akt and Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). p53 antibody was from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA). The lactate assay kit was provided by Biovision (Golden, CO). MTS ([3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] was obtained from Promega Life Science ( Madison, WI). Conditional Ptpn11E76K knock-in (Ptpn11E76K Neo/+) mice were used to cross estrogen receptor promoter driven Cre transgenic (ER-Cre+) mice at the Animal Resources Center, Case Western Reserve University. All animal procedures complied with the NIH Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For generation of inducible Ptpn11E76K knock-in MEFs, embryonic day 15.5–17.5 embryos were dissected from timed pregnant females. Following removal of the heads and internal organs, embryos were minced and tissue masses were plated and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Three days later, embryonic fibroblasts were harvested and designated as passage 1. Ptpn11+/+/ER-Cre+ and Ptpn11E76K Neo/+/ER-Cre+ MEFs were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, 0.5 μm) to induce Cre expression, deletion of the Neo cassette, and expression of Shp2 E76K from the targeted allele in Ptpn11E76K/+/ER-Cre+ MEFs. To measure cell growth rate, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 103 cells and incubated overnight. MTS was added, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 1 h. Viable cells were determined using a microplate reader at an absorbance of 492 nm. MEFs were seeded in 35-mm dishes at a density of 4 × 104 cells per dish. The day after, cells were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity as previously described (33.Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. A biomarker that identifies senescent human cells in culture and in aging skin in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). Positive cells were counted in 400 cells. For apoptosis analysis, cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed in ice-cold 75% ethanol at −20 °C overnight. Fixed cells were treated with RNase A (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, washed with PBS, and then stained with propidium iodide (PI) (50 μg/ml in PBS). Apoptotic cells with Sub-G1 DNA content were quantified by standard FACS procedures. To measure mitochondrial mass, cells were incubated for 15 min with 20 nm MitoTracker Green (Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY) and then washed with PBS. The intensity of labeling was measured by FACS. To measure mitochondrial membrane potential, cells were incubated with 20 nm MitoFluor Red (Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY) for 20 min and then washed with PBS. The intensity of labeling was measured by standard FACS. To measure cellular ROS levels, cells were loaded with 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY) (5 μm) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Fluorescence probes were detected and mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) were quantified by FACS. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured at 37 °C using an XF24 extracellular analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). MEFs were seeded in 24-well plates for 12 h. Medium was changed to un-buffered DMEM (DMEM supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 31 mm NaCl, 2 mm GlutaMax, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C in a non-CO2 incubator for 1 h. All injection reagents were adjusted to pH 7.4 on the day of the assay. Four baseline measurements were taken before sequential injection of mitochondrial inhibitors. OCR and ECAR were automatically calculated by the Seahorse XF-24 software. Every point represents an average of 3–5 different wells. After the assays, plates were saved, and protein concentration in each well was determined using a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Total cellular ATP levels were assessed using adenosine 5′-triphosphate bioluminescent assay kit (Biovision, Golden, CO) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Measurement of mitochondrial respiration was performed using a platinum electrode (Dissolved Oxygen Package, Qubit systems, Canada) at 30 °C. Mitochondria were isolated from liver homogenates of Ptpn11E76K/+/Alb-Cre+ mice and Ptpn11+/+/Alb-Cre+ control mice following the protocol previously described (34.Frezza C. Cipolat S. Scorrano L. Organelle isolation: functional mitochondria from mouse liver, muscle and cultured fibroblasts.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein) pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of respiration buffer (120 mm KCl, 3 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1% BSA, pH 7.4) and assayed for respiration using pyruvate (5 mm)/malate (2.5 μm) or palmitoylCoA (10 nm)/carnitine (2.5 μm)/malate (2.5 μm) as substrates for mitochondria respiration. ADP was added in limiting amounts, and State 3 was measured. Following depletion of ADP, State 4 was measured. Rates of O2 consumption were expressed in nmol O2/mg mitochondrial protein/minute. The ADP:O ratio was calculated as the amount of added ADP expressed in nmol divided by the amount of oxygen consumed during State 3 respiration. Cells or tissues were lysed. Whole cell lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-Shp2 antibody. Immune complexes were washed twice with a washing buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100), once with a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES pH 7.2, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA. p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (1.5 mg/ml pNPP in tyrosine phosphatase assay buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml BSA) was then added to each sample and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Supernatants were transferred to 96-well plates and absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered to be significant.

In these knock-in mice, the inserted Neo cassette with a stop codon prevents expression of the targeted allele (Ptpn11E76K Neo). However, after the deletion of Neo by Cre DNA recombinase, the Neo-deleted mutant allele (Ptpn11E76K) is reactivated, producing mutant Shp2 E76K at the physiological level (32.Xu D. Liu X. Yu W.M. Meyerson H.J. Guo C. Gerson S.L. Qu C.K. Non-lineage/stage-restricted effects of a gain-of-function mutation in tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 (Shp2) on malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1977-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism underlying the inactivation of the targeted allele is unclear, this conditional allele allows expression of mutant Shp2 E76K under the endogenous Ptpn11 promoter in an inducible manner. To study the pathogenic effects of the Ptpn11E76K mutation on cell signaling and cellular function, we generated conditional Ptpn11E76K mutation knock-in cell models. Ptpn11E76K Neo/+ mice were used to cross estrogen receptor promoter-driven Cre transgenic (ER-Cre+) mice. E.15.5-E.17.5 embryos derived were dissected to generate Ptpn11E76K Neo/+/ER-Cre+ and Ptpn11+/+/ER-Cre+ MEFs following standard procedures. The insertion of Neo inactivated the targeted allele (Ptpn11E76K Neo) in Ptpn11E76K Neo/+/ER-Cre+ cells. However, when these cells were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Cre expression was induced, leading to the deletion of the Neo cassette (data not shown), and thus the reactivation of the mutant allele (Ptpn11E76K) and restoration of Shp2 E76K expression to the physiological level (Fig. 1, A and B). Shp2 phosphatase activity in 4-OHT-treated Ptpn11E76K/+/ER-Cre+ MEFs was increased by ∼4-fold (Fig. 1C), in agreement with previous observations that the E76K mutation hyper-activates Shp2 (12.Tartaglia M. Niemeyer C.M. Fragale A. Song X. Buechner J. Jung A. Hählen K. Hasle H. Licht J.D. Gelb B.D.

Surprisingly, cell growth assessment showed that Neo depletion and Shp2 E76K expression resulted in a substantially decreased cell growth in Ptpn11E76K/+ MEFs while the growth of Ptpn11+/+ MEFs was not altered by 4-OHT treatment (Fig. 1D). To characterize the growth arrest induced by the Ptpn11E76K/+ mutation, we determined cell apoptosis. This analysis revealed a markedly increased sub-G1 population in 4-OHT-treated mutant cells compared with that in control cells (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the Ptpn11E76K/+mutation caused apoptosis and that the apoptotic effect was related to the induction of the oncogene. The apoptosis results were also confirmed by the Annexin V assay (data not sho"
https://openalex.org/W2157002139,"The hyaluronan receptor CD44 undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavage at the cell surface. The initial cleavage of the CD44 extracellular domain is followed by a second intramembranous cleavage of the residual CD44 fragment, liberating the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of CD44. In this study conditions that promote CD44 cleavage resulted in a diminished capacity to assemble and retain pericellular matrices even though sufficient non-degraded full-length CD44 remained. Using stable and transient overexpression of the cytoplasmic domain of CD44, we determined that the intracellular domain interfered with anchoring of the full-length CD44 to the cytoskeleton and disrupted the ability of the cells to bind hyaluronan and assemble a pericellular matrix. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to determine whether the mechanism of this interference was due to competition with actin adaptor proteins. CD44 of control chondrocytes was found to interact and co-immunoprecipitate with both the 65- and 130-kDa isoforms of ankyrin-3. Moreover, this interaction with ankyrin-3 proteins was diminished in cells overexpressing the CD44 intracellular domain. Mutating the putative ankyrin binding site of the transiently transfected CD44 intracellular domain diminished the inhibitory effects of this protein on matrix retention. Although CD44 in other cells types has been shown to interact with members of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family of adaptor proteins, only modest interactions between CD44 and moesin could be demonstrated in chondrocytes. The data suggest that release of the CD44 intracellular domain into the cytoplasm of cells such as chondrocytes exerts a competitive or dominant-negative effect on the function of full-length CD44."
https://openalex.org/W1967488508,"The dopamine transporter (DAT) is responsible for sequestration of extracellular dopamine (DA). The psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH) is a DAT substrate, which is actively transported into the nerve terminal, eliciting vesicular depletion and reversal of DA transport via DAT. Here, we investigate the role of the DAT C terminus in AMPH-evoked DA efflux using cell-permeant dominant-negative peptides. A peptide, which corresponded to the last 24 C-terminal residues of DAT (TAT-C24 DAT) and thereby contained the Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) binding domain and the PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding sequence of DAT, was made membrane-permeable by fusing it to the cell membrane transduction domain of the HIV-1 Tat protein (TAT-C24WT). The ability of TAT-C24WT but not a scrambled peptide (TAT-C24Scr) to block the CaMKIIα-DAT interaction was supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in heterologous cells. In heterologous cells, we also found that TAT-C24WT, but not TAT-C24Scr, decreased AMPH-evoked 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium efflux. Moreover, chronoamperometric recordings in striatum revealed diminished AMPH-evoked DA efflux in mice preinjected with TAT-C24WT. Both in heterologous cells and in striatum, the peptide did not further inhibit efflux upon KN-93-mediated inhibition of CaMKIIα activity, consistent with a dominant-negative action preventing binding of CaMKIIα to the DAT C terminus. This was further supported by the ability of a peptide with perturbed PDZ-binding sequence, but preserved CaMKIIα binding (TAT-C24AAA), to diminish AMPH-evoked DA efflux in vivo to the same extent as TAT-C24WT. Finally, AMPH-induced locomotor hyperactivity was attenuated following systemic administration of TAT-C24WT but not TAT-C24Scr. Summarized, our findings substantiate that DAT C-terminal protein-protein interactions are critical for AMPH-evoked DA efflux and suggest that it may be possible to target protein-protein interactions to modulate transporter function and interfere with psychostimulant effects."
https://openalex.org/W2033658160,"Social animals establish flexible behaviors and integrated decision-making processes to adapt to social environments. Such behaviors are impaired in all major neuropsychiatric disorders and depend on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We previously showed that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and norepinephrine (NE) in the PFC are necessary for mice to show adapted social cognition. Here, we investigated how the cholinergic and NE systems converge within the PFC to modulate social behavior. We used a social interaction task (SIT) in C57BL/6 mice and mice lacking β2*nAChRs (β2(-/-) mice), making use of dedicated software to analyze >20 social sequences and pinpoint social decisions. We performed specific PFC NE depletions before SIT and measured monoamines and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in limbic corticostriatal circuitry. After PFC-NE depletion, C57BL/6 mice exhibited impoverished and more rigid social behavior and were 6-fold more aggressive than sham-lesioned animals, whereas β2(-/-) mice showed unimpaired social behavior. Our biochemical measures suggest a critical involvement of DA in SIT. In addition, we show that the balance between basal levels of monoamines and of ACh modulates aggressiveness and this modulation requires functional β2*nAChRs. These findings demonstrate the critical interplay between prefrontal NE and nAChRs for the development of adapted and nonaggressive social cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2149205972,"Combinations of anticancer therapies with high efficacy and low toxicities are highly sought after. Therefore, we studied the effect of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) inhibitors on prostate cancer cells as a single agent and in combination with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors valproic acid and vorinostat. IC50s of Plk1 inhibitors BI 2536 and BI 6727 were determined in prostate cancer cells by MTS assays. Morphological and molecular changes were assessed by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, real-time RT-PCR, and pulldown assays. Efficacy of combination therapy was assessed by MTS and clonogenic assays. IC50 values in DU145, LNCaP, and PC3 cells were 50, 75, and 175 nM, respectively, for BI 2536 and 2.5, 5, and 600 nM, respectively, for BI 6727. Human prostate fibroblasts and normal prostate epithelial cells were unaffected at these concentrations. While DU145 and LNCaP cells were solely arrested in mitosis on treatment, PC3 cells accumulated in G2 phase and mitosis, suggesting a weak spindle assembly checkpoint. Combining Plk1 inhibitors with HDAC inhibitors had synergistic antitumor effects in vitro. DMSO-treated prostate cancer cells were used as controls to study the effect of Plk1 and HDAC inhibition. Plk1 inhibitors decreased proliferation and clonogenic potential of prostate cancer cells. Hence, Plk1 may serve as an important molecular target for inhibiting prostate cancer. Combining HDAC inhibitors with BI 2536 or BI 6727 may be an effective treatment strategy against prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1996376751,"Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, present at the plasma membrane of vascular endothelial cells, bind to the angiogenic growth factor VEGFA to modulate its signaling through VEGFR2. The interactions between VEGFA and proteoglycan co-receptors require sulfated domains in the HS chains. To date, it is essentially unknown how the formation of sulfated protein-binding domains in HS can be regulated by microRNAs. In the present study, we show that microRNA-24 (miR-24) targets NDST1 to reduce HS sulfation and thereby the binding affinity of HS for VEGFA. Elevated levels of miR-24 also resulted in reduced levels of VEGFR2 and blunted VEGFA signaling. Similarly, suppression of NDST1 using siRNA led to a reduction in VEGFR2 expression. Consequently, not only VEGFA binding, but also VEGFR2 protein expression is dependent on NDST1 function. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-24, or siRNA-mediated reduction of NDST1, reduced endothelial cell chemotaxis in response to VEGFA. These findings establish NDST1 as a target of miR-24 and demonstrate how such NDST1 suppression in endothelial cells results in reduced responsiveness to VEGFA."

To better understand the physiological implications of this response, we used fluorescent markers to locate specific sites on Escherichia coli chromosomes following exposure to cytotoxic stress.

Conclusion: Chromosome convergence enables repair of double strand DNA breaks. Significance: Exposure to diverse stressful conditions primes bacteria to cope with detrimental DNA lesions. A particularly deleterious type of DNA damage is double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) 2The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand DNA break; NA, nalidixic acid; FROS, Fluorescent Repressor Operator Systems; eCFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. (1.Pennington J.M. Rosenberg S.M. Spontaneous DNA breakage in single living Escherichia coli cells.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An important repair mechanism of this lesion proceeds through homologous repair, which relies on the interaction of chromosomal ends generated by DSBs with homologous sequences that act as templates (2.Kowalczykowski S.C.

Recombinational repair of DNA damage in Escherichia coli and bacteriophage λ.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 751-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, homologous repair strictly depends on the accessibility of such templates to severed DNA ends. In eukaryotes, this prerequisite is met by cohesin-mediated apposition of sister chromatids (4.Sjögren C. Nasmyth K.

It is thus generally assumed that for homologous repair to occur in bacteria, severed DNA ends need to conduct a genome-wide homology search (2.Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K.

Genome-wide search is, however, inconsistent with the emerging view of genome morphology in bacteria. Specifically, recent studies demonstrated that chromosomal sites in bacteria are persistently localized at specific cytoplasmic addresses (9.Viollier P.H. Thanbichler M. McGrath P.T. West L.

Esnault E. Valens M. Spatial arrangement and macrodomain organization of bacterial chromosomes.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Such a genome organization, which indicates a highly constrained motion of chromosomal sites, implies that a genome-wide search is unlikely. This claim is supported by the finding that diffusion of genomic sites is substantially slower than that revealed by proteins (23.Marshall W.F. Straight A. Marko J.F. Swedlow J. Dernburg A.

Biol. 1997; 7: 930-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), indicating that homology search conducted by chromosomal sites for homologous templates cannot be considered in terms of a search performed by proteins for their cognate DNA sequences (24.Weiner A. Zauberman N. Minsky A. Recombinational DNA repair in a cellular context: a search for the homology search.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, although significant insights into the process by which DSBs identify their homologous repair templates have recently been achieved (25.Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P.

Zauberman N. Minsky A. Recombinational DNA repair in a cellular context: a search for the homology search.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly evident that exposure of bacteria to diverse detrimental conditions results in massive genome condensation (27.Wolf S.G. Frenkiel D. Arad T. Finkel S.E. Kolter R.

The physiological implications of this apparently generic stress response, which was recently demonstrated to occur also in archaea (33.Delmas S. Duggin I.G. Allers T. DNA damage induces nucleoid compaction via the Mre11-Rad50 complex in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 87: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), remain unclear. By using fluorescent markers to locate specific Escherichia coli chromosomal sites, we show that stress-induced genome condensation proceeds through an orderly convergence of segregated sister chromosomes rather than through random DNA collapse. This convergence is suggested to initiate at the replication forks and to be mediated by the recently demonstrated ability of identical double-stranded DNA molecules to specifically identify each other and generate robust complexes (34.Baldwin G.S. Brooks N.J. Robson R.E. Wynveen A. Goldar A. Leikin S. Seddon J.M. Kornyshev A.A. DNA double helices recognize mutual sequence homology in a protein free environment.J. Phys. Chem.

We propose that the ensuing proximity of homologous chromosomal sites throughout chromosomal arms enables DSB repair in a mechanism that is independent of a genome-wide search yet consistent with the current physical understanding of the morphology of bacterial genomes. The results reported here imply that genome condensation, triggered even by relatively moderate stressful conditions and cellular damage, primes bacteria to rapidly and effectively cope with highly detrimental DNA lesions such as DSBs. Moreover, although our observations are consistent with the notion that RecA plays an essential role in the identification of accurate homologous template as well as in the formation of a stable complex between presynaptic filaments and their repair templates (2.Kowalczykowski S.C.

Cell. 2004; 15: 965-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), these findings imply that, in contrast to the widespread conviction, RecA-dependent genome-wide search is not required for DSB homologous repair. E. coli wild-type strain used in this study was AB1157. WBN2 RecA− strain is an AB1157 derivative. IL05-RecA− was constructed by P1 transduction of the DrecA306::Tn10 locus from WBN2 into IL05 and selection for tetracycline, gentamicin, and kanamycin resistance. The recA deletion was confirmed by colony PCR and DNA sequencing. A strain carrying I-SceI endonuclease under PBAD arabinose-inducible promoter and a single I-SceI chromosomal cut site (SMR8478; gift from S. Rosenberg) (1.Pennington J.M. Rosenberg S.M. Spontaneous DNA breakage in single living Escherichia coli cells.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was used for DSB induction at a single chromosomal site (Table 1). To construct the SMR8478-FseI strain (Table 1) that enables generation of five DSBs, plasmid pZS*32-FseI that harbors FseI endonuclease under the control of the PLlacO-1 promoter was transformed into SMR8478 cells. Cells were regularly grown in LB at 37 °C. NA and chloramphenicol (Sigma) were added to mid-log cultures to concentrations of 50–500 or 100 μg/ml, respectively. For endonuclease induction, SMR8478 and SMR8478-FseI strains were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.1% glucose to A600 = 0.3, centrifuged, resuspended in M9, including either 0.1% l-arabinose (for I-SceI induction) or 0.1% l-arabinose and 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (for induction of both I-SceI and FseI endonucleases), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. E. coli strains IL05 (wild-type and RecA−) and WX51 were used for visualization of chromosomal sites. IL05 carries on its chromosome an array of 240 copies of tetO (tetO240-Gm) inserted close to the origin and an array of 240 copies of lacO (lacO240-Km) inserted close to the terminus site (Fig. 1A). A second strain for visualization of chromosomal sites, WX51, carries 240 copies of lacO and 240 copies of tetO inserted at 90° and 270° of the chromosome, respectively (Fig. 1B). A multicopy plasmid, pLAU53 (Table 1), expressing LacI-eCFP and TetR-eYFP (enhanced cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins, respectively) fusion repressors from PBAD arabinose promoter was used as a source of fluorescently labeled LacI and TetR. The FROS systems were kindly provided by D. Sherratt. Strains were grown to A600 ∼0.5, treated with antibiotics, and stained with the membrane stain FM4-64 (25 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and DAPI (0.5 ng/ml; Sigma) for 15 min. For FROS experiments, E. coli IL05 (wild-type and RecA−) or WX51 carrying pLAU53 was grown to A600 ∼0.3, induced with 0.01% l-arabinose for 30 min, and exposed to antibiotics as described above. Cells were then placed on 1% agarose pads prepared in a CoverWell Imaging Chamber (Sigma). Samples were visualized with ×100 oil immersion objective and photographed using a Deltavision microscope (Applied Precision). eCFP and eYFP were visualized by using ET470/24m and ET535/30m filters (Chroma), respectively. The signals of DAPI and FM4-64 were viewed by using ET457/40 and ET617/63 filters (Chroma), respectively. All images were identically de-convoluted and processed with the conservative SoftWorx package (Applied Precision). Time-lapse studies were conducted on E. coli IL05 and WX51 cells carrying pLAU53. Cultures were grown in LB to A600 ∼0.3 and induced with 0.02% l-arabinose for 30 min. Cells were placed on 1% LB-agarose pads containing 500 μg/ml NA. Because of rapid bleaching of CFP, only YFP excitation was used in some time-lapse experiments, enabling localization of origin-proximal or 270° tetO foci. Images were de-convoluted with the conservative SoftWorx package and processed with ImageJ software. Chromosomal site localization was analyzed by using E. coli strains in which tetO and lacO arrays were inserted at various chromosomal sites (Fig. 1). These strains carry a plasmid encoding TetR-eYFP and LacI-eCFP repressors (FROS) (7.Lau I.F. Filipe S.R. Søballe B. Økstad O.A. Barre F.X. Sherratt D.J.

Decoration of chromosomal sites following replication with the fluorescently tagged repressors provides a means for probing cellular addresses of homologous sites located on sister chromosomes. In unstressed, exponentially growing E. coli cells (strains IL05 and AB1157; Table 1), chromatin is spread over the entire cytoplasm (Fig. 2A; Table 2), as is the case for other bacterial strains such as Bacillus subtilis (29.Smith B.T.

In addition, exposure of IL05 cells to oxidative irradiation (γ, 137Cs source) that inflicts DNA lesions at doses of 100 and 200 gray resulted in genome condensation in 21 ± 2 and 34 ± 3% of the cells, respectively (data not shown).

In sharp contrast, NA-treated cells reveal only a single origin-proximal focus or two closely adjacent foci (Fig. 2, D, F, H, and J; TABLE 3, TABLE 4), which are always separated from the terminus-proximal site. These observations are supported by time-lapse experiments (supplemental Movies S1 and S2), which reveal progressive convergence of origin-proximal sites that culminates in their coalescence. Notably, whereas the inherently limited resolution of fluorescence microscopy does not allow unequivocal determination of the precise relative position of the origin-proximal foci, the progressive approach of these sites toward each other as well as the observation that once merged they remain co-localized support the notion that these foci do indeed coalesce. Collectively, these findings indicate co-localization of homologous sites (represented by origin-proximal foci) but not of nonhomologous sites (origin- and terminus-proximal sites).TABLE 4Effects of NA (350 μg/ml) on the distribution of origin-proximal homologous sites in E. coli IL05NA incubation1 focus2 adjacent foci≥2 separated focin/Nmin% of cells% of cells% of cells105 ± 35 ± 390 ± 3151/22018 ± 220 ± 263 ± 2176/24038 ± 439 ± 423 ± 4244/36046 ± 251 ± 23 ± 2375/3 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Effects of NA (100 μg/ml) on the distribution of origin-proximal homologous sites in E. coli IL05NA incubation1 focus2 adjacent foci≥2 separated focin/Nmin% of cells% of cells% of cells002 ± 198 ± 1330/3103 ± 14 ± 193 ± 1178/32014 ± 318 ± 368 ± 3102/24033 ± 337 ± 330 ± 3304/36043 ± 348 ± 39 ± 3315/3 Open table in a new tab We propose that this co-localization of chromosomal homologous sites results from the convergence of sister chromosomes. A single origin-proximal focus in NA-treated bacteria derives from cells that, prior to being exposed to stress, maintained a single pair of segregating sister chromosomes that originated from a single replication-firing event. Two contiguous origin-proximal foci are suggested to arise from the convergence of two pairs of chromosome arms that resulted from two successive replication-firing events (as indicated in the model depicted in Fig. 6). This conjecture, which is supported by our time-lapse movies (supplemental Movies S1–S6), is further substantiated by a statistical analysis conducted on a large number (>500) of unstressed and NA-exposed cells. This analysis demonstrated that in unstressed cells, the ratio between two and four origin-proximal foci is 0.41. This ratio is very similar to that of a single and two contiguous foci revealed in NA-treated cells (0.44), implying that chromosome convergence occurs between chromosome sisters that derive from an identical replication-firing event. Notably, NA removal results in a progressive increase in the number of fluorescent foci in a limited but significant cell population (Table 5), indicating reversibility of genome condensation and re-initiation of chromosome segregation.TABLE 5Distribution of origin-proximal sites following NA (100 μg/ml) removalTime following NA removal1 focus2 focin/Nmin% of cells% of cells085 ± 515 ± 571/33068 ± 532 ± 5122/36064 ± 636 ± 655/2 Open table in a new tab To corroborate the claim that stress-induced genome condensation promotes convergence of sister chromosomes and to eliminate the possibility that this convergence is limited to origin-proximal sites, we used an additional FROS strain (WX51; Table 1) in which lacO and tetO arrays were inserted at 90° and 270° sites of the chromosome, respectively (FROS 2; Fig. 1B) (12.Wang X. Liu X. Possoz C. Sherratt D.J. The two Escherichia coli chromosome arms locate to separate cell halves.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1727-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells reveal two or four tetO and lacO foci (Fig. 3, A, C, and E; Table 6) that, following NA treatment, merge into a single tetO and a single lacO foci that are always spatially separated (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). Whereas only the tetO array (270° chromosomal site) could be probed in time-lapse experiments due to rapid eCFP bleaching, studies on cells fixed at different time points revealed that the nonhomologous tetO and lacO foci are consistently spatially separated, as shown in Fig. 3B. Notably, because FROS 2 probes the location of two distinct chromosomal sites, these observations, corroborated by time-lapse experiments (Fig. 3, C–F; supplemental Movie S3), further support the notion that genome condensation promotes convergence of chromosome arms th"
https://openalex.org/W2077382515,"The transient receptor potential melastatin 5 (TRPM5) channel is a monovalent cation channel activated by intracellular Ca(2+). Expression of this channel is restricted to taste cells, the pancreas and brainstem, and is thought to be involved in controlling membrane potentials. Its endogenous ligands are not well characterized. Here, we show that extracellular application of Zn(2+) inhibits TRPM5 activity. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, extracellular application of ZnCl2 inhibited step-pulse-induced TRPM5 currents with 500 nM free intracellular Ca(2+) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 4.3 μM at -80 mV). ZnSO4 also inhibited TRPM5 activity. Extracellular application of ZnCl2 inhibited TRPM5 activation at several temperatures. Furthermore, inhibition by 30 μM ZnCl2 was impaired in TRPM5 mutants in which His at 896, and Glu at 926 and/or Glu at 939 in the outer pore loop were replaced with Gln. From these results, we conclude that extracellular Zn(2+) inhibits TRPM5 channels, and the residues in the outer pore loop of TRPM5 are critically involved in the inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2165262017,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC), a key brain region for cognitive and emotional processes, is highly regulated by dopaminergic inputs. The dopamine D4 receptor, which is enriched in PFC, has been implicated in mental disorders, such as attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. Recently we have found homeostatic regulation of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in PFC pyramidal neurons by the D4 receptor, providing a potential mechanism for D4 in stabilizing cortical excitability. Because stress is tightly linked to adaptive and maladaptive changes associated with mental health and disorders, we examined the synaptic actions of D4 in stressed rats. We found that neural excitability was elevated by acute stress and dampened by repeated stress. D4 activation produced a potent reduction of excitatory transmission in acutely stressed animals and a marked increase of excitatory transmission in repeatedly stressed animals. These effects of D4 targeted GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors and relied on the bi-directional regulation of calcium/calmodulin kinase II activity. The restoration of PFC glutamatergic transmission in stress conditions may enable D4 receptors to serve as a synaptic stabilizer in normal and pathological conditions."

Previously, we reported that the progesterone receptors are stabilized in Brca1-deficient mammary epithelial cells, and treating with anti-progesterone delays mammary tumorigenesis in Brca1/p53 conditional knock-out mice, suggesting that the progesterone has a critical role in breast carcinogenesis. To further explore how the stability of progesterone receptor is modulated, here, we have found that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β phosphorylation of progesterone receptor-A (PR-A) facilitates its ubiquitination. GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of serine 390 in PR-A regulates its subsequent ubiquitination and protein stability. Expression of PR-A(S390A) mutant in the human breast epithelial cells, MCF-10A, results in enhanced proliferation and formation of aberrant acini structure in the three-dimensional culture. Consistently, reduction of phosphorylation of serine 390 of PR-A and GSK-3β activity is observed in the Brca1-deficient mammary gland. Taken together, these results provide important aspects of tissue specificity of BRCA1-mediated suppression of breast carcinogenesis."

Invertebrate models including the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans have been deployed for molecular genetic studies to inform on key components of these alcohol signaling pathways. C. elegans studies have typically employed external dosing with high (>250 mM) ethanol concentrations: A careful analysis of responses to low concentrations is lacking. Using the C. elegans pharyngeal system as a paradigm, we report a previously uncharacterized continuum of cellular and behavioral responses to ethanol from low (10 mM) to high (300 mM) concentrations. The complexity of these responses indicates that the pleiotropic action of ethanol observed in mammalian brain is conserved in this invertebrate model. We investigated two candidate ethanol effectors, the calcium-activated K(+) channel SLO-1 and gap junctions, and show that they contribute to, but are not sole determinants of, the low- and high-concentration effects, respectively. Notably, this study shows cellular and whole organismal behavioral responses to ethanol in C. elegans that directly equate to intoxicating through to supralethal blood alcohol concentrations in humans and provides an important benchmark for interpretation of paradigms that seek to inform on human alcohol use disorders."

IPK1 (inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase) phosphorylates inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate to inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate; however, the mechanism of IP recognition employed by IPK1 is currently unresolved. We demonstrated previously that IPK1 possesses an unstable N-terminal lobe in the absence of IP, which led us to propose that the phosphate profile of the IP was linked to stabilization of IPK1. Here, we describe a systematic study to determine the roles of the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 6-phosphate groups of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate in IP binding and IPK1 activation. The 5- and 6-phosphate groups were the most important for IP binding to IPK1, and the 1- and 3-phosphate groups were more important for IPK1 activation than the others. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are three critical residues (Arg-130, Lys-170, and Lys-411) necessary for IPK1 activity. Arg-130 is the only substrate-binding N-terminal lobe residue that can render IPK1 inactive; its 1-phosphate is critical for full IPK1 activity and for stabilization of the active conformation of IPK1. Taken together, our results support the model for recognition of the IP substrate by IPK1 in which (i) the 4-, 5-, and 6-phosphates are initially recognized by the C-terminal lobe, and subsequently, (ii) the interaction between the 1-phosphate and Arg-130 stabilizes the N-terminal lobe and activates IPK1.

IPs are produced by sequential phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate by a family of enzymes known as IP kinases (IPKs) (1Irvine R.F. Schell M.J. Back in the water: the return of the inositol phosphates.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Similarity between IPs, which sometimes differ by only one phosphate group on the inositol ring, demands that IPKs use mechanisms to recognize and phosphorylate specific positions of their IP substrates while excluding highly similar molecules. Crystal structures from each of the IPK subfamilies have revealed that the structural determinants for IP discrimination vary between IPKs. IP3K (Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase) employs shape complementarity to recognize precisely positioned phosphate and hydroxyl groups of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (6González B. Schell M.J.

In contrast, ITPK1 (inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase/inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate 1-kinase) discriminates among IPs using phosphate affinity and stereochemical features to establish contacts with phosphates that are sufficient for substrate recognition (7Miller G.J.

Crystal structures of IPK1 (inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase) in its IP substrate- and product-bound forms reveal extensive contacts with all phosphate groups of the bound IPs (8González B.

These structures reveal how inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP5) is phosphorylated on its axial 2′-hydroxyl, yielding inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate, but they do not suggest a mechanism through which IPK1 selectively recognizes IP5 as its substrate while excluding other highly phosphorylated IPs with free axial 2′-hydroxyl groups. We recently determined the crystal structure of wild-type IPK1 in an IP-free state, which exhibited disorder within its N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) of the kinase, centered at Arg-130 (9Gosein V.

Our current objective was to define the contributions of the individual phosphate groups of the IP to binding and to recognition of bound IP as a substrate. The results demonstrate that each phosphate group of the IP plays a different role in binding and activation of IPK1 and that there are three critical contacts formed between IPK1 and the IP that mediate IPK1 activation.

Mutation of these residues to alanine was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). A pET28a vector containing wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana IPK1 and a hexahistidine tag was used as a template (a kind gift from Dr. C. A. Brearley, University of East Anglia). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Wild-type IPK1 and alanine mutants were expressed in BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen) that were grown in Terrific Broth to A600 = 1.5 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 0.1% l-arabinose at 18 °C for 20 h. Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, and 50% glycerol using a sonicator. The supernatant was separated from the lysate by centrifugation at 45,000 × g. The supernatant was then diluted 5-fold using 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl, and 25 mm imidazole was added. IPK1 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Thermo Scientific) in a gravity column using 4 ml of dry beads/250 ml of culture. The beads were washed with 20 column volumes of 50 mm KPO4 (pH 8.0), 800 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1.7 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein was eluted using 250 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 300 mm NaCl, and then 2 mm DTT was added to the eluate. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Thermo Scientific) using BSA as a standard. Protein was stored at 4 °C and used within 72 h. Experiments were performed on a MicroCal iTC200 titration calorimeter (GE Healthcare). Wild-type IPK1 was purified and dialyzed into ITC buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (pH 7.0). After protein dialysis was complete, dialysis buffer was used to dissolve the ligands, IP, and AMP-PNP (Jena Bioscience). Titration experiments were performed at 25 °C with 100 μm IPK1 and 1 mm AMP-PNP in the cell and 1–2 mm IP in the syringe to ensure a final IP:IPK1 molar ratio of at least 2:1. Titration experiments were performed at least twice for each IP, and one set was chosen to represent data. Calorimetric data were analyzed using Origin 7.0 (MicroCal). Data were fitted with a one-site model using Equation 1, Q(i)=12nPtΔHV(1+XtnPt+1nKPt−((1+XtnPt+1nKPt)2−4XtnPt)12)(Eq. 1) where n is the number of IP-binding sites on IPK1, Pt is the total concentration of IPK1, Xt is the total concentration of IP, V is the cell volume, K is the binding constant, and ΔH corresponds to the enthalpy change due to IP-IPK1 binding. The heat corresponding to the ith injection only, ΔQ(i), is equal to the difference between Q(i) and Q(i − 1) and is given by Equation 2, ΔQ(i)=Q(i)+dViVo(Q(i)+Q(i−1)2)−Q(i−1)(Eq. 2) which is corrected by the injection volume (dVi) for the displaced volume. IPs (IP5, 1,3,4,5-inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4), 1,4,5,6-IP4, 1,3,4,6-IP4, and 3,4,5,6-IP4) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company. A source for 1,3,5,6-IP4 was not located. IPK1 kinase activity was assessed using the Kinase-Glo Max luminescent kinase assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Kinase reactions were performed in 25-μl volumes on black 96-well plates at 25 °C. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 300 μm ATP. 25 μl of Kinase-Glo reagent was added to stop the reaction, and luminescence was measured after 20 min on a Berthold Orion II microplate luminometer. Initially, 80 μm IP was used, and the amount of enzyme was varied to determine conditions in which product formation was linear over 30 min. Subsequently, an array of reactions with varying concentrations of IP (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 μm) stopped at various time points (2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min) were performed in triplicate. The rate of product formation versus IP concentration was plotted and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression to determine Km and Vmax (GraphPad Software). The kcat values were calculated using the equation kcat = Vmax/[E], where [E] is the micromolar enzyme concentration. Initially, 150 ng of each mutant was tested for kinase activity with 80 μm IP5 after 30 min. Mutants that exhibited little or no activity were retested using 750 ng of enzyme. Active mutants were further characterized for their kinetic parameters with IP5 as a substrate using the abovementioned approach. To determine the role of phosphates at each position of the inositol ring, we measured the effect on binding affinity when using IPs lacking a phosphate group at the 1-, 3-, 5-, or 6-position. Using ITC, we obtained KD values for each IP4 and IP5 (Table 1). As expected, IP5, the native substrate for IPK1, displayed the highest binding affinity, with KD = 0.60 μm. IP4s exhibited a range of binding affinities. The KD values of 1,4,5,6-IP4 and 3,4,5,6-IP4 were 13-fold higher than that of IP5, whereas the KD values of 1,3,4,6-IP4 and 1,3,4,5-IP4 were at least 30-fold higher. These results indicate that different phosphate groups have varying contributions to the binding affinity of IP5 for IPK1. Comparison of the IP4 KD:IP5 KD ratios revealed that the 5- and 6-phosphates contributed the most to the binding affinity of the IP, as the absence of either phosphate group dramatically increased the KD (Table 1).TABLE 1Binding data of IPK1 for IP5 and IP4sIPN (sites)KKDΔHΔSm−1μmcal/molcal/mol/degreesIP50.8951.68 × 1060.60−11,900−11.41,3,4,6-IP40.8953.72 × 10426.88−8720−8.341,4,5,6-IP41.141.22 × 1058.20−7551−2.053,4,5,6-IP40.6561.33 × 1057.52−18,300−37.91,3,4,5-IP41.195.49 × 10418.21−10,140−12.3 Open table in a new tab We tested the kinase activity of IPK1 for IP5 and IP4s using a luminescence-based assay to determine which phosphates identify an IP as a substrate for IPK1 (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The kinase activity of IPK1 was maximal in the presence of IP5, with kcat = 44.02 ± 3.19 nmol/min. With 1,3,4,6-IP4, an IP lacking the 5-phosphate, there was a modest decrease in kinase activity, with kcat = 27.48 ± 4.00 nmol/min. In contrast, IPs lacking 1- and 3-phosphate groups exhibited a substantial 85% decrease in activity compared with IP5. No activity was detected when 1,3,4,5-IP4 was used as a substrate, suggesting that the 6-phosphate may also be important for activation. These results indicate that the 1- and 3-phosphates are important for the IP to be recognized as a substrate by IPK1. We also observed that the KD values for IPs lacking phosphates varied considerably, whereas the Km for each IP remained nearly constant (Table 2). This disconnect suggests that the kinetic parameters of ligand binding or catalysis change along with the binding affinity, but we cannot define with the current set of assays how they change.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of IPK1 for IP5 and IP4sIPKmkcatμmmin−1IP563.05 ± 10.7744.02 ± 3.191,3,4,6-IP466.81 ± 22.3727.48 ± 4.001,4,5,6-IP455.99 ± 13.956.60 ± 0.663,4,5,6-IP447.54 ± 13.946.30 ± 0.681,3,4,5-IP4NDND Open table in a new tab To identify the contacts between IPK1 and IP that are essential for activity, we mutated to alanine those IPK1 residues that interact with the IP and tested these mutants for activity for IP5 (Table 3). To compare the kinase activity between mutants, we determined kcat values for each mutant. For wild-type IPK1, kcat = 44.02 ± 3.19 nmol/min. Mutation of Arg-130, the only residue that interacts with the 1-phosphate of the IP, resulted in no detectable activity. Mutations of Lys-168 and Asp-368, which mediate phosphoryl transfer from ATP to the 2′-hydroxyl, also exhibited no activity, as expected. The R45A mutant, which abolished the contact with the 3-phosphate, displayed a 40% decrease in kinase activity (kcat = 27.16 ± 1.79 nmol/min), whereas the R415A and Y419A mutants, which abolished contacts with the 4-phosphate, both displayed activity equivalent to wild-type IPK1. In contrast, the K411A mutant, which abolished contacts with both the 3- and 4-phosphates, showed no activity. The R192A mutant displayed a modest decrease in kinase activity (kcat = 22.01 ± 2.05 nmol/min), and the H196A mutant had no effect on kinase activity (kcat = 34.12 ± 4.33 nmol/min), demonstrating that interactions with the 5-position have modest impact on catalytic activity. The K170A mutant, which abolished interactions with both the 5- and 6-phosphates, showed no activity. Finally, the K200A, N238A, and N239A mutants, which eliminated contacts with the 6-phosphate, displayed reduced activity compared with wild-type IPK1. Fig. 2 summarizes the effect of alanine mutations in the inositide-binding site on IPK1 activity. Here, we observed that the residues that interact with more than one phosphate play important roles in substrate recognition, whereas most residues that interact with a single phosphate play lesser roles in this process.TABLE 3Kinetic parameters of IPK1 alanine mutants for IP5MutantKmkcatPO4 interactionμmmin−1R45A54.28 ± 9.0727.16 ± 1.793R130ANDND1K168ANDND2K170ANDND5, 6R192A59.35 ± 13.4122.01 ± 2.055H196A43.48 ± 15.6234.12 ± 4.335K200A39.79 ± 19.5216.74 ± 2.776N238A33.72 ± 7.91814.74 ± 1.076N239A83.30 ± 9.5315.89 ± 0.876D368ANDND2K411ANDND3, 4R415A62.27 ± 21.8938.71 ± 5.733, 4Y419A76.86 ± 16.9441.62 ± 4.254 Open table in a new tab Here, we performed a systematic study to identify the relative contributions of the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 6-phosphates to IP5 binding affinity and recognition as an IPK1 substrate. Initially, we used ITC to determine the binding affinity of IPK1 for IP5 and for a set of IP4s, each lacking a single phosphate group. We observed a spectrum of affinities for these differently phosphorylated IP4 molecules, indicating that phosphates contribute differently to binding. IPs lacking the 5- or 6-phosphate displayed the lowest binding affinity for IPK1, whereas IPs lacking the 1- or 3-phosphate displayed only moderately decreased binding affinity (Table 1). The structure of nucleotide-bound IPK1 (Protein Data Bank code 3UDS) revealed the N-lobe to be unstable compared with the IP-bound state, and in a recent structure of IPK1 engineered to crystallize in the absence of IP (Protein Data Bank code 4AXC), the N-lobe was too far away from the C-lobe to form a complete inositide-binding pocket (9Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J.

In both wild-type and mutant structures, the N-lobe fails to assemble into the active conformation. Our ITC binding data, which indicate that the C-lobe-binding 5- and 6-phosphates contribute substantially more to binding, are consistent with the C-lobe playing a dominant role in substrate recruitment. This collection of structures and the binding data support the model that substrate recruitment likely occurs though the stable C-lobe, which comprises half of the IP-binding site. To complete assembly of the IP-binding site, IP must bind to both the N- and C-lobes, thereby coupling binding of the substrate to stabilization of the kinase. We further investigated the contribution of each phosphate group of the IP to its recognition as a substrate and to activation of IPK1. We determined the Km and kcat of IPK1 in the presence of IP5 and our series of IP4s. These data indicate that the kcat for IPK1 is substantially decreased for IPs lacking the 1- or 3-phosphate compared with IP5 and 1,3,4,6-IP4 (Table 2). Preliminary studies of IPK1 substrate specificity also revealed the use of 1,3,4,6-IP4 as a substrate, but not 3,4,5,6-IP4; however a kinetic analysis of IPK1 with each IP4 was not performed (14Sweetman D. Johnson S. Caddick S.E. Hanke D.E. Brearley C.A. Characterization of an Arabidopsis inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (AtIPK1).Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our observations are consistent with the 1- and 3-phosphates stabilizing the bilobed structure of IPK1, thereby promoting its activation though recruitment of the N-lobe using a mechanism similar to that reported for protein kinases (12Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Crystal structure of the Src family tyrosine kinase Hck.Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). IPK1 was unable to use 1,3,4,5-IP4 as a substrate, which suggests that the 6-position may play a dual role in both IP binding and activation; abolishing both functions decreased its use as a substrate to levels below the detection limit of our assay. The KD values for 1,3,4,5-IP4 and 1,3,4,6-IP4 were similar; however, 1,3,4,6-IP4 could be used as a substrate, whereas 1,3,4,5-IP4 could not. This indicates that the decreased binding affinity of 1,3,4,5-IP4 for IPK1 was not by itself the underlying factor for its inability to be used as a substrate (Table 1). The 6-phosphate-binding site plays a key role in IPK1 activation by preventing clasp formation (a critical step in the IPK1 catalytic cycle) in the absence of IP substrate. Binding of the 6-phosphate to Lys-200 disrupts the interaction between Lys-200 and Glu-255, and this newly freed Glu-255 binds to Trp-129, thereby promoting clasp formation between the L3 loop and α6 helix (13Baños-Sanz J.I. Sanz-Aparicio J. Whitfield H. Hamilton C. Brearley C.A. González B. Conformational changes in inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase upon substrate binding.

However, the K200A mutant, as well as other mutants that disrupted interaction with the 6-phosphate (K170A, N238A, and N239A), did not show any activity for 1,3,4,5-IP4, so intramolecular changes in the 6-phosphate-binding site are not essential for IPK1 activation (data not shown). It is possible that 1,3,4,5-IP4 adopts alternative binding orientations in which the 2′-hydroxyl is not accessible for phosphorylation (7Miller G.J. Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. Hurley J.H.

Further experimentation will be required to ascertain why 1,3,4,5-IP4 displays no activity. On the basis of previous crystal structures, we mutated each substrate-binding residue to alanine to determine the critical contacts between IPK1 and the IP. Each mutation abolished an interaction with one or two phosphates (Table 3), and we determined the Km and kcat for each mutant in the presence of IP5. The impacts of the mutations and the activities of the IP4s were largely symmetric; abolishing single contacts with a phosphate group through mutation had a similar impact as removing the phosphate from the substrate. A notable difference between the IPK1 mutant and IP4 data was the asymmetric impact of abolishing the interaction with the 1-phosphate. Given that Arg-130, located on the N-lobe, is the only residue that interacts with the 1-phosphate, we expected that an IP lacking the 1-phosphate would correspond with the activity of this mutant. However, the R130A mutant displayed no detectable activity, whereas 3,4,5,6-IP4 could be used by the wild-type enzyme, albeit with low activity (TABLE 2, TABLE 3). Structures of IPK1 in complex with IP show that Arg-130 forms a bond with Gly-254, establishing an interaction between the L3 loop and α6 helix and promoting clasp formation (Fig. 3) (9Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This interaction, and therefore clasp formation, cannot occur in the R130A mutant, rendering IPK1 inactive. Transient clasp formation can occur in wild-type IPK1, even in the absence of a 1-phosphate, which allows the use of 3,4,5,6-IP4 as a substrate with low activity. The 1-phosphate interaction with Arg-130 is conducive to clasp formation, thereby rendering IPK1 fully active (Fig. 3). Thus, the 1-phosphate stabilizes the active conformation of IPK1. There are 13 residues that interact with the IP in the IPK1 active site, either directly or indirectly through ordered water molecules, and each of these residues results in a bond to a phosphate group. For each phosphate of the IP, there is a contact residue that plays a critical role, and mutation of that residue abolishes activity. As discussed above, Arg-130 interacts with the 1-phosphate of the substrate and is a primary contact between the IP and the kinase N-lobe. Arg-130 is essential due to its structural role in stabilizing the active state and not exclusively for its role in binding the 1-phosphate, as 3,4,5,6-IP4 can bind and be recognized as a substrate. An IP lacking the 3-phosphate also displayed low activity; however, the R45A mutation, which disrupted the second contact between the IP and N-lobe, moderately impaired activity (Table 3). Thus, it appears that N-lobe interaction with IP is mediated primarily through Arg-130 and the 1-phosphate. Mutation of Lys-411, which interacts with both the 3- and 4-phosphates, was critical for activity, yet mutations of Arg-415 and Tyr-419, which mediate other interactions with the 4-phosphate, did not markedly affect IPK1 activity, nor did R45A, which is the second contact with the 3-phosphate, as described above (Table 3). Both the 5- and 6-phosphates bind to Lys-170, which is critical for activity; however, other 5-phosphate interactions with Arg-192 and His-196 and other 6-phosphate interactions with Lys-200, Asn-238, and Asn-239 are dispensable for activity. Wild-type IPK1 displayed activity with IPs lacking the 3- or 5-phosphate, yet mutations of Lys-170 and Lys-411 rendered IPK1 inactive, likely due to the fact that these residues bind more than one phosphate (TABLE 2, TABLE 3). Sequence alignments of IPK1 reveal that Arg-45, Arg-415, and Tyr-419 are the only inositide-binding residues that are not conserved among plant, human, rat, and yeast (8González B. Baños-Sanz J.I. Villate M. Brearley C.A. Sanz-Aparicio J. Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase is a distant IPK member with a singular inositide binding site for axial 2-OH recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Accordingly, R45A, R415A, and Y419A mutations retained at least 60% of wild-type activity. The conservation of Arg-130, but not Arg-45, suggests that N-lobe contact with the IP is mediated primarily through the 1-phosphate. In summary, our data indicate that each phosphate has a critical residue in the active site without which the enzyme cannot function, notably Arg-130, Lys-170, and Lys-411 (Table 3). Whether Lys-170 and Lys-411 impact binding affinity to the extent that substrate recognition cannot occur or if these residues play structural roles in shaping the binding site into an active conformation, as Arg-130 does, remains to be determined. Our previous crystal structures revealed that IPK1 possesses a stable C-lobe and a destabilized N-lobe in the absence of IP, such that the inositide-binding pocket remains partially formed (9Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We proposed a model wherein IPK1 links its interactions with IP substrate phosphate groups to stabilization of the N- and C-lobes and kinase activation. The stability of the C-lobe in the absence of IPs suggested that the roles of 4-, 5-, and 6-phosphates were to mediate the initial contact of the IP with IPK1. Our present study reveals that the 5- and 6-phosphates impact binding affinity more than the 1- and 3-phosphates. Our model also proposed that the 1- and 3-phosphates were required for N-lobe stabilization, as they act to bridge the N-lobe with the C-lobe. In our present study, IPK1 displayed substantially lower kcat values with 3,4,5,6-IP4 and 1,4,5,6-IP4 than with IP5 or an IP4 lacking the 5-phosphate. IP-free crystal structures of IPK1 reveal that the destabilization of the N-lobe is centered at Arg-130, which directly binds to the 1-phosphate of the IP substrate (9Gosein V. Leung T.F. Krajden O. Miller G.J. Inositol phosphate-induced stabilization of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase and its role in substrate specificity.Protein Sci. 2012; 21: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mutation of R130A impaired IPK1 activity, suggesting that the N-lobe is required to be stabilized for IPK1 activation, a key feature of kinase activation (12Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Crystal structure of the Src family tyrosine kinase Hck.Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). In short, our study reveals specific roles for each of the IP phosphates, linking IPK1 substrate specificity to IPK1 stability. In this work, we have demonstrated that the phosphate profile of IP5 is mechanistically linked to IPK1 activation. We have identified phosphates at the 1-, 3-, and 6-positions as the most important for activation of IPK1, whereas phosphates at the 5- and 6-positions are more important for binding than those at the 1- and 3-positions. Identification of the roles of the phosphates of the IP supports our proposed model of IPK1 substrate specificity and may provide a basis for selective targeting of IPK1, as similarity among IP substrates continues to hinder development of specific inhibitors for IPKs. Inhibition of IPK1 would prove valuable in the investigation of the roles of higher IPs whose production is dependent on inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate, the product of IPK1, as well as functional roles of IPK1 in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2161221399,"Osteocalcin (OC) and matrix Gla protein (MGP) are considered evolutionarily related because they share key structural features, although they have been described to exert different functions. In this work, we report the identification and characterization of both OC and MGP from the Adriatic sturgeon, a ray-finned fish characterized by a slow evolution and the retention of many ancestral features. Sturgeon MGP shows a primary structure, post-translation modifications, and patterns of mRNA/protein distribution and accumulation typical of known MGPs, and it contains seven possible Gla residues that would make the sturgeon protein the most γ-carboxylated among known MGPs. In contrast, sturgeon OC was found to present a hybrid structure. Indeed, although exhibiting protein domains typical of known OCs, it also contains structural features usually found in MGPs (e.g. a putative phosphorylated propeptide). Moreover, patterns of OC gene expression and protein accumulation overlap with those reported for MGP; OC was detected in bone cells and mineralized structures but also in soft and cartilaginous tissues. We propose that, in a context of a reduced rate of evolution, sturgeon OC has retained structural features of the ancestral protein that emerged millions of years ago from the duplication of an ancient MGP gene and may exhibit intermediate functional features."
