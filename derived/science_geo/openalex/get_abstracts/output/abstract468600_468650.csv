https://openalex.org/W2069932918,"Background Cryptococcus gattii infections are being reported in the United States (US) with increasing frequency. Initially, US reports were primarily associated with an ongoing C. gattii outbreak in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) states of Washington and Oregon, starting in 2004. However, reports of C. gattii infections in patients from other US states have been increasing since 2009. Whether this is due to increasing frequency of disease, greater recognition within the clinical community, or both is currently unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings During 2005–2013, a total of 273 C. gattii isolates from human and veterinary sources in 16 US states were collected. Of these, 214 (78%) were from the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and comprised primarily the clonal C. gattii genotypes VGIIa (64%), VGIIc (21%) and VGIIb (9%). The 59 isolates from outside the PNW were predominantly molecular types VGIII (44%) and VGI (41%). Genotyping using multilocus sequence typing revealed small clusters, including a cluster of VGI isolates from the southeastern US, and an unrelated cluster of VGI isolates and a large cluster of VGIII isolates from California. Most of the isolates were mating type MATα, including all of the VGII isolates, but one VGI and three VGIII isolates were mating type MATa. Conclusions/Significance We provide the most comprehensive report to date of genotypic diversity of US C. gattii isolates both inside and outside of the PNW. C. gattii may have multiple endemic regions in the US, including a previously-unrecognized endemic region in the southeast. Regional clusters exist both in California and the Southeastern US. VGII strains associated with the PNW outbreak do not appear to have spread substantially beyond the PNW."
https://openalex.org/W2001309836,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is extensively expressed in head and neck cancer. However, EGFR-targeted therapy has only modest efficacy in head and neck cancer, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Here, we found that inhibition of EGFR by erlotinib stimulated phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 leading to increased Bcl2/Bcl-XL expression in head and neck cancer cells, which may dampen the therapeutic efficacy of erlotinib against head and neck cancer. Erlotinib-enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation results, at least in part, from suppression of its physiological phosphatase, PTPMeg2. Specific knockdown of STAT3 by RNA interference significantly sensitized head and neck cancer cells to erlotinib treatment. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 by niclosamide not only blocked erlotinib-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation but also synergistically repressed head and neck cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Combined inhibition of EGFR and STAT3 by erlotinib and niclosamide more effectively induced apoptosis in tumor tissues without toxicity for normal tissues. Based on our findings, treatment with erlotinib combined with niclosamide may offer an effective therapeutic approach to improve the prognosis of head and neck cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2123579927,"The interface between bone and connective tissues such as the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) constitutes a complex transition traversing multiple tissue regions, including non-calcified and calcified fibrocartilage, which integrates and enables load transfer between otherwise structurally and functionally distinct tissue types. The objective of this study was to investigate region-dependent changes in collagen, proteoglycan and mineral distribution, as well as collagen orientation, across the ligament-to-bone insertion site using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIR-I). Insertion site-related differences in matrix content were also evaluated by comparing tibial and femoral entheses. Both region- and site-related changes were observed. Collagen content was higher in the ligament and bone regions, while decreasing across the fibrocartilage interface. Moreover, interfacial collagen fibrils were aligned parallel to the ligament-bone interface near the ligament region, assuming a more random orientation through the bulk of the interface. Proteoglycan content was uniform on average across the insertion, while its distribution was relatively less variable at the tibial compared to the femoral insertion. Mineral was only detected in the calcified interface region, and its content increased exponentially across the mineralized fibrocartilage region toward bone. In addition to new insights into matrix composition and organization across the complex multi-tissue junction, findings from this study provide critical benchmarks for the regeneration of soft tissue-to-bone interfaces and integrative soft tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W2041261723,"Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a severe, vision-threatening disorder characterized by the fibrous membrane formation that leads to tractional retinal detachment. There has been no effective therapeutic approach other than vitreoretinal surgery. In this study, DNA microarray analysis of the fibrous membranes revealed significant up-regulation of periostin. We also found increased periostin expression in the vitreous and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells from fibrous membranes of PVR patients. In vitro, periostin increased proliferation, adhesion, migration, and collagen production in RPE cells through integrin αV-mediated FAK and AKT phosphorylation. Periostin blockade suppressed migration and adhesion induced by TGFβ2 and PVR vitreous. In vivo, periostin inhibition had the inhibitory effect on progression of experimental PVR in rabbit eyes without affecting the viability of retinal cells. These results identified periostin as a pivotal molecule for fibrous membrane formation as well as a promising therapeutic target for PVR."
https://openalex.org/W2093026971,"Recently, the roles of SIRT1 and deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) in human cancer have been extensively studied and it has been demonstrated that they are involved in many human carcinomas. However, their clinical significance for soft-tissue sarcomas has not been examined. In this study, we evaluated the expression and prognostic significance of the expression of SIRT1, DBC1, P53, β-catenin, cyclin D1, and KI67 in 104 cases of soft-tissue sarcomas.Immunohistochemical expression of SIRT1, DBC1, P53, β-catenin, and cyclin D1 were seen in 71%, 74%, 53%, 48%, and 73% of sarcomas, respectively. The expression of SIRT1, DBC1, P53, β-catenin, and cyclin D1 were significantly correlated with advanced clinicopathological parameters such as higher clinical stage, higher histological grade, increased mitotic counts, and distant metastasis. The expression of SIRT1, DBC1, P53, β-catenin, cyclin D1, and KI67 were significantly correlated with each other and positive expression of all of these predicted shorter overall survival and event-free survival by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed the expression of SIRT1 as an independent prognostic indicator for overall survival and event-free survival of sarcoma patients. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SIRT1- and DBC1-related pathways may be involved in the progression of soft-tissue sarcomas and can be used as clinically significant prognostic indicators for sarcoma patients. Moreover, the SIRT1- and DBC1-related pathways could be new therapeutic targets for the treatment of sarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W1994057593,"Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that over-expression of human insulin-like growth factor -1 (hIGF-1) in the placenta corrects fetal weight deficits in mouse, rat, and rabbit models of intrauterine growth restriction without changes in placental weight. The underlying mechanisms of this effect have not been elucidated. To investigate the effect of intra-placental IGF-1 over-expression on placental function we examined glucose transporter expression and localization in both a mouse model of IUGR and a model of human trophoblast, the BeWo Choriocarcinoma cell line. Methods At gestational day 18, animals were divided into four groups; sham-operated controls, uterine artery branch ligation (UABL), UABL+Ad-hIGF-1 (108 PFU), UABL+Ad-LacZ (108 PFU). At gestational day 20, pups and placentas were harvested by C-section. For human studies, BeWo choriocarcinoma cells were grown in F12 complete medium +10%FBS. Cells were incubated in serum-free control media ±Ad-IGF-1 or Ad-LacZ for 48 hours. MOIs of 10∶1 and 100∶1 were utilized. The RNA, protein expression and localization of glucose transporters GLUT1, 3, 8, and 9 were analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results In both the mouse placenta and BeWo, GLUT1 regulation was linked to altered protein localization. GLUT3, localized to the mouse fetal endothelial cells, was reduced in placental insufficiency but maintained with Ad-I GF-1 treatment. Interestingly, GLUT8 expression was reduced in the UABL placenta but up-regulated following Ad-IGF-1 in both mouse and human systems. GLUT9 expression in the mouse was increased by Ad-IGF-1 but this was not reflected in the BeWo, where Ad-IGF-1 caused moderate membrane relocalization. Conclusion Enhanced GLUT isoform transporter expression and relocalization to the membrane may be an important mechanism in Ad-hIGF-1mediated correction of placental insufficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2078972738,"The cost of American medical education has increased substantially over the past decade. Given racial/ethnic inequalities in access to financial resources, it is plausible that increases in student debt burden resulting from these increases in cost may not be borne equally.To evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in medical student debt.Authors collected self-reported data from a non-representative sample of 2414 medical students enrolled at 111/159 accredited US medical schools between December 1(st) 2010 and March 27(th) 2011. After weighting for representativeness by race and class year and calculating crude anticipated debt by racial/ethnic category, authors fit multivariable regression models of debt by race/ethnicity adjusted for potential confounders.Anticipated educational debt upon graduation greater than $150,000.62.1% of medical students anticipated debt in excess of $150,000 upon graduation. The proportion of Blacks, Whites, Hispanics, and Asians reporting anticipated educational debt in excess of $150,000 was 77.3%, 65.1%, 57.2% and 50.2%, respectively. Both Black and White medical students demonstrated a significantly higher likelihood of anticipated debt in excess of $150,000 when compared to Asians [Blacks (OR=2.7, 1.3-5.6), Whites (OR=1.7, 1.3-2.2)] in adjusted models.Black medical students had significantly higher anticipated debt than Asian students. This finding has implications for understanding differential enrollment among minority groups in US medical schools."
https://openalex.org/W1963901744,"In contrast to mammals, most reptiles constantly regenerate their teeth. In the snake, the epithelial dental lamina ends in a successional lamina, which proliferates and elongates forming multiple tooth generations, all linked by a permanent dental lamina. To investigate the mechanisms used to control the initiation of new tooth germs in an ordered sequential pattern we utilized the polyphodont (multiple-generation) corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus). We observed that the dental lamina expressed the transcription factor Sox2, a multipotent stem cell marker, whereas the successional lamina cells expressed the transcription factor Lef1, a Wnt/β-catenin pathway target gene. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in culture increased the number of developing tooth germs, in comparison to control untreated cultures. These additional tooth germs budded off from ectopic positions along the dental lamina, rather than in an ordered sequence from the successional lamina. Wnt/β-catenin activation enhanced cell proliferation, particularly in normally non-odontogenic regions of the dental lamina, which widely expressed Lef1, restricting the Sox2 domain. This suggests an expansion of the successional lamina at the expense of the dental lamina. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in cultured snake dental organs, therefore, led to changes in proliferation and to the molecular pattern of the dental lamina, resulting in loss of the organised emergence of tooth germs. These results suggest that epithelial compartments are critical for the arrangement of organs that develop in sequence, and highlight the role of Wnt/β-catenin signalling in such processes."
https://openalex.org/W2089583284,"Increasing evidence suggests that high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) promote hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway is important in hypoxia and is modulated post-translationally by prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1-PHD3) and E3 ubiquitin ligases (Siah1 and Siah2). We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which HDLs augment hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. Preincubation (16 h) of human coronary artery endothelial cells with reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) containing apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and phosphatidylcholine (20 μM, final apoA-I concentration), before hypoxia, increased Siah1 (58%) and Siah2 (88%) mRNA levels and suppressed PHD2 (32%) and PHD3 (45%) protein levels compared with hypoxia-induced control levels. After Siah1/2 small interfering RNA knockdown, rHDL was unable to suppress PHD2/3 and failed to induce HIF-1α, VEGF, and tubulogenesis in hypoxia. Inhibition of the upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway also abrogated the effects of rHDL. Furthermore, knockdown of the scavenger receptor SR-BI attenuated rHDL-induced elevations in Siah1/2 and tubulogenesis in hypoxia, indicating that SR-BI plays a key role. Finally, the importance of VEGF in mediating the ability of rHDL to drive hypoxia-induced angiogenesis was confirmed using a VEGF-neutralizing antibody. In summary, rHDL augments the HIF-1α/VEGF pathway via SR-BI and modulation of the post-translational regulators of HIF-1α (PI3K/Siahs/PHDs). HDL-induced augmentation of angiogenesis in hypoxia may have implications for therapeutic modulation of ischemic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2032981849,"Phytophthora capsici is a soilborne plant pathogen capable of infecting a wide range of plants, including many solanaceous crops. However, genetic resistance and fungicides often fail to manage P. capsici due to limited knowledge on the molecular biology and basis of P. capsici pathogenicity. To begin to rectify this situation, Illumina RNA-Seq was used to perform massively parallel sequencing of three cDNA samples derived from P. capsici mycelia (MY), zoospores (ZO) and germinating cysts with germ tubes (GC). Over 11 million reads were generated for each cDNA library analyzed. After read mapping to the gene models of P. capsici reference genome, 13,901, 14,633 and 14,695 putative genes were identified from the reads of the MY, ZO and GC libraries, respectively. Comparative analysis between two of samples showed major differences between the expressed gene content of MY, ZO and GC stages. A large number of genes associated with specific stages and pathogenicity were identified, including 98 predicted effector genes. The transcriptional levels of 19 effector genes during the developmental and host infection stages of P. capsici were validated by RT-PCR. Ectopic expression in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that P. capsici RXLR and Crinkler effectors can suppress host cell death triggered by diverse elicitors including P. capsici elicitin and NLP effectors. This study provides a first look at the transcriptome and effector arsenal of P. capsici during the important pre-infection stages."
https://openalex.org/W1987233085,"Genes encoding the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been thought to play a vital role in the adaptive immune system in all vertebrates. The discovery that Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) has lost important components of the MHC II pathway, accompanied by an unusually high number of MHC I genes, shed new light on the evolution and plasticity of the immune system of teleosts as well as in higher vertebrates. The overall aim of this study was to further investigate the highly expanded repertoire of MHC I genes using a cDNA approach to obtain sequence information of both the binding domains and the sorting signaling potential in the cytoplasmic tail. Here we report a novel combination of two endosomal sorting motifs, one tyrosine-based associated with exogenous peptide presentation by cross-presenting MHCI molecules, and one dileucine-based associated with normal MHC II functionality. The two signal motifs were identified in the cytoplasmic tail in a subset of the genes. This indicates that these genes have evolved MHC II-like functionality, allowing a more versatile use of MHC I through cross-presentation. Such an alternative immune strategy may have arisen through adaptive radiation and acquisition of new gene function as a response to changes in the habitat of its ancestral lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2062703082,"Background Low serum magnesium concentrations have been associated with cardiovascular disease risk and outcomes in some general population studies but there are no equivalent studies in diabetes. Metformin may have cardiovascular benefits beyond blood glucose lowering in type 2 diabetes but its association with hypomagnesemia appears paradoxical. The aim of this study was to examine relationships between metformin therapy, magnesium homoeostasis and cardiovascular disease in well-characterized type 2 patients from the community. Methods and Findings We studied 940 non-insulin-treated patients (mean±SD age 63.4±11.6 years, 49.0% males) from the longitudinal observational Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase I (FDS1) who were followed for 12.3±5.3 years. Baseline serum magnesium was measured using stored sera. Multivariate methods were used to determine associates of prevalent and incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) as ascertained from self-report and linked morbidity/mortality databases. 19% of patients were hypomagnesemic (serum magnesium <0.70 mmol/L). Patients on metformin, alone or combined with a sulfonylurea, had lower serum magnesium concentrations than those on diet alone (P<0.05). There were no independent associations between serum magnesium or metformin therapy and either CHD or CVD at baseline. Incident CVD, but not CHD, was independently and inversely associated with serum magnesium (hazard ratio (95% CI) 0.28 (0.11–0.74); P = 0.010), but metformin therapy was not a significant variable in these models. Conclusions Since hypomagnesemia appears to be an independent risk factor for CVD complicating type 2 diabetes, the value of replacement therapy should be investigated further, especially in patients at high CVD risk."
https://openalex.org/W1804468462,"Cytosolic carboxypeptidase 5 (CCP5) is a member of a subfamily of enzymes that cleave C-terminal and/or side chain amino acids from tubulin. CCP5 was proposed to selectively cleave the branch point of glutamylated tubulin, based on studies involving overexpression of CCP5 in cell lines and detection of tubulin forms with antisera. In the present study, we examined the activity of purified CCP5 toward synthetic peptides as well as soluble α- and β-tubulin and paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules using a combination of antisera and mass spectrometry to detect the products. Mouse CCP5 removes multiple glutamate residues and the branch point glutamate from the side chains of porcine brain α- and β-tubulin. In addition, CCP5 excised C-terminal glutamates from detyrosinated α-tubulin. The enzyme also removed multiple glutamate residues from side chains and C termini of paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules. CCP5 both shortens and removes side chain glutamates from synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of β3-tubulin, whereas cytosolic carboxypeptidase 1 shortens the side chain without cleaving the peptides' γ-linked residues. The rate of cleavage of α linkages by CCP5 is considerably slower than that of removal of a single γ-linked glutamate residue. Collectively, our data show that CCP5 functions as a dual-functional deglutamylase cleaving both α- and γ-linked glutamate from tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W2005379932,"Aldose reductase (AR) is an NADPH-dependent reductase, which acts on a variety of hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic aldehydes. It is currently defined as the first enzyme in the so-called polyol pathway, in which glucose is transformed into sorbitol by AR and then to fructose by an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase. An exaggerated flux of glucose through the polyol pathway (as can occur in diabetes) with the subsequent accumulation of sorbitol, was originally proposed as the basic event in the aethiology of secondary diabetic complications. For decades this has meant targeting the enzyme for a specific and strong inhibition. However, the ability of AR to reduce toxic alkenals and alkanals, which are products of oxidative stress, poses the question of whether AR might be better classified as a detoxifying enzyme, thus raising doubts as to the unequivocal advantages of inhibiting the enzyme. This paper provides evidence of the possibility for an effective intervention on AR activity through an intra-site differential inhibition. Examples of a new generation of aldose reductase “differential” inhibitors (ARDIs) are presented, which can preferentially inhibit the reduction of either hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates. Some selected inhibitors are shown to preferentially inhibit enzyme activity on glucose or glyceraldehyde and 3-glutathionyl-4-hydroxy-nonanal, but are less effective in reducing 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. We question the efficacy of D, L-glyceraldehyde, the substrate commonly used in in vitro inhibition AR studies, as an in vitro reference AR substrate when the aim of the investigation is to impair glucose reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1987840785,"Connexin channels play a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and transparency of the lens. Mutations in connexin genes are linked to congenital cataracts in humans. The G143R missense mutation on connexin (Cx) 46 was recently reported to be associated with congenital Coppock cataracts. Here, we showed that the G143R mutation decreased Cx46 gap junctional coupling in a dominant negative manner; however, it significantly increased gap junctional plaques. The G143R mutant also increased hemichannel activity, inversely correlated with the level of Cx46 protein on the cell surface. The interaction between cytoplasmic loop domain and C-terminus has been shown to be involved in gating of connexin channels. Interestingly, the G143R mutation enhanced the interaction between intracellular loop and Cx46. Furthermore, this mutation decreased cell viability and the resistance of the cells to oxidative stress, primarily due to the increased hemichannel function. Together, these results suggest that mutation of this highly conserved residue on the cytoplasmic loop domain of Cx46 enhances its interaction with the C-terminus, resulting in a reduction of gap junction channel function, but increased hemichannel function. This combination leads to the development of human congenital cataracts."
https://openalex.org/W1967871170,"The recently-identified fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) protein is associated with various physiological functions including energy and body weight regulation. Ubiquitously expressed, FTO was identified in heart homogenates although its function is unknown. We studied whether FTO is specifically expressed within the cardiac myocyte and its potential role pertaining to the hypertrophic effect of the adipokine leptin. Most experiments were performed using cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes which showed nuclei-specific FTO expression. Leptin significantly increased FTO expression which was associated with myocyte hypertrophy although both events were abrogated by FTO knockdown with siRNA. Administration of a leptin receptor antibody to either normal or obese rats significant reduced myocardial FTO protein expression. Responses in cardiomyocytes were accompanied by JAK2/STAT3 activation whereas JAK2/STAT3 inhibition abolished these effects. Expression of the cut-like homeobox 1(CUX1) transcriptional factor was significantly increased by leptin although this was restricted to the cathepsin L-dependent, proteolytically-derived shorter p110CUX1 isoform whereas the longer p200CUX1 protein was not significantly affected. Cathepsin L expression and activity were both significantly increased by leptin whereas a cathepsin L peptide inhibitor or siRNA specific for CUX1 completely prevented the leptin-induced increase in FTO expression. The cathepsin L peptide inhibitor or siRNA-induced knockdown of either CUX1 or FTO abrogated the hypertrophic response to leptin. Two other pro-hypertrophic factors, endothelin-1 or angiotensin II had no effect on FTO expression and FTO knockdown did not alter the hypertrophic response to either agent. This study demonstrates leptin-induced FTO upregulation in cardiomyocytes via JAK2/STAT3- dependent CUX1 upregulation and suggests an FTO regulatory function of leptin. It also demonstrates for the first time a functional role of FTO in the cardiomyocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2117497307,"Marine fish and shellfish are primary sources of human exposure to mercury, a potentially toxic metal, and selenium, an essential element that may protect against mercury bioaccumulation and toxicity. Yet we lack a thorough understanding of Hg and Se patterns in common marine taxa, particularly those that are commercially important, and how food web and body size factors differ in their influence on Hg and Se patterns. We compared Hg and Se content among marine fish and invertebrate taxa collected from Long Island, NY, and examined associations between Hg, Se, body length, trophic level (measured by δ(15)N) and degree of pelagic feeding (measured by δ(13)C). Finfish, particularly shark, had high Hg content whereas bivalves generally had high Se content. Both taxonomic differences and variability were larger for Hg than Se, and Hg content explained most of the variation in Hg:Se molar ratios among taxa. Finally, Hg was more strongly associated with length and trophic level across taxa than Se, consistent with a greater degree of Hg bioaccumulation in the body over time, and biomagnification through the food web, respectively. Overall, our findings indicate distinct taxonomic and ecological Hg and Se patterns in commercially important marine biota, and these patterns have nutritional and toxicological implications for seafood-consuming wildlife and humans."

In Mutant Ins-gene-induced Diabetes of Youth (MIDY), misfolded mutant proinsulin impairs ER exit of co-expressed wild-type proinsulin, limiting insulin production and leading to eventual β-cell death. In this study we have investigated the hypothesis that increased expression of ER oxidoreductin-1α (Ero1α), despite its established role in the generation of H2O2, might nevertheless be beneficial in limiting proinsulin misfolding and its adverse downstream consequences. Increased Ero1α expression is effective in promoting wild-type proinsulin export from cells co-expressing misfolded mutant proinsulin. In addition, we find that upon increased Ero1α expression, some of the MIDY mutants themselves are directly rescued from ER retention. Secretory rescue of proinsulin-G(B23)V is correlated with improved oxidative folding of mutant proinsulin. Indeed, using three different variants of Ero1α, we find that expression of either wild-type or an Ero1α variant lacking regulatory disulfides can rescue mutant proinsulin-G(B23)V, in parallel with its ability to provide an oxidizing environment in the ER lumen, whereas beneficial effects were less apparent for a redox-inactive form of Ero1.

Commun. 2010; 391: 1449-1454Google Scholar); moreover, misfolded mutant proinsulin molecules exert a dominant-negative effect on the export of co-expressed wild-type molecules through direct association (8.Liu M.

Targeted disruption of the Chop gene delays endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated diabetes.J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 525-532Google Scholar). In recent years increasing attention has been paid to the role of ER oxidoreductin-1 (Ero1) in promoting the oxidative folding of proinsulin in the ER (13.Zito E. Chin K.T. Blais J. Harding H.P. Ron D. ERO1β, a pancreas-specific disulfide oxidase, promotes insulin biogenesis and glucose homeostasis.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 821-832Google Scholar, 14.Khoo C. Yang J. Rajpal G. Wang Y. Liu J.

Endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin-1-like β (ERO1lβ) regulates susceptibility to endoplasmic reticulum stress and is induced by insulin flux in β-cells.Endocrinology. 2011; 152: 2599-2608Google Scholar). Mammals express two isoforms of Ero1 (α and β); both are ER luminal flavoproteins that couple reduction of molecular oxygen with the oxidation of ER oxidoreductases such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (15.Ramming T. Appenzeller-Herzog C. The physiological functions of mammalian endoplasmic oxidoreductin 1. On disulfides and more.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2012; 16: 1109-1118Google Scholar). In turn, the ER oxidoreductases can shuttle disulfide bonds to substrates to catalyze the folding of newly synthesized secretory proteins (16.Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Biochemical basis of oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Google Scholar, 17.Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Formation and transfer of disulphide bonds in living cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 836-847Google Scholar), such as proinsulin (2.Rajpal G. Schuiki I. Liu M. Volchuk A. Arvan P. Action of protein disulfide isomerase on proinsulin exit from endoplasmic reticulum of pancreatic β-cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 43-47Google Scholar). Among other pathways, Ero1 is the best-known source of disulfide bonds in the ER lumen (18.Bulleid N.J. Ellgaard L. Multiple ways to make disulfides.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 485-492Google Scholar). Because Ero1 deficiency impairs proinsulin maturation and predisposes to insulin-deficient diabetes (13.Zito E. Chin K.T. Blais J. Harding H.P. Ron D. ERO1β, a pancreas-specific disulfide oxidase, promotes insulin biogenesis and glucose homeostasis.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 821-832Google Scholar), it occurred to us that improved proinsulin oxidative folding may provide a novel approach to ameliorating insulin production, especially under states of ER stress in which misfolded proinsulin may block export of bystander proinsulin molecules (19.Liu M. Lara-Lemus R. Shan S.O. Wright J. Haataja L. Barbetti F. Guo H. Larkin D. Arvan P. Impaired cleavage of preproinsulin signal peptide linked to autosomal-dominant diabetes.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 828-837Google Scholar). Propelled by the hypothesis that improvement of proinsulin folding kinetics may overcome ER retention of both mutant and WT molecules, in this study we have examined the effect(s) of increased Ero1α expression on misfolded proinsulin in the ER. The results suggest that manipulating the β-cell ER proteome may provide a therapeutic window though which proinsulin misfolding may be ameliorated. 293T cells were cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml; 100 μg/ml). INS1E cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, penicillin/streptomycin (as above), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells were stably transfected with empty vector, Ero1α-WT, or Ero1α-Active as previously described (20.Appenzeller-Herzog C. Riemer J. Christensen B. Sørensen E.S. Ellgaard L. A novel disulphide switch mechanism in Ero1α balances ER oxidation in human cells.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2977-2987Google Scholar) and maintained in MEM (Sigma, M4526) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (as above), 1× GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 7.5 μg/ml blasticidin, and 50 μg/ml hygromycin. For induction of gene expression, cells were incubated in complete media containing 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h. Proinsulin variants were expressed in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or pTarget (Promega), Ero1α variants were expressed in pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen), roGFP-iE(ER) was expressed in pcDNA3.1, and PDI-FLAG was expressed in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA. All plasmids have been previously described except Ero1α-C94A, -C99A, -C104A, -C131A, -C394A, and -C397A (“Ero1α-Hex”), which were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). Plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 293T cells or Metafectene Pro (Biontex) for INS1E and Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells. Total plasmid DNA amount was held constant within each experiment by inclusion of empty vector. For secretion experiments, 24–48 h post-transfection culture medium was changed and collected overnight. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 0.2% deoxycholate, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture). Proinsulin was measured by rat insulin radioimmunoassay (RIA, Millipore) that recognizes insulins and proinsulins of multiple species or human proinsulin-specific RIA (Millipore) normalized to total cell protein measured by BCA assay (Pierce). For immunoblotting, proteins (10 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% acrylamide gradient gels (NuPAGE), electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with either anti-Ero1α (Santa Cruz), anti-Myc (Immunology Consultant Laboratories), or anti-α-tubulin as a loading control (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch, with proteins visualized by ECL (Millipore). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were starved in DMEM lacking cysteine and methionine for 30 min. After pulse-labeling with 35S-labeled cysteine and methionine as indicated, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc or anti-insulin antibodies and protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were separated by reducing or non-reducing Tris-Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography as previously described (21.Liu M. Ramos-Castañeda J. Arvan P. Role of the connecting peptide in insulin biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14798-14805Google Scholar). For both immunoblotting and metabolic labeling, gel bands were quantified using ImageQuant software. Oxidation of the ER in Flp-In TRex 293 cells using the HyPerER sensor and in INS1E cells using Grx1-roGFP1-iEER was measured as previously described (22.Birk J. Meyer M. Aller I. Hansen H.G. Odermatt A. Dick T.P. Meyer A.J. Appenzeller-Herzog C. Endoplasmic reticulum. Reduced and oxidized glutathione revisited.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 1604-1617Google Scholar, 23.Birk J. Ramming T. Odermatt A. Appenzeller-Herzog C. Green fluorescent protein-based monitoring of endoplasmic reticulum redox poise.Front. Genet. 2013; 4: 108Google Scholar). Briefly, Flp-In TRex 293 cells were stably transfected with plasmid expressing the HyPerER sensor (24.Enyedi B. Várnai P. Geiszt M. Redox state of the endoplasmic reticulum is controlled by Ero1Lα and intraluminal calcium.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 13: 721-729Google Scholar) as previously described (23.Birk J. Ramming T. Odermatt A. Appenzeller-Herzog C. Green fluorescent protein-based monitoring of endoplasmic reticulum redox poise.Front. Genet. 2013; 4: 108Google Scholar). After induction of expression of Ero1α variants with 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h, fluorescence spectra were obtained at steady state or in the presence of 10 mm DTT or 100 μm H2O2, with excitation ranging from 410 to 510 nm and emission at 535 nm. The ratios of fluorescence emission intensities upon excitation at 500 nm and at 420 nm from independent experiments were logarithmically transformed and fitted to a linear model using a batch-specific offset value with calculation as previously described (23.Birk J. Ramming T. Odermatt A. Appenzeller-Herzog C. Green fluorescent protein-based monitoring of endoplasmic reticulum redox poise.Front. Genet. 2013; 4: 108Google Scholar). INS1E cells were co-transfected with Ero1α variant or empty vector and Grx1-roGFP1-iEER, washed, and incubated in PBS containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide on ice for 20 min and lysed on ice for 1 h in 100 mm NaPO4, pH 8, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After removal of insoluble cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was immunoprecipitated using sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated agarose (Thermo Scientific) decorated with anti-GFP. Samples were separated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-HA antibodies. Blots were analyzed densitometrically to determine the percentage of oxidized sensor (22.Birk J. Meyer M. Aller I. Hansen H.G. Odermatt A. Dick T.P. Meyer A.J. Appenzeller-Herzog C. Endoplasmic reticulum. Reduced and oxidized glutathione revisited.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 1604-1617Google Scholar). 24 h post-transfection with proinsulin, Ero1α, and BiP promoter-driven luciferase expression plasmids, cells were split into 2 separate wells. One well was lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase was measured using the Dual-Light kit (Promega); the other was lysed in Buffer RLT and homogenized using QIAShredder (Qiagen). RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen); cDNA was generated using the Superscript III First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RT-quantitative PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green (Invitrogen) with human proinsulin-specific primers: 5′-CGCAGCCTTTGTGAACCAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGGTGTGTAGAAGAAGCCTC-3′ (reverse). Luciferase activity was normalized directly to human proinsulin mRNA levels. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism software. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise noted. Two-tailed Student's t test was used to assess statistical significance, with a threshold for significance of p < 0.05. For analysis of HyPerER data, linear regression, 95% confidence intervals, and p values were all calculated using Microsoft Excel. MIDY mutations cause proinsulin to act as a dominant-negative mutant that inhibits WT insulin production (6.Hodish I. Liu M. Rajpal G. Larkin D. Holz R.W. Adams A. Liu L. Arvan P.

In vitro processing and secretion of mutant insulin proteins that cause permanent neonatal diabetes.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 298: E403-E410Google Scholar), an effect that may be reversed upon increased expression of Ero1β and even more by Ero1α (19.Liu M. Lara-Lemus R. Shan S.O. Wright J. Haataja L. Barbetti F. Guo H. Larkin D. Arvan P. Impaired cleavage of preproinsulin signal peptide linked to autosomal-dominant diabetes.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 828-837Google Scholar). To examine more closely the effect of increased Ero1 expression on this dominant-negative behavior, we co-transfected the INS1E β-cell line with wild-type human proinsulin tagged with a myc-epitope (hPro-CpepMyc) plus either WT or mutant mouse proinsulin. As previously reported (8.Liu M. Haataja L. Wright J. Wickramasinghe N.P. Hua Q.X. Phillips N.F. Barbetti F. Weiss M.A. Arvan P. Mutant INS-gene induced diabetes of youth. Proinsulin cysteine residues impose dominant-negative inhibition on wild-type proinsulin transport.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e13333Google Scholar), mouse mutant proinsulins C(A7)Y or G(B23)V each impaired secretion of co-expressed human WT proinsulin, as measured by human proinsulin-specific radioimmunoassay (Fig. 1). However, co-transfection of Ero1α in β-cells rescued secretion of WT proinsulin in the presence of mutant proinsulins C(A7)Y or G(B23)V (Fig. 1). We wished to determine if prevention of dominant-negative behavior involves primarily Ero1 activity on WT proinsulin or if it might also be attributed to direct effects on mutant proinsulin molecules. With this in mind, we examined the effect of increased Ero1α expression on the secretion of a variety of MIDY mutant proinsulins expressed in 293T cells in which WT proinsulin is not co-expressed. Remarkably, several proinsulin mutants including G(B8)S and G(B23)V were rescued upon increased expression of Ero1α, whereas others including L(B11)P and C(A7)Y could not be rescued (Fig. 2 lanes 6 and 10 versus lanes 7 and 14). When examining the different transiently transfected samples, it was clear that the greatest magnitude of secretion rescue did not correlate with samples bearing the highest levels of Ero1α protein; rather, these results suggest that increased Ero1α can augment secretion of a subset of MIDY mutants in a manner that depends primarily upon the precise mutation perturbing proinsulin folding. Wild-type proinsulin can dimerize with mutant proinsulin (25.Haataja L. Snapp E. Wright J. Liu M. Hardy A.B. Wheeler M.B. Markwardt M.L. Rizzo M. Arvan P. Proinsulin intermolecular interactions during secretory trafficking in pancreatic β cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 1896-1906Google Scholar), and wild-type proinsulin can also augment secretion of a similar subset of misfolded MIDY mutants (26.Wright J. Wang X. Haataja L. Kellogg A.P. Lee J. Liu M. Arvan P. Dominant protein interactions that influence the pathogenesis of conformational diseases.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3124-3134Google Scholar). We wished to pursue whether Ero1-mediated secretion rescue phenocopied the effects of WT proinsulin; with this in mind, we examined the effects of these treatments individually, or together on mutant proinsulin secretion. In the presence of WT proinsulin, we observed a modest (∼3-fold) increase in secretion of the MIDY mutant proinsulin-G(B23)V (Fig. 3A, second bar). Upon increased Ero1α expression, we observed a much greater increase in proinsulin-G(B23)V secretion (Fig. 3A, third bar). When the two treatments were combined, the resulting increase in proinsulin-G(B23)V secretion appeared additive (fourth bar). Thus, although secretory rescue may be achieved for the same mutants by both methods, the data imply that Ero1 and WT proinsulin may rescue misfolded proinsulin by distinct mechanisms. To examine how increased expression of Ero1 impacts on proinsulin-G(B23)V folding, we co-transfected 293T cells with hProG(B23)V-CpepMyc plus Ero1α or empty vector and metabolically labeled newly synthesized proteins with 35S-labeled amino acids. Immunoprecipitated proinsulin was then analyzed by nonreducing Tris-Tricine-Urea-SDS-PAGE. Proinsulin-WT can be resolved into differentially migrating bands (Fig. 3B, lower panel), the fastest of which comprises the majority and represents native proinsulin; the slowest represents fully reduced proinsulin, and intermediate bands represent incompletely or improperly folded proinsulin disulfide isomers (3.Liu M. Li Y. Cavener D. Arvan P. Proinsulin disulfide maturation and misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13209-13212Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, all oxidized/partially oxidized proinsulin bands migrate as a single reduced band (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). Under nonreducing conditions, the fraction of proinsulin-G(B23)V that achieved the native disulfide-bonded form was <10% of all molecules (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Importantly, when Ero1α was co-transfected, the fraction of proinsulin-G(B23)V achieving a native-like mobility was notably increased (Fig. 3B, lane 3), although the fraction of non-native isoforms still remained greater than that seen for WT proinsulin (lane 1). Moreover, upon pulse-labeling and a 2-h chase, much of the secreted proinsulin-G(B23)V from cells co-transfected with Ero1α migrated under nonreducing conditions like WT proinsulin, comparable in mobility to the native-like intracellular species (Fig. 3C). This result contrasts with that from control cells co-transfected with empty vector, in which no bands of secreted proinsulin-G(B23)V could be detected (not shown). In 293T cells, co-transfection with Ero1α plasmid typically caused the synthesis of labeled proinsulin-G(B23)V to appear diminished (Fig. 3B, lane 3, reduced sample); this was less evident in β-cells and was not correlated with increased ER stress (see below) but may reflect competition between CMV promoters from different plasmids. However, decreased synthesis of proinsulin-G(B23)V in 293T cells cannot readily explain its increased secretion from the same cells (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Rather, secretory rescue by Ero1α is correlated with increased oxidation of proinsulin-G(B23)V. Oxidase activity of Ero1α involving the communicating Cys-394–Cys-397 and Cys-94–Cys-99 active-site disulfides is negatively regulated by alternative disulfide linkages involving Cys residues at positions 104 and 131 (20.Appenzeller-Herzog C. Riemer J. Christensen B. Sørensen E.S. Ellgaard L. A novel disulphide switch mechanism in Ero1α balances ER oxidation in human cells.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2977-2987Google Scholar, 27.Hansen H.G.

Hyperactivity of the Ero1α oxidase elicits endoplasmic reticulum stress but no broad antioxidant response.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 39513-39523Google Scholar). We utilized a plasmid expressing Ero1αMycHis6 with the regulatory Cys residues mutated to Ala; this construct (herein called Ero1α-Active) has been shown to have increased activity compared with Ero1α-WT (27.Hansen H.G. Schmidt J.D. Søltoft C.L. Ramming T. Geertz-Hansen H.M. Christensen B. Sørensen E.S. Juncker A.S. Appenzeller-Herzog C. Ellgaard L.

Langton K.P. Sheppard A.M. Lu H. Bulleid N.J. Low reduction potential of Ero1α regulatory disulphides ensures tight control of substrate oxidation.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2988-2997Google Scholar). We also mutated the four active sites plus the two regulatory Cys residues in a construct called Ero1α-Hex (Fig. 4A) that lacks the ability to generate disulfide bonds. As measured by immunoblotting, unlike WT proinsulin (Fig. 4B, lane 1), a negligible amount of proinsulin-G(B23)V could be secreted from cells to medium (Fig. 4B, lane 2). However, co-expression of WT Ero1α or Ero1α-Active markedly increased overall proinsulin-G(B23)V secretion (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 5). By contrast, enhanced proinsulin-G(B23)V secretion was only minimally affected by co-expression of the Ero1α-Hex mutant (Fig. 4B, lane 4), although when considered as a fraction of the total (cell + medium) even Ero1α-Hex promoted a small but statistically significant increase in fractional secretion of mutant proinsulin (Fig. 4C). To determine if rescue of mutant proinsulin by Ero1 correlated with increased oxidation of the ER lumen, ER redox state and proinsulin secretion were examined in two cell lines; that is, Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells, with inducible expression of either Ero1α-WT or Ero1α-Active and transiently transfected INS1E cells. For Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells, ER redox poise upon doxycycline-induced expression of Ero1 variants was measured by the HyPerER sensor that directly reacts with H2O2 and can also be oxidized via ER luminal oxidative folding machinery (23.Birk J. Ramming T. Odermatt A. Appenzeller-Herzog C. Green fluorescent protein-based monitoring of endoplasmic reticulum redox poise.Front. Genet. 2013; 4: 108Google Scholar). Induced expression of both Ero1α-WT and Ero1α-Active increased the ER luminal oxidation of the HyPerER reporter; however, the effect for Ero1α-WT did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.058), whereas significance was achieved for Ero1α-Active (Fig. 5A). In parallel with the increased oxidative environment of the ER lumen, mutant hProG(B23)V-CpepMyc secretion was augmented (Fig. 5B). Because transient co-expression of the HyPerER sensor and Ero1α variants is unsuitable for subsequent spectral analysis (23.Birk J. Ramming T. Odermatt A. Appenzeller-Herzog C. Green fluorescent protein-based monitoring of endoplasmic reticulum redox poise.Front.

https://openalex.org/W1976511591,"TCP ECE genes encode transcription factors which have received much attention for their repeated recruitment in the control of floral symmetry in core eudicots, and more recently in monocots. Major duplications of TCP ECE genes have been described in core eudicots, but the evolutionary history of this gene family is unknown in basal eudicots. Reconstructing the phylogeny of ECE genes in basal eudicots will help set a framework for understanding the functional evolution of these genes. TCP ECE genes were sequenced in all major lineages of basal eudicots and Gunnera which belongs to the sister clade to all other core eudicots. We show that in these lineages they have a complex evolutionary history with repeated duplications. We estimate the timing of the two major duplications already identified in the core eudicots within a timeframe before the divergence of Gunnera and after the divergence of Proteales. We also use a synteny-based approach to examine the extent to which the expansion of TCP ECE genes in diverse eudicot lineages may be due to genome-wide duplications. The three major core-eudicot specific clades share a number of collinear genes, and their common evolutionary history may have originated at the γ event. Genomic comparisons in Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum highlight their separate polyploid origin, with syntenic fragments with and without TCP ECE genes showing differential gene loss and genomic rearrangements. Comparison between recently available genomes from two basal eudicots Aquilegia coerulea and Nelumbo nucifera suggests that the two TCP ECE paralogs in these species are also derived from large-scale duplications. TCP ECE loci from basal eudicots share many features with the three main core eudicot loci, and allow us to infer the makeup of the ancestral eudicot locus."
https://openalex.org/W2029678637,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition plays an important role in many patho-physiological processes, including cancer invasion and metastatic progression. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) has been known to be an important factor for both physiological and pathological functions in liver and pancreas. However, its role in EMT and lung cancer progression remains unidentified. We observed that HNF6 level can be down-regulated by TGF-β1 in human lung cancer cells. Knockdown of HNF6 induced EMT and increased cell migration. In contrast, ectopically expression of HNF6 inhibited cell migration and attenuated TGF-β1-induced EMT. The data suggest that HNF6 plays a role in maintaining epithelial phenotype, which suppresses EMT. HNF6 also inhibits both colony formation and proliferation of lung cancer cells. It pronouncedly reduced the formation of tumor xenografts in nude mice. In addition, HNF6 can activate the promoter activity of p53 by directly binding to a specific region of its promoter and therefore increase the protein level of tumor suppressor p53. p53 knockdown induced EMT and increased cell migration, whereas the opposite effect was generated by p53 overexpression. p53 knockdown also inhibited the effect of HNF6 on EMT and cell migration, indicating that p53 is required for the functions of HNF6 herein. Moreover, there is a high positive correlation among the expression levels of HNF6, p53, and E-cadherin in human lung cancer cells and tissues. The data suggest that HNF6 inhibits EMT, cell migration, and invasive growth through a mechanism involving the transcriptional activation of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2003385167,"A screen was recently developed to study the mobilization of starch in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This screen relies on starch synthesis accumulation during nitrogen starvation followed by the supply of nitrogen and the switch to darkness. Hence multiple regulatory networks including those of nutrient starvation, cell cycle control and light to dark transitions are likely to impact the recovery of mutant candidates. In this paper we monitor the specificity of this mutant screen by characterizing the nature of the genes disrupted in the selected mutants. We show that one third of the mutants consisted of strains mutated in genes previously reported to be of paramount importance in starch catabolism such as those encoding β-amylases, the maltose export protein, and branching enzyme I. The other mutants were defective for previously uncharacterized functions some of which are likely to define novel proteins affecting starch mobilization in green algae."
https://openalex.org/W2014954303,"Canonical transient receptor potential 1 (TRPC1) Ca(2+)-permeable cation channels contribute to vascular tone and blood vessel remodeling and represent potential therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disease. Protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] are obligatory for native TRPC1 channel activation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) but how PKC and PI(4,5)P2 act together to induce channel gating remains unresolved. The present study reveals that myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein coordinates activation of TRPC1 channels by PKC and PI(4,5)P2. TRPC1 channels and MARCKS form signaling complexes with PI(4,5)P2 bound to MARCKS; in this configuration TRPC1 channels are closed. Activators of TRPC1 channels induce PKC phosphorylation of TRPC1 proteins, which causes dissociation of TRPC1 subunits from MARCKS and release of PI(4,5)P2 from MARCKS; PI(4,5)P2 subsequently binds to TRPC1 subunits to induce channel opening. Calmodulin acting at, or upstream of, MARCKS is also required for TRPC1 channel opening through a similar gating mechanism involving PKC and PI(4,5)P2. These novel findings show that MARCKS coordinates native TRPC1 channel activation in VSMCs by acting as a reversible PI(4,5)P2 buffer, which is regulated by PKC-mediated TRPC1 phosphorylation. Moreover, our data provide evidence that PI(4,5)P2 is a gating ligand of TRPC1 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2063432567,"At present the ability to create rationally engineered mutant rotaviruses is limited because of the lack of a tractable helper virus-free reverse genetics system. Using the cell culture adapted bovine RV RF strain (G6P6 [1]), we have attempted to recover infectious RV by co-transfecting in vitro transcribed ssRNAs which are identical in sequence to the positive sense strand of each of the 11 dsRNA genomic segments of the RF strain. The RNAs were produced either from cDNAs cloned by a target sequence-independent procedure, or from purified double layered RV particles (DLPs). We have validated their translational function by in vitro synthesis of 35S-labelled proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysates; all 11 proteins encoded by the RV genome were expressed. Transfection experiments with DLP- or cDNA-derived ssRNAs suggested that the RNAs do not act independently as mRNAs for protein synthesis, once delivered into various mammalian cell lines, and exhibit cytotoxicity. Transfected RNAs were not infectious since a viral cytopathic effect was not observed after infection of MA104 cells with lysates from transfected cells. By contrast, an engineered mRNA encoding eGFP was expressed when transfected under identical conditions into the same cell lines. Co-expression of plasmids encoding NSP2 and NSP5 using a fowlpox T7 polymerase recombinant virus revealed viroplasm-like structure formation, but this did not enable the translation of transfected RV ssRNAs. Attempts to recover RV from ssRNAs transcribed intracellularly from transfected cDNAs were also unsuccessful and suggested that these RNAs were also not translated, in contrast to successful translation from a transfected cDNA encoding an eGFP mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2007330424,"Smoking during pregnancy is a risk factor for various adverse birth outcomes. In order to develop effective interventions, insight is needed into the characteristics associated with pregnant women who smoke. Unknown is whether these characteristics differ for women who smoke daily and women who smoke occasionally. Our study sample, drawn from the DELIVER study (Sept 2009-March 2011), consisted of 6107 pregnant women in primary care in the Netherlands who were up to 34 weeks pregnant. The associations of thirteen socio-demographic or lifestyle-related characteristics with ‘any smoking’, ‘daily smoking’ and ‘occasional smoking’ during pregnancy were tested using multiple binary logistic regression with general estimating equations (GEE). Characteristics most strongly associated with any smoking were low education (OR 10.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.0-15.4), being of Turkish ethnicity (OR 3.9; 95%CI 2.3-6.7) and having no partner (OR 3.7; 95%CI 2.3-6.0). Women of Dutch ethnicity were three times more likely to smoke than those from Dutch-speaking Caribbean countries and non-religious women were much more likely to smoke than religious women. Low education was markedly more strongly associated with daily smoking than with occasional smoking (OR 20.3; 95%CI 13.2-31.3 versus OR 6.0; 95%CI 3.4-10.5). Daily smokers were more likely to be associated with other unfavorable lifestyle-related characteristics, such as not taking folic acid, being underweight, and having had an unplanned pregnancy. There is still much potential for health gain with respect to smoking during pregnancy in the Netherlands. Daily and occasional smokers appear to differ in characteristics, and therefore possibly require different interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2088978287,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest protein family and mediate the vast majority of signal transduction processes in the body. Until recently GPCRs were not considered to be voltage dependent. Newly it was shown for several GPCRs that the first step in GPCR activation, the binding of agonist to the receptor, is voltage sensitive: Voltage shifts the receptor between two states that differ in their binding affinity. Here we show that this shift involves the rate constant of dissociation. We used the m2 muscarinic receptor (m2R) a prototypical GPCR and measured directly the dissociation of [3H]ACh from m2R expressed Xenopus oocytes. We show, for the first time, that the voltage dependent change in affinity is implemented by voltage shifting the receptor between two states that differ in their rate constant of dissociation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that suggest that the above shift is achieved by voltage regulating the coupling of the GPCR to its G protein."

We exposed the hand to several horizontal force fields to examine whether external forces influence this percept. In an end-point task subjects reached visually presented positions with their unseen hand. In a vector reproduction task, subjects had to judge a distance and direction visually and reproduce the corresponding vector by moving the unseen hand. We found systematic individual errors in the reproduction of the end-points and vectors, but these errors did not vary systematically with the force fields. This suggests that human proprioception accounts for external forces applied to the hand when sensing the position of the hand in the horizontal plane."
https://openalex.org/W2068565241,"The p53 tumor suppressor gene has a common polymorphism at codon 72 that alters its function. We previously reported that the proline 72 polymorphic variant of p53 (P72) demonstrates increased ability to transactivate a subset of genes, relative to arginine 72 (R72); one of these genes is macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF1). At present, the mechanism(s) underlying the increased transcriptional activity of P72 toward genes like CSF1 have not been completely elucidated. Additionally, the consequences of increased transcription of genes like CSF1 by the P72 variant to the downstream p53 pathway are unknown. In this report, we address these issues. We show that the CSF1 gene contains a conserved binding site for p53, and interestingly that the P72 variant shows increased ability to bind to this site. Moreover, we show that increased CSF1/CSF1R signaling in P72 cells feeds back on the p53 pathway to enhance p53 phosphorylation, levels, and transactivation of target genes, particularly the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A). This leads to an increase in p53-mediated growth arrest, along with a concomitant decrease in apoptosis. Notably, the CSF1/CSF1R signaling axis is overexpressed in several epithelial cancers, and there is clinical evidence that this pathway plays a role in radio-resistance of some cancers. We show that cells expressing CSF1 and CSF1R are indeed radio-resistant, and further, that this effect requires p53. These combined data are the first to implicate the CSF1/CSF1R pathway in the decision between p53-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis. They are also the first to highlight a cytokine as influential in cell fate determined by p53 in epithelial cells. Finally, these data may explain the association of the P72 variant and the CSF1/CSF1R pathway with increased senescence and radio-resistance in some epithelial tumor types."
https://openalex.org/W2112134626,"In recent years, heterologous prime-boost vaccines have been demonstrated to be an effective strategy for generating protective immunity, consisting of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against a variety of pathogens including HIV-1. Previous reports of preclinical and clinical studies have shown the enhanced immunogenicity of viral vector or DNA vaccination followed by heterologous protein boost, compared to using either prime or boost components alone. With such approaches, the selection of an adjuvant for inclusion in the protein boost component is expected to impact the immunogenicity and safety of a vaccine. In this study, we examined in a mouse model the serum cytokine and chemokine profiles for several candidate adjuvants: QS-21, Al(OH)3, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and ISCOMATRIX™ adjuvant, in the context of a previously tested pentavalent HIV-1 Env DNA prime-protein boost formulation, DP6-001. Our data revealed that the candidate adjuvants in the context of the DP6-001 formulation are characterized by unique serum cytokine and chemokine profiles. Such information will provide valuable guidance in the selection of an adjuvant for future AIDS vaccine development, with the ultimate goal of enhancing immunogenicity while minimizing reactogenicity associated with the use of an adjuvant. More significantly, results reported here will add to the knowledge on how to include an adjuvant in the context of a heterologous prime-protein boost vaccination strategy in general."
https://openalex.org/W2154560890,"Subjects characterized as cortisol high responders (HRs) consume more calories after stress, but it is unknown whether cortisol responsiveness predicts a propensity for obesity. Female sheep with either high or low cortisol responses to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) were identified. Body composition was similar in HRs and cortisol low responders (LRs), but the HRs had greater (P<0.01) adiposity than did the LRs (40.5±0.7 vs. 35.8±1.4%) after high-energy feeding, despite comparable food intake. Postprandial thermogenesis in muscle temperature was 0.8 ± 0.08°C higher in the LRs than in the HRs (P<0.01), whereas feeding-induced changes in fat temperature were similar. Leptin and insulin sensitivity were similar in the HRs and LRs. Feeding lowered (P<0.001) the respiratory control ratio in muscle (HRs 9.2±0.8-5.2±1.2; LRs 8.4±0.5-5.2±0.7), indicative of increased uncoupled respiration. Also in muscle, the feeding-induced increases in uncoupling protein (UCP)-3 (fold increase: HRs, 2.4; LRs, 2.0), ryanodine 1 receptor (RyR1; fold increase: HRs 3.1; LRs 2.1), and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase (fold increase: HRs 1.5; LRs 1.6) were equivalent in the HRs and LRs. Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA revealed no haplotypic differences between the 2 groups. We conclude that predisposition to obesity can be predicted by cortisol responsiveness to an ACTH challenge and that the response is due to innate differences in muscle thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1980869434,"Pinellia pedatisecta agglutinin (PPA) has previously been used in labeling fractions of myeloid leukemia cells in our laboratory. We report here that a bacterial expressed recombinant PPA domain b tagged with soluble coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (sCAR-PPAb) preferentially recognized drug resistant cancer cells K562/ADR and H460/5Fu, as compared to their parental cell lines. Pretreatment of K562/ADR cells with sCAR-PPAb significantly enhanced phagocytosis of K562/ADR by macrophages in vivo. Meanwhile, in a K562/ADR xenograft model, intratumoral injection of sCAR-PPAb induced macrophage infiltration and phagocytosis. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and Western blot identified the membrane target of PPA on K562/ADR as sarcolemmal membrane associated protein (SLMAP). An antibody against SLMAP significantly promoted the phagocytosis of K562/ADR by macrophages in vitro. These findings suggest that PPA not only could be developed into a novel agent that can detect drug resistant cancer cells and predict chemotherapy outcome, but also it has potential value in immunotherapy against drug resistant cancer cells through inducing the tumoricidal activity of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2165376978,"Objective The first aim of this study was to assess 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in women with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) during pregnancy, post-delivery and also foetal (cord blood) 25OHD concentrations and to examine relationships between these. The second aim of the study was to investigate potential interactions between maternal body mass index (BMI) and foetal vitamin D status. A further study aim was to examine potential relationships between maternal 25OHD and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) throughout pregnancy. Research Design and Methods This was an observational study of 52 pregnant controls without diabetes and 65 pregnant women with T1DM in a university teaching hospital. Maternal serum 25OHD was measured serially throughout the pregnancy and post-delivery. Cord blood 25OHD was measured at delivery. 25OHD was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results Vitamin D deficiency (25OHD <25 nmol/L) was apparent in both the T1DM subjects and controls at all 3 pregnancy trimesters. Vitamin D levels in all cord blood were <50 nmol/L. Maternal 25OHD correlated positively with cord 25OHD at all 3 trimesters in the T1DM group (p = 0.02; p<0.001; p<0.001). 25OHD levels within cord blood were significantly lower for women with diabetes classified as obese vs. normal weight at booking [normal weight BMI <25 kg/m2 vs. obese BMI >30 kg/m2 (nmol/L±SD); 19.93±11.15 vs. 13.73±4.74, p = 0.026]. In the T1DM group, HbA1c at booking was significantly negatively correlated with maternal 25OHD at all 3 trimesters (p = 0.004; p = 0.001; p = 0.05). Conclusion In T1DM pregnancy, low vitamin D levels persist throughout gestation and post-delivery. Cord blood vitamin D levels correlate with those of the mother, and are significantly lower in obese women than in their normal weight counterparts. Maternal vitamin D levels exhibit a significant negative relationship with HbA1c levels, supporting a potential role for this vitamin in maintaining glycaemic control."
https://openalex.org/W2017075655,"The transcription factors cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) regulate gene transcription in response to elevated cAMP levels. The Crem isoform inducible cAMP early repressor (Icer) is transcribed by the internal promoter P2 as a critical regulator of multiple cellular processes. Here, we describe a novel inducible Crem isoform, small Icer (smIcer), regulated by a newly identified promoter (P6). ChIP revealed binding of CREB to P6 in human and mouse myocardium. P6 activity was induced by constitutively active CREB or stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. In mice, smIcer mRNA was ubiquitously expressed and transiently induced by β-adrenoceptor stimulation e.g., in heart and lung. SmICER repressed both basal and cAMP-induced activities of P6 and P2 promoters. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase induced P2 and P6 in cell type-specific manner. Alternative translational start sites resulted in three different smICER proteins, linked to increased apoptosis sensitivity. In conclusion, the Crem gene provides two distinct and mutually controlled mechanisms of a cAMP-dependent induction of transcriptional repressors. Our results suggest not only that smICER is a novel regulator of cAMP-mediated gene regulation, but also emphasize that biological effects that have been ascribed solely to ICER, should be revised with regard to smICER."
https://openalex.org/W2069031681,"In this study, we investigated the distribution, localization and several various functions of TrkC receptors during development of the Monodelphisopossum brain. Western blotting analysis showed that two different forms of the TrkC receptor, the full-length receptor and one of its truncated forms, are abundantly expressed in the opossum brain. The expression of TrkC receptors was barely detected in the brain of newborn opossums. At postnatal day (P) 3, the expression of full-length TrkC remained at low levels, while moderate expression of the TrkC truncated form was detected. The expression levels of both forms of this protein gradually increased throughout development, peaking at P35. We found that in different neocortical areas located both at the rostral and caudal regions of the cortex, up to 98% of BrdU-labeled cells forming cortical layers (II-VI) had prominently expressed TrkC. To assess which developmental processes of cortical cells are regulated by TrkC receptors, three different shRNAs were constructed. The shRNAs were individually tested in transfected cortical progenitor cells grown on culture plates for 2 days. The effects of the shRNA-TrkC constructs were similar: blockade of TrkC receptors decreased the number of Ki67-positive and apoptotic cells, and it did not change the number of TUJ-positive neurons in vitro. Thus, the lack of TrkC receptors in cultured progenitor cells provided insight on the potential role of these receptors in the regulation of proliferation and cell survival but not in the differentiation of cortical cells."
https://openalex.org/W1981499649,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is an excellent molecular marker for the studies of evolutionary ecology and conservation genetics because it is a family of highly polymorphic genes that play a key role in vertebrate immune response. In this study, the functional genes of MHC Class II B (DAB) were isolated for the first time in a vulnerable species, the Chinese egret (Egrettaeulophotes). Using a full length DNA and cDNA produced by PCR and RACE methods, four potential MHC DAB loci were characterized in the genome of this egret and all four were expressed in liver and blood. At least four copies of the MHC gene complex were similar to two copies of the minimal essential MHC complex of chicken, but are less complex than the multiple copies expressed in passerine species. In MHC polymorphism, 19 alleles of exon 2 were isolated from 48 individuals using PCR. No stop codons or frameshift mutations were found in any of the coding regions. The signatures of positive selection detected in potential peptide-binding regions by Bayesian analysis, suggesting that all of these genes were functional. These data will provide the fundamental basis for further studies to elucidate the mechanisms and significance of MHC molecular adaptation in vulnerable Chinese egret and other ardeids."
https://openalex.org/W2112180589,"Spatial memory is thought to be organized along experienced views and allocentric reference axes. Memory access from different perspectives typically yields V-patterns for egocentric encoding (monotonic decline in performance along with the angular deviation from the experienced perspectives) and W-patterns for axes encoding (better performance along parallel and orthogonal perspectives than along oblique perspectives). We showed that learning an object array with a verbal secondary task reduced W-patterns compared with learning without verbal shadowing. This suggests that axes encoding happened in a verbal format; for example, by rows and columns. Alternatively, general cognitive load from the secondary task prevented memorizing relative to a spatial axis. Independent of encoding, pointing with a surrounding room visible yielded stronger W-patterns compared with pointing with no room visible. This suggests that the visible room geometry interfered with the memorized room geometry. With verbal shadowing and without visual interference only V-patterns remained; otherwise, V- and W-patterns were combined. Verbal encoding and visual interference explain when W-patterns can be expected alongside V-patterns and thus can help in resolving different performance patterns in a wide range of experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2030554076,"The rate-limiting step(s) of translation in the nervous system have not been clearly identified. We have been examining this question in the cell body of the Aplysia sensory neuron, where translational regulation is important for the regulation of synaptic strength. In the present study, we examined the role of the adaptor protein eIF4G. We cloned Aplysia eIF4G (Ap4G) and Ap4G contains all the standard metazoan eIF4G protein-protein interaction domains. Overexpressing Ap4G in Aplysia sensory neurons caused an increase in both cap-dependent and internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation using a previously characterized bicistronic fluorescent reporter. Unexpectedly, measurement of overall translation using the methionine analog, L-azidohomoalanine, revealed that overexpression of Ap4G did not lead to an increase in overall translation rates. Indeed, the effect of Ap4G on the bicistronic reporter depended on the presence of an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5' UTR encoded by the vector. We have previously shown that Mnk strongly decreased cap-dependent translation and this depended on a putative 4G binding domain. Here we extend these results showing that even in the absence of the uORF, overexpression of Mnk strongly decreases cap-dependent translation and this depends on the Mnk binding site in eIF4G. Similarly, an increase in cap-dependent translation seen with overexpression of elongation factor 2 kinase did not depend on the uORF. Overall, we show that eIF4G is rate limiting for translation of an mRNA encoding an uORF, but is not generally a rate-limiting step for translation."

The indications of such medicines are determined by proving, i.e. by applying the remedies in healthy subjects. However, there are several complex homeopathic medicinal products on the market with approved therapeutic indications. The efficacy of these medicines has been assessed in clinical trials on patients. There is no upper limit of dosing for such homeopathic remedies, and these products often contain undiluted mother tincture. The aim of our study was to compare an allopathic herbal medicine and a homeopathic product containing undiluted mother tincture based on the same plant. Two products (an allopathic herbal medicine and a homeopathic product) containing Vitex agnus-castus extract were analyzed by HPLC-DAD for their agnuside and casticin contents. The agnuside content of the allopathic product was approximately four times higher, while the amount of casticin was in the same order of magnitude. Our experiments revealed the presence of active ingredients in allopathic quantity in a homeopathic preparation, highlighting the controversy between the principles of classical and practice of contemporary homeopathy. According to the principles of classical homeopathy these remedies cannot be considered as homeopathic remedies but rather as (allopathic) herbal ones. This phenomenon necessitates a case-by-case approach towards the possible adverse effects and drug interactions of homeopathics in the daily medical practice. Homeopathic products containing active agents in allopathic doses should be treated the same way as allopathic medicines from the point of view of quality assurance and pharmacovigilance."
https://openalex.org/W1986984772,"Background Little is known about the effect of provider continuity prior to the diagnosis of advanced lung cancer and end-of-life care. Methods Retrospective analysis of 69,247 Medicare beneficiaries aged 67 years or older diagnosed with Stage IIIB or IV lung cancer between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 2005 who died within two years of diagnosis. We examined visit patterns to a primary care physician (PCP) and/or any provider one year prior to the diagnosis of advanced lung cancer as measures of continuity of care. Outcome measures were hospitalization, ICU use and chemotherapy use during the last month of life, and hospice use during the last week of life. Results Seeing a PCP or any provider in the year prior to the diagnosis of advanced lung cancer increased the likelihood of hospitalization, ICU care, chemotherapy and hospice use during the end of life. Patients with 1–3, 4–7 or >7 visits to their PCP in the year prior to the diagnosis of lung cancer had 1.0 (reference), 1.08 (95% CI; 1.04–1.13), and 1.14 (95% CI; 1.08–1.19) odds of hospitalization during the last month of life, respectively. Odds of hospice use during the last week of life were higher in patients with visits to multiple PCPs (OR 1.10: 95% CI; 1.06–1.15) compared to those whose visits were all to the same PCP. Conclusion Provider continuity in the year prior to the diagnosis of advanced lung cancer was not associated with lower use of aggressive care during end of life. Our study did not have information on patient preferences and result should be interpreted accordingly."

https://openalex.org/W1992111809,"Vps74p is a member of the PtdIns(4)P-binding protein family. Vps74p interacts with Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases and the coat protein COPI complex to modulate Golgi retention of glycosyltransferases and with the PtdIns(4)P phosphatase Sac1p to modulate PtdIns(4)P homeostasis at the Golgi. Genetic analysis has shown that Vps74p is required for the formation of abnormal elongated buds in cdc34-2 cells. The C-terminal region of Vps74p is required for Vps74p multimerization, Golgi localization, and glycosyltransferase interactions; however, the functional significance of the N-terminal region and three putative phosphorylation sites of Vps74p have not been well characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that Vps74p executes multiple cellular functions using different domains. We found that the N-terminal 66 amino acids of Vps74p are dispensable for its Golgi localization and modulation of cell wall integrity but are required for glycosyltransferase retention and glycoprotein processing. Deletion of the N-terminal 90 amino acids, but not the 66 amino acids, of Vps74p impaired its ability to restore the elongated bud phenotype in cdc34-2/vps74Δ cells. Deletion of Sac1p and Arf1p also specifically reduced the abnormal elongated bud phenotype in cdc34-2 cells. Furthermore, we found that three N-terminal phosphorylation sites contribute to rapamycin hypersensitivity, although these phosphorylation residues are not involved in Vps74p localization, ability to modulate glycosyltransferase retention, or elongated bud formation in cdc34-2 cells. Thus, we propose that Vps74p may use different domains to interact with specific effectors thereby differentially modulating a variety of cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1996221131,"Blood vessel-specific fluorescent transgenic mice are excellent tools to study the development of the vasculature and angiogenic processes. There is growing interest in the biological processes relevant to endothelial cells but limited tools exist to selectively evaluate subcellular functions of this cell type in vivo. Here, we report a novel transgenic animal model that expresses mitochondrially targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) via the Hb9 promoter, a homeobox transcription factor with limited known involvement in the vasculature. Random integration of the transgene, containing the entire mouse Hb9 promoter, was found to be expressed in a variety of vascularised tissues. Further inspection revealed that Mito-EGFP localizes to the endothelial cells (ECs) of a subset of microvascular blood vessels, especially in the central nervous system (CNS), heart, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and skin. We demonstrate the utility of this novel transgenic mouse, named Endo-MitoEGFP, in the detection, imaging, and isolation of microvascular ECs and evaluation of EC mitochondrial function isolated from adult animals. These transgenic mice will be useful to studies of ECs in development, physiology, and pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2000757120,"Defects in miRNA biogenesis or activity are associated to development abnormalities and diseases. In Drosophila, miRNAs are predominantly loaded in Argonaute-1, which they guide for silencing of target RNAs. The miRNA pathway overlaps the RNAi pathway in this organism, as miRNAs may also associate with Argonaute-2, the mediator of RNAi. We set up a gene construct in which a single inducible promoter directs the expression of the GFP protein as well as two miRNAs perfectly matching the GFP sequences. We show that self-silencing of the resulting automiG gene requires Drosha, Pasha, Dicer-1, Dicer-2 and Argonaute-2 loaded with the anti-GFP miRNAs. In contrast, self-silencing of the automiG gene does not involve Argonaute-1. Thus, automiG reports in vivo for both miRNA biogenesis and Ago-2 mediated silencing, providing a powerful biosensor to identify situations where miRNA or siRNA pathways are impaired. As a proof of concept, we used automiG as a biosensor to screen a chemical library and identified 29 molecules that strongly inhibit miRNA silencing, out of which 5 also inhibit RNAi triggered by long double-stranded RNA. Finally, the automiG sensor is also self-silenced by the anti-GFP miRNAs in HeLa cells and might be easily used to identify factors involved in miRNA biogenesis and silencing guided by perfect target complementarity in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2005096459,"The major dilemma of cancer chemotherapy has always been a double-edged sword, producing resistance in tumor cells and life-threatening destruction of nontumorigenic tissue. Glioblastoma is the most common form of primary brain tumor, with median survival at 14 months after surgery, radiation and temozolomide (monofunctional alkylator) therapy. Treatment failure is most often due to temozolomide-resistant tumor growth. The underlying basis for development of tumor cell resistance to temozolomide instead of death is not understood. Our current results demonstrate that both cervical carcinoma (HeLa MR) and glioblastoma (U251) tumor cells exposed to an equivalent chemotherapeutic concentration of a monofunctional alkylator undergo multiple cell cycles, maintenance of metabolic activity, and a prolonged time to death that involves accumulation of Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) within the nucleus. A minority of the tumor cell population undergoes senescence, with minimal caspase cleavage. Surviving tumor cells are comprised of a very small subpopulation of individual cells that eventually resume proliferation, out of which resistant cells emerge. In contrast, normal human cells (MCF12A) exposed to a monofunctional alkylator undergo an immediate decrease in metabolic activity and subsequent senescence. A minority of the normal cell population undergoes cell death by the caspase cleavage pathway. All cytotoxic events occur within the first cell cycle in nontumorigenic cells. In summation, we have demonstrated that two different highly malignant tumor cell lines slowly undergo very altered cellular and temporal responses to chemotherapeutic monofunctional alkylation, as compared to rapid responses of normal cells. In the clinic, this produces resistance and growth of tumor cells, cytotoxicity of normal cells, and death of the patient."
https://openalex.org/W2070837537,"The human retinoblastoma gene (RB1) is imprinted; the mouse Rb1 gene is not. Imprinted expression of RB1 is due to differential methylation of a CpG island (CpG85), which is located in the pseudogene PPP1R26P1 in intron 2 of RB1. CpG85 serves as promoter for an alternative RB1 transcript, which is expressed from the unmethylated paternal allele only and is thought to suppress expression of the full-length RB1 transcript in cis. PPP1R26P1 contains another CpG island (CpG42), which is biallelically methylated. To determine the influence of PPP1R26P1 on RB1 expression, we generated an in vitro murine embryonic stem cell model by introducing human PPP1R26P1 into mouse Rb1. Next generation bisulfite sequencing of CpG85 and CpG42 revealed differences in their susceptibility to DNA methylation, gaining methylation at a median level of 4% and 18%, respectively. We showed binding of RNA polymerase II at and transcription from the unmethylated CpG85 in PPP1R26P1 and observed reduced expression of full-length Rb1 from the targeted allele. Our results identify human PPP1R26P1 as a cis-repressive element and support a connection between retrotransposition of PPP1R26P1 into human RB1 and the reduced expression of RB1 on the paternal allele."

Polarized alveolar epithelial cells isolated from rat lungs were cultured on permeant filters and their electrophysiological properties recorded. A 20% bilateral hypotonic shock induced an immediate, but transient 52% rise in total transepithelial current and a 67% increase in the amiloride-sensitive current mediated by ENaC. Amiloride pre-treatment decreased the current rise after hypotonic shock, showing that ENaC current is involved in this response. Since Cl(-) transport is modulated by hypotonic shock, its contribution to the basal and hypotonic-induced transepithelial current was also assessed. Apical NPPB, a broad Cl(-) channel inhibitor and basolateral DIOA a potassium chloride co-transporter (KCC) inhibitor reduced the total and ENaC currents, showing that transcellular Cl(-) transport plays a major role in that process. During hypotonic shock, a basolateral Cl(-) influx, partly inhibited by NPPB is essential for the hypotonic-induced current rise. Hypotonic shock promoted apical ATP secretion and increased intracellular Ca(2+). While apyrase, an ATP scavenger, did not inhibit the hypotonic shock current response, W7 a calmodulin antagonist completely prevented the hypotonic current rise. These results indicate that a basolateral Cl(-) influx as well as Ca(2+)/calmodulin, but not ATP, are involved in the acute transepithelial current rise elicited by hypotonic shock."

Our previous results showed that the p23 is indispensable for host-specific replication and is localized in the nucleus with a novel nuclear localization signal. To investigate additional function(s) of p23, mutations of basic amino acids lysine (K), arginine (R) and histidine (H) that abolish its nuclear localization, were introduced into a biologically active full-length cDNA clone p223 of HCRSV for testing its effects on virus replication and virus movement in vivo. Primer-specific reverse transcription-PCR was conducted to detect gene transcript level of p23 and viral coat protein separately. Virus replication and its coat protein expression were detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization and Western blot, respectively. The effect of p23 was further confirmed by using artificial microRNA inoculation-mediated silencing. Results showed that the two mutants were able to replicate in protoplasts but unable to move from inoculated leaves to newly emerged leaves. Both the p23 and the CP genes of HCRSV were detected in the newly emerged leaves of infected plants but CP was not detected by Western blot and no symptom was observed on those leaves at 19 days post inoculation. This study demonstrates that when p23 is prevented from entering the nucleus, it results in restriction of virus long distance movement which in turn abrogates symptom expression in the newly emerged leaves. We conclude that the p23 protein of HCRSV is required for virus long distance movement."
https://openalex.org/W2092355806,"Readout-segmented echo planar imaging with 2D navigator-based reacquisition is an uprising technique enabling the sampling of high-resolution diffusion images with reduced susceptibility artifacts. However, low signal from the small voxels and long scan times hamper the clinical applicability. Therefore, we introduce a regularization algorithm based on total variation that is applied directly on the entire diffusion tensor. The spatially varying regularization parameter is determined automatically dependent on spatial variations in signal-to-noise ratio thus, avoiding over- or under-regularization. Information about the noise distribution in the diffusion tensor is extracted from the diffusion weighted images by means of complex independent component analysis. Moreover, the combination of those features enables processing of the diffusion data absolutely user independent. Tractography from in vivo data and from a software phantom demonstrate the advantage of the spatially varying regularization compared to un-regularized data with respect to parameters relevant for fiber-tracking such as Mean Fiber Length, Track Count, Volume and Voxel Count. Specifically, for in vivo data findings suggest that tractography results from the regularized diffusion tensor based on one measurement (16 min) generates results comparable to the un-regularized data with three averages (48 min). This significant reduction in scan time renders high resolution (1×1×2.5 mm3) diffusion tensor imaging of the entire brain applicable in a clinical context."
