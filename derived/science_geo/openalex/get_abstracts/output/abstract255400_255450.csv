Although the identity of the ubiquitinated protein specific to either disorder was unknown, we showed that TDP-43 is the major disease protein in both disorders. Pathologic TDP-43 was hyper-phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and cleaved to generate C-terminal fragments and was recovered only from affected central nervous system regions, including hippocampus, neocortex, and spinal cord. TDP-43 represents the common pathologic substrate linking these neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2050042714,"A common single-nucleotide polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, a methionine (Met) substitution for valine (Val) at codon 66 (Val66Met), is associated with alterations in brain anatomy and memory, but its relevance to clinical disorders is unclear. We generated a variant BDNF mouse (BDNF Met/Met ) that reproduces the phenotypic hallmarks in humans with the variant allele. BDNF Met was expressed in brain at normal levels, but its secretion from neurons was defective. When placed in stressful settings, BDNF Met/Met mice exhibited increased anxiety-related behaviors that were not normalized by the antidepressant, fluoxetine. A variant BDNF may thus play a key role in genetic predispositions to anxiety and depressive disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2107641573,"Quantum teleportation is an important ingredient in distributed quantum networks, and can also serve as an elementary operation in quantum computers. Teleportation was first demonstrated as a transfer of a quantum state of light onto another light beam; later developments used optical relays and demonstrated entanglement swapping for continuous variables. The teleportation of a quantum state between two single material particles (trapped ions) has now also been achieved. Here we demonstrate teleportation between objects of a different nature - light and matter, which respectively represent 'flying' and 'stationary' media. A quantum state encoded in a light pulse is teleported onto a macroscopic object (an atomic ensemble containing 10^12 caesium atoms). Deterministic teleportation is achieved for sets of coherent states with mean photon number (n) up to a few hundred. The fidelities are 0.58+-0.02 for n=20 and 0.60+-0.02 for n=5 - higher than any classical state transfer can possibly achieve. Besides being of fundamental interest, teleportation using a macroscopic atomic ensemble is relevant for the practical implementation of a quantum repeater. An important factor for the implementation of quantum networks is the teleportation distance between transmitter and receiver; this is 0.5 metres in the present experiment. As our experiment uses propagating light to achieve the entanglement of light and atoms required for teleportation, the present approach should be scalable to longer distances."

To address this issue directly, we exposed cohorts of CWD-naiÌve deer to saliva, blood, or urine and feces from CWD-positive deer. We found infectious prions capable of transmitting CWD in saliva (by the oral route) and in blood (by transfusion). The results help to explain the facile transmission of CWD among cervids and prompt caution concerning contact with body fluids in prion infections."

https://openalex.org/W2028230396,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is implicated in synaptic plasticity and local translation in dendrites. We found that the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, increased the Kv1.1 voltage-gated potassium channel protein in hippocampal neurons and promoted Kv1.1 surface expression on dendrites without altering its axonal expression. Moreover, endogenous Kv1.1 mRNA was detected in dendrites. Using Kv1.1 fused to the photoconvertible fluorescence protein Kaede as a reporter for local synthesis, we observed Kv1.1 synthesis in dendrites upon inhibition of mTOR or the N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor. Thus, synaptic excitation may cause local suppression of dendritic Kv1 channels by reducing their local synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2092987197,"Regulatory T cells (Treg) express Foxp3, a forkhead family member that is necessary and sufficient for Treg lineage choice and function. Ectopic expression of Foxp3 in non-Treg leads to repression of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon γ (IFNγ) genes, gain of suppressor function, and induction of genes such as CD25, GITR, and CTLA-4, but the mode by which Foxp3 enforces this program is unclear. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have demonstrated that Foxp3 binds to the endogenous IL-2 and IFNγ loci in T cells, but only after T cell receptor stimulation. This activation-induced Foxp3 binding was abrogated by cyclosporin A, suggesting a role for the phosphatase calcineurin in Foxp3 function. We have also shown that binding of Foxp3 to the IL-2 and IFNγ genes induces active deacetylation of histone H3, a process that inhibits chromatin remodeling and opposes gene transcription. Conversely, binding of Foxp3 to the GITR, CD25, and CTLA-4 genes results in increased histone acetylation. These data indicate that Foxp3 may regulate transcription through direct chromatin remodeling and show that Foxp3 function is influenced by signals from the TCR. Regulatory T cells (Treg) express Foxp3, a forkhead family member that is necessary and sufficient for Treg lineage choice and function.

Acquired immune tolerance depends upon a subset of T cells that suppress the differentiation and function of pathogenic effector T cells. These regulatory T cells (Treg) specifically express Foxp3, a member of the forkhead family of DNA-binding proteins that appears to be necessary and sufficient for Treg lineage choice (1Hori S.

Humans with mutations in the foxp3 gene suffer from an X-linked complex of immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, and enteropathy, a syndrome that results in part from the lack of Treg and leads to eventual death of these patients in childhood (4Bennett C.L. Christie J. Ramsdell F. Brunkow M.E. Ferguson P.J. Whitesell L. Kelly T.E. Saulsbury F.T. Chance P.F. Ochs H.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 20-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar). Similarly, Treg are crucial for the inhibition of immunopathology in experimental models of organ transplantation and early onset autoimmune disorders and have been implicated in the control of childhood (type 1) autoimmune diabetes mellitus (5Wood K.J.

These data suggest that Foxp3, like Foxp1 and Foxp2 (10Shu W. Yang H. Zhang L. Lu M.M. Morrisey E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27488-27497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), can function as a transcriptional repressor. However, expression of Foxp3 also leads to the induction of multiple genes, but the molecular basis for this activity is not known. It is also clear that Foxp3 expression alone is not sufficient for regulatory activity, as Foxp3+ Treg must receive antigenic signaling to exert suppressor function (11Sakaguchi S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar), but the basis for this activation requirement is not clear. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to analyze binding and remodeling of the chromatin at several Foxp3-responsive genes. Our studies provide important insight into how Foxp3 may regulate anergy in Treg and suggest a potential explanation for why Treg require T cell receptor (TCR) activation for their suppressive functions. Cells—A Jurkat human T cell line expressing the ecotropic retroviral receptor (mCAT-1) (12Zhu M. Janssen E. Zhang W. J.

Treg were also induced in vitro by culturing CD4+CD25- for 3-4 days on plate-bound anti-CD3 in the presence of soluble anti-CD28 (0.5 μg/ml each) and TGFβ (5 ng/ml). Retroviral Transduction—Murine Foxp3 cDNA was amplified from C57BL/6 thymus and cloned into the murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based MIGR1 and MINR1 retroviral vectors (13Pear W.S. Nolan G.P.

For generation of retrovirus, constructs were cotransfected with the pCLeco (Invitrogen) helper plasmid into the 293T-based Phoenix ecotropic packaging cell line (provided by G. Nolan, Stanford University). CD4+CD25- T cells were activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (3 ng/ml), ionomycin (1 μm), and IL-2 (10 units/ml) for 24 h, washed, and transduced by spinfection (13Pear W.S. Nolan G.P.

Transduced cells were expanded in IL-2 for 1-3 days. The mCAT-1 Jurkat line was transduced as above with no activation. The MIGR1-transduced Jurkat cells depicted in Figs. 2, 3, 4 were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and maintained as stable lines. The transduced CD4+ T cells depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 were enriched to 92-97% purity before analysis using anti-NGFR-coupled magnetic beads. In the experiments depicted in Figs. 3, 4, 5, CD4+ T cell transduction efficiencies were >80%.FIGURE 3Analysis of Foxp3 binding to the endogenous IL-2 and IFNγ loci by ChIP analysis.

Murine CD4+ T cells were transduced with MIGR1 empty vector (light gray bars) or MIGR1-FLAG-Foxp3 (dark gray bars) and were allowed to rest for 24 h in medium. Chromatin extracts were precipitated with Ab against Foxp3 (A-C) or AcH3 (D-F), and DNA was probed for the promoter regions of the GITR (-227 to -19), CD25 (-98 to +75), and CTLA-4 (-177 to -22) genes by qRT-PCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) qRT-PCR, Immunoblot, and Immunocytochemical Analysis— Total RNA was extracted from 1-2 × 106 cells and amplified using primer/probe sets (Applied Biosystems) against GITR, CTLA-4, TGFβ, IL-2, and 18 S RNA. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared in Laemmli buffer, and cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using a commercial kit (Pierce). For immunoblot analysis, extracts of 0.5-1 × 106 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, blocked, and probed with Ab against the FLAG epitope (Sigma), native Foxp3 (catalogue numbers 14-5773 and 14-7979; eBioscience), Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or actin (Sigma). For immunocytochemistry, cytospun cells were fixed in periodatelysine-paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using Triton X-100 (0.1%); Foxp3 was localized by overnight incubation with anti-Foxp3 monoclonal antibody (catalogue number 14-5773; eBioscience) followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgG and developed using an Envision immunoperoxidase kit (Dako). In Vitro Suppression Assay—Purified CD4+CD25+ Treg or transduced CD4+ T cells were added at the indicated ratios (Treg:target) to a 1:3 mixture of naïve, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester-labeled CD4+CD25- target T cells and T cell-depleted, irradiated splenocytes.

Control precipitations using nonspecific antibody were also performed from the same chromatin extracts to establish the nonspecific background. Genomic DNA extracted from each precipitate was probed by qRT-PCR for the regulatory regions of the IL-2 (14Thomas R.M. Gao L. Wells A.D. J.

Ectopic Expression and Function of Foxp3 in CD4+ T Cells— To study the basis of gene regulation by Foxp3, we utilized an ectopic model in which Foxp3 is expressed via retroviral transduction in primary, non-regulatory lineage CD4+ T cells (1Hori S. Nomura T. Sakaguchi S. Science. 2003; 299: 1057-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Murine stem cell virus-based retroviral constructs (13Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) carrying green fluorescent protein (Fig. 1B) or mutant human nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) (Fig. 1C) reporters were used to express wild-type murine Foxp3 or an N-terminal FLAG-tagged version of Foxp3 in primary CD4+CD25- T cells. Foxp3-transduced CD4+ T cells, but not control empty vector-transduced cells, exhibit specific expression of both Foxp3 mRNA (Fig. 1D) and protein (Fig. 1E) at levels roughly 2-fold higher than natural CD4+CD25+ Treg. Natural CD25+ Treg constitutively express GITR, CTLA-4, and TGFβ (Ref. 11Sakaguchi S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar and Fig. 2, A-C, left panels), and consistent with previous studies (1Hori S. Nomura T. Sakaguchi S.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) we found that ectopic expression of Foxp3 in CD4+ T cells recapitulates this genetic program (Fig. 2, A-C, right panels). We also found that, like natural CD25+ Treg, Foxp3-transduced CD4+ T cells could suppress the proliferation of naïve CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2D). This gain of function was Foxp3 specific, as empty vector-transduced CD4+ T cells could not suppress in the same assay (Fig. 2D). We also confirmed that, like natural CD25+ Treg (Fig. 2E), Foxp3-transduced T cells were defective in activation-induced IL-2 gene expression at the level of both mRNA and protein (Fig. 2, F and G). This defect in IL-2 production was observed with both wild-type and FLAG-tagged Foxp3 constructs (data not shown). The Foxp3-transduced T cells also failed to produce IFNγ in response to TCR ligation (Fig. 2H). These data validate this ectopic expression system as a functionally relevant model in which to study Foxp3 transcriptional biology. Foxp3 Binds to the Endogenous IL-2 and IFNγ Loci in T Cells in a TCR-dependent Manner—We identified six forkhead transcription factor consensus elements in the region 1 kb upstream of the murine IL-2 locus (Fig. 3A) and five elements in the defined promoter and enhancer regions of the IFNγ locus (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Foxp3 may bind to the regulatory region of these genes and act as a direct transcriptional repressor. One of these sites in the IL-2 promoter/enhancer, which contains putative binding elements on both DNA strands, is located adjacent to the ARRE-2 NFAT/AP-1/Oct-1 response element at -263 bp (Fig. 3A, asterisk) and has been shown to bind several forkhead family members (9Wu Y. Borde M. Heissmeyer V. Feuerer M. Lapan A.D. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. Guo L. Han A. Ziegler S.F. Mathis D. Benoist C. Chen L. Rao A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7736-7745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To determine whether Foxp3 binds to the endogenous IL-2 and IFNγ genes, we employed chromatin ChIP analysis. We were able to detect in vivo binding of Foxp3 to the endogenous IL-2 promoter (Fig. 3C) and the endogenous IFNγ intronic enhancer (Fig. 3D) in murine CD4+ T cells transduced with FLAG-tagged Foxp3, but not with empty vector, using antibodies specific for either FLAG or Foxp3. Similarly, Foxp3-transduced Jurkat T cells showed specific binding of Foxp3 to the proximal and distal regions upstream of the IL-2 gene (Fig. 3, E and F) as well as to the IFNγ promoter (Fig. 3G). We were also able to detect binding of native Foxp3 protein to the endogenous IL-2 promoter in Foxp3+ Treg induced in vitro by TGFβ, but not in Foxp3- CD4+ T cells (supplemental Fig. S1). These results demonstrate that Foxp3 promoter occupancy is a physiologic phenomenon in natural Treg and not merely an artifact of ectopic expression. Interestingly, Foxp3 binding to the regulatory elements of these cytokine genes was highly dependent upon active TCR/CD28 stimulation. Foxp3-transduced CD4+ T cells that were allowed to come to rest after activation exhibited little or no Foxp3 promoter occupancy at the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 3H), the IFNγ promoter (Fig. 3I), or the IFNγ intronic enhancer (Fig. 3J), whereas restimulation of Foxp3-transduced T cells through the TCR and CD28 restored strong, specific Foxp3 binding at all these regions (Fig. 3, H-J). This activation-induced Foxp3 binding could be simulated by the combination of diacylglycerol analog and Ca2+ ionophore (Fig. 3K), implicating protein kinase C, RasGRP, and/or Ca2+ signaling in promoting Foxp3 chromatin binding. Consistent with this interpretation, inhibition of Ca2+-dependent calcineurin phosphatase activity during T cell activation using cyclosporine A (CsA) abrogated Foxp3 binding to the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 3L) and the IFNγ enhancer (Fig. 3M). These data demonstrate that TCR-coupled Ca2+ signaling through calcineurin is required for Foxp3 binding to chromatin at the IL-2 and IFNγ genes and provides a molecular framework for why Treg suppressor function requires activation and is CsA sensitive (11Sakaguchi S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar). TCR Signaling Influences the Subcellular Localization of Foxp3—The data in Fig. 3 show that Foxp3 promoter occupancy at inflammatory cytokine genes is dependent upon signals from the antigen receptor and suggest that Foxp3 function may be modulated post-translationally by TCR signaling. Consistent with this, we found that activation through TCR/CD28 induces a shift in the subcellular localization of Foxp3 from a primarily cytoplasmic/perinuclear pattern in most cells to a dense nuclear pattern in both natural CD4+CD25+ Treg and Foxp3-transduced CD4+ T cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A-D). This was confirmed biochemically in Foxp3-transduced Jurkat T cells in which the ratio of Foxp3 present in nuclear versus cytoplasmic extracts was increased after TCR ligation (supplemental Fig. S2E). This shift in the subcellular localization of Foxp3 was not significantly affected by CsA (data not shown), suggesting that the requirement for TCR signals for Foxp3 promoter occupancy is not at the level of nuclear localization and implying that other TCR-coupled signaling pathways must be involved in regulating the subcellular distribution of this protein. Foxp3 Induces Histone Deacetylation at the IL-2 and IFNγ Loci—Transcriptional regulators commonly function by modulating the local chromatin structure at gene promoters and enhancers. An initial step in the relaxation of chromatin structure is the enzymatic addition of acetyl groups to the positively charged tails of histone H3 and H4 by histone acetyltransferases (20Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation often accompanies gene transcription (21Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), is required for the appropriate tissue-specific and context-dependent induction of many genes (22Agalioti T. Lomvardas S.

Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To determine whether Foxp3 might regulate IL-2 and IFNγ gene expression through chromatin remodeling, we measured histone acetylation (AcH3) at the IL-2 and IFNγ loci in activated, Foxp3-expressing T cells. The chromatin at the IL-2 and IFNγ promoters in quiescent, naïve CD4+ T cells exists in a “closed” state (14Thomas R.M. Gao L. Wells A.D. J.

Following productive T cell activation, histones at the IL-2 and IFNγ loci are rapidly and stably acetylated (Ref. 14Thomas R.M. Gao L. Wells A.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and Fig. 4, A-C), and the chromatin at the IL-2 promoter is remodeled to form an accessible structure (14Thomas R.M. Gao L. Wells A.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Ward S.B. Hernandez-Hoyos G. Chen F. Waterman M. Reeves R. Rothenberg E.V.

A significant amount of AcH3 remained at the IL-2 promoter after these activated cells were allowed to come to rest following MIGR1 transduction (Fig. 4B, light gray bars). However, transduction with MIGR1-Foxp3 blocked activation-induced AcH3 at the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 4B, dark gray bars), and secondary recruitment of Foxp3 to the IL-2 promoter following restimulation resulted in a further 30-fold decrease in AcH3 to undetectable levels (Fig. 4B, dark gray bars). Foxp3 also induced activation-dependent histone deacetylation at the IFNγ enhancer in transduced CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4C, dark gray bars). Jurkat T cells transduced with empty MIGR1 vector likewise exhibited activation-induced AcH3 upstream of the IL-2 and IFNγ genes (Fig. 4, D-F, light gray bars). However, expression of Foxp3 in these cells resulted in marked histone deacetylation at these same regions (Fig. 4, D-F, dark gray bars). Together, these data show that Foxp3 binding to the IL-2 and IFNγ loci in T cells induces local histone deacetylation and suggest that the transcriptional effects of Foxp3 may function through recruitment of histone deacetylases and modulation of chromatin structure. Foxp3 Increases Histone Acetylation at the GITR, CD25, and CTLA-4 Loci—Our data above show that Foxp3 directly binds to the IL-2 and IFNγ loci and induces strong deacetylation of the histones in these regions, which is consistent with the behavior of a transcriptional repressor. However, expression of Foxp3 in T cells also leads to the induction of genes such as GITR, CD25, and CTLA-4. If Foxp3 is only capable of transcriptional repression, then Foxp3 must regulate these genes indirectly by repressing genes that normally negatively regulate GITR, CD25, and CTLA-4 expression. Alternatively, if Foxp3 is capable of functioning as either a repressor or an activator then one may predict that Foxp3 would bind directly to all these genes but regulate chromatin structure differently in the context of the repressed versus the induced loci. To test this, we measured Foxp3 binding and AcH3 at the GITR, CD25, and CTLA-4 promoters in control- and Foxp3-transduced CD4+ T cells. We were able to detect specific binding of Foxp3 to the promoter regions of GITR, CD25, and CTLA-4 (Fig. 5, A-C), suggesting that Foxp3 could potentially regulate these genes directly. Whereas Foxp3 binding to the IL-2 and IFNγ loci led to histone deacetylation, binding of Foxp3 to the GITR, CD25, and CTLA-4 promoters conversely resulted in increased histone acetylation at these regions (Fig. 5, D-F). This modification of the chromatin structure generally facilitates gene transcription and is consistent with Foxp3 serving as a direct activator of CD25, GITR, and CTLA-4 gene expression. Our studies here have demonstrated that Foxp3 binds directly to the promoter and enhancer regions of the endogenous IL-2 and IFNγ genes in T cells. This binding is associated with marked histone deacetylation and repression of gene transcription. Our studies also demonstrated that the binding of Foxp3 to these loci is absolutely dependent upon T cell activation and suggest a scenario in which the TCR-CD28 complex transduces signals that influence Foxp3 function. This regulation could be mediated directly by TCR-mediated post-translational modifications that influence the subcellular distribution or DNA binding affinity of Foxp3. Indeed, several other forkhead transcription factors (e.g. Foxo1-4, Foxm1, Foxa2) are known to be regulated by site-specific phosphorylation (28Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 30Jackson J.G. Kreisberg J.I. Koterba A.P. Yee D. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4574-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the primary structure of Foxp3 suggests that this protein contains multiple motifs that may serve as substrates for TCR-coupled protein kinases. Consistent with this, we find that TCR signaling induces a shift in the subcellular pattern of expression of Foxp3. One of the signals involved in activation-induced Foxp3 promoter occupancy is apparently transduced through the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, as cyclosporine A treatment completely abrogated in situ Foxp3 binding to the IL-2 promoter in our studies. However, CsA did not significantly influence the nuclear localization of Foxp3; therefore, calcineurin must instead influence a more distal step involved in Foxp3 promoter occupancy. This could be due to direct modulation of Foxp3 phosphorylation status in a manner analogous to the regulation of NFAT DNA binding activity by calcineurin (31Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Alternatively, TCR signaling may influence Foxp3 promoter occupancy indirectly by regulating the function of other factors that cooperate with Foxp3 for its function. One protein that has recently been shown to cooperate with Foxp3 is NFAT. This transcription factor is Ca2+/calcineurin dependent, it physically associates with Foxp3 in transfected cell lines (8Bettelli E. Dastrange M. Oukka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5138-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 9Wu Y. Borde M. Heissmeyer V. Feuerer M. Lapan A.D. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. Guo L. Han A. Ziegler S.F. Mathis D. Benoist C. Chen L. Rao A.

Borde M. Heissmeyer V. Feuerer M. Lapan A.D. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. Guo L. Han A. Ziegler S.F. Mathis D. Benoist C. Chen L. Rao A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7736-7745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and amino acid residues in Foxp3 involved in NFAT binding are required for repression of IL-2 promoter-driven transcription (9Wu Y. Borde M. Heissmeyer V. Feuerer M. Lapan A.D. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. Guo L. Han A. Ziegler S.F. Mathis D. Benoist C. Chen L. Rao A. Cell. 2006; 126: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Therefore, cooperativity with NFAT could also explain the requirement for TCR signaling for the in situ binding of Foxp3 to IL-2 promoter observed in our studies. Both of the scenarios above, which are not mutually exclusive, are consistent with our current data and do not exclude roles for other signaling pathways in the regulation of Foxp3 function. Our studies have also demonstrated that Foxp3 influences the chromatin structure at the regulatory regions of Foxp3-responsive genes. For instance, Foxp3 binding to the promoter/enhancer regions of the IL-2 and IFNγ loci, which are repressed by Foxp3, is associated with strong histone deacetylation. This suggests that Foxp3 is able to recruit histone deacetylase enzymes to these genes, which are integral components of all known transcriptional co-repressor complexes (25Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, our preliminary experiments showed that pharmacologic inhibition of cellular histone deacetylase activity can restore histone acetylation at the IL-2 and IFNγ loci in Foxp3-expressing cells. 4C. Chen and A. D. Wells, unpublished observations. Together with previous results showing that Foxp3 can bind to chromatin at the IL-2 promoter in activated Treg (9Wu Y. Borde M. Heissmeyer V. Feuerer M. Lapan A.D. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. Guo L. Han A. Ziegler S.F. Mathis D. Benoist C. Chen L. Rao A. Cell. 2006; 126: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and that the IL-2 promoter fails to undergo nucleosome remodeling in these cells (32Su L. Creusot R.J. Gallo E.M. Chan S.M. Utz P.J. Fathman C.G. Ermann J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4994-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), our data imply that Foxp3 acts as a direct transcriptional repressor of both the endogenous IL-2 and IFNγ loci. Conversely, Foxp3 also binds to the endogenous promoter regions of the Foxp3-induced GITR, CD25, and CTLA-4 genes, and this is associated with increased histone acetylation. These results suggest that Foxp3 recruits histone acetyltransferase enzymes, which are powerful co-activators of transcription, to these loci and provide a potential explanation for why Foxp3 induces expression of the GITR, CD25, and CTLA-4 genes while repressing expression of the IL-2 and IFNγ genes. This type of behavior is exhibited by members of the Foxo forkhead subfamily, which have been shown to interact with both histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase complexes (33van der Smidt M.P. Heide L.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 81-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Indeed, Foxp3 was recently shown to interact with CREB-binding protein in transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells (34Grant C. Oh U. Fugo K. Takenouchi N. Griffith C. Yao K. Newhook T.E. Ratner L. Jacobson S. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but whether Foxp3 can recruit this histone acetyltransferase to gene promoters in T cells is not known. Several important questions remain, including how Foxp3 function is regulated, whether Foxp3 promoter occupancy requires direct DNA binding, which co-repressor or co-activator complexes are recruited by Foxp3 to the promoters of Foxp3-responsive genes, and whether regulation of chromatin structure is necessary for the gene regulation by Foxp3. Our data offer important insights into how Foxp3 may regulate gene expression and Treg function and support a scenario in which Foxp3 is responsive to signals from the TCR and can function either as a direct repressor or activator of transcription. Furthermore, our results imply that the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase-containing co-activator versus histone deacetylase-containing co-repressor complexes may act as a context-dependent biochemical switch that determines the specific regulatory activity of Foxp3 at a given gene.

https://openalex.org/W2084825432,"A long-standing debate in evolutionary biology concerns whether species diverge gradually through time or by punctuational episodes at the time of speciation. We found that approximately 22% of substitutional changes at the DNA level can be attributed to punctuational evolution, and the remainder accumulates from background gradual divergence. Punctuational effects occur at more than twice the rate in plants and fungi than in animals, but the proportion of total divergence attributable to punctuational change does not vary among these groups. Punctuational changes cause departures from a clock-like tempo of evolution, suggesting that they should be accounted for in deriving dates from phylogenies. Punctuational episodes of evolution may play a larger role in promoting evolutionary divergence than has previously been appreciated."

A notable evolutionary switch occurred in one such protease network that is involved in protein digestion in the intestine. In vertebrates, this is largely the work of trypsin family serine proteases, whereas in invertebrates, cysteine proteases of the papain family and aspartic proteases assume the role. Utilizing a combination of protease class-specific inhibitors and RNA interference, we deconvoluted such a network of major endopeptidases functioning in invertebrate intestinal protein digestion, using the parasitic helminth, Schistosoma mansoni as an experimental model.

Proteolytic enzymes (proteases) are ubiquitous enzymes that operate in virtually every biological phenomenon. They function not only as individual enzymes but often in cascades or networks (1Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes, 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London2004Google Scholar). Digestion of proteins in the intestine is one noteworthy example of the function of multiple proteases of different classes as part of a coordinated physiological process. In vertebrates, protein digestion is largely the work of pancreas-derived serine proteases, primarily members of the trypsin family (clan PA). This group of enzymes is remarkably conserved among vertebrates. A very different picture emerges from analysis of intestinal protein digestion by invertebrates. Here cysteine proteases of the clan CA (also known as the papain family) and aspartic proteases homologous to cathepsin D (clan AA) have been described in the gut of organisms as diverse as platyhelminths (2Yamasaki H. Kominami E. Aoki T. Parasitol. Res. 1992; 78: 574-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), nematodes (3Brown A. Burleigh J.M. Billett E.E. Pritchard D.I.

McKerrow H.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The transition from cysteine/aspartic to serine proteases appears to have occurred in arthropods or mollusks. A proteolytic cascade or network involving aspartic and cysteine proteases has been proposed as catalyzing hemoglobin degradation in the blood-feeding helminths (7Sajid M. McKerrow H.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 8Williamson A.L. Brindley P.J. Knox D.P. Hotez P.J. Loukas A. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 417-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, several important biochemical questions remain unanswered. Is degradation of host proteins a systematic hierarchical event with individual proteases performing precise cleavage events in sequence? Or alternatively, is protein digestion functionally redundant, irrespective of both substrate and protease? Do certain substrates bias the activities of proteases, whereby they are “preferred” by some proteases but not by others? To begin to address these issues, we have chosen as a model digestive pathway that of the blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni. This organism utilizes a number of proteases to digest hemoglobin and host serum proteins to maintain successful parasitism of its human host (9Caffrey C.R. McKerrow J.H. Salter J.P. Sajid M. Trends Parasitol. 2004; 20: 241-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is a major global health problem affecting over 200 million people (10Chitsulo L. Engels D. Montresor A. Savioli L. Acta Tropica. 2000; 77: 41-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). It is caused by several species of schistosomes, or blood flukes, of which S. mansoni is a convenient experimental model and a major agent of disease in the Middle East, Africa, and South America. Following the invasion of human skin by aquatic larvae (cercariae), immature parasites (schistosomula) enter the vascular system and in 5-6 weeks mature to adults, which pair and produce eggs. Larval development, adult worm viability, and production of eggs by female worms are all dependent on the acquisition of nutrients from the host bloodstream, including hemoglobin from red blood cells (11Zussman R.A. Bauman P.M. Petruska J.C. J. Parasitol. 1970; 56: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the abundant serum proteins. Remarkably, no serine proteases have been localized to the gut lumen or gastrodermis of schistosomes, so the proteases involved in digestion are clearly distinct from those key to vertebrate digestion. Three other classes of proteases have been implicated in host protein digestion and localized to the gut of S. mansoni. These include a metallo-aminopeptidase (12McCarthy E. Stack C. Donnelly S.M. Doyle S. Mann V.H. Brindley P.J. Stewart M. Day T.A. Maule A.G. Dalton J.P. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and a cathepsin D-like aspartic protease as well as cysteine proteases, including a cathepsin B, a cathepsin L (also known as cathepsin F), a cathepsin C, and an asparaginyl endopeptidase (reviewed in Refs. 9Caffrey C.R.

Adv. Parasitol. 1999; 43: 161-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise function each of these enzymes plays in degradation of host nutrients remains speculative and occasionally controversial (9Caffrey C.R. McKerrow J.H. Salter J.P. Sajid M.

Identifying the key enzymes that facilitate host nutrient degradation is important not only to understand the biology and pathogenesis of schistosome infection but also to identify those enzymes that might be the most suitable targets for the development of new chemotherapy. Previous studies have suggested that inhibitors of either cysteine proteases (16Wasilewski M.M. Lim K.C. Phillips J. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem.

In order to address how such a network or cascade of proteases might function in the schistosome gut, we focused on the endopeptidases, cathepsin B1, D, and L1, and the asparaginyl endopeptidase, which may function to trans-activate the cathepsin B1 zymogen (19Dalton J.P. Brindley P.J. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized a combination of class-specific protease inhibitors and transcriptional silencing to deconvolute the specific roles and dynamic interplay of these schistosome gut-derived proteases in host protein degradation.

Preparation of Worm Extract—Three-week-old worms (∼100) were washed thoroughly in 37 °C prewarmed 0.85% saline and homogenized on ice with a pellet pestle motor (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). Extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Determination of Protein Concentration—Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (24Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-25425Crossref PubMed Scopus (214159) Google Scholar), using reagents obtained from Bio-Rad, on a Spectramax Plus 384 spectraphotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in triplicate for each sample. Cathepsin B and Cathepsin L Activity Assays—Enzyme activity was monitored at room temperature, in black microtiter plates (Corning Glass), by hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrates Z-Phe-Arg-AMC for cathepsin L (CatL) and cathepsin B (CatB), and Z-Arg-Arg-AMC for CatB (25Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Worm extract (0.2 μg) was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature in 100 μl of 100 mm phosphate citrate, 2 mm DTT, pH 5.5. Substrates (stocks of 10 mm in Me2SO) in 100 μl of the same buffer were then added to give a final concentration of 20 μm. Release of the free AMC was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 460 nm, respectively, in a Flexstation spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices), for 10 min. Assays were performed in duplicate. To confirm that CatL and CatB activity was being measured, worm extract in buffer was preincubated for 10 min prior to substrate addition with E-64, a general clan CA cysteine protease inhibitor (26Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), or CA-074, a selective inhibitor of CatB (27Murata M.

Cathepsin D Activity Assay—Enzyme activity was monitored by cleavage of the quenched fluorogenic decapeptide substrate Mca-Gly-Lys-Pro-Ile-Leu-Phe-Phe-Arg-Leu-Lys(Dnp)-Arg (28Yasuda Y. Kageyama T. Akamine A. Shibata M. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Worm extract (2 μg) was preincubated for 10 min in 100 μl of 100 mm phosphate citrate, 1 mm iodoacetamide (IAA), pH 4.0. Substrate (1 mm stock in Me2SO) in 100 μl of the same buffer was added to give a final concentration of 2 μm. Fluorescence from the substrate hydrolysis was measured for 10 min at excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 393 nm, respectively. To confirm that cathepsin D (CatD) activity was being measured, worm extract was preincubated for 10 min with a 20 μm concentration of the aspartic protease inhibitor, pepstatin A (PA), prior to the addition of the substrate (29Umezawa H. Aoyagi T. Morishima H. Matsuzaki M. Hamada M. Takeuchi T. J. Antibiotics. 1970; 23: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Asparaginyl Endopeptidase Activity Assay—Enzyme activity was monitored by hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-AMC (30Kembhavi A.A. Buttle D.J. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Worm extract (2 μg) was preincubated for 10 min in 100 μl of 100 mm phosphate citrate, 2 mm DTT, 20 μm E-64, pH 6.0. Substrate (10 mm stock Me2SO) in 100 μl of the same buffer was added at a final concentration of 20 μm. Fluorescence was measured for 20 min as described above, and assays were performed in duplicate. To confirm that asparaginyl endopeptidase (AE) activity was being measured, worm extract in buffer was preincubated for 10 min prior to substrate addition with the aza-peptide epoxide MG-256 (31Asgian J.L. James K.E. Li Z.Z. Carter W. Barrett A.J. Mikolajczyk J. Salvesen G.S. Powers J.C. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 4958-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 20 μm. Labeling of GIC with the Radiolabeled Cysteine Protease Inhibitors 125I-DCG-04 and 125I-KMB09—GIC was preincubated for 10 min with 10 μm K11777, E-64, Z-Phe-Ala-DMK, CA-074, MG-256, Z-Phe-Phe-DMK, or IAA (1 mm) at room temperature in 100 mm phosphate citrate, 2 mm DTT, pH 4.0. Subsequently, GIC was incubated in the presence of 125I-DCG-04 (32Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) or 125I-KMB09 (33Kato D. Boatright K.M. Berger A.B. Nazif T. Blum G. Ryan C. Chehade K.A.H. Salvesen G.S. Bogyo M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) for 1 or 2 h, respectively, at room temperature. To assess the selectivity of CA-074 and Z-Phe-Phe-DMK against CatB and CatL over time, preincubation times with the inhibitors were 10 and 40 min prior to the addition of 125I-DCG-04. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% Tris-glycine Criterion gels; Bio-Rad) and analyzed using a Typhoon Trio 8600 Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphorimaging mode. Feeding of S. mansoni with Fluorescently Labeled Hemoglobin and Albumin—Three-week old worms were incubated for 1 h with 50 μg of Rh-BSA, Rh-Hb, or 10 μg of DQ Red BSA at 37 °C in 1 ml of SCM. Worms were preincubated for 1 h with 10 or 20 μm cysteine protease inhibitors (K11777, Z-Phe-Ala-DMK, E-64, or E-64D) or aspartic protease inhibitors (PA, API-1, API-2, EA-1 (34Bi X. Haque T.S.

Following feeding, worms were washed five times with 0.85% saline, and rhodamine and bodipy fluorescence (excitation/emission: 541/572 and 590/620 nm, respectively) was visualized by microscopy on the LSM 510 PASCAL confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) or on an AXIO Imager.M1 (Carl Zeiss) with the Texas Red filter (excitation/emission: 595/615 nm, respectively). Fig. 1 confirms that when Rh-BSA degradation products are generated by proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) on SDS-PAGE (A), there is a corresponding increase in fluorescence (B), as measured on a Flexstation spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). Degradation of Hemoglobin and Albumin by GIC—Five μg each of human hemoglobin (α and β chains; Sigma) and mouse albumin (Sigma) were incubated in the presence of GIC (1 μg) in a total volume of 30 μl for 6 h at 37 °C. To monitor the effect of pH on the activity of the GIC, the assays were performed at pH values ranging from 3.5 to 8.0, in 100 mm phosphate citrate, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT. To assess the contribution of the different protease classes to hydrolysis, worm GIC was preincubated for 10 min with cysteine protease inhibitors IAA (1 mm), K11777, CA-074, or KMB-09 or with the aspartic protease inhibitor PA (all 10 μm). A Me2SO control was also performed. Assays were carried out at pH 4.0. Cleavage products were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 10-20% Tris-Tricine Ready Criterion gels for hemoglobin and 10-20% Tris-glycine Criterion gels for albumin. Gels were scanned on a Typhoon 8600 variable mode imager using excitation and emission wavelengths of 633 and 670 nm, respectively. Band intensity was determined with ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were later stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad). To evaluate the effect of protein conformation on hydrolysis, native or denatured (by boiling for 10 min in the presence of 25 mm DTT) 125I-BSA was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with GIC (1 μg) in 100 mm phosphate citrate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 4.0, or pH 6.5. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 10-20% Tris-glycine Criterion gels and visualized using a Typhoon 8600 Imager in phosphorimaging mode. Degradation of Rh-Hb and DQ Red BSA by S. mansoni Extracts—Worm extracts (2 μg) were incubated at 37 °C with 5 μg of Rh-Hb or 1 μg of DQ red BSA in 100 mm phosphate citrate, 2 mm DTT, pH 4.0, in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction was stopped after 24 h by adding 75 μl of 0.6 n trichloroacetic acid. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant (50 μl) was added to 150 μl of water. Fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 541 and 590 nm, respectively, for Rh-Hb and 590 and 620 nm, respectively, for DQ red BSA, in a Flexstation spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices). Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) Synthesis—A 400-700-bp fragment was amplified from S. mansoni adult worm cDNA for the target protease genes SmCB1.1, SmCL1, SmCD, and SmAE with gene-specific primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA; Table 1). Amplicons were cloned into the PCR-II Topo vector (Invitrogen). A resynthesized GC-balanced gene for Plasmodium berghei metacaspase 1 4M. Sajid, unpublished results. was chosen as a control to monitor any off-target dsRNA effect on the worms. Also, BLAST analysis against the S. mansoni genome data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.genedb.org/genedb/smansoni/blast.jsp) was used to rule out any sequence identity of 20 nucleotides or more with other Schistosoma genes. A T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence (underlined) was included at the 5′-end of both the forward and reverse gene-specific primers: 5′-AAG TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′. Two separate single promoter transcription reactions were carried out for each cDNA template. dsRNA was synthesized with the T7 RiboMax Express RNAi System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, in vitro transcription was carried out with 5 μl of unpurified single-T7 promoter PCR product/20-μl reaction (reactions were scaled up to 200 μl). Following a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, single-stranded RNAs were pooled, heated at 70 °C for 10 min, and cooled down to ambient temperature for 20 min to allow dsRNA annealing. The dsRNA was treated with RNase A and DNase to remove any remaining single-stranded RNA and the DNA template and then purified with the Megaclear kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove salts toxic to the worms and stored at -80 °C in the elution solution. dsRNA integrity was verified by nondenaturing 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and its purity was accessed by the ratio A260/A280 (if the value was equal or superior to 2, the dsRNA sample was considered relatively free of protein). The dsRNA concentration was determined by UV light absorbance at 260 nm (one A260 unit equals 40 μg/ml dsRNA) on an ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Typically, the in vitro transcription reaction yielded 4-5 μg/μl dsRNA.TABLE 1PCR and real time PCR primers and GenBank™ accession numbers for genes used in RNA interference studiesGenes and GenBank™ accession numbersForward primers and positionsReverse primers and positionsPCR primersSmCB1.1 (AJ506157)5′-atgctcacatctattttgtgtattgc-3′ (1–26)5′-caataccttccttcacccagtaatc-3′ (502–526)SmCL1 (U07345)5′-gcctgtaaacctcgagtacttagg-3′ (33–56)5′-cccatttttatgattgattcataggc-3′ (553–578)SmCD (U60995)5′-ggtatagttgaatctccagtattctc-3′ (590–625)5′-catctgaaagaagtttagaaaaggcg-3′ (1252–1277)SmAE (AJ250582)5′-gaagtatccgatgaaactgttagtg-3′ (76–100)5′-gcatataattcatcatcagggaaagc-3′ (472–497)rPbMC1 (GC balanced gene of AJ555625)5′-cactacgttaagatctactgggac-3′ (64–87)5′-ggacttgtagatggagatgttttc-3′ (556–579)Real time PCR primersSmCB1.1 (AJ506157)5′-acttggtgggcacgctatac-3′ (849–868)5′-taattcgaccggctgttacc-3′ (1018–1037)SmCB1.2 (AJ506158)5′-gaggaagagacgtcccacag-3′ (219–238)5′-ttcgatcactcattgcttcg-3′ (388–407)SmCL1 (U07345)5′-ttcgcacgcactcatctaac-3′ (256–275)5′-gttttgcggaaccactgact-3′ (467–486)SmCD (U60995)5′-ttgctgatactggcacttcg-3′ (801–820)5′-tgaaaccggttaggcaaatc-3′ (1034–1053)SmCC (Z32531)5′-acaccgattcgtaaccaagg-3′ (730–749)5′-atccttcggagtaggggcta-3′ (883–902)S. mansoni actin (U19945)5′-cagtgttcccttccatcgtt-3′ (133–152)5′-ggacagggtgttcttctgga-3′ (357–376) Open table in a new tab Treatment of S. mansoni with dsRNA— dsRNA was precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes of 95% ethanol, and the RNA pellet was resuspended in SCM at a concentration of 1 μg/μl. dsRNA (400 μg) was added to 100 3-week-old worms in 1 ml of SCM, and the medium was changed every 48 h. After 6 days in culture, worms were homogenized or frozen at -80 °C. cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was isolated from homogenized worms using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was resuspended in 30 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water and incubated at 50 °C for 10 min for complete dissolution. The concentration of RNA was determined at 260 nm on an ND-1000 spectrophotometer. For each RNAi-treated sample, 2 μg of total RNA were treated with 2 units of DNase I (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. After the addition of the stop solution, RNA mixtures were heated at 70 °C for 10 min and then chilled on ice. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and using random hexamers as primers. For each sample, a reaction was performed omitting reverse transcriptase as a control for genomic DNA contamination. Control PCRs were performed on each reverse transcription reaction with SmCD PCR primers. Quantification of the Transcript Levels by Real Time PCR— Forward and reverse primers (Table 1) were designed to amplify a 150-300 bp fragment for SmCB1.1, SmCB1.2, SmCC, SmCD, SmCL1, and S. ma"

Here we show that, despite abundant extracellular nutrients, interleukin-3-deprived hematopoietic cells begin to catabolize intracellular lipids. Constitutive Akt activation blunts the increased β-oxidation that accompanies growth factor withdrawal, and in growth factor-replete cells, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is required to suppress lipid catabolism. Surprisingly, PI3K and Akt exert these effects by suppressing expression of the β-oxidation enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A). Cells expressing a short hairpin RNA against CPT1A fail to induce β-oxidation in response to growth factor withdrawal and are unable to survive glucose deprivation. When CPT1A is constitutively expressed, growth factor stimulation fails to repress β-oxidation. As a result, both net lipid synthesis and cell proliferation are diminished. Together, these results demonstrate that modulation of CPT1A expression by PI3K-dependent signaling is the major mechanism by which cells suppress β-oxidation during anabolic growth.

Single-cell eukaryotes like yeast autonomously regulate their uptake of nutrients from the extracellular environment. In such organisms, cellular metabolism is regulated primarily in response to nutrient availability (1Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been proposed that mammalian cells do not take up and metabolize nutrients without instruction from extracellular signals. These signals, which include cytokines and other lineage-specific growth factors, stimulate signal transduction pathways that orchestrate cellular metabolism through effects on gene expression and enzyme kinetics. Together, these signal-induced changes function to direct uptake and utilization of nutrients, channeling metabolites into biosynthetic pathways (2Hedeskov C.J. Biochem. J. 1968; 110: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Vander Heiden M.G. Plas D.R. Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5899-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). One important example of this phenomenon occurs during lymphocyte stimulation, where receptor-induced signaling directly increases glucose transport, glycolysis, lactate production, and synthesis of lipids (5Cooper E.H.

Many of the metabolic changes elicited by growth factors result from activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt 4The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase; IL-3, interleukin-3; CPT I, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; CPT1A, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, isoform A; myrAkt, myristoylated Akt; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; GFP, green fluorescent protein; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; qPCR, quantitative reverse-transcriptase-PCR; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 4The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase; IL-3, interleukin-3; CPT I, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; CPT1A, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, isoform A; myrAkt, myristoylated Akt; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; GFP, green fluorescent protein; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; qPCR, quantitative reverse-transcriptase-PCR; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. signaling system. In this pathway, binding of a growth factor to its surface receptor induces activation of the lipid kinase PI3K, which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol species (10Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar). End products of PI3K activity recruit the serine/threonine kinase Akt to the plasma membrane where it becomes a substrate for phosphorylation and activation by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 and other regulatory kinases (10Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar). The metabolic effects of growth factor-induced PI3K/Akt stimulation include increases in glucose import and glycolysis, which fuel the bioenergetic and biosynthetic activities of growing cells (11Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12041-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 13Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of PI3K and/or Akt through a variety of genetic mechanisms is a common transforming event in human cancer, including some 25% of breast carcinoma and 30% of colon carcinoma (14Luo J. Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar, 17Samuels Y. Wang Z. Bardelli A. Silliman N. Ptak J. Szabo S. Yan H.

Cancer cells with constitutive Akt activity have a growth factor-independent ability to take up glucose and channel it into biosynthetic pathways, adopting a glucose-driven metabolism long known to characterize rapidly proliferative tumors (18Warburg O. Klin. Wochenschr. Berl. 1925; 4: 534-536Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Plas D.R. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7435-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Therefore, Akt activation supports anabolic metabolism in non-transformed cells and contributes to autonomous growth in tumor cells. The net synthesis of lipids, particularly phospholipids for daughter cell membranes, is required for cell proliferation. Inhibition of lipid synthesis is an effective strategy to suppress proliferation of various cell types (20Kuhajda F.P. Jenner K. Wood F.D. Hennigar R.A. Jacobs L.B. Dick J.D. Pasternack G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6379-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 21Pizer E.S. Wood F.D. Heine H.S. Romantsev F.E. Pasternack G.R. Kuhajda F.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1189-1193PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that stimulation of PI3K/Akt increases cellular synthesis of fatty acids from glucose and other precursors (22Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 24Van de S e T. De Schrijver E. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Swinnen J.V. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 642-646PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acids are important metabolic intermediates, because they can either be used for lipid synthesis and protein modification (e.g. palmitoylation, myristoylation, and synthesis of glycerophosphatidylinositol anchors), or they can be degraded through mitochondrial β-oxidation, which produces substrates that maintain ATP generation through oxidative phosphorylation. In the liver, the rate of β-oxidation is determined by the malonyl-CoA-dependent allosteric regulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), an enzyme located on the outer mitochondrial membrane that esterifies long chain fatty acids to carnitine, thereby initiating mitochondrial import (25McGarry J.D. Mannaerts G.P. Foster D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 28Foster D.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1033: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Such dynamic regulation of lipid synthesis/degradation allows hepatocytes to oscillate between postprandial lipid synthesis and fasting-induced lipid degradation. Whether lipid metabolism is similarly regulated in cells undergoing a growth factor-induced proliferative response has not been investigated. Therefore, we have examined the regulation of β-oxidation during cell growth and survival of hematopoietic cells. In the quiescent state, hematopoietic cells oxidize fatty acids obtained from the extracellular milieu and from intracellular lipids, and these activities allow them to survive glucose withdrawal. When stimulated to proliferate, hematopoietic cells commit to net lipid synthesis by suppressing β-oxidation and concomitantly inducing lipid synthesis. The ability to suppress β-oxidation is required for these cells to achieve maximal rates of proliferation. Surprisingly, this suppression results primarily from modulation of CPT1A expression rather than its enzyme activity. These results identify a novel mechanism used to modulate lipid metabolism in proliferating cells. Cell Culture and Reagents—IL-3 dependent, bax–/– bak–/– cells have been described (29Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H. Li C. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 2005; 120: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar) and were used here to avoid the confounding variable of apoptotic cell death. In other experiments, IL-3-dependent FL5.12 cells were studied. The IL-3-dependent, bax–/– bak–/– cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini); 3 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-3 (BD Pharmingen); HEPES buffer (9 mm, Invitrogen); β-mercaptoethanol (50 μm, Sigma); penicillin G and streptomycin sulfate (91 units/ml and 91 μg/ml, respectively, Invitrogen). All cultures was performed at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To withdraw cells from IL-3, they were washed three times and resuspended in complete medium lacking IL-3. To restimulate cells, they were pelleted and resuspended in complete medium containing IL-3. Cell size and concentration were determined using a Coulter Z2 particle analyzer or a hemocytometer. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Cell Signaling) was diluted in Me2SO to make a stock, and then diluted further in culture medium. Lipid Metabolism Assays—To measure lipid synthesis, cells were pelleted and resuspended in medium supplemented with [14C]glucose or palmitic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). For Fig. 1A, cells were cultured with 5.8 μCi of d-[6-14C]glucose/106 cells or 0.013 μCi of palmitic acid-[carboxy-14C]/106 cells. Prior to addition to culture medium, palmitate was complexed to a 10% solution of essentially fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) by vortexing for 1 min. For other lipid synthesis assays, cells were cultured with d-[U-14C6]glucose. Cells were plated at an initial density of 0.3–0.5 × 106/ml and incubated for 24 h, then counted using a hemocytometer and harvested in triplicate aliquots. Labeled cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.4 ml of Triton X-100 (0.5% in H2O). Lipids were extracted using a modification of the Bligh-Dyer method (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) in which 1 ml of methanol, 2 × 1 ml of chloroform, and 1 ml of H2O were sequentially added, with vortexing. Samples were centrifuged, and the organic phase was transferred to a new tube, evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream, and resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform. To quantitate lipid synthesis, resuspended samples were transferred to scintillation vials with 2.5 ml of EcoLume (ICN Radiochemicals) and counted on a 1450 Microbeta Jet or Microbeta Trilux scintillation counter (Wallac). For fractionation of lipid species, samples were spotted onto glass microfiber chromatography paper impregnated with silicic acid (Varian) and separated by chromatography in hexanes:diethyl ether:acetic acid (170:30:1) with size standards. Lipid species were visualized with iodine vapor, cut from the paper, and transferred to scintillation vials for quantitation of radioactivity. In Fig. 1A, “total” lipid was determined by summing the activity from individual species, and bars represent lipid synthesis for the entire culture. β-Oxidation of fatty acids was measured by modifying previously described assays (31Brivet M. Slama A. Saudubray J.M. Legrand A. Lemonnier A. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1995; 32: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Buzzai M. Bauer D.E. Jones R.G. Deberardinis R.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Elstrom R.L. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in medium supplemented with [9,10-3H]palmitate complexed to BSA by vortexing a mixture of the palmitate and a 10% BSA solution at a 1:2 volume ratio. A total of 3.3 μl of [9,10-3H]palmitate and 6.7 μl of BSA were used per 1 ml of cell culture medium. Each sample used 0.5 × 106 cells in 1 ml of medium supplemented with the [9,10-3H]palmitate-BSA mixture and cultured for 24 h in 24-well plates. After 24 h, supernatant was applied to ion-exchange columns (Dowex 1X8–200, Sigma), and tritiated water was recovered by eluting with 2.5 ml of H2O. A 0.75-ml aliquot was then used for scintillation counting. For each data point, eight samples were prepared, four cultured without and four with 0.2 mm (+)-etomoxir sodium (Sigma), an inhibitor of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation. To determine β-oxidation rate, a ranked pair analysis was used to determine the difference between oxidation counts in the absence and presence of etomoxir. The outlier among the four resulting values was discarded, and average and standard deviations were determined for the three remaining values. To measure β-oxidation of endogenous lipid, 75 × 106 cells were labeled in 150 ml of IL-3-containing medium supplemented with a [9,10-3H]palmitate-BSA mixture. This mixture was prepared by adding 40 μCi of [9,10-3H]palmitate to 1 ml of a20 μm unlabeled palmitate stock in a solution of 10% essentially fatty acid-free BSA. This mixture was added to 150 ml of pre-warmed medium for culture. Cells were cultured for 2 days, and then harvested and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. The supernatant from the third wash contained negligible radioactivity. The labeled, washed cells were then cultured at a density of 0.25 × 106 cells/ml in medium either containing or lacking IL-3 and containing or lacking etomoxir (0.2 mm). On subsequent days, aliquots of 0.5 ml were withdrawn from each flask, pelleted to remove cells, and applied to ion-exchange columns as above for determination of radioactivity. When cell density in IL-3-containing cultures exceeded 0.6 × 106/ml, more medium was added to culture, and total dilution was used to correct oxidation counts. DNA Constructs—The murine Akt-1 containing a Src myristoylation sequence fused to the N terminus (myrAkt) was described elsewhere (33Edinger A.L. Thompson C.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The Akt1 open reading frame from this vector was subcloned into the expression vector, pBabe-IRES-GFP to create the vector pBabe-myrAkt-IRES-GFP. The CPT1A cDNA was amplified from murine liver cDNA and cloned into PCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The insert was then cloned as an EcoRI fragment into the retroviral construct MIGR1-GFP, creating MIGR1-GFP-CPT1A. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) experiments used a published approach to express an shRNA under control of the human U6 RNA polymerase III promoter (34Fox C.J. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Master S.R. Chodosh L.A. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1841-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Briefly, a PCR product was generated from the plasmid pEF6-hU6 using primers that also contained a hairpin sequence against the CPT1A 19-mer 5′-GGCATAAACGCAGAGCATT-3′. This PCR product was cloned into pEF6-TOPO, and then the promoter and hairpin were shuttled to a pBabe-puro-derived construct (34Fox C.J. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Master S.R. Chodosh L.A. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1841-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Cell Lines—The myrAkt-overexpressing clones and empty vector control cells for Figs. 2 and 3 were generated by electroporating IL-3-dependent bax–/– bak–/– cells with 8 μgof pBabe-myrAkt-IRES-GFP by Nucleofector Solution V (Amaxa) using program T20. Five days later, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to generate a bulk population of myrAkt-expressing cells. Stable clones were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting with sorting into 96-well round bottom plates, and clones expressing high levels of myrAkt were identified by Western blotting. The shRNA clones and vector controls from Fig. 6 were generated in a similar fashion. Clones were screened by withdrawing cells from IL-3 and performing Western blots against CPT1A. To generate CPT1A-overexpressing and vector control IL-3-dependent cells (Fig. 7), we prepared retrovirus by co-transfecting 293T cells (Lipofectamine, Invitrogen) with MIGR1-GFP or MIGR1-GFP-CPT1A and a helper virus plasmid. Two days later, supernatants containing retroviral particles were collected. To infect IL-3-dependent cells, 3 × 106 cells were collected and resuspended in 1 ml of retrovirus-containing medium. Polybrene was added to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml, and the sample was centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 90 min. Cells were cultured at 37 °C for 5 h, then given fresh complete medium. On the third day after infection, GFP-positive cells were harvested by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.FIGURE 3IL-3 stimulation of PI3K/Akt suppresses expression of CPT1A. A, cells were withdrawn from IL-3 for 3 days and then re-stimulated. Total RNA was harvested at the time points indicated and analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) for CPT1A abundance. Bars are average of three amplification reactions, with the CPT1A/β-actin ratio arbitrarily set to 1.0 for RNA collected from unstimulated cells (time 0). B, protein lysates were also collected from cells after a 3-day IL-3 withdrawal (time 0), or at various time points after re-stimulation (m, minutes; h, hours). Lysates were blotted and probed for CPT1A and for β-actin. As a control, protein was also collected from cells that had not been deprived of IL-3 (C). C, IL-3 withdrawn cells were re-stimulated with IL-3 in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY). Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 is normally observed within 15 min of IL-3 stimulation; LY abolished this phosphorylation, but not phosphorylation of STAT5, which is independent of PI3K activity (top four blots). After 48 h, protein was again collected and analyzed for CPT1A expression (bottom two blots). D, a vector clone and two clones overexpressing myrAkt were withdrawn from IL-3 for 1 day, and CPT1A abundance was compared with IL-3-stimulated cells by Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Increased CPT1A expression and β-oxidation are required for survival during withdrawal of glucose and growth factors.

Parental cells and a vector control clone (vec-1) are shown for comparison. Average β-oxidation activity and standard deviations are shown for three independent assays. B, parental IL-3-dependent cells, a vector control clone, and two shRNA clones were cultured in medium containing low glucose (0.3 mm) and no IL-3. Viability was determined by exclusion of propidium iodide at the indicated times. Each data point reflects the average and standard deviation for three cultures processed in parallel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7Constitutive CPT1A expression increases β-oxidation rate and decreases lipid synthesis and cell proliferation. A, IL-3-dependent cells were infected with a retroviral vector containing the mouse CPT1A cDNA (MIGR1-CPT1A). Abundance of CPT1A protein (top) and rate of β-oxidation (bottom) were determined in the presence of IL-3 and compared with cells infected with a control retrovirus (MIGR1-vec). B, vector control and CPT1A-overexpressing cells were assayed for their ability to convert [14C]glucose into lipids during IL-3 stimulation. Cells were cultured in the presence of [14C]glucose for 24 h, then lipids were harvested and analyzed by scintillation counting. Bars represent the average and standard deviations of three measurements. C, cells infected with MIGR1-vec (open circles) or MIGR1-CPT1A (filled circles) were analyzed for proliferation rate soon after retroviral infection. Cumulative population doublings were calculated over 6 days of culture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of Microarray Data—Microarray data using cDNA samples from the IL-3-dependent cell line FL5.12 were reported previously (34Fox C.J. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Master S.R. Chodosh L.A. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1841-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These experiments used cDNA samples prepared from triplicate cultures grown in the presence of IL-3 or 12 h after IL-3 withdrawal. cDNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix murine 11K oligonucleotide microarrays. Western Blotting—Protein lysates were made by lysing cells in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Cocktails 1 and 2, Sigma). Protein was quantitated using BCA Protein Assay reagent (Pierce). Protein electrophoresis used NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal total Akt and phospho-Akt (Sre-473, Cell Signaling Technology); monoclonal β-actin (Sigma); phospho-STAT5 A/B (Tyr-694/699, Upstate Biotech); and polyclonal CPT1A (a gift from Victor Zammit, Highland Research Institute, Scotland, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were anti-sheep (Upstate Biotech) anti-rabbit and anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were detected with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—For quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qPCR) analysis, total cellular RNA was prepared using Tri reagent (Sigma). Complementary DNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplifications and data generation were performed using TaqMan probe sets, a 7900HT Sequence Detection System, and the SDS2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). Amplifications for β-actin and CPT1A were performed in triplicate, and β-actin mRNA abundance was used to normalize CPT1A mRNA abundance. Standard deviations were generated using the formula, [(RQ)(ΔCt S.D.)/average ΔCt)]. Lymphocyte Experiments—Adult female C57/Bl6 mice were sacrificed according to established mouse care protocols and in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Pennsylvania. The spleen and lymph nodes (inguinal, axillary, and mesenteric) were harvested, crushed in Hanks' basic salt solution, and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+, supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. T lymphocytes were purified by negative selection using StemSep Mouse T-cell enrichment mixture (Stem Cell Technologies) and an AutoMACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec). After enrichment, T lymphocytes were either utilized directly for RNA, protein, and β-oxidation analysis, or were plated into wells pretreated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (Ebioscience) and anti-CD28 antibodies (BD Pharmingen) at 1 μg/ml each. Plated cells were cultured for 2 days, and then recombinant IL-2 was added to the medium at a concentration of 50 units/ml (PeproTech). After 2 more days, cells were harvested for RNA, protein, and β-oxidation analysis. To measure β-oxidation in T lymphocytes, 0.5 × 106 cells were plated into RPMI supplemented with [9,10-3H]palmitate-BSA as outlined above under “Lipid Metabolism Assays.” After a 4-h culture period, the medium was applied to ion-exchange resin as above. Growth Factor Stimulation Simultaneously Increases Lipid Synthesis and Suppresses Fatty Acid Oxidation—The cytokine growth factor IL-3 stimulates phospholipid synthesis by activating the PI3K/Akt system (35Bauer D.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Andreadis C. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Free fatty acids used for phospholipid synthesis might come from the extracellular pool, from an intracellular pool generated by de novo fatty acid synthesis using glucose and other substrates, or from both. To compare the effects of IL-3 signaling on lipogenesis using these two fatty acid pools, we cultured IL-3-dependent cells with 14C-labeled glucose or palmitate in the presence or absence of IL-3 and measured lipid synthesis. In the absence of IL-3, cells made a small amount of lipid using extracellular free fatty acids, but there was essentially no synthesis from glucose (Fig. 1A). By contrast, cells stimulated with IL-3 synthesized a larger amount of lipid using either substrate. IL-3 increased lipid synthesis from glucose by >100-fold (131.7 ± 28), whereas the increase in synthesis from palmitate was much less dramatic (3.2 ± 1). Under all conditions tested, phospholipid was the predominant lipid species synthesized, accounting for >75% of recovered 14C-containing lipid. A maximal rate of cell proliferation involves net synthesis of macromolecules and the avoidance of simultaneous synthesis and degradation of metabolic intermediates (“futile cycling”). Most cell types can degrade fatty acids through mitochondrial β-oxidation. We therefore tested whether growth factor stimulation affected the rate of β-oxidation. In absence of growth factor stimulation, IL-3-dependent cells exit the cell cycle and undergo progressive atrophy; re-introduction of IL-3 stimulates these quiescent cells to grow and re-enter the cell cycle (29Lum J.J.

Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in the absence of IL-3 for 3 days and then re-stimulated by IL-3 addition. Cell growth, proliferation, de novo lipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation were examined periodically over the course of the experiment. Quiescent cells regained maximal size within 2 days of IL-3 stimulation and had begun to proliferate exponentially by the third day (data not shown). Lipid synthesis increased within the first day of IL-3 stimulation and was at maximal levels by the third day, coinciding with the onset of exponential proliferation (Fig. 1B). By contrast, the quiescent cells had a relatively high rate of β-oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate, and this was rapidly and persistently suppressed by introduction of the growth factor (Fig. 1B). By 72 h after IL-3 re-addition, the oxidation rate was suppressed to baseline levels. Growth Factor Suppression of β-Oxidation Requires Stimulation of PI3K—The effects of IL-3 on lipid synthesis have been reported to require activation of PI3K (35Bauer D.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Andreadis C. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar); therefore, we examined the role of this signaling pathway in suppressing β-oxidation. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 increased β-oxidation rate in a dose-dependent fashion despite IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 2A). Because many metabolic effects of PI3K stimulation, including induction of lipid synthesis, are dependent on activation of Akt, we next examined the role of Akt in suppressing β-oxidation. To that end, a constitutively active allele of Akt was transfected stably into IL-3-dependent cells. Two independent clones expressing this construct maintained Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2B) and continued to suppress β-oxidation (Fig. 2C) after IL-3 withdrawal. Together, these results demonstrate that activation of the"

F., and Galina, A. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 39846–39855) mitochondrial hexokinase activity (mt-HK) plays a preventive antioxidant role because of steady-state ADP re-cycling through the inner mitochondrial membrane in rat brain. In the present work we show that ADP re-cycling accomplished by the mitochondrial creatine kinase (mt-CK) regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, particularly in high glucose concentrations. Activation of mt-CK by creatine (Cr) and ATP or ADP, induced a state 3-like respiration in isolated brain mitochondria and prevention of H2O2 production obeyed the steady-state kinetics of the enzyme to phosphorylate Cr. The extension of the preventive antioxidant role of mt-CK depended on the phosphocreatine (PCr)/Cr ratio. Rat liver mitochondria, which lack mt-CK activity, only reduced state 4-induced H2O2 generation when 1 order of magnitude more exogenous CK activity was added to the medium. Simulation of hyperglycemic conditions, by the inclusion of glucose 6-phosphate in mitochondria performing 2-deoxyglucose phosphorylation via mt-HK, induced H2O2 production in a Cr-sensitive manner. Simulation of hyperglycemia in embryonic rat brain cortical neurons increased both ΔΨm and ROS production and both parameters were decreased by the previous inclusion of Cr. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that mitochondrial kinase activity performed a key role as a preventive antioxidant against oxidative stress, reducing mitochondrial ROS generation through an ADP-recycling mechanism."

This model was inspired by observations in patient D.F. who seemed unable to use vision for perceptual tasks while retaining 'normal' visuomotor capacity. I found that D.F.'s performance is preserved in perceptual and visuomotor tasks when the required spatial information is hand-centered and impaired when the information is object-centered.
https://openalex.org/W1995642384,"Many mammals use whiskers to sense and navigate in their environment. And whiskers may turn out to be a must-have accessory for robots that need to do the same. An experiment using arrays of robotic whiskers has succeeded in converting bending moments measured at a whisker's base into a precise three-dimensional representation of the environment. Whiskers mimicking those of seals or rats might be useful for underwater tracking or tactile exploration. Several species of terrestrial and marine mammals with whiskers (vibrissae) use them to sense and navigate in their environment — for example, rats use their whiskers to discern the features of objects1, and seals rely on theirs to track the hydrodynamic trails of their prey2. Here we show that the bending moment — sometimes referred to as torque — at the whisker base can be used to generate three-dimensional spatial representations of the environment, and we use this principle to construct robotic whisker arrays that extract precise information about object shape and fluid flow. Our results will contribute to the development of versatile tactile-sensing systems for robotic applications, and demonstrate the value of hardware models in understanding how sensing mechanisms and movement control strategies are interlocked."

Fungal infections are successfully treated with azole and triazole drugs that inhibit fungal cytochromes P450 (P450s). 5The abbreviations used are: P450, cytochrome P450; Mtb, Mycobacterium tuberculosis; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism. 5The abbreviations used are: P450, cytochrome P450; Mtb, Mycobacterium tuberculosis; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism. A major target is the sterol demethylase (CYP51) and inhibition prevents synthesis of the membrane sterol ergosterol from lanosterol (1Akins R.A. Med. Mycol. 2005; 43: 285-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This compromises membrane integrity and induces fungal cell lysis. Newer generation azoles and triazoles (e.g. fluconazole and voriconazole) have less severe interactions with human P450s and are used systemically as well as topically (2Kale P. Johnson L.B. Drugs Today. 2005; 41: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, azoles are potent inhibitors of cell growth in mycobacteria and other actinobacteria (3McLean K.J. Marshall K.R.

These genera have in common a high proportion of P450s, suggesting that azoles exert effects by inhibiting one or more P450 isoforms critical to viability or efficient growth (6McLean K.J. Sabri M.

Currently, structures of three P450-antifungal azole complexes are available, showing direct coordination of heme iron by azole nitrogen in the case of Mtb CYP51 with fluconazole, Saccharopolyspora erythrae P450 eryF (CYP107A1) with ketoconazole, and rabbit microsomal CYP2B4 with bifonazole (9Podust L.M.

Understanding molecular interactions of azoles in P450 active sites provides a route for designing more specific azole-based inhibitors and for rationalizing (and avoiding) development of drug resistance (12Podust L.M.

However, if assuming a similar azole-nitrogen heme iron ligation occurs in Mtb CYP121, the tight binding of various azoles to Mtb CYP121 cannot easily be explained on the basis of the ligand-free CYP121 structure, given the constrained environment around the sixth heme coordination space (7Leys D.

Thus, we considered it important to obtain an atomic structure of an azole complex of this P450 given our previous studies that indicate CYP121's extremely tight binding of antifungal azoles (8McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and since azole binding mode could not be readily rationalized on the basis of the ligand-free structure. In work leading up to the crystallization of the fluconazole complex of CYP121, we established that the previously identified crystallization conditions are incompatible with co-crystallization or soaking experiments due to the low solubility of available tight-binding azole antifungals. Thus, to study binding mode of fluconazole to Mtb CYP121, we have defined new conditions compatible with the crystallization of CYP121 in both ligand-free and fluconazole-bound forms and have determined the Mtb CYP121 structure in presence/absence of fluconazole to 1.6 Å/1.9 Å, respectively. The data reveal an unprecedented mode of fluconazole coordination of the CYP121 heme iron via a bridging water molecule and highlight the importance of the position of I helix residues in controlling the nature of heme iron coordination by fluconazole in the P450.

Fluconazole-bound CYP121 was prepared by dissolving solid fluconazole into the protein solution in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, to a saturating concentration of ∼5 mm. Binding was monitored by absorption spectroscopy in 0.1-cm path length quartz cells, following the type II spectral shift induced on interaction with the drugs. Protein concentrations were ∼250 μm for absorbance, EPR, magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), and 5 mg/ml for crystallography, unless otherwise stated. MCD samples were prepared in 50 mm HEPES/D2O buffer, pH* 7.0, containing deuterated glycerol (50% v/v). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary UV-50 Bio scanning spectrophotometer using 1- or 0.1-cm path length quartz cells. X-Band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ER-300D series electromagnet and microwave source interfaced to a Bruker EMX control unit and fitted with an ESR-9 liquid helium flow cryostat from Oxford Instruments and a dual mode microwave cavity from Bruker (ER-4116DM). Quantification of S = ½ species was carried out by comparison with the spin standard Cu2+ (EDTA) using the method of Aasa and Vanngard (13Aasa R. Vanngard T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). Spectra of crystal slurries were taken using reduced volume EPR tubes. Magnetic circular dichroism spectra were recorded using the Jasco J730 model in the near-infrared region. An Oxford Instruments split coil superconducting solenoid SM-4 was used to generate a field of 5 tesla and a temperature of 4.2 K. Room temperature measurements were carried out using an Oxford Instruments SM-1 superconducting magnet with an ambient bore. MCD intensities are plotted as Δϵ (m-1 cm-1) at low temperature and Δϵ/H (m-1 cm-1 T-1) at room temperature. Room temperature MCD samples were prepared in 50 mm HEPES/D2O buffer, pH* 7.0. Deuterated glycerol (50% v/v) was added to the buffer for low temperature measurements. Crystallization of the CYP121-Fluconazole Complex— CYP121 was crystallized in the absence and presence of fluconazole by the sitting drop method at 4 °C. Sitting drops were prepared by adding 2 μl of mother liquor to 2 μl of 5 mg ml- enzyme. Fluconazole-bound CYP121 crystals were obtained by crystallizing the fluconazole-enzyme complex in the presence of mother liquor saturated with fluconazole (CYP121-Flu Kd = 5 μm). The well solution was 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.2 m NaSCN (±saturating fluconazole, as required). Crystals formed between 7 and 14 days. Crystals were immersed in mother liquor supplemented with 10% polyethylene glycol 200 as a cryoprotectant, before being mounted on a nylon loop and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data were collected from single crystals for the fluconazole complex and the fluconazole-free crystals at station ID 14.1, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. Data were reduced and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The structure was solved using molecular replacement program AMoRe (15Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The new crystal form obtained contains six molecules in the asymmetric unit, and co-crystallization under saturating fluconazole concentrations reveals fluconazole bound in five out of the six molecules (molecules A-E). For all six monomers, there is no significant difference in overall conformation between the fluconazole-bound and fluconazole-free crystal structures. Furthermore, the conformation of the five fluconazole-binding monomers is highly similar to the conformation observed in the previously determined ligand-free CYP121 structure (Fig. 1A). In contrast, CYP121 molecule F has a conformation distinct from both the previously determined CYP121 structure and that of the remaining five molecules for residues 78-102 (the C-C′ helix region). In molecule F, Met-86 fills most of the active site cavity and thus obstructs binding of fluconazole or other compounds in the vicinity of the heme group (Fig. 1B). Given the lack of any clearly identifiable substrate-binding pocket near the heme group, it is unclear whether this “closed” conformation represents a catalytically relevant state. Crystal packing likely influences the preference for this closed conformation as the C-C′ helix region makes several crystal packing contacts with molecule D. Active Site Structure of the CYP121-Fluconazole Complex— Electron density for bound fluconazole could be clearly identified in each of the five monomers displaying the “open” conformation. Surprisingly, two distinct fluconazole conformations were observed, with varying occupancies for each conformation in the individual active sites. Conformation 1 involves heme ligation distinct from the direct ligation that previously has been observed in other P450 azole complexes (Fig. 2). In this case, one of the fluconazole triazole groups binds to the water sixth heme ligand (water W1) in addition to forming a hydrogen bond with a second water molecule (water W2) that is, in turn, hydrogen-bonded to a heme propionate (Fig. 2E). The remainder of the fluconazole molecule is bound predominantly via hydrophobic interactions with residues Met-52, Val-78, Val-82, Val-83, and Phe-168, in addition to interactions with the heme macrocycle. In addition, there is a water-bridged hydrogen bond (via W3) between the fluconazole hydroxyl group and the main chain oxygen of Thr-229 and a direct contact between the second triazole group and Gln-385 and Thr-77 (Fig. 2E). While fluconazole bound to molecules B and C solely adopts this conformation, a mixture of two conformations is observed in the other active sites (relative occupancies were determined by correlation of the average B-factors for each conformation with those of nearby residues in the active site; values can be found in Table 2). In these cases, a dual conformation is only observed for the ligand atoms, while protein-derived atoms in the active site occupy a single conformation. Despite the partial occupancy of conformation 2, omit electron density maps calculated with only conformation 1 present in the model allowed unambiguous identification of the conformation 2 binding mode (Fig. 2). The relative occupancy of the individual conformations was estimated and modeled so that the average B-factors of both conformations resembled the average active site B-factors. Unlike the first conformation, the second conformation involves direct ligation of heme iron via one of the triazole moieties, similar to that observed for the aforementioned CYP51, CYP107A1, and CYP2B4 azole complexes (9Podust L.M. Poulos T.L. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3068-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 10Cupp-Vickery J.R. Garcia C. Hofacre A. Mcgee-Estrada K. J. Mol.

In addition to hydrophobic interactions made with the heme macrocycle, Thr-229, Phe-168, and Phe-280, there is a direct hydrogen bond between the non-ligating triazole and Arg-386, in addition to a water-mediated hydrogen bond between the fluconazole hydroxyl group and a heme propionate. This conformation is very similar to the geometry observed for the M. tuberculosis CYP51 fluconazole complex (9Podust L.M. Poulos T.L. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As for small molecule models of azole-ligated hemes or His-ligated hemoproteins (e.g. Ref. 17Walker F.A. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), the (tri)azole plane is expected to be perpendicular with the porphyrin macrocycle and the ligating nitrogen group linearly arranged with the iron and cysteinate sulfur atoms (Fig. 2). However, the observed direct fluconazole-CYP121 ligation deviates markedly from ideality. The triazole-ligating nitrogen atom is ∼0.7 Å away from a position along the iron-sulfur axis, while the triazole cycle is at a 25° angle with that axis. Close contacts of the ligating triazole group with the side chains of both Ala-233 and Ser-237, both residues from the I-helix positioned immediately above the heme plane, clearly block the triazole moiety from occupying a near-ideal ligation pattern. There is a strong correlation between estimated occupancy for the direct-ligation conformation and the position of the I helix (as judged by the distance between residues Ala-233 and Ser-237 with the iron; see Table 2) with the most extreme cases being CYP121 monomers B and C, which have no detectable conformation 2. In the available P450 heme-(tri)azole complex structures (8McLean K.J. Cheesman M.R. Rivers S.L. Richmond A. Leys D. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Munro A.W. J.

The CYP121-fluconazole complex represents the most extreme deviation from ideal geometry, while the geometry observed for the CYP2B4 bifonazole complex (10Cupp-Vickery J.R. Garcia C. Hofacre A. Mcgee-Estrada K. J. Mol.

Typically, distal coordination of P450 ferric heme iron by an azole leads to shift of the major (Soret) absorbance band to ∼424-425 nm. In CYP121, the Soret for the fluconazole complex is centered at ∼422 nm, suggesting an altered ligation mode and the formation of a low spin heme iron complex that may not involve exclusively direct iron-nitrogen ligation (Fig. 3A). The fact that normal saturation behavior is observed for the binding of fluconazole to CYP121 (i.e. a hyperbolic dependence of observed spectral shift on ligand concentration, reaching a defined plateau), as well as the obvious lack of any significant amount of ligand-free species contributing to the final spectrum (see Fig. 3A), appears to rule out incomplete ligand binding as the origin of the observed 422 nm Soret shift. EPR spectra of ligand-free CYP121 (Fig. 3B) have g-values at 2.48 (gz), 2.25 (gy), and 1.90 (gx), as reported previously (6McLean K.J. Sabri M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Lewis D.G. Clift D. Balding P.R. Dunford A.J. Warman A.J. McVey J.P. Quinn A.M. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Munro A.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and are comparable with those previously reported for other P450s, including the M. tuberculosis CYP51 (sterol demethylase) enzyme (2.44, 2.25, and 1.91). Thus, the spectrum of CYP121 in the absence of fluconazole has a typical rhombic triplet of signals arising from low spin cysteinate-coordinated ferric heme iron. The gz feature, the best resolved of the three features, is broad and shows some structure. This suggests a degree of heterogeneity within the low spin heme. On binding of fluconazole to CYP121, a rhombic spectrum is obtained that is shifted and sharpened with respect to the ligand-free enzyme. The g-values for this complex are 2.45, 2.26, and 1.90 (Fig. 3B). This shift is unexpected, and typical gz values for histidine- or imidazole-coordinated P450s lie in the range 2.65-2.50 (18Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, peak widths are narrower, and amplitudes are more intense than for the ligand-free CYP121. The EPR spectral features are thus consistent with a complex that has a substantial proportion of heme iron axially coordinated by cysteinate and an oxygen donor ligand. The gz values for such complexes in other P450s are typically in the range from ∼2.43 to 2.48 (e.g. 2.46 for the acetate complex of the Pseudomonas putida camphor hydroxylase P450 cam [CYP101A1]) (18Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MCD spectra were also recorded for the CYP121-fluconazole complex to provide further evidence supporting the novel coordination state observed in the crystals of the complex (Fig. 3C). MCD spectra of heme proteins are dominated by porphyrin π-π* transitions, which are perturbed by the heme iron and are therefore characteristic of the oxidation state (ferrous, ferric, ferryl) and spin state (low, high) of the heme iron. In the ferric state, ligand-to-metal charge transfer bands, which are weak and obscured in absorption spectra, are readily observed. Low spin ferric hemes give rise to a positive ligand-to-metal charge transfer feature (CTls) from the porphyrin-to-iron d-orbitals in the near-IR region of the spectra. This band is sensitive to the energies of the d-orbitals and shifts with changing heme ligation. The position of the band maximum can be used to assign heme ligands (20Gadsby P.M.A. Thomson A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5003-5011Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 21McKnight J. Cheesman M.R. Thomson A.J. Miles J.S. Munro A.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both low temperature (4.2 K) and room temperature MCD spectra of the CYP121-fluconazole complex were recorded to obtain detailed data for the low spin complex and to enable ligand assignment. As a prelude to this experiment, it was established that the UV-visible spectrum of the CYP121-fluconazole did not change in the presence of the glassing agent (deuterated glycerol), required for work at the low temperature. The room temperature MCD spectra (Fig. 3B) reveal a clear shift and decrease in intensity on fluconazole binding, where we assign the fluconazole bound form to be one in which fluconazole is mainly coordinated to heme iron via a water molecule. While we cannot rule out that a minor proportion of the sample is directly coordinated, the corresponding EPR spectrum (Fig. 3B) reveals a single species distinct from the ligand-free enzyme and proposed to be one in which fluconazole is coordinated via water. However, upon addition of 50% glycerol, two distinct low spin species are observed, the minor one of which (gz = 2.5) we assign as having direct fluconazole ligation to the iron (Fig. 3B). These two species are presumably those that give rise to the two bands observed in the low temperature MCD spectrum of the fluconazole-CYP121 complex (see below). The low temperature MCD spectra of the CYP121-fluconazole complex (which were recorded in both the visible and near-infrared regions) are consistent with a low spin ferric heme and spectral intensities are consistent with heme thiolate ligation (Fig. 3C). In the near-infrared region, a CTls band of low intensity is observed with a maximum of 1130 nm (equivalent to 1145 nm band at room temperature), which is in the region associated with cysteine/water ligation of heme iron in other cytochromes P450, such as P450 BM3 (21McKnight J. Cheesman M.R. Thomson A.J. Miles J.S. Munro A.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Low intensity (relative to, for example, histidine-coordinate heme proteins) is a feature of cysteine-coordinated hemes. This major feature is likely to reflect the indirect coordination of the fluconazole to the heme iron via a water molecule. A shoulder is observed at 1180 nm that is likely to arise from coordination of the fluconazole ligand directly to the heme iron, as observed in both the EPR spectrum of a glycerol containing sample, as well as for a proportion of monomers in the crystal structure. The large feature at 1000 nm is the vibrational sideband that is present in all CTls bands, although sometimes not well resolved at room temperature. The CYP121-Flu crystal structure contains a mixture of unliganded (monomer E, ∼15%), indirectly liganded (approximately 60%) and a proportion of directly ligated CYP121 (∼25%). An EPR spectrum from CYP121-Flu complex crystals indeed reveals multiple species (Fig. 3B) and can be interpreted as containing a mixture of ligand-free and CYP121 with heme iron both directly and indirectly coordinated by fluconazole. The CYP121-Flu complex structure and comparisons with active site structure and I helix conformation in other P450-azole complex structures highlight a hitherto unrecognized phenomenon with potential major impact on understanding of P450-drug interactions and rational inhibitor design. The CYP121-fluconazole structure demonstrates incontrovertibly that azole coordination of P450 heme can occur via a bridging water molecule, as well as (in the minor CYP121 conformation) directly to the iron. Spectroscopic studies in solution and on the crystal form support this conclusion and structural comparisons emphasize the importance of P450 I helix geometry in determining azole binding mode. The I helix region is a key determinant of the substrate selectivity and catalytic properties of the P450s and contains key residues that control e.g. substrate binding conformational features and oxygen activation (e.g. Refs. 22Raag R. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11420-11429Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar and 23Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In CYP121, it becomes clear from our structural data that the positioning of the I helix is crucial with respect to controlling the mode of binding of bulky azole drugs. The steric constraints imposed by the position of the I helix reveal a new and unexpected mode of binding for fluconazole to heme iron in this system, which occurs via a bridging water molecule. Spectroscopic studies both in solution and on the crystal complex are consistent with this finding and indicate that this indirect binding mode of fluconazole represents a high affinity state occupied in both crystal and solution states of the enzyme. These findings have major implications for understanding the interactions of this antifungal drug class with P450 heme and for the accurate modeling of protein-azole interactions that may be required for de novo azole drug design. Moreover, the novel binding mode also has clear relevance with respect to rationalizing azole drug resistance and its molecular determinants (e.g. Refs. 1Akins R.A. Med. Mycol. 2005; 43: 285-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar and 19McLean K.J. Clift D. Lewis D.G. Sabri M. Balding P.R. Sutcliffe M.J. Leys D. Munro A.W.

In conclusion, our data reveal an unexpected and novel binding mode for a clinically important drug class with its P450 protein target."
https://openalex.org/W2051478187,"Therapeutic induction of angiogenesis is a potential treatment for chronic ischemia. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are known to play an important role by their interactions with proangiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Low molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF), a sulfated polysaccharide from brown seaweeds that mimic some biological activities of heparin, has been shown recently to promote revascularization in rat critical hindlimb ischemia. In this report, we first used cultured human endothelial cells (ECs) to investigate the possible ability of LMWF to enhance the actions of VEGF165. Data showed that LMWF greatly enhances EC tube formation in growth factor reduced matrigel. LMWF is a strong enhancer of VEGF165-induced EC chemotaxis, but not proliferation. In addition, LMWF has no effect on VEGF121-induced EC migration, a VEGF isoform that does not bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Then, with binding studies using 125I-VEGF165, we observed that LMWF enhances the binding of VEGF165 to recombinant VEGFR-2 and Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), but not to VEGFR-1. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that LMWF binds with high affinity to VEGF165 (1.2 nm) and its receptors (5-20 nm), but not to VEGF121. Pre-injection of LMWF on immobilized receptors shows that VEGF165 has the highest affinity for VEGFR-2 and NRP1, as compared with VEGFR-1. Overall, the effects of LMWF were much more pronounced than those of LMW heparin. These findings suggested an efficient mechanism of action of LMWF by promoting VEGF165 binding to VEGFR-2 and NRP1 on ECs that could help in stimulating therapeutic revascularization.

Fucoidan is of particular pharmacological interest because, in addition to its non-animal origin, it exhibits anti-inflammatory activities, is a potent modulator of connective tissue proteolysis (15Senni K. Gueniche F. Foucault-Bertaud A. Igondjo-Tchen S. Fioretti F. Colliec-Jouault S. Durand P. Guezennec J. Godeau G. Letourneur D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 445: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but has low anticoagulant activity compared with heparin (16Chevolot L. Foucault A. Chaubet F. Kervarec N. Sinquin C.

Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1651: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). LMWF is also devoid of direct antithrombin effect (19Haroun-Bouhedja F. Ellouali M. Sinquin C. Boisson-Vidal C. Thromb. Res. 2000; 100: 453-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).Similar to heparin, fucoidan is also known to bind some proangiogenic growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor-1 and 2 (FGF-1 and 2), protecting them from proteolysis and enhancing their activity on ECs (20Belford D.A. Hendry I.A. Parish C.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Chabut D. Fischer A.M. Colliec-Jouault S. Laurendeau I. Matou S. Le Bonniec B. Helley D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). FGFs are known to induce angiogenesis in vivo by promoting proliferation and migration of ECs to form new capillaries (10Freedman S.B. Isner J.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 379-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Nugent M.A. Iozzo R.V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Fucoidan has been shown to enhance FGF-2 induced EC tube formation in matrigel (23Chabut D. Fischer A.M. Colliec-Jouault S. Laurendeau I. Matou S. Le Bonniec B. Helley D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a process that resembles in vivo vessel formation, and is a good index of angiogenic activity (25Auerbach R. Lewis R. Shinners B. Kubai L. Akhtar N. Clin. Chem. 2003; 49: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). While these studies present one explanation for the LMWF ability to aid in angiogenesis induction after ischemic damage, it is possible that this polysaccharide influences EC activity and angiogenesis in multiple ways. For instance, among the molecules implicated in the induction of and the control of angiogenesis, is the potent angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) (26Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7732) Google Scholar).VEGF-A is a well known angiogenic growth factor whose expression can be induced in response to hypoxia and ischemic damage (26Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7732) Google Scholar, 27Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). VEGF-A can act both by inducing EC proliferation and by stimulating EC migration (8Alon T. Hemo I. Itin A. Pe'er J. Stone J. Keshet E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar, 26Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat.

It has also been shown to be a pro-survival factor for ECs (29Chavakis E. Dimmeler S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It is a secreted glycoprotein with multiple splice variants (30Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 31Relf M. LeJeune S. Scott P.A. Fox S. Smith K. Leek R. Moghaddam A. Whitehouse R. Bicknell R. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 963-969PubMed Google Scholar). The most abundant splice variant, VEGF165, is known to bind heparin and heparan sulfates while another widely expressed form, VEGF121 lacks a heparin binding motif (26Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7732) Google Scholar). VEGF121 also has reduced mitogenic and migration inducing effects compared with VEGF165 (26Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7732) Google Scholar). While the consequences of VEGF165/heparin interaction are not fully understood, it is thought to help anchor the protein to the extracellular matrix and possibly influence presentation of VEGF165 to its receptors on the EC surface (26Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7732) Google Scholar). VEGF165 binds to two tyrosine kinase high affinity receptors, Flt-1 or VEGFR-1, and KDR/Flk-1 or VEGFR-2. The binding of VEGF165 to VEGFR-2 is enhanced by Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) expressed on endothelial cells, which acts a co-receptor, forming a complex with VEGFR-2 (32Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar).In the current in vitro study, we have tested the ability of LMWF to influence the cellular processes important to angiogenesis in ECs (25Auerbach R. Lewis R. Shinners B. Kubai L. Akhtar N. Clin. Chem. 2003; 49: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). We show that LMWF greatly enhances EC tube formation and migration, but not proliferation. Through the use of binding studies in purified systems, we demonstrate that LMWF binds to VEGF165 and its receptors and that LMWF promotes binding of VEGF165 to VEGFR-2 and NRP1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant human VEGF165, VEGF121, FGF-2, recombinant human VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2/Fc chimera, recombinant rat Neuropilin-1/Fc chimera used for these studies were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Unless specified, all chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma.Polysaccharides—The LMW fucoidan (LMWF) used for these studies was obtained by radical processing of HMW extracts from brown seaweed according to a protocol previously described (11Luyt C.E. Meddahi-Pelle A. Ho-Tin-Noe B. Colliec-Jouault S. Guezennec J. Louedec L. Prats H. Jacob M.P. Osborne-Pellegrin M. Letourneur D. Michel J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and patented (33Nardella, A., Chaubet, F., Sinquin, C., Colliec Jouault, S., Boisson-Vidal, C., Durand, P., and Jozefonvicz, J. (2000) Method for Obtaining Sulfated Polysaccharides, United States Patent 6,028,191Google Scholar). Number-average molecular mass (Mn) of LMWF was 5.1 ± 0.3 kDa, compared with 5.6 ± 0.3 kDa for LMW heparin (Sigma). All other polysaccharides (unfractionated heparin, unfractionated fucoidan, sulfated dextran, chondroidin sulfate) were from Sigma.Isolation of HUVEC—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from umbilical cords with 0.1% collagenase as described (21Giraux J.L. Matou S. Bros A. Tapon-Bretaudiere J. Letourneur D. Fischer A.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, the umbilical vein was cannulated and perfused with PBS to remove blood. It was then filled with 0.1% collagenase in PBS, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were flushed from the vein with PBS, centrifuged for 5 min at 180 × g and resuspended in 6 ml of endothelial cell basal medium II with all supplements (ECBM; Promocell, Germany) except heparin, and cultured in T25 flasks previously coated with collagen I (Iwaki, Japan). Throughout this study, cells of either passage 2 or 3 were used.Tube-forming Assay—Growth factor-reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, New Bedford, MA) was added to wells of a cold 96-well plate (45 μl/well), and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow gelling. HUVEC previously starved overnight were seeded onto the Matrigel with various concentrations of LMWF in either 1% FCS medium, 1% FCS + 20 ng/ml VEGF165, or full endothelial cell medium. Cell culture was carried out at 37 °C for 18 h in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were observed directly and scored on a scale of 0-5 for tube formation using dark field illumination on an inverted light microscope at low power (×40). Based on quality and number of the tubes, they were assigned numeric values: 0, no real tubes; 1, some poorly formed tubes; 2, some formed tubes; 3, network of tubes both formed and poorly formed; 4, network of formed tubes; and 5, network of well formed tubes. Score results from four random fields in duplicate wells were averaged. Photographs were also taken with a digital camera under the same conditions.Proliferation Assay—HUVEC were plated at 1 × 104 cells/well overnight into collagen coated 24-well dishes (Iwaki, Japan). After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with medium containing 5% FCS with either 20 ng/ml VEGF121, 10 ng/ml VEGF165, or 5 ng/ml FGF-2, with or without 10 μg/ml LMWF. EC medium and 5% FCS medium, with and without LMWF, were also tested. Cells in some wells were detached and counted immediately to obtain time = 0 counts. After 48 h of treatment, cells were detached and counted. Net cell number was determined by subtracting the time = 0 counts from the later counts. Experimental conditions were performed in triplicate on two separate occasions.Transwell Migration Assay—HUVEC motility was measured using BioCoat 24-Multiwell insert system (BD Biosciences) with 3-μm pore size polycarbonate filter insert that divides the chamber into upper and lower portions. The filters were coated with human recombinant fibronectin. Briefly, HUVEC that were previously starved overnight in 5% FCS, were trypsinized and resuspended in 0.1% FCS medium at a density of 4 × 105 cells/ml. 250 μl of this suspension were then added to the upper chamber of the insert while 750 μl of 0.1% FCS were added to the lower chamber. After 20 h in the absence or presence of polysaccharides (LMWF, unfractionated fucoidan, LMW heparin, unfractionated heparin, sulfated dextran, chondroitin sulfate), cells on the top of the filter were removed by gentle swabbing and the remaining cells on the bottom side of the filter were stained using 0.25% cresyl violet, and counted under a light microscope with an eyepiece grid to visualize set fields. At least four fields in duplicate wells were counted for each condition.VEGF Binding to Recombinant VEGF Receptors—Immulon-1B removal well strips (Dynatech Laboratories) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of 5 mg/ml anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) in PBS buffer. Nonspecific interactions were blocked with PBS containing 0.1% BSA in PBS by a further overnight incubation at 4 °C. Then, 5 ng/well of recombinant Neuropilin-1/Fc, VEGFR-1/Fc or VEGFR-2/Fc chimera were added followed by 32 pm 125I-VEGF165 as previously described (34Hamma-Kourbali Y. Vassy R. Starzec A. Le Meuth-Metzinger V. Oudar O. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Perret G. Crepin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39748-39754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed overnight at 4 °C in the absence or presence of LMWF or LMW heparin (0.001 to 1000 μg/ml). The wells were then washed and radioactivity was measured with a γ-counter. B and B0 are the bound radioactivity in the presence or in the absence of polysaccharide, respectively. Data are the average of 2-4 independent experiments carried out in triplicates. The EC50, concentration that produces 50% of the maximum response, was calculated from log-dose response curves.For competition experiments, biotinylated albumin-heparin (0.3 μg/ml) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the immobilized VEGF receptors (8.3 ng/immulon well), in the absence or presence of LMWF or LMW heparin. The wells were then washed and binding was revealed by streptavidin-peroxidase reaction at 405 nm on a multiskan UV reader. The IC50, concentration that produces 50% inhibition, was calculated from log-dose response curves.Seldi TOF Analysis—Cationic chip arrays CM10 and anionic chip arrays Q10 (Ciphergen Biosystems, CA) were employed. Spots were pre-wetted twice for 5 min with 10 μl of PBS. Samples were prepared by mixing 1 μg of recombinant VEGF receptors and/or 10-100 ng of VEGF165 in the presence or absence of 1 μg of LMWF, and applied to the spots. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The spots were washed, air-dried, and a saturated solution of sinapinic acid was applied twice to each spot. The chip arrays were analyzed using a protein chip reader (PBS II, Ciphergen Biosystems), calibrated using purified peptide and protein standards (Ciphergen Biosystems). Spectra were analyzed with proteinchip software (3.1.1 Ciphergen Biosystems). Normalization was performed by total ion current normalization function.Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—VEGF receptors (recombinant Neuropilin-1, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2/Fc chimera), VEGF121 or VEGF165 were coupled to the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip using standard amine coupling chemistry for analysis of ligand binding using a BIAcore 3000 optical biosensor (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Bovine serum albumin and goat anti-human Fc were used as controls. Following immobilization, residual activated ester groups were blocked by treatment with 1 m ethanolamine. NaCl, 3 m, was used to regenerate the sensor surface between analysis for LMWF and LMW heparin binding. Samples were diluted in running buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween-20). Flow cell, temperature, flow rate, sample volume, and mixing were selected with the BIAcore control software (BIAcore). The apparent binding affinities of LMWF and LMW heparin for VEGF165 and VEGF receptors were determined by analysis of the kinetic of the association assuming a 1:1 Langmuirian model using BIAevaluation software. Results are means of triplicate determinations.Statistical Analysis—For migration, proliferation, and tube formation assays, two tailed paired Student's t tests were performed. For binding experiments, curves were analyzed by fitting a logistic curve (Graph Pad software). Multiple statistical comparisons were performing using analysis of variance multivariable linear model or Mann-Whitney t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSLMWF Enhances EC Tube Formation—An important aspect of angiogenesis is the formation of ECs into functional capillaries. To study the effect of LMWF on this process in vitro, wells containing growth factor-reduced Matrigel were used in a tube-forming assay. HUVEC were observed 18 h after seeding and analyzed for the quality and number of the tubes formed in the gel with either full EC medium, 1% FCS, or 1% FCS+20 ng/ml VEGF165 (Fig. 1). Overall, conditions in EC medium had a high level of tube formation. The highest quality networks of tubes formed in EC medium with 10 μg/ml LMWF (score = 4.8 ± 0.5; Fig. 1C; p < 0.01). Low serum content (1% FCS) by itself induced a very low level of tube formation (score = 0.8 ± 0.5; Fig. 1E). The presence of 1 μg/ml LMWF in 1% FCS significantly (p < 0.05) increased the amount of tube formation. Addition of 10 μg/ml LMWF in 1% FCS significantly (p < 0.01) increased the amount of tube formation (score = 2.8 ± 0.5; Fig. 1G) reaching values obtained with fully supplemented commercial EC medium. The highest concentration (100 μg/ml) of LMWF in 1% FCS had a negative effect on tube formation (score = 0.3 ± 0.5; Fig. 1H). Addition of 20 ng/ml VEGF165 in 1% FCS increased tube formation. The presence of 1 μg/ml or 10 μg/ml LMWF in this medium significantly (p < 0.05) increased the amount of tube formation (Fig. 1M). Again, the highest LMWF concentration (100 μg/ml) had an inhibitory effect on tube formation (Fig. 1M).LMWF Has No Effect on HUVEC Proliferation Stimulated by VEGF165—Given the ability of LMWF to influence tube forming of HUVEC, it is also possible that this polysaccharide could influence other processes important to the progression of angiogenesis such as cellular proliferation. To test the ability of LMWF to influence HUVEC proliferation, we performed cell growth experiments for 48 h in commercial full EC medium, or in 5% FCS supplemented with FGF-2 or VEGF165. The presence of 10 μg/ml LMWF increased proliferation of HUVEC when added to EC medium, 5% FCS or FGF-2. EC medium gave the highest cell number when combined with LMWF (7.7 ± 0.43 × 104 cells/well versus 6.3 ± 0.18 × 104 cells/well; p < 0.001). The lowest amount of proliferation occurred in 5% FCS alone (net cell number of 1.0 ± 0.45 × 104 cells/well). Addition of 10 μg/ml LMWF in 5% FCS increased the net cell number to 2.9 ± 0.25 × 104 cells/well. FGF-2 produced a net cell number of 2.1 ± 0.21 × 104 cells/well, that was increased (4.9 ± 0.64 × 104 cells/well) when FGF-2 was combined with 10 μg/ml LMWF (p < 0.001). In contrast, LMWF did not influence the VEGF165 effect on HUVEC proliferation: VEGF165 produced a net cell number of 2.0 ± 0.4 × 104 cells/well and addition of 10 μg/ml LMWF had no significant effect on cell number (2.1 ± 0.33 × 104 cells/well).LMWF Increases VEGF165-induced EC Migration—High molecular weight fucoidan has been shown previously to enhance motility of HUVEC induced by FGF-1 and FGF-2 (21Giraux J.L. Matou S. Bros A. Tapon-Bretaudiere J. Letourneur D. Fischer A.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To examine the ability of LMWF to influence EC migration in response to VEGF165, transwell assays were employed with HUVEC allowed to migrate through fibronectin-coated 3-μm filters for 20 h. VEGF165 induced chemotaxis of HUVEC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, top panel, first row). As compared with the baseline value of migration (3.4 cells/field), the amount of cell migration induced by VEGF165 concentrations of 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 ng/ml were 5.4, 6.1, 10.8, 22.3, and 26.3 cells/field, respectively (Fig. 2). Over the range of VEGF165 from 0-30 ng/ml, significant increases in HUVEC migration were observed upon addition of 10 μg/ml LMWF when compared with VEGF165 alone (Fig. 2). The enhancing effect of LMWF was pronounced for 3 ng/ml and maximal for 10 ng/ml VEGF165 (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2LMWF enhances VEGF165-induced HUVEC migration. Representative photographs of stained filters from the transwell migration assay (top panel). Previously starved HUVECs were seeded into the upper chambers of a 3-μm filter, fibronectin-coated, transwell plate, and allowed to migrate for 20 h in response to the indicated concentrations of VEGF165 in 0.1% FCS with or without 10 μg/ml LMWF. Cells remaining in the upper chamber were removed and the migrated cells were visualized by staining with cresyl violet. The first row contained no LMWF, while the second row contained 10 μg/ml LMWF. Bottom panel, HUVEC on the filters were counted under a light microscope with an eyepiece grid to visualize set fields. Data are represented as average cells/field. Values are means ± S.D. for each condition in duplicate wells counted in quadruplicate fields.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To find the optimum concentration of LMWF increasing VEGF165-induced migration, a range of LMWF concentrations in the presence or absence of 3 ng/ml VEGF165 was tested for the ability to induce HUVEC migration in the transwell assay (Fig. 3). The largest increase in migration induced by VEGF165 was found for 10 μg/ml LMWF. At this concentration, migration was increased 3.1-fold (increase from 11.5 to 35.4 cells/field). Slightly lesser increases were observed for 3 and 30 μg/ml LMWF with values of 27.8 and 27.4 cells/field counted respectively (2.4-fold increase for both). When the highest concentration of LMWF (100 μg/ml) was added to VEGF165, a slight inhibitory effect was observed (decrease to 8.9 from 11.5 cells/field).FIGURE 3Optimization of LMWF concentration on HUVEC migration. Starved HUVECs were seeded into the upper chambers of a 3-μm filter, fibronectin coated, transwell plate and allowed to migrate for 20 h in response to various concentrations of LMWF in 0.1% FCS with or without 3 ng/ml VEGF165. LMWF concentrations tested ranged from 0-100 μg/ml. Cells remaining in the upper chamber were removed and the migrated cells on the bottom side of the filters were visualized by staining with cresyl violet and counted under a light microscope. Data are represented as average cells/field, and values are means ± S.D. for each condition in duplicate wells counted in quadruplicate fields.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Migration Enhancing Effect Was Optimal with LMWF—To determine if the VEGF165-induced migration enhancing effect shown above is specific to LMWF or shared with other sulfated polysaccharides, unfractionated fucoidan, LMW heparin, unfractionated heparin, LMW-sulfated dextran and chondroitin sulfate were tested for the ability to influence chemotaxis induced by 10 ng/ml VEGF165 (Fig. 4). Cell migration induced by VEGF165 alone was 4-fold increased as compared with the absence of VEGF165. Among the sulfated polysaccharides tested with VEGF165, LMWF had the most potent migration enhancing effect (3.2-fold increase over VEGF165; p < 0.001) followed by unfractionated fucoidan (2.7-fold increase over VEGF165; p < 0.001). Unfractionated heparin (1.7-fold increase over VEGF165), LMW-sulfated dextran (1.5-fold increase over VEGF165) and LMW heparin (1.3-fold increase over VEGF165) had lower migration enhancing effects. Chondroitin sulfate had no significant effect on HUVEC migration through the transwell (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Migration enhancing effect is maximal with LMWF. Starved HUVECs were seeded into the upper chambers of a 3 μm filter, fibronectin coated, transwell plate and allowed to migrate for 20 h in response to various polysaccharides (10 μg/ml) in 0.1% FCS with or without addition of 10 ng/ml of VEGF165. Cells remaining in the upper chamber were removed and the migrated cells visualized by staining with cresyl violet on the bottom side of the filters were counted. Data are represented as average cells/field and values are means ± S.D. for each condition in duplicate wells counted in quadruplicate fields. *, p < 0.01 as compared with no addition; **, p < 0.001 as compared with no addition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LMWF Migration Enhancing Effect Was Specific to VEGF165— VEGF165 is known to bind heparin (26Ferrara N.

https://openalex.org/W2056528668,"TFII-I is a transcription factor and a target of phosphorylation by Bruton's tyrosine kinase. In humans, deletions spanning the TFII-I locus are associated with a cognitive defect, the Williams-Beuren cognitive profile. We report an unanticipated role of TFII-I outside the nucleus as a negative regulator of agonist-induced calcium entry (ACE) that suppresses surface accumulation of TRPC3 (transient receptor potential C3) channels. Inhibition of ACE by TFII-I requires phosphotyrosine residues that engage the SH2 (Src-homology 2) domains of phospholipase C–g (PLC-g) and an interrupted, pleckstrin homology (PH)–like domain that binds the split PH domain of PLC-g. Our observations suggest a model in which TFII-I suppresses ACE by competing with TRPC3 for binding to PLC-g."

Ubiquitination of target proteins is catalyzed by a cascade of at least three classes of enzymes, known as E1 2The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HECT, homologous to E6AP C terminus; C-S, C745S (mutant); Ub, ubiquitin; AA, any amino acid; DUB, deubiquitinating enzyme; CFW, calcofluor white; UBP, ubiquitin specific protease; ADCB, l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; YPD, yeast extract peptone dextrose. (ubiquitin-activating enzymes), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), and E3 (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases) (1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). There are two main classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases, known as HECT and RING E3s. HECT E3s participate directly in the chemistry of ubiquitin conjugation by forming a covalent thioester intermediate with ubiquitin at an active site cysteine residue within the HECT domain (2Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), whereas RING E3s appear to function as docking surfaces for activated E2s and substrates. Rsp5 is the best-characterized HECT E3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and direct homologs of Rsp5 (the Nedd4 family of HECT E3s) exist in all animals (3Ingham R.J. Gish G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1972-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). RSP5 is the only essential gene among the five HECT E3s in budding yeast (4Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the minimal essential function of Rsp5 is the ubiquitination of the Spt23 transcription factor, leading to a proteasome-catalyzed processing event that is required for its activation (5Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Rsp5 has been reported to function in a variety of other cellular processes including ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins such as Gap1 (6Galan J. Haguenauer-Tasapsis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), Fur4 (7Soetens O. De Craene J.O. Andre B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25974-25981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the delivery of biosynthetic cargo such as Cps1 into the endosomal lumen (9Katzmann D.J. Sarkar S. Chu T. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 468-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Rsp5 has also been implicated in RNA export (10Neumann S. Petfalski E. Brugger B. Grosshans H. Wieland F. Tollervey D. Hurt E. EMBO Rep. 2003; 12: 1156-1162Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), ubiquitination of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (11Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), mitochondrial inheritance (12Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and cell wall biogenesis (13Kaminska J. Kwapisz M. Grabinsk A.K. Orlowski J. Boguta M. Palamarczyk G. Zoladek T. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2005; 52: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), indicating that Rsp5 is a multifunctional protein capable of ubiquitinating many substrates in many different locations. Ubiquitination is a reversible process in that the isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and a substrate protein, as well as isopeptide bonds between ubiquitin molecules in a polyubiquitin chain, can be cleaved by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). There are at least 18 DUBs characterized in S. cerevisiae to date, including 16 ubiquitin specific proteases (UBPs), an ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, and a JAMM (JAB1/MPN1/Mov34 metalloenzyme) motif metalloprotease. The best-characterized function of DUBs is to facilitate the rescue of ubiquitin monomers from proteolytic degradation. For example, Doa4/Ubp4 is an endosomal membrane-associated protease that cleaves ubiquitin molecules from endocytic cargo prior to vacuolar degradation, thus maintaining total cellular ubiquitin pools (14Amerik A.Y. Nowak J. Swaminathan S. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3365-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 15Dupre S. Haguenauer-Tasapsis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4482-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and Ubp6 is a proteosome-associated enzyme that is required for ubiquitin homeostasis and thought to rescue ubiquitin molecules prior to proteosomal degradation of substrates (16Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Other roles of the DUBs include processing of ubiquitin precursors to mature forms and reversing ubiquitination of substrates (17Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). There have been several reports of E3s that are physically associated with DUBs (18Wu X. Yen L. Irwin L. Sweeney C. Carraway K.L. II I Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7748-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Hetfeld B. Helfrich A. Kapelari B. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Guterman A. Glickman M. Schade R. Kloetzel P. Dubiel W. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1217-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and in these cases the DUBs reverse autoubiquitination of the E3s, thus increasing the stability of the E3 by protecting them from proteosomal degradation. Recently, Rsp5 has been shown to be physically associated with Ubp2 (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Autoubiquitination of Rsp5 in vivo has not been previously reported, and the half-life of Rsp5 is unaffected by its catalytic activity, suggesting that Ubp2 does not regulate the stability of Rsp5. Rather, genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that Ubp2 antagonizes Rsp5-mediated ubiquitination of target proteins (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The interaction of Rsp5 and Ubp2 is indirect and is mediated by a third protein, Rup1. Rup1 contains ubiquitin-associated domain and no other characterized functional domains or motifs. Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues that can potentially serve as acceptor sites for additional ubiquitin molecules to form polyubiquitin chains. Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains are the primary signals for targeting to the 26 S proteasome, whereas monoubiquitination and some other forms of polyubiquitin chains appear to mediate alternative functions (22Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 24Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Lys63-linked chains serve non-proteolytic functions in DNA repair pathways (25Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 7Soetens O. De Craene J.O. Andre B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43949-43957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), although they may also be capable of proteasome targeting (29Saeki Y. Isono E. Toh-E A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Lys6-linked chains have been implicated in a DNA repair pathway (31Wu-Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34743-34756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We showed previously that Rsp5 preferentially catalyzes Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of substrates in vitro, whereas Ubp2 preferentially disassembles Lys63 chains in vitro (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here we show that Rsp5 and Ubp2 modulate Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in vivo, and the essential function of Rsp5 at elevated temperature requires Lys63 polyubiquitination and identify two new targets of Rsp5 and Ubp2 that are subject to Lys63 ubiquitination. Yeast Strains, Media, and Plasmids—A list of yeast strains is shown in Table 1. SUB492 and SUB493 strains express wild type and K63R ubiquitin as a sole source of ubiquitin, respectively, as previously described (25Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see Table 1). ubp2Δ mutations were introduced into both SUB492 and SUB493 strains using kanamycin selection, as described previously (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), generating YK018 and YK019, respectively. csr2Δ and ecm21Δ mutations were introduced into FW1808 strain using the same method to generate YK028 and YK029, respectively. The rup1Δ mutation was introduced into YK009 strain using HIS3 selection, generating YK030. pUB39 is a Lys2-marked plasmid that expresses wild type ubiquitin under the CUP1 promoter. pUB115, pUB192, pUB195, and pUB197 are identical to pUB39, except for the K48R, K6R, K29R, and K63R mutations, respectively (25Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids for overexpressing UBP2 and ubp2C745S were described previously (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CSR2 and ECM21 open reading frames were PCR amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) encoding an N-terminal hemagglutinin epitope for in vitro and in vivo expression. For the expression of N-terminally tandem affinity purification-tagged ubiquitin, the UBI4 open reading frame is subcloned into the pYES2-NTAP vector (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The C-terminal codons of UBI4 encoding GG altered to AA codons for expression of NTAP-Ub-AA75–76. For the ADCB-containing medium, ADCB (Sigma) was dissolved in water and added to synthetic minimal medium as final concentrations of 100 or 200 μg/ml where indicated. For the calcofluor white (CFW)-containing medium, CFW (Sigma) was dissolved in water and added to yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium as final concentrations of 5 or 7 μg/ml where indicated.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReferenceFY56MATα his4-912 δR5 lys2-128Δ ura3-52Huibregtse et al.

Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For the pull down of ubiquitin conjugates from the cell extracts, cells in mid-log phase were lysed with a bead beater in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors. Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min before they were subjected to GST-Rsp5 or GST-Ubp2-C-S-Sepharose. The binding reactions were left for 2 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed with the Nonidet P-40 buffer for three times before SDS-PAGE. 35S-Labeled Csr2 and Ecm21 were produced using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega) for in vitro GST pull-down assays. The translated products were bound to GST-Rsp5 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 4°C before they were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Purification of Ubiquitinated Proteins—For the large scale purification of ubiquitinated proteins, 6 liters of ubp2Δ cells containing the N-terminally TAP-tagged ubiquitin were grown, and the expression of tagged ubiquitin was induced by switching the cells to galactose medium overnight. Cell lysate was prepared as described above. IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the cleared lysate and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed two times with the Nonidet P-40 buffer, and the final wash was done with TEV buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol) before adding TEV protease to the beads. The TEV cleavage reaction was done for 2 h at room temperature on a rotator. The eluted ubiquitinated proteins were purified on GST-Rsp5C777A immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. Sepharose was washed two times with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer followed by 0.1% Nonidet P-40 buffer as a final wash before they were analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue. Bands were excised from a Coomassie Blue stained gel and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. The fragmented peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In Vitro Ubiquitination/Deubiquitination Assays—In vitro ubiquitination and deubiquitination assays were performed in the presence of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma). Bacterially expressed Rsp5, Rup1, and Ubp2 were purified on glutathione-Sepharose, and GST was removed by cleavage with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of baculovirus-expressed human E1 and UbcHis7 were performed as described previously (32Salvat C. Wang G. Dastur A. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18935-18943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In vitro translated 35S-labeled Csr2 or Ecm21, synthesized using rabbit reticulocyte lysate, were used as substrates. The ubiquitination reactions were performed as described previously (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination reactions were carried out for 30 min at room temperature followed by an additional 30 min for deubiquitination by Rup1/Ubp2. For the assays using Lys0, Lys48-only, and Lys63-only ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), the in vitro translated substrates were partially purified by DEAE anion exchange column to remove endogenous ubiquitin. The reactions were performed as describe above and stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the samples were analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Modulation of Lys63 Polyubiquitin Conjugates by Rsp5 and Ubp2—We previously reported that Ubp2 preferentially disassembles Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains relative to Lys48-linked chains in vitro (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To further analyze Ubp2 activity in vivo, we compared the amount of overall ubiquitin conjugates in total cell extracts from wild type UBP2 and ubp2Δ cells. A strong increase in total ubiquitin conjugates was seen in ubp2Δ cells, as determined by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 1A). Reintroduction of a plasmid-based UBP2 gene under GAL1 promoter control reduced the conjugate level below that seen in the wild type UBP2 strain, whereas reintroduction of the active site cysteine-to-serine ubp2 mutant (C745S, C-S) did not suppress conjugate accumulation (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the increased ubiquitin conjugates in the ubp2Δ cells represented an accumulation of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, we took advantage of strains in which all four endogenous ubiquitin genes were eliminated and replaced by a plasmid-borne wild type ubiquitin gene or a mutated ubiquitin gene encoding K63R ubiquitin (25Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ubp2Δ mutation was introduced into both of these strains. As expected, the ubp2Δ mutation led to an increase in ubiquitin conjugates in the strain expressing wild type ubiquitin (Fig. 1C), whereas the ubp2Δ mutation in the K63R strain resulted in only a slight accumulation of conjugates, suggesting that the vast majority of the elevated ubiquitin conjugates in the ubp2Δ mutant represented Lys63-linked chains. The small but consistently increased level of ubiquitin conjugates observed in the ubp2Δ/K63R strain suggests that Ubp2 may have a limited capacity to recognize ubiquitin linkages other than Lys63. The ubp2Δ mutation conferred increased sensitivity to the toxic proline analogue l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid 3R. Piper and J. Huibregtse, manuscript in preparation. (ADCB; Fig. 2A), suggesting that hyper-Lys63 polyubiquitination of one or more proteins led to ADCB hypersensitivity. Consistent with this, the ubp2Δ mutant did not display increased ADCB sensitivity in cells that expressed K63R-ubiquitin as the sole source of ubiquitin (Fig. 2A, upper left panel). Even in a wild type UBP2 background, cells expressing K63R ubiquitin as the sole source of the ubiquitin were resistant to ADCB compared with the wild type ubiquitin strain, further indicating that Lys63-linked polyubiquitination was required to confer sensitivity to ADCB (Fig. 2A, lower left panel). GAL1 promoter-driven expression of UBP2 in the ubp2Δ mutant conferred ADCB resistance beyond that of wild type UBP2 cells, whereas overexpression of the C-S mutant did not suppress ADCB sensitivity (Fig. 2B). Together, the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that the ubp2Δ mutation leads to an overall accumulation of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin conjugates in vivo. To determine whether the conjugates that accumulate are the result of Rsp5 ubiquitination activity, we analyzed the effect of the rsp5-1 hypomorphic temperature-sensitive mutation on the accumulation of conjugates. A strong reduction in overall conjugates was observed in the rsp5-1/ubp2Δ mutant compared with RSP5/ubp2Δ cells (Fig. 3A), both at normal and elevated growth temperatures. This result strongly suggests that the majority of ubiquitin conjugates that accumulate in the ubp2Δ strain are the result of Rsp5-dependent ubiquitin conjugation, consistent with our previous demonstration that Rsp5 preferentially catalyzes conjugation of Lys63-linked chains in vitro (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that Rsp5 catalyzes Lys63 chain formation in vivo, wild type ubiquitin, K63R ubiquitin, or K48R ubiquitin was overexpressed in the rsp5-1 mutant (Fig. 3B, top). Overexpression of wild type ubiquitin rescued the growth defect of the rsp5-1 mutant at elevated temperature, as reported previously (33Krsmanovic T. Kolling R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Overexpression of K48R ubiquitin also rescued growth, whereas overexpression of K63R ubiquitin did not. K6R ubiquitin also rescued rsp5-1 temperature sensitivity, whereas rescue by K29R ubiquitin was partial compared with wild type ubiquitin (not shown). Overexpression of K63R ubiquitin had no effect on the growth of wild type RSP5 cells (not shown). These results demonstrate that the ability of Rsp5 to form Lys63-linked conjugates is linked to its essential function at elevated temperature, although they do not rule out that Rsp5 might synthesize other types of polyubiquitin chains in vivo, particularly Lys29-linked chains. Physical Association of Lys63-conjugated Proteins with Rsp5 and Ubp2—Rsp5 has been shown to interact directly with several of its substrates, generally mediated by the WW domains of Rsp5 and proline-containing motifs in the substrate proteins (4Wang G. Yang J. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because the Lys63 conjugates that accumulate in the ubp2Δ mutant are the result of Rsp5 ubiquitination activity, we predicted that a significant fraction of the conjugates in extract from ubp2Δ cells might stably interact with purified GST-Rsp5 in vitro. To test this, extracts were made from UBP2 wild type cells, ubp2Δ, ubp3Δ, and ubp4Δ mutant cells. Although ubp3Δ and ubp4Δ cells also accumulated ubiquitin conjugates (Fig. 4A), there was no known relationship between Rsp5 and either Ubp3 or Ubp4, and we therefore did not expect ubiquitinated proteins in these extracts to interact with GST-Rsp5. As shown in Fig. 4A, GST-Rsp5 bound a large fraction of the input conjugates from the ubp2Δ cell extract, but not from any of the control extracts. This further substantiates that the conjugates that accumulated in the ubp2Δ mutant were likely to be a direct result of Rsp5-catalyzed ubiquitination. Interestingly, GST-Ubp2 also bound to a significant fraction of conjugates in the extract from ubp2Δ cells (Fig. 4, B and C), whereas GST-Ubp6 or GST-E6AP (a human HECT E3) did not (Fig. 4C). Because GST-Ubp2 can bind to Rup1 and Rsp5 that are present in cell extract (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it is possible that the binding of GST-Ubp2 to conjugates was indirect and through Rup1 and Rsp5. This appears likely because association of the conjugates with GST-Ubp2 significantly decreased in the ubp2Δ/rup1Δ mutant (Fig. 4B). However, a fraction of the conjugates was still bound in the absence of Rup1, suggesting that Ubp2 may be able to recognize some of its targets directly. This is consistent with the fact that Ubp2 can deubiquitinate Rsp5 substrates in vitro in the absence of Rup1, albeit with reduced efficiency (21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Rsp5 and Ubp2 Regulate Cell Wall Homeostasis—The temperature sensitivity of rsp5 mutants can be partially rescued by sorbitol, an osmotic stabilizer (34Ysashiroda H. Oguchi T. Yasuda Y. Akio T.E. Kikuchi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3255-3263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kee Y. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and a recent report also indicated that Rsp5 affects cell wall integrity (13Kaminska J. Kwapisz M. Grabinsk A.K. Orlowski J. Boguta M. Palamarczyk G. Zoladek T. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2005; 52: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). An assay that reflects the effect of rsp5 mutations on cell wall integrity is sensitivity to CFW, a chitin-binding molecule. As shown in Fig. 5A, the rsp5-1 mutant was sensitive to CFW at 30° C. According to the model that Rup1 and Ubp2 functionally antagonize Rsp5, we predicted that ubp2 or rup1 mutations would lead to increased Rsp5 activity and therefore rescue CFW sensitivity of the rsp5-1 mutant. This was the case (Fig. 5A) indicating that Rup1/Ubp2 activity and Rsp5 activities are balanced, in part, to achieve cell wall homeostasis. As with the ADCB sensitivity, CFW sensitivity of the rsp5-1 strain was also linked to the formation of Lys63-polyubiquitin conjugates. Overexpression of wild type ubiquitin suppressed the CFW sensitivity, whereas overexpression of K63R ubiquitin did not and in fact led to increased CFW sensitivity (Fig. 5B). The K63R-only ubiquitin strain (K63R ubiquitin as the sole source of ubiquitin) itself was also hypersensitive to CFW compared with the equivalent wild type ubiquitin strain (Fig. 5C), further indicating that formation of Lys63-polyubiquitin conjugates by Rsp5 was required for cell wall biogenesis and/or integrity. Identification of Two Substrates Regulated by Rsp5 and Ubp2—It is not known whether all targets of Rsp5, or only a subset, are subject to potential regulation by Ubp2. The results shown in Fig. 4 suggested that we could identify the Ubp2-responsive substrates of Rsp5 by mass spectrometry-based identification of the proteins in the GST-Rsp5 pulldown from ubp2Δ cell extract. For this purpose, we expressed amino-terminally TAP-tagged ubiquitin in ubp2Δ cells (35Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Total TAP-ubiquitin conjugates were isolated on IgG-Sepharose, and the conjugates were released from IgG-Sepharose by cleavage of the TAP tag with TEV protease. The TAP-tagged ubiquitin formed conjugates in ubp2Δ cells, and the TAP-tagged ubiquitin conjugates could be efficiently purified on IgG-Sepharose (supplemental data). To exclude the possibility that TAP-ubiquitin was merely serving as an acceptor for endogenous ubiquitin, thereby forming free polyubiquitin conjugates, TAP-ubiquitin was expressed in which the terminal diglycine residues were altered to alanine residues (TAP-Ub-AA75–76). No significant accumulation or purification of ubiquitin conjugates was detected with the AA75–76 mutant, indicating that the wild type TAP-ubiquitin was indeed being conjugated to target proteins (supplemental data). The purification was scaled up and IgG-purified"

We have hypothesized that each of the five ACSL isoforms partitions FA toward specific downstream pathways. Acsl1 mRNA is increased in cells under both lipogenic and oxidative conditions. To elucidate the role of ACSL1 in hepatic lipid metabolism, we overexpressed an Acsl1 adenovirus construct (Ad-Acsl1) in rat primary hepatocytes. Ad-ACSL1, located on the endoplasmic reticulum but not on mitochondria or plasma membrane, increased ACS specific activity 3.7-fold. With 100 or 750 μm [1-14C]oleate, Ad-Acsl1 increased oleate incorporation into diacylglycerol and phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, and decreased incorporation into cholesterol esters and secreted triacylglycerol. Ad-Acsl1 did not alter oleate incorporation into triacylglycerol, β-oxidation products, or total amount of FA metabolized. In pulse-chase experiments to examine the effects of Ad-Acsl1 on lipid turnover, more labeled triacylglycerol and phospholipid, but less labeled diacylglycerol, remained in Ad-Acsl1 cells, suggesting that ACSL1 increased reacylation of hydrolyzed oleate derived from triacylglycerol and diacylglycerol. In addition, less hydrolyzed oleate was used for cholesterol ester synthesis and β-oxidation. The increase in [1,2,3-3H]glycerol incorporation into diacylglycerol and phospholipid was similar to the increase with [14C]oleate labeling suggesting that ACSL1 increased de novo synthesis. Labeling Ad-Acsl1 cells with [14C]acetate increased triacylglycerol synthesis but did not channel endogenous FA away from cholesterol ester synthesis. Thus, consistent with the hypothesis that individual ACSLs partition FA, Ad-Acsl1 increased FA reacylation and channeled FA toward diacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis and away from cholesterol ester synthesis.

Acyl-CoAs enter both anabolic and catabolic pathways (1Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and the disturbance of these pathways is linked to disorders such as hepatic steatosis, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Five ACSL isoforms, each the product of a separate gene, have been cloned and characterized in mammals (2Mashek D.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Coleman R.A. Berger J. Bernlohr D.A. Black P. DiRusso C.C. Farber S.A. Guo W. Hashimoto N. Khodiyar V. Kuypers F.A. Maltais L.J. Nebert D.W. Renieri A. Schaffer J.E. Stahl A. Watkins P.A. Vasiliou V. Yamamoto T.T. J.

Signpost. 2002; 37: 1-15Google Scholar). Even though individual ACSL isoforms have different substrate preferences, enzyme kinetics, and cellular and subcellular locations, and are regulated uniquely (4Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Gonzalez-Baro M.R. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 6Van Horn C.G. Caviglia J.M. Li L.O. Wang S. Granger D.A. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the significance of this diversity is unknown. We hypothesized that, instead of being redundant, individual ACSL isoforms might channel FA into distinct metabolic pathways.Evidence for the importance of ACSL in FA channeling comes from studies with triacsin C, an inhibitor of recombinant ACSL1, -3, and -4, but not ACSL5 or -6 (5Kim J.H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 6Van Horn C.G. Caviglia J.M. Li L.O. Wang S. Granger D.A. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For example, in hepatocytes, in which Acsl1, -3, -4, and -5 are abundant (7Mashek D.G. Li L.O. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2004-2010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), triacsin C inhibits TAG synthesis 70% but inhibits oleate incorporation into phospholipids and β-oxidation only 34% (8Muoio D.M. Lewin T.M. Wiedmer P. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E1366-E1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More direct evidence comes from studies that overexpress individual ACSL isoforms. In ACSL1 heart-specific transgenic mice, TAG and PL accumulate in heart muscle in the absence of changes in CE or β-oxidation (9Chiu H.C. Kovacs A. Ford D.A. Hsu F.F. Garcia R. Herrero P. Saffitz J.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), and when ACSL5 is overexpressed in rat hepatoma McArdle-RH777 cells, it partitions exogenously derived FA toward TAG synthesis and storage, but not toward PL or CE synthesis (10Mashek D.G. McKenzie M.A. Van Horn C.G. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 945-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the exact function of other ACSL isoforms in liver remains largely unexplored, in part because we lack inhibitors that can exclusively inhibit one isoform without affecting others.Although studies suggest that ACSL1 is important for TAG synthesis in adipocytes and fibroblasts (4Coleman R.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), conflicting data exist concerning the function of ACSL1 in liver. Supporting a role for ACSL1 in TAG synthesis is its location in the ER and MAM, which are sites of TAG synthesis, and its absence from mitochondria, the major site of FA β-oxidation (12Lewin T.M.

Further, Acsl1 mRNA is induced when previously fasted rats are refed with a high fat or high sucrose diet that favors lipogenesis (13Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kondo J. Abe T. Nishikawa K. Kimura S.

On the other hand, in support of a role for ACSL1 in providing FA for β-oxidation are data showing that PPARα agonists, which up-regulate genes for both FA β-oxidation and de novo FA synthesis (17Knight B.L.

We hypothesized that ACSL1 would channel FA toward some specific lipid metabolic pathways and away from others.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—DNA restriction endonucleases and ligase for recombinant adenovirus construction were from New England Biolabs. Human embryonic kidney 293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. MEM, nonessential amino acids, FBS, and tissue culture dishes were from Invitrogen. Rat-tail collagen I was from Collaborative Biomedical Products. Silica gel G plates were from Whatman (cat. No. 4865-821). [1-14C]Acetate, [1,2,3-3H]glycerol, and [1-14C]oleate were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [14C]palmitate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Lipid standards were from Sigma and Avanti Polar Lipids. Polyacrylamide stock was from National Diagnostics. Lab-Tek™ II Chamber Slides™ were from Nunc. RNeasy kit was from Qiagen. Chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated.Construction of pACCMV-Acsl1FLAG Adenovirus—A fulllength rat Acsl1 cDNA with a C-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was subcloned from a previously constructed pFLAG-CTC plasmid (5Kim J.H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) into a shuttle vector, pACCMVpLpA at the BamHI and SalI sites. Expression of the inserted Acsl1FLAG cDNA is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The inserted ACSL1FLAG in the pACCMV-Acsl1FLAG construct was verified by restriction enzyme analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing at the University of North Carolina (UNC) DNA sequencing facility. Expression and activity of the pACCMV-Acsl1FLAG construct were confirmed by transient transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells for 24 h, followed by ACS activity assay and anti-FLAG Western blot. The pACCMV-Acsl1FLAG construct was co-transfected with an adenoviral DNA, pJM17, into human embryonic kidney 293 cells for homologous recombination to form recombinant adenovirus carrying Acsl1FLAG cDNA (Ad-Acsl1) (21Becker T.C.

After plaque purification, virions were further purified and amplified by the UNC Vector Core Facility. A virus containing a GFP gene under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Ad-GFP) was used for control infections (10Mashek D.G. McKenzie M.A. Van Horn C.G. Coleman R.A. J. Biol.

Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were housed in a 12:12-h light-dark cycle and were allowed free access to food (Prolab® Rat/Mouse/Hamster 3000 diet, Labdiet) before hepatocyte isolation. Primary hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion by the UNC Cellular Metabolism and Transport Core. Cell viability, determined by trypan blue exclusion, exceeded 90%. Hepatocytes were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per 60 mm or 4.5 × 106 cells per 100-mm collagen-coated dish in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS (v/v), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (22Lewin T.M. Wang S. Nagle C.A. Van Horn C.G. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 288: E835-E844Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After cells attached (4-5 h), recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-GFP or Ad-Acsl1) were added for 2 h at 37 °C in serum-free MEM. Infection medium was removed and replaced by MEM containing 10% FBS, 10 nm dexamethasone, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acid (MEM-DA).For dose-dependent expression, hepatocytes were infected with Ad-Acsl1 at m.o.i. values of 5, 10, 20, or 50 for 2 h. Uninfected cells or Ad-GFP-infected cells (20 m.o.i.) served as controls. After 18 h, cells were washed with cold PBS, and homogenates were collected as described below. For the time course, hepatocytes were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-Acsl1atan m.o.i. of 20. Homogenates were collected after 12, 18, 24, 26, or 36 h of incubation for Ad-Acsl1-infected cells and after 18 h of incubation for Ad-GFP-infected cells.Cell Labeling and Lipid Extraction and Analysis—Twentyone h after adenoviral infection (Ad-GFP or Ad-Acsl1) at 20 m.o.i., hepatocytes (1.5 × 106 cells in 60-mm dishes) were labeled with 3 ml of MEM containing 1.0 μCi of [1-14C]oleate bound to bovine serum albumin (essentially FA free) in a 3:1 molar ratio for 3 h (10Mashek D.G.

Although ACS activity with oleate was ∼20% lower than that with palmitate in both GFP and Acsl1 adenovirus-infected cells (data not shown), oleate was used for labeling to avoid lipotoxicity (23Cacicedo J.M.

In some experiments cells were incubated with 250 μm [1,2,3-3H]glycerol (1.1 μCi) or 2.5 mm [1-14C]acetate (1.0 μCi). The medium was collected for ASM measurement or extracted to measure radiolabel incorporation into secreted lipids (10Mashek D.G. McKenzie M.A. Van Horn C.G. Coleman R.A. J. Biol.

Dyer W.J. Can J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, hepatocytes were infected with adenovirus for 21 h (as above) and incubated with 750 μm [1-14C]oleate in the presence of 250 μm unlabeled glycerol, or with 250 μm [1,2,3-3H]glycerol in the presence of 750 μm unlabeled oleate. After a 3-h incubation, the cells were either collected (pulse) as described above, or washed twice with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and then incubated for an additional 14 h in MEM-DA without added oleate or glycerol (chase). The medium and cells were collected, and lipids were extracted as described.Aliquots of the lipid extracts from the cells and media were separated by TLC on 0.25-mm silica gel G plates in either hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v) for neutral lipids (10Mashek D.G.

The 14C- or 3H-labeled lipids were detected and quantified with a Bioscan 200 Image System.Cell Homogenate Preparations for ACS Activity and ACSL Protein Assays—Hepatocytes infected with Ad-Acsl1 or Ad-GFP were washed twice with cold PBS and collected in cold Medium A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1mm dithiothreitol, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma)) and homogenized on ice with 10 up-and-down strokes with a Teflon-glass motor-driven homogenizer. Homogenate aliquots were stored at -80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). ACS specific activity was determined by measuring the production of [14C]acyl-CoA in the presence of 175 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 0.25 mm CoA, and 50 μm [14C]palmitic acid in 0.5 mm Triton X-100, 0.01 mm EDTA. The assays were performed in a total volume of 200 μl at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was started by adding 0.5-1.5 μg of homogenate protein, terminated with 1 ml of Dole's reagent (isopropanol, heptane, 1 m H2SO4, 80:20:2, v/v), and extracted (27Polokoff M.A. Bell R.M.

Enzyme assays measured initial rates.Western Blot Analysis—Homogenates from the dose-dependent infection and time-course incubations (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel with 0.1% SDS and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive bands were detected by incubating the membranes with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G, and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Reagent (Pierce) (28Caviglia J.M.

Cells were then doubly labeled with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:400) and individual organelle markers (fluorescein isothiocyanate-concanavalin A (1:500, Miles-Yeda Ltd.) and anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (1:100, Abcam) for ER, anti-VDAC polyclonal antibody (1:100, ABR) for mitochondria, or rhodamine phalloidin (1:100, Molecular Probes) for actin fiber) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times and then incubated in blocking buffer containing Alexa Fluor® 488 or Alexa Fluor® 568 goat anti-mouse IgG-specific antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor® 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG-specific antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes) or cellular stains for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times for 5 min in PBS, mounting media (Biomedia) was added to the chambers on the detached glass slide and fitted with a no.1 cover glass before being sealed and imaged. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss 510 Meta Inverted Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope, and LSM 510 META software (Zeiss) for image acquisition.Cellular Free Cholesterol Measurement—Hepatocytes (4.5 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish) infected for 21 h with Ad-GFP or Ad-Acsl1 at m.o.i. 20 were incubated with oleate at 0, 100, or 750 μm for 3 h, followed by lipid extraction. Free cholesterol was determined using an enzymatic colorimetric assay (Free Cholesterol E, COD-DAOS, Wako).Statistical Analysis—Data from each group were expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed by Student's t test, and significance was declared at p < 0.05.RESULTSAdenoviral Overexpression of Acsl1 Increased ACS Activity in Rat Primary Hepatocytes—We infected rat primary hepatocytes with Ad-GFP or an adenovirus containing rat Acsl1 with a FLAG epitope at the C terminus (Ad-Acsl1) and measured the ACS specific activity with palmitate at different virus doses (Fig. 1A) and incubation times (Fig. 1B). After an 18-h infection with Ad-GFP, ACS specific activity did not change (167.8 ± 4.9 versus 155.0 ± 2.6 nmol/min/mg protein in uninfected cells). In contrast, Ad-Acsl1 (18 h) increased ACS specific activity 86-236% at 5-50 m.o.i., with a linear increase through 20 m.o.i. Ad-Acsl1 at 20 m.o.i. increased ACS specific activity linearly for 36 h. Western blotting with anti-FLAG primary antibody showed a band of ∼75 kDa, confirming that the increase in ACS specific activity was due to the overexpression of ACSL1. Consistent with the increase in activity, the density of the immunoreactive band increased with the time of incubation and the adenovirus dose. For labeling experiments, we chose 20 m.o.i. and 24 h when ACS specific activity was increased 3.7-fold. Acsl4or Acsl5 are two other major Acsl genes expressed in rat liver. Overexpressed Acsl1 increased Acsl5 mRNA expression 2-fold, but Acsl4 mRNA expression was not altered (data not shown).Overexpressed ACSL1 Co-localized with ER but Not Mitochondria or Plasma Membrane—Previous studies used subcellular fractionation to show that endogenous ACSL1 in rat liver is present in ER fractions and MAM fraction but not in purified mitochondrial fractions (8Muoio D.M.

FLAG antibody detection of ACSL1-FLAG strongly co-localized with the ER markers concanavalin A (Fig. 2A) and calnexin (Fig. 2B) but not with the mitochondrial membrane marker VDAC (Fig. 2C). Further, staining of actin fibers, which revealed cellular morphology, implied the absence of ACSL1 on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2D). We were unable to use an antiphosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase antibody to identify MAM in hepatocytes.FIGURE 2Ad-Acsl1 is an ER protein in primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes infected with Ad-Acsl1 for 18 h were fixed and labeled with primary antibodies against the FLAG epitope. Detection of ACSL1-FLAG was attained with either secondary anti-mouse IgG-specific Alexa-568 antibodies (A, red), or secondary anti-mouse IgG-specific Alexa-488 antibodies (B-D, green). A, Ad-Acsl1-infected cells were co-stained with FLAG antibodies (red) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated concanavalin A (green). Arrows in each panel and inset point to regions of intense co-localization on reticulated endomembranes; B, Ad-Acsl1-infected cells co-stained with FLAG antibodies (green) and the ER membrane protein calnexin (red). Arrows point to areas of intense co-localization (upper cell) and areas with less intensity that show co-localization near the cell periphery (central cell); C, co-staining for FLAG (green) and mitochondria marker VDAC (red) with arrows pointing to VDAC immunopositive structures devoid of Ad-Acsl1; D, co-staining with FLAG antibodies (green) and rhodamine-phalloidin (red) with an arrow pointing to an area on the cell surface that is devoid of Ad-Acsl1. Cells not stained with FLAG antibody are uninfected cells. Bar, 10 μm. Images are representative of experiments repeated at least three times. Cells were imaged by confocal microscopy as 0.5-μm slices with a 63× oil immersion objective at 2× magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ER marker concanavalin A labels lumen-oriented mannose sugars on proteins in ER and Golgi compartments. The polyclonal calnexin antibody labels epitopes on the luminal side of this ER resident protein. Calnexin co-distributed best with ACSL1-FLAG, possibly because both are integral ER proteins. Because ACSL1-FLAG did not co-distribute with equal intensity on ER membranes labeled with concanavalin A, we stained cells for other ER proteins. The chaperone-like luminal ER proteins protein disulfide isomerase and BiP also co-localized with ACSL1-FLAG but reflected staining patterns similar to concanavalin A (data not shown). The anti-rabbit Alexa-568 antibody (Fig. 2, B-D, red) was preferred for the detection of endogenous proteins due to lower background levels in secondary antibody controls (data not shown). These data provided evidence for exogenous ACSL1 localization to ER membranes. Thus, the subcellular location of overexpressed ACSL1 in primary hepatocytes was"

We demonstrated that one of these proteins, Myo1f, is expressed predominantly in the mammalian immune system. Cells from Myo1f-deficient mice exhibited abnormally increased adhesion and reduced motility, resulting from augmented exocytosis of β2 integrin–containing granules. Also, the cortical actin that co-localizes with Myo1f was reduced in Myo1f-deficient cells. In vivo, Myo1f-deficient mice showed increased susceptibility to infection by Listeria monocytogenes and an impaired neutrophil response. Thus, Myo1f directs immune cell motility and innate host defense against infection."

We report that the exocyst complex and its interacting GTPase RalA play a critical role in this polarized trafficking process.

Cytokinesis is a crucial process in which the cytoplasmic constituents of the mother cell are divided into two identical daughter cells, ensuring the fidelity of cell division. Cytokinesis proceeds via distinct steps, including assembly of the actomyosin contractile ring, formation of the ingressing cleavage furrow, and cell cleavage or abscission (1Glotzer M. Science. 2005; 307: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Membrane trafficking is important for all steps of cytokinesis and is directly required for sealing off the abscission site where cells undergo the final separation (2Strickland L.I. Burgess D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 115-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recycling endosome-derived vesicle trafficking plays an essential role in the terminal stages of cytokinesis, possibly under the control of the centrosome (3Albertson R. Riggs B. Sullivan W. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying this polarized delivery of vesicles from the recycling endosomes during abscission remain poorly understood.The exocyst is an evolutionarily conserved vesicle tethering complex, comprised by eight subunits including Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84 (4Lipschutz J.H. Mostov K.E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R212-R214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex has been proposed to mediate the initial recognition between the exocytic vesicles and the target membrane, thereby contributing to the specificity and efficiency of certain vesicular transport processes (5Dong G. Hutagalung A.H. Fu C. Novick P. Reinisch K.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recent insights into structure of the exocyst have shed light on the architecture and function of this complex, suggesting that the exocyst assembles into an overall rod-like structure, in the process bridging the vesicles to their target membrane (5Dong G. Hutagalung A.H. Fu C. Novick P. Reinisch K.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1094-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Sivaram M.V. Saporita J.A. Furgason M.L. Boettcher A.J. Munson M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6302-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, the exocyst has been found to concentrate on “hotspots” on the plasma membrane where exocytosis actively takes place and has been implicated in different types of membrane trafficking including polarized growth in yeast, neurite growth in the nervous system, glucose transport in fat cells, and basal-lateral trafficking in epithelial cells (4Lipschutz J.H. Mostov K.E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R212-R214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the exocyst complex localizes to the cleavage furrow and is essential for membrane delivery during cytokinesis (7Dobbelaere J. Barral Y. Science. 2004; 305: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 9Wang H. Tang X. Liu J. Trautmann S. Balasundaram D. McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the role of the exocyst in cytokinesis is poorly understood in mammalian cells, in which the exocyst has a more specialized yet complex function.Ral GTPases (RalA and RalB) have been the focus of special attention for their roles in regulating exocyst function in eukaryotic cells. Upon activation, Ral can bind two exocyst subunits, Sec5 and Exo84. RalA has higher affinity for these proteins than does RalB (10Shipitsin M. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5746-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms remain elusive, this unique interaction pattern may enable RalA to regulate the assembly of the exocyst during vesicle targeting as Sec5 and Exo84 seem to have different cellular localizations (11Jin R. Junutula J.R. Matern H.T. Ervin K.E. Scheller R.H. Brunger A.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2064-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, although RalA has been reported to regulate exocytosis in several scenarios, the generalized function of this ubiquitously expressed small GTPase in vesicle trafficking remains largely unknown. Importantly, RalA has also been implicated in signaling pathways controlling cell cycle progress, cell morphology, and oncogenic transformation (12Feig L.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A recent report highlights the oncogenic function of RalA, but not RalB, and the involvement of the exocyst in RalA-induced cellular transformation (13Lim K.H. Baines A.T. Fiordalisi J.J. Shipitsin M. Feig L.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Counter C.M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 533-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether RalA-mediated vesicular trafficking is directly involved in cell cycle progression.Here we present data suggesting a critical role for RalA and the exocyst in targeting recycling endosome (RE) 2The abbreviations used are: RE, recycling endosome; RBD, Ral binding domain; TfR, transferrin receptor; MTOC, microtubule organization center; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: RE, recycling endosome; RBD, Ral binding domain; TfR, transferrin receptor; MTOC, microtubule organization center; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; siRNA, small interfering RNA.-derived trafficking during the completion of cytokinesis in mammalian cells. RalA is RE-associated and relocalizes to the cleavage furrow, and later, to the abscission site. The exocyst, through a spatially and temporally regulated association with key cytokinetic structures, regulates the targeting of RalA-containing vesicles from RE. Disruption of this process leads to late stage cytokinesis failure.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs—Full-length Sec5 was obtained from a 3T3-L1 cDNA library by PCR and completely sequenced and then cloned into the pKH3 vector (14Inoue M. Chang L. Hwang J. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2003; 422: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Sec5 RBD-(1-120) and RalBP1 RBD-(397-519) were cloned into peYFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences). Sec5 Ral-binding domain (RBD) T11A was generated using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). RalA variants were cloned into pK-FLAG vector or peGFP-C3 vector (BD Biosciences).Cell Culture, Transfection, and Inhibitors—Cos-1 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units ml-1 streptomycin (Invitrogen). CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with the 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units ml-1 streptomycin. Cos-1 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's directions. All chemicals and inhibitors were from Sigma. Cells were treated at 37 °C with 33 μm nocodazole for 2 h, 2 μm cytochalasin D for 1 h, 2 μm brefeldin A for 2 h, or 0.5% tannic acids for 10 min.Immuno-fluorescence and Antibodies—Cells were grown on glass coverslips and washed with PBS before fixation. After fixation with methanol at -20 °C for 3 min, cells were rehydrated in PBS and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% chicken albumin. For RBD experiments, cells were fixed with 10% formalin at room temperature for 10 min, neutralized with 100 mm glycine/PBS, and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 before blocking. RalA localization remains the same in different fixation conditions. Primary antibodies used were α-tubulin (1:500, mAb), FLAG (1:500, rabbit IgG), and γ-adaptin(1:200, mAb) from Sigma; pericentrin (1:100, rabbit IgG) from Abcam; transferrin receptor (1:500, mAb), Rab11 (1:50, rabbit IgG) from Alpha Diagnostic; GM130 (1:100, mAb) from BD Biosciences; Sec8 (1:100, mAb) from Stressgen; hemagglutinin (1:500, mAb or rabbit IgG) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-Exo70 was described previously (18Polishchuk R. Di Pentima A. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Alexa Fluor-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor-conjugated phalloidin, and Vector Shield mounting medium were from Molecular Probe. The following antibodies were used in biochemical assays: RalA, Rab4, Nek2, EEA1 mAbs were from BD Biosciences; rabbit anti-Exo84 was from Orbigen; rabbit anti-Sec10 was kindly provided by Dr.Wei Guo (University of Pennsylvania).Western Blots—Cells were washed with PBS and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in buffer (buffer A) containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Individual proteins were detected with specific antibodies and visualized by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.Midbody Prep—CHO cell midbody prep was performed according to a previous study (15Skop A.R. Liu H. Yates J. II I Meyer B.J. Heald R. Science. 2004; 305: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The pellet fraction of interphase cells and cytokinetic cells treated with taxol and jas-plakinolide were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted with specific antibodies.Opti-Prep Gradient—Cos cells were washed with PBS, homogenized in HES buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) 10 times with a ball-bearing homogenizer (Wheaton), and spun at 3,000 × g for 3 min to generate postnuclear supernatant. To generate a 10-20-30% continuous gradient, 1.2 ml of postnuclear supernatant was mixed 1:1 with 60% iodixanol (Opti-Prep) and layered under 1.3 ml of 20% iodixanol and 1.2 ml of 10% iodixanol, respectively. The gradient was spun at 72,000 rpm in a fixed angle NVT90 rotor for 3 h at 4 °C and fractionated into 25 fractions. An equal volume of each fraction was loaded in SDS-PAGE.siRNA Knockdown—The following siRNA oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were used: RalA, 5′-CCAAGGGUCAGAAUUCUUU-3′ (oligonucleotide-1 sense), 5′-GCUAAUGUUGACAAGGUAU-3′ (oligonucleotide-2 sense); Sec8, 5′-CCUUGAUACCUCUCACUAU-3′ (oligonucleotide-1 sense), 5′-GCUUUCUCCAAUCUUUCUA-3′ (oligonucleotide-2 sense). Control oligonucleotides with medium GC content or fluorescent labeling were also from Invitrogen. 100 nm oligonucleotides were transfected into HeLa cells using Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 3 days, cells were trypsinized and replated at low density, and a second round of knockdown was performed. Cells were either harvested in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot or fixed for immunofluorescent microscopy.Time-lapse Microscopy—Cos cells expressing eGFP-RalA were treated with 100 nm nocodazole for 16 h. The mitotic cells were harvested by centrifuge and released into the cell cycle for 30-40 min before being imaged at 37 °C using an upright fluorescent spinning disk microscope (Leica). Images were taken under a ×63 oil lens at 30-s intervals.RESULTSActive Ral GTPase Is Localized on the Pericentrosomal Membrane and at the Centrosome—To explore the function of the Ral GTPase, we generated an eYFP-tagged RBD of Sec5 to probe the localization of active Ral in vivo. In contrast to previous studies in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (16Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 17Moskalenko S. Tong C. Rosse C. Mirey G. Formstecher E. Daviet L. Camonis J. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51743-51748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the fluorescent fusion protein mainly decorated the perinuclear region in the cytoplasm of quiescent Cos-1 cells rather than the plasma membrane (Fig. 1a, upper panel). We noticed that this fluorescent protein also localized to the nucleus as green fluorescent protein is known to non-specifically diffuse throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. The nuclear-localized fluorescent RBDs, however, may be isolated from Ral in the cytoplasm due to the presence of the nuclear envelope and thus cannot function as probes for activated Ral. Interestingly, in ∼20% of the transfected cells, Sec5 RBD decorated one or two bright dots near the nucleus. Co-staining with α-tubulin reveals that Sec5 RBD localized to the centrosome in interphase cells, as well as the centrosome-related abscission site in cells undergoing cytokinesis (Fig. 1a, lower panel). The same results were obtained with the RBD from RalBP1, another Ral-interacting protein (Fig. 1b). Nevertheless, Sec5 RBD T11A showed a distinct localization and did not concentrate at the pericentrosomal region (Fig. 1c and supplemental Fig. S1b) due to its substantially lower affinity for active Ral (supplemental Fig. S1a). Taken together, the data indicate that endogenous Ral can be activated at the centrosomal and pericentrosomal membranes.Several recent studies have implicated Ral GTPase in vesicle trafficking (12Feig L.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. We found that ectopically expressed RalA also co-localized with eYFP-RBDs in the same pericentrosomal tubule-vesicular structures, suggesting that a large fraction of active RalA associates with intracellular membranes in addition to the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S1c). Indeed, we observed that wild type RalA localized to the vesicular structures surrounding the centrosome/microtubule organization center and associated with the microtubule filament (Fig. 1d).RalA Is an RE-localized GTPase That Relocalizes during Cell Division—Despite the general notion that RalA can localize to the exocytotic vesicles in some specialized cells such as neurons and platelets (12Feig L.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the exact subcellular localization of this widely expressed GTPase is unclear. The pericentrosomal localization of RalA closely resembles the Golgi apparatus or the recycling endosome, two organelles often organized around the microtubule organization center. Consistent with a study in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells by Shipitsin and Feig (10Shipitsin M. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5746-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we observed that RalA co-localized with the recycling endosome markers TfR and partially with Rab11 in non-polarized Cos-1 cells but poorly with GM130 or γ-adaptin, which decorate the cis and trans Golgi membrane, respectively (Fig. 2a). In addition, disruption of the microtubule network by nocodazole or inhibition of vesicle flow by tannic acid (18Polishchuk R. Di Pentima A. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) abolished the pericentrosomal localization of RalA, whereas disassembly of Golgi by brefeldin A had little effect (supplemental Fig. S2).FIGURE 2RalA is an RE-localized GTPase that relocalizes during cell division. a, RalA co-localizes with TfR and Rab11 but not with γ-adaptin or GM130. Cos-1 cells transfected with eGFP-RalA wild-type cells were stained with antibodies against the indicated proteins (red). b, nocodazole treatment causes RalA to localize to punctuate structures that co-localize with TfR but not with GM130. c, cellular fractionation profile of RalA. Cos-1 cells were homogenized, and the postnuclear supernatant was separated using a linear 10-20-30% Opti-Prep gradient. An equal volume of each fraction was loaded on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel. Distribution of different proteins was determined by Western blot. d, cell cycle-dependent relocalization of RalA. Cos-1 cells expressing eGFP-RalA wild-type cells were stained with α-tubulin (red) antibody to determine the stages in cell cycle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nocodazole is able to disrupt the pericentrosomal localization of both recycling endosomes and the Golgi apparatus, separating these organelles into geographically distinct structures. We used this approach to further define the localization of RalA. As expected, RalA precisely co-localized with TfR in peripheral vesicular structures but not with GM130 (Fig. 2b), suggesting a preferred localization of RalA to the recycling endosome but not to Golgi. Furthermore, endogenous RalA partially overlapped with the TfR and Rab11 but not with the early endosome marker EEA1, the Golgi protein Syntaxin-6, or the cytosolic protein Akt in a linear Opti-Prep gradient (Fig. 2c). Notably, RalA also co-fractionated with Rab4, another GTPase known to regulate endosome recycling, suggesting the similar properties of the vesicular membranes marked by these GTPases. Taken together, we conclude that RalA localizes to a subset of recycling endosomes in both polarized and non-polarized cells, suggesting an important role of RalA in regulating vesicle trafficking via the endocytotic recycling route.Interestingly, we observed that RalA underwent cell cycle-dependent relocalization (Fig. 2d) similar to certain RE proteins involved in vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis (19Hickson G.R. Matheson J. Riggs B. Maier V.H. Fielding A.B. Prekeris R. Sullivan W. Barr F.A. Gould G.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2908-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Wilson G.M. Fielding A.B.

Co-staining of cells with α-tubulin revealed that RalA localized predominantly to the plasma membrane in mitosis, during which endosome recycling stops. However, upon the initiation of anaphase, RalA was targeted to the ingestion furrow, and later, to the intracellular bridge. Moreover, during the final step of cytokinesis, RalA localized to the abscission site, indicating a role for RalA in vesicle trafficking during the completion of cytokinesis.The Exocyst Is Spatially and Temporally Localized during the Cell Cycle—RalA has been implicated in polarized trafficking through its interaction with the exocyst complex, which plays an essential role in vesicle targeting during cytokinesis in lower organisms (7Dobbelaere J. Barral Y. Science. 2004; 305: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 9Wang H. Tang X. Liu J. Trautmann S. Balasundaram D. McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We thus postulated that the exocyst complex may also facilitate polarized vesicle trafficking during mammalian cytokinesis. Immuno-fluorescence microscopy showed a punctate localization throughout the cell for the exocyst subunit Sec8, which accumulated in the juxtanuclear region where it co-localized with the centrosome marker pericentrin. During mitosis and cytokinesis, however, Sec8 associated with the mitotic apparatus, including the spindle poles, and with cytokinetic structures, including the central spindles and the midbody (Fig. 3a). The same results were obtained using a different Sec8 antibody (data not shown). Another exocyst protein, Exo70, is also localized around and at the centrosome, and later, the midbody (supplemental Fig. S3), as is the overexpressed exocyst protein Sec5 (Fig. 3b) and Sec8 (data not shown). Notably, ectopic expression revealed that the exocyst proteins are enriched in the abscission site, indicating that the exocyst may also regulate vesicular trafficking to the abscission site of the dividing cells. This enrichment was not visualized by endogenous protein staining, possibly due to epitope masking, a common technical difficulty in midbody staining. A recent proteomics study profiling midbody-associated proteins revealed that the exocyst subunit Sec3 is associated with the midbody (15Skop A.R. Liu H. Yates J. II I Meyer B.J. Heald R. Science. 2004; 305: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that the exocyst proteins and RalA are present in biochemically isolated midbody from synchronized CHO cells (Fig. 3c), further suggesting that these proteins may participate in membrane trafficking during cytokinesis.FIGURE 3The exocyst is spatially and temporally regulated during the cell cycle. a, cell cycle-dependent relocalization of Sec8. Cos-1 cells were stained using antibodies against pericentrin (green) and Sec8 (red). Sec8 localizes to the centrosome during interphase and then concentrates on mitotic spindles (mitosis), central spindles (anaphase), and the midbody (cytokinesis). b, Cos-1 cells were transfected with hemagglutinin-Sec5 full-length and stained with antibody against pericentrin (green) and hemagglutinin (HA) (red). Cytokinetic cells with different expression levels of Sec5 were shown. c, biochemical evidence that the exocyst associates with the midbody.

We observed that overexpression of RalA in Cos-1 cells leads to a moderate increase of binucleated cells (Fig. 4a, upper panel), a phenotype commonly resulting from cytokinesis failure. However, we also observed that a significant fraction of the cells form two-cell syncytia connected by microtubule bundles, and one cell body shrinks and often detaches from the culture substrate (Fig. 4a, lower panel, and Fig. 4c). To investigate this phenomenon in detail, we performed live cell imaging on Cos-1 cells overexpressing eGFP-RalA (Fig. 4b). We found that upon the initiation of cytokinesis, RalA was transported to the intracellular bridge in vesicular bodies and also localized to the plasma membrane of the cleavage furrow, similar to what was visualized in fixed cells. As cytokinesis proceeds, RalA associates with the abscission sites localized at the center of the intracellular bridge. However, the cells remain interconnected for a long period of time (≥6 h after the initiation of cytokinesis), as determined by the persistent abscission site marked by eGFP-RalA, and finally, one cell collapses, possibly due to the increased cellular tension or triggering of apoptosis after failed cytokinesis (21Reichl E.M. Effler J.C. Robinson D.N. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Disruption of RalA-exocyst function results in late stage cytokinesis failure. a, overexpression of RalA leads to formation of binucleated cells (upper panel) and cell syncytia with persistent intracellular bridge (lower panel).

The efficiency of the knockdown was verified by fluorescent oligonucleotides (data not shown) and Western blot (Fig. 4e). When examined by immunofluorescence microscopy, both Sec8 and RalA knockdown in HeLa cells led to an increased number of binucleated cells. However, a significant percentage of cells formed syncytia with two, three, or four cells that are connected with prolonged yet stretched intracellular bridges (Fig. 4, d and f). These multicell syncytia may arise from failed cytokinesis following a second round of mitosis of the individual cells since one of the connected cells can re-enter mitosis. Taken together, the data indicate that disruption of the RalA-exocyst function leads to a late stage cytokinesis failure, likely resulting from incomplete abscission.DISCUSSIONMembrane trafficking is an essential but poorly understood step in cytokinesis (3Albertson R. Riggs B. Sullivan W. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We report here a critical role of the exocyst, as well as its interacting GTPase RalA, in directing membrane trafficking to the key cytokinetic structures in mammalian systems. Our data suggest that besides fulfilling a general need for membrane addition, the exocyst may mediate the delivery of a specific set of vesicles to the abscission site.The data described here support the idea that RE-derived membrane trafficking is crucial for the completion of cytokinesis (3Albertson R. Riggs B. Sullivan W. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 20Wilson G.M. Fielding A.B. Simon G.C. Yu X. Andrews P.D. Hames R.S.

We found that RalA is localized and activated on RE and RE-derived vesicles. Moreover, RalA is spatially and temporally regulated during cell division, coupled with the relocalization of exocyst proteins to cytokinetic structures. Disruptions of RalA or exocyst function lead to similar cell cycle defects. Taken together, these"

We identified a small molecule GK activator, compound A, that increased the glucose affinity and maximal velocity (Vmax) of GK. Compound A augmented insulin secretion from isolated rat islets and enhanced glucose utilization in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. In rat oral glucose tolerance tests, orally administrated compound A lowered plasma glucose elevation with a concomitant increase in plasma insulin and hepatic glycogen. In liver, GK activity is acutely controlled by its association to the glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). In order to decipher the molecular aspects of how GK activator affects the shuttling of GK between nucleus and cytoplasm, the effect of compound A on GK-GKRP interaction was further investigated. Compound A increased the level of cytoplasmic GK in both isolated rat primary hepatocytes and the liver tissues from rats. Experiments in a cell-free system revealed that compound A interacted with glucose-bound free GK, thereby impairing the association of GK and GKRP. On the other hand, compound A did not bind to glucose-unbound GK or GKRP-associated GK. Furthermore, we found that glucose-dependent GK-GKRP interaction also required ATP. Given the combined prominent role of GK on insulin secretion and hepatic glucose metabolism where the GK-GKRP mechanism is involved, activation of GK has a new therapeutic potential in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Given the combined prominent role of GK on insulin secretion and hepatic glucose metabolism where the GK-GKRP mechanism is involved, activation of GK has a new therapeutic potential in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. There are three key aspects of type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, which are the focus of current and future therapies: insulin resistance, defective insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose production. Glucokinase (GK) 2The abbreviations used are: GK, glucokinase; GKRP, glucokinase regulatory protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. is the predominant glucose phosphorylation enzyme in pancreatic β-cells and hepatocytes. GK plays an important role as a glucose sensor for controlling plasma glucose homeostasis by enhancing insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and glucose metabolism in the liver (1Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 2Matschinsky F.M. Glaser B. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), which provides rational expectations that enhancement of GK activity would be a novel therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes. Consistent with this rationale, recently discovered small molecule allosteric activators of GK have been demonstrated to have antidiabetic efficacy in rodents (3Grimsby J. Sarabu R. Corbett W.L. Haynes N.E. Bizzarro F.T. Coffey J.W. Guertin K.R. Hilliard D.W. Kester R.F. Mahaney P.E. Marcus L. Qi L. Spence C.L. Tengi J. Magnuson M.A. Chu C.A. Dvorozniak M.T. Matschinsky F.M. Grippo J.F.

To investigate the mechanism of action of GK activators, the interaction between GK and glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) is a key aspect. It is well known that hepatic GK activity is modulated by the endogenous inhibitor, glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) (5Van Schaftingen E. Veiga da Detheux M. Cunha M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8de la Mukhtar M. Iglesia N. Seoane J. Guinovart J.J. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10597-10603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). GK is localized in the nucleus as an inactive complex with GKRP at low glucose concentrations and is dissociated from the GK·GKRP complex and translocated to the cytoplasm at high glucose concentrations, which triggers glucose disposal (9Chu C.A. Fujimoto Y. Igawa K. Grimsby J. Grippo J.F. Magnuson M.A. Cherrington A.D. Shiota M. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2004; 286: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Modulators of the GK-GKRP interaction have been shown to enhance hepatic glucose disposal (7Shiota M. Galassetti P. Monohan M. Neal D.W. Cherrington A.D. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We recently solved the co-crystal structure of hepatic GK complex with GK activator, in which GK undergoes a large conformational change between the active and inactive forms at different glucose concentrations. According to these findings, we hypothesized that GK activator stabilized the active form of GK (10Kamata K. Mitsuya M. Nishimura T. Eiki J. Nagata Y. Structure. 2004; 12: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), which could influence not only the GK enzymatic activity but also the GK-GKRP interaction. In the present study, we report the mechanism of action of the novel GK activator, compound A, on the interaction of GK and GKRP and on GK subcellular localization in liver cells, the effect of GK activator in pancreatic islets and hepatocytes. Chemical—Compound A (2-amino-5-(4-methyl-4H-(1,2,4)triazole-3-yl-sulfanyl)-N-(4-methyl-thiazole-2-yl)benzamide) was prepared by Tsukuba Research Institute, Banyu Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Animals—Wistar rats (Charles River Japan, Inc.) were housed in the standard laboratory cages and fed normal rodent chow and water ad libitum until use. All animal experiments were conducted according to the Guidelines for Animal Experiments at Tsukuba Research Institutes Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Preparation of Recombinant GK and GKRP—Recombinant N-terminal FLAG-tagged human and rat liver GK were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α as described previously (11Mookhtiar K.A. Kalinowski S.S. Brown K.S. Tsay Y.H. Smith-Monroy C. Robinson G.W. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). N-terminal His-tagged human liver GK was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) using pET28a(+) vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). Human GKRP was expressed in vaculovirus Sf9 cells as a C-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion protein using pBacPac 9 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) (11Mookhtiar K.A. Kalinowski S.S. Brown K.S. Tsay Y.H. Smith-Monroy C. Robinson G.W. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged GK and GKRP were purified by anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich). His-tagged GK was purified using a His-Bind purification kit (Novagen). Purification of Antibodies—The antisera against human and rat liver GK and human GKRP were generated in rabbits using recombinant FLAG-tagged GK and GKRP as the antigen, respectively. The IgG components were obtained by protein A-Sepharose chromatography (Pfizer/Pharmacia, Groton, CT). For anti-rat liver GK antibody, the IgG component was further purified as described previously (12Toyoda Y. Miwa I. Kamiya M. Ogiso S. Nonogaki T. Aoki S. Okuda J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Glucokinase Assay—GK activity was measured by the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase coupled continuous spectrophotometric assay at 30 °C (11Mookhtiar K.A. Kalinowski S.S. Brown K.S. Tsay Y.H. Smith-Monroy C. Robinson G.W. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recombinant FLAG-tagged human hepatic GK was incubated in assay buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 2 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the indicated concentrations of glucose and compound A. Assay of Insulin Secretion—Islets of Langerhans were isolated from 9-week-old male Wistar rats by collagenase perfusion. After culturing overnight, insulin secretion of the islets was measured as previously reported (13Okamoto Y. Ishida H. Taminato T. Tsuji K. Kurose T. Tsuura Y. Kato S. Imura H. Seino Y. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1555-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, groups of 8-10 islets were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 2.8, 7.4, or 16.7 mm glucose, with or without addition of 10 or 30 μm compound A. Insulin concentration in the assay buffer was measured with an insulin ELISA kit (Morinaga, Yokohama, Japan). Glucose Phosphorylation, Glucose Oxidation, Glycogen Synthesis, and Glucose Output Assays in Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were isolated from 9-week-old male Wistar rats by collagenase perfusion. The effects of compound A on glucose phosphorylation, glucose oxidation, and glycogen synthesis were measured as described previously (14Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For measurement of glucose output, cells were incubated in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm dihydroxyacetone and compound A. After incubation, glucose concentration in the medium was determined by using determiner GLE (Kyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan). Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)—9-week-old male Wistar rats were fasted overnight before performing the test. The rats were orally administrated either compound A or vehicle alone (0.5% methylcellulose solution), followed 30 min later by an oral glucose challenge (2 g/kg). Plasma glucose concentrations were measured just prior to and following the glucose challenge (30, 60, 90, and 120 min). The blood insulin level was measured using an insulin ELISA kit (Morinaga). For measurement of glycogen content, livers were removed from the rats treated with compound A and glucose in the same schedule as described above, and hepatic glycogen was analyzed using a standard enzymatic assay (15Chan T.M. Exton J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry of GK in Rat Liver Tissue—9-weekold male Wistar rats were fasted overnight, and on the next morning, the rats were orally administrated either 10 mg/kg of compound A or vehicle alone (0.5% methylcellulose solution). Livers were taken from the rats at 0.5, 1, and 4 h after oral treatment. The liver tissues were excised and immersed overnight at 4 °C in Zamboni's solution (saturated picric acid/4% paraformaldehyde). The liver slices were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of 3 μm. The sections were mounted on silanized slides. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out as described previously (16Toyoda Y. Miwa I. Kamiya M. Ogiso S. Nonogaki T. Aoki S. Okuda J. Histochem Cell Biol. 1995; 103: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The total optical density of GK in the nucleus was quantitated and normalized by the total area of nucleus by computerized image analysis using Image-Pro Plus software (Planetron Inc. Tokyo, Japan). Immunofluorescent Staining of GK in Primary Rat Hepatocytes—Hepatocyte monolayers were washed with PBS and fixed for 40 min at 25 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Next, the monolayers were washed with PBS and permeabilized for 40 min at 25 °C with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. The permeabilized monolayers were washed with PBS and incubated with 3% BSA for 40 min at 25 °C. They were then incubated with anti-GK IgG overnight at 4 °C, followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti rabbit IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) for 40 min at 25 °C. Each incubation step was followed by three washes with PBS. Immunoprecipitation Assay of GK and GKRP Interaction— FLAG-tagged GKRP immobilized to anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel beads (Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated at 25 °C with His-tagged GK in a buffer of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, and several concentrations of glucose with or without fructose 6-phosphate. After 30 min, the GK·GKRP bead complexes were precipitated. The GK·GKRP complexes were eluted with FLAG peptides (Sigma-Aldrich) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by silver staining (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) and the intensities of the GK and GKRP bands were quantified using Imaging Gauge software (Fijifilm, Tokyo, Japan). For determination of the effect of compound A on the interaction between GK and GKRP, GK was preincubated with compound A for 10 min at 25 °C before formation of the GKRP complexes. The method was applied for determination of the effect of glucose or/and AMP-PNP (ATP analog: Sigma-Aldrich) on the interaction between GK and GKRP. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's paired t test. Effect of Glucokinase Activator, Compound A, on the Enzymatic Activity of Glucokinase—Compound A at concentrations from 0.05 to 30 μm enhanced the catalytic activity of recombinant human liver GK in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Kinetic analysis of GK showed that the shape of the glucose saturation curve changed from sigmoidal to Michaelis-Menten hyperbolic and that compound A increased the Vmax (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 10 μm compound A, the Vmax of the enzyme increased from 11.7 to 15.3 μmol/min/mg, and the substrate concentration at 0.5 Vmax ([S]0.5) for glucose decreased from 7.7 to 0.8 mm. Other hexokinase isozymes of human HK-I, HK-II, and HK-III were unaffected by the compound even at 30 μm (data not shown). Thus, the activating effect of compound A was specific for GK. Compound A also activated rat and mouse liver GK with similar potency observed with human liver GK (data not shown). Effect of Compound A on Insulin Secretion in Primary Cultured Rat Islets of Langerhans—The ability of compound A on glucose-stimulated insulin release was evaluated in cultured primary rat pancreatic islets (Fig. 2). Compound A significantly enhanced glucose-induced insulin release from the islets at 2.8, 7.4, and 16.7 mm glucose. In the presence of 30 μm compound A, the amount of insulin secreted at 2.8 mm glucose was almost equivalent to that secreted from control islets at 16.7 mm glucose. The amount of insulin was not further increased between 7.4 and 16.7 mm glucose in the islets treated with 30 μm compound A, suggesting that the secretion was at a maximum. Effect of Compound A on Glucose Metabolism in Cultured Primary Rat Hepatocytes—In addition to its role in pancreatic β-cells, GK plays an important role in the control of glucose metabolism in the liver. We investigated the effect of compound A on glucose metabolism in rat cultured primary hepatocytes using [2-3H]glucose or [U-14C]glucose in the presence of 6.25 mm glucose. When hepatocytes were treated with 0.03 to 30 μm compound A, the rate of glucose phosphorylation, glucose oxidation, and glycogen synthesis were enhanced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A-C). At a concentration of 30 μm, compound A increased the levels of glucose-phosphorylation, glucose oxidation, and glycogen production by 8.5-, 2.6-, and 7-fold, respectively. We also examined the production of glucose from the hepatocytes in the presence of 6.25 mm glucose and 10 mm dihydroxyacetone. We found that the glucose production was reduced by compound A (Fig. 3D). Effect of Compound A on Blood Glucose and Insulin Concentrations in Wistar Rats—In an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using fasted rats, oral single administration of compound A at 30 mg/kg decreased the plasma glucose elevation (Fig. 4A). In these rats, the plasma insulin levels were significantly increased, indicating that enhanced insulin release contributes to the glucose-lowering efficacy of compound A (Fig. 4B). The hepatic glycogen levels were increased in a time-dependent manner by compound A, indicating the direct activation of hepatic GK by compound A (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the results of the cell-based assay, these data demonstrate that the dual pancreatic and hepatic actions of the GK activator contribute to its glucose lowering efficacy in vivo. Effect of Glucokinase Activator on the Localization of GK in Rat Liver Tissue—The effect of compound A on the distribution of GK was further investigated in rat liver tissue at 0.5, 1, and 4 h after oral treatment with the compound A at 10 mg/kg (Fig. 5). In the liver tissues of 24 h-fasted rats, GK was predominantly detected in the nucleus. As a reference, we also examined the distribution of GK after oral administration of 2 g/kg glucose. As compared with 0 h, at 0.5 h after administration of compound A, the intensity of staining of nuclear GK diminished as the intensity of cytoplasmic staining increased concomitantly in liver cells, indicative of the translocation of nuclear GK to the cytoplasm. This effect was transient, because at 1.0 h, the cytoplasmic signal decreased, and the nuclear signal increased. At 4.0 h, GK immunostaining was found again in the nucleus only. Similar phenomena were observed in the liver of rats treated with 2 g/kg glucose in which the translocation of GK into the cytoplasm reached a peak at 1.0 h followed by GK moving back to the nucleus at 4.0 h. These data indicated that compound A mimicked the glucose effect on the translocation of GK. Effect of Glucokinase Activator on the Localization of GK in Rat Primary Hepatocytes—We next studied the effect of compound A on the localization of GK in rat primary hepatocytes by immunostaining with anti-GK antibody (Fig. 6). In hepatocyte monolayers cultured in 5.5 mm glucose, GK was exclusively stained in the nucleus (Fig. 6A). When the hepatocytes were exposed to 25 mm glucose, the nuclear-distributed GK was translocated to the cytoplasm (Fig. 6G). By treating with 30 μm of compound A in the presence of 5.5 mm glucose, GK was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm within 10 min (Fig. 6E). The cytoplasm-localized GK was redistributed to the nucleus within 1 h after removal of compound A from the medium (Fig. 6F), indicating that the effect of the compound on the GK distribution was reversible. In contrast to GK, immunostaining studies of GKRP showed that the localization of GKRP in the nucleus was not affected by exposure of either compound A or high glucose (data not shown). Effect of Glucokinase Activator on GK-GKRP Interaction in Vitro—Compound A increased the hepatic glucose phosphorylation apparently by enhancing GK catalytic activity. Because compound A increased the affinity of glucose to GK by changing protein conformation (Fig. 1 and Ref. 10Kamata K. Mitsuya M. Nishimura T. Eiki J. Nagata Y. Structure. 2004; 12: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of compound A on the GK-GKRP interaction. We established a co-immunoprecipitation assay using recombinant proteins in which we can quantitatively measure the amount of GK bound to GKRP. A mixture of recombinant His-tagged human hepatic GK and FLAG-tagged human GKRP in the ratio of 4:1 (16:4 μg) yielded a nearly 1:1 complex in the presence of 5.5 mm glucose and 0.4 mm fructose 6-phosphate, which is known to enhance the association of GK and GKRP (17Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8466-8473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Under this condition, compound A inhibited the interaction between GK and GKRP with an IC50 value of 16.4 μm (Fig. 7B). In order to clarify whether compound A inhibits the association of GK and GKRP or enhances the dissociation of GK from the GK·GKRP complex, compound A was added to the incubation mixture before or after formation of the GK·GKRP complex (Fig. 7C) in the absence of fructose 6-phosphate. When GK was preincubated with compound A before addition of GKRP in the presence of 5.5 or 25 mm glucose, the amount of GK bound to GKRP was reduced to 30% or 20% of the level of the corresponding vehicle control, respectively. On the other hand, when compound A was added to established GK·GKRP complexes in the presence of 5.5 or 25 mm glucose, the amount of GK bound to GKRP was 75% or 63% of the level of the vehicle control, respectively. These observations suggested that compound A preferentially interacts with free GK rather than the established GK·GKRP complex, resulting in inhibition of the association of GK and GKRP. To investigate whether glucose affects these interactions, the same assay was carried out in the absence of glucose (Fig. 7C). In the absence of glucose, GK preferentially interacts with GKRP. Surprisingly, compound A had no effect on the dissociation or association of GK and GKRP, indicating that compound A only binds to glucokinase in the presence of glucose. These results illustrate that compound A interacts with only the glucose-bound, free GK, but not with glucose-unbound or GKRP-associated GK. The Effect of Glucose and ATP on GK-GKRP Interaction—In the immunoprecipitation assay, the interaction of GK and GKRP was little affected by 25 mm of glucose in the absence of ATP (Fig. 7C). On the other hand, most GK was dissociated from GKRP in hepatocytes cultured in high concentration of glucose (Ref. 12Toyoda Y. Miwa I. Kamiya M. Ogiso S. Nonogaki T. Aoki S. Okuda J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and Fig. 6). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of glucose on the interaction of GK and GKRP in the presence of ATP. To prevent the hydrolysis of ATP by GK, ATP analog of AMP-PNP was used. Both ATP and AMP-PNP had little effect on the interaction of GK and GKRP by themselves in the absence of glucose (Fig. 8A). As shown in Fig. 8B, in the presence of 0.5 mm of AMP-PNP, the amount of GK bound to GKRP in the presence 5.5 mm glucose was almost the same as the control level without glucose and AMP-PNP, whereas the amount of GK bound to GKRP was reduced by half in the presence of 25 mm glucose. These results suggested that glucose-responsive inhibition of GK-GKRP interaction was evident only in the presence of ATP. The amount of the bound GK in the presence of 25 mm glucose and 0.5 mm AMP-PNP was further reduced by the treatment with compound A, suggesting that GK activator is effective in high glucose condition. We recently reported crystal structures of GK in a complex with and without our GK activator (10Kamata K. Mitsuya M. Nishimura T. Eiki J. Nagata Y.

GK activator interacts with GK-specific novel allosteric sites located in the hinge region where several gain-of-functional mutations are clustered (10Kamata K. Mitsuya M. Nishimura T. Eiki J.

Compound A has more metabolic stability than previous compound (10Kamata K. Mitsuya M. Nishimura T. Eiki J. Nagata Y. Structure. 2004; 12: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), enabling its use in in vivo studies. In the present study, compound A enhanced the enzymatic activity of GK by decreasing the [S0.5] for glucose and increasing the Vmax. Compound A increased the glucose-induced insulin secretion in isolated pancreatic islets. In addition, compound A enhanced the major hepatic glycolytic pathway (glucose phosphorylation, oxidation and glycogen synthesis) in rat primary hepatocytes. Compound A also impaired glucose output induced by dihydroxyacetone challenge, possibly because of the enhancement of the relative activity of glycolytic flow against gluconeogenesis. In hepatocyte, GK-GKRP interaction is a key mechanism for quick regulation of GK activity in response to changes in intracellular glucose concentrations. We hypothesized that the GK activator could affect the GK-GKRP interaction and measured the amount of GK in the complex with GKRP using a quantitative immunoprecipitation assay. We demonstrated that compound A inhibited the association of GK and GKRP with little effect on their dissociation. Importantly, in the absence of the GK substrate, glucose, compound A had no effect on the GK-GKRP interaction. From these data, we speculated that compound A preferentially associates with glucose-bound free GK but not with glucose-unbound free GK or with GK in a complex with GKRP. In the presence of glucose, GK stays in the active form in which a GK activator-accessible allosteric site exists. However, in the absence of glucose, GK undergoes a conformational change to form a so-called super-open inactive state in which the allosteric site is completely absent, thus preventing the binding of GK activator (10Kamata K. Mitsuya M. Nishimura T. Eiki J. Nagata Y. Structure. 2004; 12: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Taken together, it could be a possible idea that compound A binds only to the glucose-induced activated form of GK and stabilizes the activated state, thereby interfering with the formation of the GK·GKRP complex. In the immunoprecipitation assay, the amounts of GK·GKRP complex formation reached similar levels when glucose concentrations varied from 0 mm to 25 mm glucose in the absence of ATP, suggesting that GKRP can associate with glucose-bound GK as well as glucose-unbound GK. Glucose-dependent disruption of the complex was observed in the presence of nonhydrolytic ATP analog of AMP-PNP. AMP-PNP did not impair the association of GK and GKRP by itself. When GK was preincubated with compound A, the rate of complex formation was reduced by elevation of the glucose concentration (Fig. 7C, 5.5 versus 25 mm), whereas the complex formation was not reduced by elevation of the AMP-PNP concentration (data not shown), indicating that glucose binding is critically important to induce the conformation change to the active form of GK. Based on this observation and the structural information, it is possible that the glucose and compound A have additive effects in changing GK structure to a more active form that precludes its association with GKRP. It has been reported that inactive GK is localized in the nucleus as a complex with GKRP in hepatocytes and that GK is released from the complex to the cytoplasm when the glucose concentration is elevated (19Mukhtar M. Stubbs M. Agius L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We observed that treatment with compound A at a low glucose concentration enhanced the translocation of GK from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in both primary cultured rat hepatocytes and in rat liver tissue. Brocklehurst et al. (20Brocklehurst K.J. Payne V.A. Davies R.A. Carroll D. Vertigan H.L. Wightman H.J. Aiston S. Waddell I.D. Leighton B. Coghlan M.P. Agius L. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) also reported that translocation of GK to cytoplasm was caused by their synthetic GK activators in hepatocytes. The translocation of GK caused by treatment with compound A was similar to that in the hepatocytes treated with a high dose of glucose, indicating that compound A mimicked high glucose under low glucose conditions. Based on this and the above described data, it is proposed that compound A enhances glucose metabolism by dual mechanisms in hepatocytes by increasing the catalytic activity of GK itself and by stabilizing the activated state of GK, resulting in prevention of the association with GKRP and increasing the amount of free GK in the cytoplasm. It has been suggested that even at low glucose concentrations, a small portion of GK is constantly shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the liver cell (21Agius L. Peak M. Newgard C.B. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30479-30486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We speculate that compound A inhibits the shuttling and keeps GK in cytoplasm, consistent with the experimental observation that the level of cytosolic GK was increased in the presence of compound A. GKRP has been proposed to function not only as an inhibitory protein of GK but also as an anchor protein of GK in the hepatocyte nucleus, where GK is protected from degradation. Profiling of GKRP knock-out mouse shows that GK protein levels in hepatocytes are decreased (22Farrelly D. Brown K.S. Tieman A. Ren J. Lira S.A. Hagan D. Gregg R. Mookhtiar K.A. Hariharan N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14511-14516Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Grimsby J. Coffey J.W. Dvorozniak M.T. Magram J. Li G. Matschinsky F.M. Shiota C. Kaur S. Magnuson M.A. Grippo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7826-7831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, increasing the amount of GK in the cytoplasm by treatment with compound A could raise the potential risk of proteolysis of GK after chronic treatment, resulting in impairment of liver glucose utilization. However, the levels of hepatic GK protein were unchanged or even elevated in mice chronically treated with compound A (data not shown). The reason why hepatic GK protein was not decreased by chronic compound A treatment may be due to the reversible translocation of GK by compound A (Figs. 5 and 6) or enhanced insulin release, which may cause the increase of expression of liver GK. It is also possible that GK activator-bound GK is more resistant to proteolysis because of its rigid conformation (10Kamata K. Mitsuya M. Nishimura T. Eiki J. Nagata Y. Structure. 2004; 12: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In rat OGTT experiment, 30 mg/kg of compound A dramatically reduced the blood glucose levels, accompanied by the elevation of plasma insulin and hepatic glycogen synthesis (Fig. 4). The hepatic glucose metabolism is thought to be enhanced by direct activation of hepatic GK or secondary effect of increased plasma insulin presumably because of beta-cell GK activation. We recently observed that glucokinase activator was able to enhance net hepatic glucose uptake in the absence of insulin secretion by somatostatin infusion (24Eiki J. Kasuga K. Sasaki K. Yoshimoto R. Nishimura T. Iino T. Nagata Y. Zhang B. Ogihara N. Kikuchi M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: A328Google Scholar). From this evidence, both stimulation of insulin secretion and enhancement of hepatic glucose utilization are clearly involved in the mechanism of the glucose lowering efficacy of compound A. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a novel glucokinase activator, compound A, has blood glucose-lowering efficacy due to a dual mechanism of augmenting islet insulin release and enhancing hepatic glucose disposal. In the liver, the GK activator was found to work in two ways, i.e. by increasing GK enzyme catalytic activity and enhancing GK translocation. Both of these effects contribute to augmentation of hepatic glucose disposal. These findings suggest that GK activators have outstanding potentials to provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and related disorders.

However, in some cases, STAT3 has been shown to be pro-apoptotic, especially in mammary epithelial cells. In this report, we generated SOCS3-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), in which STAT3 activation is extremely enhanced and prolonged. We found that LIF induces caspase-3 activation and apoptosis of SOCS3<sup>–/–</sup> MEFs. Exogenous expression of the dominant negative form of STAT3 but not STAT1 suppressed LIF-induced apoptosis of SOCS3<sup>–/–</sup> MEFs, indicating that STAT3 plays a critical role in apoptosis induction. As shown in mammary gland epithelial cells, expression of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunits <i>p50</i>α and <i>p55</i>α was induced in response to LIF in SOCS3<sup>–/–</sup> MEFs but not in wild-type MEFs, and Akt/protein kinase B activity was substantially reduced in SOCS3<sup>–/–</sup> MEFs. Furthermore, we found that some of the STAT3 target genes related to apoptosis and proliferation, such as <i>Bcl-2</i> and cyclin D1, were repressed upon LIF treatment in SOCS3<sup>–/–</sup> cells. Not only the up-regulation of <i>p50</i>α and <i>p55</i>α but also the repression of cyclin D1 and <i>Bcl-2</i> in SOCS3<sup>–/–</sup> MEFs was inhibited by dominant negative STAT3. These data suggest that prolonged activation of STAT3 could induce apoptosis/growth arrest rather than anti-apoptosis and proliferation in certain cases, and SOCS3 is a critical regulator of this balance."

While the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines was previously reported to be involved in adipogenesis, roles of this family in adipogenesis and their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Here we show that among the IL-6 family, oncostatin M (OSM) most strongly inhibits adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We also demonstrate that OSM inhibits adipogenesis through the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 signaling pathways. In addition, OSM inhibits the early phase of the differentiation without affecting cell proliferation throughout adipogenesis including mitotic clonal expansion.

Forced expression of C/EBPβ induced differentiation in the presence of troglitazone, and OSM inhibited this C/EBPβ-induced differentiation.

Adipocytes are a major energy reservoir, storing excess energy as lipids and releasing it on demand. In addition, adipocytes constitute an endocrine system by secreting soluble mediators known as adipokines, which regulate not only peripheral tissues such as muscles and adipose tissues but also the central nervous system (1Ahima R.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 307-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Disorders in adipose tissues are a major cause of the development of the metabolic syndrome, a common basis of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular diseases (2Matsuzawa Y. Nat. Clin. Pract. Cardiovasc. Med. 2006; 3: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to understand the nature of adipocytes and the mechanism of adipocyte differentiation. The mechanism of adipocyte differentiation has been studied by using preadipocyte cell lines, primary cultured cells, and genetically manipulated mice. These studies have identified several transcription factors required for adipogenesis, e.g. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) 3The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; IL, interleukin; OSM, oncostatin M; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; GFP, green fluorescent protein. α, C/EBPβ, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ (3Rosen E.D.

Kasuga M. Itoh N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas some inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1, inhibit adipogenesis (4Tong Q.

Shibuya H. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Kato S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine and together with IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) constitutes the IL-6 family of cytokines, which share a common signal transducing receptor subunit, gp130. The members of this family play important roles in the development and maintenance of various biological systems such as the immune, hematopoietic, endocrine, and neuronal systems (8Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 9Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). A number of reports have implicated the IL-6 family in adipogenesis, though their results were somewhat controversial, e.g. IL-6 was reported to inhibit adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (10Ohsumi J.

Du X.X. Srour E.F. Hoffman R. Williams D.A. Blood. 1993; 82: 1428-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and CT-1 and CNTF did not affect adipogenesis, though they induced signals in 3T3-L1 cells (16Zvonic S. Hogan J.C. Arbour-Reily P.

Because these studies were conducted mostly by using cultured cells, the controversy could be due to the developmental stage of cells and tissues used by different investigators. In any case, the precise molecular mechanisms of these effects remain unclear, and it is important to evaluate the effects of these cytokines under the same conditions to clarify the mechanisms. Although TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6 are inflammatory cytokines, their modes of action are different. Major TNFα and IL-1 signaling pathways involve the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by the transforming growth factor β-activated kinase (TAK)/TAK1-binding protein (TAB) 1/NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) cascade and the caspase cascade, whereas the IL-6 family activates mainly Ras/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways. Extensive studies on the mechanism by which TNFα and IL-1 suppress adipogenesis have shown that they suppress adipocyte differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells by inhibiting PPARγ function through NF-κB activated by the TAK/TAB1/NIK cascade (7Suzawa M. Takada I. Yanagisawa J. Ohtake F. Ogawa S. Yamauchi T. Kadowaki T. Takeuchi Y. Shibuya H. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Kato S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As TNFα and the IL-6 family of cytokines induce different signaling pathways, it is expected that the IL-6 family would affect adipogenesis through a mechanism distinct from TNFα. In this article we attempted to clarify the roles of the IL-6 family of cytokines in adipogenesis and their mechanisms of action. We compared the effect of IL-6, IL-11, OSM, and LIF on adipocyte differentiation by using primary cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and 3T3-L1 cells, a preadipocyte cell line. We found that among the family members tested, OSM most strongly suppressed the differentiation of both MEFs and 3T3-L1 cells. OSM exhibits a wide variety of activities being involved in immune regulation (18Clegg C.H. Rulffes J.T. Wallace P.M. Haugen H.S.

Hepatology. 2004; 39: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). OSM elicits its functions through the OSM receptor consisting of gp130 and the OSM-specific subunit by activating the Ras/ERK, STAT3, and STAT5 signaling pathways. However, the roles of OSM in adipogenesis have not been well investigated. Here we demonstrate that OSM inhibits the early phase of the differentiation process through the Ras/ERK and STAT5 signaling pathways by possibly regulating C/EBPβ activity without affecting cell proliferation. 3T3-L1 Cell Culture and Enumeration of Cells—3T3-L1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) containing 10% bovine serum (BS) (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Wako). To induce adipocyte differentiation, the medium was changed to DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 10-6 m dexamethason (Dex) (Wako), 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml human insulin (Wako) 2 days after cells became confluent and incubated for 2 days. Medium was then changed to DMEM with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 5 μg/ml human insulin. After 2 days, the medium was then changed to DMEM with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and thereafter, the medium was changed every 2 days. For determining cell numbers, cells treated with 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen) were resuspended in the culture medium and the number of cells was counted with a hemocytometer. Isolation and Culture of MEFs—MEFs were isolated from mouse embryos at 14.5 days postcoitum. Briefly, embryos were chopped into pieces and incubated in 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 50 min with periodic agitation. Cells dispersed by pipetting were passed through a 70-μm cell strainer and washed with DMEM with 10% FBS (EQUITECH-BIO) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Cell culture condition and differentiation protocols were the same as for 3T3-L1 cells except that MEFs were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS (EQUITECH-BIO) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin until confluent. Plasmids, Reagents, and Antibodies—cDNAs encoding STAT5B1*6, STAT5B2, and ΔSTAT5A were kindly provided by Dr. T. Kitamura (Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo). All the cDNAs used in this study including STAT3-C and ΔSTAT3 were inserted into the pMXs-IRES-GFP vector as previously described (22Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T.

Cytokines used in this study were recombinant murine (rm)OSM (R&D), rmIL-6 (PeproTech), recombinant human (rh)IL-11 (Genzyme Techne), rmLIF (Genzyme Techne), and rhFGF basic (bFGF) (PeproTech). Antibodies against ERK1/2 (9102), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (9101), STAT3 (9132), phosphorylated STAT3 (9131), and phosphorylated STAT5 (9351) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against STAT5 (sc-835), C/EBPβ (sc-150), and actin (sc-1616) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Oil-red O Staining of Cells—Cells were fixed with a 20% formalin solution for 5 min and washed with water and then 60% isopropyl alcohol. After being washed, cells were incubated in Oil-red O (Sigma) staining solution: 1.8 mg/ml in 60% isopropyl alcohol at 37 °C for 30 min. The excess staining solution was removed by washing with 60% isopropyl alcohol and water. Retroviral Infection of 3T3-L1 Cells—The virus packaging cells PLAT-E were transfected with 6 μg of pMXs-IRES-GFP construct per 10-cm dish using FuGENE6 Transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the medium was changed, and subsequently cells were incubated for 24 h. Then, viruses were precipitated by centrifuging at 6,000 × g overnight, resuspended in DMEM containing 10% BS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma), and used as the viral suspension. 3T3-L1 cells cultured in 6-well plates were incubated with 1 ml of viral solution for 8 h. Then, 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% BS, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 8 μg/ml polybrene was added and the incubation continued for 16 h. The viral solution was then washed out three times with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). The efficiency of infection was estimated by measuring GFP expression using flow cytometry. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5 μg) resolved by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel was transferred to a positively charged Nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science) and RNA was cross-linked to the membrane using UV-stratalinker (Stratagene). We applied the DIG-labeling system (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysate was prepared with lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Roche Applied Science), 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Wako), and 500 μg/ml Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science). To detect the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, STAT3, and STAT5, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 were added to this lysis buffer. Total cell lysate was dissolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon-P Membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBSt) with 1% skim milk at 4 °C overnight. It was then incubated with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) or goat (Jackson ImmunoResearch) IgG-horseradish peroxidase) in TBSt with 1% skim milk at room temperature for 2 h. The signals were detected by Western Lightning (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) Incorporation Assay—3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate on a cover glass in a 6-well plate. Twelve hours later, BrdU (Sigma) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 10 μm, and the cells were incubated for an additional 12 h. Then, cells were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, denatured with 2 m HCl, and neutralized with 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.5). After blocking with ImmunoBlock (Dainipponseiyaku) at 4 °C overnight, cells were incubated with anti-BrdU antibody (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were next incubated with anti-mouse IgG-Rhodamine (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. The cover glass was mounted with GEL/MOUNT (biomeda) containing Hoechst33342 on a slide glass and fluorescence was observed. Rhodamine and Hoechst33342-positive cells were counted in 6 different microscopic views from 3 different cover glasses for each sample. The total number of cells in each view ranged from 120 to 182. OSM Strongly Inhibits Adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 Cells and MEFs—3T3-L1 cells are induced to differentiate by Dex, IBMX, and insulin and have been extensively used as a model for adipocyte differentiation. To evaluate roles for the IL-6 family in adipogenesis, 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes in the presence of 10 ng/ml of OSM, IL-6, IL-11, or LIF. The extent of the differentiation was confirmed by Oil-red O staining and also by the expression of mRNA of aP2, C/EBPα, and PPARγ, which are known to be expressed in mature adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells was inhibited strongly by OSM and weakly by LIF, whereas IL-6 and IL-11 had no significant effect. To investigate whether the inhibitory effect of OSM in adipogenesis is specific to 3T3-L1 cells or not, we tested another adipogenic system. Because MEFs are known to differentiate into mature adipocytes when exposed to Dex, IBMX, and insulin in a manner similar to 3T3-L1 cells, the effect of the IL-6 family was evaluated in MEFs. Oil-red O staining and northern blotting revealed that OSM also strongly inhibited adipogenesis of MEFs, whereas IL-6 and IL-11 had no effect. Unlike in 3T3-L1 cells, LIF did not significantly alter adipogenesis in MEFs (Fig. 1, C and D). Adipocyte differentiation of bone marrow stroma cells was also inhibited by OSM (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that OSM regulates adipogenesis in various tissues. Hereafter, we used 3T3-L1 cells to analyze the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of OSM on adipogenesis. Activation of the Ras/ERK and STAT5 Signaling Pathways by OSM and LIF—Next, we investigated signaling pathways responsible for the inhibition of adipogenesis by OSM in 3T3-L1 cells. Because OSM is known to activate the Ras/ERK, STAT3, and STAT5 signaling pathways, we examined the activation of these signaling pathways by monitoring the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, STAT3, and STAT5 in 3T3-L1 cells. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was induced strongly by OSM and weakly by LIF, but was only marginally induced by IL-6 and IL-11. Whereas all of the IL-6 family cytokines induced phosphorylation of STAT3, only OSM and LIF phosphorylated STAT5 (Fig. 2). The fact that all four cytokines phosphorylated STAT3 indicates that receptors for these cytokines were expressed substantially. As the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was inhibited by OSM and LIF but not by IL-6 and IL-11 (Fig. 1, A and B), the Ras/ERK and STAT5 signaling pathways, but not STAT3, were expected to play important roles in the inhibitory effect of OSM. In fact, retroviral expression of the active (STAT3-C) or dominant-negative form (ΔSTAT3) of STAT3 (23Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) did not affect adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells regardless of the presence or absence of OSM (data not shown). Inhibition of the Ras/ERK Signaling Pathway Partially Recovers Adipogenesis in the Presence of OSM—To reveal whether the Ras/ERK signaling pathway is involved in the inhibitory effect of OSM, we blocked the Ras/ERK signaling with a mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, in the presence of OSM. PD98059 completely blocked the activation of ERK1/2 induced by OSM in 3T3-L1 cells as demonstrated by a lack of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A). Then, we induced the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells in the presence of OSM with or without PD98059. OSM inhibited the expression of aP2, C/EBPα, and PPARγ in the absence of PD98059, but the addition of PD98059 cancelled the inhibitory effect (Fig. 3B). However, lipid accumulation in cells was not fully recovered by PD98059 (Fig. 3C). These results clearly indicate that the Ras/ERK signaling pathway partially, but not entirely, contributes to the inhibition of adipogenesis by OSM. STAT5 Mediates the Inhibitory Effect of OSM on Adipogenesis—Because of the observation that blocking of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway did not fully recover lipid accumulation in the presence of OSM (Fig. 3C) and different modes of signaling activated by the IL-6 family (Fig. 2), we speculated that STAT5 also plays a role in the inhibitory effect of OSM. However, it was previously shown that induction of adipocyte differentiation by Dex, IBMX, and insulin was accompanied by the activation of STAT5 and was necessary for the early phase of differentiation (25Nanbu-Wakao R. Morikawa Y. Matsumura I. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M.A. Senba E. Wakao H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1565-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To address the role of STAT5, we first retrovirally introduced STAT5B1*6 (an active form of STAT5) (26Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and ΔSTAT5A (a dominant negative form of STAT5) (27Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) into 3T3-L1 cells and induced these cells to differentiate into mature adipocytes with Dex, IBMX, and insulin in the absence of OSM. The infection efficiencies of the control, STAT5B1*6, and ΔSTAT5A virus were 95, 65, and 92%, respectively. Consistent with a previous report, ΔSTAT5A inhibited the differentiation. Interestingly, STAT5B1*6 inhibited the differentiation more severely than ΔSTAT5A, though the infection efficiency of the STAT5B1*6 virus was lower than that of ΔSTAT5A (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with another active form of STAT5, STAT5B2 (28Ariyoshi K. Nosaka T. Yamada K. Onishi M. Oka Y. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24407-24413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, when the cells were induced to differentiate in the presence of OSM, the level of expression of adipogenic genes in cells with ΔSTAT5A was significantly higher than that in control cells (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that STAT5 activation is necessary for the induction of differentiation, but continuous and excessive activation is inhibitory to the maturation of 3T3-L1 cells, and the STAT5 signaling pathway as well as the Ras/ERK signaling pathway contributes to the inhibitory effect of OSM. OSM Inhibits the Onset of Terminal Differentiation without Affecting C/EBPβ Induction and Mitotic Clonal Expansion—To reveal in more detail the mechanism behind the inhibitory effect of OSM, we first investigated the expression of the OSM-specific receptor subunit, the OSM receptor (OSMR), and gp130 during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. OSMR expression was highest 1 day after the induction of differentiation and diminished after day 3, while gp130 was expressed for the first day, and its level diminished thereafter (Fig. 5A). Because of the expression patterns of the receptor subunits, OSM was expected to exert its inhibitory effect in an early stage of differentiation. To test this possibility, we added 10 ng/ml of OSM for different periods during the differentiation process as indicated in Fig. 5B. The extent of differentiation was confirmed by Oil-red O staining and Northern blotting. The presence of OSM in the first 2 days was enough to almost completely inhibit the differentiation, while cells significantly differentiated when OSM was added after that time (Fig. 5, B and C). These observations are consistent with the expression patterns of OSMR and gp130 (Fig. 5A). It is well known that in the first 2 days of the differentiation process, the expression of C/EBPβ is up-regulated and 3T3-L1 cells undergo several rounds of the cell cycle, which is known as mitotic clonal expansion. After mitotic clonal expansion, the cells undergo terminal differentiation through which they acquire the characteristics of mature adipocytes. Thus, we investigated which steps were affected by OSM. In the absence of OSM, the C/EBPβ mRNA level peaked at 1-2 days after induction of the differentiation process (Fig. 5A). In this period, the mRNA level of C/EBPβ was not changed by OSM (Fig. 6A). Three major C/EBPβ protein isoforms are known to be produced from the same C/EBPβ mRNA, namely LAP*, LAP, and LIP. LAP* and LAP are transcriptional activators, while LIP is an inhibitor. OSM affected neither of them (Fig. 6A). 3T3-L1 cells undergoing mitotic clonal expansion show a fibroblastic cell morphology, which indicates reentry of the cells into the cell division cycle. We observed that OSM had no effect on cell morphology in the first 2 days (Fig. 6B). To more directly assess the effect of OSM on cell proliferation in mitotic clonal expansion, we performed a BrdU incorporation assay. 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate in the presence or absence of OSM, and their incorporation of BrdU from 12 to 24 h after the induction was measured. Fig. 6C shows representative photographs and results of a quantitative analysis of BrdU-positive cells. Consistent with the morphological observations (Fig. 6B), OSM did not significantly affect cell proliferation during mitotic clonal expansion. In contrast, OSM inhibited the expression of aP2 which was up-regulated 2 days post-induction in the absence of OSM (Figs. 5A and 6A). These results indicate that OSM inhibits the onset of terminal differentiation without affecting the C/EBPβ induction and mitotic clonal expansion. OSM Attenuates C/EBPβ-induced Adipogenesis—At the onset of terminal differentiation, C/EBPβ up-regulates the transcription of C/EBPα and PPARγ and then C/EBPα and PPARγ upregulate each other's transcription, allowing the cells to acquire characteristics of mature adipocytes through terminal differentiation. It is thus possible that OSM blocks the function of C/EBPβ, leading to inhibition of the up-regulation of C/EBPα and PPARγ, and the onset of terminal differentiation, although OSM does not alter the level of C/EBPβ (Fig. 6A). To reveal the relation between OSM effect and C/EBPβ function, we expressed C/EBPβ in 3T3-L1 cells by using a retroviral vector and evaluated the effect of OSM on adipogenesis using these transfectants. In this case, it was assumed that endogenous C/EBPβ expression induced by Dex, IBMX, and insulin would make the interpretation of results difficult. For this reason, we utilized troglitazone, a synthetic ligand for PPARγ, to enhance the differentiation, instead of Dex, IBMX, and insulin. The efficiency of infection for the control and C/EBPβ expression vectors was 90 and 96%, respectively. We monitored the differentiation by Oil-red O staining and Northern blotting. Under the conditions, control cells did not differentiate into mature adipocytes but the introduction of C/EBPβ allowed the cells to differentiate (Fig. 6, D and E), indicating that this adipogenesis was driven by exogenously introduced C/EBPβ. Then, 10 ng/ml of OSM was added to the cells to evaluate the effect of OSM on C/EBPβ-induced adipogenesis. OSM almost completely suppressed both lipid accumulation and up-regulation of the expression of mature adipocyte-specific genes in these cells (Fig. 6, D and E). These results strongly suggest that OSM interrupts the function of C/EBPβ, and thereby inhibits the onset of terminal differentiation. OSM Does Not Affect Cell Proliferation throughout Adipocyte Differentiation—At the end of mitotic clonal expansion, the cells cease proliferation and proceed with terminal differentiation. It is known that, however, if the cells are kept proliferative after mitotic clonal expansion, they cannot undergo terminal differentiation. To clarify whether the inhibitory function of OSM is caused by prolonged proliferation, we induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells in the presence of 10 ng/ml of OSM or bFGF and compared their effects. Both OSM and bFGF completely inhibited lipid accumulation and the expression of adipogenic genes, but cell density was higher in the presence of bFGF than OSM (Fig. 7, A and B). We therefore investigated whether OSM and/or bFGF affect cell proliferation during adipogenesis. We counted the cell number 2, 4, and 6 days after the induction of differentiation. OSM did not change the cell number significantly throughout adipogenesis compared with the cells without cytokines (Fig. 7C). These results are consistent with our observation that OSM does not affect mitotic clonal expansion (Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, bFGF significantly increased the cell number throughout adipogenesis (Fig. 7C). These results indicate that prolonged exposure of 3T3-L1 cells to bFGF keeps the cells proliferative and inhibits adipogenesis, whereas OSM inhibits adipogenesis via a mechanism distinct from bFGF, because it does not affect cell proliferation throughout the differentiation process. Finally, we compared the signaling pathways activated by bFGF and OSM in 3T3-L1 cells to reveal which pathways are important for the OSM-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis. bFGF activated the Ras/ERK signaling pathway at a level comparable to OSM, but bFGF failed to activate the STAT3 and STAT5 signaling pathways (Fig. 7D). These results suggest that OSM inhibits adipogenesis via the STATs signaling pathways as well as the Ras/ERK signaling pathway. Almost all previous studies on roles for the IL-6 family in adipogenesis were conducted independently for each cytokine using different cell systems. Gimble et al. (29Gimble J.M. Wanker F. Wang C.S. Bass H. Wu X. Kelly K. Yancopoulos G.D. Hill M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported that IL-6, IL-11, LIF, and OSM inhibit the adipogenesis of a murine stroma cell line, BMS2, and compared the effects of these cytokines. However, their results must be interpreted carefully, because they used human LIF and OSM in their study. In murine cells, human OSM activates intracellular signals through LIFR but not OSMR (30Lindberg R.A. Juan T.S. Welcher A.A. Sun Y. Cupples R. Guthrie B. Fletcher F.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3357-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have compared the effects of OSM, IL-6, IL-11, and LIF on adipocyte differentiation under the same conditions by using MEFs and 3T3-L1 cells, and demonstrated that adipogenesis was most profoundly inhibited by OSM, and to a lesser extent, by LIF. In contrast, IL-6 and IL-11 showed no significant effect (Fig. 1). Similar results were also obtained in the differentiation of bone marrow stroma cells (data not shown). OSM most strongly activated the Ras/ERK and STAT5 signaling pathways, suggesting that OSM exerts its inhibitory activity through ERK1/2 and/or STAT5 (Fig. 2). In fact, blocking the activation of ERK1/2 by PD98059 partially recovered the differentiation process in the presence of OSM, indicating that the Ras/ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in the suppression of adipogenesis (Fig. 3). Consistent with our results, the Ras/ERK signaling pathway was previously shown to inhibit adipogenesis (31Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). However, it was also reported that the Ras/ERK signaling pathway enhanced adipogenesis (33Benito M. Porras A. Nebreda A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 253: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 34Prusty D. Park B.H. Davis K.E. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46226-46232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Those apparently contradictory results may be explained by dual roles of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway in adipogenesis. The differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes proceeds through two steps, mitotic clonal expansion and terminal differentiation. The Ras/ERK signaling pathway is essential for the mitotic clonal expansion stage (34Prusty D. Park B.H. Davis K.E. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46226-46232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), whereas prolonged and excessive activation may block terminal differentiation. It should be noted that the blocking of ERK1/2's activation by PD98059 did not completely recover adipocyte differentiation in the presence of OSM, indicating that an additional signaling pathway is involved in the inhibitory effect of OSM. Consistent with the report that STAT5 activity is required for adipogenesis (25Nanbu-Wakao R. Morikawa Y. Matsumura I. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M.A. Senba E. Wakao H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1565-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), enforced expression of a dominant negative form of STAT5 inhibited adipogenesis in the absence of OSM. Interestingly, however, enforced expression of an active form of STAT5 also inhibited adipogenesis in the absence of OSM, and dominant negative STAT5 rescued adipogenesis from the inhibitory effect of OSM (Fig. 4). These results clearly demonstrate for the first time that like the Ras/ERK signaling pathway, deregulated activation of the STAT5 signaling pathway is inhibitory for adipogenesis. Because STAT5 is activated in the early phase of the differentiation process (25Nanbu-Wakao R. Morikawa Y. Matsumura I. Masuho Y. Muramatsu M.A. Senba E. Wakao H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1565-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and is a positive regulator of proliferation (35Mui A.L. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), it may be required for mitotic clonal expansion but continuous and excessive activation of STAT5 may be inhibitory for terminal differentiation. This is consistent with our observation that OSM inhibits the onset of terminal differentiation without affecting mitotic clonal expansion (Fig. 6, A-C). Adipogenesis requires functions of C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, and PPARγ. When growth-arrested 3T3-L1 cells are induced to differentiate, C/EBPβ is rapidly induced and after a long latency, C/EBPα and PPARγ are expressed in a mutually regulated manner. Activation of C/EBPβ by phosphorylation is required for mitotic clonal expansion and also for the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ, which are anti-mitotic and regulate the expression of various adipogenic genes. We have demonstrated that OSM down-regulates the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ, which is recovered by blocking the Ras/ERK or STAT5 signaling pathways (Figs. 3B and 4B). In contrast, OSM had no effect on the mRNA and protein levels of C/EBPβ (Fig. 6A). As reported previously, we observed up-regulation of C/EBPβ expression in the first 2 days after the induction of differentiation, when mitotic clonal expansion occurred. We also observed that the presence of OSM in this period was crucial to the inhibitory effect (Fig. 5). These results tempted us to examine the possibility that OSM interrupts the function of C/EBPβ. Enforced expression of C/EBPβ in the presence of troglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, induced adipocyte differentiation without Dex, IBMX, and insulin. In these conditions, OSM suppressed the expression of aP2, C/EBPα, and PPARγ and lipid accumulation (Fig. 6, D and E). These results strongly suggest that OSM modulates the function of C/EBPβ, which then affects the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ. As oncogenic Ras has been reported to diminish the level of C/EBPα (36Shim M. Powers K.L. Ewing S.J. Zhu S. Smart R.C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 861-867PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that OSM diminishes the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ by modulating C/EBPβ activity. Finally, we demonstrated that OSM did not affect cell proliferation throughout the differentiation process, whereas bFGF induced proliferation and inhibited adipogenesis (Fig. 7, A-C). These results indicate that OSM does not inhibit adipogenesis by stimulating mitosis. Unlike OSM, bFGF activated the Ras/ERK signaling pathway, but not the STAT3 and STAT5 signaling pathways (Fig. 7D). Because the excessive activation of STAT5, not STAT3, is inhibitory for adipogenesis (Fig. 4), the OSM-specific inhibitory effect should be caused by the STAT5 signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study shows that among the IL-6 family of cytokines, OSM strongly suppresses the onset of adipocyte differentiation via the Ras/ERK and STAT5 signaling pathways by possibly modulating the function of C/EBPβ.

https://openalex.org/W2048514487,"S100A16 protein is a new and unique member of the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding proteins. S100 proteins are cell- and tissue-specific and are involved in many intra- and extracellular processes through interacting with specific target proteins. In the central nervous system S100 proteins are implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis as well as in cognition. S100 proteins became of major interest because of their close association with brain pathologies, for example depression or Alzheimer's disease. Here we report for the first time the purification and biochemical characterization of human and mouse recombinant S100A16 proteins. Flow dialysis revealed that both homodimeric S100A16 proteins bind two Ca(2+) ions with the C-terminal EF-hand of each subunit, the human protein exhibiting a 2-fold higher affinity. Trp fluorescence variations indicate conformational changes in the orthologous proteins upon Ca(2+) binding, whereas formation of a hydrophobic patch, implicated in target protein recognition, only occurs in the human S100A16 protein. In situ hybridization analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed a widespread distribution in the mouse brain. Furthermore, S100A16 expression was found to be astrocyte-specific. Finally, we investigated S100A16 intracellular localization in human glioblastoma cells. The protein was found to accumulate within nucleoli and to translocate to the cytoplasm in response to Ca(2+) stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2133127604,"Recently we showed that, in human breast cancer cells, activation of protein kinase C by 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) produced ceramide formed from the salvage pathway (Becker, K. P., Kitatani, K., Idkowiak-Baldys, J., Bielawski, J., and Hannun, Y. A. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 2606-2612). In this study, we investigated intracellular signaling events mediated by this novel activated pathway of ceramide generation. PMA treatment resulted in transient activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38) followed by dephosphorylation/inactivation. Interestingly, fumonisin B1 (FB1), an inhibitor of the salvage pathway, attenuated loss of phosphorylation of p38, suggesting a role for ceramide in p38 dephosphorylation. This was confirmed by knock-down of longevity-assurance homologue 5, which partially suppressed the formation of C16-ceramide induced by PMA and increased the phosphorylation of p38. These results demonstrate a role for the salvage pathway in feedback inhibition of p38. To determine which protein phosphatases act in this pathway, specific knock-down of serine/threonine protein phosphatases was performed, and it was observed that knock-down of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) catalytic subunits significantly increased p38 phosphorylation, suggesting activation of PP1 results in an inhibitory effect on p38. Moreover, PMA recruited PP1 catalytic subunits to mitochondria, and this was significantly suppressed by FB1. In addition, phospho-p38 resided in PMA-stimulated mitochondria. Upon PMA treatment, a mitochondria-enriched/purified fraction exhibited significant increases in C16-ceramide, a major ceramide specie, which was suppressed by FB1. Taken together, these data suggest that accumulation of C16-ceramide in mitochondria formed from the protein kinase C-dependent salvage pathway results at least in part from the action of longevity-assurance homologue 5, and the generated ceramide modulates the p38 cascade via PP1. Recently we showed that, in human breast cancer cells, activation of protein kinase C by 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) produced ceramide formed from the salvage pathway (Becker, K.

Recently, we also described activation of the “salvage pathway,” which re-utilizes long-chain sphingoid bases (sphingosine and sphinganine) formed by degradation of (dihydro)ceramide or complex sphingolipids (15Becker K.P.

The results showed that PMA, a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, stimulated the generation of ceramide, which was inhibited by treatment with fumonisin B1 (FB1) (20Merrill Jr., A.H. Liotta D.C.

This distinguishes the de novo from the salvage pathway and suggests the utility of FB1 (versus myriocin) in elucidating biological functions of the salvage pathway-derived ceramide in PKC-dependent cell responses. Based on such approaches, ceramide formed from the salvage pathway has been shown to be involved in the inhibition of juxtanuclear translocation of PKC-βII upon PMA treatment, implying a role of ceramide in intracellular signal transduction (15Becker K.P.

Although involvement of ceramide in cell responses has been investigated, further studies are required to understand the detailed mechanisms regarding signal transduction following association of ceramide with the target molecules described above. The activation of the salvage pathway by PKC suggested possible roles for ceramide in regulating some PKC-mediated responses (15Becker K.P. Kitatani K. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2606-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

Some of the best studied are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which include c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2 (JNK1/2), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and p38 (34Seger R.

In contrast, some studies showed that ceramide down-regulated activation of MAPKs (38Kitatani K. Akiba S. Hayama M. Sato T. Arch. Biochem.

These considerations led us to investigate the role of ceramide, specifically generated from the salvage pathway, in regulating protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of members of the MAPK family. In this study, we examined specific roles of ceramide formed from the salvage pathway in signal transduction in PMA-stimulated human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The results demonstrate that 1) PMA activation of the salvage pathway contributes to selective increases in C16-ceramide, which significantly occurred in mitochondria and were at least partly mediated by the activity of longevity-assurance homologue 5 (Lass5), 2) one of the CAPPs, PP1, as well as p38 were relocalized to mitochondria where C16-ceramide was enriched, and 3) this ceramide/PP1 pathway functioned as a negative regulator of the p38 cascade.

Cell Culture—MCF-7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640, supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at <80% confluency under standard incubator conditions (humidified atmosphere, 95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). Subcellular Fractionation by Differential Centrifugation and Mitochondrial Isolation by Continuous Centrifugation Using a Percoll Gradient—Cells were incubated in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min on ice. Cells were disrupted by passage through a 25-gauge needle for 5 strokes and then were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, 10,000 × g for 10 min, and 100,000 × g for 60 min, for collection of the nuclear fraction, mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane fraction, and light membrane fraction, respectively. These membrane fractions were washed twice with the above buffer, and ceramide levels were measured. To isolate mitochondria, the washed heavy membrane fractions were further loaded onto a 30% Percoll solution and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. Each fraction (fraction numbers 1-12) was subjected to immunoblotting with voltage-dependent anion channel (porin) or calnexin to determine fractions of mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. Western Blotting—Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with Halt™ phosphatase inhibitor mixture and then lysed using Laemmli buffer. Proteins (10 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dried milk, washed with PBS-T, and incubated for 12 h with primary antibody in PBS-T containing 5% nonfat dried milk. The blots were washed with PBS-T and incubated with secondary antibody in PBS-T containing 5% nonfat dried milk. Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Transfection with Small Interference RNA—Cells (2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were transfected with double strand siRNAs using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, transfection reagents were washed out and cells were stimulated with PMA in RPM I1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Specific siRNAs for PP2Ac-β (sc-36301) and PP1c-β (sc-36295) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The sequences of siRNAs for human longevity-assurance homologue (LASS) family members, LASS1 and LASS5, were AAGGTCCTGTATGCCACCAGT and AAACCCTGTGCACTCTGTATT, respectively. The other sequences of siRNAs for scrambled RNA, human PP1c-α, and PP1c-γ were AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT, AAGCACGACTTGGACCTCATC, and AAGAGGCAGTTGGTCACTCTG, respectively. Quantitative Real-time PCR—One μg of total RNA, isolated using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen), was used in reverse transcription reactions as described (44Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R.

The resulting total cDNA was then used in the quantitative real-time PCR to measure the mRNA levels using TaqMan® gene expression kit (Applied Biosystems) as described by the manufacturer with ABI 7300 Q-PCR system. The mRNA levels of rRNA were used as internal control. Transfection with FLAG-tagged LASS5 Expression Vector— Cells, growing on glass coverslips, were transfected with 1 μg of pCMVexSVneo-LASS5 plasmid DNA using an Effectine transfection kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Direct Immunofluorescence—Cells, growing on glass coverslips, were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and washed with PBS. Next, cells were treated for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 2% human serum. The primary antibodies for PP1c, Lamin B, HSP60, phospho-p38, calreticulin, FLAG, or cytochrome c were diluted in PBS containing 2% human serum, and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. Samples were washed with PBS, and TRITC- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies were applied for 1 h in PBS containing 2% human serum. Confocal laser microscopy was performed using an LSM510 microscope (Carl Zeiss, New York). LC/MS—Analysis of ceramide species in lipid extract was performed by LC/MS as described in Becker et al. (15Becker K.P. Kitatani K. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2606-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Comparison between two groups was carried out by unpaired or paired Student's t test. Transient Activation of MAPKs and Ceramide-dependent Inactivation upon PMA Treatment—Many reports have shown that PMA induces acute activation of MAPKs in a PKC-dependent manner (32Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar, 35Liebmann C. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 45Tanaka Y. Gavrielides M.V. Mitsuuchi Y. Fujii T. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33753-33762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); this activation is mostly transient, probably because of the action of various protein phosphatases. To determine the contribution of ceramide selectively derived from the salvage pathway to the regulation of MAPKs, MCF-7 cells were initially treated with PMA for up to 8 h, and then MAPK activation was monitored by immunoblotting with antibodies to the phosphorylated/active forms of JNK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38. As shown in Fig. 1, activation of JNK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38 was observed 30 min after PMA treatment and was transient such that by 2 h there was loss of PMA-induced phosphorylation, indicating action of protein phosphatases. To determine if the ceramide generated in response to PMA participates in this dephosphorylation phase of MAPKs, ceramide production was inhibited by the (dihydro)ceramide synthase inhibitor, FB1. The results showed that FB1 enhanced p38 activation induced by PMA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A), and densitometric analysis showed that the effect was statistically significant (Fig. 2B). In contrast, FB1 did not exert a significant effect on the phosphorylation status of JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 (Fig. 2A). In support of these results, exogenous C6-ceramide was also found to exert an inhibitory effect on p38 activation induced by PMA (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2FB1 enhancement of p38 phosphorylation/activation upon PMA treatment. A, mCF-7 cells were pretreated with the indicated concentration of FB1 for 2 h and then stimulated with 100 nm PMA for 1 h. Whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies for specific active forms of JNK1/2, ERK1/2, and p38. B, cells were pretreated with 100 μm FB1 for 2 h and then stimulated with 100 nm PMA for 1 h. Amounts of phospho-p38 were estimated by measuring the density of bands of phospho-p38 and expressed as arbitrary units. Equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. The data represent mean ± S.E. of three values. *, significantly different compared with FB1-untreated control (p < 0.004). **, significantly different compared with PMA stimulation (p < 0.02).

Specific knock-down of the LASS family members, LASS1 (47Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

Each siRNA treatment was confirmed to decrease the levels of the respective mRNA (Fig. 3A). Knock-down of LASS1 or LASS5 evoked a slight increase in basal levels of phospho-p38. Importantly, phosphorylation of p38 upon PMA treatment was markedly increased at the indicated time points in LASS5 knock-down cells as compared with the use of scrambled RNA or LASS1 siRNA (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that LASS5 knock-down had no effects on either the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 (data not shown). In addition, the partial silencing of LASS5 resulted in a commensurate partial inhibition of the generation of C16-ceramide after PMA stimulation (Fig. 3C). Taken together, the results suggest that LASS5 is at least in part involved in the salvage pathway and that LASS5-mediated generation of ceramide then acts to enhance dephosphorylation of p38. Involvement of the PP1 Serine/Threonine Protein Phosphatase in p38 Dephosphorylation—The above results suggested that endogenous ceramide might activate a protein phosphatase in the p38 response. The serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A have been implicated as CAPPs in vitro and as mediators of actions of ceramide on protein dephosphorylation in cells (1Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 4Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 27Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To assess their roles in the ceramide effect on p38, individual isoforms of the catalytic subunits of CAPPs were knocked down by treatment with specific siRNA. The specific effectiveness of the knock-down was confirmed by immunoblotting with antibodies for PP1c-α, PP1c-β, PP1c-γ, and PP2Ac (Fig. 4A). Next, the effects of the siRNA on the PMA-induced phosphorylation of the MAPKs were evaluated. Interestingly, knock-down of each of the PP1c isoforms resulted in mild enhancement of basal phosphorylation of p38, with PP1c-β showing the least effect (Fig. 4B). In PMA-stimulated cells, each of PP1c siRNAs displayed a significant elevation in p38 phosphorylation as well (Fig. 4B), implying that PP1c acts as a negative regulator of the p38 pathway. In contrast, knockdown of PP1c-α and PP1c-β did not show much effect on phosphorylation of JNK1/2 or ERK1/2 induced by PMA, but PP1c-γ knock-down showed modest enhancement of phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and ERK1/2. In contradistinction to PP1 isoforms, knock-down of PP2Ac-β did not modulate the effects of PMA on the phosphorylation status of p38 or the other MAPKs (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results show that PP1c regulates the dephosphorylation of p38 following PMA-induced phosphorylation. Relocalization of PP1c to Mitochondria in Response to PMA—To investigate the spatial association of PP1c with PMA-induced increases in ceramide, the effects of PMA on the intracellular localization of PP1c were examined. For these studies, PP1c was detected by direct immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using an antibody (E9), which recognizes all three isoforms of PP1c (PP1c-α, PP1c-β, and PP1c-γ), and colocalization was determined using antibodies for Lamin B as a nuclear membrane marker or HSP60 as a mitochondrial marker. As shown in Fig. 5, PP1c was present initially in a diffuse cytosolic pattern, but became relocalized to the perinuclear region in response to 1 h of treatment with PMA. Treatment of cells with PMA caused partial colocalization of PP1c with Lamin B; however, the pattern was such that PP1c localized in a ring like pattern partly overlapping but surrounding Lamin B, suggesting extra-nuclear localization (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, PMA not only induced a significant degree of colocalization of most of PP1c with HSP60, but it also induced a redistribution of HSP60, a mitochondrial matrix protein, into the same perinuclear pattern of PP1c (Fig. 5B). Staining with calreticulin, an endoplasmic reticulum protein, exhibited tubules as well as ring-shape structure around the nucleus, but PMA failed to recruit PP1c to the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 5C). Taken together, the results demonstrate dynamic regulation of PP1c localization and association with a perinuclear pool of mitochondria in PMA-stimulated MCF-7 cells. Ceramide-dependent Relocalization of PP1c—To determine if ceramide formation is involved in the relocalization of PP1c, the effects of FB1 were examined, because under these conditions F"

The tumor suppressor function of APC is attributed primarily to its ability to regulate the WNT pathway by targeting the destruction of β-catenin. We report here a novel role for APC in regulating degradation of the transcriptional co-repressor C-terminal-binding protein-1 (CtBP1) through a proteasome-dependent process. Further, CtBP1 suppresses the expression of intestinal retinol dehydrogenases, which are required for retinoic acid production and intestinal differentiation. In support of a role for CtBP1 in initiation of colorectal cancer, adenomas taken from individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis contain high levels of CtBP1 protein in comparison with matched, uninvolved tissue. The relationship between APC and CtBP1 is conserved between humans and zebrafish and provides a mechanistic model explaining APC control of intestinal retinoic acid biosynthesis.

Smits R. Clevers H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which APC mutations cause colon tumorigenesis is attributed primarily to its role in negatively regulating canonical WNT signaling (2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851PubMed Google Scholar, 3Radtke F. Clevers H. Science. 2005; 307: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In this role, APC functions by targeting the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin for intracellular degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway, thereby limiting its ability to associate with T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor nuclear transcription factors. Current evidence indicates that following APC mutation, β-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleus, where it partners with T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factors to drive a program of cellular proliferation. As evidence for a genetic relationship between APC and WNT signaling, some studies cite the existence of rare, β-catenin-activating mutations in colon adenocarcinomas (4Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3465) Google Scholar, 5Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4624-4630PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, however, these mutations do not appear to fully recapitulate the clinical phenotypes associated with APC mutation (6Samowitz W.S. Powers M.D. Spirio L.N. Nollet F. van Roy F. Slattery M.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1442-1444PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy raises the possibility of additional, β-catenin-independent functions for APC. A number of reports suggest that the functions of APC are not limited to its well established role in regulating canonical WNT signaling. For example, APC is reported to bind to microtubules, to regulate asymmetric cell division in Drosophila male germline stem cells, and to promote proper T-cell differentiation in mice (7Munemitsu S. Souza B. Muller O. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3676-3681PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gounari F. Chang R. Cowan J. Guo Z. Dose M. Gounaris E. Khazaie K. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Further, we recently demonstrated that sporadic human colorectal carcinomas lack retinol dehydrogenases and that introduction of APC into human colon carcinoma cells lines induced the expression of the retinol dehydrogenase DHRS9 in a β-catenin-independent manner (12Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, apcmcr zebrafish lack expression of intestinal enzymes, such as rdh1l, that are required for retinoic acid production. Injection of apcmcr zebrafish embryos with mRNA encoding rdh1l or treatment with exogenous RA partially rescued markers of intestinal differentiation in apcmcr embryos (13Nadauld L.D. Shelton D.N. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). Although these findings support the notion that APC contributes to intestinal differentiation by stimulating retinoic acid production, the mechanism underlying this regulation remains undefined. In this respect, Hamada and Bienz (14Hamada F. Bienz M. Dev Cell. 2004; 7: 677-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) recently provided evidence for a direct binding interaction between APC and the transcriptional co-repressor CtBP1 that occurs in Drosophila melanogaster and in human cells. CtBP1 plays a critical role in regulating gene expression patterns throughout development and in oncogenesis (15Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). CtBP1 regulates target gene transcription, in part, via recruitment of histone deacetylases involved in gene silencing (16Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Lu J.R. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Turner J. Crossley M. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, CtBP1 co-purifies with components of histone-modifying complexes and factors such as LSD1, a reported H3K4 histone demethylase, thereby suggesting that CtBP1 may act to coordinate histone modifications that regulate gene expression (18Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Given the role of CtBP1 in transcriptional repression and its physical interaction with APC, we considered a model wherein APC promotes RA biosynthesis by relieving CtBP1-mediated suppression of retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) expression. Here, we found that CtBP1 levels are high in human FAP adenomas when compared with uninvolved tissues. Reintroduction of APC into human colon carcinoma cell lines caused a proteasome-dependent degradation of CtBP1. APC-mediated destruction of CtBP1 was paralleled by increased expression of the retinol dehydrogenase, DHRS9. This increase was recapitulated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of CtBP1. Finally, our studies showed that apcmcr zebrafish express abnormally high levels of Ctbp1 protein. Restoration of Apc or targeted knockdown of Ctbp1 in apcmcr zebrafish embryos restored expression of rdh1l, as well as markers of intestinal differentiation. These findings support a genetic model wherein APC controls retinoic acid biosynthesis and intestinal differentiation, in part by negatively regulating the levels of CtBP1. Western Blotting and Antibody—Human colon adenomas and matched uninvolved tissue were harvested in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mg/ml phenanthroline. Zebrafish embryos were collected at 54 or 72 hpf and homogenized in SDS lysis buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 3.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate) and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). All lysates were boiled for 10 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Protein lysates were quantified using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein from each sample were fractionated through Tris-glycine 4-12% gradient NuPAGE gels using the MES buffer system (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-CtBP1 (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-CtBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-β-catenin (Sigma), mouse anti-β-actin (Novus biologicals), and mouse anti-vinculin (Sigma). Zebrafish Stocks and Embryo Culture—Wild-type and apcmcr Danio rerio (zebrafish) were maintained on a 14-h:10-h light: dark cycle. apcmcr zebrafish were a kind gift of Drs. Anna Pavlina-Haramis and Hans Clevers. Fertilized embryos were collected following natural spawnings and allowed to develop at 28.5 °C. All embryos were raised in 0.003% phenylthiourea to inhibit pigment formation (19Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar). Whole Mount in Situ Hybridizations—Zebrafish embryos were fixed in sucrose-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in PBS, dehydrated in methanol, and stored at -20 °C. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes for rdh1l, trypsin, and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein i-fabp were generated as reported previously (20Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whole mount in situ hybridizations were carried out as described (20Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Embryos were cleared in 70% glycerol in PBS and photographed using an Olympus DP12 digital camera. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was harvested using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using the Roche LightCycler instrument and software, version 3.5 (Roche Diagnostics). Primers for DHRS9 were reported previously (12Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Primers for zebrafish rdh1l and trypsin were reported previously (13Nadauld L.D. Shelton D.N. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). Primers for E-cadherin and i-fabp were as follows: E-cadherin: forward, 5′-TGCCCAGAAAATGAA AAAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTGTATGTGGCAATGCGTTC-3′; i-fabp: forward, 5′-ATGACCTTCAACGGGACCTGGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TTAAGCCCTCTTGAAAATCCTC-3′. PCR reactions were performed in duplicate using the Light-Cycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). PCR conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of amplification with 10-s denaturation at 95 °C, 5-s annealing at 58 °C, and 10-s extension at 72 °C. A template-free negative control was included in each experiment. siRNA Knock-out of CtBP1 and β-Catenin—For silencing of CtBP1, the sequences of the small interfering RNAs were as follows: sense, 5′-GGG AGG ACC UGG AGA AGU UdTdG-3′; antisense, 5′-dGdTCCC UCC UGG ACC UCU UCAA-3′. For silencing of β-catenin, the sequence of the small interfering RNAs were as follows: sense, 5′-AAU GCU UGG UUC ACC AGU GGA TT-3′; antisense, 5′-UCC ACU GGU GAA CCA AGC AUU TT-3′. The sequence for the control siRNA was as follows: sense, 5′-AGA CAG AAG ACA GAU AGG CTT-3′; antisense, 5′-GCC UAU CUG UCU UCU GUC UTT-3′. Transfection experiments were performed using LipoFectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Following transfection with 50 or 100 nm siRNA, cells were incubated for 24-48 h and then harvested for Western blotting analysis or RT-PCR. In some cases, after transfection, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (20 μm) or a vehicle control (Me2SO) for 10-20 h prior to harvesting. Immunofluorescence—Staining of human tissues was performed on 7-um-thick, paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed sections. Sections were deparaffinized in xylenes and rehydrated in graded alcohols and then permeabilized for 15 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling for 20 min in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, followed by cooling for 20 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated in blocking buffer (2% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated in wash buffer (0.2% goat serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm glycine in 1× PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody (mouse anti-CtBP1, BD Biosciences, diluted 1:100 in PBS) was applied overnight at 4 °C. Sections were rinsed twice in PBS and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse Alexa 488, Molecular Probes; dilution 1:250) and the nuclear stain TOPRO-3 (Molecular Probes; dilution 1:2000). Sections were rinsed in water, and coverslips were applied using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent images were collected using an Olympus FluoView FV300 confocal laser scanning microscope. Retrovirus Infections and Luciferase Assays—Portions of APC were cloned into the pLenti6/UbC/V5-DEST lentiviral expression vector using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). Expression vectors were transfected with ViraPower packaging mix into 293FT cells using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). 72 h after transfection, virus containing medium was collected, filtered, and transferred to HT29 cells at an approximate multiplicity of infection of 1.0. 48 h following infection, total RNA was collected using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total protein was harvested as described above. For luciferase assays, luciferase values were analyzed using a Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by dividing the firefly luciferase activity by the Renilla luciferase activity for each sample. All experiments were performed at least three times. Morpholino and Microinjection Experiment—Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC. The ctbp1MO splicing blocking morpholino (5′-TCC TTA TGA CGA TAC CTT CTC ATG G-3′) and control morpholino (5′-CCT CTT ACC TCA GTT ACA ATT TAT A-3′) were solubilized to a final concentration of 1.0 mm in 1× Danieau buffer. For microinjections, 0.5 nl of a 1.0 mm solution was injected into zebrafish embryos at the one-to-two cell stage. For APC955-2075 and APC1-985 microinjections, 10 pg of plasmid DNA were injected at the one cell stage. Our previous studies have shown that induction of APC in the colorectal carcinoma cell line HT29 stimulated increased expression of DHRS9 (12Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether CtBP1 protein levels are regulated by the APC tumor suppressor in this context, we utilized the engineered human colon carcinoma cell lines, HT29-APC and HT29-β-galactosidase. These cell lines express either wild-type APC or β-galactosidase upon the addition of ZnCl2, respectively (21Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates from cells treated with or without ZnCl2 revealed that APC induction resulted in decreased levels of CtBP1 protein in comparison with cells with induction of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1A). Further, when cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (20 μm) following APC induction, CtBP1 levels accumulated (Fig. 1A). Given the well described role for APC in regulating the WNT/β-catenin pathway, we considered the possibility that reduction of CtBP1 levels following APC induction was dependent on β-catenin. To test this, we transfected two different colon tumor cell lines, HCT116 and HT29, with control or β-catenin-targeted siRNAs. Western blot analyses revealed that although this approach effectively knocked down β-catenin levels, the levels of CtBP1 protein remained unchanged (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR for DHRS9 expression following β-catenin knockdown in parallel cultures showed no change in the expression level of DHRS9 (Fig. 1C). Functional knockdown of β-catenin was confirmed by co-transfection with a TOP-FLASH reporter construct. In each case, knockdown of β-catenin decreased activation of the reporter TOP-FLASH approximately 4-fold. The control siRNA showed no effect on TOP-FLASH expression (data not shown). Since CtBP1 levels appeared dependent on APC and the proteasome, but independent of β-catenin, we sought to determine whether the repression of RDHs in APC mutant human colon tumor cells occurs via CtBP1. Thus, we transfected control and CtBP1 directed siRNAs into three colon carcinoma cell lines that carry APC mutations (DLD-1, SW480, HT29). Western blot analysis revealed that the CtBP1 siRNA effectively knocked down CtBP1 protein in comparison with control treated cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast to knockdown ofβ-catenin, however, RT-PCR analysis indicated robust induction of DHRS9 transcription following CtBP1 knockdown in each of the cell lines tested (Fig. 2B). As an additional approach to testing whether APC controls the levels of CtBP1 and DHRS9, we prepared two deletion constructs of APC for expression in APC-deficient colon tumor cell lines via retroviral transduction. The first construct, APC955-2075 (amino acids 955-2075), contains all of the sites described as necessary for binding CtBP1 (14Hamada F. Bienz M. Dev Cell. 2004; 7: 677-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The second, APC1-985, contains primarily the N terminus of APC (amino acids 1-985) and lacks all reported CtBP1 binding motifs (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis of lysates from HT290 cells infected with lentivirus expressing each protein revealed that introduction of APC955-2075 effectively reduced CtBP1 levels and that expression of APC1-985 had no effect (Fig. 3B). As expected, β-catenin levels were also decreased by introduction of the APC955-2075 construct (Fig. 3B). RT-PCR analysis of DHRS9 transcript levels in this same experiment indicated that concomitant with reducing CtBP1 levels, APC955-2075, but not APC1-985, induced DHRS9 transcript levels ∼4.3-fold (Fig. 3C). Given that APC appears to regulate CtBP1 levels in colon carcinoma cell lines, we next asked whether adenomas taken from FAP patients would accordingly harbor higher levels of CtBP1 when compared with uninvolved tissue. We obtained biopsies of colon adenomas, as well as matched uninvolved tissues from patients that carry germ-line APC mutations and performed Western blot analysis for CtBP1. In six adenomas taken from four different patients, we observed higher CtBP1 levels than in matched uninvolved tissue (Fig. 4A). In addition, immunofluorescence staining of CtBP in an additional five FAP patients revealed high levels of nuclear CtBP1 in adenomas when compared with matched normal tissue (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, in 10 samples from FAP patients, we analyzed DHRS9 levels by RT-PCR and determined that 8 of 10 adenomas expressed reduced levels of DHRS9 in comparison with matched uninvolved tissues (Fig. 4C). The findings in human cell lines and FAP adenomas suggest a relationship between APC and CtBP1. Recent studies have reported that homozygous apc mutant and morphant zebrafish embryos harbor a number of developmental defects consistent with loss of retinoic acid including failed pectoral fin development, underdeveloped jaws, and pancreatic and intestinal differentiation defects (12Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Nadauld L.D. Shelton D.N. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, adult zebrafish carrying heterozygous apc mutations develop spontaneous adenomas in the liver, pancreas, and intestine (22Haramis A.P. van der Hurlstone A. Velden Y. Begthel H. van den Born M. Offerhaus G.J. Clevers H.C. EMBO Rep. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the relationship between Apc and Ctbp1 in vivo using apcmcr zebrafish. When compared with wild-type siblings, apcmcr zebrafish expressed higher levels of Ctbp1 protein, whereas Ctbp1 transcript levels remained unchanged (Fig. 5A and data not shown). We also observed that apcmcr harbored increased β-catenin levels when compared with wild-type siblings (Fig. 5A). To determine whether Ctbp1 protein levels were dependent on Apc, we sought to restore Apc function in mutant zebrafish by injecting mRNA encoding APC955-2075, the region that, in human cells, caused degradation of CtBP1 (14Hamada F. Bienz M. Dev Cell. 2004; 7: 677-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similar to that seen in human cells above, APC955-2075 caused a strong reduction of Ctbp1 protein levels (Fig. 5B). As expected, β-catenin levels were also decreased following injection of APC955-2075 (Fig. 5B). In contrast to APC955-2075, injection of APC1-985 had no effect on Ctbp1 or β-catenin levels (Fig. 5B). In parallel injections, quantitative RT-PCR revealed that expression of the DHRS9 homolog in zebrafish, rdh1l, was induced in apcmcr following injection of APC955-2075. This was also the case for markers of pancreas (trypsin) and intestinal (i-fabp) differentiation (Fig. 5C). Again, injection of APC1-985 had no effect (data not shown). The above findings suggested that intestinal differentiation in apcmcr zebrafish was repressed by the accumulation of either β-catenin or Ctbp1. To further examine this issue, we first attempted to reduce levels of β-catenin. As antisense morpholino constructs directed against β-catenin showed severe toxicity prior to gut development (data not shown), we reduced levels of β-catenin by treatment with the selective COX2 inhibitor NS-398. Consistent with our previous finding of elevated COX-2 in apcmcr zebrefish (23Eisinger A.L. Nadauld L.D. Shelton D.N. Peterson P.W. Phelps R.A. Chidester S. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20474-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and recent studies showing PGE2-induced activation of β-catenin (24Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 25Shao J. Jung C. Liu C. Sheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), treatment of apc-mcr embryos with NS-398 effectively reduced the levels of β-catenin (Fig. 6A). However, RT-PCR analysis revealed that this reduction in β-catenin protein levels failed to induce the expression of rdh1l, i-fabp, and trypsin (Fig. 6B). This suggested suppression of these markers by increased levels of Ctbp. To address this possibility, we knocked down Ctbp1 by injecting a Ctbp1-targeted antisense morpholino oligonucleotide that specifically blocked splicing of the Ctbp1 transcript. Injection of the Ctbp1-targeted antisense morpholino resulted in substantial reduction in Ctbp1 protein as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7A). Injection of a control antisense morpholino caused no change in Ctbp1 levels (Fig. 7A). As seen in human cell lines, knockdown of Ctbp1 showed no effect on β-catenin or actin protein levels (Fig. 7A). Having established that the Ctbp1 morpholino effectively reduced Ctbp1 splicing (data not shown), we examined rdh1l expression in apcmcr injected with the Ctbp1 antisense morpholino. As observed in human cells, this analysis revealed that in comparison with control-injected embryos, knockdown of Ctbp1 rescued rdh1l expression in a significant proportion of apcmcr embryos (Fig. 7, B and C). Further, we observed restoration of trypsin and i-fabp expression in a similar fraction of apcmcr injected with Ctbp1 morpholino (Fig. 7, B and C). In this report, we employ human cell lines and tissues, as well as a vertebrate model system to expose a novel role for APC in regulating intracellular levels of the transcriptional co-repressor CtBP1. Our studies also indicate that CtBP1 dictates the expression of retinoic acid biosynthetic enzymes, as well as intestinal differentiation. The ability of APC to regulate CtBP1 occurs independently of β-catenin and relies upon degradation mediated by the proteasome. Our findings are consistent with a model wherein APC regulates the stability of both β-catenin (14Hamada F. Bienz M. Dev Cell. 2004; 7: 677-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and CtBP1. This allows simultaneous negative regulation of Wnt signaling while stimulating retinoic acid biosynthesis during intestinal cell differentiation. Evidence for this model includes: i) expression of wild-type APC in APC mutant human cells or zebrafish rescues expression of RA biosynthetic enzymes such as DHRS9 and rdh1l; ii) knockdown of CtBP1 in APC-deficient human cells and in apcmcr zebrafish restores expression of DHRS9 and rdh1l, respectively; iii) injection of a ctbp1 morpholino in apcmcr zebrafish rescues RA-deficient differentiation defects including the expression of the markers i-fabp and trypsin; iv) siRNA against β-catenin in human cells had no effect on CtBP1 levels, and v) human colon polyps from FAP patients harbored increased CtBP1 and decreased DHRS9. Our data indicate that reintroduction of wild-type APC into APC-deficient human colon tumor cells or injection of wild-type APC into apcmcr zebrafish results in decreased ctbp1 protein levels and that in human cells, this decrease was blocked by inhibition of the proteasome. It appears, therefore, that APC control of both CtBP1 and β-catenin shares common features. In both cases, APC is reported to bind these proteins directly, and in both cases, APC inhibits the accumulation of these two transcriptional regulators. Second, APC regulation of CtBP1 and β-catenin protein levels is dependent upon the proteasome (26Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Several reports indicate that phosphorylation of β-catenin by the APC complex is required for proteasomal degradation (26Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Likewise, recent studies indicate that CtBP1 is destroyed by the proteasome in cells responding to stimuli such as UV irradiation and that phosphorylation and ubiquitination of CtBP1 are required for proteolysis to occur (28Zhang Q. Yoshimatsu Y. Hildebrand J. Frisch S.M. Goodman R.H. Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 29Zhang Q. Nottke A. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, although current models assign to APC a role in controlling intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation by regulating the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin, our results assign to APC a simultaneous role in contributing to intestinal cell differentiation by regulating the transcriptional co-repressor CtBP1. These results support the hypothesis that in the setting of APC mutations, both β-catenin and CtBP1 accumulate, with each contributing to impaired intestinal cell differentiation. Importantly, this model may reconcile apparent clinical incongruities indicating that colon adenocarcinomas bearing APC mutations differ from those carrying only β-catenin-activating mutations (6Samowitz W.S. Powers M.D. Spirio L.N. Nollet F. van Roy F. Slattery M.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1442-1444PubMed Google Scholar). For example, lesions carrying stabilizing β-catenin mutations may retain retinoic acid production, thereby limiting tumor growth. Although APC appears to regulate both β-catenin and CtBP1 similarly, levels of CtBP1 do not appear to be dependent on β-catenin. This is indicated by the finding that siRNA knockdown of β-catenin showed no corresponding effect on CtBP1 levels. The regulation of CtBP1 by APC is, therefore, consistent with recent reports detailing a β-catenin-independent role for APC in controlling retinoic acid production in humans and in zebrafish (12Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Nadauld L.D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, these findings are consistent with reports describing roles for APC that are considered non-canonical with respect to its classical role in controlling β-catenin (7Munemitsu S. Souza B. Muller O. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3676-3681PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gounari F. Chang R. Cowan J. Guo Z. Dose M. Gounaris E. Khazaie K. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For example, APC appears important in stabilization of microtubule polymerization, thereby helping to guide the formation of microtubule networks (8Nathke I.S. Adams C.L. Polakis P. Sellin J.H. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 9Zumbrunn J. Kinoshita K. Hyman A.A. Nathke I.S. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 44-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition, APC plays a role in regulating asymmetric cell division in male germ line stem cells by orienting mitotic spindles during stem cell division (10Yamashita Y.M. Jones D.L. Fuller M.T. Science. 2003; 301: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Finally, T-cell differentiation in the mouse requires β-catenin-independent actions of APC (11Gounari F. Chang R. Cowan J. Guo Z. Dose M. Gounaris E. Khazaie K. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CtBP1 is a well described transcriptional co-repressor that represses gene expression, in part, by recruiting histone deacetylases to gene promoters (16Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Lu J.R. Olson E.N. J.

In addition, tagged purification of CtBP1 proteins has recently revealed that these proteins assemble into large chromatin-modifying complexes (18Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Further, a recent report has implicated APC in targeting of CTBP1 to sites of repression as a WNT antagonist (30Sierra J. Yoshida T. Joazeiro C.A. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These findings, coupled with our report that APC controls CtBP1 levels, suggest that APC may act to direct intestinal cell differentiation by regulating the stability of chromatin remodeling complexes. Interestingly, Jette et al. (12Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported the regulation of human DHRS9 by the intestinal-specific transcription factor CDX2. CDX2, however, is present in adenomas and carcinomas bearing APC mutations (31Qualtrough D. Hinoi T. Fearon E. Paraskeva C. Gut. 2002; 51: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The accumulation of CtBP1, which suppresses RDH expression, could explain the failed activation of DHRS9 in FAP tissues despite the presence of CDX2. Studies in Drosophila and Xenopus suggest that CtBP can act, via Brinker and xTcf-3, to antagonize Wg/WNT signaling (32Saller E. Kelley A. Bienz M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, many studies cite constitutive WNT signaling as a driving force in colon tumorigenesis (2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851PubMed Google Scholar, 3Radtke F. Clevers H. Science. 2005; 307: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, our findings suggest that loss of APC, a negative regulator of the WNT pathway, results in high CtBP1 levels in human colonic adenomas. However, CtBP1 has been reported to both activate and repress gene transcription in a context-specific manner (34Phippen T.M. Sweigart A.L. Moniwa M. Krumm A. Davie J.R. Parkhurst S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37628-37637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Fang M. Li J. Blauwkamp T. Bhambhani C. Campbell N. Cadigan K.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2735-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Further, murine embryonic knock-out of CtBP2 results in decreased expression of the Wnt3a target gene, brachyury, suggesting that CtBP2 may serve in vivo as an activator of this Wnt target gene (36Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5296-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that CtBP has diverse functions that are defined by multiple contributing factors. In conclusion, our results suggest that accumulation of CtBP1 following APC mutation represses intestinal cell differentiation and that elimination of CtBP1 promotes a program of differentiation. Further, these data support the existence of this pathway in zebrafish and humans and provide evidence for CtBP1 dysregulation in human adenomas, coincident with a loss of RA biosynthetic capabilities due to the absence of RDH expression. These results draw attention to the necessity of continued research into non-canonical roles for APC and suggest that inhibition of canonical WNT signaling alone may not effectively restore intestinal differentiation in APC-deficient tissues.

Here we demonstrate that the capsid (CA) protein of HIV-1 is more rapidly degraded in cells expressing monkey TRIM5α than in cells expressing human TRIM5α. Other proteins encoded by Gag and Pol are not subject to TRIM5α-mediated accelerated degradation. The accelerated CA degradation by TRIM5α apparently occurs via a nonproteosomal pathway. TRIM5α selectively accelerates degradation of the CA population, which reached the cytosol of restrictive cells, but not the CA population, which ended into the vesicular compartment. Given that cytosolic CA represents “productively” entered cores, whereas vesicular CA represents “nonproductively” entered cores, our findings suggest that TRIM5α interrupts the infectious pathway of HIV-1 by acting on the incoming cytosolic CA. The mode of viral entry does not influence the accelerated degradation of cytosolic CA by TRIM5α.

CA core has to undergo a series of critical events following its delivery into the host cell. These events include the breakdown of the shell of CA that surrounds the viral RNA (uncoating), the conversion of the viral RNA into DNA (reverse transcription), migration of the viral DNA to the nucleus (nuclear import), and ultimately the insertion of the viral DNA into the host chromosomes (integration). Because HIV-1 encounters a block in monkey cells after entry but prior to integration, it has been speculated that monkeys contain factors that interfere with HIV-1 uncoating and/or reverse transcription (1Shibata R. Sakai H. Kawamura M. Tokunaga K. Adachi A. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Towers G.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 2005; 16: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The first monkey restriction factor was identified, the Rhesus monkey (RhM) TRIM5α (8Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Interfering with RhMTRIM5α expression in monkey cells abolishes HIV-1 restriction (8Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of RhMTRIM5α in human cells, which are normally permissive to HIV-1, restricts HIV-1 (8Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Humans (Hu) also express TRIM5α, which, although 87% identical in amino acid sequence to RhMTRIM5α, weakly restricts HIV-1 because of substitutions in the C terminus (8Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 11Song B. Gold B. O'Huigin C. Javanbakht H. Li X. Stremlau M. Winkler C. Dean M. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Anti-HIV-1 restriction activities have been attributed to other monkey TRIM5 proteins such as African green and spider monkey TRIM5α proteins (12Hatziioannou T. Perez-Caballero D. Yang A. Cowan S. Bieniasz P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10774-10779Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 15Song B. Javanbakht H. Perron M. Park D.H. Stremlau M. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3930-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Moreover, a unique form of TRIM5 exists in owl monkeys, TRIM5-CypA, which also restricts HIV-1 and which results from the retrotransposition of a cyclophilin A (CypA) pseudogene into the TRIM5 locus (16Sayah D.M. Sokolskaja E. Berthoux L. Luban J. Nature. 2004; 430: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 17Nisole S. Lynch C. Stoye J.P. Yap M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13324-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, monkey TRIM5α and TRIM5-CypA proteins represent a novel class of intracellular innate immunity factors that arrest HIV-1 during the early steps of infection. Swapping HIV-1 CA for RhM CA renders HIV-1 capable of infecting RhM cells (18Owens C.M. Yang P.C. Gottlinger H. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, CA mutations alter the sensitivity of HIV-1 to TRIM5α in monkey cells (19Kootstra N.A. Munk C. Tonnu N. Landau N.R. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1298-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Chatterji U. Bobardt M.D. Stanfield R. Ptak R.G. Pallansch L.A. Ward P.A. Jones M.J. Stoddart C.A. Scalfaro P. Dumont J.M.

This suggests that the CA encodes the determinants for TRIM5α restriction. However, although it is clearly established that TRIM5α and TRIM5-CypA block HIV-1 after viral entry but before integration (1Shibata R. Sakai H. Kawamura M. Tokunaga K. Adachi A. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 8Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), it is still poorly understood how these restriction factors interrupt the virus pathway. We thus investigated the mechanisms that control the block in HIV-1 infectivity by TRIM5α. Specifically, we asked whether monkey TRIM5α and TRIM5-CypA block HIV-1 infection by diverting the incoming CA core from the infective pathway into an abortive degradation pathway. Viruses and Infections—The pNL4.3-GFP plasmid was provided by C. Aiken and D. Gabuzda. The G89V CA-GFP mutant was generated by PCR mutagenesis (24Chatterji U. Bobardt M.D. Stanfield R. Ptak R.G.

NL4.3 Env minus plasmid was provided by C. Aiken. Viruses were generated by transfection of 293T cells using GeneJuice (EMD Biosciences, Inc., Novagen). Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection and filtered through a 0.2-μm pore size filter. Viral inoculum was standardized by exoRT assay or p24 ELISA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HeLa-HuTRIM5 and HeLa-RhMTRIM5 were provided by J. Sodroski (8Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar), and OMK cells were provided by G. Towers and C. Aiken. The pcDNA-CD4 plasmid provided by M. Goldsmith was used to create stable CD4+ HeLa-HuTRIM5 and -Rh-MTRIM5 cell lines. Debio-025 was provided by DEBIOPHARM. Debio-025 (2 μm) was added 15 min prior to virus addition. Infected cells were analyzed by FACS (GFP content) 48 h post-infection. For saturation experiments, OMK cells were initially exposed to increasing amounts of virus that does not encode GFP and subsequently (5 min later) exposed to wild-type HIV-1 that does encode GFP. Degradation Analysis of Incoming HIV-1 Components in Infected Cells—Cells were exposed to HIV-1 (25, 100, and 250 ng of p24) for 1 h at 4 °C to permit virus attachment and washed extensively to remove unbound virus to synchronize subsequent virus internalization. We synchronized viral internalization to avoid a continuous entry of viruses that would interfere with the interpretation of the degradation results. For each experiment, we verified that similar amounts of virus were initially attached onto the surface of target cells by Western blot and ELISA (data not shown). After washes to remove unattached virus, cells were placed at 37 °C for subsequent viral internalization. After different time points, cells were trypsinized and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for whole lysate isolation. Nuclear extracts were discarded by centrifugation. Whole lysates were standardized for protein concentration and analyzed for viral content by Western blot. Cytosolic and vesicular extracts from infected cells were isolated as described previously (30Marechal V. Clavel F. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After Dounce homogenization (16 strokes, 2 ml B pestle), nuclei and cell debris were spun down at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and resulting post-nuclear fraction (PNF) was spun at 41,000 rpm at 4 °C for 18 min in an SW41 Ti rotor. PNF supernatant corresponding to the “cytosolic fraction” was carefully collected, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (20% trichloroacetic acid final) on ice for 30 min, and spun in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Pellet was washed twice with 200 μl of ice-cold acetone, dried at 95 °C for 5-10 min, and resuspended in SDS loading buffer. PNF pellet corresponding to the “vesicular fraction” was directly resuspended in SDS loading buffer. Anti-HIV-1 protein polyclonal antibodies were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health, and rabbit anti-CypA serum was obtained by immunization with recombinant human CypA protein (24Chatterji U. Bobardt M.D. Stanfield R. Ptak R.G. Pallansch L.A. Ward P.A. Jones M.J. Stoddart C.A. Scalfaro P. Dumont J.M. Besseghir K. Rosenwirth B. Gallay P.A. J. Biol.

The anti-CA polyclonal antibody (HIV-1 SF2 p24 antiserum) recognizes wild-type and G89V capsids equally well (24Chatterji U. Bobardt M.D. Stanfield R. Ptak R.G. Pallansch L.A. Ward P.A. Jones M.J.

Real time PCR analysis was performed as described previously (31Corbeil J. Sheeter D. Genini D. Rought S. Leoni L. Du P. Ferguson M. Masys D.R. Welsh J.B. Fink J.L. Sasik R. Huang D. Drenkow J. Richman D.D. Gingeras T. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Amplification efficiencies were validated and normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fold increases were calculated using the Comparative CT Method for quantitation. The proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin (EMD Biosciences, Inc., Calbiochem) were added to target cells 30 min before infection at 25 and 20 μm, respectively. Accelerated Degradation of Incoming HIV-1 CA in TRIM5α+ Restrictive Cells—We first sought conditions where TRIM5α exhibits potent inhibitory effect on HIV-1 infection. To address this issue, we infected cells that highly restrict HIV-1 such as HeLa cells that express RhMTRIM5α (HeLa-RhMTRIM5) or that poorly restrict HIV-1 such as HeLa cells that express human TRIM5α (HeLa-HuTRIM5) (8Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The introduction of RhMTRIM5α in HeLa cells (HeLa-RhMTRIM5), but not HuTRIM5α (HeLa-HuTRIM5), impairs the capacity of HIV-1 to infect these cells (Fig. 1A). Note that HIV-1 infects successfully and similarly parental HeLa and HeLa-HuTRIM5 cells (data not shown), suggesting that HuTRIM5α fails to restrict HIV-1 and thus represents an ideal control for RhMTRIM5α. Even high doses of HIV-1 barely infect restrictive HeLa-RhMTRIM5 cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that RhMTRIM5α, but not HuTRIM5α, is a potent restriction factor against HIV-1 and that HeLa-RhMTRIM5 cells are adequate to analyze the fate of incoming CA in restrictive cells. The nature of the viral envelope (gp120 or VSVG) does not influence the degree of RhMTRIM5α-mediated restriction (Fig. 1A). To determine whether TRIM5α blocks HIV-1 infection by targeting the incoming CA core for degradation, we examined the degradation status of HIV-1 CA in whole lysate as well as of other viral components in both restrictive and nonrestrictive cells during the early steps of infection. HIV-1 matrix (MA), which is delivered in the cytoplasm of target cells during the early steps of infection, is slowly but significantly degraded over time in both nonrestrictive and restrictive cells (Fig. 1B). In nonrestrictive cells, CA also undergoes a slow but significant degradation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, in restrictive cells, CA undergoes an accelerated degradation (Fig. 1B). To quantitatively evaluate the degradation rate of CA in whole lysate, we measured amounts of CA by ELISA. Supporting our Western blot data (Fig. 1B), the CA degradation is accelerated in restrictive cells (Fig. 1C). We observed that CA degradation in whole lysate is constantly more obvious by Western blot analysis than by p24 ELISA. This is certainly because of the fact that ELISA can detect intact, partially, and even largely degraded CA (peptides), whereas Western blot mainly detects intact CA. We verified that similar amounts of whole lysates were analyzed by comparing levels of CypA (Fig. 1B). Note that the same blot was successively probed with antibodies directed against various viral and cellular proteins. Our observation that the equally abundant incoming HIV-1 protein, MA, undergoes only slow degradation in restrictive cells, whereas CA undergoes rapid degradation (Fig. 1, B and C), suggests that CA is preferentially targeted for degradation in restrictive cells. These findings reveal a correlation between RhMTRIM5α-mediated HIV-1 restriction and an accelerated degradation of incoming CA. Surprisingly, reverse transcriptase (Fig. 1B), nucleocapsid (data not shown), and viral RNA (Fig. 1D) undergo only a slow but significant degradation in whole lysates of both nonrestrictive and restrictive cells. These findings suggest that, although incoming CA is selectively targeted for degradation in restrictive cells, the integrity of the inner core components is preserved. We observed that CA undergoes a more dramatic degradation in restrictive cells when the viral inoculum is low (data not shown), probably because of the fact that when less CA enters the cell, less CA is present to saturate the restriction factor. On the other hand, the inoculum needs to be sufficiently high to detect CA within the target cell by Western blot. We thus had to use three virus concentrations for each experiment. It is also important to note that although we observed some differences in the degree of CA degradation between experiments, we always observed a significant and reproducible difference in the threshold of CA degradation between restrictive and nonrestrictive cells, supporting the notion that TRIM5α-mediated restriction correlates with accelerated CA degradation. TRIM5α Accelerates Degradation of the CA Population Delivered into the Cytosol of Target Cells That Is Normally Associated with Productive Viral Entry—We showed that incoming CA is more rapidly degraded in restrictive than in nonrestrictive cells. However, what we examined was the degradation status of CA in whole lysate and not the cytosolic CA population that has been shown to contain authentic infectious cores associated with productive entry (“productively” entered cores) (30Marechal V. Clavel F. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether TRIM5α-mediated restriction correlates with selective degradation of cytosolic CA. In both nonrestrictive and restrictive cells, CA accumulates in the vesicular compartment and then disappears (Fig. 2a). Our data indicate that the CA population, which ends into the vesicular compartment, undergoes degradation. This supports the notion that CA delivered into the vesicular compartment represents abortive infectious events (“nonproductively” entered cores) (30Marechal V. Clavel F. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because a similar pattern of degradation of vesicular CA is observed in both nonrestrictive and restrictive cells (Fig. 2a), this suggests that TRIM5α does not exert its restriction effect by acting on vesicular CA. In sharp contrast, the CA population delivered into the cytosol of nonrestrictive cells remains perfectly intact even 4 h post-infection, whereas it undergoes degradation in restrictive cells (Fig. 2a). This indicates that RhMTRIM5α accelerates degradation of the cytosolic CA population, which represents the productively entered cores. The CA degradation rate quantified by p24 ELISA or by Western blot analysis correlates well (Fig. 2, right graphs). We examined the subcellular localization of TRIM5α and found it mainly cytosolic (Fig. 2d), suggesting that the restriction factor is well positioned to recognize incoming cores as soon as they are delivered into the cytosol. Because we found TRIM5α and CypA mainly cytosolic (not in the vesicular compartment), this demonstrates that our subcellular fractionation works properly. Our finding that RhMTRIM5α-mediated restriction correlates with degradation of cytosolic CA further supports the notion that cytosolic CA represents productively entered cores, whereas vesicular CA represents nonproductively entered cores (30Marechal V. Clavel F. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2208-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that vesicular CA is similarly degraded in restrictive and nonrestrictive cells, whereas cytosolic CA is more rapidly degraded in restrictive than in nonrestrictive cells, suggests that the TRIM5α-mediated accelerated CA degradation we observed above in whole extracts (Fig. 1) mainly arose from cytosolic CA degradation rather than vesicular CA degradation. Thus, the apparent “modest” effect of TRIM5α on CA degradation compared with the “dramatic” effect of TRIM5α on HIV-1 infection can be explained by the selective degradation of the subset of CA delivered into the cytosol of restrictive cells that represents productively entered cores. The Mode of Viral Entry Does Not Influence Accelerated Cytosolic CA Degradation by TRIM5α—To date, we have exclusively used VSVG-pseudotyped viruses, and we asked whether the mode of entry influences the RhMTRIM5α-mediated CA degradation. We thus compared CA degradation in cells exposed to a virus that expresses VSVG or gp120. In the absence of envelope, no CA is detected in cytosolic extracts (Fig. 2b). Importantly, we observed a similar pattern of vesicular and cytosolic CA degradation in restrictive cells infected with gp120-pseudotyped (Fig. 2c) or VSVG-pseudotyped viruses (Fig. 2a). Thus, the mode of entry does not affect TRIM5α-mediated CA degradation. This is in accordance with the fact that RhMTRIM5α restricts VSVG-pseudotyped or gp120-pseudotyped HIV-1 equally well (Fig. 1A). TRIM5α-mediated Accelerated Degradation of Incoming HIV-1 CA Is Apparently Independent of the Proteasome—Because TRIM5α contains a ubiquitin ligase domain, it has been envisioned that TRIM5α interrupts HIV-1 infection by proteasome degradation of incoming viral proteins (32Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). However, inactivation of RhMTRIM5α ubiquitin ligase activity, either by RING domain removal or by RING cysteine mutations, only partially diminished its restriction activity (8Stremlau M. Owens C.M. Perron M.J. Kiessling M. Autissier P. Sodroski J. Nature. 2004; 427: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 33Javanbakht H. Diaz-Griffero F. Stremlau M. Si Z. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26933-26940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of the proteasome to the RhMTRIM5α-mediated CA degradation, we examined the fate of incoming CA in nonrestrictive and restrictive cells treated with or without proteasome inhibitors. We thus examined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on CA present in whole lysate as well as in cytosolic and vesicular extracts. Proteasome inhibitors enhanced the endurance of all incoming viral proteins, including MA and CA (Fig. 3A), reverse transcriptase and NC (data not shown) in whole lysates of both nonrestrictive and restrictive cells. Proteasome inhibitors enhance CA endurance in nonrestrictive and restrictive cells equally (Fig. 3B), and they significantly increase HIV-1 infection in nonrestrictive and restrictive cells equally (Fig. 3C). This is in accordance with previous studies that showed that proteasome inhibitors increase HIV-1 infection via unknown mechanisms (34Schwartz O. Marechal V. Friguet B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Heard J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3845-3850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Wei B.L. Denton P.W. O'Neill E. Luo T. Foster J.L. Garcia J.V. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5705-5712Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, CA degradation in whole lysates remains more severe in restrictive cells than in untreated nonrestrictive cells even in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 3, A and B). Specifically, by ELISA, 80% of incoming CA in whole lysates is degraded in restrictive cells 5 h post-infection, whereas only 40% of incoming CA is degraded in nonrestrictive cells (Fig. 3B). This suggests that incoming cores undergo an additional degradation that selectively targets CA in restrictive cells. After examining the effect of proteasome inhibitors on incoming CA in whole lysate, we examined their effect on CA populations delivered into the cytosolic (productive entry) or vesicular (abortive entry) compartments. Proteasome inhibitors enhance both cytosolic and vesicular CA endurance in nonrestrictive and restrictive cells equally (Fig. 3D). Although proteasome inhibitors significantly enhance the endurance of cytosolic CA, they do not fully preserve cytosolic CA integrity in restrictive cells as we observed in whole lysates (Fig. 3A). As above (Fig. 2), cytosolic CA remains perfectly intact over time (even 5 h post-infection) in nonrestrictive cells but undergoes significant degradation in restrictive cells (Fig. 3D). We frequently observed that cytosolic CA accumulation is maximal 2-3 h after cells, pre-exposed with HIV-1 for 1 h at 4°C, were placed at 37 °C for viral internalization (data not shown). Cytosolic MA does not undergo an accelerated degradation in restrictive cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting a selective TRIM5-mediated effect on CA. Both vesicular MA and CA undergo similar degradation in nonrestrictive and restrictive cells in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors weakly preserve the integrity of vesicular CA (in contrast to cytosolic CA) (Fig. 3D), suggesting that proteases other than proteasomal proteases, possibly lysosomal proteases, are responsible for CA degradation in the vesicular compartment. Proteasome inhibitors significantly enhance TRIM5α accumulation in the cytosolic compartment of both nonrestrictive and restrictive cells (Fig. 3D). Because TRIM5α is ubiquinylated, it is likely that proteasomes regulate its cell turnover. Interestingly, although TRIM5α is normally mainly cytosolic, proteasome inhibitors mediate accumulation of TRIM5α in the vesicular compartment. This may originate either from a relocation of a subset of TRIM5α proteins from the cytosolic compartment into the vesicular compartment or from protection against a proteosomal attack in the vesicular compartment. Because proteasome inhibitors do not fully preserve the integrity of cytosolic CA in restrictive cells, our data suggest that cytosolic CA is subjected to two proteolytic attacks, one that is proteasome-mediated and another that is RhMTRIM5α-mediated but apparently proteasome-independent. OMK TRIM5-CypA, Like RhMTRIM5α, Accelerates Degradation of Incoming HIV-1 CA—To determine whether the RhMTRIM5a-mediated accelerated CA degradation represents a common event in restrictive monkey cells, we asked whether another restriction factor, TRIM5-CypA (16Sayah D.M. Sokolskaja E. Berthoux L. Luban J. Nature. 2004; 430: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 17Nisole S. Lynch C. Stoye J.P. Yap M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13324-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), prevents HIV-1 infection of OMK cells by also targeting CA for degradation. To test this hypothesis, we sought conditions, which prevent CA recognition by TRIM5-CypA and that restore the capacity of HIV-1 to infect restrictive OMK cells. Mutating the CypA-binding region of CA (G89V substitution), adding a cyclosporin A analog (Debio-025) that binds to the CypA moiety of TRIM5-CypA (Fig. 4A), or saturating endogenous TRIM5-CypA by an excess of virus (Fig. 4B) all alleviate the restriction and restore the capacity of HIV-1 to infect OMK cells (16Sayah D.M. Sokolskaja E. Berthoux L. Luban J. Nature. 2004; 430: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 17Nisole S. Lynch C. Stoye J.P. Yap M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 2005; 79: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We then asked whether TRIM5-CypA accelerates CA degradation in whole lysates of restrictive OMK cells, whether this degradation is prevented by disrupting CA-TRIM5-CypA interactions, and whether saturating OMK cells at high multiplicity of infection preserves CA. We found that incoming CA is more rapidly degraded in whole lysates of OMK cells than equally abundant MA (Fig. 4C). This selective CA degradation in OMK cells is reminiscent of the accelerated CA degradation observed in HeLa-RhMTRIM5 cells (Fig. 1B). Together, our findings reveal a correlation between the presence of RhMTRIM5α and OMK TRIM5-CypA, a block in HIV-1 infectivity, and a selective accelerated degradation of incoming CA. Importantly, Debio-025 enhances the integrity of incoming CA in whole lysates (Fig. 4, C and D). Specifically, CA is only moderately degraded 4 h post-infection in Debio-025-treated cells, whereas it is significantly degraded in untreated cells (Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast to wild-type capsid, the G89V CA remains intact (Fig. 4, C and D). The endurance of G89V CA toward TRIM5-CypA-mediated degradation correlates with the capacity of G89V HIV-1 to infect OMK cells (Fig. 4A). Our findings that wild-type, but not G89V CA, undergoes more rapid degradation demonstrate the specificity of the TRIM5-CypA-mediated accelerated CA degradation. G89V CA remains intact even 4 h post-infection, whereas wild-type CA in the presence of Debio-025 starts to undergo degradation 4 h post-infection (Fig. 4, C and D). This correlates with our observation that Debio-025 partially restores HIV-1 infectivity in OMK cells (25%) compared with G89V HIV-1 infectivity (55%) (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, incoming CA is protected from degradation when OMK cells are infected with large amounts of virus (10 μg of p24) rather than physiological amounts of virus (10-100 ng of p24) (Fig. 4C). This is in accordance with our data above that show that pre-exposing OMK cells with high concentrations of virus restores the capacity of HIV-1 to infect OMK cells (Fig. 4B). Importantly, both pharmacological (Debio-025) and genetic (G89V mutation) interventions that prevent HIV-1 CA recognition by TRIM5-CypA protect CA from degradation and rescue HIV-1 infectivity in OMK cells. Thus, by using two distinct anti-HIV-1 restriction entities, RhMTRIM5α and OMK TRIM5-CypA, our data suggest that there is a relationship between TRIM5-mediated HIV-1 restriction and a selective accelerated degradation of incoming CA. Although it is well established that monkey TRIM5α and TRIM5-CypA proteins block HIV-1 infection, it is still obscure how they interrupt the virus pathway. Immediately after entry into restrictive cells, we found that incoming HIV-1 CA undergoes an accelerated degradation. The degradation is apparently specific because other equally abundant structural viral proteins, such as MA and NC as well as viral components that reside within the CA core (reverse transcriptase and viral RNA), do not undergo the TRIM5α-mediated accelerated degradation in restrictive cells. We found that all incoming viral proteins (CA, MA, NC, and reverse transcriptase) are equally susceptible to proteasome degradation and that proteasome inhibitors enhance HIV-1 infection in both nonrestrictive and restrictive cells. Thus, degradation of incoming viral proteins by the proteasome may represent an intracellular defense against HIV-1. Given that HIV-1 infects human cells efficiently, our data indicate that although the bulk of incoming cytosolic CA is degraded by the proteasome, a subset is diverted from this abortive degradation pathway into an infectious pathway. This is in accordance with our findings that the subset of incoming CA, which reached the cytosol of nonrestrictive cells (productively entered cores), remains intact even in the presence of “active” proteasomes. Because proteasome inhibitors do not fully protect cytosolic CA from degradation in restrictive cells, this may suggest that the TRIM5α-mediated degradation does not utilize the proteasome machinery to accelerate the degradation of cytosolic CA. Future studies should determine which cellular proteases are utilized by TRIM5α to accelerate cytosolic CA degradation. Although one cannot totally exclude the possibility that proteosome inhibitors disrupt the degradation of proteins by lysosomes and other endocytic pathways as recently reported (38Yu G.Y. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), our data suggest that incoming CA is subjected to two distinct degradations in restrictive cells, a proteasome- and a TRIM5α-mediated degradation that is apparently proteasome-independent. A central finding of the study is that in contrast to the proteasome-mediated proteolytic attack that degrades all incoming viral proteins (CA, MA, NC and reverse transcriptase), the TRIM5α-mediated degradation targets cytosolic (not vesicular) CA specifically (not G89V capsid) and apparently exclusively (not MA, NC, reverse transcriptase and viral RNA). The joint action of the “nonselective” degradation of all incoming viral proteins by the proteasome and the “selective” CA degradation by TRIM5α may contribute to an accelerated degradation of CA and therefore to the inability of HIV-1 to infect restrictive cells. Our data further suggest that the CA population that reaches the cytosolic compartment and that contains productively entered cores represents a point of vulnerability in the HIV-1 life cycle that could be exploited. During the course of this study, two independent groups reported findings, which shed light on the mechanisms of action of TRIM5α on HIV-1. In one study, Stremlau et al. (39Stremlau M. Perron M. Lee M. Li Y. Song B. Javanbakht H. DiazGriffero F. Anderson D.J. Sundquist W.I. Sodroski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5514-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) elegantly demonstrated that TRIM5α binding to CA (recombinant CA-NC proteins) represents a precondition for HIV-1 restriction. More importantly, they found that the presence of TRIM5α in target cells correlates with a decrease in the amount of particulate cytosolic HIV-1 as well as N-MLV CA. Interestingly, the loss of particulate N-MLV CA (but not of HIV-1 CA) was accompanied by an increase in soluble CA, presumably uncoated CA molecules (39Stremlau M. Perron M. Lee M. Li Y. Song B. Javanbakht H. DiazGriffero F. Anderson D.J. Sundquist W.I. Sodroski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5514-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Based on the interesting findings, the authors proposed that TRIM5α restricts retroviral infection by specifically recognizing CA cores and promoting their premature disassembly (39Stremlau M. Perron M. Lee M. Li Y. Song B. Javanbakht H. DiazGriffero F. Anderson D.J. Sundquist W.I. Sodroski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5514-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In another study, Wu et al. (40Wu X. Anderson J.L. Campbell E.M. Joseph A.M. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) showed that the reversible proteasome inhibitor MG132 enhances reverse transcription in both TRIM5α- nonrestrictive and TRIM5α+ restrictive cells. Although MG132 restores generation of HIV-1 late reverse transcription products in TRIM5α+ restrictive cells, HIV-1 infection and generation of 1- and 2-long terminal repeat circular reverse transcription products remain impaired (40Wu X. Anderson J.L. Campbell E.M. Joseph A.M. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This is in accordance with our observation (Fig. 3C) as well as by others (41Perez-Caballero D. Hatziioannou T. Zhang F. Cowan S. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15567-15572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 42Diaz-Griffero F. Li X. Javanbakht H. Song B. Welikala S. Stremlau M. Sodroski J. Virology. 2006; 349: 300-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) that proteasome inhibitors do not rescue HIV-1 infectivity in restrictive cells. The authors proposed that TRIM5α restricts HIV-1 in two distinct phases, altering the normal transport of the RTC to the nucleus and targeting the RTC to be degraded by the proteasome (40Wu X. Anderson J.L. Campbell E.M. Joseph A.M. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Based on this model, the authors speculated that MG132, by blocking the second restriction phase, allows accumulation of nonfunctional full-length reverse transcription products (40Wu X. Anderson J.L. Campbell E.M. Joseph A.M. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). How could we reconcile these data with our present data, which show a correlation between TRIM5α-mediated restriction and selective degradation of cytosolic HIV-1 CA? Stremlau et al. (39Stremlau M. Perron M. Lee M. Li Y. Song B. Javanbakht H. DiazGriffero F. Anderson D.J. Sundquist W.I. Sodroski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5514-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) were unable to show that the loss of HIV-1 CA particulates was accompanied by an increase of free CA. This may suggest that either uncoated HIV-1 CA molecules are too rapidly degraded to be detected as free CA molecules, that HIV-1 CA cores are degraded without uncoating, or that HIV-1 CA cores are directed into compartments distinct from the cytosolic compartment such as the vesicular compartment, where they eventually are uncoated and/or degraded. Thus, the loss of HIV-1 CA particulates in restrictive cells observed by Stremlau et al. (39Stremlau M. Perron M. Lee M. Li Y. Song B. Javanbakht H. DiazGriffero F. Anderson D.J. Sundquist W.I. Sodroski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5514-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) does not conflict with our results that showed that the presence of RhMTRIM5α correlates with a significant loss of cytosolic CA. Several scenarios may explain how TRIM5α mediates both CA core uncoating and degradation. In one scenario, TRIM5α binds cores and directs them to compartments where they are uncoated and/or degraded (i.e. lysosomes). In another, TRIM5α permits the docking onto the core of proteases, which take the CA shell apart such that the inner RTC is no longer functional. In another, TRIM5α provokes core uncoating, and uncoated CA molecules are more susceptible to degradation than core-associated CA molecules. It is important to note that in contrast to our study, Stremlau et al. (39Stremlau M. Perron M. Lee M. Li Y. Song B. Javanbakht H. DiazGriffero F. Anderson D.J. Sundquist W.I. Sodroski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5514-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) did not use a synchronized system for virus entry. The absolute rates of core uncoating or CA degradation were thus not examined. This may also explain why surprisingly no CA core uncoating was observed in nonrestrictive cells, even 16 h post-infection (39Stremlau M. Perron M. Lee M. Li Y. Song B. Javanbakht H. DiazGriffero F. Anderson D.J. Sundquist W.I. Sodroski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5514-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize that an accelerated CA degradation in restrictive cells can be detected only when the restriction is maximal (i.e. in HeLa-RhMTRIM5 or OMK cells, see Figs. 1A and 4). If target cells restrict HIV-1 only partially (i.e. 50% inhibition of infectivity), we were unable to observe a significant and reproducible difference in CA degradation between nonrestrictive and restrictive cells (data not shown). This suggests that either TRIM5-mediated CA degradation can only be experimentally observed when the restriction is maximal or that TRIM5α blocks HIV-1 infection by interfering with more than one step in the retrovirus life cycle as recently suggested by Yap et al. (43Yap M.W. Mark P.D. Stoye P.S. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 4061-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is also important to note that the same highly restrictive HeLa-RhMTRIM5 cells were used to demonstrate CA core uncoating (39Stremlau M. Perron M. Lee M. Li Y. Song B. Javanbakht H. DiazGriffero F. Anderson D.J. Sundquist W.I. Sodroski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5514-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) and CA degradation (in this study). Wu et al. (40Wu X. Anderson J.L. Campbell E.M. Joseph A.M. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) showed that proteasome inhibitors allow accumulation of nonfunctional full-length reverse transcription products in restrictive cells, whereas we showed that proteasome inhibitors do not fully preserve the integrity of incoming CA in restrictive cells. Several scenarios may explain how proteasome inhibitors restore reverse transcription in restrictive cells but fail to preserve full CA integrity and to restore infectivity. In one scenario, proteasome inhibitors, by blocking the second TRIM5-mediated restriction phase, allow accumulation of integration-competent but nonfunctional reverse transcription complexes as suggested by Wu et al. (40Wu X. Anderson J.L. Campbell E.M. Joseph A.M. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In another scenario, proteasome inhibitors, by preserving the integrity of reverse transcriptase, enhance the generation of full-length reverse transcription products in abortive compartments. We showed that proteasome inhibitors enhance the endurance of all incoming viral proteins, including CA, MA, NC, and reverse transcriptase. Thus, one can envision that proteasome inhibitors, by preserving the integrity of reverse transcriptase of cores trapped into an abortive compartment, allow accumulation of nonfunctional, full-length reverse transcription products (40Wu X. Anderson J.L. Campbell E.M. Joseph A.M. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Given that complete reverse transcription occurs normally in nonrestrictive cells, this certainly explains the small but significant enhancement of accumulation of full-length reverse transcription products observed in nonrestrictive cells compared with the more profound enhancement observed in restrictive cells (40Wu X. Anderson J.L. Campbell E.M. Joseph A.M. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In another scenario, proteasome inhibitors, by influencing the trafficking and/or turnover of TRIM5α, divert the productively entered cores from the infectious pathway into an abortive pathway. Proteasome inhibitors alter both self-ubiquitination and subcellular localization of TRIM5α (40Wu X. Anderson J.L. Campbell E.M. Joseph A.M. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 42Diaz-Griffero F. Li X. Javanbakht H. Song B. Welikala S. Stremlau M. Sodroski J. Virology. 2006; 349: 300-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). One can thus envision that altering physiological ubiquitination and/or localization of TRIM5α would allow the trapping of core-TRIM5α complexes into abortive compartments. Supporting this hypothesis, we showed that proteasome inhibitors significantly protect TRIM5α from degradation in infected cells and that they redirect a subset of TRIM5α proteins into the vesicular compartment (Fig. 3D). Thus, further work is required to determine the contribution of the proteasome in the TRIM5-mediated restriction. Future studies are necessary to determine whether TRIM5α-mediated CA degradation is truly the cause or simply the result of the TRIM5α-mediated restriction. Moreover, further work is necessary to determine whether CA degradation and CA core uncoating are distinct or linked events, and if they are linked, which one is the consequence of the other, and most importantly, whether the two events are required to interrupt the infectious pathway of HIV-1.

Type II diabetes, also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is characterized by a deficiency in insulin signaling despite normal or greatly elevated levels of insulin. Although the cause of insulin resistance is unknown, inhibiting enzymes that negatively regulate the signaling pathway may restore insulin responsiveness.

A number of PTP1B inhibitors containing highly charged non-hydrolyzable phosphonate mimetics have been reported (7Johnson T.O. Ermolieff J. Jirousek M.R. Nat. Rev.

Poor membrane permeability, however, has limited their development as drug candidates. The lack of inhibitors with suitable physicochemical properties can be attributed to the need to interact with the highly positively charged primary phosphate binding pocket and the surrounding flat, solventexposed region. We have recently reported the structure-based design of a novel isothiazolidinone (IZD) heterocyclic phosphonate mimetic and its potential use as an inhibitor of PTP1B when incorporated into a peptide (14Combs A.P.

Our lead compound 6 has an IC50 value of 190 nm, it is selective against SHP 1 and 2 (IC50 > 100 μm), and it is nine times more potent than the equivalent difluoromethylphosphonic acid (DFMP) derivative 11 (Table 2). The IZD heterocycle is a unique phosphonate mimetic because it interacts extensively with the phosphate binding loop, but only possesses a single delocalized negative charge (15Ala, P. J., Gonneville, L., Hillman, M. C., Becker-Pasha, M., Wei, M., Reid, B. G., Klabe, R., Yue, E. W., Wayland, B., Douty, B., Combs, A. P., Polam, P., Wasserman, Z., Bower, M., Burn, T. C., Hollis, G.

We had hoped that the latter feature would confer improved membrane permeability compared with the highly charged phosphonate and carboxylate moieties found in most inhibitors. Unfortunately, IZD peptide 6 is not cell permeable. We rationalized that the lack of permeability may be due in part to the polar character of the peptidic scaffold and not solely the IZD heterocycle and that replacing it with less polar moieties might improve permeability. The discovery of nonpeptidic IZD-containing inhibitors with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range and cellular activity in an IR phosphorylation assay has recently been described (16Combs A.P.

We now report the structural insights that have led to the design of these inhibitors.TABLE 2SAR of A and C site substituents Protein Expression, Purification, and Biochemical Assay—The protein was expressed and purified as reported previously (15Ala, P. J., Gonneville, L., Hillman, M. C., Becker-Pasha, M., Wei, M., Reid, B. G., Klabe, R., Yue, E. W., Wayland, B., Douty, B., Combs, A. P., Polam, P., Wasserman, Z., Bower, M., Burn, T. C., Hollis, G. F., and Wynn, R. (August 17, 2006) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M606873200Google Scholar). Briefly, two constructs of the catalytic domain of human PTP1B (435 amino acids) were expressed in Escherichia coli: 1-321 and 1-(His6)-298. PTP1B-(1-321) was initially purified in two steps using Q-Sepharose and Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow resins (GE Healthcare), and PTP1B 1-(His6)-298 was initially purified using Talon metal affinity resin (BD Bioscience). Column fractions containing PTP1B were then injected onto a HiLoad Superdex 75 26/60 Prep Grade column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing the pure protein were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored at -20 °C. Enzymatic assays were performed as described in the literature (15Ala, P. J., Gonneville, L., Hillman, M. C., Becker-Pasha, M., Wei, M., Reid, B. G., Klabe, R., Yue, E. W., Wayland, B., Douty, B., Combs, A. P., Polam, P., Wasserman, Z., Bower, M., Burn, T. C., Hollis, G. F., and Wynn, R.

Crystallization and Data Collection—All crystals were grown using the vapor diffusion method with or without microseeding in 24-well plates in which the protein drops were equilibrated against 1 ml of well solution at 4 °C. Rod-shaped crystals of PTP1B 1-(His6)-298 in complex with 1 (0.05 × 0.05 × 0.3 mm) appeared 10 days after mixing 2 μl of protein/inhibitor solution (10 mg/ml protein, 0.025% β-octylglucoside, 2mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, and 2.4 mm inhibitor) with 2 μl of well solution (100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 1.4-1.8 m ammonium sulfate). Rod-shaped crystals of PTP1B-(1-321) in complex with 2, 3, and 5 (0.04-0.06 × 0.04-0.06 × 0.2-0.3 mm) appeared 5 days after mixing 2 μl of protein/inhibitor solution (10 mg/ml protein and 5, 1.6, and 3 mm inhibitor, respectively) with 2 μl of well solution (100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 17% polyethylene glycol 20,000, and 100 mm magnesium chloride). Rod-shaped crystals of PTP1B-(1-321)/4 (0.08 × 0.08 × 0.4 mm) appeared 5 days after mixing 2 μl of protein/inhibitor solution (10 mg/ml protein and 1.5 mm inhibitor) with 2 μl of well solution (160 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.3, and 16% polyethylene glycol 3350) and macroseeding. Cryodata collections were performed by transferring crystals stepwise at 2-min intervals into cryoprotectant solutions of mother liquor containing 10 and 20% glycerol and then flash cooling them in a nitrogen stream at -180 °C. Diffraction data were collected with one crystal per dataset on a Rigaku/MSC RAXIS IV++ imaging system mounted on a Rigaku/MSC MicroMax™-007 rotating anode microfocus generator (CuKα) operating at 40 kV and 20 mA and equipped with a 0.3-mm cathode, 0.5- and 0.03-mm double collimator, and a Blue Confocal Max-Flux® optical system. Diffraction intensities were integrated and scaled using CrystalClear (Rigaku/MSC). Structure Determination and Refinement—The structures of PTP1B 1-(His6)-298/1 and PTP1B-(1-321) in complex with 3 and 4 were solved by molecular replacement using the protein coordinates from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18) entry code 1EEO as the search model and the program CNX (Accelrys). All rotation and translation searches yielded single consistent solutions for data between 15 and 4 Å. The resulting models were subjected to rigid body refinement followed by simulated annealing (using torsion angle dynamics), positional, and temperature factor refinements using CNX. The structures of PTP1B-(1-321) in complex with 2 and 5 were solved by difference Fourier methods using the relevant starting model. The conformations of the bound inhibitors were unambiguously determined after one or two cycles of refinement. The final models were generated after several cycles of model building and refinement using QUANTA (Accelrys) and CNX, respectively. Only the (S)-IZD stereoisomers of 3, 4, and 5 were observed in the crystal structures even though diastereoisomeric mixtures were used in the crystallization experiments. Solvent molecules were added by visual inspection of electron density maps using X-SOLVATE (Accelrys). Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for PTP1B in complex with various inhibitors Survey of the PTP1B Active Site—A wealth of structural data has been reported ever since the crystal structure of PTP1B was first determined in 1994 (19Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). One of the most interesting structures is PTP1B in complex with the IR kinase activation segment (20Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), which revealed that the large, negatively charged substrate interacts with multiple positively charged sites in the protein (A, B, C, and E) (Fig. 1). To help us rank the sites in terms of suitability for drug design, we compared their structural characteristics, biological relevance, and impact on ligand binding affinity. Structural Characteristics and Biological Relevance of Ligand Binding Sites—The A site is the catalytic pocket of the enzyme where phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) residues of the IR kinase activation peptide are dephosphorylated. The importance of interacting with this site is also highlighted by the fact that Tyr(P) accounts for about 53% of the buried surface area of an epidermal growth factor receptor hexapeptide (21Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The pocket is ∼9 Å deep and 10 Å wide and can be divided into two regions (Fig. 2). The upper half of the pocket is located near the surface of the protein and contains hydrophobic residues that interact with the aryl ring of Tyr(P). The lower half is located near the positive end of the helix dipole of α4 and contains the signature motif common to all members of the PTP family (22Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Møller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). This unique motif is a well defined loop with all of its backbone nitrogens pointing toward the center. This arrangement creates a polar surface complementary to the phosphate anion of Tyr(P) just above the catalytic thiolate of Cys215, where phosphonate oxygens hydrogen bond to the backbone nitrogens. The three-dimensional shape and partially solvent-shielded nature of the A site provide the possibility of forming extensive interactions with a small molecule, and interacting with Asp48 on the outer edge of the pocket has been shown to increase selectivity (23Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. Branner S. Mortensen S.B. Peters G.H. Norris K. Olsen O.H. Jeppesen C.B. Lundt B.F. Ripka W. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10300-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ligand binding can displace several tightly bound waters that interact with the phosphate binding loop (15Ala, P. J., Gonneville, L., Hillman, M. C., Becker-Pasha, M., Wei, M., Reid, B. G., Klabe, R., Yue, E. W., Wayland, B., Douty, B., Combs, A. P., Polam, P., Wasserman, Z., Bower, M., Burn, T. C., Hollis, G. F., and Wynn, R. (August 17, 2006) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M606873200Google Scholar). The only disadvantage of building into the A site is the need for inhibitors to possess a highly complimentary polar surface to avoid burying unsolvated polar residues. The B site, a noncatalytic secondary phosphate binding pocket, is larger (13 × 20 Å), shallower (<4 Å), and more solvent exposed than the A site (Fig. 2). Although these characteristics are not conducive to binding small nonpolar ligands, the advantage of interacting with this site is the possibility of simultaneously increasing affinity and specificity. For example, phosphorylating Tyr1163 of the monophosphorylated (Tyr(P)1162) IR kinase activation segment increases binding affinity by 70-fold (20Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The lack of a side chain at Gly259, located at the center of the pocket, is thought to be the reason why the site can accommodate the bulky phosphate group of Tyr(P)1163. Any other residue at this location would sterically hinder phosphate binding. Other desirable design features are its close proximity to the A site, the possibility of displacing tightly bound waters (15Ala, P. J., Gonneville, L., Hillman, M. C., Becker-Pasha, M., Wei, M., Reid, B. G., Klabe, R., Yue, E. W., Wayland, B., Douty, B., Combs, A. P., Polam, P., Wasserman, Z., Bower, M., Burn, T. C., Hollis, G. F., and Wynn, R. (August 17, 2006) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M606873200Google Scholar), and the opportunity to interact with hydrophobic residues (Val49, Phe52, Ile219, and Met258). The C site does not appear to have any biological relevance other than binding Thr1160 and Glu1159 of the IR kinase activation peptide. The pocket, which shares Tyr46 and Asp48 with the A site, is large, completely solvent exposed, and extremely flat except for Arg47 and Lys41 (Fig. 2). The lack of binding determinants is consistent with the fact that C site substituents are often disordered. Determining the bound conformations of these substituents is also complicated by the fact that they often participate in crystal packing interactions. For example, the benzyl substituent of compound 1 (Table 1) stacks with the side chain of Glu167 from a symmetry related molecule. We therefore consider the C site to be less suitable than the A and B sites for structure-based design techniques, which often require accurate predictions of bound conformations of substituents. The D site does not appear to have a biological function and it is the only site that does not interact with the IR kinase activation peptide. It is a small narrow pocket, partially shielded from solvent, and lined with polar and charged residues: Tyr46, Glu115, Lys120, Asp181, and Ser216 (Fig. 2). The most desirable aspect of building into this site is the possibility of increasing potency with only a small increase in molecular weight. Small substituents (one or two atoms) attached ortho to the phosphonate on the aryl ring of Tyr(P) can interact extensively with D site residues. Finally, the E site is a flat solvent-exposed region located over the flap and adjacent to the B site. It has no known biological function except for binding Arg1164 of the IR kinase activation peptide, which appears to stabilize the closed conformation of the flap through π-stacking interactions with Phe182. Inhibitors that mimic these interactions may benefit from a slow off-rate. Extending beyond the flap, further into the E site, is probably not a good idea because this region, like the C site, contains very few binding determinants. Preliminary SAR—The Ki value for the minimal unit of p-difluorophosphonomethyl phenylalanine (pF2PMP), which binds in the A site, is only 2.5 mm compared with 180 nm when it is integrated into the epidermal growth factor receptor peptide (residues 1012-1017) (24Yao Z.J. Ye B. Wu X.W. Wang S. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. Burke Jr., T.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 1799-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Chen L. Wu L. Otaka A. Smyth M.S. Roller P.P. Burke Jr., T.R. Hertog J.D. Zhang Z.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This observation highlights the importance of interacting with sites other than the primary phosphate binding pocket. To obtain an initial estimate of the importance of binding to the A and C sites, we solved the crystal structure of PTP1B/1 and measured the IC50 values for various DFMP derivatives (Table 2). The bound conformation of 1 is very similar to that of other reported DFMP structures (Fig. 3). The DFMP moiety adjacent to the C-terminal primary amide anchors the inhibitor in the A site by hydrogen bonding to the phosphate binding loop and side chain of Arg221. Based on the IC50 values of 7 and 8, this proximal DFMP increases potency by 82,000-fold. The C-terminal amide (R2 substituent), which hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate of Asp48, increases potency by 27-fold based on a comparison of the IC50 values of 1 and 9. The rest of the inhibitor extends into the C site where the benzyl at position R3 binds over the C-terminal amide and the distal pF2PMP binds between the side chains of Lys41 and Arg47.A comparison of the IC50 values of 1, 10, and 11 indicates that the C site substituents pF2PMP and R3-benzyl increase potency by 1000- and 25-fold, respectively. The importance of the distal pF2PMP is surprising given the fact that it is fairly disordered (average temperature factor is 40 Å2) and it only interacts with Lys41 and Arg47, which are also disordered and solvent exposed. Based on this preliminary SAR, the A site DFMP is clearly the most important substituent followed by the C site pF2PMP, R2-amide, and R3-benzyl. Substituents that bind in the B site can also significantly increase potency. As mentioned above, phosphorylating Tyr1163 increases the binding affinity of the monophosphorylated IR kinase peptide by 70-fold; and the hydroxyl group of salicylate, which hydrogen bonds to Arg24 and Arg254, increases the potency of an oxalylaminobenzoic acid derivative by 90-fold (26Liu G. Xin Z. Liang H. Abad-Zapatero C. Hajduk P.J. Janowick D.A. Szczepankiewicz B.G. Pei Z. Hutchins C.W. Ballaron S.J. Stashko M.A. Lubben T.H. Berg C.E. Rondinone C.M. Trevillyan J.M. Jirousek M.R. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3437-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ligands that bind to the D site are also responsible for a wide range of increases in potency. For example, bromine and chlorine attached ortho to the phosphonate on the aryl ring of pF2PMP increase potency by about 5- and 16-fold, respectively (27Dufresne C. Roy P. Wang Z. Asante-Appiah E. Cromlish W. Boie Y. Forghani F. Desmarais S. Wang Q. Skorey K. Waddleton D. Ramachandran C. Kennedy B.P. Xu L. Gordon R. Chan C.C. Leblanc Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and o-carboxyl attached to a 2-carboxymethoxybenzoic acid derivative increases potency by 130-fold (28Burke Jr., T.R. Yao Z.J. Zhao H. Milne G.W.A. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. Voigt J.H. Tetrahedron. 1998; 54: 9981-9994Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, two ligands that bind at the A-E border, the side chain of Arg1164 of the IR kinase activation peptide (20Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and the indole ring of a 2-(oxalyl-amino)-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid derivative (29Hansen, T. K., Iversen, L. F., Lau, J., Petersen, A. K., Olsen, O. H., Moller, K. B., Mortensen, S. B., Billestrup, N., Ge, Y., Newman, M., Holsworth, D., Lund, I. K., Andersen, B., Peters, G., Andersen, H. S., and Moller, N. P. (2002) in Potent Nonpeptide Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Inhibitors, 223rd ACS National Meeting, Orlando, FL, April 7-11, 2002, ACS Publications, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar), interact with Phe182 of the flap through π-stacking interactions; their contributions to binding, however, have not been reported. Based on the structural analysis and preliminary SAR described above, the A site is clearly the most promising drug binding site, despite its highly polar character, followed by the D, B, C, and E sites. Although interacting with the C site can significantly increase potency, we downgraded its importance due to the lack of binding determinants. Our attempts to improve the cell permeability of our lead IZD-peptide 6 (Table 2) therefore consisted of eliminating its peptidic nature by replacing the C-terminal amide with a less polar substituent, replacing the N terminus with a small nonpeptidic C site substituent, and building into the D site. Designing Nonpeptidic IZD-based Inhibitors—Compound 6 was first modified by replacing the C-terminal primary amide with a benzimidazole ring in an attempt to hydrogen bond to the carboxylate of Asp48, an important interaction based on our preliminary SAR (Fig. 3). The resulting inhibitor was ∼10-fold more potent than the primary amide (16Combs A.P. Zhu W. Crawley M.L. Glass B. Polam P. Sparks R.B. Modi D. Takvorian A. McLaughlin E. Yue E.W. Wasserman Z. Bower M. Wei M. Rupar M. Ala P.J. Reid B.M. Ellis D. Gonneville L. Emm T. Taylor N. Yeleswaram S. Li Y. Wynn R. Burn T.C. Hollis G. Liu P.C. Metcalf B. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 3774-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PTP1B/2 confirms that the benzimidazole ring hydrogen bonds to Asp48 and participates in van der Waals (VDW) interactions with Phe182, at the A-E border (Fig. 4a). The increase in potency is therefore due to favorable VDW interactions as well as an increase in conformational entropy, because the benzimidazole ring can hydrogen bond equally well to Asp48 in two orientations related by 180°. The structure also explains the lack of SAR in the 5-position and the loss of activity in the 4-position, because 5-substituents simply project into solvent and 4-substituents probably clash with Phe182 or Asp48 depending on the orientation of the ring. Unsubstituted or 5-substituted benzimidazoles were therefore subsequently used to identify suitable replacements for the remainder of the peptide scaffold. Design and SAR of C Site Substituents—Nonpeptidic substituents were designed to replace the entire C site substituent up to the amide NH adjacent to the benzimidazole ring. Retaining the NH group would preserve the second hydrogen bond previously observed between the peptide scaffold and the carboxylate of Asp48 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, new substituents would project just beyond the A-C border and interact with nonpolar regions of Tyr46 and Arg47. Three nonpeptidic substituents were rapidly discovered: benzothiazoleamine, trifluoroacylamide, and aryl sulfonamide (16Combs A.P. Zhu W. Crawley M.L. Glass B. Polam P. Sparks R.B. Modi D. Takvorian A. McLaughlin E. Yue E.W. Wasserman Z. Bower M. Wei M. Rupar M. Ala P.J. Reid B.M. Ellis D. Gonneville L. Emm T. Taylor N. Yeleswaram S. Li Y. Wynn R. Burn T.C. Hollis G. Liu P.C. Metcalf B. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 3774-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Encouragingly, the derivatives have similar or smaller molecular weights and are nearly equipotent to 6. Optimizing the derivatives for potency, however, proved to be very difficult. The benzothiazoleamine 2 appeared to be a promising lead with an IC50 value of 240 nm; however, substitutions to the aryl ring of benzothiazole reduced potencies by 1-5-fold (Table 3). The crystal structure of PTP1B/2 reveals that the amine NH hydrogen bonds to Asp48 and the benzothiazole ring binds between the side chains of Tyr46 and Arg47 (Fig. 4a). Although electron density for the planar benzothiazole ring is fairly symmetric, we believe the sulfur atom faces the protein because of potential VDW interactions with Tyr46, Arg47, and Asp48 and because the nitrogen, on the opposite side of the ring, is solvent exposed and hydrogen bonds to water. Interestingly, a two-water bridge connects the benzothiazole and benzimidazole rings, perhaps stabilizing the bound conformation of the inhibitor. The most important observation with regards to the drug design process, however, is that the aryl ring of benzothiazole is almost completely solvent exposed. This observation explains why our attempts to improve potency by substituting positions 4, 5, and 6 were unsuccessful.TABLE 3SAR of C site benzothiazoleamine substituents The trifluoroacylamide 3 is one of our most potent (IC50 = 110 nm) C site amide derivatives. This was an unexpected result because the IC50 value of the methyl derivative 24 was ∼24-fold less active (Table 4). The structure of PTP1B/3 reveals that the trifluoroacylamide moiety binds just over the A-C border where the trifluoro group is in VDW contact with Tyr46, Arg47, and Asp48 (Fig. 4b). One of the fluorines also hydrogen bonds directly to the guanidinium group of Arg47 and another to the backbone NH of Arg47 via a water molecule. These interactions not only explain the high potency of the trifluoro derivative but also the loss of activity when fluorines are replaced with nonpolar substituents. Apart from the obvious loss of electrostatic interactions, replacing a single fluorine with methyl (25) or phenyl (26) or replacing the entire trifluoro group with an isopropyl (27) probably causes varying degrees of steric clash with Arg47. In the latter case, potency can be partially recovered but only after significantly increasing molecular weight by replacing the isopropyl with phenethyl (28), which probably interacts with the hydrophobic region of Arg47.TABLE 4SAR of C site trifluoroacylamide substituents Aryl sulfonamides are our most potent C site substituents (Table 5). The initial result that the unsubstituted aryl sulfonamide 36 was 5-fold more potent than the methylsulfonamide derivative (IC50 = 590 nm) was very encouraging; however, no obvious SAR trends were observed for a variety of substitutions to the aryl ring. Compound potencies were evenly distributed around the IC50 value of compound 36, with a maximum variation of only 3-fold in each direction. The most potent inhibitor 29 is substituted with 3-trifluoromethyl and 4-bromo and has an IC50 value of 40 nm, whereas the least potent 42 is substituted with 2-methyl and has an IC50 of 300 nm. The crystal structure of PTP1B/4 reveals that the aryl ring of aryl sulfonamide does not interact significantly with the protein but instead stacks over the benzimidazole ring (Fig. 4c). This unusual conformation appears to be stabilized by a two-water bridge that links the sulfone to the benzimidazole ring; a similar interaction is also present in the benzothiazoleamine 2 crystal structure (described above; Fig. 4a). The most important inhibitor-protein interactions are two hydrogen bonds from the sulfonamide and benzimidazole NHs to the carboxylate of Asp48 and a third between a sulfonamide oxygen and the backbone NH of Arg47 (via a water molecule). Because these hydrogen bonds are also likely present in the PTP1B/methylsulfonamide derivative complex, we believe the 5-fold increase in potency for the unsubstituted aryl sulfonamide 36 is due primarily to intramolecular π-stacking interaction of its aryl ring with the benzimidazole ring. Furthermore, the ±3-fold variation in IC50 values observed for various substituted aryl sulfonamides is probably a result of the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of the substituents on π-stacking interactions. The unexpected conformation of the aryl sulfonamide ring therefore not only explains the increased potency of the series but also the lack of useful SAR because substituents on the aryl ring project into solvent.TABLE 5SAR of C site aryl sulfonamide and D site ortho substituents As expected, optimizing nonpeptidic C site substituents is not trivial even when the crystal structures of lead compounds are available. Structural data clearly indicates that the benzothiazoleamine, trifluoroacylamide, and aryl sulfonamide substituents are not suitable candidates for optimization, as they are highly solvent exposed. Furthermore, the lack of binding determinants in the C site makes it even more difficult to optimize the substituents because their bound conformations are not easily predicted. The unexpected conformation of the aryl sulfonamide ring is a good example of what can happen when building into the flat, shallow C site, the aryl ring stacks on top of the benzimidazole ring instead of interacting with the protein. Fortunately, the original hits represent a significant reduction in peptidic character and retain key binding interactions. Aryl sulfonamides were selected as the preferred C site substituents because they are the most potent derivatives: the IC50 values for 2 (benzothiazoleamine), 3 (trifluoroacylamide), and 4 (aryl sulfonamide) are 240, 110, and 59 nm, compared with 190 nm for peptide 6. Design and SAR of D Site Substituents—Halides and small linear substituents attached ortho to the IZD heterocycle on the aryl ring of the IZD-phenyl template were synthesized first because o-Br had been reported to increase the activity of DFMP derivatives by 5-16-fold (27Dufresne C. Roy P. Wang Z. Asante-Appiah E. Cromlish W. Boie Y. Forghani F. Desmarais S. Wang Q. Skorey K. Waddleton D. Ramachandran C. Kennedy B.P. Xu L. Gordon R. Chan C.C. Leblanc Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The IC50 value for the unsubstituted IZD benzimidazole aryl sulfonamide 36 is 120 nm; o-CN, -F, -CH3, -Cl, -acetylene, and -Br substituents increase potency by 3.9-, 3.5-, 2-, 1.6-, 1-, and 0.7-fold, respectively (Table 5). The crystal structure of PTP1B in complex with the o-Cl derivative 5 confirms that the chlorine atom binds in the D site, less then 4 Å from Tyr46 and Ser216 and just over 4 Å from the side chain of Phe182 (Fig. 5). Its close proximity to residues in the narrow D site may explain why halides and linear substituents interact more favorably than branched substituents. The structure also reveals that o-Cl is only 3.5 and 3.1 Å from the CH and one of the sulfone oxygens of the heterocycle, respectively. This suggests that ortho halides may have differing effects on the conformational energy of the bound IZD-phenyl template depending on their VDW radii. Small halides would stabilize the observed low energy orthogonal orientation of the template, whereas large halides would clash with the heterocycle and increase the conformational energy of the bound template. The latter may explain why o-F and -CN derivatives are the most potent with IC50 values of about 30 nm, whereas o-Br is the least active with an IC50 of 170 nm. Note, however, that the requirement for small unbranched D site substituents is not a general observation for all Tyr(P) mimetics because o-Br and o-carboxylic acid substituents increase the potency of DFMP (27Dufresne C. Roy P. Wang Z. Asante-Appiah E. Cromlish W. Boie Y. Forghani F. Desmarais S. Wang Q. Skorey K. Waddleton D. Ramachandran C. Kennedy B.P. Xu L. Gordon R. Chan C.C. Leblanc Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Tetrahedron. 1998; 54: 9981-9994Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) derivatives by 5-16- and 130-fold, respectively. Extending IZD-based Inhibitors into the B Site—The crystal structure of PTP1B in complex with the potent (IC50 = 21 nm) tool compound 5 (Table 1) confirms that the IZD-phenyl template can project substituents into the B site (Fig. 5). The salicylate moiety hydrogen bonds to Arg24 and Arg254 and participates in VDW interactions with Met258. A future strategy for optimizing potency and reducing the polar surface area of the inhibitor might include rigidifying the linker, increasing interactions with the aryl ring of aryl sulfonamide, and replacing the salicylate with a less polar substituent. Conclusion—Structural analysis of the PTP1B active site and preliminary SAR have led us to conclude that the most important ligand binding site for drug design is the primary phosphate binding pocket, despite its highly polar character, followed by the D, B, C, and E sites. Based on this information, our design strategy for improving cell permeability of our lead IZD-peptide 6 consisted of eliminating the peptide scaffold in three major steps. First, the C-terminal primary amide was replaced with a benzimidazole ring, which hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate of Asp48 and participates in VDW interactions with the side chain of Phe182. Second, the entire peptidic C site substituent was replaced with three shorter nonpeptidic moieties: benzothiazoleamine, trifluoroacylamide, and aryl sulfonamide. Although the three substituents appeared to be promising leads, optimizing for potency proved to be very difficult due to a lack of useful SAR. Crystal structures of PTP1B in complex with the derivatives reveal that the substituents are not suitable candidates for further optimization. The aryl rings of benzothiazoleamine and aryl sulfonamide are highly solvent exposed, and the three fluorine atoms of trifluoroacylamide interact extensively with the protein and thus replacing one of them with a larger moiety probably causes a steric clash that disrupts interactions involving the other two. Fortunately, the nonpeptidic leads are more potent than 6 (except for the benzothiazoleamine derivative) and represent a significant reduction in peptidic character. Aryl sulfonamide derivatives were selected, without further modification, as the preferred C site series simply because they are the most potent compounds. Third, halides and small linear substituents were attached ortho to the IZD heterocycle on the aryl ring of the IZD-phenyl template. Based on the crystal structure of an o-Cl derivative, it appears that o-fluoro and o-cyano are the most potent substituents because they compliment the small, narrow D site and preorganize the IZD-phenyl template for binding. Combining the best substituents from each design step has produced one of our most potent inhibitors (IC50 = 10 nm): (S)-IZD-phenyl 5-Cl-benzimidazole substituted with a C site m-(CF3)-aryl sulfonamide and a D site o-fluoro. But more importantly, the D site o-CH3 derivative 45 (Table 5) has recently been reported to have cellular activity in an IR phosphorylation assay (16Combs A.P. Zhu W. Crawley M.L. Glass B. Polam P.

This result provides further evidence that IZD-containing compounds are a promising new class of PTP1B inhibitors."

We investigated type II MHC gene regulation in slow-type muscle fibers undergoing a slow to fast MHC transformation in response to inactivity, 7 days after spinal cord isolation (SI) in rats. We examined the transcriptional products of both the sense and antisense strands across the IIa-IIx-IIb MHC gene locus. A strand-specific reverse transcription (RT)-PCR approach was utilized to study the expression of the mRNA, the primary transcript (pre-mRNA), the antisense RNA overlapping the MHC genes, and both the intergenic sense and antisense RNAs. Results showed that the mRNA and pre-mRNA of each MHC had a similar response to SI, suggesting regulation of these genes at the transcriptional level. In addition, we detected previously unknown antisense strand transcription that produced natural antisense transcripts (NATs). RT-PCR mapping of the RNA products revealed that the antisense activity resulted in the formation of three major products: aII, xII, and bII NATs (antisense products of the IIa, IIx, and IIb genes, respectively). The aII NAT begins in the IIa-IIx intergenic region in close proximity to the IIx promoter, extends across the 27-kb IIa MHC gene, and continues to the IIa MHC gene promoter. The expression of the aII NAT was significantly up-regulated in muscles after SI, was negatively correlated with IIa MHC gene expression, and was positively correlated with IIx MHC gene expression. The exact role of the aII NAT is not clear; however, it is consistent with the inhibition of IIa MHC gene transcription. In conclusion, NATs may mediate cross-talk between adjacent genes, which may be essential to the coordinated regulation of the skeletal muscle MHC genes during dynamic phenotype shifts.

Skeletal muscle is highly adaptable when subjected to altered loading and hormone states. Its size, metabolic makeup, and contractile properties can all be altered to optimize function (1Baldwin K.M. Haddad F. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Variability in contractile properties is achieved mainly by diversification in the motor protein myosin heavy chain (MHC), 2The abbreviations used are: MHC, myosin heavy chain; NAT, naturally occurring antisense RNA transcript; VI, vastus intermedius; SI, spinal cord isolation; SOL, soleus; TSS, transcription start sites; UTR, untranslated region; Ct, cycle threshold; TBP, TATA-binding protein; RT, reverse transcription; CON, control; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA. where different isoforms are encoded by distinct genes (1Baldwin K.M. Haddad F. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 2Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Of this family of eight MHC genes, six are tandemly linked and span ∼420 kb in the rat on chromosome 10, with embryonic MHC situated at the most 5′ end, sequentially followed by IIa, IIx, IIb, neonatal, and extraocular MHC. β (or type I) and α MHCs are located tandemly on separate chromosomes (chromosome 14 in the rat); they span ∼50 kb and are separated by 4.5 kb. Interestingly, the genomic order and orientation on the chromosomes of the MHC genes are conserved in all mammalian species, leading researchers to suspect that this organization might be an important feature in the strategy for the coordinated regulation of these genes (2Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 5Weiss A. McDonough D. Wertman B. Acakpo-Satchivi L. Montgomery K. Kucherlapati R. Leinwand L. Krauter K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2958-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Types I, IIa, IIx, and IIb, in respective order of increasing ATPase activity, are the four predominately expressed MHC isoforms in adult rat skeletal muscle. MHC gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional/pre-translational level (6Haddad F. Qin A.X. Zeng M. McCue S.A. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 85: 2227-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Huey K.A. Roy R.R. Baldwin K.M. Edgerton V.R. Muscle Nerve. 2001; 24: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Such expression occurs in a way so that the isoform profile is dynamically altered to presumably confer optimal function in the animal in response to varying conditions (6Haddad F. Qin A.X. Zeng M. McCue S.A. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 85: 2227-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Huey K.A. Roy R.R. Baldwin K.M. Edgerton V.R. Muscle Nerve. 2001; 24: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the adult rodent muscle, loading conditions, motor neuron innervation patterns, and hormone states determine the MHC isoform profile that is expressed in a muscle fiber. Alterations to these conditions can drive the expression profile toward either a faster or slower contractile phenotype (I ↔ IIa ↔ IIx ↔ IIb) depending on both the starting reference MHC profile of the muscle fiber and the newly imposed condition (1Baldwin K.M. Haddad F. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For example, disuse, inactivity, lack of muscle innervation, and hyperthyroidism result in a shift of the MHC profile from slow (type I/IIa) to fast (type IIx/IIb) MHC isoforms in slow muscle fibers (8Huey K.A. Roy R.R. Baldwin K.M. Edgerton V.R. Muscle Nerve. 2001; 24: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Haddad F. Arnold C. Zeng M. Baldwin K. Muscle Nerve. 1997; 20: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, increased loading state, chronic electrical stimulation, and hypothyroidism can cause the reverse transformations, i.e. a shift to expression of slower MHC isoforms in fast muscle fibers (1Baldwin K.M. Haddad F. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The embryonic and neonatal MHC genes are also under regulatory control throughout the stages of development (11Adams G.R. McCue S.A. Zeng M. Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: R954-R961PubMed Google Scholar, 13Caiozzo V.J. Baker M.J. Huang K. Chou H. Wu Y.Z. Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R570-R580PubMed Google Scholar). Thus there is a precisely controlled expression of the six MHC genes that is managed in response to changing stimuli. It is not understood how this complex and apparently coordinated expression pattern is regulated. Recently, we reported that in cardiac muscle, a switch from α to β MHC is apparently regulated by a mechanism whereby decreased α promoter activity is associated with decreased expression of naturally occurring antisense RNA transcripts (NAT), antithetical to the upstream β gene, resulting in enhanced β mRNA accumulation (14Haddad F. Bodell P.W. Qin A.X. Giger J.M. Baldwin K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37132-37138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This antisense β transcript starts in the intergenic region between β and α, and its transcriptional activity is positively correlated with that of the downstream α MHC gene. In skeletal muscle, short intergenic distances between the IIa and IIx genes (2.7 kb) and the IIx and IIb genes (14 kb) support the possibility of cis-mediated cross-talk regulation among the type II MHC genes, in a similar mechanism to cardiac MHC gene regulation involving NATs. NAT refers to RNA transcribed from a genomic locus in which an overlapping gene is transcribed from the opposite DNA strand, such that the resulting RNAs contain sequences that are complementary to each other. NATs have been identified recently as being involved in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes (15Knee R. Murphy P.R. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Kumar M. Carmichael G.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1415-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NATs have been identified in the human genome (17Lavorgna G. Dahary D. Lehner B. Sorek R. Sanderson C.M. Casari G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 88-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 19Yelin R. Dahary D. Sorek R. Levanon E.Y. Goldstein O. Shoshan A. Diber A. Biton S. Tamir Y. Khosravi R.

Their involvement in gene regulation is quite variable, and no generalized mechanism exists, but examples include transcription interference (20Chau Y.M. Pando S. Taylor H.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2674-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Prescott E.M. Proudfoot N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11507-11513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). NAT prevalence in the human genome has only recently become appreciated. For example, using computational and experimental methods it is estimated that at least 22–40% of genes have an antisense partner (18Engstrom P.G. Suzuki H. Ninomiya N. Akalin A. Sessa L. Lavorgna G. Brozzi A. Luzi L. Tan S.L. Yang L. Kunarso G. Ng E.L. Batalov S. Wahlestedt C. Kai C. Kawai J. Carninci P. Hayashizaki Y. Wells C. Bajic V.B. Orlando V. Reid J.F. Lenhard B. Lipovich L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4812-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Antisense RNA is likely a major contributor to the complexity of the human transcriptome. In view of the unique mechanism of isoform switching from α to β MHC involving NATs in cardiac muscle (14Haddad F. Bodell P.W. Qin A.X. Giger J.M. Baldwin K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37132-37138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the purpose of this study was to determine whether a different group of tandemly linked MHC genes in a different type of muscle tissue exhibits a similar pattern of regulation. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that in skeletal muscle MHC NATs are expressed. If so, they may mediate the coordinated regulation of the type II MHC genes (IIa, IIx, and IIb) in muscle fibers undergoing dynamic phenotype shifts. Specifically, we propose that in slow-type antigravity muscles of rats, inactivity induced by 7 days of spinal cord isolation (SI) causes shifts in MHC that are the result of coordinated regulation between the IIa and IIx MHC genes and involve NATs that are antithetical to the IIa MHC gene, which acts to inhibit IIa MHC gene expression. Type II MHC RNA transcripts were examined in the vastus intermedius (VI) and soleus (SOL) muscles of CON and SI rats using a RT-PCR-based approach. As hypothesized, NATs to the type II MHC genes were detected in these muscles that are the transcriptional products of the opposite DNA strand of the MHC genes. Our findings are consistent with a negative regulatory role for NATs on IIa MHC gene expression, and evidence suggests a NAT-mediated strategy may be important to the coordinated regulation of the IIa and IIx MHC genes. NATs to the IIx and IIb MHC genes were also discovered. Although the precise mechanism of action for these NATs cannot currently be determined, a model for their role is discussed. Animal Model—Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (240 ± 4 g) were used for all experiments. Slow muscle MHC remodeling was induced by SI. For the SI procedure the spinal cords of six animals were transected at both a mid-thoracic and the high sacral level, and a bilateral dorsal rhizotomy was performed between the two transection sites as described previously (9Grossman E.J. Roy R.R. Talmadge R.J. Zhong H. Edgerton V.R. Muscle Nerve. 1998; 21: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The unique feature of the SI model is that the surgical treatment renders the motor neuron pools in the isolated region of the spinal cord inactive while maintaining an intact connection to the muscles of the leg. Thus, under these conditions the muscles fail to contract and generate force; they are more or less completely inactive. The animals were euthanized at the end of 7 days, and their VI and SOL muscles were isolated, quickly weighed (wet weight), and rapidly frozen in dry ice. Muscles were stored at –80 °C until used for RNA extraction. Age-matched normal control rats were used for the control muscles (CON, n = 6). A majority of the muscle atrophy during SI occurs during the first 7 days, and significant changes in MHC mRNA expression are also detected during this time period (8Huey K.A. Roy R.R. Baldwin K.M. Edgerton V.R. Muscle Nerve. 2001; 24: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Grossman E.J. Roy R.R. Talmadge R.J. Zhong H. Edgerton V.R. Muscle Nerve. 1998; 21: 375-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This study followed the National Institutes of Health Animal Care Guidelines and was approved by the University of California, Los Angeles, Animal Care and Use Committee. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from frozen VI and SOL muscle using the Tri Reagent protocol (Molecular Research Center). Muscles of both legs of each rat were combined for RNA extraction. Extracted RNA was DNase-treated using 1 unit of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega)/μg of total RNA and was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by a second RNA extraction using Tri Reagent LS (Molecular Research Center). The MHC mRNA isoform distribution was evaluated by RT with random primers followed by PCR with primers targeting the embryonic, neonatal, I, IIa, IIx, and IIb MHC mRNAs as described previously (25Wright C. Haddad F. Qin A.X. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 83: 1389-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26di Haddad F. Maso N.A. Zeng M. McCue S.A. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In these PCR reactions, each MHC mRNA signal was corrected to an externally added control DNA fragment that was co-amplified with the MHC cDNAs using the same PCR primer pair. This provides a means to correct for any differences in the efficiency and/or pipetting of each PCR reaction. A correction factor was used for each control fragment band on the ethidium bromide-stained gel to account for the staining intensity of the variably sized fragments (224–324 bp), as reported previously (25Wright C. Haddad F. Qin A.X. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 83: 1389-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26di Haddad F. Maso N.A. Zeng M. McCue S.A. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the above RT-PCR can provide information on the MHC mRNA distribution pattern, it does not give information on how each isoform is regulated. Strand-specific RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of specific MHC pre-mRNAs and mRNAs, as well as antisense RNAs (NATs) that are of opposite orientation to the MHC genes. PCR Primers—Specific PCR primers were designed to target pre-mRNA and mRNA transcripts at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the type IIa, IIx, and IIb MHC genes as well as RNA transcripts at the intergenic regions. Primers targeting mRNA were located on two separate exons, whereas at least one of the primers targeting pre-mRNA was located on an intronic sequence. The skeletal muscle MHC gene locus sequence was obtained from NCBI Rat Genome Resources via BLAST analyses to previously known MHC mRNA sequence. The rat skeletal muscle MHC genes are located on chromosome 10, Contig sequence accession number NW_047334. 3April 15, 2005 version. The specific MHC genes were identified based on the previously identified 3′-end untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA, which are unique for each MHC gene (GenBank™ accession numbers X72589 (IIa), X72591 (IIx), and X72590 (IIb)). In GenBank™, only the coding sequence of the MHC mRNAs and the 3′ UTR sequences were annotated. Thus, the exon boundaries of the 5′ UTR were not known. This region, which confers isoform specificity for each MHC mRNA, contains exons 1 and 2 and part of exon 3. It was necessary to determine the intron/exon junctions to facilitate the design of primers at the 5′ end of each MHC gene. First, the transcription start site (TSS) was determined by comparison with known mouse MHC gene promoters and TSSs (GenBank™ accession numbers AF081358 (IIa), AF081359 (IIx), and M92099 (IIb)). Repeat sequences were masked using RepeatMasker, and then primers were designed using PrimerSelect (DNAStar). For each MHC gene, the cDNA corresponding to the first four exons was amplified by PCR using the first 20 bp of the gene for the forward primer, and the reverse primer was based on coding sequence located in the fifth exon. The amplified product was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems sequencer 3100 (University of California, Irvine, DNA Core Facility) with BigDye Terminator, version 3.1 (ABI). Exons boundaries were determined based on alignment with genomic DNA sequence, and these were used in designing isoform-specific primers for the 5′-end mRNA analyses. Information on the PCR primers is reported in Tables 1 and 2. Sequences for cDNAs corresponding to 5′-end type II MHC mRNA can be found in the GenBank™ data base (IIa MHC, DQ872905; IIx MHC, DQ872906; IIb MHC, DQ872907).TABLE 1PCR primer sequences and their specific targets and PCR product sizeTargetRT-PCR primersPCR product size5′→3′bp5′-end IIa pre-mRNAFwd: TGCTTCCCAATGCTGCCATATCTACAT295Rev: TTCCTACTGCTTCCCTTGGTCTTGTCA5′-end IIa mRNAFwd: CCTCTTACTTCCCAGCTGCACCTTCT239Rev: ACTTTCCCTGCGTCTTTGCTCTGAATaII NAT in the intergenic region between IIa and IIxFwd: ATCTTCACGGGTATTTTTGGTTT294Rev: GCTGGGGCTCATTTTCTTC5′-end IIx pre-mRNAFwd: TGCCACAGAAAGAGGGACGC290Rev: CTGGCTGTGGTGTGGCTGAAA5′-end IIx mRNAFwd: ACGGTCGAAGTTGCATCCCTAAAG263Rev: CACCTTCGGTCTTGGCTGTCACxII NAT in the intergenic region between IIx and IIbFwd: CCAAGCCCAGTAAGTACCACACTCAT395Rev: GATGCAATAAACACGCCTCTGAACAT5′-end IIb pre-mRNAFwd: GTGGCAAGGAAAAATGGCTAAATA393Rev: TGGGGGAGGGGATGAGAAC5′-end IIb mRNAFwd: AGCCTGCCTCCTTCTTCATCTGG229Rev: CACGGTTGCTTTCACATAGGACTCbII NAT in the intergenic region between IIb and NeoFwd: CTAATGAGGAGGCCACTTTGAGAA470Rev: GTATTATGTGGGCAGTCCGAGATG3′-end IIa pre-mRNAFwd: ACAGCGCCTGATCAACGACCTGA294Rev: AACCCGGGGATCATGCTAGAGTGT Open table in a new tab TABLE 2PCR primers utilized in one-step RT-PCR reactionsTargetRT-PCR primersPCR product size5′ → 3′bpAFwd: TGCAGACAGAAGAAGACCGAAAAA259Rev: GAAACAATATTTGAGAAGCACAACGATBFwd: ATCTTCACGGGTATTTTTGGTTT294Rev: GCTGGGGCTCATTTTCTTCCFwd: TCAATGACTAAGAGACCAGACCAA343Rev: CCGTTAGGGGAGTTAGCATTTAGCDFwd: CTGGTAAAAGCTAAATGCTAACTCCCCTAACG231Rev: AGATACTTAAGCCTCGACAGGTGATGTGGGEFwd: GCTTTGAGAACCGTTAGCCACATTTTACAGA198Rev: GTAGCCCAGCCCTCTCGATGATAACACTCFFwd: GATGAATGCGGATCTCACAGTCC459Rev: GAATCATCCCCTTCCCACTTCTGGFwd: GTTCGTTTGTTGGAGTGTTCATTTGT375Rev: GTTGCCTGGAGCTCTTCTGTTTCACHFwd: TTGGGAGGAAAGAATAGTCG393Rev: GAAAACACGTAACCTCCTCCTCTTIFwd: TTTTCCTATCACCAACAACTCAA304Rev: GGCATCCCTTCCCGTCCACACJFwd: TGCCACAGAAAGAGGGACGC290Rev: CTGGCTGTGGTGTGGCTGAAA Open table in a new tab One-step RT-PCR—RT-PCR reactions were performed with the One-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen), where the RT and PCR are performed in one reaction tube, with some modifications to the manufacturer's protocol. Strand specificity of sense and antisense cDNA was established by the choice of the RT primer. The cDNA of the pre-mRNA and mRNA (sense strand) was synthesized by priming with the reverse PCR primer in the RT reaction, whereas the cDNA of NATs (antisense strand) was synthesized by priming with the forward PCR primer in the RT reaction. The missing primer was added before the PCR reaction at the end of 15 min of heating at 94 °C in order to denature the RT enzyme and activate the Taq DNA polymerase. In addition to reactions targeting the sense or the antisense RNA, two negative control reactions were performed on each sample. In the first negative control, the RT enzyme was first inactivated by incubation at 95 °C for 15 min, and then PCR primers were added and PCR performed. Under these conditions, formation of a product is indicative of either genomic DNA contamination in the RNA sample and/or reagent cross-contamination. Testing for the former is important when targeting unspliced pre-mRNA, which is indistinguishable from genomic DNA. None of the RNA utilized in this study yielded products in these reactions, thus confirming the effectiveness of the DNase treatment and the absence of cross-contamination. In the second negative control, primers were omitted from the RT reaction, i.e. the RNA was reverse transcribed in the absence of any specific primers. Both PCR primers were added before starting the PCR. Product formation in these reactions indicates that the reverse transcription has produced cDNA without the presence of specific primers, which would negate the strand specificity of the RT-PCR. This second negative control was performed because we had previously observed that under some RT-PCR conditions a fairly robust PCR signal can be detected despite the absence of RT primers in the RT reaction (27Haddad F. Qin A.X. Bodell P.W. Zhang L.Y. Guo H. Giger J.M. Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H2351-H2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Self-priming of the RNA can occur during the RT reaction to yield a cDNA that can be subsequently amplified by PCR. However, under the conditions we used, all PCR primers generated no detectable product for these negative controls, thus validating the strand specificity of the amplified RT-PCR product. These one-step RT-PCR analyses were performed using 10–200 ng of total RNA and 15 pmol of specific primers in 25 μl of total volume and were carried out on a Robocycler (Stratagene). Conditions to be compared were run on the same samples under similar conditions (template amounts, PCR cycle numbers). RT reactions were performed at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by 15 min heating at 95 °C, followed by PCR cycling for a varied number of cycles (20–32 cycles). The annealing temperature was adjusted based on the PCR primers optimal annealing temperature. The amount of RNA and the number of PCR cycles were adjusted so that the accumulated product was in the linear range of the exponential curve of the PCR amplifications. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The ultraviolet light-induced fluorescence of stained DNA was captured by a digital camera, and band intensities were quantified by densitometry with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) on digitized images. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—In addition to the endpoint PCR used in this study, we performed real-time PCR (SYBR Green, using Stratagene Mx3000p) to measure certain key transcripts in order to both validate the data generated by end-point PCR and obtain higher fidelity of some of the measured differences between control and treatment conditions. For these analyses, a two-step RT-PCR system was used. The RT was performed using 1 μg of total RNA, 2.5 pmol of specific primers, and superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 10-μl reaction volume at 50 °C for 30 min. For the RT, the primer used to target the antisense RNA was the forward PCR primer, and the reverse PCR primer was used to target the sense RNA. Real-time PCR used full velocity SYBR Green premixed reagents (Stratagene), and the reaction conditions were optimized to give efficiencies of 100 ± 5% based on standard curve analyses. PCR was carried out for 40 cycles with annealing and extension temperatures both at 60 °C followed by melting curve analysis. For each primer set, PCR specificity was judged based on the presence of a single product at the end of the 40 PCR cycles, as determined by melting curve analyses showing a single peak at the product melting temperature, as well as by examination of the products after gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. Only primers resulting in a single product were utilized. For each PCR primer target, each sample was performed in duplicate (320 nl of cDNA/25 μlof reaction) along with a standard curve, which was based on different cDNA amounts per reaction, ranging from 10 to 1000 nl. Standard curves were generated via regression analyses whereby the x axis represented the log of initial cDNA amounts in nl, and the y axis represented the cycle threshold (Ct) or the cycle number at which fluorescence reached a value above an arbitrary set value. The standard curve was utilized to calculate the efficiency based on the slope and was also utilized to ensure linearity of the amplification with different initial amounts of target cDNAs. To compare initial amounts of cDNA in the two samples, the 2ΔCt method was utilized (28Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25810) Google Scholar), which assumes a PCR efficiency of 100%. In these two-step RT-PCR reactions, negative control RT reactions were performed in which the RT reaction was performed under the same condition as described above except that primers were omitted from the RT reaction. PCR gave background signals that were below 4% of the signal obtained with normal reactions. Genomic DNA PCR—Genomic DNA was extracted from rat tissue using the DNAeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). DNA was eluted with water and its concentration was determined by UV absorption at 260 nm (using a factor of 50 μg/ml per OD unit). Ten nanograms of genomic DNA were amplified in the presence of 15 pmol of primers in 25-μl reaction volumes using Biolase DNA polymerase (Bioline). All RT-PCR primers were tested with genomic DNA to ensure that they worked with similar efficiency. DNA Sequence Analysis—Rat genomic sequence (Contig number NW 047334; location, 10q24) was aligned with human (Contig number NT 010718; location, 17p13) and mouse (Contig number NT 096135; location, 11 35 cM) using mVISTA (29Mayor C.

Transcription factor binding site predictions were performed with the program TESS (30Schug J. Overton C. Technical Report CBIL-TR-1997-1001v0.0.

Differences between two groups (CON versus SI) were analyzed using an unpaired t test.

Body weight was decreased by 20 ± 2%. MHC mRNA Expression in the VI and SOL of SI Rats—The VI and SOL were chosen as the muscles of focus in this study because they are considered slow-type muscles with a predominance of slow-type muscle fibers.

https://openalex.org/W2032928525,"Splicing of the adenovirus IIIa mRNA is subjected to a strict temporal regulation during virus infection such that efficient IIIa 3′ splice site usage is confined to the late phase of the infectious cycle. Here we show that the adenovirus L4-33K protein functions as a virus-encoded RNA splicing factor that preferentially activates splicing of transcripts with a weak 3′ splice site sequence context, a sequence configuration that is shared by many of the late adenovirus 3′ splice sites. Furthermore, we show that L4-33K activates IIIa splicing through the IIIa virus infection-dependent splicing enhancer element (3VDE). This element was previously shown to be the minimal element, both necessary and sufficient, for activation of IIIa splicing in the context of an adenovirus-infected cell. L4-33K stimulates an early step in spliceosome assembly and appears to be the only viral protein necessary to convert a nuclear extract prepared from uninfected HeLa cells to an extract with splicing properties very similar to a nuclear extract prepared from adenovirus late-infected cells. Collectively, our results suggest that L4-33K is the key viral protein required to activate the early to late switch in adenovirus major late L1 alternative splicing.

Collectively, our results suggest that L4-33K is the key viral protein required to activate the early to late switch in adenovirus major late L1 alternative splicing. Most late adenovirus proteins are translated from mRNAs originating from the major late transcription unit (MLTU), 3The abbreviations used are: MLTU, major late transcription unit; MLP, major late promoter; snRNA, small nuclear RNA. which extends from the major late promoter (MLP) at coordinate 16.8 to a termination signal close to the right-hand end of the genome (reviewed in Ref. 1Imperiale M. Akusjärvi G. Leppard K. Doerfler W. Böhm P. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. Springer Verlag, Berlin1995: 139-171Google Scholar). The ∼28,000-nucleotide pre-mRNA expressed from the MLTU becomes polyadenylated at one of five possible sites, generating five families of mRNAs with co-terminal 3′-ends (L1-L5; Fig. 1A). Following selection of a poly(A) site, the primary transcript is spliced in such a way that each mature mRNA receives a common set of three short 5′-leader segments, the tripartite leader (Fig. 1A). This leader is then spliced to one of several alternative 3′ splice sites, generating a total of more than 20 cytoplasmic mRNAs. The accumulation of mRNA from the MLTU is subjected to a temporal regulation at the levels of transcription elongation, poly(A) site choice and alternative 3′ splice site selection (reviewed in Ref. 1Imperiale M. Akusjärvi G. Leppard K. Doerfler W. Böhm P. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. Springer Verlag, Berlin1995: 139-171Google Scholar). Thus, during the early phase of infection the MLP is active at a level comparable with the other early transcription units, whereas the same promoter accounts for most of the transcriptional activity at late times of infection (2Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Lewis J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 265-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 3Shaw A.R. Ziff E.B. Cell. 1980; 22: 905-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, at early times transcription initiated at the MLP decreases gradually over a large region beginning after the L1 unit, with few RNA polymerases extending beyond the L3 polyadenylation sequence (4Iwamoto S. Eggerding F. Falck-Pederson E. Darnell J.E. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 112-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At late times, this block in elongation is alleviated and transcripts initiated at the MLP continue to the right hand end of the genome. The control of MLTU transcription is further regulated by events taking place at the level of poly(A) and alternative 3′ splice site selection (2Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Lewis J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 265-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 5Akusjärvi G. Persson H. Nature. 1981; 292: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Nevins J.R. Wilson M.C. Nature. 1981; 290: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, although nuclear transcription proceeds across at least the L1, L2 and L3 poly(A) sites at early times of infection, only mRNAs from the L1 region accumulate in the cytoplasm. We have further shown that at a transient stage following initiation of DNA replication mRNAs from both the L1 and L4 regions are expressed (7Larsson S. Svensson C. Akusjärvi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The significance of this initial burst of L4 mRNA expression has previously not been understood. However, a recent paper by Farley et al. (8Farley D.C. Brown J.L. Leppard K.N. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1782-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) appears to provide an important clue to resolve this mystery. In this paper Leppard and colleagues (8Farley D.C. Brown J.L. Leppard K.N. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1782-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) presented evidence suggesting that the L4-33K protein may play a decisive role in the early to late switch in mRNA expression from the MLTU by stimulating MLTU cytoplasmic mRNA accumulation. The authors suggested that L4-33K most likely exerted its effect at a post-transcriptional level (polyadenylation and/or splicing), although alternative mechanisms such as RNA export or RNA stability could not be excluded. Here we conclusively show that the L4-33K protein functions as a virus-encoded alternative RNA splicing factor that both in vivo and in vitro regulates alternative splicing. To study its mode of action we used the L1 unit as a model substrate (Fig. 1). In the L1 unit a common 5′ splice site can be joined to two alternative 3′ splice sites, resulting in the formation of the so-called 52,55K (proximal 3′ splice site) or IIIa (distal 3′ splice site) mRNAs (Fig. 1). Early during infection the 52,55K 3′ splice site is exclusively used, whereas the IIIa 3′ splice site is activated in late virus-infected cells (reviewed in Ref. 9Akusjärvi G. Stevenin J. Böhm P. Adenoviruses: Model and Vectors in Virus Host Interaction. Springer Verlag, Berlin2003: 253-286Google Scholar). Previous work has identified two cis-acting elements which appear to be critical for the temporal regulation of IIIa 3′ splice site usage (Fig. 1): the 49-nucleotide-long IIIa repressor element (the 3RE, Ref. 10Kanopka A. Mühlemann O. Akusjärvi G. Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), which binds the SR family of splicing factors, and the 28-nucleotide-long IIIa virus infection-dependent splicing enhancer (the 3VDE, Ref. 11Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which up to this study functioned by an unknown mechanism. We have previously shown that the 3VDE is the most critical element conferring the enhanced splicing phenotype of the IIIa pre-mRNA in nuclear extracts prepared from late virus infected cells (Ad-NE). The 3VDE consists of the IIIa branch point sequence, pyrimidine tract, and AG dinucleotide. Current results have suggested that the splicing enhancer activity of the 3VDE may operate through an U2AF-independent mechanism (11Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Lutzelberger M. Backström E. Akusjärvi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25478-25484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In our working hypothesis we have proposed that a novel factor, of viral and/or cellular origin, the 3VDE interacting factor (3VDF), replaces U2AF as the pyrimidine tract binding factor in late-infected cells (9Akusjärvi G. Stevenin J. Böhm P. Adenoviruses: Model and Vectors in Virus Host Interaction. Springer Verlag, Berlin2003: 253-286Google Scholar). Here we show that L4-33K functions as a strong activator of constitutive IIIa splicing in vitro and of L1 alternative splicing both in vivo and in vitro. Most interestingly, this protein alone appears to be sufficient to convert a nuclear extract prepared from uninfected HeLa cells (HeLa-NE) to an extract with splicing properties almost identical to that observed in Ad-NE. Furthermore, we show that the 3VDE is the major cis-acting element responsible for this activation. Collectively, these results suggest that the L4-33K protein is the only viral component of 3VDF. Plasmids and Transcript Synthesis—All plasmids encoding for transcripts used in this study have previously been described (see supplemental data for details and supplemental references). Radiolabeled pre-mRNAs were generated by T7 transcription using linearized plasmid DNA or PCR amplified products (for protocols, see Refs. 12Lutzelberger M. Backström E. Akusjärvi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25478-25484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar and 13Mühlemann O. Akusjärvi G. Wold W.S.M. Adenovirus Methods and Protocols. 21. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 203-216Google Scholar). Cloning strategies and additional information about plasmid constructed for this project can be found in the supplementary section. Briefly, in pTripL1,L2 the MLP drives synthesis of a precursor RNA consisting of a complete tripartite leader cDNA followed by the genomic sequences encoding the L1 and L2 units. Plasmid pcDNA3-L4-33K contains the Ad5 genomic DNA fragment encoding the L4-33K gene. The L4-33K protein expressed will contain a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope tag. For bacterial expression an Ad5 L4-33K cDNA was inserted into plasmid pET-24a (Novagen) resulting in the production of an L4-33K protein containing a carboxyl-terminal His-tag. Purification of Recombinant His-tagged Proteins—Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and purified under native conditions by standard nickel column chromatography essentially as described by the manufacturer (Novagen) with the following changes. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 300 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors (complete mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). The packed column was washed in 20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 300 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 40 mm Imidazole and proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, and 500 mm imidazole. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8, and 0.5 mm dithiotreitol and stored at –20 °C. The final protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Boston1995Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. In Vitro Splicing—Nuclear extracts prepared from uninfected (HeLa-NE) or adenovirus infected (Ad-NE) HeLa spinner cells were made as described previously (13Mühlemann O. Akusjärvi G. Wold W.S.M. Adenovirus Methods and Protocols. 21. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 203-216Google Scholar). Standard splicing reaction mixtures (12Lutzelberger M. Backström E. Akusjärvi G. J. Biol.

Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 203-216Google Scholar) were incubated at 30 °C for 60–120 min in a total volume of 25 μl with or without 0.75–30 pmol of a recombinant His-tagged L4-33K protein. Splicing products were resolved on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. All splicing reactions were performed multiple times with at least three different batches of HeLa-NE or Ad-NE. Spliceosome Assembly—Standard splicing reactions were set up as described above. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 15–45 min and then mixed with heparin (final concentration: 0.5 μg/ml) and resolved on a native 3.5% (60:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel. ATP Depletion—Before addition of transcript to the in vitro splicing reactions 2 mm glucose and 10 units of hexokinase (Roche Applied Science) was added and preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C. U2 snRNA Depletion—Oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage of U2 snRNA in HeLa-NE was performed as described previously (15Lamond A.I. Sproat B.S. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing, A Practical Approach. 135. 2 vols., IRL Press, Oxford1994: 103-140Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were E15 directed against the 5′-end of the U2 snRNA and R5S directed toward the 5 S rRNA (16Black D.L. Chabot B. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1985; 42: 737-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection—Subconfluent monolayers of 293 cells grown on 60-mm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) were transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) with plasmid pTripL1,L2 and increasing amounts of pcDNA3-L4-33K. Cells were harvested 40 h post-transfection and lysed in IsoB-Nonidet P-40 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.15 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice. Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared by phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25: 24:1) extraction. L1 Northern Blot Analysis—4 μg of total cytoplasmic RNA were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.4 m formaldehyde, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized with the Ad2 pHindI fragment DNA-probe 32P-labeled by random priming (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Boston1995Google Scholar). L4-33K Activates L1 Alternative 3′ Splice Site Selection Both in Vivo and in Vitro—Farley et al. (8Farley D.C. Brown J.L. Leppard K.N. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1782-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed that L4-33K activates many, if not all, of the alternative 3′ splice sites present in the MLTU. To investigate whether L4-33K, under our experimental conditions, reproduced the early to late switch in L1 mRNA accumulation we cotransfected 293 cells with plasmid pTripL1,L2 and increasing amounts of pcDNA3-L4-33K. Total cytoplasmic RNA was prepared 40 h post-transfection and L1 mRNA accumulation visualized by Northern blot analysis. As expected from previous results, transfection of the pTripL1,L2 plasmid alone resulted in an exclusive 52,55K mRNA accumulation (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Co-transfection of the L4-33K expressing plasmid, pcDNA3-L4-33K, resulted in a dose-dependent increase in IIIa mRNA accumulation (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–6). Note that this increase in IIIa mRNA accumulation does not occur at the expense of 52,55K mRNA accumulation. Thus, the activation of IIIa splicing does not necessarily result from a shift in L1 3′ splice site usage but rather an activation of IIIa 3′ splice site usage (see “Discussion”). To directly demonstrate that L4-33K regulates gene expression at the level of alternative splicing we tested the activity of a recombinant L4-33K protein in an in vitro splicing assay. As a substrate we used a mini-52-3a transcript (10Kanopka A. Mühlemann O. Akusjärvi G. Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In this transcript the 52,55K 3′ splice site has been brought in close proximity to the two regulatory elements controlling IIIa 3′ splice site usage (3RE and 3VDE; Fig. 1) by a deletion taking out almost the entire 52,55K open reading frame. As shown in Fig. 2B, incubation of the mini-52-3a transcript in HeLa cell nuclear extracts (HeLa-NE) resulted in an exclusive 52,55K 3′ splice site usage (lane 2). Complementing the HeLa-NE with the recombinant L4-33K protein resulted in a significant activation of distal IIIa 3′ splice site usage (lane 3). This activation was concentration-dependent and reproduced in multiple experiments (data not shown). It is interesting to note that the shift in L1 alternative splicing, although relatively weak, was essentially as efficient as that observed in nuclear extracts prepared from adenovirus late infected cells (Ad-NE) (lane 1). Based on this result, we conclude that L4-33K indeed functions at the level of RNA splicing and acts as a virus-encoded alternative RNA splicing factor. Signature of 3′ Splice Sites Activated by L4-33K—Since L4-33K activates IIIa 3′ splice site usage in an in vitro assay with only a modest stimulatory effect on 52,55K 3′ splice site usage (Fig. 2B), the results suggest that L4-33K may have a specificity in 3′ splice site activation. To test this possibility a panel of splicing substrates of different origin were tested in the in vitro splicing assay in HeLa-NE supplemented with L4-33K. The substrates that are derived from the MLTU L1 to L4 regions (52,55K, IIIa, penton, pV, pVII, hexon, and 100K) have their different 3′ splice sites cloned downstream of an identical first exon cassette containing the natural third leader 5′ splice site (17Mühlemann O. Kreivi J.P. Akusjärvi G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7324-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The additional transcripts, AdML, Drosophila Ftz and M-Tra, rabbit β-globin, and mouse IgM are standard substrate RNAs with differences in their intrinsic 3′ splice site strength. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, the different transcripts can be subdivided into three groups based on their responsiveness to L4-33K: group 1; strongly activated (IIIa, pV, and pVII); group 2, weakly activated (hexon, IgM, and 52,55K); group 3, nonresponsive (AdML, penton, 100K, globin, Ftz, and M-Tra). The IIIa, pV, and pVII transcripts are by far the most responsive transcripts with activation levels reaching up to 40-fold in many experiments whereas the weakly activated transcripts were stimulated between 2- and 5-fold. In general, the results suggest a reasonably good correlation between the strength of the 3′ splice site and L4-33K responsiveness, with strong 3′ splice sites containing long pyrimidine tracts being non-responsive and weak 3′ splice sites with nonconsensus type of pyrimidine tracts being highly or weakly activated by L4-33K (Fig. 3B; see also “Discussion”). The results further support our conclusion (Fig. 2) that L4-33K activates splicing through a mechanism that operates via the strength of the 3′ splice site. Thus, transcripts 52,55K, IIIa, penton, pV, pVII, hexon, and 100K, which show a great variation in their responsiveness to L4-33K, all have the same first exon and 5′ splice site and differ from each other in the composition of the 3′ splice site region. The 3VDE Is the Major Element Mediating L4-33K Activation of Splicing—Next, we analyzed the effect of L4-33K on IIIa pre-mRNA splicing in more detail. As shown in Fig. 4B, addition of increasing amounts of the recombinant L4-33K protein to HeLa-NE resulted in a dose-dependent increase in IIIa splicing with a maximum level of splicing reached around 6–12 pmol of L4-33K (lanes 5 and 6). Interestingly, at these concentrations the level of IIIa splicing was similar to what we typically observe in Ad-NE (lane 1). To map the critical element(s) responsible for the splicing enhancer activity of L4-33K we added a fixed amount of recombinant L4-33K protein to chimeric transcripts where short sequences in the IIIa pre-mRNA was replaced by the corresponding sequence element from the β-globin pre-mRNA (Fig. 4A). It should be noted that β-globin splicing is not activated by the L4-33K protein (Fig. 3B, lane 20). As shown in Fig. 4C, removal of the 3RE from the IIIa transcript (IIIa (Δ3RE)) resulted in an increase in the basal level of splicing, compared with the wild type transcript (compare lanes 1 and 3). This result was expected, since the 3RE represses IIIa splicing by binding the SR family of splicing factors (10Kanopka A. Mühlemann O. Akusjärvi G. Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Transcript IIIa (Δ3RE) was activated to higher levels compared with the wild type IIIa transcript by L4-33K (lanes 2 and 4). In agreement with our previous results (11Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), replacing the 3VDE with the corresponding element from β-globin also resulted in a significant increase in basal IIIa (Δ3VDE) splicing (compare lanes 1 and 5). The IIIa (Δ3VDE) transcript was also activated by L4-33K (lane 6), although not to the same extent as IIIa (Δ3RE). A double mutant (IIIa (Δ3RE,3VDE), lanes 7 and 8) showed, as expected, an even higher basal splicing activity in HeLa-NE, an activity that was not stimulated by L4-33K. To examine whether the failure of the L4-33K protein to stimulate IIIa (Δ3RE,3VDE) splicing was due to a saturation of splicing we studied the IIIa (Δ3RE,3VDE) transcript in a time course experiment. As shown in Fig. 4D, the kinetic and efficiency of IIIa (Δ3RE,3VDE) splicing was very similar with (lanes 7–12) or without (lanes 1–6) optimal amounts of the recombinant L4-33K protein. Taken together, these results suggest that the 3VDE is the major element mediating L4-33K activation of splicing, with a smaller contribution made by the 3RE. To test this hypothesis further we used chimeric transcripts where the 3RE and the 3VDE were used to replace the corresponding sequences in the β-globin pre-mRNA (Fig. 5A). As expected from our previous results transfer of the 3RE (Fig. 5B, lane 3) or the 3VDE (Fig. 5B, lane 5) to β-globin resulted in a dramatic reduction in basal β-globin splicing (10Kanopka A. Mühlemann O. Akusjärvi G. Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 11Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 5B, addition of L4-33K to either of these transcripts resulted in an activation of β-globin splicing (lanes 4 and 6). In agreement with the conclusion drawn from the IIIa hybrid constructs (Fig. 4) L4-33K activated glob (3VDE) (lane 6) more efficiently than glob (3RE) (lane 4), reinforcing the conclusion that the 3VDE is the major element mediating L4-33K activation of splicing in vitro. Transfer of both 3RE and 3VDE to β-globin (lane 7) resulted, as expected (11Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), in a strong repression of basal splicing activity. However, this transcript was activated by L4-33K (lane 8), although its induced activity was very low. L4-33K Stimulates Spliceosome Assembly—To gain additional support that L4-33K activates splicing directly, we analyzed spliceosome assembly in HeLa-NE supplemented with the recombinant L4-33K protein. As shown in Fig. 6A, incubation of the IIIa pre-mRNA in HeLa-NE supplemented with the L4-33K protein resulted in a dramatic increase in pre-spliceosomal A complex formation (compare lanes 1 and 3). Slower migrating species corresponding to spliceosomal complexes B and C were not readily discernible except possibly in the sample supplemented with L4-33K (lane 3). This finding was not unexpected, since we have previously noted that the B and C complexes are very unstable on this transcript and difficult to resolve by native gel electrophoresis (18Kreivi J.P. Akusjärvi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The accumulation of the A complex was dependent on spliceosome assembly, since U2 snRNA depletion by oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage abolished complex formation (lanes 2 and 4). Furthermore, depleting HeLa-NE of ATP also eliminated A complex formation (Fig. 6B, lane 2), while readdition of ATP to the depleted extract restored spliceosomal A complex formation (Fig. 6B, lane 3). Collectively, these results provide strong support for the conclusion that L4-33K stimulates IIIa mRNA splicing by enhancing an early step in spliceosome assembly. The RS Peptides Are Required for the L4-33K Splicing Enhancer Activity—To map functional regions of L4-33K deletion mutants were constructed in which different parts of the N terminus were deleted (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B, a deletion removing the acidic amino terminus did not have any negative effects on the splicing enhancer activity of the protein (Δ1–55; lane 3). A further truncation removing the 106 amino acids encoded by the L4-33K first exon reduced the activity of the protein to ∼30% of wild type (Δ1–106; lane 4). A further truncation preserving only the conserved carboxyl-terminus of the protein still retained ∼30% of the splicing enhancer activity of the wild type protein (Δ1–157; lane 5). Collectively these results show that the 157 amino-terminal amino acids are not essential for the splicing enhancer activity of L4-33K. However, the region spanning amino acid 55–106 appears to encode a signal that augment the activity of the protein. During the cloning of a cDNA for the L4-33K mRNA we found a novel mRNA generated by a double splicing event. The novel intron is flanked by authentic 5′ and 3′ splicing signals and appears to be a bona fide authentic intron. However, a quantitation of the expression levels of the double spliced L4-33K mRNA suggests that it is a rare mRNA that most likely is not crucial for virus growth, at least not during virus growth in tissue culture cells (supplemental Fig. 1). The novel splicing event causes an in-frame deletion of 27 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal part of the L4-33K protein (Fig. 7A). We refer to this new protein variant as the L4-33Kds protein. As shown in Fig. 7C, L4-33Kds was completely unable to stimulate IIIa splicing (lane 9), suggesting that this protein domain is essential for the splicing enhancer activity of L4-33K. Interestingly, this protein domain encodes for three RS and one SR dipeptide (Fig. 7A). Such protein motifs have previously been characterized as signature modules for cellular splicing factors or splicing related factors (19Bourgeois C.F. Lejeune F. Stevenin J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 37-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Blencowe B.J. Bowman J.A. McCracken S. Rosonina E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, L4-33K does not complement splicing in S100 extracts, suggesting that it is not a classical SR protein (data not shown). To examine whether the RS motifs were required for the IIIa splicing enhancer activity of L4-33K we constructed a collection of serine to glycine substitution mutants of L4-33K (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7C, mutating serine 176, 189, or 196 individually did not have any adverse effect on the L4-33K splicing enhancer activity (lanes 3, 4, and 6). However, mutating serine 192 completely annulled the splicing enhancer phenotype of L4-33K (lane 5). Interestingly, combining serine mutations that individually did not show a phenotype created proteins with severe splicing defects. Thus, a triple mutant changing serines 176, 189, and 196 (lane 7) or a double mutant changing serines 176 and 189 (lane 8) were essentially inactive as IIIa splicing enhancer proteins. Taken together these results are compatible with the conclusion that the RS dipeptide motifs in L4-33K may be significant for activity with serine 192 being essential for activity and serines 176, 189, and 196 serving redundant functions. Here we show that the adenovirus L4-33K protein functions as a virus-encoded alternative splicing factor, selectively enhancing splicing of transcripts containing weak 3′ splice sites. L4-33K activates IIIa splicing mainly through the 3VDE element, which we previously have shown is the minimal element, both necessary and sufficient, for activating splicing in Ad-NE (11Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The results presented suggest that L4-33K is the only viral protein necessary to mediate the temporal activation of major late pre-mRNA splicing observed at late times of infection. A comparison of the splicing efficiency of the different transcripts used in this study gives a clear indication that transcripts with a high basal activity in HeLa-NE (AdML, penton, 100K, globin, and Ftz) are not stimulated by L4-33K (Fig. 3B). This finding is also reproduced at the level of sequence features surrounding the 3′ splice site (Fig. 3A). Thus, the common feature of the highly and weakly activated 3′ splice sites is that they have a very low basal activity in HeLa-NE in the absence of L4-33K. Generally, these transcripts also have poor pyrimidine tracts that have been shown (IIIa and pV, Ref. 17Mühlemann O. Kreivi J.P. Akusjärvi G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7324-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or are expected to bind U2AF inefficiently. In contrast, all the non-responsive transcripts have polypyrimidine tracts that would be predicted to bind U2AF efficiently. The notable exception is the 52,55K 3′ splice site, which has an extended pyrimidine tract that is interrupted by one G residue (Fig. 3A) and binds U2AF with an ∼10-fold higher efficiency compared with the IIIa 3′ splice site (17Mühlemann O. Kreivi J.P. Akusjärvi G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7324-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This transcript has a moderate basal activity and is weakly stimulated by L4-33K (Fig. 3B). Here we show that the major IIIa cis-acting element mediating L4-33K activation of splicing is the 3VDE (Figs. 4 and 5). This finding should be considered together with our previous observation that the critical sequence within the 3VDE-mediating enhanced IIIa splicing in Ad-NE is the IIIa pyrimidine tract (11Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a finding that suggests that a factor must interact with the IIIa pyrimidine tract to stimulate IIIa splicing. Collectively, our results strongly argue that the L4-33K protein is 3VDF or at least the central viral component in a hypothetical multiprotein complex enhancing splicing through the 3VDE. Our preliminary results suggest that L4-33K does not bind directly to the 3VDE (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that 3VDF is a complex consisting of an alternative cellular splicing factor that makes the direct contact with the 3VDE and indirectly recruits L4-33K to the 3VDE. Alternatively, L4-33K may function by a hit and run mechanism and transiently interact and post-translationally modify a cellular factor that stimulates IIIa splicing. The next step will be to identify L4-33K interacting partners and to determine whether L4-33K is a stable component of the early spliceosome. Irrespective of the outcome of these more mechanistic studies it appears clear that L4-33K is the only viral protein needed to convert a HeLa-NE to an extract with essentially the same splicing properties as an extract prepared from adenovirus late-infected cells. It may seem unexpected that activation of the late pattern of L1 alternative splicing does not result in a shift from 52,55K to IIIa mRNA splicing (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, addition of L4-33K in vivo or in vitro results in a dose-dependent increase in IIIa mRNA production without a concomitant decrease in 52,55K splicing (Fig. 2). At a first glance this finding may seem strange. However, this result is not an artifact of our in vivo and in vitro splicing systems. The same result has also been observed in the context of an adenovirus infection. In an interesting study Gustin and Imperiale (21Gustin K.E. Imperiale M.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7860-7870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) constructed an adenovirus mutant defective in 52,55K protein expression. In this work they introduced point mutations in the 52,55K reading frame changing amino acid 18, 20, and 21 into stop codons. Clearly these mutations must have ablated an exonic splicing enhancer required for 52,55K mRNA splicing, since this mRNA was not expressed during infection. Despite the absence of 52,55K mRNA splicing this mutant virus exhibited a normal temporal activation of IIIa mRNA splicing. Thus, the temporal shift in L1 alternative splicing is not critically dependent on a cis competition between the 52,55K and IIIa 3′ splice sites. In support of such a conclusion we have previously shown that the regulated activation of IIIa splicing does not require cis competition in vitro (22Kreivi J.P. Zerivitz K. Akusjärvi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2379-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, our previous results have suggested that IIIa splicing is actively repressed in early infected cells by SR proteins binding to the 3RE (10Kanopka A. Mühlemann O. Akusjärvi G. Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), a repression that is relieved at the late phase of infection by a virus-induced dephosphorylation of SR proteins (23Kanopka A. Mühlemann O. Petersen-Mahrt S. Estmer C. Öhrmalm C. Akusjärvi G. Nature. 1998; 393: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24Estmer Nilsson C. Petersen-Mahrt S. Durot C. Shtrichman R. Krainer A.R. Kleinberger T. Akusjärvi G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 3VDE, which binds U2AF inefficiently (11Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Lutzelberger M. Backström E. Akusjärvi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25478-25484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), adds to the low activity of IIIa splicing at early times of infection. A reasonable explanation for a lack of a switch in 3′ splice site usage in L1 alternative splicing is that the 52,55K and IIIa 3′ splice sites appear to show a difference in U2AF requirement. Thus, we have shown that the 52,55K 3′ splice site, which has an extended pyrimidine tract, requires U2AF65 for activity (12Lutzelberger M. Backström E. Akusjärvi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25478-25484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast, the IIIa 3′ splice site, which binds U2AF inefficiently (17Mühlemann O. Kreivi J.P. Akusjärvi G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7324-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), appears to be spliced by an U2AF-independent pathway (11Mühlemann O. Yue B.G. Petersen-Mahrt S. Akusjärvi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Lutzelberger M. Backström E. Akusjärvi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25478-25484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, in the context of the L1 unit, two alternative pathways for 3′ splice site recognition coexist: 52,55K splicing being activated by the normal U2AF pathway and IIIa splicing activated by the L4-33K protein-induced 3VDF pathway. As much as 157 amino-terminal amino acids of L4-33K could be deleted without a dramatic reduction in the splicing enhancer activity of the protein (reduced to ∼30%; Fig. 7B). This part of the protein contains a conspicuous long stretch of acidic amino acids (Fig. 7A and supplemental Fig. 2). Although the precise amino acid sequence is not conserved between L4-33K proteins from different serotypes, the acidic nature of the amino terminus appears to be a conserved feature in human and animal L4-33K proteins. The L4-33K protein also contains a central region with two alanine stretches that could serve as hinge regions separating two protein domains that may have different functions. As we show here the carboxyl-terminus of the protein functions as a splicing enhancer domain. The amino terminus may theoretically function in other aspects of the viral life cycle (for an example, see Ref. 25Ostapchuk P. Anderson M.E. Chandrasekhar S. Hearing P. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6973-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). L4-33K contains a tiny RS repeat (Fig. 7A). We show that mutating the four serines in this motif results in a severe impairment of the IIIa splicing enhancer activity of the protein. Mutating serine 192 abolished L4-33K splicing enhancer activity, whereas individual mutations affecting the other serines did not have any adverse effects on splicing. In contrast, a triple mutant changing serines 176, 189, and 196 was defective, suggesting that they may serve redundant functions in splicing. It has previously been shown that RS dipeptide repeats may serve redundant functions in SR proteins and SR-related splicing factors. L4-33K has previously been shown to be one of the major phosphoproteins produced during a lytic infection (26Axelrod N. Virology. 1978; 87: 366-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Russell W.C. Blair G.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 34: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, SR protein kinases Clk/Sty or SRPK1 did not phosphorylate L4-33K in vitro (data not shown). Thus, we need to establish that the RS motif in L4-33K is phosphorylated in vivo and also determine whether phosphorylation of this motif is of functional significance. Since L4-33K does not appear to bind RNA, and furthermore, the length and position of the RS motif is atypical for an SR protein, it did not come as a surprise that the protein did not complement splicing in S100 extracts (data not shown). However, it remains possible that L4-33K is an SR-related splicing factor. Such proteins have been shown to play an auxiliary role in splicing mediating important protein-protein interactions with other SR-related splicing factors (19Bourgeois C.F. Lejeune F. Stevenin J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 37-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Blencowe B.J. Bowman J.A. McCracken S. Rosonina E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the observed RS motifs may be haphazard. Since the carboxyl terminus of L4-33K is the most conserved region in the L4-33K protein (Fig. 7A), the positioning of serines may play an important function in L4-33K-mediated splicing enhancement unrelated to their location in RS motifs. Collectively available evidence suggests that L4-33K, like many proteins encoded by viruses, is multifunctional and partake at several steps in the virus life cycle. Thus, the earliest studies suggested that L4-33K was required primarily for virus assembly. In one study a stop codon was introduced converting amino acid 20 from tryptophan to an amber stop codon (29Fessler S.P. Young C.S. Virology. 1999; 263: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This mutant showed no obvious defect in late mRNA and protein expression. The failure to detect a defect in mRNA expression in this study most likely resulted from a leaky reinitiation of translation resulting in the synthesis of an amino-terminal truncated L4-33K protein. Such a conclusion is supported by our observation that the amino terminus of L4-33K is not essential for L4-33K activity as a splicing enhancer protein (Fig. 7B). The second paper introduced two tandem translational stop codons in the conserved carboxy-terminal part of L4-33K (30Finnen R.L. Biddle J.F. Flint J. Virology. 2001; 289: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This mutation was lethal. The authors concluded that the mutation compromised new virus particle formation. However, it was not conclusively shown that the lack of L4-33K expression did not result in a defect in late viral mRNA or protein expression. In summary, available data suggest that L4-33K, in addition to functioning as an alternative RNA splicing factor, also may serve a direct function in virus assembly and potentially additional steps in virus replication.

OSM is produced by activated monocyte, T lymphocyte, and dendritic cell types and is also described as a potent inducer of inflammation (3Brown T.J. Lioubin M.N. Marquardt H. J.

OSM belongs to the interleukin-6 cytokine family also encompassing IL-11, IL-27, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1, cardiotrophin-like cytokine, and neuropoietin (9Heinrich P.C.

The cytokines of the IL-6 family use two- or three-membrane subunit receptors to form high affinity receptor complexes able to mediate downstream signaling events (13Boulay J.L. O'Shea J.J. Paul W.E.

These receptors belong to the type I cytokine receptors, characterized by the presence of at least one cytokine binding domain (CBD) with conserved cysteine positions and a WSXWS motif (15Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). All the receptor complexes belonging to the IL-6 cytokine family share the common gp130 signaling receptor subunit in the formation of their multimeric receptors (16Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Depending on the ligand, gp130 can either homodimerize in the presence of IL-6 or IL-11 (17Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T. Yasukawa K. Yamanishi K. Kishimoto Taga T.

The type I OSM receptor consists of the low affinity chain, LIFR, associated to gp130 (19Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosman D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). This type I receptor can indifferently bind LIF or OSM. Through this mechanism, OSM elicits biological activities overlapping with those induced by LIF, such as hepatocyte activation, bone renewal, or the in vitro maintenance of embryonic stem cell phenotype (22Gomez-Lechon M.J. Life Sci. 1999; 65: 2019-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The type II OSM receptor, specifically recognizing OSM, associates gp130 and the OSMR subunit (23Mosley B. De Imus C.

OSMR is a 150-kDa protein composed in its external portion of a half CBD followed by an immunoglobulin-like domain, a second complete CBD, and then a region consisting of three FnIII domain repeats. The cytoplasmic domain of the receptor contains motifs required for the recruitment of Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 as well as of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 signaling pathways (24Kuropatwinski K.K. De Imus C.

The interaction of OSM with its specific type II receptor mediates the unique functions of OSM that cannot be mimicked by LIF or other IL-6 family members. Signaling by the type II OSM receptor inhibits the proliferation of a number of tumor cells, including glioblastoma, melanoma, mammary, and prostatic cell lines (1Zarling J.M. Shoyab M. Marquardt H.

Soluble cytokine receptors are involved in the regulation of a number of physiological and pathological situations. They can behave either as agonists or antagonists of cytokine signaling depending on the particular family of cytokines. Soluble cytokine receptors can be generated by different mechanisms, including proteolytic cleavages of the receptor extracellular parts, alternative splicing of RNA transcripts, or cleavage of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (35Levine S.J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5343-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The soluble counterparts of α-membrane chains, such as soluble IL-6 or CNTF receptors, are able to potentiate the functional responses to their respective ligands (36Honda M. Yamamoto S. Cheng M.

In contrast, β-chain-derived soluble receptors, such as soluble gp130, neutralize the response to IL-6, IL-11, or CNTF (38Narazaki M. Yasukawa K. Saito T. Ohsugi Y. Fukui H. Koishihara Y.

In the present work we have molecularly and functionally characterized a soluble form of the OSM/IL-31 shared receptor. Cells and Reagents—All the cell lines used in this study were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. BA/F3 gp130/OSMR and BA/F3 gp130/LIFR factor-dependent cell lines were grown in the same culture medium supplemented with OSM and LIF, respectively, as previously described (39Kallen K.J.

Antibody raised against phospho-STAT3 was bought from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-STAT3 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-V5 antibody coupled to peroxidase was purchased from Invitrogen. Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-labeled immunoglobulins were from Clinisciences (Montrouge, France). Monoclonal antibodies against gp130 (AN-G73, AN-G40) were produced in the laboratory. Anti-OSMR antibodies (described in Fig. 1) were obtained following the conventional protocols after immunization of the mice with a soluble form of OSMR and by fusing the splenocytes with the SP2/o myeloma. Serum Samples—Sera from healthy humans were obtained from informed volunteers, and the sera of multiple myeloma-suffering patients were obtained from people who gave their informed consent in agreement with French legislation. ELISA Detection—For the detection of the soluble forms of OSMR and gp130, the AN-A2 (anti-OSMR) or AN-G73 (anti-gp130) mAbs were coated at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. After washes and a Tris 0.1 m sucrose 20% saturation step, the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The detection was performed using 1 μg/ml AN-V2 (anti-OSMR) or AN-G40 (anti-gp130) biotinylated mAbs in phosphate-buffered saline, bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 0.01% followed by a streptavidin peroxidase step. Visualization was performed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3)-bnz-thialozine-6 sulfonic acid as substrate and the reading performed at 405. Cloning of sOSMR Spliced Form—Total RNAs from WRL68 hepatoma cell line were extracted by the TRIzol method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified with the Advantage polymerase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using 10 nm OSMR sense primer CGGCCTGCCTACCTGAAAAC and an oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). PCR products were cloned in the pGEMT vector (Promega), and the sequencing was performed using an automatic DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter). To express the recombinant sOSMR, the 3′-end of the cDNA was replaced by a V5-His tag and subcloned in the pcDNA3.1D/TOPO-V5-His mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Protein Expression and Purification—The human embryonic kidney 293 cell line was stably transfected with sOSMR-V5-His pcDNA3.1D/TOPO plasmid using the Exgen transfection reagent (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France). Cell supernatants were submitted to an anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) before an affinity purification step using Ni2+-Sepharose column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Purified fractions were desalted by size exclusion before being submitted to SDS-PAGE silver staining and Western blotting analyses. The OSMR-Fc was a fusion protein made of the extracellular part of the membrane receptor coupled to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (34Diveu C. Lak-Hal A.H. Froger J. Ravon E. Grimaud L. Barbier F. Hermann J. Gascan H. Chevalier S. Eur. Cytokine. Netw. 2004; 15: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). In Figs. 8B and 9E a fusion protein consisting of the first 428 residues of sOSMR fused to a 40-residue linker and to the Ig domain of gp130 (amino acids 767–817) was used. The Fc and fusion proteins were expressed in COS and human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines, respectively. The culture supernatants were collected and loaded either on a protein A-Sepharose or on a Ni2+-Sepharose column and the recombinant proteins eluted. Purity and protein determination analyses were carried out by SDS-PAGE and by silver staining.FIGURE 9sOSMR associated to sgp130 neutralizes OSM-induced proliferation of OSMR type I- or type II-expressing BA/F3 cell lines. Proliferative response of BA/F3 cells transfected with type II (gp130/OSMR) (A) or with type I (gp130/LIFR) (B) receptors to OSM. Cells were cultured in triplicate with 3-fold dilutions of indicated cytokines. C and D, type II and type I receptor-transfected BA/F3 cells were cultured in the presence of 0.6 ng/ml OSM, 1.5 μg/ml sgp130, and 1.5 μg/ml sOSMR as indicated. E, 100 ng/ml OSMR-L-gp130 fused protein and 0.1 ng/ml OSM (in black) or 0.1 ng/ml LIF (in gray) were added to type I and type II receptor-expressing BA/F3 cells. After 48 h of culture, a [3H] thymidine pulse was carried out and the incorporated radioactivity determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reverse Transcription PCR Analyses—cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA by random hexamer primers using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). Reverse transcription products were subsequently amplified by 35 cycles of PCR using the primers for sOSMR (sense TCTGGGGAAAAGAAACTTTGTAC, antisense TAAGCAGGGTTCTTACTTGC), by 25 cycles of PCR using the primers for OSMR (sense TCTGGGGAAAAGAAACTTTGTAC, antisense GTACTCGCGCCATGTACTCT), and by 20 cycles of PCR using the primers for GAPDH (sense ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC, antisense TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA). Amplified products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using the LightCycler-FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). The cDNA tissue samples were obtained from Clontech. The reaction components were 1× FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I and 5 nm of the forward and reverse primers for sOSMR (forward CCTTTTTAACCTGACTCATCG, reverse AGCAGGGTTCTTACTTGCAT), for OSMR (forward AGATTGAACTCCATGGTGAA, reverse GCTTCAAGTGTGGTGAAGTT), and for GAPDH (forward GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC, reverse GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC). Data analysis was performed as indicated by Roche using the “Fit Point Method” in the Light Cycler software 3.3 (Roche Diagnostics). Quantification was made using GAPDH as a housekeeping gene. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Experiments— Cytokines and soluble receptors were preincubated at a final concentration of 5 nm each for 2 h at 37°C before being added to the cells for 10 min. Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer, sonicated, submitted to SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto an Immobilon membrane. The membranes were subsequently incubated overnight with the primary antibody before being incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h. The reaction was visualized by ECL detection according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, for 2 h before reblotting. For the co-precipitation experiments, the cytokines were incubated at a concentration of 5 nm in the presence of the same concentration of soluble receptors. After an overnight contact, the proteins were precipitated using Ni2+ beads and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Endoglycosidase Treatment—The sOSMR receptor was diluted in 1% Brij 96 lysis buffer and treated with 25 units/ml of N-glycosidase-F (Roche) for 12 h at 37 °C before Western blotting analysis. Proliferation Assays—Ba/F3 cell lines transfected with the appropriate cDNA receptors were seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells/well in RPMI 5% fetal calf serum (39Kallen K.J. Grotzinger J. Lelievre E. Vollmer P. Aasland D. Renne C. Myer zum Mullberg J. Buschenfelde K.H. Gascan H. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11859-11867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of tested cytokines or soluble receptors were performed in triplicate. After a 48-h incubation period, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well for the last 4 h of the culture and the incorporated radioactivity determined by scintillation counting (Packard Topcount luminometer, Meriden, CT). Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the AN-N2 anti-OSMR antibody or an isotype control antibody (IgG1) (10 μg/ml) before an incubation step with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Fluorescence was subsequently analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer from BD Biosciences. Detection of a Soluble Form of OSMR by ELISA—Eighteen monoclonal antibodies recognizing the soluble OSMR part of an Fc fusion protein were generated and characterized. Each of them was tested in pairs to develop a sandwich ELISA (Fig. 1A). We selected the AN-A2 anti-OSMR mAb as a coating antibody and the AN-V2 anti-OSMR mAb as a tracer antibody. The ELISA allowed the detection of 2.5 ng/ml recombinant soluble OSMR (Fig. 1B) and did not react with any other related soluble receptors (LIFR, gp130, CNTFR, CLF, IL-6R) or irrelevant receptors (soluble Drosophila Toll, soluble human IL-4R) (Fig. 1C). Moreover, addition of OSM to the samples did not interfere with the detection of soluble OSMR in the developed ELISA. We next looked for a native form of sOSMR by screening culture supernatant from different cell lines. All the tested glioblastoma, hepatoma, and melanoma cell lines secreted high amounts of a soluble form of OSMR with concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 ng/106 cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, we could not observe the secretion of sOSMR in neuroblastoma-, choriocarcinoma-, and lymphocyte-derived cell lines. In addition, high levels of sgp130 were detected in the cell lines secreting sOSMR. We also looked for sOSMR in sera from healthy individuals and from patients suffering from multiple myeloma, a pathology known to induce increased levels of circulating soluble cytokine receptors (41Lauta V.M. Cancer. 2003; 97: 2440-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). An average value of 77 ng/ml circulating sOSMR was measured in normal situations that reached a concentration of 288 ng/ml in multiple myeloma patients (Fig. 3). These results revealed the existence of a circulating form of OSMR that can be positively modulated in pathologic situations. Molecular Cloning and Expression of a Soluble OSMR Splice Variant—The cloning of a soluble form of OSMR was carried out by reverse transcription PCR starting from the WRL68 hepatoma cell line. A 1185-bp cDNA was isolated and encoded a truncated soluble form of OSMR of 394 amino acids diverging from the membrane form of OSMR by 16 amino acids encoded at the end of exon 8 (Fig. 4, A–C). The soluble receptor sequence included an N-terminal potential hydrophobic signal peptide (exons 1 and 2), a half CBD containing a WSXWS motif (exons 3 and 4) followed by an Ig-like domain (exon 5), and then a half CBD presenting four conserved cysteine residues in fixed position (exons 6 to 7). Soluble OSMR Tissue Distribution—Tissue distribution was analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using poly(A)+ RNA from different human tissues. Two pairs of primers were used, one specifically detecting the soluble form of receptor and the second one only amplifying the membrane form of OSMR. The specificity of amplified products was controlled on a large panel of cell lines and tissues, and in each case a single band corresponding to the expected molecular weight was observed on gels (data not shown). The soluble form of OSMR was expressed in pancreas, lung, liver, and placenta and weakly in skeletal muscle (Fig. 5). With the exception of heart, preferentially expressing the membrane receptor, the distribution of both forms of OSM receptors was similar in the tested tissues. Soluble OSMR Expression and Binding of OSM to sgp130-sOSMR Complex—The sOSMR was expressed as a tagged protein (V5-histidine tags) and purified by affinity from culture supernatants of stably transfected cells (Fig. 6A). SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotting analyses of the purified fraction evidenced a 75-kDa polypeptide, corresponding, after subtracting the tag molecular mass, to a mature protein of 70 kDa. Deglycosylation experiments were carried out using the N-glycosidase-F. A shift of 25 kDa was observed in agreement with the predicted occupation of 10 N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 6B). We next studied interaction between the OSM, sOSMR, and sgp130 (Fig. 7). The soluble receptors were added to OSM or LIF, and the tagged sOSMR was precipitated using Ni2+ beads. The samples were assayed by Western blotting using an anti-OSM antibody to detect its association to sOSMR. The experiments show that OSM specifically recognized sOSMR, with a slight increase of the binding in the presence of sgp130. Soluble OSMR Neutralizes STAT3 Signaling—We tested the possibility for sOSMR to behave as an antagonist for its ligands. Experiments were carried out using the GO-G-UVM and T98G glioblastoma and A375 melanoma cell lines previously reported to be responsive to OSM (Fig. 8A) (1Zarling J.M. Shoyab M. Marquardt H.

Ringelstein E.B. Halfter H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with OSM plus sgp130 showed a very slight or no decrease in STAT3 phosphorylation compared with the signal observed in the presence of OSM alone, in agreement with the published studies (42Sporeno E. Paonessa G. Salvati A.L. Graziani R. Delmastro P. Ciliberto G. Toniatti C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10991-10995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the combined addition of both soluble receptors induced a marked decrease of STAT3 phosphorylation in the studied cell lines. This was not observed in the presence of LIF or IL-6, used as controls (Fig. 8B). Recent studies have demonstrated the OSMR involvement, together with Gp130-like receptor (GPL), also known as IL-31R, in the formation of a functional IL-31 receptor complex (32Dillon S.R. Sprecher C. Hammond A. Bilsborough J. Rosenfeld-Franklin M. Presnell S.R. Haugen H.S. Maurer M. Harder B. Johnston J. Bort S. Mudri S. Kuijper J.L. Bukowski T. Shea P. Dong D.L. Dasovich M.

Netw. 2004; 15: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the possibility for sOSMR to also neutralize an IL-31 response in the T98G glioblastoma cell line (Fig. 8C). Similarly to that observed for OSM, a decrease in STAT3 recruitment by IL-31 was observed when simultaneously adding sOSMR and soluble GPL/IL-31R to the cells. Altogether, these results indicate that a combination of truncated OSMR and gp130, or GPL/IL-31R, could trap and neutralize OSM and IL-31 responses, respectively. Soluble OSMR Combined with Soluble gp130 Neutralizes Both Type I and Type II OSM Receptors—In the next experiment, murine IL-3-dependent BA/F3 cells engineered to specifically express type I (gp130/LIFR) or type II (GP130/OSMR) OSM receptors on their surface were used (39Kallen K.J. Grotzinger J. Lelievre E. Vollmer P. Aasland D. Renne C. Myer zum Mullberg J. Buschenfelde K.H. Gascan H. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11859-11867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both cell lines proliferated in a similar manner with the addition of OSM to the cultures (Fig. 9, A and B). A 50% inhibition of the signal was measured when sOSMR and sgp130 were added together to the type I or type II OSM receptor-expressing BAF/3 cell cultures (Fig. 9, C and D). In contrast, no induced inhibition could be detected when type I receptor-expressing cells were grown in the presence of LIF (Fig. 9E). These experiments show that the interaction between OSM and sOSMR/sgp130 was sufficient to lower the functional signals mediated by either type I or type II OSM receptors. OSM Up-regulates Its Own Soluble Receptor—We studied the possibility of tumor cells modulating their sOSMR expression in response to OSM. Experiments were carried out using the A375 melanoma cell line and three glioblastoma cell lines. The expression levels of soluble and membrane forms of OSMR were first determined by reverse transcription PCR (Fig. 10A). A clear induction of the RNA coding for the soluble form of receptor was observed when treating A375, GO-G-UVM, and U87MG cells with OSM. Importantly, no variation in the expression level of the membrane form of the receptor could be evidenced in any"

There are three genetically distinct MAPKs in mammals, consisting of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK (p38). All three members are activated by dual phosphorylation of the conserved TXY motif and then phosphorylate their respective substrates on serine or threonine residues (1Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M.

Likewise, loss of p38 activation leads to an increase in tumorigenesis because of a cell cycle defect (20Brancho D. Tanaka N. Jaeschke A. Ventura J.J. Kelkar N. Tanaka Y. Kyuuma M. Takeshita T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). These findings clearly suggest that p38 activity in tumor cells regulates tumor progression and metastasis. However, there is no in vivo confirmation of a pathophysiological role of p38 in hosts during tumor metastasis. To elucidate this point, we used p38α+/- mice to examine the in vivo role of p38α during tumor metastasis. Here, we showed that tumor metastasis is suppressed in p38α+/- mice. Experimental Animals—The use of animals in all of our experiments was in accordance with the guidelines for animal care of Chiba University and RIKEN. Female mice heterozygous for targeted disruption of the p38α gene (6Tamura K. Sudo T. Senftleben U. Dadak A.M. Johnson R. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 102: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) were crossed with C57BL/6J male mice (Saitama Experimental Animal Supply Co.) to generate p38α+/- and p38α+/+ (wild-type; WT) mice. Offspring (>8 generations) were genotyped by PCR analysis of tail-derived DNA. Multiplex PCR with three primers per reaction was used. The primers were as follows: A, 5′-CCCTATACTCCCTCTCTGTGTAACTTTTG-3′; B, 5′-CCCAAACCCCAGAAAGAAATGATG-3′; C, 5′-TTCAGTGACAACGTCGAGCACAGCTG-3′. Using these primers for one cycle at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, with an extension step of 7 min at 72 °C at the end of the last cycle, produced 800- and 450-bp fragments from the mutant and WT alleles, respectively. 8-12-week-old WT and p38α+/- littermates were used for each experiment. Cells—Mouse B16 melanoma F10 (B16) cells, mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. B16 cells stably expressing β-galactosidase (B16-β-gal) were generated by cotransfection of pCMVβ (BD Biosciences) and pBLAST (InvivoGen), using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected in the medium containing 50 μg/ml blasticidin S (Funakoshi). After 2-3 weeks, clones were isolated by limiting dilution, and β-galactosidase-expressing clones were identified by X-gal staining after fixation with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Experimental Lung Metastasis Model—B16 and LLC cells were trypsinized and recovered from the medium by brief centrifugation. They were suspended with physiological saline to a concentration of 107 cells/ml. Mice (WT and p38α+/-) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of avertin, and 106 cells (in a volume of 100 μl) were systemically injected into the tail veins. In all experiments, injection of tumor cells was performed at a speed of 10 μl/min using a syringe pump (model CFV-3200; NIHON KOHDEN). 3 and 4 weeks after injection of LLC and B16 cells, respectively, the lungs were dissected out and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then they were separated into individual lobes, and the number of surface metastatic foci was counted. In the case of using B16-β-gal, the lungs were dissected out from WT and p38α+/- mice 1 week after injection. Their lungs were immersed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), followed by X-gal buffer (1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 10 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 10 mm K3Fe(CN)6, and 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS), and then embedded in paraffin and cut into sections 4 μm in thickness. The sections were placed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and blue-dyed colonies were counted under a light microscope (Axioplan; Zeiss). Tumor Growth Experiment—B16 and LLC cells were suspended with physiological saline to a concentration of 107 cells/ml. Each cell type (106 cells in a volume of 100 μl) was inoculated subcutaneously into the left flank of mice (WT and p38α+/-) under anesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of avertin. Tumors were measured along the plane of the body cavity using a hand caliper, and tumor volume was calculated as (length × width)2/2. In Vitro Binding of Platelets to Tumor Cells—Platelets were prepared from WT and p38α+/- mice by the method previously described (9Sakurai K. Matsuo Y. Sudo T. Takuwa Y. Kimura S. Kasuya Y. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2004; 24: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Then platelets were fluorescently labeled with calcein by incubation with 1 μm calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C and washed twice with Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (10 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 11.9 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.2). B16, LLC, and HEK293T cells were seeded on 8-well chamber slides and incubated with fluorescently labeled platelets at a density of 107/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. In the case of activating platelets, 1 unit/ml thrombin and 20 μg/ml collagen were added to each well just after the application of platelets. For elucidating the effect of heparin, 20 units/ml heparin (Wako Chemicals) was added to each well just after the application of platelets. After washing the chamber slides with Hepes-Tyrode's buffer twice, binding of platelets to tumor cells was examined by a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan; Zeiss). In Vivo Binding of Platelets to Tumor Cells—B16 cells labeled with calcein were resuspended and used for a systemic injection into WT and p38α+/- mice. After 30 min, the lungs were dissected out, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and frozen in Tissue Tek OCT compound (Miles Inc.). Freshly cut lung sections (10 μm in thickness) were placed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. The sections were stained with a monoclonal anti-mouse CD41 (integrin αIIb) antibody (Pharmingen) in combination with a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR)) and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan; Zeiss). The resulting fluorescence profile was analyzed by an Intelligent Quantifier (Bio Image) to quantify the fluorescence intensity of platelets adherent to calcein-labeled tumor cells. Reverse Transcription-PCR Detection of P- and E-selectin mRNAs—B16 cells were injected into WT and p38α+/- mice. As a negative control, B16-free PBS was injected into WT and p38α+/- mice. The lungs were taken from these mice 4 h after injection. Total RNA was prepared from the lungs using ISOGEN (Wako Chemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single strand cDNA was synthesized from prepared RNA (3 μg), with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using an oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl. The resultant cDNA sample (1 μl) was subjected to PCR for amplification of mouse P- or E-selectin cDNA using specific primers (for P-selectin, sense primer, 5′-TGCAGCTTTTCCTGTGATGAAGGC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-ATAGAGCCAACACCAAACTCTCCG-3′; for E-selectin, sense primer, 5′-GACCTTTCCAAAAATGGGTCCAG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-AGAGCAATGAGGACGATGTCAGGAG-3′). As an internal control, mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was amplified using specific primers (sense primer, 5′-GACCACAGTCCATGACATCACT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′). The settings of the thermal cycler were 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 59 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for mouse E- and P-selectin and 25 cycles of 40 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. For detecting P-selectin mRNA in platelets, total RNA sample (0.25 μg) was subjected to reverse transcription reaction with Moloney murine leukemia virus in a total volume of 20 μl, and then the resultant sample (1 μl) was subjected to PCR with 35 cycles. The amplified products were separated in 1.2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining under UV radiation. Specific amplification of the expected size (mouse E-selectin, 570 bp; P-selectin, 371 bp; and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 453 bp) was observed. Isolation of Lung Endothelial Cells—The lungs were dissected out from WT and p38α+/- mice and washed with ice-cold PBS three times. The tissues were cut into small pieces and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington), 2 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma), and 1 mg/ml dispase (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking. Then the tissues were suspended well by a pipette, and the resultant suspension was passed through a 70-μm nylon mesh filter (Falcon). The cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min. After washing twice with PBS, the cells suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml heparin were put on the top of Percoll solution (50% lower and 30% upper) layers and centrifuged at 800 × g for 30 min. The resultant interface fraction was collected and washed with PBS twice. The cells were suspended in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS (Type V; Sigma) and subjected to MACS separation with rat monoclonal anti-PECAM-1 (BD Biosciences) and anti-rat IgG microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec.). The isolation of PECAM-1-positive endothelial cells was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Miltenyi Biotec.). The cells were seeded on a collagen-coated 6-well plate and maintained for 2 days in CS-C medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and EC growth supplement (Sigma). After confirming over 90% purity by the uptake of DiI-acetylated low density lipoprotein, the cells were used for experiments. Western Blot Analysis—The cell lysates of lung endothelial cells (7.5 μg) and platelets (15 μg) were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-α-catenin, anti-PECAM-1, and anti-CD41 mouse monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences, Sigma, and BD Biosciences), anti-p38, anti-phospho-p38, and anti-phospho-ATF2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling), anti-E-selectin rat monoclonal antibody (R & D Systems), and anti-P-selectin goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Flow Cytometry—Liver endothelial cells were isolated from WT and p38α+/- mice by the method previously described (21Morin O. Patry P. Lafleur L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with modification. Cells were cultured for 2 days, and over 90% purity was confirmed by the uptake of DiI-acetylated low density lipoprotein and immunostaining with antibodies to VE-cadherin and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. Then cells were stained for P-selectin, E-selectin, or PECAM-1 (CD31), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat immunoglobulin (BD Biosciences). The labeled cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and rates of positive cells were quantified using CELLQest software 2.1.1 (BD Biosciences). Assay for Attachment and Transmigration of Tumor Cells— Primary cultured lung endothelial cells (105 cells) were seeded on 24-well cell culture inserts (apical chamber; Falcon) with pore size of 8 μm and maintained in CS-C medium overnight. After replacing the medium with Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen), DiI-labeled B16 cells (3 × 104 cells) were added to the apical chambers. At the same time, platelets (3 × 106) freshly isolated from WT and p38α+/- mice were added to the apical chambers for determination of the effect of platelets. As a negative control, DiI-labeled B16 cells with or without platelets were added to the endothelial cell-free apical chambers. All apical chambers were washed with Opti-MEM I twice for removing nonattaching cells 30 min after applying B16 cells to the apical chambers. Some apical chambers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for counting the number of B16 cells attached on endothelial cells by a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan; Zeiss). Some other apical chambers were further incubated to determine the transendothelial migration of B16 cells. After incubation for 8 h, nonmigrating cells were removed by scraping the apical side of the apical chambers with a cotton swab. Then the apical chambers were fixed and subjected to the examination of transmigrating B16 cells by a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan; Zeiss). Resistance of p38α+/- Mice to Experimental Lung Metastasis of Tumor Cells but Not to Tumor Growth—Two transplantable tumor cell lines, B16 and LLC, were used in the present study, because both are highly metastatic to the lung (22Zhu D. Cheng C.F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Palumbo J.S. Kombrinck K.W. Drew A.F. Grimes T.S. Kiser J.H. Degen J.L. Bugge T.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 3302-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, there was a significant difference in surface pulmonary metastatic foci between WT and p38α+/- mice following intravenous injection of B16 cells (WT, 91.8 ± 21.0 cells/mouse; p38α+/-, 9.3 ± 3.2 cells/mouse). Also in the case of LLC cell injection, the formation of pulmonary metastatic foci was significantly decreased in p38α+/- mice compared with WT mice (WT, 31.2 ± 5.4 cells/mouse; p38α+/-, 11.2 ± 4.3 cells/mouse). To explore in greater detail whether the significant reduction in surface pulmonary metastases in p38α+/- mice resulted from tumor growth, we established B16 cells stably expressing β-galactosidase (B16-β-gal) in order to visualize a small focus of B16 cells. By using B16-β-gal, we investigated the formation of pulmonary metastatic foci at an earlier time after injection of tumor cells. Also in this case, a significant reduction in pulmonary metastasis was observed in p38α+/- mice (Fig. 1C). The size of metastatic foci dyed blue was comparable between WT and p38α+/- mice, indicating that tumor growth is not impaired in p38α+/- mice (data not shown). To further clarify this notion, we investigated the time-dependent increase in tumor volume after subcutaneous tumor cell transplantation. Both B16 and LLC cells when injected subcutaneously formed tumors with 100% penetrance, in which the steady growth of tumors showed no difference between WT and p38α+/- mice (Fig. 2). These results suggest that host p38α affects the metastatic potential of tumor cells but neither tumor cell growth nor tumor rejection.FIGURE 2Time-dependent tumor growth of subcutaneously transplanted tumor cells. A, tumor volume after subcutaneous injection of B16 cells in WT and p38α+/- littermates (open circles, WT; closed circles, p38α+/- littermates). B, tumor volume after subcutaneous injection of LLC cells in WT and p38α+/- littermates (open circles, WT; closed circles, p38α+/- littermates). Data are mean (n = 6). No significant difference in tumor growth of both B16 and LLC cells in WT and p38α+/- littermates was found by Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Angiogenesis is well known to be an important process in tumor cell growth (24Nicholson B. Theodorescu D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 125-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Tonini T. Rossi F. Claudio P.P. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6549-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The microenvironment of the local host tissue appears to be an active participant in exchanging cytokines and enzymes with tumor cells that modify the local extracellular matrix, stimulate migration, and promote tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and survival. It has been demonstrated that p38 plays a role in angiogenesis via regulating the production of inflammatory mediators (26Jackson J.R. Bolognese B. Hillegass L. Kassis S. Adams J. Griswold D.E. Winkler J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 687-692PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, targeted disruption of the p38α gene results in homozygous embryonic lethality because of defects in placental organogenesis, in which angiogenesis plays a crucial role (5Adams R.H. Porras A. Alonso G. Jones M. Vintersten K. Panelli S. Valladares A. Perez L. Klein R. Nebreda A.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 109-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus, the reduction of p38 intrinsic activity in the local host tissue by a single copy disruption of the p38α gene is thought to cause some impairment of angiogenesis. However, the comparable tumor growth between WT and p38α+/- mice suggests that angiogenesis during tumor growth may not show impairment in p38α+/- mice in the present experimental model. Reduction of Tumor Cell-Platelet Interaction in p38α+/-Mice—Tumor cells are frequently observed in the vasculature in complexes with platelets, and this association, together with the hypercoagulable state of malignant disease, appears to be essential for successful metastasis. The ability of tumor cells to induce platelet aggregation is widespread among cancers, including colon adenocarcinoma (27Kato Y. Fujita N. Yano H. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3040-3045PubMed Google Scholar), lung carcinoma (28Janowska-Wieczorek A. Wysoczynski M. Kijowski J. Marquez-Curtis L. Machalinski B. Ratajczak J. Ratajczak M.Z. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 113: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), melanomas (29Im J.H. Fu W. Wang H. Bhatia S.K. Hammer D.A. Kowalska M.A. Muschel R.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8613-8619Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and others. The ability of tumor cells to induce platelet aggregation is of benefit for the survival of tumor cells for the following reasons: tumor cells coated with platelets acquire the ability to evade the body's immune system and blood flow's high shear forces; large tumor-platelet aggregate tends to embolize in the microvasculature; and tumor cells efficiently receive a number of growth factors from platelets (30Jurasz P. Alonso-Escolano D. Radomski M.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 143: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, platelets possibly act to facilitate all of the intermediate steps of transvascular metastasis, including tumor cell retention and arrest, subendothelial interaction, and extravasation from the microvasculature. We recently demonstrated that the binding activity of activated platelets from p38α+/- mice to fibrinogen, possibly mediated through integrin αIIbβ3, is suppressed compared with the case of platelets from WT mice (9Sakurai K. Matsuo Y. Sudo T. Takuwa Y. Kimura S. Kasuya Y. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 2004; 24: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This clearly indicates that the function of platelets is attenuated in p38α+/- mice compared with WT mice. Then we investigated whether p38α mediates the interaction of platelets with tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. We labeled platelets freshly isolated from WT and p38α+/- mice with calcein and applied them to B16 and LLC cells in vitro. We used HEK293T cells as a negative control and confirmed that resting and activated platelets from WT mice did not show the activity of rosetting on the cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, resting and activated platelets from WT mice rosetted on B16 and LLC cells, and this interaction was clearly reduced in the case of p38α+/- mice. Heparin markedly inhibited the interaction of platelets from WT and p38α+/- mice with tumor cells. Quantitative analysis showed that resting and activated platelets from p38α+/- mice had significantly decreased activity of rosetting on tumor cells compared with those from WT mice. The stimulation of platelets from WT mice with thrombin and collagen increased the number of platelets rosetted on tumor cells. This increase was moderate in the case of p38α+/- mice (WT, 1.8 times; p38α+/-, 1.5 times), indicating that agonist-induced activation is reduced in platelets from p38α+/- mice. The tumor cell-platelet interaction was significantly heparin-sensitive (Fig. 3B). To examine the tumor cell-platelet interaction in vivo, we injected calcein-labeled B16 cells, and those that lodged in the capillaries of the lung were further stained with anti-CD41, a defined platelet marker. As shown in Fig. 4A, platelets almost covered B16 cells in the lung of WT mice. In contrast, platelets weakly and partly covered B16 cells in the lung of p38α+/- mice. Quantitative analysis of the ratio of red fluorescence (CD41-like immunoreactivity) versus green fluorescence (B16) showed that the interaction of B16 cells with platelets in the lung was significantly decreased in p38α+/- mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that suppression of the interaction of platelets with tumor cells can affect the metastatic potential of tumor cells in p38α+/- mice.FIGURE 4In vivo interaction of platelets with tumor cells. A, typical examples of platelet clumps attached on tumor cells in the lung. WT (A-C) and p38α+/- littermates (D-F) were injected with calcein-labeled B16 cells. Lung sections were stained with monoclonal anti-mouse CD41 antibody in combination with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled secondary antibody, and B16 (A and D) and attached platelets (B and E) were determined as green fluorescence and red fluorescence, respectively, under a fluorescence microscope.

https://openalex.org/W2026349111,"αVβ3 integrins are overexpressed in the host-derived vasculature of glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and are believed to contribute to angiogenesis and tumor growth. To directly address the role of host αVβ3 expression in GBM growth and behavior, we intracranially implanted integrin β3-expressing GBM cells into β3 wild type (WT) or β3 knock out (KO) mice and monitored angiogenesis and growth. GBM in β3 WT animals had a vessel density greater than that in β3 KO animals, consistent with a pro-angiogenic, pro-tumorigenic view of host integrin function. GBM in β3 WT animals, however, were no larger than those in β3 KO animals, because GBM in β3WT animals were infiltrated with a higher number of tumor necrosis factor α-secreting, apoptosis-inducing macrophages than the tumors in the corresponding β3 KO animals. The tumor-suppressive effects of host β3 expression could be reversed by macrophage depletion or by transplantation of bone marrow from β3 KO animals into β3 WT animals, both of which significantly increased tumor growth independently of tumor vessel density. Taken together, these results show that host αVβ3 integrin expression has opposing actions in the intracranial setting, enhancing tumor vascularization and growth while independently enhancing macrophage-mediated tumor elimination. Appropriate management of these functions could lead to enhanced efficacy of anti-integrin based therapies for glioma. αVβ3 integrins are overexpressed in the host-derived vasculature of glioblastoma multiform (GBM) and are believed to contribute to angiogenesis and tumor growth.

Central Brain Tumors Registry of the United States, Hinsdale, IL2000Google Scholar). Although surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy have been shown to slightly increase the lifespan of individuals with GBM, new approaches that can selectively target the tumor are needed. The search for agents that can selectively target glioma cells has led to an interest in the role of integrins in glioma biology. Integrins are transmembrane glycoprotein complexes of noncovalently linked α and β subunits. There are 8 known β subunits that combine with 18 α subunits in a defined manner to create more than 24 unique αβ heterodimers. Although some β subunits combine with a large number of α subunits, others exhibit greater selectivity and combine with single α subunits (4Hynes R.O. Cell. 2000; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). As an example, the β3 subunit combines exclusively with the αV subunit in most tissues except in platelets, where it also exhibits a pro-clotting interaction with the αIIb integrin subunit (5Milner R. Campbell I.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Integrin heterodimers each recognize a specific range of ligands in the extracellular matrix or on neighboring cells, and integrin binding plays a key role in adhesion of integrinexpressing cells to the extracellular matrix. Integrin-mediated cellular anchorage, however, is also accompanied by linkage of activated integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and the triggering of a large number of signal transduction pathways that can influence nearly every aspect of cellular behavior (6Christofori G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2318-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 8Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Because integrins play a key role in processes requiring cell-cell interaction such as cell migration and angiogenesis, they also appear to play a key role in tumorigenesis. αVβ3 integrin complexes in particular are overexpressed in the proliferating vascular endothelial cells surrounding the tumor (9Albeda S.M. Mette S.A. Elder D.E. Stewart R. Damjanovich L. Herlyn M. Buck C.A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6757-6764PubMed Google Scholar, 11Natali P.G. Hamby C.V. Felding-Habermann B. Liang B. Nicotra M.R. Di Filippo F. Giannarelli D. Temponi M. Ferrone S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1554-1560PubMed Google Scholar). This is especially true in GBM, in which αVβ3 is overexpressed at the invasive, highly angiogenic edges of the tumor (12Bello L. Francolini M. Marthyn P. Zhang J. Carroll R.S. Nikas D.C. Strasser J.F. Villani R. Cheresh D.A. Black P.M. Neurosurgery. 2001; 49: 380-389PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion that αVβ3 integrins may play a role in the angiogenesis and/or growth and invasion of GBM. This concept has been further supported by the demonstration that monoclonal antibodies and small cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartate peptide ligands of αVβ3, both of which function presumably as αVβ3 antagonists, led to tumor regression in animal models of GBM (13Chatterjee S.

These studies as a whole have defined αVβ3 as a promising target for tumor-selective therapy of GBM. More recent detailed studies, however, have questioned the established role of tumor and host αVβ3 expression in glioma growth. We previously showed that overexpression of αVβ3in intracranially implanted GBM cells did not increase the blood vessel density or size of the subsequent tumors but, rather, suppressed both tumor oxygenation and growth (14Kanamori M. Vanden Berg S.R. Bergers G. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because the growth suppressive effects of β3 expression in the tumor could be overcome by genetic alterations (Akt activation, VEGF overexpression) common to GBM, however, these studies suggested that αVβ3 expression in the host, rather than in the tumor, may play a more important role in modulating glioma growth. The effects of host αVβ3 expression on tumor growth have been examined, and in these studies host αVβ3 expression surprisingly suppressed rather than enhanced the growth of subcutaneously implanted human tumor cells in association with suppression of angiogenesis (15Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 1: 27-34Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 16Taverna D. Moher H. Crowley D. Borsig L. Varki A. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These studies, however, were done in the relatively avascular subcutaneous setting and, therefore, might not adequately address the role of host αVβ3 integrin expression in the highly vascular intracranial setting that is home to GBM. Because angiogenesis and tumor growth are highly tissue-specific processes, both of which are greatly influenced by the tumor microenvironment (17Blouw B. Song H. Tihan T. Bosze J. Ferrara N.

Nagane M. Thorpe P.E. Rosenbaum J.S. Su Huang H.J. Cavenee W.K. Cheng S.Y. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8569-8577PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that effects of host αVβ3 expression might be tissue-dependent and far different in the intracranial versus the subcutaneous setting. We here report that tumorrelated effects of host αVβ3 expression are indeed highly dependent on tumor microenvironment and that in the intracranial setting host αVβ3 expression increases glioma vessel density while independently suppressing glioma growth by enhancing TNFα-secreting macrophage infiltration into the tumor. Manipulation of these independent opposing functions of αVβ3 expression functions could lead to enhanced efficacy of anti-integrin-based therapies for glioma. Cell Lines—U251, an established human GBM cell line, was obtained from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Tumor Research Center Tissue Bank. GL261, a mouse GBM cell line created by intracranial implantation of a methylcholanthrene pellet in a C57BL/6 animal (19Seligman A.M. Shear M.J. Am. J. Cancer. 1939; 37: 364-395Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. Y. Gillespie, University of Alabama at Birmingham. Cells were maintained as monolayers in a complete medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. An immortalized human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line (HDMEC) was provided by Dr. Gabriele Bergers (UCSF Dept. of Neurological Surgery). HDMEC cells were cultured in MCDB131 media (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1:100 l-glutamine. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2. All reagents for cell culture were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Mice and Tumorigenesis Assay—β3 integrin knock out (KO) (15Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 1: 27-34Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar) mice were intercrossed with immunodeficient mice lacking the Rag1 gene to generate immunodeficient Rag1 KO mice with or without β3 integrin expression (C57BL6/129Sv). The genotypes were confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction as described previously (20Hodivala-Dilke K.M. McHugh K.P. Tsakiris D.A. Rayburn H. Crowley D. Ullman-Cullere M. Ross F.P. Coller B.S. Teitelbaum S. Hynes R.O. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Intracranial injections of U251 and GL261 cells into mice were performed as described previously (14Kanamori M. Vanden Berg S.R. Bergers G. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Sonoda Y. Ozawa T. Aldape K.D. Deen D.F. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6674-6678PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 106 cells were stereotactically injected into striatum of age- and sex-matched anesthetized mice (14Kanamori M. Vanden Berg S.R. Bergers G. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Sonoda Y. Kanamori M. Deen D.F. Cheng S.Y. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1962-1968PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed 35 days after injection. Tumor-bearing brains were sectioned coronally at the point of cellular implantation. After hematoxylin and eosin staining, sections were photographed, and the length (a) and width (b) of the largest tumor cross-sectional areas were determined. To obtain another parameter of widths (c), samples were cut into 10-μm serial coronal sections, and every 10th section was stained for hematoxylin and eosin. Tumor volume was calculated using the standard formula (V = length (a) × width (b) × width (c) × 0.52). For subcutaneous studies, 5 × 106 cells were injected into the flank, and 25 days after injection the volume was calculated using the standard formula (width × widths × length × 0.52) (23Hagedorn M.

Mouse Bone Marrow Transplants (BMT)—Six-week-old recipient female immunodeficient Rag1 KO mice with or without β3 integrin expression (C57BL6/129Sv) were lethally irradiated with 8Gy (4Gy × 2 at a 4-h interval) and reconstituted by tail vein injection of 5 × 105 BM cells isolated from male mice generated from the same breeding pair of animals and with the same genetic background. These mice were treated with antibiotic water for 14 days. Four weeks after BMT the mice were used for further analyses. Immunohistochemistry—5-μm paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections or 6-μm frozen sections were used for immunohistochemistry. Primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were rat anti-F4/80 (Serotec, Oxford, UK), rabbit anti-TNFα (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), rabbit antivon Willebrand factor (vWF) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and rat anti-endoglin (R&D). All were used at 1:200 dilution except anti-vWF antibody, which was used at 1:800 dilution. For immunofluorescence, FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at the dilution of 1:200. These slides were counterstained by DAPI and mounted with antifade solution (Prolong, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Vessel density was assessed by counting the number of vWF- or endoglinpositive vessels in 10 independent tumor fields at ×400 with the aid of an ocular grid (14Kanamori M. Vanden Berg S.R. Bergers G. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Vessel density was reported as the mean ± S.D. In Situ Hybridization Combined with Immunohistochemistry—In situ hybridization was performed as described elsewhere (28Mahmood A. Lu D. Wang L. Li Y. Lu M. Chopp M. Neurosurgery. 2001; 49: 1196-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cDNA probe was prepared by using a PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics). Paraffin-embedded tumor sections were prepared by deparaffinization, rehydration, and digestion with proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C overnight in a hybridization mixture consisting of 50 μl of deionized formamide, 10 μl of salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen), 10 μl of dextran sulfate, 10 μl of 50 × Denhardt's solution, 10 μl of 20 × standard saline citrate, and 500 ng of denatured DIG-labeled probe. The DIG-labeled Y chromosome was visualized using anti-DIG fluorescein-conjugated antibody (Roche Diagnostics). To detect the Y chromosome-positive macrophages, slides were initially immunostained for F4/80 expression, after which in situ hybridization was performed. Flow Cytometry—FITC-conjugated rat monoclonal antibodies (rat anti-mouse anti-F4/80, Serotec; anti-NK-cell, BD Biosciences) were used to stain monocytes/macrophages or NK cells present in the blood of mice, respectively. Blood samples were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of antibody for 1 h at room temperature, treated with red cell lysis buffer (BD Pharmingen) (29Arroyo A.G. Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1996; 85: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in PBS, and analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer with CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences). Aliquots of macrophages from β3 WT and KO mice were sorted and plated onto culture dishes for further analysis. Macrophage Conditional Supernatant/Western Blot Analysis—Macrophages isolated from β3 WT or KO mice were activated by incubation with 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The culture was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 24 h. At the end of the culture, supernatants were collected, separated into aliquots, and stored at -80 °C for further analysis. The supernatant from the macrophage culture without lipopolysaccharide stimulation was used as a control. Activated macrophages were harvested and lysed as described previously (14Kanamori M. Vanden Berg S.R. Bergers G. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2751-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysate (10 μg) was subjected to gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk and incubated with antibodies against TNFα (1:1000, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or α-tubulin (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Pierce). Analysis of Cell Cycle Distribution/Annexin V-FITC Assay—Cells were harvested and washed in PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol at -20 °C. The cells were washed once with PBS followed by incubation in PBS containing 40 μg/ml propidium iodine (Sigma) and 200 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Stained nuclei were then analyzed on FACScan machine (BD Biosciences) with 10,000 events/determination. ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME) was used to assess cell cycle distribution. The annexin V-FITC binding assay was done using an ApoAlert Annexin V kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after incubation with macrophage supernatant, U251 cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized. Cells were rinsed and then suspended in binding buffer. After incubation with annexin V-FITC, propidium iodine was added to the cell suspension. Annexin V-FITC positive and propidium iodine-negative cells were counted on FACScan machine (BD Biosciences) with 20,000 events/determination. Apoptosis Analysis—For cell death analysis, DNA fragmentation (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining) was performed by using the FD Apop kit (FD Neurotechnologies, Ellicott City, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclei were counterstained with methyl green. In Vivo Macrophage Depletion—Macrophages were depleted by intraperitoneal injection of an anti-macrophage antibody (Accurate Chemical and Scientific, Westbury, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Antibody injection was begun 2 days before tumor implantation and was repeated at days 0 (same day as implantation), 2, 5, and 7 and twice a week thereafter until animal sacrifice. Preliminary tests using these antibodies confirmed that this protocol significantly reduced the number of circulating macrophages while not effecting levels of marrow-derived NK cells. As a control, rabbit normal IgG was used in the same strategy. Transendothelial Migration Assay—To assess in vitro macrophage transmigration ability, we performed transendothelial migration assays (30Weerasinghe D. McHugh K.P. Ross F.P. Brown E.J. Gisler R.H. Imhof B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 595-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, transwell culture inserts were coated with 50 mg/ml laminin for 30 min. Excess laminin was removed from the inserts and immortalized HDMEC at 106/ml were seeded on the inserts in 100 μl of medium. Cells were allowed to grow to confluence on filters for 48 h. The macrophages isolated from β3WTor β3 KO mice were adjusted to 105 cells/ml, and 100 μl of cell suspension were added per insert. Medium (300 μl) containing 125 ng/ml monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was placed into the lower chambers of the transwells, and the inserts were carefully placed into the lower chambers to avoid air bubbles forming at the interface between the underside of the insert and the medium. Migration was then allowed to proceed for 5 h at 37°C, after which the number of cells that had migrated into the lower chamber was determined. For blocking studies, anti-integrin β3 antibody (Chemicon) was added to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml. The tubes were then incubated on a shaker for 1 h at 4°C. Before the assay, cells were spun down, washed once in medium, and then resuspended in 300 μl of fresh medium. This was then added to three wells per condition. For each experiment, the number of cells that had transmigrated was expressed as the mean value of cells counted in three wells. Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test, with significance defined as p < 0.05. Host Integrin β3 Expression Has Different Effects on Subcutaneous Versus Intracranial Tumors—Previous studies have shown that host αVβ3 expression suppressed rather than enhanced the growth of human tumor cells in association with suppression of angiogenesis (15Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 1: 27-34Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 16Taverna D. Moher H. Crowley D. Borsig L. Varki A. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), although all these studies were done in the relatively avascular subcutaneous setting. To determine how host β3 expression might contribute to tumor formation in a vessel-rich brain tumor microenvironment, we implanted human U251 GBM cells subcutaneously and intracranially into immunodeficient (Rag1 KO) β3WTor β3 KO mice and monitored the tumor vessel density and size of the resultant tumors. Host β3 expression suppressed the subcutaneous growth of U251 cells (Fig. 1A) and also decreased the density of blood vessels in the tumor as detected by immunohistochemistry using antibodies recognizing the endothelial cell markers vWF (Fig, 1B) or endoglin (not shown). These results are consistent with previous reports showing host β3-mediated suppression of the growth and angiogenesis of other subcutaneously implanted human tumor cell lines (15Reynolds L.E. Wyder L. Lively J.C. Taverna D. Robinson S.D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Hynes R.O. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 1: 27-34Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 16Taverna D. Moher H. Crowley D. Borsig L. Varki A. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the intracranial setting, however, effects of host β3 expression on tumor growth and vascularity were quite different. U251 GBM cells intracranially implanted into β3 WT animals formed tumors that were no different in size from those that formed in β3 KO animals (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, an examination of vessel density showed that unlike what was seen in the subcutaneous setting, host β3 expression enhanced rather than decreased tumor vessel density (Fig. 1D), with the difference particularly apparent in the center (bottom panels, Fig. 1G) versus the invading edge of the tumors (top panels, Fig. 1G). These findings were neither unique to the U251 GBM cell line nor to the implantation of human cells into mice, because when mouse GBM cells (GL261) were intracranially implanted into the same animals used for the U251 cell studies, the mouse GL261 cells formed tumors of equal size in β3WTand β3KO animals (Fig. 1E) just as was noted in studies using human U251 GBM cells. Similarly, the GL261 tumors that formed in the β3 WT animals had a greater vessel density than those in the β3 KO animals (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that host β3 expression influences tumor behavior very differently depending on the site of tumor implantation. Host β3 Expression Suppresses Intracranial Growth in a Bone Marrow-dependent Manner—One possible explanation for why host β3 expression enhanced intracranial tumor vascularity without increasing tumor size is that host β3 expression may have growth-suppressive actions as well as pro-growth, proangiogenic actions. A first clue as to what these growth suppressive actions might be was the observation that the intracranial GBM in β3 WT animals, in addition to being highly vascular, also had significantly more infiltration of F4/80-positive macrophages than was noted in the similarly sized, less vascular tumors in β3 KO animals (Fig. 2). Although macrophages are known to contribute to tumor elimination (31Chen G.G. Chun Y.S. Chak E.C.W. Leung B.C.S. Poon W.S. J. Neurooncol. 2002; 57: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), our immunohistochemical analysis could not determine the relevance of the infiltrated F4/80-positive cells to tumor growth, the influence of β3 expression on macrophage function, or the origin of these cells. To begin to answer these questions we performed studies in which immunodeficient female Rag1 KO/β3WT (or β3 KO) animals were lethally irradiated and transplanted with the bone marrow from genetically matched β3WTor β3 KO male animals. Four weeks later U251 GBM cells were intracranially implanted into animals with reconstituted bone marrow, after which effects of β3 expression in the transferred bone marrow on tumor growth and vascularity were monitored. As shown in Fig. 3A, the size of intracranial tumors in β3 WT animals that did not undergo irradiation/BMT (bar 1) was no different from that in β3 WT animals that had their β3WT bone marrow replaced with that from a matched β3 WT animal (bar 3). Consistent with data in Fig. 1C, these tumors were also of a similar size to those that grew in β3 KO animals, which received either no irradiation/BMT (bar 2) or were transplanted with β3KO marrow (bar 6). The transplantation of β3 WT marrow into β3-deficient mice, however, greatly suppressed the growth of intracranially implanted cells (bar 5), whereas the replacement of β3 WT marrow with β3-deficient marrow greatly enhanced tumor growth (bar 4). These results suggest that in addition to exerting a pro-angiogenic, pro-growth effect, host β3 expression also exerts a previously unidentified anti-tumor effect mediated by factors transferable in the bone marrow.FIGURE 3Analysis of intracranial U251 GBM tumor size and vessel density after BMT. β3 WT or β3KO recipient female mice were lethally irradiated and transplanted with β3 WT or β3 KO marrow isolated from male littermate donor mice. 4 weeks after BMT, U251 cells were injected intracranially. Panel A, 35 days after tumor implantation, animals were euthanized, the brain was sectioned coronally, and tumor volume was analyzed and expressed as a percentage of control (18 ± 4mm3,β3+/+ w/o BMT). Enhanced tumor growth was observed in only mice reconstituted with β3 KO marrow each group. Panel B, sections were stained with anti vWF antibody, and vWF-positive vessels detected by a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody were counted in 10 independent tumor fields (HPF) at ×400 with the aid of an ocular grid. Tumor vessel density was higher in β3 WT animals than in β3 KO animals but was independent of the β3 status of the host BM.

The function of marrow-derived B and T lymphocytes is known to be dependent on αVβ3 expression (32Doucey M.A. Legler D.F. Faroudi M. Boucheron N. Baumgaertner P. Naeher D. Cebecauer M. Hudrisier D.

All experiments done in this study, however, were done in Rag1 KO animals that lack B and T lymphocytes, eliminating a possible role for these cells. The bone marrow has also been suggested to contribute cells to the growing vasculature of tumors (33Zhang Z.G. Zhang L. Jiang Q. Chopp M. Circ.

A common pathological feature of most age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including polyglutamine diseases, is the accumulation of intracellular protein deposits as inclusion bodies. Polyglutamine diseases are a group of familial neurodegenerative disorders that are caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG triplet repeats in the coding region of the target gene. These include Huntington disease (HD), 3The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington disease; SCA, spinocerebellar ataxia; tNhtt, truncated N-terminal huntingtin; UPS, ubiquitin proteasome system; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; iNOS, inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase. 3The abbreviations used are: HD, Huntington disease; SCA, spinocerebellar ataxia; tNhtt, truncated N-terminal huntingtin; UPS, ubiquitin proteasome system; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; iNOS, inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase. dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, X-linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy, and several spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and SCA17). All of these disorders are dominantly inherited (except X-linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy), progressive, usually begin in midlife, and result in severe neuronal dysfunction and neuronal cell death in the selective region of the brain (1Zoghbi H.Y.

TATA box-binding protein, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein, Sp1, and other transcription factors have been reported to associate with the polyglutamine aggregates, and this may result in their sequestration and loss of function (5Sugars K.L.

Polyglutamine aggregates also have been found to associate with various components of the ubiquitinproteasome system (UPS), and the impairment of UPS function has been observed in mutant huntingtin-expressing cells (12Bence N.F.

NFκB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates the transcription of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses as well as cell survival and cell death (21Baeuerle P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar, 23Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). NFκB is localized in the cytoplasm in an inactive form in association with a family of inhibitory proteins (IκBs). In response to multiple activating signals, IκB is phosphorylated and subsequently degraded by the UPS. The rapid degradation of IκB proteins unmasks the nuclear localization signals of NFκB, which then translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of multiple genes. The activation of NFκB seems to stimulate some pathways that promote cell death, whereas other pathways promote cell survival (22Mattson M.P. Camandola S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 23Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Several neurotrophic factors, cytokines, and excitotoxic neurotransmitters have been found to activate the NFκB pathway, and in most cases, activation leads to neuroprotection (22Mattson M.P. Camandola S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 24Sullivan P.G. Bruce-Keller A.J. Rabchevsky A.G. Christakos S. Clair D.K. Mattson M.P. Scheff S.W. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The NFκB activation in neurons is also observed in acute neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke and ischemic brain injury (22Mattson M.P. Camandola S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 27Cheng B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P.

Med. 1999; 5: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and in chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, HD, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (29Kaltschmidt B. Uherek M. Wellmann H. Volk B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9409-9414Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 33Hunot S. Brugg B. Ricard D. Michel P.P. Muriel M.P. Ruberg M.

The increased NFκB activity in the affected neurons might be an early protective response to ongoing oxidative stress or mitochondrial dysfunction (34Lezoualc'h F. Sagara Y. Holsboer F. Behl C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3224-3232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by the fact that the mice lacking the p50 subunit of NFκB shows increased damage of striatal neurons and motor disturbances after administration of mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (31Yu Z.F. Zhou D. Cheng G. Mattson M.P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We had reported earlier the impairment of UPS function in the expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cells, which might be linked with cell death. But how the UPS dysfunction leads to the death of expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cells is not well understood. Because the NFκB activation is essential for cell survival and is highly regulated by the UPS (35Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 82: 373-428Crossref Scopus (3273) Google Scholar), we investigated the possible role of the NFκB pathway in the expanded polyglutamine protein-induced cell death. Here, we report that the expression of expanded polyglutamine proteins causes down-regulation of NFκB activity and promotes expanded polyglutamine protein-induced cell death. Materials—MG132, curcumin, cycloheximide, lipopolysaccharide, proteasome substrate, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, and all cell culture reagents were obtained from Sigma. Lipofectamine 2000, zeocin, G418, and ponasterone A were purchased from Invitrogen. SN50 (peptide inhibitor of NFκB) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-IκB-α, anti-p-IκB-α, anti-NFκB p65 and p50 subunit, anti-ubiquitin, anti-iNOS, mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin, and goat polyclonal anti-Cox2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and mouse monoclonal anti-GFP was from Roche Diagnostics. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-rhodamine was purchased from Vector Laboratories and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and -rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. The source of ataxin-3 antibody has been described elsewhere (36Wang G.H. Sawai N. Kotliarova S.E. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Expression Plasmids and Stable Cell Lines—The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and truncated N-terminal huntingtin (tNhtt) expression constructs pIND-tNhtt-EGFP-16Q and pIND-tNhtt-EGFP-150Q and the generation of the stable cell lines of these constructs have been described previously (37Wang G.H.

The generation of the stable neuro-2a cell line expressing retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) also has been described earlier (37Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S.E. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The construction of plasmids pEGFP-N1-MJD(t)-20CAG, pEGFP-N1-MJD(t)-130CAG, pcDNA-MJD(t)-20CAG, and pcDNA-MJD(t)-130CAG have been described elsewhere (36Wang G.H. Sawai N. Kotliarova S.E. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The plasmid NFκB-luciferase (containing multiple copies of NFκB response elements) was obtained from Clontech. The plasmid PRL-SV40 and the dual luciferase reporter assay system were obtained from Promega. Cell Culture, Transfection, Cell Viability, and Reporter Gene Assay—The wild-type mouse neuro-2a and COS-1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin. The stable neuro-2a cell lines HD 16Q and HD 150Q were maintained in the same medium containing 0.4 mg/ml zeocin and 0.4 mg/ml G418. One day prior to transfection, the cells were plated into 6-well tissue-cultured plates at a subconfluent density. For the reporter gene assay, cells were transiently transfected with NFκB-luciferase and PRL-SV40 plasmids together using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was ∼80-90%. The cells were left untreated or induced with ponasterone A (1 μm) for different time periods and then processed for luciferase assay. In some experiments, cells were induced for 2 days, treated with different NFκB-modulating agents for 8 h, and then processed for luciferase assay. In another experiment, the neuro-2a cells were first transfected with pEGFP-N1-MJD(t)-20CAG and pEGFP-N1-MJD(t)-130CAG plasmids followed by NFκB-luciferase and PRL-SV40 plasmids. Luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. PRL-SV40 was used for co-transfection to normalize the data and transfected at a very low concentration (150-fold lower than NFκB luciferase plasmid). Data were represented as relative luciferase activity (the ratio of firefly to Renilla values). For the cell viability assay, HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells were plated into 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well). The cells were then induced with 1 μm ponasterone A for 2 days and then treated with various agents for 8 h. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously (37Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S.E. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The proteasome assay was performed as described earlier (38Jana N.R. Dikshit P. Goswami A. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11680-11685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 39Dikshit P. Chatterjee M. Goswami A. Mishra A. Jana N.R. J. Biol.

Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Experiment— After 24 or 48 h of induction, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed on ice for 30 min with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were briefly sonicated, centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants (total soluble extract) were used for immunoprecipitation as described earlier (38Jana N.R. Dikshit P. Goswami A. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11680-11685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 39Dikshit P. Chatterjee M. Goswami A. Mishra A. Jana N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29228-29235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For each immunoprecipitation experiment, 200 μg of protein in 0.2 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer was incubated either with 5 μl (2 μg) of GFP antibody or 4 μl (2 μg) of normal mouse IgG. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS (1×) sample buffer, vortexed, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by immunoblotting according to the procedure described earlier (38Jana N.R. Dikshit P. Goswami A. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11680-11685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 39Dikshit P. Chatterjee M. Goswami A. Mishra A. Jana N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29228-29235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Blot detection was carried out with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. All primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilutions for immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence Techniques—Cells grown in chamber slides were induced with ponasterone A. Forty-eight hours after induction, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, washed extensively, and then blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20) for 1 h. Primary antibody (anti-NFκB and anti-IκB-α, 1:500 dilutions; anti-ataxin-3, 1:1000 dilutions) incubation was carried out overnight at 4 °C. After several washings with TBST, the cells were incubated with rhodamineconjugated secondary antibody (1:500 dilutions) for 1 h, washed several times, and mounted in anti-fade solution. The samples were observed using a confocal microscope, and digital images were assembled using Adobe Photoshop. Degradation Assay—HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells were plated in a 6-well tissue-cultured plate and induced with ponasterone A for 48 h. The cells were chased with 10 μg/ml of cycloheximide for different time periods. The cells collected at each time point were then processed for immunoblotting using antibodies against IκB-α and NFκB p65 and p50 subunits. The Levels of IκB-α and Its Phosphorylated Derivatives Is Increased in Expanded Polyglutamine Protein-expressing Cells—We developed several stable neuro-2a cell lines in an inducible system that expresses tNhtt with normal (16Q) and expanded polyglutamine (150Q) proteins (37Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S.E. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These cell lines were named HD 16Q and HD 150Q, and their corresponding expressed proteins were named tNhtt-16Q and tNhtt-150Q. The cell lines were induced for different time periods with ponasterone A (1 μm) and then processed for immunoblotting using antibodies against IκB-α, p-IκB-α, NFκB p65 and p50 subunits, and β-tubulin. As shown in Fig. 1A, expression of tNhtt-150Q protein time-dependently increased the levels of IκB-α and p-IκB-α. There was no change of the levels of IκB-α and slight increase in p-IκB-α in the HD 16Q cells upon expression of tNhtt-16Q protein. The levels of IκB-α and its phosphorylated derivatives in the uninduced HD 150Q cells were much higher compared with uninduced HD 16Q cells. This is most likely because of the low levels of expression and aggregation of tNhtt-150Q protein without any induction (37Wang G.H. Mitsui K. Kotliarova S.E. Yamashita A. Nagao Y. Tokuhiro S. Iwatsubo T. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The levels of NFκB p65 and p50 subunit were not changed in both HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells upon different days of induction. We had reported earlier the proteasomal dysfunction in the HD 150Q cells (15Jana N.R. Zemskov E.A. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Therefore, we presumed that the increased accumulations of IκB-α and its phosphorylated derivatives might be due to the altered proteasomal function in these cells. To confirm this hypothesis, we determined the proteasome activity in HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells upon different days of induction. As shown in Fig. 1B, the expression of expanded polyglutamine proteins time-dependently reduced the proteasome activity in HD 150Q cells. This inhibition of proteasome activity correlated well with the increased accumulation of IκB-α and its phosphorylated derivatives. The slight increase in p-IκB-α in the HD 16Q cells also might be due to the proteasomal dysfunction at higher levels of expression of tNhtt-16Q proteins. The HD 150 cells also show changes in morphology upon induction compared with HD 16Q cells. The cells exhibit neurite outgrowth and look bipolar. This again might be due to proteasomal dysfunction, because proteasome inhibitors are shown to induce neurite outgrowth. Expression of Expanded Polyglutamine Proteins Increases the Stability of IκB-α—Because the levels of IκB-α and its phosphorylated forms are increased in HD 150Q cells upon induction, we assumed altered degradation of IκB-α in these cells. Therefore, we checked the half-life of IκB-α in both HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells after induction with ponasterone A for 2 days followed by cycloheximide chase. More than 50% of HD 150Q cells form aggregates at 2 days of induction. Fig. 2 shows that the half-life of IκB-α dramatically increased in the HD 150Q cells in comparison with HD 16Q cells. The half-life of NFκB p65 and p50 subunits were not affected in both HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells when they were induced for 2 days and performed chase experiments. Association of IκB-α and NFκB p65 with Polyglutamine Aggregates—Next, we searched for clues of increased half-life of IκB-α and their consequences in the HD 150Q cells. One of the reasons for increased half-life of IκB-α in the HD 150Q cells could be due to UPS dysfunction, because we have reported the inhibition of UPS function in these cells after 2 days of induction (15Jana N.R. Zemskov E.A. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The increased accumulation of IκB-α might lead to the inhibition of NFκB activity by preventing their nuclear translocation. To confirm this fact, we first performed immunofluorescence staining of the NFκB p65 subunit in the wild-type neuro-2a cells as well as in the HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells after 2 days of induction. The NFκB p65 protein was mostly localized in the cytoplasm with weak nuclear staining in the wild-type neuro-2a cells (data not shown). The expression of tNhtt-16Q in HD 16Q cells did not alter the distribution profile of NFκB p65 protein, in comparison with wild-type neuro-2a cells (Fig. 3). NFκB p65 was mostly localized in the cytoplasm in HD 16Q cells. However, to our surprise, we noticed that the expression of tNhtt-150Q protein in HD 150Q cells caused recruitment of NFκB p65 protein to the mutant huntingtin aggregates. We also observed reduction of the diffuse nuclear staining of NFκB p65 protein in these cells. Next, we performed immunofluorescence staining of IκB-α in the wild-type neuro-2a, HD 16Q, and HD 150Q cells. The HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells were similarly induced for 2 days. The IκB-α was normally distributed in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, with predominant nuclear localization in the wild-type neuro-2a and uninduced HD 16Q cells. The expression of tNhtt-16Q protein in HD 16Q cells did not alter the distribution pattern of IκB-α, as compared with uninduced HD 16Q cells (Fig. 4). The expression of tNhtt-150Q in HD 150Q cells caused recruitment of IκB-α to the mutant huntingtin aggregates, similar to NFκB p65 protein (Fig. 4). It seems that the whole NFκB complex is sequestered around the aggregates. Next, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to confirm the interaction of soluble expanded polyglutamine proteins with the NFκB p65 and IκB-α. The HD 16Q and HD 150Q cell lines were induced for 1 day with ponasterone A (1 μm) and then processed for immunoprecipitation by anti-GFP. In other experiments, we transfected the truncated ataxin-3 constructs (pEGFP-N1-MJD(t)-20CAG and pEGFP-N1-MJD(t)-130CAG) to the COS-1 cell, and after 1 day, the cells were collected and processed for immunoprecipitation by the GFP antibody. Blots were probed with anti-IκB-α and anti-NFκB p65. Fig. 5 shows that both IκB-α and NFκB p65 are specifically interacted with polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin or ataxin-3. The tNhtt-150Q or ataxin-3(t)-130Q appeared as multiple bands because of the instability of the CAG repeats.FIGURE 4Recruitment of IκB-α with the polyglutamine-GFP aggregates. The HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells were plated and induced in a similar way as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining using antibody against IκB-α. Rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody was used to visualize the IκB-α. Arrows indicate the association of IκB-α to the mutant huntingtin aggregates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Aberrant interaction of IκB-α and NFκB p65 with the expanded polyglutamine proteins. A, the HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells were plated in a similar manner as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Twenty-four hours after induction, cells were collected and processed for immunoprecipitation (IP)by anti-GFP. Blots were probed with anti-NFκB p65 (top blot), anti-IκB-α (middle blot), and anti-GFP (bottom blot). B, the COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the truncated ataxin-3-EGFP fusion constructs (1 μg each/well) containing 20Q and 130Q. Twenty-four hours after the transfection of ataxin-3 constructs, cell lysates were made and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described for A. The blots were sequentially probed with anti-NFκB p65 (top blot), anti-IκB-α (middle blot), and anti-GFP (bottom blot).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm the association of the NFκB complex with expanded polyglutamine proteins or their aggregates and to exclude any interference of GFP, we transiently transfected truncated ataxin-3 constructs without the GFP tag. At 48 h of post-transfection, the cells were processed for either immunofluorescence or immunoblotting experiments using IκB-α, NFκB p65, and ataxin-3 antibodies. As expected, both IκB-α and NFκB p65 proteins were interacted and associated with the polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3 (Fig. 6). Down-regulation of NFκB-dependent Transcriptional Activity in the Expanded Polyglutamine Protein-expressing Cells— Because the half-life of IκB-α is increased in HD 150Q cells and the NFκB complex sequestered around the aggregates, we assumed that there might be down-regulation of NFκB activity in the HD 150Q cells. As expected, the expression of tNhtt-150Q protein in HD 150Q cells time-dependently decreased the NFκB-dependent transcriptional activity (Fig. 7A). The expression of tNhtt-16Q protein in HD 16Q cells did not have any effect on the NFκB-dependent transcriptional activity. The NFκB-dependent transcriptional activity was significantly lower in the uninduced HD 150Q cells as compared with HD 16Q cells most likely because of the leaky expression and aggregation of tNhtt-150Q proteins. Next, we determined the NFκB-dependent transcriptional activity in both HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells after treating with various modulators of the NFκB pathway. We used lipopolysaccharide as a stimulator and curcumin and MG132 as inhibitors of NFκB activation. Fig. 7B shows that treatment of lipopolysaccharide increased NFκB activity in HD 16Q cells while preventing the NFκB activation in HD 150Q cells. The curcumin and MG132 both enhanced the down-regulation of NFκB activity in the HD 150Q cells. We further checked the NFκB activity in the neuro-2a cells after transiently expressing the ataxin-3(t)-20Q and ataxin-3(t)-130Q proteins. In this case, we observed activation of NFκB in polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3-expressing cells at 24 h of post-transfection, whereas we observed inhibition after 72 h of post-transfection (Fig. 7C). Possibly, the soluble expanded polyglutamine proteins are initially activating the NFκB, whereas later polyglutamine aggregates inhibit the NFκB activity. We next checked the expression levels of several NFκB-dependent genes in the HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells after different days of induction. As shown in figure 8, the expression of tNhtt-150Q proteins in the HD 150Q cells results in down-regulation of Cox2 and iNOS expression. The expression levels of Cox2 and iNOS were very low in the uninduced HD 150Q cells. This was expected, because the uninduced HD 150Q cells showed a significantly low level of NFκB activity as compared with HD 16Q cell. Inhibition of NFκB Enhances the Expanded Polyglutamine Protein-induced Cell Death—Because the NFκB activity was inhibited in the expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cells, we next checked the impact of this down-regulation on cell viability. We induced the HD 16Q and HD 150Q cells for 2 days with ponasterone A and then treated them with varying doses of SN50 (a peptide inhibitor of NFκB that blocks nuclear import of the NFκB p50 subunit protein) or curcumin. Curcumin is well known to inhibit NFκB activity (40Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). We induced HD 150Q cells for 2 days, because there was significant reduction of NFκB activity, and these cells start dying from 2 days onward (15Jana N.R. Zemskov E.A. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Fig. 9 shows that treatment of both SN50 and curcumin induced HD 16Q and HD 150Q cell death. However, the percentage of HD 150Q cell death was significantly higher in comparison with HD 16Q cells. Results suggest that the NFκB inhibitors promote expanded polyglutamine protein-induced cell death. Activation of NFκB plays a very important role in controlling the pathways related to cell survival and apoptosis. Activation of this pathway is also implicated in various acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions. In the present investigation, we have found that the expression of expanded polyglutamine proteins time-dependently down-regulates the NFκB activity. First, we have shown that the expression of expanded polyglutamine protein results in an increased accumulation of IκB-α and its phosphorylated derivatives, and this increased accumulation is because of the slower rate of degradation of IκB-α. Second, we found that the IκB-α and NFκB subunits aberrantly interact with the expanded polyglutamine proteins and sequester around the aggregates. Therefore, most likely the association of IκB-α and NFκB complexes with the polyglutamine aggregates, as well as altered degradation of IκB-α, might be responsible for the down-regulation of NFκB activity. Polyglutamine aggregates have been reported to associate with the various components of UPS (15Jana N.R. Zemskov E.A. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 20Stenoien D.L. Cummings C.J. Adams H.P. Mancini M.G. Patel K. DeMartino G.N. Marcelli M. Weigel N.L. Mancini M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and continuous expression and aggregation of expanded polyglutamine proteins in neuronal cells lead to the impairment of UPS function (12Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar, 15Jana N.R. Zemskov E.A. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Therefore, the altered degradation of IκB-α could be due to the proteasomal dysfunction in the expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cells. Aberrant association of IκB-α with the polyglutamine aggregates could also increase its half-life. Expanded polyglutamine proteins are very unstable and quickly form aggregates (41Perutz M.F. Johnson T. Suzuki M. Finch J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5355-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), and during this process, they co-aggregate with many other proteins essential for normal cellular function. Among them, several transcription factors, such as TATA box-binding protein, CREB-binding protein, Sp1, and p53 have been found to associate with aggregates and result in their transcriptional deregulation, which ultimately leads to cellular dysfunction and cell death (5Sugars K.L. Rubinsztein D.C. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 133-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 11Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Here, we found transcriptional deregulation of NFκB in the expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cells, which might be due to the UPS dysfunction as well as sequestration of various components of NFκB complex and could be a common feature among all polyglutamine diseases. Finally, we have also shown that some of the NFκB-regulated genes, such as Cox2 and iNOS, are down-regulated in the expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cells. What could be the consequence of the down-regulation of NFκB activity in the expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cells? NFκB activation has been reported to protect as well as to promote cell death, depending on the cell type and/or inducing signal (22Mattson M.P. Camandola S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 24Sullivan P.G. Bruce-Keller A.J. Rabchevsky A.G. Christakos S. Clair D.K. Mattson M.P. Scheff S.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6248-6256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But in most cases, its activation leads to the protection of cell death, particularly in the neuronal cells (22Mattson M.P. Camandola S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). NFκB activity was reported to be increased in the striatal neurons of 3-nitropropionic acid-treated mice (an animal model for HD). However, the mice lacking the p50 subunit of NFκB show decreased activity and increased damage of striatal neurons (31Yu Z.F. Zhou D. Cheng G. Mattson M.P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This suggests that down-regulation of NFκB activity might lead to neurodegeneration. However, a recent paper shows activation of NFκB in the cellular and transgenic mice model of HD, and this activation leads to neurodegeneration (32Khoshnan A. Ko J. Watkin E.E. Paige L.A. Reinhart P.H. Patterson P.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7999-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We never detected an increase in NFκB activity in HD 150Q stable cells most likely because of a low level of expression and aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin without any induction. However, we have found a significant increase in NFκB activity at 24 h of post-transfection and a decrease in NFκB activity at 72 h of post-transfection of the polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-3. In both cases, we have observed direct correlation of decrease in NFκB activity and induction of cell death. It seems that expanded polyglutamine protein could possibly have a dual effect on NFκB, an initial phase of activation and a later stage of inhibition. Initially, the expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cells might be trying to protect themselves by activating NFκB, and later aggregates prevent the activation by promoting UPS dysfunction. Similarly, the amyloid β-peptide at low concentration has been found to activate NFκB that leads to neuroprotection, whereas at a higher concentration, it produces the opposite effect (29Kaltschmidt B. Uherek M. Wellmann H. Volk B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9409-9414Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We have observed down-regulation of NFκB activity promoting expanded polyglutamine protein-induced cell death, which suggests that inhibition of NFκB activity might be responsible for the expanded polyglutamine protein-induced cell death. Further work is necessary to confirm this. Altogether, our results demonstrate the down-regulation of NFκB activity in the expanded polyglutamine protein-expressing cell, and this inhibition of NFκB activity might be linked with the expanded polyglutamine protein-induced cell death.

Here, we report that the uncharacterized open reading frame YOR166c genetically interacts with TREX complex components and encodes a novel protein named Swt1 for “synthetically lethal with TREX.” Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that Swt1 also interacts with the TREX complex biochemically. Consistent with a potential role in transcription as suggested by its interaction with TREX, Swt1 localizes mainly to the nucleus. Importantly, deletion of Swt1 leads to decreased transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that Swt1 functions in gene expression in conjunction with the TREX complex. The conserved TREX complex couples transcription to nuclear mRNA export.

Taken together, these data suggest that Swt1 functions in gene expression in conjunction with the TREX complex. Gene expression in eukaryotes is a multistep process including transcription initiation, elongation, and termination, processing of the mRNA and its packaging into a mature mRNP, and finally export of the mRNP to the cytoplasm, where it is translated by the ribosomes. Interestingly, recent work uncovered that different steps in mRNA biogenesis are intimately linked (1Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 3Zorio D.A. Bentley D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).One of the key players coupling two of these processes is the conserved TREX complex, which functions at the interface between transcription elongation and mRNA export (4Reed R. Cheng H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 319-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). TREX consists of the heterotetrameric THO complex, which has a function in transcription elongation, the mRNA export factors Sub2 and Yra1, the two SR proteins Gbp2 and Hrb1, and the conserved Tex1 (6Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). According to our current model, THO is present on the transcribed gene and recruits the two mRNA export factors Sub2 and Yra1 to the nascent mRNA during transcription elongation (6Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 7Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Sub2 and Yra1, most likely together with other factors that package the mRNA into an mRNP such as the SR protein Npl3, take over the mRNA (8Jensen T.H. Boulay J. Rosbash M. Libri D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1711-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Yra1 in turn interacts directly with the essential and conserved Mex67-Mtr2 complex (10Strasser K. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 410-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Strahm Y. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4219-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This mRNA exporter mediates the export of the mRNP through the nuclear pore complex by direct interactions with the mRNP and nuclear pore proteins (12Strasser K. Bassler J. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Importantly, most proteins described above for Saccharomyces cerevisiae are conserved in evolution and an equivalent function has been shown in higher eukaryotes.In addition to an impairment in transcription elongation, mutants of the THO complex show a transcription-dependent hyperrecombination phenotype (13Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 14Jimeno S. Rondon A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This combined phenotype of transcription impairment and hyperrecombination is most likely caused by the accumulation of DNA-RNA hybrids during transcription, which is consistent with the hypothesis that THO functions in transcription elongation through cotranscriptional mRNP formation (6Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 7Zenklusen D.

Cell. 2003; 12: 711-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Consistently, mutations in mRNA export factors such as SUB2, YRA1, MEX67, and MTR2 also lead to a similar transcription-impairment and hyperrecombination phenotype as mutation of THO (14Jimeno S. Rondon A.G. Luna R. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3526-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the TREX complex is genetically linked to Rrp6, the nucleus-specific component of the exosome (7Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 16Libri D. Dower K. Boulay J. Thomsen R. Rosbash M. Jensen T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8254-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition to Rrp6, the nuclear exosome contains several 3′-5′-exoribonucleases and is involved in processing of small nuclear and nucleolar RNAs, rRNAs, and pre-rRNA spacers (17Butler J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 90-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that the exosome plays a role in nuclear degradation of mRNAs of mutants with defects in 3′-end formation and/or polyadenylation (7Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Wyss J.C. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 16Libri D. Dower K. Boulay J. Thomsen R. Rosbash M. Jensen T.H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2005; 25: 9996-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these mRNAs are retained at the site of transcription and Rrp6 is needed for this retention (19Jensen T.H. Patricio K. McCarthy T. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, it was proposed that the exoribonuclease Rrp6 functions in the quality control of mRNP formation by retention of incorrectly processed mRNAs and their degradation (Ref. 20Jensen T.H. Dower K. Libri D. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1129-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar and references therein).Here, we describe for the first time a function for the novel protein Swt1 in a transcription associated process. The open reading frame (ORF) 3The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; sl, synthetic lethal; FOA, 5-fluorotic acid; HA, haemagglutinin; TAP, tandem affinity purification. 3The abbreviations used are: ORF, open reading frame; sl, synthetic lethal; FOA, 5-fluorotic acid; HA, haemagglutinin; TAP, tandem affinity purification. YOR166c encoding this novel protein becomes essential in yeast strains that are compromised in TREX function and was thus named SWT1 (for synthetic lethal with TREX). In addition to this genetic relationship, Swt1 interacts biochemically with the TREX complex and RNA polymerase II. Even though Swt1 is not essential for cell viability, deletion of SWT1 leads to a decrease in transcription. Taken together, we propose that Swt1 is needed in conjunction with the TREX complex for efficient gene expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Plasmids—Strains RS453, JBa, JBα, Δtho2, Δhpr1, Δmft1, Δthp2, SUB2 shuffle, and plasmids pHT4467Δ, pRS315-THO2, pUN100-HPR1, pRS315-MFT1, pRS315-THP2, pRS315-SUB2, pRS315-sub2–85, and pNOPPATA1L were described previously. Strains spt5–194 and spt5–242 were a gift of Dr. Grant Hartzog. The synthetic lethal (sl) screening strain Δhpr1 ade2 ade3 was generated by mating Δhpr1 to Jbα, sporulation of diploids, and tetrad analysis. The sl screening strain Δyor166c ade2 ade3 was generated likewise after mating of Δyor166c to JBa. The strain YOR166c/Δyor166c (W303 background) was obtained from Euroscarf and sporulated to obtain haploid YOR166c disrupted cells. Strains Δdst1 and Δrtf1 were obtained from Euroscarf. Strains HPR1 Δyor166c, MFT1 Δyor166c, THP2 Δyor166c, and SUB2 Δyor166c were generated by mating the respective knock-out strain containing a pRS316-based wild-type gene with Δyor166c, sporulation of diploid cells, and selection of double disrupted strains carrying a pRS316-based wild-type copy of either HPR1, MFT1, THP2, or SUB2 after tetrad analysis. Strains Δtho2 YOR166c, Δdst1 YOR166c, Δrtf1 YOR166c, spt5–194 YOR166c, and spt5–242 YOR166c were obtained by mating the Δtho2, Δdst1, Δrtf1, spt5–194, or spt5–242 strains, respectively, with strain Δyor166c carrying pRS316-YOR166c, sporulation, and tetrad analysis. Strain SWT1-TAP was generated by integration of a TAP-tag C-terminal of the SWT1 gene with a TRP1 marker according to (21Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods (San Diego. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). The GAL1::TAP-SWT1 strain was made by integration of an N-terminal GAL1-driven TAP-tag with a TRP1 marker, and TAP-SWT1 was derived from GAL1:: TAP1-SWT1 through recombination with Cre recombinase according to Puig et al. (21Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods (San Diego. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). To obtain the strain GAL1::TAP-SWT1 HPR1-HA, an HA-tag was integrated with the HIS3 marker C-terminal of HPR1 according to (22Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4110) Google Scholar). Strains TAP-SWT1 HPR1 and SWT1-TAP HPR1 were obtained by mating the N- or C-terminally TAP-tagged SWT1 strains with Δhpr1 carrying pRS316-HPR1.Sl screening plasmids pHT4467Δ-HPR1 and pHT4467Δ-YOR166c were cloned by inserting the coding region of HPR1 and YOR166c, respectively, including 5′ and 3′ sequences into pHT4467Δ. Plasmid pUN100–267 was recovered from FOA-resistant sl Δhpr1 267, transformed with a pUN100 genomic library to clone the complementing gene, and contains the YOR166c ORF. Plasmid pRS315-YOR166c was constructed by amplifying the YOR166c coding region plus about 300 bp 5′ and 800 bp 3′ creating XhoI and PstI sites and cloning into the same sites of pRS315. pRS314-YOR166c and pRS316-YOR166c were generated by subcloning the XhoI-PstI or XhoI-BamHI fragment of pRS315-YOR166c into the same sites of pRS314 and pRS316, respectively. pNOPPATA1L-SWT1, -SWT1-N+M, -SWT1-M, -SWT1-M+C, and SWT1-N+C were cloned by amplification of the whole ORF of SWT1 or the sequence coding for the domains (N+M, bp 1–900; M, bp 379–900; M+C, bp 379–1374; N+C, bp 1–378 fused to bp 901–1374) creating NcoI and BamHI sites and cloned into the same sites of pNOPPATA1L. Plasmids pRS315-DST1, pRS315-RTF1, and pRS315-SPT5 were constructed by amplifying the respective ORF plus about 500 bp 5′ and 300 bp 3′ creating XhoI and BamHI sites and cloning into the same sites of pRS315. pRS313lacZ was a gift of Karin Breunig.Synthetic Lethal Screens and Defined Synthetic Lethal Interactions—The sl screens with deletion alleles of Δhpr1 and Δyor166c were performed as described (10Strasser K. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 410-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test sl interactions in a defined manner double deletion strains of YOR166c/SWT1 and the gene to be tested (geneX), which were covered by one of the genes on a URA3-plasmid (pRS316), were generated. Each strain was transformed with plasmid-encoded YOR166c/SWT1, geneX, an empty vector, or a plasmid encoding a mutant allele of geneX (in case of SUB2). Transformants were restreaked onto FOA-containing plates to shuffle out the URA3-plasmid. No growth indicates a synthetic lethal relationship between the tested alleles.Functionality of Swt1 Domains and TAP-tagged Swt1—To test the functionality of domains of SWT1 plasmids expressing combinations of the domains (N+M, M, M+C, and N+C) under the control of the NOP1 promoter were transformed into different sl strains isolated in the sl screens, which depend on the expression of a functional SWT1 gene for growth and are covered by a SWT1, HPR1, or THO2 gene on a URA3-plasmid. Transformants were restreaked onto FOA-containing plates to shuffle out the URA3-plasmid. Growth indicates a rescue of the synthetic lethal phenotype and thus functionality of the SWT1 domain construct.Since cell growth is dependent on a functional Swt1 in a Δhpr1 background, strains with a genomically N- or C-terminally TAP-tagged SWT1 were mated to a Δhpr1 strain carrying HPR1 on a URA3-plasmid and double mutants selected by tetrad analysis. Growth on FOA depends on functionality of the tagged SWT1 gene.Localization of Swt1 by Cell Fractionation—Protein extracts from a TAP-SWT1 strain in a Ficoll-containing buffer were separated into homogenate, post-nuclear supernatant, and nuclear pellet. The nuclear pellet was resuspended and separated on a sucrose density step gradient according to (23Hurt E.C. McDowall A. Schimmang T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 554-563PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using antibodies against protA (PAP, Sigma), HA (Roche Applied Science), Yra1 (9Strasser K. Hurt E. Nature. 2001; 413: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), Rpb1 (8WG16, Covance), nucleoporins (Mab414, Covance), Tim50 (24Mokranjac D. Paschen S.A. Kozany C. Prokisch H. Hoppins S.C.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase Pgk1 (Molecular Probes).Purification of TAP-Swt1—Swt1 and associated proteins were purified by the TAP method (21Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods (San Diego. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Copurifying proteins were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using antibodies directed against HA (Roche Applied Science), Sub2 (6Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J.

A. 1996; 93: 13641-13646Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the CTD of Rpb1 (8WG16, Covance).Analysis of Recombination Frequency—Wild-type (W303), Δswt1, and Δhpr1 strains were transformed with plasmid pRS314-LYΔNS (26Chavez S. Beilharz T. Rondon A.G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Lithgow T. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5824-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and grown for 3 days at 30 and 37 °C, respectively. Nine independent transformants each were resuspended in H2O and plated on SDC(-Trp) and SDC(-Leu) plates, colonies counted after 3 days of growth, and the frequency of recombination calculated as Leu+ recombinants over viable cells.β-Galactosidase Expression—Cells were grown in synthetic medium containing 2% raffinose before either 2% galactose or 2% glucose were added. Cells were harvested after 8 h of logarithmic growth, washed twice with Z-buffer, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed in Z-buffer by three freeze and thaw cycles, and the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl galactopyranoside was assayed as described (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was calculated from six independent experiments and glucose values were substracted from the galactose values.Northern Blot—RNA was isolated from cells grown in raffinose or shifted to 2% galactose for 1 h by phenol extraction. RNA was separated by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis following standard procedures (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar). For each sample 10 μg of RNA were loaded, transferred to positive TM membranes (MP biomedicals), and visualized by methylene blue. Membranes were hybridized to [32P]dCTP-labeled probes specific for lacZ or GAL1, which were randomly labeled (Stratagene Prime-It II) and purified (Bio-Rad Micro Bio-Spin 30). For the loading control the plasmid pG3T726SSH containing the 25S rDNA was used. The membrane was exposed to a storage phosphor screen and analyzed using a Storm imaging system (Molecular Dynamics).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe Uncharacterized YOR166c Interacts Genetically with TREX Components—To identify novel components that play a role in transcription elongation and/or mRNA export, we performed an sl screen with a deletion allele of HPR1, a gene encoding one of the four proteins of the THO complex. One of the sl candidates identified in this screen, sl Δhpr1 267, was complemented by a library plasmid (see Fig. 1A; +267) that contains seven full-length ORFs. Subcloning of individual genes showed that the uncharacterized gene YOR166c complements the sl candidate Δhpr1 267 (see Fig. 1A; +YOR166c). In addition, the coding region of Yor166c under control of the constitutive NOP1 promoter rescued the sl phenotype of sl Δhpr1 267 (see Fig. 1A; +NOP1::YOR166c). Thus, YOR166c interacts genetically with HPR1.YOR166c is an uncharacterized, non-essential gene, knock-out of which leads to a temperature sensitive phenotype on minimal medium (see Fig. 5A). As a first attempt to characterize YOR166c we performed an sl screen with a deletion allele of YOR166c to identify genetic interactors of YOR166c and thus the context of its function. All seven sl candidates isolated in this screen were complemented by either THO2 or HPR1 (see Fig. 1B for one example each). This underlined the genetic interaction of YOR166c with HPR1 and showed that YOR166c also interacts genetically with another component of the THO complex, THO2, but unfortunately did not reveal any additional genetic interactors of YOR166c.FIGURE 5Swt1 is necessary for efficient transcription. A, deletion of SWT1 causes a slow growth phenotype on synthetic medium at 37 °C. 10-Fold dilutions of Δswt1 cells carrying a plasmid encoding SWT1 (pRS315-SWT1) or an empty plasmid (pRS315) were spotted onto plates containing full medium (YPD) or synthetic medium (SDC) and incubated at the indicated temperatures for 2 or 3 days, respectively. B, scheme of the LEU2-based direct repeat reporter system. Recombination between the repeats leads to a functional LEU2 gene. C, loss of Swt1 does not cause hyperrecombination. The frequency of recombination of a Δswt1 strain is similar to a wild-type strain at 30 and 37 °C. As positive control the recombination frequency of a Δhpr1 strain is shown (gray, right axis). D, deletion of SWT1 causes a decrease inβ-galactosidase expression. Wild-type, Δswt1, and Δhpr1 cells carrying a plasmid encoding lacZ under control of the GAL1 promoter were grown at 30 and 37 °C (only wild-type and Δswt1) and β-galactosidase activity was measured. E, RNA levels of lacZ and GAL1 mRNA are lower in Δswt1 cells. Cells were grown as above, total RNA extracted, and Northern blots probed for lacZ, GAL1, and 25 S rRNA transcripts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess in a defined manner the genetic interaction between YOR166c and THO2 or HPR1 and to test the likely assumption that YOR166c also interacts with the other two components of the THO complex, MFT1 and THP2, double knock-out strains of YOR166c and one of the four THO components were generated. Fig. 1C shows that deletion of YOR166c is synthetically lethal with a deletion of each of the four genes encoding a member of the THO complex. Thus, YOR166c interacts genetically with all four THO components. To test whether the genetic interaction of YOR166c with the THO complex also extents to the other members of the TREX complex, we tested whether YOR166c shows a synthetic lethal phenotype with alleles of SUB2 and YRA1. Deletion of YOR166c is sl with the temperature sensitive allele of SUB2, sub2–85 (Fig. 1D). However, we could not detect any sl relationship between YOR166c and various alleles of YRA1 or MEX67 (data not shown). Based on its synthetic lethality with TREX components, we named the gene YOR166c SWT1 for sl with TREX. As implicated by its genetic interactions, Swt1 might play a role in transcription elongation and early steps of mRNA export and/or transcription-dependent recombination.SWT1 Does Not Show a Synthetic Lethal Interaction with Diverse Components of the Transcription Elongation Machinery—As shown above SWT1 shows a genetic interaction with genes encoding components of the TREX complex, especially THO. To test whether this interaction is specific for the function of TREX or extends to other factors implicated in transcription elongation, we tested a possible sl relationship of SWT1 with DST1, RTF1, or SPT5. DST1 encodes yeast TFIIS, which is necessary for efficient transcription elongation as it cleaves the nascent mRNA on backtracked RNA polymerase II so the polymerase can resume RNA synthesis (Refs. 29Fish R.N.

Spt5 and Spt4 form a complex that is homologous to metazoan DSIF, a transcription elongation factor, which first acts negatively in its unphosphorylated form but also has a positive function in transcription elongation (Ref. 33Sims R.J. II I Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar and references therein). As DST1 and RTF1 are non-essential genes, we used deletion alleles to test synthetic lethality with SWT1, whereas a ts and a cs allele of the essential SPT5 gene was used. SWT1 is not essential in a genetic background lacking DST1 or RTF1 or containing mutant alleles of SPT5 (data not shown). Although one cannot exclude that SWT1 interacts genetically with other alleles of DST1, RTF1, and SPT5 than the tested ones or with genes encoding other transcription elongation factors, the lack of genetic interactions with these three transcription elongation factors suggests that the genetic interaction between SWT1 and components of TREX is rather specific. This indicates that the function of Swt1 is closely related to TREX.Domain Analysis of Swt1—Swt1 is a 458-amino acid protein that can be subdivided into an N-terminal domain, a middle domain, and a C-terminal domain according to its amino acid sequence and secondary structure predictions (see Fig. 2A). Whereas the N- and the C-terminal domain do not share any significant sequence homology to other known proteins or domains, the middle domain contains a PINc domain (Fig. 2B). PINc domains are a large family of predicted nucleotide-binding domains. Proteins containing such a domain are expected to be RNases based on their similarities to 5′-exonucleases (34Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R888-R890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35Arcus V.L. Backbro K. Roos A. Daniel E.L. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16471-16478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, seven proteins are classified as PINc proteins in the SMART data base. Fig. 2C shows a sequence alignment of the PINc domains of these seven PINc-containing proteins; three of them have been characterized: Nmd4 is involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, Rrp44 is a component of the exosome, and Nob1 is suggested to cleave the 20 S pre-rRNA in the cytoplasm as a component of the 43 S preribosomes. Recently, the remaining four uncharacterized PINc proteins including YOR166c/SWT1 were analyzed for a function in pre-18 S rRNA cleavage (36Bleichert F. Granneman S. Osheim Y.N. Beyer A.L. Baserga S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9464-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, deletion of YOR166c did not effect ribosome biogenesis.FIGURE 2Functional analysis of Swt1 domains. A, domain organization of Swt1. Numbers on top indicate amino acids of Swt1. The dark gray domain is a region of low complexity. B, schematic of the PINc domain with conserved active site residues shown in black and lower conserved residues shown in dark gray (indicated by a black or gray star, respectively). C, multiple sequence alignment of all PINc domain-containing proteins of S. cerevisiae. Sequences were aligned using ClustalW 1.8 and Boxshade and modified manually. Conserved active site residues are indicated with a black star and lower conserved residues with a gray star. D–F, three different candidates isolated in the sl screens with Δhpr1 and Δswt1, which depend on the presence of a functional SWT1 gene for growth, were transformed with constructs expressing combinations of Swt1 domains under the constitutive NOP1 promoter. A combination of two Swt1 domains gives a functional protein. Transformants were restreaked onto FOA-containing plates and incubated for 5 days at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess which domains of Swt1 are essential for its function, domain deletion mutants were expressed under control of the constituous NOP1 promoter. As deletion of SWT1 does not lead to a severe growth phenotype (see Fig. 5A), the functionality of these constructs was tested in the isolated sl strains (shown in Fig. 1), which depend on a functional Swt1 for viability. As expected these sl strains grow when transformed with a plasmid expressing Hpr1 or Tho2, respectively, or full-length Swt1 under control of the NOP1 promoter (positive controls), whereas these strains cannot grow when they contain a plasmid not coding for any of these genes (+empty/negative control, Fig. 2, D–F). Growth of cells and thus functionality of Swt1 is also conferred by deletion mutants of Swt1 containing either the N and M domain (+N+M) or the M and C domain (+M+C; see Fig. 2, B–D). In contrast, any single domain is not functional (see Fig. 2, D–F; +M; for N and C domain alone; data now shown). Interestingly, fusion of the N domain to the C domain (+N+C), i.e. deletion of the M domain, leads to a functional protein, indicating that the PINc (= M) domain is not necessary for Swt1 function. This finding is surprising but consistent with our finding that heterologously expressed Swt1 does not show any detectable RNA binding or RNase activity in vitro. 4A. Kieser, unpublished results. In addition, deletion of SWT1 is not sl with deletion of RRP6 (data not shown), the nuclear component of the exosome known to be needed for rRNA processing and degradation of aberrant mRNPs (19Jensen T.H. Patricio K. McCarthy T. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, Swt1 could need a binding partner that we have not identified so far to be catalytically active. Also, it has not yet been possible to demonstrate a nuclease activity of a eukaryotic PINc domain protein in vitro. Interestingly, a potential nuclease activity of Swt1 could be needed e.g. for the degradation of aberrant mRNPs. Taken together a combination of two of the three domains of Swt1 is functional suggesting a redundant function of the domains of Swt1.Swt1 Is Mainly Localized to the Nucleus—We wanted to determine the cellular localization of Swt1. To do this Swt1 was genomically tagged N- as well as C-terminally with the TAP tag. To assess whether these fusion proteins are functional, the TAP-SWT1 and SWT1-"
