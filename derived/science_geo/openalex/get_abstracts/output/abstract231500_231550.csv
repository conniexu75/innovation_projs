https://openalex.org/W2016160962,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in many aspects of oxygen homeostasis. The heterodimeric HIF complex is regulated by proteolysis of its α-subunits, following oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of specific prolyl residues. Although three HIF prolyl hydroxylases, PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3, have been identified that have the potential to catalyze this reaction, the contribution of each isoform to the physiological regulation of HIF remains uncertain. Here we show using suppression by small interference RNA that each of the three PHD isoforms contributes in a non-redundant manner to the regulation of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α subunits and that the contribution of each PHD under particular culture conditions is strongly dependent on the abundance of the enzyme. Thus in different cell types, isoform-specific patterns of PHD induction by hypoxia and estrogen alter both the relative abundance of the PHDs and their relative contribution to the regulation of HIF. In addition, the PHDs manifest specificity for different prolyl hydroxylation sites within each HIF-α subunit, and a degree of selectively between HIF-1α and HIF-2α isoforms, indicating that differential PHD inhibition has the potential to selectively alter the characteristics of HIF activation.

The response of cells to hypoxia is characterized by specific alterations in the expression of a large number of genes, many of which are regulated directly or indirectly by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase domain; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HREs, hypoxia response elements; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ODD, oxygen-dependent degradation domain; NODD, N-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain; CODD, C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain; VP16, transactivation domain from the herpes simplex virus protein 16 (amino acids 410–490); Gal, the N-terminal 147 amino acids of the yeast transcription factor Gal4; IVTT, in vitro transcription and translation; CA-IX, carbonic anhydrase IX; mAb, monoclonal antibody. a transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in many aspects of oxygen homeostasis (1Bruick R.K.

Thus the characterization of these HIF hydroxylases provides an important focus for analyses of cellular responses to hypoxia.

Initial analysis has established that all have the ability to hydroxylate HIF-α polypeptides in vitro (11Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L.

However, the precise function of each PHD isoform in vivo and indeed whether HIF is the physiological substrate of all three enzymes, are important unanswered questions. Using siRNA techniques, Berra and colleagues (23Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar) have shown a dominant role for PHD2 in controlling the levels of HIF-1α in normoxia in a range of cell types. Little or no effect was observed with siRNAs for PHD1 and PHD3, raising questions as to the function of these enzymes. However, given the absence of precise knowledge of protein abundance, it is unclear whether such results reflect variation in the efficacy of the siRNA interventions at the protein level, dominant expression of PHD2 in the cells analyzed, or a greater specificity of PHD2 action on HIF-1α. Because enzymes of this type are non-equilibrium enzymes, i.e. they do not catalyze the reverse reaction, it would be predicted that enzyme abundance will be an important determinant of the rate of substrate hydroxylation and hence, potentially, an important determinant of any role played in the regulation of HIF. Analysis of mRNA expression for the PHDs has suggested the existence of tissue-specific expression patterns (16Hirsila M. Koivunen P. Gunzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol.

Given the central role of the HIF system in cellular physiology, and in ischemic and neoplastic disease, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of the expression and function of the PHD proteins and have examined the effects of siRNA-mediated suppression of individual isoforms in a wide range of cells and culture conditions. We show that there is substantial variation in the expression of the PHD isoforms in different cells but that all three enzymes contribute to the regulation of HIF, with the effects of siRNA-mediated suppression of individual enzymes being influenced strongly by the level of expressed PHD protein. Differential induction and cell type-specific PHD expression patterns are shown to alter the relative importance of PHD isoforms in setting levels of HIF-α proteins under different conditions. Furthermore, the actions of the PHDs on different HIF-α isoforms were not equivalent, with PHD2 having relatively more influence on HIF-1α than HIF-2α and PHD3 having relatively more influence on HIF-2α than HIF-1α. Our findings thus establish a role for all of the PHD isoforms in the regulation of HIF but show differential effects that have the potential to shape the physiological characteristics of the system. Cell Culture—The human cell lines studied were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin except for BT-474, OVCAR-3, 833K, and SuSa, which were cultured in RPMI 1640 and A549 in Ham's F-12, both with identical supplements. Hypoxic conditions were achieved in an Invivo2 400 hypoxic workstation (Ruskin Technologies). RNase Protection Assays—Total RNA was extracted in RNAzol B (Biogenesis, Bournemouth, UK) and dissolved in hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, 400 mm sodium chloride, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8)). 45 μg of total RNA was assayed with U6 small nuclear RNA serving as an internal control as previously described (30Gleadle J.M. Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1362-C1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PHD riboprobe templates have been described previously (12Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M.

Antibody Production and Characterization—To generate PHD antibodies, immunogens were produced as follows. Full-length human PHD1 cDNA was ligated into pMAL-p2X, expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified using amylase resin. An NcoI/NotI restriction fragment of human PHD2 cDNA was cloned in-frame into a modified pGEX plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) to express amino acids 1–124 of PHD2. A SacII/DrdI fragment of human PHD3 was cloned similarly to express amino acids 1–100 of PHD3. The protein expression of PHD2 and PHD3 glutathione S-transferase fusions in BL21(DE3) cells was high but predominantly insoluble. The proteins were partially purified by solubilization in 2–8 m 1% Triton X-100/5 mm dithiothreitol/PBS/pH 7.5 and dialysis against 1% Triton X-100/PBS. Both fusion proteins precipitated after dialysis and were suspended in Triton/PBS for mouse immunization. To create an anti-PHD1 polyclonal antibody, two rabbits were immunized with 200 μg of protein in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (Difco, Detroit, MI), followed by four boosts at 4-week intervals with 100 μg of protein in Incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Test bleeds were examined by immunoblot analysis of COS7 cell extract transfected with pcDNA3 PHD1. The PHD1 antiserum was affinity-purified by Harlan Sera-Lab (Loughborough, UK) to generate polyclonal antibody P1-1.1af. Balb/c mice were immunized with 50 μg of protein of each PHD immunogen in Complete Freund's adjuvant followed by three further immunizations of 50 μg of protein in PBS at 10-day intervals. Fusion of mouse splenocytes with myeloma cells was performed using standard techniques. Hybridoma supernatants were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays against the fusion proteins and fusion tags alone and immunolabeling of COS7 cells, which were transfected with corresponding PHD plasmids. Positive clones were confirmed by immunoblot analysis of COS7 cell extracts of PHD transfectants and are designated mAb P1-112, mAb P2-76a, and mAb P3-188e. The specificity and relative affinity of the PHD antibodies was examined by immunoblot analysis of equimolar quantities of PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3 proteins. Radiolabeled proteins were produced by IVTT (Promega) utilizing [35S]methionine and plasmids encoding the cDNA for each protein (pcDNA3 PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3). The amount of each programmed lysate, which contained equimolar amounts of PHD protein, was calculated on the basis of their 35S signal intensities adjusted according to the number of labeled methionine residues. Equimolar amounts of IVTT-generated protein were then run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the PHD antibodies. To determine protein abundance by immunoblotting, subconfluent cells were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently lysed in urea/SDS buffer (6.7 m urea, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1% SDS) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration was determined using a Detergent Compatible Protein Assay kit (DC™ assay; Bio-Rad), and extracts were normalized for protein content. Whole cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). In addition to the PHD antibodies, membranes were probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies against HIF-1α (clone-54, H72320, BD Transduction Laboratories), HIF-2α (clone-190b (31Wiesener M.S.

Virology. 1992; 187: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar)), and BNIP3 (ANa40; Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (DAKO) were used with the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences) to visualize immunoreactive bands. siRNA Preparation—To screen for effective siRNAs, candidate siRNA sequences for each PHD enzyme were selected based upon criteria in Refs. 33Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tusche T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar and 34Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar and prepared by in vitro transcription using the Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion). Effective siRNA sequences were subsequently chemically synthesized with two deoxythymidine nucleotide 3 overhang and PAGE-purified (Ambion). siRNA strands were annealed in a buffer consisting of 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm magnesium acetate by heating to 90 °C for 1 min, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. The two siRNAs targeting PHD1 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_053046) correspond to nucleotides 835–855 and 1471–1489; those to PHD2 (GenBank™ accession number NM_022051) correspond to nucleotides 3901–3921 and 4077–4097; and those to PHD3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_022073) target nucleotides 671–691 and 715–735. Control siRNAs were the Silencer™ negative control siRNA (Ambion), a sequence provided by the manufacturers that has no significant homology to any mammalian gene, and a previously described siRNA (23Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar) that targets nucleotides 2558–2578 of the D. melanogaster HIF-1α homolog, Sima (GenBank™ accession number U43090). siRNA Transfections—Cells were seeded at 30% confluence in antibiotic-free medium 24 h prior to transfection. Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect cells with 20 nm siRNA duplex twice at 24-h intervals unless otherwise stated. The efficacy of the siRNA transfection in each experiment was ascertained by immunoblotting. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—MCF7 cells were seeded in 12-well dishes at 1.5 × 105 cells per dish and incubated overnight. The cells were then co-transfected using Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) with plasmids expressing a Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter (pUAS.tk.Luc, 0.4 μg), β-galactosidase (pCMVβGal, 0.12 μg), Gal4/HIF/VP16 fusions (35O'Rourke J.F.

The HIF-α domains encoded by the Gal4/HIF/VP16 plasmids were as follows: pGal/HIF-1αNODD/VP16 (amino acids 344–553), pGal/HIF-1αCODD/VP16 (amino acids 554–698), pGal/HIF-2αNODD/VP16 (amino acids 345–517), and pGal/HIF-2αCODD/VP16 (amino acids 517–682). Gal4/HIF/VP16 plasmid doses were in the range 1–4 ng, based on preliminary titration experiments that aimed to generate approximately similar luciferase activities in cells not co-transfected with PHD expression plasmids (see Fig. 8, A and B, control). The dose of transfected plasmid encoding the PHD enzymes was adjusted in the range 2–10 ng in preliminary experiments so as to achieve approximately equimolar concentrations of the three enzymes in the cell lysates (see Fig. 8C). Transfections were performed in triplicate. After 24 h, cell extracts were prepared in passive lysate buffer (Promega) and analyzed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activities as previously described (35O'Rourke J.F. Tian Y.-M.

The same cell extracts were used to examine expression levels of the PHD proteins by immunoblotting. PHD Isoforms Manifest Distinct Patterns of Cellular Expression—To guide the functional analysis of PHD proteins in the regulation of HIF, we first undertook a detailed study of PHD expression in a range of cell lines.

Fig. 1 shows results for cells derived from a variety of human tissues: BxPC-3 (pancreatic carcinoma); PC-3 (prostate carcinoma); MCF7, HS-587T, MDA-435, T47D, and ZR-75–1 (breast carcinoma); U-2 OS (osteosarcoma); OVCAR-3 (ovarian carcinoma); A549 (lung carcinoma); HT1080 (rhabdomyosarcoma); and JAR (choriocarcinoma). Major variations in expression were observed both across the panel of cells and even within those derived from a single (breast carcinoma) tumor type (Fig. 1). In normoxic cells both PHD1 mRNA and PHD2 mRNA were widely expressed but at varying levels; expression of PHD3 mRNA was also variable and in normoxia was often at, or below, the detection threshold for these assays. Individual PHD isoforms, however, showed generally consistent patterns of regulation by hypoxia. Whereas levels of PHD1 mRNA were unchanged or significantly decreased by hypoxia (ZR-75–1, OVCAR-3, and JAR), levels of PHD2 and PHD3 were increased by hypoxia, induction being particularly striking for PHD3 mRNA. To define expression at the protein level we next produced a panel of specific antibodies. The antibodies detected the PHD proteins generated by IVTT or in cell extracts at a mobility consistent with their predicted molecular masses (PHD1, 43.6 kDa; PHD2, 46.0 kDa; and PHD3, 27.3 kDa) (Fig. 2A). Equimolar amounts of proteins radiolabeled with [35S]methionine were generated by IVTT in reticulocyte lysate, and saturating concentrations of antibody were used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of detection (Fig. 2A). This indicated that detection of PHD1 with polyclonal antibody P1-1.1af and PHD3 with mAb P3-188e had the highest (and essentially equivalent) sensitivity, whereas PHD2 was clearly detected with mAb P2-76a, but at lower sensitivity. No cross-reactivity was observed. Having established the relative sensitivity of the antibodies to equimolar amounts of IVTT-generated PHD proteins we used similarly generated proteins to calibrate immunoblots and estimate the relative abundance of PHD proteins in cell extracts (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2B shows representative immunoblots for PHD proteins in a range of cells. As was observed for the respective mRNAs, both PHD2 and PHD3 proteins were induced by hypoxia, with PHD3 induction being particularly striking in certain cells. Although these patterns of protein expression generally paralleled patterns of mRNA expression there were also important differences. In particular relative PHD1 protein levels were substantially lower than predicted by relative PHD1 mRNA levels and were barely detectable in many cell lines. As other work had highlighted the expression of PHD1 mRNA in breast carcinoma BT-474 cells (37Seth P. Krop I. Porter D. Polyak K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and in the testis (29Lieb M.E. Menzies K. Moschella M.C. Ni R. Taubman M.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we also examined BT-474 cells, and two other cell lines (833K and SuSa) of testicular origin (Fig. 2, B and C). PHD1 protein levels were again modest, but in the BT-474 and SuSa cell lines expression of PHD1 was somewhat higher than in the other lines examined. Overall, therefore, both PHD1 and PHD3 levels were relatively low across a wide range of normoxic cells so that PHD2 was clearly the most abundant enzyme in normoxic culture in all cells where detection thresholds permitted quantification. Even cells (e.g. A549 and HT1080) expressing relatively low levels of PHD2 mRNA showed substantial levels of PHD2 protein (data not shown). In hypoxia, the more striking induction of PHD3 than PHD2 altered these proportions substantially in some cells (e.g. BT-474 and MCF7) but not others (MDA-435, in which PHD3 remained undetectable). As with PHD1 mRNA, PHD1 protein was not induced by hypoxia. Interestingly, ho"

Despite the introduction of directly observed therapy, short course, in 1995, millions of tuberculosis patients continue to perish, and fully one-third of the world's population is infected with the causative agent of this disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. New drugs are urgently needed to shorten the duration of tuberculosis chemotherapy and treat the increasing number of infections with drug-resistant organisms. Target selection is critical to the development of new drugs but is hampered by a lack of understanding of the dynamics of the metabolic response to interruption of target function even by current agents. Predicting targets that would manifest a cidal activity, therefore, is limited by our incomplete understanding of the physiology of the bacilli and its ability to adapt to disruption of metabolism.An organism responds to changes in its environment by altering the level of expression of critical genes that transduce such signals into metabolic changes favoring continued growth and survival. Analysis of the transcriptional response by microarray can, in theory, provide clues to such adaptive responses, but thus far gene expression profiles have only been used to contrast the mechanisms of action of a small number of related drugs (1Agarwal A.K.

Coordinately regulated sets of genes (regulons) are often controlled by single transcriptional regulators that function as genetic master switches, committing the bacterium to a major alteration in metabolism. In M. tuberculosis, examples of such regulatory mechanisms have been reported recently from studies using genetic approaches, including the dormancy regulon (4Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger D. Visconti K.C. Harrell M.I. Dolganov G.M. Sherman D.R. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) and the stringent response (5Dahl J.L. Kraus C.N. Boshoff H.I. Doan B. Foley K. Avarbock D. Kaplan G. Mizrahi V. Rubin H. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10026-10031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The complexity of the cellular transcriptional response to drug-induced stress makes it very difficult to derive this sort of information solely from microarray analysis of a limited number of agents affecting the same metabolic pathway (6Huang P.

Kuhara S. Tashiro K. DNA Res. 2003; 10: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, by analyzing a wide variety of conditions, groups of genes have been identified that appear co-regulated under many different conditions in yeast (8Segal E. Shapira M. Regev A. Pe'er D. Botstein D. Koller D. Friedman N. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). In this study, we applied genome-wide expression profiling to diverse environmental changes, including many different drug types, to begin to map the adaptability of the bacilli to interruption of specific arms of metabolism. This allowed us to identify clusters of coordinately regulated genes both diagnostic for drug mechanism of action and useful for a more rational approach to the selection of critical drug targets.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESM. tuberculosis Growth Conditions, RNA Isolation, and Hybridization—M. tuberculosis (H37Rv, ATCC 27294) was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with albumin/dextrose/NaCl/glycerol/Tween 80, Dubos medium, or defined minimal medium as previously described (9Schnappinger D. Ehrt S. Voskuil M.I. Liu Y. Mangan J.A. Monahan I.M. Dolganov G. Efron B. Butcher P.D. Nathan C. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). Carbon sources were either 10 mm glucose, 10 mm succinate, or 0.05 mm sodium palmitate, and cultures were grown from an A650 of 0.005-0.3 before RNA isolation. Cultures grown under a self-depleted oxygen gradient (NRP-1) were set up as described (10Wayne L.G. Hayes L.G. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2062-2069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and RNA was isolated after 3-6 days. Nutrient starvation cultures were set up as previously described (5Dahl J.L. Kraus C.N. Boshoff H.I. Doan B. Foley K. Avarbock D. Kaplan G. Mizrahi V. Rubin H. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The organic extract of Eudistoma amplum was prepared as follows: the frozen, ground invertebrate was extracted with water at 4 °C, and the pellet was freeze-dried and then extracted at room temperature with methanol/methylene chloride (1:1). The solvent was evaporated and the extract dissolved in Me2SO to 9 mg/ml. S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) 1The abbreviations used are: GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; GC, gene cluster; TRC, triclosan; CPZ, chlorpromazine; TRZ, thioridazine; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone; DNP, dinitrophenol; CCO, cytochrome c oxidase; EMB, ethambutol. was used as a NO source. Cultures were grown from an A650 of 0.07-0.3 before adding either drug or solvent (1000-fold dilutions from Me2SO, ethanol, or water), and RNA was isolated at selected intervals thereafter (11Boshoff H.I. Reed M.B. Barry III, C.E. Mizrahi V. Cell. 2003; 113: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). For each drug-treated culture, a parallel culture was treated with an equivalent amount of vehicle (Me2SO, ethanol, or water) for the same amount of time. RNA from the latter culture was used as the reference sample to which the drug-treated sample was compared. Each treatment condition and each drug concentration was repeated a minimum of two independent times.M. tuberculosis carrying an integrated copy of the Mycobacterium smegmatis amidase pzaA, which hydrolyzes several aromatic amides (12Boshoff H.I. Mizrahi V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5479-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), was used for cultures treated with pyrazinamide, 5-chloropyrazinamide, nicotinamide, or benzamide. This strain was also used to investigate the transcriptional response during extracellular pH stress. Treatment was done in Middlebrook 7H9-based medium adjusted to the required pH (4.8, 5.2, or 5.6) with H3PO4 and referenced to cells grown in the same acidified medium without amide addition. Since pyrazinamide is only effective at low cell densities, cultures were grown to an A650 of 0.05 before treatment was initiated. MICs were measured using the microbroth dilution technique (13Lee R.E. Protopopova M. Crooks E. Slayden R.A. Terrot M. Barry III, C.E. J. Combinatorial Chem. 2003; 5: 172-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) using H37Rv or M. tuberculosis ΔmbtB (14De Voss J.J. Rutter K. Schroeder B.G. Su H. Zhu Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1252-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Iron preloading of cells was done for 3 h in 7H9-based medium containing a 10-fold excess of Fe3+. RNA labeling and hybridization was as previously described (11Boshoff H.I. Reed M.B. Barry III, C.E. Mizrahi V. Cell. 2003; 113: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar).Microarray Preparation and Data Analysis—Microarray preparation is described under GEO accession number GSE1642. Expression ratios were calculated as the feature pixel median minus background pixel median for one color channel divided by the same for the other channel. In cases where more than 10% of the feature pixels were saturated, the feature pixel mean was used instead of the median. When the feature pixel mean did not exceed the background pixel mean by more than two S.D. values (calculated from the background pixel distribution), the feature pixel median is used in the ratio without background subtraction. In cases where both color channels were near background (same criterion), the ratio value was set to “missing.” Expression ratios were transformed to the log base 2 for all further calculations.Standardized gene expression ratio patterns were calculated by subtracting the mean expression ratio and dividing by the S.D. statistics calculated from all ratios (all microarrays) for that gene. Standardizing in this way corrected for scale differences between the response patterns for different genes. The resulting z-scores were averaged according to the drug treatment name, resulting in a single value for each drug name for each gene (see Supplementary Data). These gene patterns where then clustered using a K-means algorithm (SAS Proc Fastclus) using the Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity metric. Two rounds of K-means clustering were conducted. The first with the subset of genes showing the highest treatment-dependent variation in expression as judged by one-way analysis of variance (SAS Proc ANOVA) on the original log ratio vectors, using treatment name as the class variable. The second round used all genes, but without allowing the cluster number to increase or the cluster centroids to drift (assigning the remaining genes to the existing clusters formed in the first round of clustering). We arrived at the Fastclus “maxclusters” parameter, the maximum number of clusters to define, value of 150 clusters, by multiplying the number of class levels (treatments), 75, by 2. The number of genes selected for the first round of clustering (1650) was limited to 11 times the number of clusters and were those with the most statistically significant one-way analysis of variance score. A single pattern of response for each gene cluster was calculated as the mean of all standardized gene patterns assigned to the cluster by Proc Fastclus. These cluster centroids were themselves clustered using average linkage algorithm calculated in Microsoft Excel VBA using a one minus the Pearson correlation coefficient for the distance metric (15Kaufman L. Rousseeuw P.J. Finding Groups in Data: An Introduction to Cluster Analysis. 9th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar) to arrive at the ordering of rows in Fig. 3 (for details, see Supplementary Data). Patterns of response to each treatment were clustered using the same method to arrive at the column order in Fig. 3. The array data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus at NCBI (GEO; available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) with GEO accession number GSE1642.Real Time, Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Assay—The expression of iniB, Rv3161, kasA, efpA, fadE23, rplJ, rplN, dnaE2, radA, mbtB, csd, narH, narG, cydA, and ald was quantitated after normalization of RNA levels to the expression of the sigA gene as previously described (11Boshoff H.I. Reed M.B. Barry III, C.E. Mizrahi V. Cell. 2003; 113: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and results are available in Supplementary Data.Enzyme Assays—Enzyme assays were done on proteins from M. smegmatis. Purification and determination of NADH dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase activities was performed as previously described (16Miesel L. Weisbrod T.R. Marcinkeviciene J.A. Bittman R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Oxygen Consumption Assays—The effect of drugs on oxygen consumption by M. tuberculosis was done in parafilm-sealed, glass screw-cap tubes that were filled with midlog phase culture containing 0.001% methylene blue. Decolorization typically occurred after 12 h. The rate of oxygen consumption was measured in M. smegmatis using midlog stage cultures treated with drug for 1 h before adding 0.01% methylene blue and monitoring decolorization at 665 nm.Sugar Analysis—Cell walls were prepared, and glycosyl compositions were determined by the alditol acetate methods as described (17Deng L. Mikusova K. Robuck K.G. Scherman M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).NADH/NAD+ Determination—NADH and NAD+ levels were determined by a sensitive cycling assay (18San K.Y. Bennett G.N. Berrios-Rivera S.J. Vadali R.V. Yang Y.T. Horton E. Rudolph F.B. Sariyar B. Blackwood K. Metab. Eng. 2002; 4: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, M. tuberculosis cultures were grown to an A650 of 0.3 and treated with drugs for 3 h. At this stage, cells were rapidly harvested (two 2-ml samples) and resuspended in 0.2 m HCl (NAD+ determination) or 0.2 m NaOH (NADH determination). Nucleotide extraction was further facilitated by bead beating of the suspensions with 0.2-ml glass beads (40 s, maximum speed). Extracts were further prepared, and enzyme assays were performed as previously described (18San K.Y. Bennett G.N. Berrios-Rivera S.J. Vadali R.V. Yang Y.T. Horton E. Rudolph F.B. Sariyar B. Blackwood K. Metab. Eng. 2002; 4: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). All determinations were repeated in at least three independent experiments.Menaquinol/Menaquinone Analysis—Cultures were grown to an A650 of 0.3 and treated for 3 h with drug or solvent alone. Menaquinone and menaquinol were extracted as described (19Krivankova L. Dadak V. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 67: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (Hewlett-Packard 1100) using a C18 column with detection by DAD at UV 266 nm. All extractions were repeated at least three independent times.Intracellular ATP Determinations—These assays were done on cultures of M. tuberculosis containing an integrated luciferase gene from pMV306-groELluc grown to an A650 of 0.1-0.2 and treated with drug for 20-120 min. ATP levels were determined by bioluminescence as previously described (20Slayden R.A. Lee R.E. Barry III, C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).MTT Assays—M. smegmatis at an A650 of 0.2 was treated with drug or vehicle alone for 15 min (100 μl/well in 96-well plates in quadruplicate) before the addition of 25 μl of 2 mg/ml MTT. The reaction was stopped after 30 min by the addition of 25 μl of 10% SDS, and the absorbance at 595 nm was recorded. The assay was repeated two independent times.RESULTSDe Novo Analysis of Expression Data Results in Mechanism of Action-based Clustering of Transcriptional Responses—Transcriptional profiling of M. tuberculosis was performed using 430 whole-genome microarrays to measure the effects of 75 different drugs, drug combinations, or different growth conditions at various times relative to a sample of logarithmically growing M. tuberculosis. The drug concentrations and time points (see Supplementary Data) were chosen such that 10% or less of the total number of genes were differentially (2-fold or more) regulated and through consulting previously published studies (2Betts J.C. McLaren A. Lennon M.G. Kelly F.M. Lukey P.T. Blakemore S.J. Duncan K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2903-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3Wilson M. DeRisi J. Kristensen H.H. Imboden P. Rane S. Brown P.O. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12833-12838Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Expression of highly responsive genes within certain drug groups was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (see Supplementary Data). The quality of these data were tested using Pearson rank tests, which verified that arrays within each treatment group were highly correlated (Fig. 1). Log-transformed expression ratios were standardized according to the pan-array distribution for each gene and then averaged according to treatment. To analyze these data, unsupervised clustering methods were applied to the 345 expression profiles. Expression data sets of genes that were up or down-regulated at least 3-fold in four or more experiments were analyzed by agglomerative hierarchical clustering method (21Sherlock G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) to identify drug groupings based on gross analysis of coordinately regulated genes (Fig. 2). This revealed that groups of drugs clustered separately based on known mechanisms of action. Thus, protein synthesis inhibitors, transcriptional inhibitors, aromatic amides, cell wall synthesis inhibitors and agents that damage DNA fell into distinct groups. These observations were further supported by a prediction matrix using the Pearson correlation over the entire array of genes to predict the treatment group (Fig. 1). This showed that the individual profiles of drug treatments were accurately classified to groups of agents with similar predicted modes of action. The majority of apparent “mispredictions” of well characterized inhibitors in this matrix, usually correlated with agents within the same treatment group.Fig. 1Prediction matrix using Pearson correlation over the entire array of genes to assess accuracy of classification of individual arrays. Individual arrays from each treatment group (columns, n = 430) were compared with the collection of averaged array representation computed to be characteristic of each treatment group (rows). The treatment group with the top average score was taken as the “prediction” for that array. Matrix numbers are counts of individual arrays predicted to match with the averaged array representing a treatment group. Major treatment groups (class of inhibitor) are color-coded as follows: violet, growth in minimal medium with palmitate or succinate as carbon sources as compared with glucose as carbon source; lavender, growth in acidified medium; blue, aromatic amides that can be hydrolyzed intracellularly; light blue, agents that inhibit cell wall synthesis; pale blue, agents that affect DNA integrity or topology; green, inhibitors of protein synthesis; yellow, growth under conditions that were associated with expression of the dosR regulon; light green, agents besides NO that inhibit respiration, and TRC; pink, transcriptional inhibitors; orange, nutrient starvation in PBST or TBST; red, pyridoacridones and iron scavengers. The black boxes are correct assignments within the treatment class.

Average linkage clustering of expression profiles of genes that were up- or down-regulated at least 3-fold in four or more experiments.

Pyridoacridone clusters 1 and 2 correspond to low (5× MIC) and high (10× MIC) concentrations, respectively.

Many of these clusters contained genes that were functionally related, but many also contained genes that encoded proteins of unknown function.Genes previously shown to be members of the DosR- and RecA-controlled regulons (4Voskuil M.I. Schnappinger D. Visconti K.C. Harrell M.I. Dolganov G.M. Sherman D.R. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 11Boshoff H.I. Reed M.B.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3287-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were independently identified by this process of gene clustering. Gene cluster 39 (GC39), for example, contained 21 of the 48 members of the dormancy regulon, and three closely linked clusters (GC126, -56, and -137) contained 38 genes previously reported to be up-regulated by DNA damage.The Metabolic Response to Inhibition of Translation—Analysis of the cellular response to translational inhibition revealed a general down-regulation of macromolecular synthesis, as expected, although there was an evident attempt to increase synthesis of the translational apparatus. Up-regulated genes included those implicated in ribosomal architecture and translation (e.g. GC28, -36, -70, -71, -90, and -118) whereas down-regulated genes included aspects of macromolecular metabolism similar to those responsive to starvation (e.g. ppk and relA). Regulation of these genes did not appear to be mediated by the stringent response through ppGpp, since relA was down-regulated. Interestingly, Rv1026 (encoding a possible pppGpp-5′-phosphohydrolase that would hydrolyze any residual mediator of the stringent response (23Primm T.P. Andersen S.J. Mizrahi V. Avarbock D. Rubin H. Barry III, C.E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4889-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar)) was up-regulated during translational inhibition and down-regulated during starvation. The observed up-regulation of the inorganic pyrophosphatase encoded by ppa would probably slow ribosomal degradation (24Kuroda A. Nomura K. Ohtomo R. Kato J. Ikeda T. Takiguchi N. Ohtake H. Kornberg A. Science. 2001; 293: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and also contrasts with the down-regulation of this gene during starvation. Not surprisingly, ppa is part of a regulon (GC71) containing genes implicated in translation, and, combined with the observed down-regulation of ppk (a polyphosphate kinase), this suggests an important role for polyphosphate in mycobacterial adaption to translational inhibition (25Zhang H. Ishige K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16678-16683Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).A gene cluster containing the gene encoding the regulatory protein of pyrimidine biosynthesis (pyrR) (GC69) was also up-regulated, consistent with the observed down-regulation of expression of several genes involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis, whereas genes involved in purine and pyrimidine salvage (apt, gmk, prsA, thyA, and cdd) and conversion of nucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (nrdF1, nrdF2, nrdH, and nrdI) were up-regulated upon translational inhibition.Aminoglycosides were associated with an up-regulation of heat shock proteins (GC134), presumably resulting from mis-translation-induced aberrant peptides in the cytoplasm as has been observed for other bacteria (26Ng T.B. Lam S.K. Fong W.P. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Tetracycline and roxithromycin did not induce this response, consistent with the fact that they block release of the nascent peptide during translational inhibition.Our analysis also suggested that translational inhibition results in inhibition of DNA replication and the processing of replication forks. The down-regulation of several genes supports this hypothesis, including the following: Rv1708 (possible role in initiation of replication); the major replicative DNA polymerase (11Boshoff H.I. Reed M.B. Barry III, C.E. Mizrahi V. Cell. 2003; 113: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar); and DnaA, which plays a role in initiation of chromosomal replication. Likewise, genes implicated in turnover of DNA were up-regulated, including nth, recR, hupB, recF, and ssb. This did not result in a signal that was relayed as DNA damage, however, since recA and dnaE2 (11Boshoff H.I. Reed M.B. Barry III, C.E. Mizrahi V. Cell. 2003; 113: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) were not up-regulated.The Metabolic Response to Inhibitors of DNA Transcription and Gyrase Function—Unsurprisingly, the mode of action of transcriptional inhibitors such as rifamycins could best be described as a global down-regulation of most gene clusters, including the ribonucleotide reductase genes (GC49), heat shock proteins (GC134), and several ribosomal genes. Despite this, some transcript levels were elevated, but this was probably due to differential mRNA stabilities.Fluoroquinolones bind gyrase and topoisomerase IV on DNA, blocking transcription and replication and resulting in DNA damage (27Drlica K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). DNA damage also results from treatment with UV irradiation, H2O2, and mitomycin C. All of these treatments resulted in the up-regulation of the previously characterized (11Boshoff H.I. Reed M.B. Barry III, C.E. Mizrahi V. Cell. 2003; 113: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 28Rand L. Hinds J. Springer B. Sander P. Buxton R.S. Davis E.O. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) SOS gene clusters (GC56, -126, and -137) as well as several DNA repair-associated genes that were not correlated with this regulon. The gyrase inhibitor novobiocin does not induce double-stranded breaks (29Gormley N.A. Orphanides G. Meyer A. Cullis P.M. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and did not cluster with those agents that did. Novobiocin affected the expression of a more limited subset of DNA repair or structural maintenance genes including the up-regulation of the RecA-independent, Y family polymerase member encoded by dinP. The effects of fluoroquinolones (including novobiocin) could be distinguished from the other forms of DNA damage employed in this study by the unique up-regulation of the class Ib ribonucleotide reductase genes (GC49) as well as nrdF1.Deoxyribonucleotide pools are regulated by the activity of ribonucleotide reductase and are"

Biochemical studies showed the onset of a fully active autophagic activity both in wild-type and Δuth1 strains. On the other hand, the disorganization of the mitochondrial network induced by rapamycin treatment or 15 h of nitrogen starvation was followed in cells expressing mitochondria-targeted green fluorescent protein; a rapid colocalization of green fluorescent protein fluorescence with vacuole-selective FM4-64 labeling was observed in the wild-type but not in the Δuth1 strain. Degradation of mitochondrial proteins, followed by Western blot analysis, did not occur in mutant strains carrying null mutations of the vacuolar protease Pep4p, the autophagy-specific protein Atg5p, and Uth1p. These data show that, although the autophagic machinery was fully functional in the absence of Uth1p, this protein is involved in the autophagic degradation of mitochondria.

The major cellular degradation pathways involved in protein and organelle turnover are autophagy and proteasome-mediated proteolysis. These processes are important for maintaining a controlled balance between anabolism and catabolism in order to have normal cell growth and development. These degradation pathways permit the cell to eliminate unwanted or unnecessary organelles and recycle the components for reuse. In eukaryotic cells, the lysosomes or the vacuole are major degradative organelles that contain a range of hydrolases able of degrading all the cellular constituents. During the last decade, autophagy has emerged as a crucial membrane trafficking process that transports bulk cytoplasm and sometimes entire organelles to the lysosome/vacuole for recycling in response to nutrient starvation or under specific physiological conditions (see Refs. 1Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar and 2Abeliovich H. Klionsky D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar for reviews). Autophagy has two major forms, microautophagy and macroautophagy. Microautophagy operates by protruding or invaginating a portion of the vacuolar membrane to engulf cytosol or organelles. Only limited knowledge is available about microautophagy, which has been best characterized for the degradation of peroxisomes (3Sakai Y. Koller A. Rangell L.K. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4Yuan W. Tuttle D.L. Shi Y.J. Ralph G.S. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and selective portions of the nucleus (5Roberts P. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S. Kvam E. O'Toole E. Winey M. Goldfarb D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy, of which the molecular aspects are better characterized, involves the non-selective sequestration of large portions of the cytoplasm into double membrane structures termed autophagosomes and their delivery to the vacuole for degradation. Although the normal function of autophagy is thought to provide amino acids to starved cells, a fair amount of evidence suggests that it could also be required for the elimination of selected organelles, namely mitochondria, under peculiar conditions. In mammalian cells, autophagic removal of mitochondria has been shown to be triggered following a process of induction/blockade of apoptosis (6Xue L. Fletcher G.C. Tolkovsky A.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 180-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 7Xue L. Fletcher G.C. Tolkovsky A.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 361-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Also, coregulation of apoptosis and autophagy by the Akt/protein kinase B-signaling pathway has been evidenced (8Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 9Arico S. Petiot A. Bauvy C. Dubbelhuis P.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. Ogier-Denis E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35243-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Finally, molecular data suggest that autophagy-specific proteins might also be involved in the regulation of apoptosis (10Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). Because mitochondrial events are now regarded as a crucial step in apoptosis, this idea indicates that damaged mitochondria (following apoptotic induction) could control their own degradation by an autophagic process (11Tolkovsky A.M. Xue L. Fletcher A.M. Borutaite V. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This possibility is also supported by the observation that the overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, is able to block autophagy (12Roberts M.L. Virdee K. Sampson C.P. Gordon I. Tolkovsky A.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that down-regulation of Bcl-2 induces autophagy (13Saeki K. Yuo A. Okuma E. Yazaki Y. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Takaku F. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Also, the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, often considered to be a crucial event regulating the initial steps of apoptosis, induces the colocalization of mitochondrial and lysosomal markers, which is typical of an autophagic process in mammalian cells (14Elmore S.P. Qian T. Grissom S.F. Lemasters J.J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2286-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In yeast, a study reported the presence of mitochondria in autophagosomes following autophagy induction by nitrogen starvation (15Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Under natural conditions, yeast often faces environmental changes requiring a modulation of its mitochondrial content (reviewed in Refs. 16Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Thorsness P.E. Mutat. Res. 1992; 275: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, and 18Rep M. Grivell L.A. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For example, the shift from a respiratory carbon source to a fermentative carbon source or, more drastically, the shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions is accompanied by a decrease of both the amount and the enzymatic equipment of mitochondria. Clearly, the inhibition of mitochondrial biogenesis is likely to play an important role in these changes (19Tzagoloff A. Myers A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 249-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 20De Winde J.H. Grivell L.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 51-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) but might not be enough to explain the rapid disappearance of cohorts of mitochondria. One study, based on a mutant inactivated in the mitochondrial protease Yme1p, suggests that alterations of mitochondrial biogenesis are able to trigger mitochondrial autophagy (21Campbell C.L. Thorsness P.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2455-2464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shafer K.S. Hanekamp T. White K.H. Thorsness P.E. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). But hypotheses about the role of mitochondria in their own degradation remain highly speculative, because a molecular support for these hypotheses is still lacking (2Abeliovich H. Klionsky D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used the autophagy-inducing drug rapamycin or physiological autophagy induced by nitrogen starvation to provide evidence that mitochondria are early targets of autophagic degradation in yeast, and we identified for the first time that a mitochondrial protein, Uth1p, is involved in this process. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—W303-1B (MATa, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, can1) was used as the wild-type strain. The Δuth1 strain was constructed from W303-1B as described previously (23Camougrand N. Mouassite M. Velours G. Guérin M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Δatg5 strain was constructed by disruption of the ATG5 gene with the KanMX4 cassette in the W303-1B strain. Δpep4, derived from the wild-type strain BY4742 (MATa, his3, leu2, ura3, met15), was obtained from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). For the measurement of ALP 1The abbreviations used are: ALP, alkaline phosphatase; API, aminopeptidase 1; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; FM4-64, N-[3-triethylammoniumpropyl]-4-[p-diethylaminophenyl-hexatrienyl] pyridinium dibromide; mtGFP, mitochondria-targeted green fluorescent protein. activity, the PHO8 locus was replaced with PHO8Δ60 in each strain by transformation with an HindIII fragment of the plasmid pTN9 (a gift from Y. Ohsumi, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan) bearing PHO8Δ60 as described previously (24Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For fluorescent microscopy experiments the cells were transformed with the plasmid pGAL-CLbGFP containing the presequence of mitochondrial citrate synthase fused to GFP under the control of a GAL1/10 promoter, as described (25Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which was provided by J. P. di Rago (Institut de Biochimie et Génétique Cellulaires, Bordeaux, France). Yeast cells were grown aerobically at 28 °C in a complete medium (1% yeast extract, 0.1% potassium phosphate, and 0.12% ammonium sulfate) or a minimal YNB medium (yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and with 0.175% ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.1% potassium phosphate, 0.2% Drop-Mix, and 0.01% auxotrophic requirements, pH 5.5) supplemented with 2% glucose or 2% lactate as a carbon source. Nitrogen starvation medium (SD-N) contained 0.175% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate and 2% glucose or 2% lactate, respectively. To induce pGAL-CLbGFP expression, cells were grown overnight in an appropriate medium supplemented with 2% galactose. Rapamycin treatments were done with 0.2 μg/ml rapamycin by using a stock solution of 100 μg/ml rapamycin (Calbiochem) in 90% ethanol and 10% Triton X-100. Plating Efficiency—The viability of cells was determined as plating efficiency. The cells were counted at indicates times and diluted, and aliquots with identical numbers of cells (5 × 102) were plated on solid complete YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) or YPL (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% lactate) medium, respectively. The number of colonies was scored after 2-3 days of growth at 28 °C. The viability of cells in each sample was expressed as the percentage of colonies produced by the plating of the same aliquots of culture at time 0. Western Blot Analyses—Protein samples preparation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were done as described previously (26Camougrand N. Grelaud-Coq A. Marza E. Priault M. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-yeast Cox2p (1/2000e; Molecular Probes), mouse monoclonal anti-yeast porin (1/2000e; Molecular Probes), mouse monoclonal anti-yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (1/2000e; Molecular Probes), goat polyclonal anti-aminopeptidase I (1/100e; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti-yeast Atg8p (1/250e; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit polyclonal anti-yeast actin (1/1000e; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-goat IgG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Laboratories) were used at 1/10000e. An ECL+ kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for protein detection. Quantification of protein amounts was done using the ImageJ program (NCBI). Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—ALP activity assays using α-naphthyl phosphate (Sigma) as a substrate were performed on cells that had been treated with rapamycin (0.2 μg/ml) for 2 h or nitrogen-starved for 15 h according to the method described (27Nothwehr S.R. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was measured at 472 nm (excitation at 345 nm) in a Safas spectrofluorometer. Protein concentration was measured with the Lowry method (28Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ALP activities were expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units/min/mg protein. Fluorescence Microscopy Measurements—Vacuoles were stained with N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethylaminophenyl-hexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide (FM4-64; final concentration of 40 μm) according to a modified method as described previously (29Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). mtGFP-expressing cells stained with FM4-64 were visualized on a Leica microscope. The images were acquired with an SIS camera and processed with Corel Draw 9.0 suite software. The Product of the UTH1 Gene Is Involved in the Response to Rapamycin—It has been shown previously that inactivation of the UTH1 gene induces resistance to rapamycin as well as to the heterologous expression of the human pro-apoptotic protein Bax, suggesting that Uth1p might be at the crossroads of different signals converging on mitochondria and leading to death (26Camougrand N. Grelaud-Coq A. Marza E. Priault M. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Physiological autophagy induced by nitrogen starvation does not lead to cell death. On the contrary, strains impaired for autophagy, such as the Δatg5 mutant, do not survive nitrogen starvation (30Kametaka S. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Gene. 1996; 178: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). But overactivation of autophagy by rapamycin treatment induces growth arrest. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the growth of the Δuth1 mutant exhibits rapamycin resistance when cells were spotted on a solid medium. This resistance is more marked than that of the autophagy-deficient Δatg5 mutant. The effect of rapamycin was further assayed on the viability of cells grown on glucose (fermentation-dependent growth; Fig. 1C) or lactate-supplemented medium (respiration-dependent growth; Fig. 1D). Rapamycin induces a loss of viability of wild-type and Δatg5 strains, but the Δuth1 strain exhibited a strong resistance. It is noteworthy that this resistance was more marked on lactate-supplemented medium (Fig. 1D) where yeast cells develop large and fully active mitochondria, because this carbon source is exclusively oxidized by mitochondrial metabolic pathways (31De Vries S. Marres C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Whatever the carbon source, under nitrogen starvation conditions, a better survival rate was observed for the Δuth1 strain in comparison with the wild-type, the autophagy-deficient Δatg5 mutant, and the Δpep4 mutant, which is deficient in the major vacuolar hydrolase, proteinase A (Fig. 2). Autophagic Machinery Is Not Affected in Δuth1 Cells—We were interested in examining the cellular autophagic activity in the Δuth1 mutant to know if the observed resistance to rapamycin was due to a general blockage of the autophagic process. Several biochemical methods for assaying autophagy have been established. One improved method (24Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) is to follow the vacuolar delivery of the Pho8Δ60p, a cytosolic variant of the Pho8p alkaline phosphatase in which the membrane-spanning region and the vacuolar targeting sequence have been deleted. Such an N-terminal truncated Pho8Δ60p variant cannot be delivered to the vacuolar compartment via the normal secretory pathway and is only imported to the vacuole upon the induction of autophagy, when cells are shifted to nitrogen starvation conditions or treated with rapamycin. The vacuolar delivery of randomly sequestrated Pho8Δ60p in autophagic vesicles results in cleavage of the C-terminal propeptide in a proteinase B-dependent manner and activation of its enzyme activity. In our study, ALP activity was assayed in wild-type cells and Δuth1 and Δatg5 mutant strains grown on glucose-(Fig. 3A) or lactate-supplemented (Fig. 3B) minimal medium after a 1-h rapamycin treatment or 15 h of nitrogen starvation, respectively. The level of autophagy was indicated by the difference in enzymatic activity found at time 0 (control) and under these two conditions. At time 0 all tested strains exhibited approximately the same basal activity, which was probably due to the participation of Pho13p, another alkaline phosphatase that is constitutively active, in the reaction (32Tuleva B. Vasileva-Tonkova E. Galabova D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 139-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the Δatg5 strain, where the autophagic process was impaired and, consequently, Pho8Δ60p cannot be delivered to the vacuole, no increase of ALP after rapamycin treatment or under starvation conditions was observed. Under the same conditions, ALP activity was significantly increased both in the wild-type and the Δuth1 strains whatever the condition of induction. The highest autophagic activity was found in starved Δuth1 mutant cells, when ALP activity was increased five times. Another method for measuring autophagic activity is to follow the processing of the vacuolar aminopeptidase I (API) in starved cells (33Baba M. Oshumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). API is synthesized on soluble ribosomes as a 61-kDa inactive precursor that is transported to the vacuole in nutrient-rich conditions by a constitutive non-classical vesicular transport mechanism, the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway, and is submitted to proteolytic maturation leading to a 50-kDa form. Under starvation conditions or in presence of rapamycin, API is transported to the vacuole by macroautophagy. Total protein extracts were prepared from cultures of wild-type and Δuth1 strains grown on glucose-containing minimal medium and after 15 h of nitrogen starvation. An immunoblot with an antibody specific for API was done to monitor precursor API processing (Fig. 4). Under starvation conditions, only the mature form was visualized in wild-type and Δuth1 strains showing the activation of autophagy. Taken together, these two sets of experiments (ALP activity and API maturation) showed that the autophagy process was unaffected in the Δuth1 mutant. The Product of UTH1 Is Required for Vacuolar Degradation of Mitochondria-Targeted GFP—According to the localization of Uth1p in the external mitochondrial membrane (34Velours G. Boucheron C. Manon S. Camougrand N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 207: 165-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the degradation of mitochondria was investigated further. A construction expressing GFP fused downstream of the targeting sequence of mitochondrial citrate synthase (mtGFP) (25Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was introduced in wild-type, Δuth1, and Δatg5 strains in order to follow the behavior of mitochondria in situ. The autofluorescent probe FM4-64, which specifically labels the vacuolar membrane in yeast cells (29Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), was used simultaneously. Under control conditions, wild-type cells grown on a lactate and galactose-supplemented medium exhibit a well differentiated mitochondrial network, and FM4-64 labeling shows the presence of one or two large vacuoles (Fig. 5). Rapamycin treatment of wild-type cells induced the disappearance of the mitochondrial network and the appearance of patches predominantly at the periphery of the cells. Most cells lost the classical vacuolar membrane FM4-64 staining, and only few cells showed faintly stained vacuoles. The proportion of cells in which FM4-64 fluorescence was lost from vacuolar membranes to give rise to diffused cytoplasmic staining corresponded with the proportion of dead cells (85%; see Fig. 1D). The remaining 15% of the cells, which were still viable after a 2-h rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1D), exhibited intensely punctuated FM4-64 staining, with some of them colocalizing with mtGFP as shown in Fig. 5. The same perturbation of vacuolar membrane staining after rapamycin treatment was observed for glucose-grown cells treated with rapamycin (data not shown). The expression of mtGFP in Δuth1 and Δatg5 mutants also revealed a normal mitochondrial network (Fig. 5). Opposite to the case with wild-type, the addition of rapamycin to both mutants did not induce any rapid disorganization of the mitochondrial network that remained intact after a 2-h treatment (Fig. 5), and the network was marginally affected after a 6-h treatment (not shown). No colocalization of mtGFP and FM4-64 was ever observed in these strains. Interestingly, FM4-64 staining of vacuolar membranes showed the presence of a large number of small fragmented vacuoles in Δuth1 as described in some mutants defective in vacuolar biogenesis and autophagy, such as in the Δatg5 strain (Fig. 5) (35Banta L.M. Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1369-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To verify that rapamycin treatment did not induce any side effects by affecting mtGFP synthesis or import, cells were incubated in the presence of cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis) or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; an uncoupler dissipating transmembrane electrical potential). For the time of the experiment, the mitochondrial network remained unaffected by these treatments in both the wild-type (Fig. 6) and the Δuth1 strains (not shown). Under conditions of physiologically induced autophagy by nitrogen starvation, the appearance of patches of mtGFP at the periphery of the cells and the concomitant disappearance of the mitochondrial network were also observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 7). Moreover, co-staining with FM4-64 revealed the presence of some portion of mtGFP in the vacuoles (Fig. 7). Both phenomena were completely absent in control cells growing in rich medium (Fig. 5). In accordance with the deficiency of autophagy, no signs of mitochondria degradation were ever observed in Δatg5 mutant cells under the same conditions (Fig. 7). In the culture of a Δuth1 strain starved for 15 h, the following two distinct behaviors were observed. (i) About half of the cells exhibited normal FM4-64 staining and an intact mitochondrial network like that of the Δatg5 mutant. (ii) The other half exhibited some hallmarks of a weak autophagy process, with patches of mtGFP at the periphery of the cells and vacuolar delivery of mtGFP but also the visible presence of a residual mitochondrial network (Fig. 7). Uth1p Is Required for the Early Vacuolar Degradation of Mitochondrial Proteins—The time course of autophagy induction by rapamycin was also followed as the increase in the content of Atg8p, which is essential for the formation of autophagosomes (36Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 37Kim J. Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. J.

In accordance with this observation, we observed an increase of the intracellular content of Atg8p after the addition of rapamycin in all tested strains growing under strict respiratory conditions (Fig. 8). The amounts of several mitochondrial proteins localized in the outer (the mitochondrial porin Por1p) and inner (the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2, Cox2p) mitochondrial membranes were followed by Western blot analyses in comparison with proteins localized in cytosol phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1p) and actin (Act1p) (Fig. 8). In the wild-type strain, the content of both mitochondrial proteins was strongly depressed 2 h after the beginning of rapamycin treatment and further decreased over a 6-h treatment. Under the same conditions, the amounts of cytosolic proteins were only marginally affected. When the wild-type cells were grown on glucose, this more rapid decrease of mitochondrial proteins was also observed (not shown). To verify that the rapamycin-induced decrease of the two mitochondrial proteins was actually caused by vacuolar proteolysis and not by a blockade of their synthesis, the experiment was reproduced in a Δpep4 strain (Fig. 8). The amounts of Por1p and Cox2p did not decrease after a 6-h rapamycin treatment, whereas in fact a slight increase was actually observed. This lack of degradation in Δpep4 cells confirms that the protein degradation observed in wild-type cells is executed in the vacuoles. Rapamycin treatment of the autophagy-deficient Δatg5 strain grown on lactate induced a higher increase of Atg8p in wild-type (Fig. 8); this is in accordance with the fact that the process of autophagosome formation and the subsequent vacuolar degradation of Atg8p is blocked in this mutant. Concerning mitochondrial proteins, no decrease in the amounts of Por1p and Cox2p was observed, but, as in the Δpep4 mutant, a slight increase was recorded instead. From this set of experiments it was seen that rapamycin treatment of cells grown under strict respiratory conditions induces the early degradation of mitochondrial proteins by a process that requires the following: (i) the formation of autophagosomes; and (ii) vacuolar proteolysis. During the short course of the experiment cytosolic proteins remain poorly affected, suggesting that fully differentiated organelles like mitochondria are early targets of the rapamycin-induced process. Also, Por1p and Cox2p, which are localized on different membranes, are degraded together, suggesting that whole mitochondria are targeted by the process. In accordance with the resistance of the Δuth1 strain to rapamycin (Fig. 1), degradation of the two mitochondrial proteins was largely impaired in this strain (Fig. 8). On other hand, the product of ATG8 increased up to a level similar to that of the wild-type strain (Fig. 8), confirming the conclusion drawn from the measurement of ALP activity (Fig. 3) and API processing (Fig. 4) that the autophagic process is still active. This supports the view that the resistance of the Δuth1 strain is not caused by a general defect in the autophagic machinery but that the mitochondrial degradation targeted by this machinery is delayed. Data reported in this paper allowed us to identify conditions where a rapid degradation of mitochondria by rapamycin treatment or nitrogen starvation growth could be visualized. Within 2 h of rapamycin treatment, mitochondrial proteins are degraded in a way that depends on the following: (i) autophagosomes formation, because it is prevented by atg5-inactivation; and (ii) vacuolar degradation, because it is prevented by pep4 inactivation. This degradation of mitochondrial proteins correlates with the disappearance of the mitochondrial network and the appearance of a mitochondrial/vacuole co-staining. This mitochondrial degradation does not occur in strains impaired for autophagy such as the Δatg5 mutant. Opposite to the case with the Δatg5 mutant, the autophagic machinery remains fully active in Δuth1 mutant, but mitochondria degradation by this process is delayed. These results showed that the mitochondrial protein Uth1p is involved in autophagic mitochondrial degradation. This protein, Uth1p, has been initially found in a genetic screen aiming to identify proteins involved in the regulation of the yeast life span (38Austriaco N.R. Yeast. 1996; 12: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was found to be a member of the so-called “SUN” family, which includes four proteins having a very high degree of identity (23Camougrand N. Mouassite M. Velours G. Guérin M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39Mouassite M. Camougrand N. Schwob E. Demaison G. Laclau M. Guérin M. Yeast. 2000; 16: 905-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The product of UTH1 exhibits some remarkable properties. It is mainly localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane (34Velours G. Boucheron C. Manon S. Camougrand N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 207: 165-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but was also found in the cell wall (34Velours G. Boucheron C. Manon S. Camougrand N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 207: 165-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bandara P.D.S. Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Grant C.M. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This alternative cell wall localization is likely to have a physiological meaning, because it can be selectively suppressed by point mutations in the protein. 2N. Camougrand, I. Kissová, M. Deffieu, and S. Manon, unpublished data. The absence of Uth1p does not have dramatic consequences under normal growth conditions; it induced a 15-25% decrease of mitochondrial cytochromes as well as other mitochondrial enzymes and an increase of growth yield (23Camougrand N. Mouassite M. Velours G. Guérin M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This higher metabolic efficiency, linked to a general but slight slowing down of mitochondrial functions, is likely to explain the extended life span as well as the modified response to oxidative stress exhibited by this mutant (41Camougrand N. Rigoulet M. Respir. Physiol. 2001; 128: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). More recently, Uth1p was found to be involved in yeast cell death induced by the heterologous expression of the human proapoptotic protein Bax (26Camougrand N. Grelaud-Coq A. Marza E. Priault M. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As in mammalian cells, Bax targets the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it induces the formation of a large channel likely involved in the mitochondria-to-cytosol relocalization of cytochrome c (42Manon S. Chaudhuri B. Guérin M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 43Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A.

Kinnally K.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1109-C1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Bax-induced characteristics in yeast resemble apoptotic like hallmarks induced by H2O2 treatment (45Madeo F. Fröhlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) in which a caspase-like activity might be involved (46Madeo F. Herke E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Feh M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). However, cytochrome c release is not mandatory to Bax-induced cell death in yeast (47Priault M. Chaudhuri B. Clow A. Camougrand N. Manon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, because Uth1p is not involved in the mitochondrial targeting of Bax or in cytochrome c release activity (26Camougrand N. Grelaud-Coq A. Marza E. Priault M. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we proposed that Bax was able to activate an alternative death-inducing pathway involving Uth1p. As a matter of fact, Uth1p overexpression was found to induce cell death, and uth1 inactivation induced a resistance of growth to rapamycin (26Camougrand N. Grelaud-Coq A. Marza E. Priault M. Bessoule J.J. Manon S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that Uth1p might be involved in a death pathway related to autophagy. The observation reported in the present paper that Uth1p is involved in the autophagic degradation of mitochondria induced by rapamycin or nitrogen starvation supports this hypothesis. Clearly, Uth1p does not participate in the autophagic machinery, because the biochemical hallmarks related to this process (ALP activation and API processing) are as active as those in wild-type, in contrast to the behavior of the autophagy-deficient strain Δatg5. More likely, Uth1p might be involved in the recognition of mitochondria by the autophagic machinery. However, it should be noted that, both from viability and fluorescence microscopy experiments, about half of Δuth1 cells are still able to undergo normal mitochondria autophagy, suggesting that Uth1p may not be the only protein involved in the process. The degradation process termed autophagy covers distinct, although related, phenomena. The best characterized, and also the less specific, is the macroautophagy of large parts of the cytoplasm including the organelles (reviewed in Ref. 2Abeliovich H. Klionsky D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 463-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, more selective phenomena were also evidenced. As an example, microautophagy of the nucleus via the physical contact between nuclei and vacuoles was shown to involve selective protein-protein interactions such as Nvj1p on the nuclear envelope and Vac8p on the vacuolar membrane (5Roberts P. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S. Kvam E. O'Toole E. Winey M. Goldfarb D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This process does not involve the well established components of macroautophagy signaling but is still under the control of the TOR (target of rapamycin) kinase pathway. Another example of selective autophagy was observed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, where peroxisomes can be selectively degraded by vacuoles in a way independent from macroautophagy (3Sakai Y. Koller A. Rangell L.K. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The degradation of other organelles has not been investigated to date, but tools such as selectively targeted GFP and specific antibodies are now available for such studies. Concerning yeast mitochondria, since the first report that they could be engulfed by the macroautophagy machinery (15Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), one study has suggested that a selective mechanism of mitochondria autophagy also occurred in yeast, i.e. inactivation of the mitochondrial AAA-type protease Yme1p leads to a vacuole-dependent mitochondria-to-nucleus transfer of genetic material (21Campbell C.L. Thorsness P.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2455-2464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shafer K.S. Hanekamp T. White K.H. Thorsness P.E. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of this transfer has not been identified to date. The finding that Uth1p is a component involved in the early selective degradation of mitochondria is now a basis for the identification of the other components involved in the autophagic degradation of mitochondria. This might be of general interest, not only in yeast but also, given the recent evidence of connections between apoptosis and autophagy, in mammalian cells (48Ogier-Denis E. Codogno P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1603: 113-128PubMed Google Scholar)."

A dominant missense mutation (R225Q) in pig PRKAG3, encoding the muscle-specific γ3 isoform, causes a marked increase in glycogen content. To determine the functional role of the AMPK γ3 isoform, we generated transgenic mice with skeletal muscle-specific expression of wild type or mutant (225Q) mouse γ3 as well as Prkag3 knockout mice. Glycogen resynthesis after exercise was impaired in AMPK γ3 knock-out mice and markedly enhanced in transgenic mutant mice. An AMPK activator failed to increase skeletal muscle glucose uptake in AMPK γ3 knock-out mice, whereas contraction effects were preserved. When placed on a high fat diet, transgenic mutant mice but not knock-out mice were protected against excessive triglyceride accumulation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Transfection experiments reveal the R225Q mutation is associated with higher basal AMPK activity and diminished AMP dependence. Our results validate the muscle-specific AMPK γ3 isoform as a therapeutic target for prevention and treatment of insulin resistance. 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic stress sensor present in all eukaryotes.

Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 2Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.P. Witters L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The mammalian genome contains seven AMPK genes encoding two α, two β, and three γ isoforms. AMPK signaling is elicited by cellular stresses that deplete ATP (and consequently elevate AMP) by either inhibiting ATP production (e.g. hypoxia) or accelerating ATP consumption (e.g. muscle contraction). AMPK is activated allosterically by AMP and through phosphorylation of Thr172 in the α subunit by an upstream AMPK kinase, the tumor-suppressor protein kinase LKB1 (3Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A.

AMPK is likely to be important for diverse functions in many cell types, but particular interest has been focused on elucidating the role of AMPK in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle (5Hayashi T.

AMPK activity has been correlated with an increase in glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation and an inhibition of glycogen synthase activity and fatty acid synthesis. Exercise, as well as skeletal muscle contractions in vitro, leads to AMPK activation. Pharmacological activation of AMPK also can be achieved using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribonucleoside (AICAR). Once taken up by the cell, AICAR is phosphorylated to 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside monophosphate (ZMP) and mimics effects of AMP on AMPK (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 2Kemp B.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.P. Witters L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). AMPK function is closely related to glycogen storage. AMPK phosphorylates glycogen synthase in vitro (11Carling D. Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1012: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and co-immunoprecipitates with glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase from skeletal muscle (12Chen Z. Heierhorst J. Mann R.J.

Mutations of the γ3or γ2 subunit, respectively, affect glycogen storage in pigs (13Milan D. Jeon J.T. Looft C. Amarger V. Thelander M. Robic A. Rogel-Gaillard C. Paul S. Iannuccelli N. Rask L.

The recent identification of a glycogen-binding domain in the AMPK β1 subunit provides a molecular relationship between AMPK and glycogen (16Hudson E. Pan D. James J. Lucocq J. Hawley S. Green K.

The formation of heterotrimers appears to be rather promiscuous, and the different subunits (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2, and γ3) can form a maximum of 12 different AMPK heterotrimers. The functional diversification of the different isoforms is largely unknown. The dominant Rendement Napole (RN) phenotype identified in Hampshire pigs is associated with a single missense mutation (R225Q) in PRKAG3, encoding the muscle-specific AMPK γ3 isoform (13Milan D. Jeon J.T. Looft C. Amarger V. Thelander M. Robic A. Rogel-Gaillard C. Paul S. Iannuccelli N. Rask L. Ronne H. Lundström K. Reinsch N. Gellin J. Kalm E. Le Roy P. Chardon P. Andersson L. Science. 2000; 288: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). RN pigs have a ∼70% increase in glycogen content in glycolytic skeletal muscle, whereas liver and heart glycogen content is unchanged (18Estrade M. Vignon X. Rock E. Monin G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1993; 104B: 321-326Google Scholar, 19.Monin, G., Brard, C., Vernin, P. & Naveau, J. (1992) in 38th International Congress on Meat Science and Technology, Vol. 3, pp. 391–394, Clermont-Ferrand, FranceGoogle Scholar). The mutation has a large impact on meat characteristics and leads to a low pH because of the anaerobic glycogen degradation occurring postmortem. A second mutation (V224I) identified in pigs at the neighboring amino acid residue is associated with an opposite effect, low glycogen and high pH, compared with the RN allele (14Ciobanu D. Bastiaansen J. Malek M. Helm J. Woollard J. Plastow G. Rothschild M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that γ3 is the predominant AMPK γ isoform in glycolytic (white, fast-twitch type II) muscle, whereas it is expressed at very low levels in oxidative (red, slow-twitch type I) muscle and is undetectable in brain, liver, or white adipose tissue (20Mahlapuu M.

Furthermore, γ3 primarily forms heterotrimers with α2 and β2 isoforms in glycolytic skeletal muscle. Here we report the characterization of the metabolic consequences of genetic modification of AMPK γ3 expression in skeletal muscle. Animal Care—Mice were maintained in a temperature- and light-controlled environment and were cared for in accordance with regulations for the protection of laboratory animals. The regional animal ethical committee approved all experimental procedures. Animals had free access to water and standard rodent chow. In some experiments, female mice were placed on either a standard chow or a high fat diet (21Zierath J.R. Houseknecht K. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from 4 to 16 weeks of age. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The complete coding sequence of mouse Prkag3 was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using skeletal muscle mRNA (Clontech). The forward (5′-CACCATGGAGCCCGAGCTGGAGCA) and reverse (5′-GTCTCAGGCGCTGAGGGCATC) primers included the translation start and stop codons (in bold), respectively. The forward primer also included a Kozak element (CACC, underlined above) (22Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) in front of the start codon to facilitate initiation of translation. The reverse transcriptase-PCR product (∼1.5 kb) was ligated into the pCRII TA TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). A clone with this consensus sequence (100% identity to Prkag3) was used for the transgene constructs. The R225Q mutation (13Milan D. Jeon J.T. Looft C. Amarger V. Thelander M. Robic A. Rogel-Gaillard C. Paul S. Iannuccelli N. Rask L. Ronne H. Lundström K. Reinsch N. Gellin J. Kalm E. Le Roy P. Chardon P. Andersson L. Science. 2000; 288: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) was introduced by in vitro mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) changing codon 225 from arginine to glutamine. EcoRI fragments containing the wild type or the mutant (225Q) form were ligated into the pMLC vector (23Gros L. Riu E. Montoliu L. Ontiveros M. Lebrigand L. Bosch F. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) along with flanking sequences for the myosin light chain 1 (MLC1) promoter and enhancer and the SV40 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1a). The constructs were cut from the plasmid and microinjected into mouse oocytes (CBA × C57Bl/6J). The founder mice were tested for transgenesis by PCR analysis using a forward primer in Prkag3 exon 12 (5′-GCTGCCCAGCAAACCTACAAC) and a reverse primer in SV40 3′-untranslated region. This amplicon spans the SV40 3′-untranslated region intron (66 bp) and thereby allowed for confirmation of the transgene both in genomic DNA (amplicon size = 453 bp) and in cDNA (amplicon size = 387 bp). Genomic DNA prepared from mouse tails was used for PCR. Generation of Knock-out Mice—Prkag3 knock-out mice were generated through traditional gene-targeting techniques. Briefly, exons 1–4 and exons 11–13 of Prkag3 were cloned into the pKOV923 selection plasmid (Stratagene) with a neomycin resistance (neor) gene inserted. The predicted result was a Prkag3 transcript with exons 1–4 joined with exons 11–13, including a frameshift after residue 211 and a premature stop codon at residue 235, skipping most of the 489 amino acids encoded by the wild type transcript (Fig. 1b). The construct was linearized using NotI and used for electroporation of embryonic stem cells. Knock-out recombinant embryonic stem cells were injected into blastocysts. Screening for knock-out recombinant embryonic stem cells was performed using Southern analysis, with SpeI digestions and a 1034-bp cDNA probe, representing the mitochondrial vitamin D (3Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) 25-hydroxylase (Cyp27) gene (Fig. 1b). The probe was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from mouse skeletal muscle mRNA. Long range PCR (MasterAmp high fidelity long PCR kit, Epicenter Technologies) was used to screen for knock-out recombinant embryonic stem cells and identification of heterozygous (Prkag3+/–) and homozygous (Prkag3–/–) carriers of the knock-out recombinant allele, respectively. Founder mice were back-crossed to C57Bl/6J mice for three generations. In all experiments, knock-out homozygote mice were compared with homozygous wild type littermates. Relative Quantification of mRNA—Quantification of mRNA representing different isoforms of AMPK γ subunits from adult mouse tissues was performed using reverse transcription and real time PCR. Relative quantities of mRNA were calculated for duplicate tissue samples from 1–2 mice and normalized for Actb (β-actin). Cell Culture and Transfections—Briefly, cDNA encoding the γ3 subunit of AMPK was inserted into cloning vector pDONR201 included in the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create γ3 V224I and γ3 R225Q cDNA constructs, which were cloned into Gateway cloning system pDEST26 (Invitrogen) for subsequent expression in mammalian cell culture. Cultured COS7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding α2, β2, and γ3 wild type, γ3 V224I, or γ3 R225Q. Post-transfection, cells were lysed, insoluble material was removed, and lysates were exposed to protein G-Sepharose-bound monoclonal antibody. After incubation, α2 containing immune complexes were harvested, washed, and halved for subsequent activity assays and immunoblotting. AMPK Activity Assay—AMPK activity was measured by phosphate incorporation of the ADR1 (222–234)Pro229 peptide substrate, LKKLTLRPSFSAQ (24Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Michelhill K.I. House C.M. Katsis F. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28445-28450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). AMPK immunocomplexes were assayed for 10 min, reactions were spotted on phosphocellulose paper (P81), and radioactivity was assessed by liquid scintillation analyzer. AMPK activities were calculated as pmol of phosphate incorporated into the ADR1 peptide/min in the presence of equal amounts of the heterotrimer. Western Blot Analysis—Quantitative analysis of the expression of different AMPK subunits was performed as described previously (20Mahlapuu M. Johansson C. Lindgren K. Hjälm G. Barnes B. Krook A. Zierath J. Andersson L. Marklund S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: E194-E200Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle protein lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and probed with primary AMPK isoform- or phospho-specific antibodies and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Glycogen and Triglyceride Analyses—Mice were studied under fed or fasted conditions or after swim exercise, as described previously (25Ryder J.W. Kawano Y. Galuska D. Fahlman R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Charron M.J. Zierath J.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2246-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fasted mice swam for four 30-min intervals separated by 5-min rest periods. After the last swim interval, mice were studied immediately or dried and returned to cages for 2.5 h (recovery). At the onset of the recovery period, mice received an intraperitoneal glucose injection (0.5 mg/g of body mass) and were subsequently given free access to chow and water. Gastrocnemius muscles were removed from anesthetized mice (Avertin; 2,2,2-tribromoethanol 99+% and tertiary amyl alcohol, 15 μl/g of body mass), cleaned of fat and blood, and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Glycogen content was determined fluorometrically on HCl extracts as described previously (26Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zetan N. Henriksson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7665-7671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triglyceride content was determined with a triglycerides/glycerol blanked kit (Roche Applied Science) using Seronorm™ lipid (SERO) as a standard. Glucose Tolerance Test—Glucose (2 g/kg of body mass) was administered to fasted mice by intraperitoneal injection. Blood samples were obtained via the tail vein prior to and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min following glucose injection for measurement of glucose concentration (One Touch Basic glucose meter; Lifescan). Skeletal Muscle Incubation Procedure—Incubation medium was prepared from a stock solution of Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (KHB) supplemented with 5 mmol/liter HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (RIA grade) and continuously gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Mice were anesthetized, and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were isolated and preincubated at 30 °C for 30 (glucose uptake) or 60 (for AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation) min in KHB containing 5 mmol/liter glucose and 15 mmol/liter mannitol in the absence or presence of insulin (12 nmol/liter) or AICAR (2 mmol/liter). Some muscles were subjected to 10 min of in vitro electrical stimulation, as described previously (27Ryder J.W. Fahlman R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Alessi D.R. Krook A. Zierath J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1457-1462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), before (glucose uptake) or during the final 10 min (for AMPK and ACC phosphorylation) of the incubation. Metabolic Assays—2-Deoxyglucose uptake was assessed in EDL muscles as described previously (26Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zetan N. Henriksson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7665-7671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results are expressed as μmol/ml of intracellular water/h (26Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zetan N. Henriksson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7665-7671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oleate oxidation was assessed in EDL muscles as described by Young et al. (28Young D.A. Ho R.S. Bell P.A. Cohen D.K. McIntosh R.H. Nadelson J. Foley J.E. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 1408-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Muscles were preincubated in the presence of insulin (60 nmol/liter) without or with AICAR (2 mmol/liter) for 20 min in KHB containing 5 mmol/liter HEPES, 3.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 10 mmol/liter glucose. Thereafter, muscles were incubated in 1 ml of identical medium containing 0.3 mmol/liter [1-14C]oleate (0.4 μCi/ml) for 60 min. The medium was acidified by 0.5 ml of 15% Δ′-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, and liberated CO2 was collected in center wells containing 0.2 ml of Protosol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 60 min. Center wells were removed for scintillation counting. Results were expressed as nmol of oxidized oleate/g of wet mass/h. Statistical Analyses—Differences between two groups were determined by an analysis of variance with multiple comparisons. Differences between more than two groups were determined by one-way analysis of variation followed by Fisher's least significant difference post hoc analysis. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Three novel mouse models were used to genetically dissect the functional role of the AMPK γ3 isoform in skeletal muscle. AMPK γ3-transgenic (Tg-Prkag3wt and Tg-Prkag3225Q) and Prkag3–/– mice had normal growth rates (data not shown). The expression of Prkag3 wild type (Tg-Prkag3wt) or an R225Q mutant form (Tg-Prkag3225Q) transgene was restricted to skeletal muscles containing a high proportion of glycolytic fibers, consistent with the expression profile of the endogenous Prkag3 transcript (Table I). We found a marked overexpression of the wild type transgene in EDL, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscle (∼16.5-, 6.6-, and 1.7-fold, respectively), but no or only a moderate overexpression of the mutant transgene (∼0.7-, 1.0-, and 1.8-fold, respectively). Positional effects or number of integrated copies most likely explain the difference in expression level between the two transgenic models. Levels of endogenous Prkag3 transcript in Tg-Prkag3225Q mice tended to be decreased.Table IRelative mRNA expression levels from endogenous Prkag1 and Prkag3 and transgenic Prkag3 in mice as measured by real time PCRTissueMouse linePrkag1 endogenousPrkag3EndogenousTransgenicLiverWTaWT, wild type.2.4 ± 0.90.0AMPK γ3wt1.70.00.0AMPK γ3225Q2.7 ± 1.30.00.0HeartWT22.9 ± 9.31.2 ± 0.4AMPK γ3wt12.50.10.0AMPK γ3225Q12.9 ± 10.90.3 ± 0.10.0Extensor digitorum longusbMuscle containing primarily glycolytic muscle fibers.WT19.9 ± 14.924.2 ± 3.0AMPK γ3wt23.3 ± 3.518.3 ± 4.21646 ± 492AMPK γ3225Q18.714.173.2GastrocnemiusbMuscle containing primarily glycolytic muscle fibers.WT30.9 ± 0.8100 ± 25.3AMPK γ3wt26.3 ± 8.562.1 ± 13.2659 ± 222AMPK γ3225Q19.4 ± 8.011.1 ± 2.499.5 ± 28.3AMPK γ3-/-9.53.8QuadricepsbMuscle containing primarily glycolytic muscle fibers.WT45.7 ± 3.141.3 ± 3.2AMPK γ3wt27.526.8167.2AMPK γ3225Q35.012.9182.8SoleuscMuscle containing primarily oxidative muscle fibers.WT33.4 ± 8.73.0 ± 0.8AMPK γ3wt30.8 ± 0.62.6 ± 0.811.1 ± 6.9AMPK γ3225Q28.7 ± 5.22.7 ± 0.56.5 ± 4.5DiaphragmcMuscle containing primarily oxidative muscle fibers.WT7.0 ± 4.01.3 ± 0.6AMPK γ3wt12.82.55.0AMPK γ3225Q10.3 ± 8.01.3 ± 0.80.9 ± 0.9BrainWT1.5 ± 0.00.0AMPK γ3wt2.2 ± 0.30.00.0AMPK γ3225Q1.70.00.0White adipose tissueWT1.3 ± 0.40.0AMPK γ3wt0.90.00.0AMPK γ3225Q1.20.00.0a WT, wild type.b Muscle containing primarily glycolytic muscle fibers.c Muscle containing primarily oxidative muscle fibers. Open table in a new tab The amount of expressed γ3 protein, as well as α, β, or the other γ subunits, was unchanged in Tg-Prkag3225Q mice (Fig. 2). Thus, AMPK expression in Tg-Prkag3225Q mice resembles the expression pattern in wild type mice, both in regard to tissue distribution and protein expression. The mutant form (225Q) presumably replaced endogenous γ3, based on the relative mRNA expression. However, endogenous and exogenous forms, as assessed by Western blot, were indistinguishable because they differed by a single amino acid substitution. An absolute quantification of the relative expression of the mutant and wild type protein is not crucial for the interpretation of our results because the R225Q mutation is fully dominant. Moreover, there is no significant difference in glycogen content between pigs expressing 50 or 100% of the mutant form. 2L. Andersson, unpublished observation. Overexpression of the wild type transgene led to an increase in the amount of γ3 protein and a concomitant increase in α1, α2, and β2 subunits (Fig. 2). Thus, the total amount of AMPK heterotrimers in glycolytic muscles was increased in Tg-Prkag3wt mice. Southern and Western blot analysis confirmed the successful disruption of Prkag3 and concomitant complete absence of γ3 expression in skeletal muscle in Prkag3 knock-out (Prkag3–/–) mice (Fig. 1, c and d). The homozygous knock-out animals were fully viable, and a standard pathological examination revealed no obvious phenotypic consequences of the γ3 disruption. Real time PCR analysis of mRNA from skeletal muscle expectedly revealed a low abundance of Prkag3 transcripts, as the PCR primers were designed against a part of the 3′-region that was not deleted by the gene-targeting event (Fig. 1b and Table I). The low abundance of this aberrant transcript likely reflects degradation by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (29Culbertson M.R. Leeds P.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis did not reveal any compensatory increase in γ1 and γ2 isoform expression in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2), indicating that these isoforms do not compete with γ3 for the same pool of α-β chains or do not form AMPK heterotrimers in the same cell or cellular compartment. Glycogen content in the glycolytic portion of the gastrocnemius muscle was 2-fold higher in Tg-Prkag3225Q mice compared with wild type mice under both fed and fasted conditions, whereas glycogen content was unaltered in Tg-Prkag3wt or Prkag3–/– mice (Fig. 3a). The results provide definitive evidence that R225Q is the causative mutation for the RN phenotype in pigs (13Milan D. Jeon J.T. Looft C. Amarger V. Thelander M. Robic A. Rogel-Gaillard C. Paul S. Iannuccelli N. Rask L. Ronne H. Lundström K. Reinsch N. Gellin J. Kalm E. Le Roy P. Chardon P. Andersson L. Science. 2000; 288: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) because the phenotype is replicated in mice by introducing this single missense mutation. Furthermore, this mutation alters the biochemical regulation of AMPK, as the increase in AMPK expression in the Tg-Prkag3wt mice failed to cause a glycogen phenotype. Glycogen content after swimming exercise was similar between wild type and all genetically modified mice (Fig. 3a). Thus, the R225Q mutation does not impair glycogen utilization during exercise. Because postexercise glycogen levels were appropriately depleted in Prkag3–/– mice, our data also suggests that AMPK γ3 is not required for glycogen degradation. Glycogen content 2.5 h after exercise was significantly higher in Tg-Prkag3225Q mice compared with wild type mice (Fig. 3a). A similar tendency (N. S) for increased glycogen content after exercise was also noted in Tg-Prkag3wt mice. In contrast, glycogen content was significantly lower in Prkag3–/–versus wild type mice 2.5 h after exercise, demonstrating that γ3 is important for glycogen resynthesis. Fasted insulin and glucose levels (data not shown) and glucose tolerance (Fig. 3b) were normal in transgenic and Prkag3–/– mice. Thus, despite a very distinct phenotype for skeletal muscle glycogen content, blood glucose homeostasis was normal in Tg-Prkag3225Q mice, consistent with the phenotype noted in pigs carrying the R225Q mutation. 3B. Essén-Gustavsson, M. Jensen-Waern, R. Jonasson, and L. Andersson, unpublished observation. AMPK phosphorylation under basal conditions or after activation with AICAR or contraction was similar between genotypes (Fig. 3c). Phosphorylation of the AMPK downstream target ACC was elevated under basal conditions and after AICAR stimulation in TgPrkag3225Q mice (Fig. 3d). This was unexpected because our transfection experiments (see below) revealed that the R225Q mutant γ3 isoform is AMP-independent and thus would be predicted to be AICAR-insensitive. However, the elevated ACC phosphorylation may be an indirect effect of the R225Q mutant γ3 isoform caused by an altered metabolic state of the cell. In fact, the γ3 isoform may not mediate ACC phosphorylation, consistent with unaltered ACC phosphorylation in Prkag3–/– mice (Fig. 3d). Glucose transport in isolated EDL muscle from fasted mice was determined in response to insulin, in response to AICAR, or after electrically stimulated contractions (Fig. 3e). Basal glucose transport was similar between genotypes. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport was normal in Tg-Prkag3wt and Prkag3–/– mice but was significantly reduced in Tg-Prkag3225Q mice. The reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose transport was not observed in fed mice (data not shown). AICAR-induced glucose transport was normal in Tg-Prkag3wt, but significantly reduced (∼50%) in Tg-Prkag3225Q, compared with wild type fasted (Fig. 3e) and fed (data not shown) mice. Thus, the mutation in γ3 may occur at a site that is directly involved with the interaction with both AMP and AICAR, rendering a mutant form that is partially resistant to AICAR. This interpretation is supported by evidence that this region of the γ subunit directly binds AMP and that the presence of this mutation at the corresponding site in the γ1 (R70Q) or γ2 (R302Q) subunit impairs AMP and ATP binding (30Scott J.W.

Van Denderen B.J. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Witters L.A. Stapleton D. Kemp B.E. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude a partial inhibition because of excessive glycogen content (32Wojtaszewski J.F. Jorgensen S.B. Hellsten Y. Hardie D.G. Richter E.A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 33Wojtaszewski J.F. MacDonald C. Nielsen J.N. Hellsten Y. Hardie D.G. Kemp B.E. Kiens B. Richter E.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 284: E813-E822Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the AICAR effect on glucose uptake in EDL muscle was completely abolished in Prkag3–/– mice (Fig. 3e). Thus, AMPK complexes containing the γ3 subunit are required for AICAR-induced glucose transport in skeletal muscle, and other γ isoforms fail to compensate for the loss of γ3 function. This result is consistent with the reduced glycogen resynthesis in vivo after exercise in Prkag3–/– mice (Fig. 3a). In contrast to the results for AICAR, in vitro contraction of isolated EDL muscle led to a similar increase in glucose uptake in all genotypes in fasted (Fig. 3e) or fed mice (data not shown). Similarly, AICAR- but not contraction-induced glucose uptake was abolished in AMPK α2, but not in α1 knock-out mice (34Jorgensen S.B. Viollet B. Andreeli F. Frosig C. Birk J.B. Schjerling P. Vaulont S. Richter E.A. Wojtaszewski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1070-1079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Because the γ3 subunit primarily forms heterotrimers with α2 (20Mahlapuu M. Johansson C. Lindgren K. Hjälm G. Barnes B. Krook A. Zierath J. Andersson L. Marklund S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: E194-E200Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), disruption of either α2 or γ3 should confer a similar glucose transport defect in skeletal muscle. AICAR-induced glucose uptake was also abolished in kinase-dead AMPK α2-transgenic mice (35Mu J. Brozinick J.T.J. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In contrast to the α2 AMPK knock-out and the Prkag3–/– mice, contraction-mediated glucose transport was significantly blunted (30%) in kinase-dead AMPK α2-transgenic mice, possibly because of contraction-induced hypoxia, as these mice have an impaired hypoxia response. Collectively, these results challenge the hypothesis that contraction increases glucose transport through an AMPK-mediated mechanism. In contrast, activation of AMPK is directly linked to AICAR-stimulated glucose transport. Although AICAR and contraction both increase AMPK activity, the AMPK response to in vitro contraction may be inconsequential for activation of glucose transport. Although γ3-containing AMPK complexes are required for AICAR-mediated glucose uptake, they appear to be dispensable for AICAR-mediated fatty acid oxidation in chow-fed mice. AICAR-mediated fatty acid oxidation was similar between genotypes (Fig. 3f), consistent with the observed normal level of ACC phosphorylation in the Prkag3–/– mice (Fig. 3d). AMPK has been identified as a molecular target for pharmacological intervention to treat insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus. However, genetic validation of this target is lacking. We challenged wild type, Tg-Prkag3225Q, and Prkag3–/– mice with a high fat diet for 12 weeks and evaluated metabolic responses. Muscle glycogen content was unaffected by the high fat diet (data not shown). However, triglyceride content was increased (Fig. 4b), and insulin action on glucose transport was impaired in wild type and Prkag3–/– mice (Fig. 4, c and d). In contrast, Tg-Prkag3225Q mice were protected against triglyceride accumulation (Fig. 4b) and insulin resistance (Fig. 4c), presumably because of increased fat oxidation (Fig. 4a) in skeletal muscle. This phenotype closely resembles the original phenotype described for mutant pigs (13Milan D. Jeon J.T. Looft C. Amarger V. Thelander M. Robic A. Rogel-Gaillard C. Paul S. Iannuccelli N. Rask L. Ronne H. Lundström K. Reinsch N. Gellin J. Kalm E. Le Roy P. Chardon P. Andersson L. Science. 2000; 288: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The high frequency of the RN– mutation (PRKAG3225Q) in Hampshire pigs was likely caused by the strong selection for lean meat content in commercial pig populations, as pigs carrying this mutation are leaner (more muscle, less fat) than wild type pigs. Mutant pigs also have a higher oxidative capacity, as measured by an increase in activity of citrate synthase and β-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (36Estrade M. Ayoub S. Talmant A. Monin G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1994; 108: 295-301Google Scholar, 37Lebret B. Le Roy P. Monin G. Lefaucheur L. Caritez J.C. Talmant A. Elsen J. Sellier P. J. Anim. Sci. 1999; 77: 1482-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The relationship between the R225Q mutation and increased oxidative capacity in both mutant pigs and transgenic mice prompted us to investigate whether this was associated with an altered muscle fiber type composition. Real time PCR analysis of Atp1b1 and Atpb2 (20Mahlapuu M. Johansson C. Lindgren K. Hjälm G. Barnes B. Krook A. Zierath J. Andersson L. Marklund S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: E194-E200Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), markers of glycolytic and oxidative skeletal muscle fibers (38Hundal H.S. Marette A. Ramlal T. Liu Z. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), revealed a similar ratio of Atp1b1 and Atpb2 expression in gastrocnemius and EDL muscle from Tg-Prkag3225Q and Prkag3–/– mice (data not shown). Furthermore, myoglobin protein expression in Tg-Prkag3225Q and Prkag3–/– did not differ from wild type mice (data not shown). Thus, R225Q alters skeletal muscle oxidative capacity without altering fiber type composition. AMPK activity and phosphorylation of Thr172 were determined in COS cells transfected with AMPK trimers containing α2, β2, and either wild type γ3 or mutant γ3 (R225Q or V224I). AMPK activity and phosphorylation on Thr172 in the absence of AMP were elevated in cells transfected with α2-β2-γ3 R225Q and unchanged in cells transfected with α2-β2-γ3 V224I. Both mutations resulted in diminished AMP dependence on AMPK (Fig. 5). The ranking of basal AMPK activity in the three genotypes is consistent with the in vivo effects of the corresponding pig mutations, as the R225Q and V224I mutants are associated with increased and decreased muscle glycogen content, respectively (13Milan D. Jeon J.T. Looft C. Amarger V. Thelander M. Robic A. Rogel-Gaillard C. Paul S. Iannuccelli N. Rask L. Ronne H. Lundström K. Reinsch N. Gellin J. Kalm E. Le Roy P. Chardon P. Andersson L.

Genetics. 2001; 159: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We provide definitive evidence that PRKAG3 R225Q is the causative mutation for the elevated glycogen content in skeletal muscle from RN pigs. Tg-Prkag3225Q mice have elevated glycogen levels and have increased glycogen resynthesis after exercise. Our in vitro studies reveal that AMPK complexes containing the R225Q γ3 subunit have a higher basal AMPK activity and lack AMP dependence. Thus, R225Q can be considered a loss-of-function mutation that abolishes allosteric regulation by AMP/ATP, causing increased basal AMPK activity."
https://openalex.org/W2031843850,"This study provides new insights into neuroprotection involving interaction of protein kinase C (PKC) pathway with Bcl-2 family proteins. Using a model of serum deprivation, we investigated the mechanism by which the anti-Parkinson/monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor drug, rasagiline, exerts its neuroprotective effect in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Here, we report that rasagiline (0.1-10 microM) decreased apoptosis via multiple protection mechanisms, including the stimulation of PKC phosphorylation; up-regulation of PKCalpha and PKC mRNAs, induction of Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNAs; and down-regulation of Bad and Bax mRNAs. Moreover, rasagiline inhibited the cleavage and activation of procaspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), whereas the PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, reversed these actions. Similarly, rasagiline decreased serum-free-induced levels of the important regulator of cell death, Bad, which was also blocked by GF109203X, indicating the involvement of PKC in rasagiline-induced cell survival. Furthermore, these studies have established that PKC- and Bcl-2-dependent neuroprotective activity of rasagiline is dependent on its propargyl moiety, because propargylamine had similar effects with the same potency."
https://openalex.org/W2160209413,"Exposure of endothelial cells to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) on site Tyr407, an effect that required the association of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) with HSP90. The association of VEGFR2 with HSP90 involved the last 130 amino acids of VEGFR2 and was blocked by geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of HSP90. Moreover, geldanamycin inhibited the VEGF-induced activation of the small GTPase RhoA, which resulted in an inhibition of phosphorylation of FAK on site Tyr407. In this context, the inhibition of RhoA kinase (ROCK) with Y27632 or by expression of dominant negative forms of RhoA or ROCK impaired the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Tyr407 within FAK. In contrast to phosphorylation of Tyr861, the phosphorylation of site Tyr407 was insensitive to Src kinase inhibition by 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine (PP2). We also found that the recruitment of paxillin to FAK was inhibited by geldanamycin but not by PP2, whereas both geldanamycin and PP2 inhibited the recruitment of vinculin to FAK. In accordance, the recruitment of paxillin and vinculin to FAK was inhibited in cells that express the mutant FAK-Y407F, whereas the expression of the mutant Y861F inhibited the recruitment of paxillin but not of vinculin. Importantly, cell migration was abolished in cells in which the signal from the VEGFR2-HSP90 pathway was blocked by the expression of Δ130VEGFR2, a deletant of VEGFR2 that does not associate with HSP90. Our findings underscore for the first time the key role played by the VEGFR2-HSP90-RhoA-ROCK-FAK/Tyr407 pathway in transducing the VEGF signal that leads to the assembly of focal adhesions and endothelial cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2009324889,"A hallmark of signal transduction is the dynamic and inducible post-translational modification of proteins. In addition to the well characterized phosphorylation of proteins, other modifications have been shown to be regulatory, including O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc).

Although there are only 21, counting selenocysteine, genomically encoded mammalian amino acids, post-translational modification results in proteins that contain more than 50 different amino acids (1Parekh R.B. Rohlff C. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, covalent modification of polypeptides plays a major role in the generation of functional polypeptides and adds an extra level of complexity in attempts to understand the proteome (2Tyers M.

While several protein modifications are static, a subset of post-translational modifications is both dynamic and inducible. It is the study of these “regulatory” post-translational modifications and the enzymes that add and subtract them to proteins that comprises a significant portion of the signal transduction field (3Graves J.D.

Accordingly, a significant body of literature has focused on the kinase superfamily, which makes up more than 2% of the proteins encoded by the human genome (4Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. Li P.W. Mural R.J. Sutton G.G. Smith H.O. Yandell M. Evans C.A. Holt R.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P. Ballew R.M. Huson D.H. Wortman J.R. Zhang Q. Kodira C.D. Zheng X.H. Chen L. Skupski M. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10770) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in humans there appear to be only about 15 catalytic serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PPP subfamily) compared with literally hundreds of serine/threonine kinases (4Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. Li P.W. Mural R.J. Sutton G.G. Smith H.O. Yandell M. Evans C.A. Holt R.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P. Ballew R.M. Huson D.H. Wortman J.R. Zhang Q. Kodira C.D. Zheng X.H. Chen L. Skupski M. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10770) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding how protein dephosphorylation is regulated has been an area of intense study for the last two decades (5Cohen P. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1990; 24: 230-235PubMed Google Scholar, 6Aggen J.B. Nairn A.C. Chamberlin R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R13-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). One emerging theme is that the catalytic phosphatases have binding partners that regulate their localization and activity (7Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to phosphorylation, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of nuclear and cytosolic proteins is an abundant, dynamic, and inducible post-translational modification (8Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 9Hanover J.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1865-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 10Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, unlike kinases, there appears to be only one O-GlcNAc transferase catalytic subunit (OGT, 1The abbreviations used are: OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc to proteins) in mammals (11Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Similar to phosphatases, it has been proposed that OGT is regulated by a multitude of binding partners as well as post-translational modification and alternative splicing (12Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 13Hanover J.A. Yu S. Lubas W.B. Shin S.H. Ragano-Caracciola M. Kochran J. Love D.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated recently that OGT interacts with several proteins that appear to target it to different locations inside the cell (14Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Iyer S.P. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24608-24616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16Yang X. Zhang F. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Serine/threonine phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc modification are mutually exclusive at a given residue. Interestingly, several site-mapping studies have established the same site on a protein as being phosphorylated and O-GlcNAc-modified (for review, see Ref. 17Vosseller K. Sakabe K. Wells L. Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This suggested that there might be a reciprocal, competitive relationship between these two dynamic modifications. Subsequent studies established that in fact this yin-yang relationship does exist both at the global level as well as at specific sites on several proteins (for review, see Ref. 18Comer F.I. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7845-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, at a given serine/threonine residue in a protein, the amino acid could be unmodified, phosphorylated, or O-GlcNAc-modified. To further increase complexity, serine/threonine sulfation has been demonstrated recently as well (19Medzihradszky K.F. Darula Z. Perlson E. Fainzilber M. Chalkley R.J. Ball H. Greenbaum D. Bogyo M. Tyson D.R. Bradshaw R.A. Burlingame A.L. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 429-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here, in further support of the yin-yang model, we demonstrate that OGT and phosphatases copurify with one another. Using a two-step purification, we are able to isolate a relatively pure complex that contains both OGT and serine/threonine phosphatases. Western blot analysis identifies the predominant copurifying phosphatases as PP1β and PP1γ. Finally, we demonstrate that this complex is active in converting a phosphorylated substrate to an O-GlcNAc-modified product. Preparation of Rat Brain Extract—Extracts were prepared by polytron lysis of frozen rat brain (7 ml/g; Pel-Freeze) in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor O-(2-acetaminido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamamate (PUGNAc; Ref. 20Haltiwanger R.S. Grove K. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3611-3617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), 500 μm MnCl2, 250 μm EDTA, 200 μm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. After lysis, the suspension was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant was filtered through a 1-μm glass fiber filter and used immediately or frozen at –80 °C. Microcystin-Sepharose Chromatography—Purification of phosphatases and associated proteins by microcystin-Sepharose chromatography (Upstate Biotechnology) was performed as described previously starting with 75 mg of rat brain extract (21Moorhead G. MacKintosh R.W. Morrice N. Gallagher T. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For experiments to try to prevent OGT binding, after extensive washing, microcystin-Sepharose beads were split equally and incubated with or without a synthetic peptide (0.5 mm final concentration) from rat OGT corresponding to residues 885–896 (LPQNRIIFSPVA) for 30 min at 4 °C. The peptide was synthesized by standard FMOC (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, purified by reverse-phase HPLC, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. Immunopurification, Western Blot, and Gel Analysis—The general serine/threonine phosphatase antibody (FL-18) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies to OGT, PP1α, PP1β, PP1γ, PP4, and PP6 have been described previously (12Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Immunopurified proteins from rat brain extract (75 mg) were washed four times with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate in Tris-buffered saline and were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were silver-stained as described previously (28Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) or transferred to membranes and Western blotted as described previously (12Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). For the two-step purification of the “yin-yang” complex, 250 mg of rat brain extract was immunoprecipitated, after preclearing, with the OGT antibody, and bound proteins were eluted with 4.5 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, into 0.5 ml of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. The resulting eluted proteins were purified as described above with microcystin or the general phosphatase antibody. In-gel Digest, LC-MS/MS Analysis, and Protein Identification—Ingel digest was performed on silver-stained gels as described previously (29Wells L. Vosseller K. Cole R.N. Cronshaw J.M. Matunis M.J. Hart G.W. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were separated by capillary reverse-phase HPLC, using a 45-min linear gradient of methanol in 1% acetic acid, directly into the tandem mass spectrometer (LCQ, ThermoFinnigan). Fragmentation data were collected in an automated fashion with a dynamic exclusion of 3. Data analysis was performed using TurboSequest (30MacCoss M.J. Wu C.C. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5593-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and a minimum of three peptides with Xcorr > 2.5 was required for protein identification. Phosphatase Activity—Phosphatase activity was measured from immunoprecipitates (from 75 mg of rat brain extract) by the release of radioactive inorganic phosphate from in vitro protein kinase A-labeled myelin basic protein following the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs) in the presence or absence of (i) 50 nm okadaic acid (Calbiochem), (ii) 5 mm EDTA, or (iii) 1 mm CaCl2. Phosphatase activity was normalized so that OGT-associated activity in the absence of inhibitor was 100%. A representative experiment is shown (Fig. 1C); although some variability was seen from experiment to experiment in total counts released, once normalized, the relative ratio between preimmune and OGT immunoprecipitates was constant (less than 10% variability). OGT Activity—OGT activity was measured for immunoprecipitates from 75 mg of rat brain extract by the radioactive addition of GlcNAc to a synthetic unmodified or phosphorylated peptide (PGGSTPVS(PO3)-SANMM) essentially as described previously (31Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Incubation time was 2 h in the absence of UDP-GlcNAc followed by its addition and another 4 h of incubation. OGT activity was corrected against preimmune generated counts and normalized to 100% for the glycosylation of the unmodified peptide. A representative experiment is shown (Fig. 3B); although significant variability was seen from experiment to experiment in total counts incorporated, once normalized, the relative ratios between experimental samples remained fairly constant (less than 18% variability). Microcystin-Sepharose chromatography has been used to purify multiple serine/threonine phosphatases and their binding partners (21Moorhead G. MacKintosh R.W. Morrice N. Gallagher T. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 32Runnegar M. Berndt N. Kong S.M. Lee E.Y. Zhang L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 33Gulledgea B.M. Aggena J.B. Huangb H.B. Nairnc A.C. Chamberlin A.R. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 1991-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Following preclearing of rat brain extract over Sepharose 4B, OGT is retained on a microcystin-Sepharose column after extensive washing (Fig. 1A). To further demonstrate the specificity of this interaction, a general serine/threonine phosphatase antibody was used to immunoprecipitate proteins from precleared rat brain lysates. This antibody, although generated against PP1α, is known to cross-react with most family members of the PP1, PP2A, and PP2B phosphatases as well as PP4. Lysates were also immunoprecipitated with an antibody to OGT as a positive control. Following SDS-PAGE separation of the proteins, OGT was detected as co-immunopurifying with the phosphatases by Western blot (Fig. 1A). Thus, using two independent methods, we were able to demonstrate that OGT copurifies with serine/threonine phosphatases. We next wanted to determine whether phosphatases would co-immunoprecipitate with OGT. Rat brain lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody to OGT, with a prebleed as a negative control, or with the general phosphatase antibody as a positive control. A serine/threonine phosphatase was detected as co-immunopurifying with OGT by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). To further confirm the presence of a copurifying phosphatase, OGT immunoprecipitates were used to dephosphorylate protein kinase A-phosphorylated myelin basic protein. The phosphatase activity in the OGT immunoprecipitates was found to be sensitive to okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A phosphatases at 50 nm (Fig. 1C). However, phosphatase activity was not abolished at 5 nm okadaic acid (data not shown), suggesting that the more sensitive PP2A was not responsible for the observed phosphatase activity (34Dounay A.B. Forsyth C.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 1939-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To test for the presence of PP2B activity, phosphatase activity assays were conducted in the presence of divalent cations or EDTA, and no effect was seen on activity (data not shown). This suggests that the phosphatase co-immunopurifying with OGT is not PP2B, which has a divalent cation requirement for activity (35Cohen P.T. Brewis N.D. Hughes V. Mann D.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activity was inhibited by free microcystin (data not shown), and OGT purified with phosphatases upon microcystin chromatography (Fig. 1A) suggesting that the activity was not due to the microcystin-insensitive phosphatase PP2C (data not shown) (36Bork P. Brown N.P. Hegyi H. Schultz J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We next wanted to establish the identity of the phosphatase that was in complex with OGT. As a first approach, we took rat brain extract and immunoprecipitated the complex with an antibody to OGT. The resulting proteins were further purified by either microcystin-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 2) or immunoprecipitation with the general phosphatase antibody (data not shown). Either procedure gave virtually identical protein banding patterns upon SDS-PAGE separation and silver staining. The presence of OGT and the presence of the phosphatase were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). Silver-stained bands were subjected to in-gel digest with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by capillary LC-MS/MS. Positive identifications (greater than three sequenced tryptic peptides) were made for OGT, both the heavy and light chain of the antibody, and for α-actin migrating around 45 kDa (data not shown). Unfortunately the band that represented the serine/threonine phosphatase, as identified by Western blot, was refractory to identification. Whether actin is truly in the complex or is contamination because of its overwhelming abundance in the extract is unclear. What is clear from this experiment is that OGT and a serine/threonine phosphatase, along with actin, are the predominant proteins in this complex. As an alternative approach to identifying the phosphatase, we conducted a host of Western blots on OGT and control immunoprecipitates from rat brain extracts. Phosphatases tested for copurifying with OGT were PP1α, PP1β, PP1γ, PP4, and PP6. Only PP1β and PP1γ copurified specifically with OGT (Fig. 3A). A binding motif, Arg/Lys-Val/Ile-Xaa-Phe (where Xaa is any amino acid), has been described previously for proteins that interact with the catalytic subunits of PP1 (37Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). OGT contains such a motif beginning at amino acid 889 in the rat sequence Arg-Ile-Ile-Phe. This suggests that OGT may be directly binding PP1β and PP1γ in the yin-yang complex. However, it should be noted that a synthetic peptide of OGT spanning the binding domain at a high concentration (0.5 mm) only had a minor effect on preventing OGT from copurifying with phosphatases by microcystin-Sepharose chromatography (data not shown). Thus, either the complex is difficult to disrupt once formed, or OGT is not using the consensus motif for binding in the yin-yang complexes. Finally, we demonstrated that OGT immunoprecipitates are capable of dephosphorylating and O-GlcNAc-modifying a synthetic peptide that has been phosphorylated at the known position for O-GlcNAc modification (Fig. 3B) (31Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptide used in this study is identical to the unmodified peptide except that it is phosphorylated at the known acceptor site for O-GlcNAc modification (31Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that O-GlcNAc modification of the phosphorylated peptide requires okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase activity (Fig. 3B). In the presence of okadaic acid, OGT is incapable of modifying the phosphopeptide but modifies the naked peptide equally well in the presence or absence of okadaic acid (Fig. 3B). This demonstrates that the OGT immunoprecipitates contain an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase activity that must first dephosphorylate the substrate before OGT can catalyze the addition of O-GlcNAc. Thus, the yin-yang complex is functional in the dephosphorylation and subsequent O-GlcNAc modification of a phosphorylated substrate. Even though rat PP1β, PP1γ, and PP1α are greater than 85% identical at the amino acid level, OGT fails to copurify with PP1α from rat brain extract (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, PP1β and PP1γ have been shown to be enriched in cytoskeletal fractions of cells (38Colbran R.J. Bass M.A. McNeill R.B. Bollen M. Zhao S. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). While PP1γ appears to be the isoform mainly associated with the actin cytoskeleton, the PP1β isoform is found predominantly associated with microtubules (39Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F.F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The association between PP1γ and OGT or the fact that PP1β is known to associate with the actin motor myosin (40Moorhead G. Johnson D. Morrice N. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) may explain why actin was seen to copurify in the isolation of the yin-yang complex (Fig. 2). Several microtubule-associated proteins, including the Alzheimer's related protein tau (41Arnold C.S. Johnson G.V. Cole R.N. Dong D.L. Lee M. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28741-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), are O-GlcNAc-modified (42Wells L. Whalen S.A. Hart G.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A reciprocal relationship has been established between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc modification on the tau protein (43Lefebvre T. Ferreira S. Dupont-Wallois L. Bussiere T. Dupire M.J. Delacourte A. Michalski J.C. Caillet-Boudin M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hyperphosphorylated, hypoglycosylated tau is associated with the neurofibrillary tangles observed in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies (for review, see Ref. 44Avila J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This suggests a working model in which the yin-yang complex serves to dephosphorylate and O-GlcNAc-modify tau in neurons. Several studies have shown a decline in brain glucose metabolism of Alzheimer's patients compared with age-matched controls (45Alexander G.E. Chen K. Pietrini P. Rapoport S.I. Reiman E.M. Am. J. Psychiatry. 2002; 159: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 46Ibanez V. Pietrini P. Alexander G.E. Furey M.L. Teichberg D. Rajapakse J.C. Rapoport S.I. Schapiro M.B. Horwitz B. Neurology. 1998; 50: 1585-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that glucose utilization declines with age in neurons (47Hoyer S. Arch. Gerontol. Geriatr. 1985; 4: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that the level of the donor substrate for O-GlcNAc addition, UDP-GlcNAc, is proportional to the levels of glucose in the cell. In addition, PP1β expression levels have been shown to be decreased in the neurons of Alzheimer's disease patients (48Mufson E.J. Counts S.E. Ginsberg S.D. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1035-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Taken together these data further expand the model to predict that O-GlcNAc modification prevents hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau and that the development of tauopathies may result from lowered levels of O-GlcNAc on tau. These lowered levels of O-GlcNAc on tau may result from reduced levels of activity of the yin-yang complex caused by transcriptional repression of PP1β and lowered donor sugar nucleotide levels for OGT. We are currently in the process of testing this attractive model. PP1β is also the major PP1 isoform observed in insulin-responsive peripheral tissues and is targeted to glycogen (49Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 157-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 50Barker H.M. Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Spurr N.K. Cohen P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We and others have recently established that increased O-GlcNAc levels induce insulin resistance, the hallmark of type II diabetes (51Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 52McClain D.A. Lubas W.A. Cooksey R.C. Hazel M. Parker G.J. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10695-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Furthermore, McClain and co-workers (53Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10022-10027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that glycogen synthase is O-GlcNAc-modified. Interestingly, N-acetylglucosamine analogues have been shown to inhibit glycogen-bound PP1 (54Board M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In adipocytes, a combination of glucose flux into the production of UDP-GlcNAc and chronic insulin treatment leads to maximal increases in the O-GlcNAc post-translational modification (51Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Likewise, the insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of metabolic enzymes that regulates glycogen and lipid metabolism is performed by PP1 isoforms (49Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 157-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, both O-GlcNAc modification and PP1 activity appear to be insulin-responsive and in turn to modulate insulin signal transduction. The yin-yang complex ties these two activities together and may offer insight into the mechanism of hyperglycemia- and hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance in type II diabetes. The identification here of the yin-yang complex provides further evidence for the reciprocal relationship observed between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc modification (55Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Identification of the complex suggests one possible mechanism for this dynamic relationship on certain proteins. We are currently pursuing the possible existence of a yang-yin complex that would contain a serine/threonine kinase associated with O-GlcNAcase, the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc from protein (56Gao Y. Wells L. Comer F.I. Parker G.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 57Wells L. Gao Y. Mahoney J.A. Vosseller K. Chen C. Rosen A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1755-1761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Perhaps most importantly, the identification of the OGT-PP1β and OGT-PP1γ complexes suggests testable working models for the combined role of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc modification in the development of neurofibrillary plaques in Alzheimer's disease and insulin resistance in type II diabetes. We thank members of the Hart and Wadzinski laboratories for helpful discussions and assistance."

These show a strong structural homology to two conformational states of another eukaryotic ATP-binding cassette transporter, P-glycoprotein. In contrast to P-glycoprotein, however, both conformational states can be observed in the presence of a nucleotide, which may be related to the role of CFTR as an ion channel rather than a transporter. The hypothesis that the two conformations could represent the “open” and “closed” states of the channel is considered.

(product of the gene mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis) is a novel member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily that functions as an ion channel rather than a membrane transporter as most other members do (1Hanrahan J.W.

This chloride channel activity plays an important role in both secretion and reabsorption of ions and fluid at epithelial surfaces (2Frizzell R.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). More than 1000 different mutations in the CFTR gene have been identified in cystic fibrosis patients. Many of these impair different properties of the ion channel and its regulation, but the most common mutation, ΔF508, results in misfolding and the failure of maturation (3Gelman M.S. Kopito R.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological and biochemical studies of wild-type and different mutant CFTRs have shed considerable light on its mechanism of action (1Hanrahan J.W. Gentzsch M. Riordan J.R. Holland B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins from Bacteria to Man. Academic Press Ltd., London2002: 589-618Google Scholar). The overall control of channel activity is exerted by the phosphorylation by protein kinase A of the central regulatory domain, which enables the control of gating by ATP interactions with the two dissimilar nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Stable binding of ATP to NBD1 where little or no hydrolysis occurs together with binding and formation of the transition state for hydrolysis at NBD2 opens the channel (4Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.B.

Aleksandrov L. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Allosteric interactions between the regulatory domain, the NBDs, and the channel-forming portions of the protein are likely to underlie this sequence of events. However, before further insight can be gained into this mechanism, knowledge of the three-dimensional structure is required.Among eukaryotic ABC proteins in which all domains are contained within a single polypeptide, low resolution structures have been determined for P-glycoprotein (7Rosenberg M.F.

Electron crystallography of P-glycoprotein has enabled the visualization of the major shape changes of the transmembrane domains (TMDs) as a consequence of nucleotide binding to the NBDs. High resolution structures by x-ray diffraction have not yet been determined for these or other whole eukaryotic ABC proteins but they have in the cases of two bacterial multisubunit transporters (11Chang G.

Electron crystallography, yielding three-dimensional structural information to a resolution of ∼2 nm indicates that the crystallized CFTR is monomeric, has overall structural similarities to P-glycoprotein, and can assume two different conformational states possibly reflecting differential nucleotide binding to the two NBDs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification, Nucleotide Binding, and Hydrolysis—Baby hamster kidney-21 cells expressing C terminally deca-histidine-tagged wild-type human CFTR were grown to confluence in roller bottles (850-cm2 surface area) in 100 bottle lots yielding ∼1010 cells. Cells were washed, disrupted, and fractionated by conventional differential centrifugation steps (21Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors to obtain a crude microsomal membrane preparation containing most of the CFTR protein. Peripherally associated proteins were removed from the membranes by a brief incubation at pH 10.8 on ice (22Steck T.L. Yu J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1973; 1: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Solubilization of integral proteins was achieved with 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2 containing 0.2% lipids (Escherichia coli crude lipids/phosphatidylcholine, 3:1), and 20% glycerol. The supernatant, after centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g, was mixed gently with Ni-NTA beads in the presence of 5 mm imidazole at 4 °C. After washing extensively with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1% DDM, and 60 mm imidazole, His-tagged CFTR was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 400 mm. The eluate was mixed gently with wheat germ lectin-agarose beads to enable the binding of the mature CFTR protein with exposed N-acetylglucosamine-containing binding sites for the lectin in the complex oligosaccharide chains. These beads were washed extensively with the same buffer but with reduction of the DDM concentration to 0.1% and addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol and a lipid mixture (phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine/cholesterol, 5:3:1:1) to provide a lipid:protein ratio of ∼100:1 on elution, which was with the same solution but also containing 0.5 mN-acetylglucosamine and 50% ethylene glycol. Finally the purified protein was reconstituted by dialysis (10-kDa cut-off membrane) for 48 h at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 and adjusted to 10% glycerol.The binding of AMP-PNP to CFTR in the same membranes used for its purification was assessed using the photoactive analogue, [α-32P]8-N3AMP-PNP (5Aleksandrov L.

Radioactivity associated with specifically immunoprecipitated tryptic fragments containing either NBD1 or NBD2 of CFTR was determined by electronic autoradiography as described previously (23Aleksandrov L.

The response of single CFTR chloride channels to AMP-PNP in the presence and absence of ATP was measured in planar lipid bilayers employing exactly the same procedures we have described elsewhere (24Aleksandrov A.A. Riordan J.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).ATPase activity of purified and reconstituted CFTR was assayed in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Na2ATP, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. Nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography and the [α-32P]ADP formed quantified by electronic autoradiography (Packard Instant Imager).Crystallization and Electron Crystallography—Crystallization of CFTR used a method similar to that described for P-glycoprotein (8Rosenberg M.F.

Briefly, purified CFTR (0.1 mg/ml, 5 μg) was added to a crystallization buffer (11.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 110 mm ammonium sulfate, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml dodecylmaltoside, and 5 mm AMP-PNP). The protein solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s and incubated (2-5 μl) on a silanized glass slide against a reservoir containing 1.0 m MgCl2 sealed with vacuum grease at 4 °C. After ∼20 h, the two-dimensional crystals were transferred to a glow-discharged (30 s in the presence of air) copper grid (400 mesh) coated with a continuous carbon film. These were immediately negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl-acetate and viewed under the electron microscope. Untilted and tilted images were recorded under low dose conditions using Tecnai 10 and Philips CM100 transmission electron microscopes. Negatives were developed using full-strength D19 developer. Multilayered crystals were selected against by adjusting the protein concentration (25Scarborough G.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 643-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cyrklaff M.

Images were processed as described previously using the Medical Research Council crystallographic program suite (9Rosenberg M.F. Kamis A.B. Callaghan R. Higgins C.F. Ford R.C. J. Biol.

Membranes from these cells contain a larger amount of functional CFTR than other stable mammalian cells, for example ∼5× more than in Chinese hamster ovary cells (16O'Riordan C.R. Erickson A. Bear C.

Hou Y.X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of each step in the purification protocol is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Substantial amounts of peripheral membrane proteins were removed from the membranes by alkaline pH treatment without a significant loss of CFTR. The remaining integral proteins including CFTR were solubilized in 1% DDM. Nearly all of the CFTR was bound to and eluted from the Ni-NTA matrix resulting in a high degree of purification. A subsequent WGA-agarose affinity step removed most remaining contaminating bands.To determine whether the detergent-soluble purified protein was active, its ability to hydrolyze ATP was assayed. There was a linear relationship between the rate of hydrolysis and the amount of purified protein (Fig. 2A), and Michaelis-Menten behavior was exhibited with a Km in the millimolar range with either ATP or GTP as the substrate (Fig. 2B). This low specificity among purine nucleoside triphosphates is common with other ABC proteins (32Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol.

Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because of its high affinity binding and locking of the CFTR channel, we reasoned that the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide might be a good ligand to employ in attempts to crystallize the protein, perhaps restricting its flexibility. Moreover, AMP-PNP has been employed successfully to increase the yield of two-dimensional crystals of another ABC protein, P-glycoprotein (8Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G.

AMP-PNP was found to greatly prolong the open state of the channel when it was present with ATP, and it is capable of opening the channel itself when present at high concentrations (4Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.B. Aleksandrov L. Riordan J.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 528: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both of these effects are demonstrated in Fig. 3 using the CFTR present in membranes used for its purification. It is not known if these effects at different concentrations correspond to binding of AMPPNP to different NBDs. However, N3AMP-PNP binds with a much higher affinity to NBD1 than NBD2, whereas N3ATP interacts with a similar affinity to both domains (23Aleksandrov L. Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. J.

Fig. 4 illustrates that N3AMP-PNP binds to NBD1 with a Kd of ∼10 μm.As described below, two-dimensional crystalline arrays were obtained in the presence of 5 mm AMP-PNP, i.e. at a concentration where we might expect the NBD1 binding site to be saturated and the NBD2 site to be at least partially occupied (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Influence of AMP-PNP on CFTR channel gating.

An initial assessment suggested that the crystalline order was high with strong peaks in the computed Fourier transform of images of crystals extending to the third order and ∼20-Å resolution. A computed transform is displayed in Fig. 5 alongside a micrograph of a negatively stained CFTR crystal. Analysis of >100 separate crystals showed that there were two discrete crystal forms with significantly different unit cell parameters (Tables I and II). One crystal form was ∼3× more frequent than the other, although we have calculated a three-dimensional structure for both crystal forms, which are presented here. Tables I and II summarizes the electron crystallographic data collection. The number of observations/structure factor in the two data sets was ∼4-5 (i.e. a mean redundancy of 4-5). The resolution limit for the data in the xy plane of the crystals was ∼20 Å, as judged by the interimage phase residuals calculated for the untilted crystals. Resolution along z (perpendicular to the crystal plane) was estimated to be ∼30 Å as judged by examination of the phase variation along lattice lines (Fig. 5d) as well as by a visual assessment of the features distributed along z in the three-dimensional maps (Fig. 6).Fig. 5Electron microscopy. a, electron micrograph of a two-dimensional crystal of CFTR after negative staining.

ProMMP-2 activation requires multimolecular complex assembly involving proMMP-2, membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP, MMP-14), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2). Because transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) promotes tumor invasion in advanced squamous cell carcinomas, the role of TGF-β1 in the regulation of MMP activity in a cellular model of invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma was examined. Treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells with TGF-β1 promoted MMP-dependent cell scattering and collagen invasion, increased expression of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, and enhanced MMP-2 activation. TGF-β1 induced concomitant activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, and kinase inhibition studies revealed a negative regulatory role for ERK1/2 in modulating acquisition of MMP-2 activity. Thus, a reciprocal effect on proMMP-2 activation was observed whereupon blocking ERK1/2 phosphorylation promoted proMMP-2 activation and MT1-MMP activity, whereas inhibiting p38 MAPK activity decreased proteolytic potential. The cellular mechanism for the control of MT1-MMP catalytic activity involved concurrent reciprocal modulation of TIMP-2 expression by ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs, such that inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation decreased TIMP-2 production, and down-regulation of p38 MAPK activity enhanced TIMP-2 synthesis. Further, p38 MAPK inhibition promoted ERK1/2 phosphorylation, providing additional evidence for cross-talk between MAPK pathways.

Consequently, MMPs contribute to a wide array of biological activities including wound healing, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (1Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev.

Moreover, MMPs are involved in tissue invasion by a number of different cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (4Sutinen M. Kainulainen T. Hurskainen T. Vesterlund E. Alexander J.P.

Furthermore, increased expression of MMP-2 is associated with decreased staining of peritumoral extracellular matrix, suggesting that MMP-2 promotes matrix breakdown. MMP-2 is secreted from cells as a zymogen (proMMP-2) and is activated post-translationally by a trans-membrane MMP designated membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP, MMP-14), the expression of which is also up-regulated in advanced, metastatic cases of OSCC (4Sutinen M.

The activation of proMMP-2 is regulated by a complex mechanism involving formation of a trimolecular complex with MT1-MMP and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) (7Itoh Y. Ito A.

TIMP-2 bridges the interaction between the MMP-2 zymogen and MT1-MMP such that at low TIMP-2 concentration, an adjacent TIMP-2-free MT1-MMP can effectively activate proMMP-2. However, at high TIMP-2 concentration, all of the cell surface MT1-MMP undergoes complex formation with TIMP-2, thereby inhibiting proMMP-2 activation. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) regulates a wide array of cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (10Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat.

Binding of TGF-β1 to its type II receptor (TβRII) promotes TβRII association with and phosphorylation of type I receptor (TβRI), which then phosphorylates receptor-associated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3. The R-Smads then bind to Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus, wherein the complex can associate with transcription factors and activate target genes. In addition to the Smad-mediated TGF-β1 signaling pathway, recent data demonstrate that TGF-β1 can signal through distinct pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (26Hartsough M.T.

In this report, we have examined the role of TGF-β1 in the regulation of MMP activity in a cellular model of invasive OSCC and have evaluated the contribution of MAPK signaling to TGF-β1-induced MMP activity. Treatment of OSCC cells with TGF-β1 promoted MMP-dependent cell scattering and collagen invasion, increased expression of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, and enhanced MMP-2 activation. Mechanistic analyses of individual components of the MT1-MMP·TIMP-2·proMMP-2 trimeric activation complex demonstrated that these effects were mediated by cellular modulation of TIMP-2 levels. TGF-β1 also activated MAPK signaling, resulting in increased activation of both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs. Kinase inhibition studies revealed reciprocal regulatory pathways because inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation promoted TGF-β1-induced pericellular proteolytic potential, whereas inhibition p38 MAPK activity led to down-regulation of proteolysis. Further, p38 MAPK inhibition promoted ERK1/2 activation, providing evidence for cross-talk between TGF-β1-activated MAPK pathways. These observations highlight the complex reciprocal effects of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in the regulation of MT1-MMP activity, which could complicate the use of MAPK-specific inhibitors as therapeutic approaches to down-regulate the biologic effects of TGF-β1 on pericellular collagen degradation and tumor invasion in OSCC.

Protease inhibitor mixture was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Cell Cultures—SCC9, SCC25, and SCC68 cells are derived from squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. SCC25 and SCC9 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Tert-immortalized normal oral keratinocytes (OKF6 cells) and SCC68 cells were kindly provided by Dr. J. Rheinwald (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Boston) (31Dickson M.A. Hahn W.C. Ino Y. Ronfard V. Wu J.Y. Weinberg R.A. Louis D.N. Li F.P. Rheinwald J.G. Mol. Cell.

SCC25 and SCC9 cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. OKF6 and SCC68 cells were maintained in keratinocyte-SFM supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (supplied with the medium), 0.2 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 0.31 mm CaCl2. The cells were plated in serum-containing medium and serum starved overnight prior to treatment with TGF-β1. In additional experiments, inhibitors or other chemical reagents were added 30 min prior to TGF-β1 treatment. Analysis of Cell Scattering and Collagen Invasion—SCC25 cells were plated overnight on glass coverslips coated with type I collagen and treated with TGF-β1 in the presence or absence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 for an additional 24 h. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min, and stained with Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin, after which the cells were washed, mounted, and observed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser microscope. Invasive activity was quantified using a Boyden chamber (8-μm pore size) coated with 10 μg of type I collagen (33Munshi H.G. Stack M.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 2 × 105 SCC25 cells were added to the upper chamber in 500 μl of serum-free medium in the presence or absence of TGF-β1. In addition, 500 μl of serum-containing medium was added to the lower well to promote invasion. In selected experiments, the proteinase dependence of invasion was determined by quantifying invasion in the presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001. Nonmigrating cells were removed from the upper chamber with a cotton swab, filters were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik Stain, and migrating cells adherent to the underside of the filter were enumerated using an ocular micrometer and counting a minimum of five high-powered fields. Data are expressed as relative migration (number of cells/field). Analysis of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 Expression—Gelatinase activities in 24-h serum-free conditioned medium were determined using SDS-PAGE gelatin zymography as described previously (33Munshi H.G. Stack M.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-polyacrylamide gels (9% acrylamide) were copolymerized with 0.1% gelatin, and samples were electrophoresed without reduction or boiling using 5× Laemmli sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). SDS was removed through a 30-min incubation in 2.5% Triton X-100, and gels were incubated in 20 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2 at 37 °C for 24-36 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize zones of gelatinolytic activity. The conditioned media were concentrated 15-20-fold using Microcon 10 microconcentrators, boiled in Laemmli sample dilution buffer, analyzed for TIMP-2 by SDS-PAGE (15% gels), and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibody (Chemicon). MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and TIMP-2 Promoter Activities—pGL luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) containing the MMP-2 promoter (-1659 to +57 from the start site) was obtained from Dr. Y. Sun (Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Ann Arbor, MI) (35Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega) containing 3.3 kb of the MT1-MMP promoter was provided by Dr. J. A. Madri (Yale University) (36Haas T.L. Stitelman D. Davis S.J. Apte S.S. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22679-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The full-length 2243-bp TIMP-2 promoter expressed in pGL2 Luciferase Reporter vector (Promega) was obtained from Dr. Y. A. DeClerck (University of Southern California) (37Zhong Z.D. Hammani K. Bae W.S. DeClerck Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18602-18610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The dominant negative mutant of MKK3 was obtained from Dr. R. J. Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester) (38Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of MEK1 were kindly provided by Dr. D. Boyd (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) (39Gum R. Wang H. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 40Lengyel E. Wang H. Gum R. Simon C. Wang Y. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2563-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). SCC25 cells were transiently transfected with the various promoter luciferase reporter constructs in serum-free condition using TransIT keratinocyte transfection reagent or the Nucleofactor Amaxa kit specifically designed for keratinocytes using program T18. In additional experiments, 0.5 μg of the dominant negative mutant from of MEK1 or MKK3, or the constitutively active mutant form of MEK1 was cotransfected with the MMP-luciferase constructs. 6 h later, the cells were washed with serum-free medium to remove the unbound DNA-lipid complexes and treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h. The cells were then lysed and luciferase activities determined by luminometry. The results were normalized to protein concentration and expressed relative to control untreated cells. p38 MAPK Activity Assay—SCC25 cells were serum starved overnight and treated with 5 μm SB202190 for 30 min prior to treatment with TGF-β1. The cells were lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 60 min at 4 °C, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to MapKap kinase-2 as detailed previously (41Uddin S. Fish E.N. Sher D.A. Gardziola C. White M.F. Platanias L.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2390-2397PubMed Google Scholar, 42Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30127-30131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times in phosphorylation lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP), and the immunocomplex kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of Hsp25 protein (Stress Gen Laboratories) as a substrate and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were subsequently analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of Hsp25 was detected by autoradiography. Cell Surface Biotinylation—To label cell surface proteins, SCC25 cells were grown to confluence in a 6-well plate, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 30 min with 0.5 mg/ml cell-impermeable Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by washing with 100 mm glycine to quench free biotin (43Munshi H.G. Wu Y.I. Ariztia E.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41480-41488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were detached by scraping, lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) with protease inhibitor mixture and clarified by centrifugation. To isolate biotinylated cell surface proteins, equal amounts of protein from each sample were incubated with streptavidin beads at 4 °C for 14 h followed by centrifugation. After boiling in Laemmli sample dilution buffer to dissociate streptavidin bead-biotin complexes, the biotin-labeled samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% gels) and immunoblotted for MT1-MMP. TGF-β1 Promotes MMP-mediated Cell Scattering and Type I Collagen Invasion—Because TGF-β1 expression is correlated with invasive behavior in advanced squamous cell cancers (13Portella G. Cumming S.A. Liddell J. Cui W. Ireland H. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 393-404PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cui W. Fowlis D.J. Bryson S. Duffie E. Ireland H. Balmain A. Akhurst R.J.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7435-7443PubMed Google Scholar), the effects of TGF-β1 on cell scattering and collagen invasion were examined in a cellular model of invasive OSCC. SCC25 cells were plated on type I collagen and treated with TGF-β1 in the presence or absence of a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor (GM6001). Treatment of SCC25 cells with TGF-β1 promoted MMP-mediated cell scattering (Fig. 1A), as evidenced by inhibition of colony dispersion in the presence of GM6001. To examine the effect of TGF-β1 on invasion, SCC25 cells were plated in Boyden chambers overlaid with type I collagen to provide a three-dimensional barrier to invasion. Control experiments included the inhibitor GM6001 to evaluate the contribution of MMPs to collagen invasion. As shown in Fig. 1B, GM6001 blocked collagen invasion in untreated cells, indicating that collagen invasion by SCC25 cells requires MMP activity. TGF-β1 promoted collagen invasion by 2.5-fold, and the addition of GM6001 abrogated this effect, indicating that the TGF-β1-enhanced invasion was mediated by increased pericellular MMP activity.

https://openalex.org/W1969715546,"Reversible protein phosphorylation is an essential regulatory mechanism in many cellular functions. In contrast to protein kinases, the role and regulation of protein phosphatases has remained ambiguous. To address this issue, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress the catalytic subunit α of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (PP2Acα) in the heart driven by the α-myosin heavy chain promoter. Overexpression of the PP2Acα gene in the heart led to increased levels of the transgene both at RNA and protein levels. This was accompanied by a significant increase of PP2A enzyme activity in the myocardium. Morphological analysis revealed isles of necrosis and fibrosis. The phosphorylation state of phospholamban, troponin inhibitor, and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 was reduced significantly. The expression of junctional (calsequestrin) and free SR proteins (SERCA and phospholamban) was not altered. Whereas no increase in morbidity or mortality was noted, transgenic mice developed cardiac hypertrophy and reduced contractility of the heart, as well as cardiac dilatation as shown by biplane echocardiography. Taken together, these findings are indicative of the fundamental role of PP2A in cardiac function and imply that disturbances in protein phosphatases expression and activity may cause or aggravate the course of cardiac diseases.

Reversible protein phosphorylation is an essential regulatory mechanism in many cellular functions. Evidence has accumulated that, like protein kinases, protein phosphatases (PP) 1The abbreviations used are: PP, protein phosphatase; eEF-2, eukaryotic elongation factor 2; OA, okadaic acid; PK, protein kinase; PLB, phospholamban; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; TG, transgenic; TnI, inhibitory subunit of troponin; WT, wild type; PKA, protein kinase A. 1The abbreviations used are: PP, protein phosphatase; eEF-2, eukaryotic elongation factor 2; OA, okadaic acid; PK, protein kinase; PLB, phospholamban; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; TG, transgenic; TnI, inhibitory subunit of troponin; WT, wild type; PKA, protein kinase A. are tightly and efficiently controlled in the cell and that abnormalities in PP function can cause or at least modify the course of diseases in human (1Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). The main PP in the heart are serine/threonine phosphatases (reviewed in Ref. 2Herzig S. Neumann J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 173-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). They are grouped mainly into PP 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C (3Nairn A.C. Shenolikar S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The main phosphatase activity in the heart is because of the catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A. More than a dozen PP1c (catalytic subunit of PP1) binding and regulatory proteins have been identified up to the present (2Herzig S. Neumann J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 173-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PP1c can bind to the cardiac RYR2 probably mediated via an additional protein, spinophilin (4Marks A.R. Marx S.O. Reiken S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Holoenzymes of PP2A contain a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) and a regulatory subunit of 65 kDa termed PR65 (A subunit). A third subunit, B, can be associated with the core structure (5Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning revealed the existence of two mammalian PP2Ac isoforms α and β, which share 97% identity in their primary sequence. Both isoforms are found in high levels in the heart. However, PP2Acα is about 10 times more abundant than the PP2Acβ form, probably because of a more active gene promoter (reviewed in Ref. 1Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). The isoforms are encoded by different genes. PP2A is remarkably constant during evolution and may even be the most conserved of all known proteins (1Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Overexpression in mammalian cells has hitherto been unsuccessful. Only inactive PP2Ac has recently been expressed in a baculovirus system (6Myles T. Schmidt K. Evans D.R. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant of PP2Aα, however, has been expressed in the brain of transgenic mice (7Kins S. Crameri A. Evans D.R. Hemmings B.A. Nitsch R.M. Gotz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38193-38200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The B subunits confer subcellular localization, developmental regulation, and cell specificity to the PP2A holoenzyme (at least in brain). The A subunit is a structural subunit that is tightly associated with PP2Ac forming a scaffold to which the appropriate B subunit can bind (1Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar, 2Herzig S. Neumann J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 173-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). β-Adrenoreceptor stimulation leads to cAMP generation and to subsequent stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases. The β-adrenoreceptor agonists increase the Ca2+ release from the SR by stimulating the Ca2+ influx through the L-type calcium channel. Relaxation of the muscle is because of the Ca2+ pump in the SR, called SERCA. β-Adrenergic catecholamines enhance the activity of SERCA in an indirect way. Enhanced phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), an intrinsic membrane protein of the cardiac SR abolishes the inhibition of SERCA and more Ca2+ is removed from the cytosol into the SR. During the next heartbeat more Ca2+ can be released from the filled SR store and more force is generated. Hence PLB phosphorylation greatly contributes to the positive inotropic and relaxant effect of β-adrenergic stimulation in the heart (8Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Increased phosphatase activity might contribute to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure based on several independent lines of evidence. Increased mRNA expression and activity of PP1 has been noted in samples from patients suffering from end stage heart failure (9Neumann J. Eschenhagen T. Jones L.R. Linck B. Schmitz W. Scholz H. Zimmermann N. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 265-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10Mishra S. Gupta R.C. Tiwari N. Sharov V.G. Sabbah H.N. J. Heart Lung Transplant. 2002; 21: 366-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Increased phosphatase activity, if it is relevant, should lead to dephosphorylation of regulatory proteins, which has been reported by several independent laboratories: PLB (11Bartel S. Stein B.

Circulation. 1999; 99: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) are dephosphorylated in ventricles from patients with end stage heart failure. A causal link between heart failure and PP1 is further strengthened by an animal model. Chronic β-adrenergic stimulation by infusion of isoproterenol leads to cardiac hypertrophy, increased PP activity, and PLB dephosphorylation (15Boknik P. Fockenbrock M. Herzig S. Knapp J. Linck B. Lüss H. Müller F.U. Müller T. Schmitz W. Schröder F. Neumann J. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 262: 222-231Google Scholar). This is a clinically relevant model of heart dysfunction because increased β-adrenergic stimulation is a hallmark of human heart failure and many heart failure patients can be successfully treated with β-adrenoreceptor blockers. Cardiac specific overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PP1 in the mouse led to depressed cardiac function, dilated cardiomyopathy, and premature mortality consistent with heart failure (16Carr A.N. Schmidt A.G. Suzuki Y. del Monte F. Sato Y. Lanner C. Breeden K. Jing S.L. Allen P.B. Greengard P. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Grupp I.L. Hajjar R.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kranias E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4124-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). There is another line of evidence for a deleterious function of PP2A in the heart. Fostriecin, which is a somewhat selective PP2A inhibitor, can reduce the infarct size in rabbit hearts (17Hastie C.J. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Weinbrenner C. Baines C.P. Liu G.S. Armstrong S.C. Ganote C.E. Walsh A.H. Honkanen R.E. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. Circulation. 1998; 98: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on these findings we hypothesized that increased expression of PP2A might, similarly as PP1c, alter cardiac function. We report here the generation of mice with cardiac specific overexpression of PP2A and followed the biochemical and physiological sequels to dissect the exact function of PPs in the mammalian heart. Isolation of cDNA Encoding Mouse PP2Acα—Total RNA was extracted from mouse hearts using TriStar Reagent (AGS, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturers protocol. A 1382-bp fragment encompassing 69 bp of the 5′-untranslated region, the entire PP2Acα coding region, and 326 bp of the 3′-untranslated region was generated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methodology (flanked with NotI and SalI sites). DNA sequence analysis was performed by an automated DNA sequencer (Model 310, Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Generation of Transgenic Mice—The NotI-SalI restriction enzyme fragment encoding mouse PP2Acα along with its 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was excised from the reverse transcriptase-PCR product and ligated into the same sites of a mouse cardiac α-myosin heavy chain promoter expression cassette containing the SV40 transcriptional terminator. The transgene, composed of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter, the entire protein coding region for mouse PP2Acα (and 69 and 326 base pairs of 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences, respectively), and the SV40 polyadenylation signal sequence was isolated from the parent plasmid as a 7-kilobase NruI fragment and used for microinjection of fertilized mouse eggs (CD1). Transgene-positive mice were identified by Southern blotting and PCR assay of tail genomic DNA. One founder lineage was established and used for further studies. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from mice hearts was isolated as described above. For purification of polyadenylated RNA from total RNA the Oligotex-mRNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used according to the manufacturers instructions. For Northern blot analysis 10 μg of total RNA or 1 μg of mRNA was separated by electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridization was performed with EcoRI-EcoRV restriction fragments of the cDNA of mouse PP2Acα. Preparation of Homogenates—Frozen tissue samples were pulverized in a mortar precooled in liquid nitrogen. The following steps were carried out at 4 °C. Ten volumes of homogenization buffer containing (in mmol/liter) Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) 20; EDTA, 5; EGTA, 2; β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (v/v); phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5; and benzamidine, 1; were added to the frozen, pulverized tissue. The tissue was then homogenized three times for 30 s each with a Polytron PT-10 (Kinematica, Luzern, Switzerland). The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Protein was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, ventricular homogenates were prepared and 4× strength SDS buffer containing 250 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% (w/v) SDS, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 1.2% (w/v) dl-dithiothreitol, and 0.004% (w/v) bromphenol blue was added. The samples were solubilized for 10 min at 95 °C. Aliquots of 50–200 μg of protein were loaded per lane. Gels were run using 10% polyacrylamide separating gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, 0.45 μm pore size, Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany) in 50 mmol/liter sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 180 min at 1.5 Å at 4 °C. Then, membranes were treated with Tris-buffered saline containing 5.0% nonfat dry milk powder and 0.05% Tween 20 for 120 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with antibodies directed against different proteins and subsequently with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Bands were detected using enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescent bands were visualized in a STORM PhosphorImager and quantified using the ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal goat anti-PP2A catalytic subunit, polyclonal goat anti-PP2A regulatory subunit Aα (both from Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany), monoclonal mouse anti-PP2A regulatory subunit B56α (BD Transduction Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany), polyclonal rabbit anti-α4 (kindly provided by D. L. Brautigan, Charlottesville, VA), polyclonal rabbit anti-PP1α (BIOMOL, Hamburg, Germany), polyclonal rabbit anti-calsequestrin, polyclonal rabbit anti-SERCA2a (both kindly provided by L. R. Jones, Krannert Institute of Cardiology, Indianapolis, IN), monoclonal mouse anti-PLB (A-1, PhosphoProtein Research, Bardsey, UK), polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-PLB (antibodies were raised against PLB-peptide phosphorylated at serine 16 or at threonine 17, PhosphoProtein Research, Bardsey, UK), monoclonal mouse anti-TnI (2F6.6) or anti-phospho-TnI (1E11.3) (kindly provided by G. S. Bodor, Denver Health Medical Center, Denver, CO), polyclonal rabbit anti-eEF2, and polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho(Thr56)-eEF2 (both from Cell Signaling Technology). Protein Phosphatase Assay—Protein phosphatase activity was determined with a slight modification as described previously (19Neumann J. Boknik P. Herzig S. Schmitz W. Scholz H. Gupta R.C. Watanabe A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H257-H266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with [32P]phosphorylase a as substrate. Homogenates were diluted to 0.5 μg of protein/μl in 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). 20 μl of okadaic acid in 1:20 (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide were added to 10 μl of diluted homogenates to give a final concentration of 10 nmol/liter. The homogenates were then preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C. 20 μl of incubation mixture containing 32P-labeled phosphorylase a and (in mmol/liter) Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2.5; caffeine, 12.5; EDTA, 0.25; β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25% (v/v), were added to the preincubated homogenates. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C the reaction was stopped on ice by adding 20 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid and 30 μl of 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Precipitated protein was sedimented by centrifugation and the radioactivity in the supernatant was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Histological Analyses—To analyze the morphological features of transgenic myocardium, dewaxed and rehydrated tissue sections of formaldehyde-fixed ventricular probes were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), elastica van Gieson, and Masson-Goldner trichrome. Masson-Goldner trichrome (not shown) and elastica van Gieson staining yielded identical results. Microscopic images of 30 fields were taken and representative micrographs showing H&E and elastica van Gieson staining are presented in Fig. 3. Immunocytochemical Procedures—For immunocytochemical analysis, routine paraffin sections of hearts of mice were mounted on polylysine-coated microslides (Menzel Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany). For antigen retrieval, dewaxed and rehydrated tissue sections were immersed in 10 mmol/liter citric acid (pH 6.0), and boiled in a pressure cooker at an operating pressure of about 103 kPa/15 p.s.i. for 2 min. After cooling the slides were removed, quickly washed in running distilled water, and transferred to phosphate-buffered saline solution. Phosphate-buffered saline was used for all dilutions and washing steps. Subsequently, sections were encircled with a water-repellent PAP-pen (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. After blocking nonspecific binding sites (Fc receptors) with BSA-c basic blocking solution (1:10, Aurion, Wageningen, Netherlands), sections were immunoreacted overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal goat primary antibodies recognizing the catalytic subunit of PP2A (Santa Cruz). Detection of bound primary antibodies was performed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Finally, nuclei were counterstained for 15 s with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (5 μg/ml phosphate-buffered saline; Sigma) and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The controls were omission of incubation with primary antibody and incubation in media containing the primary antibody that had been preincubated at room temperature for 2 h with a 10-fold molar excess of the corresponding control peptides. Microscopy and Image Processing—Immunostained sections were examined on a Zeiss Axiophot2 microscope equipped with appropriate filters. Separate images for 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, fluorescein isothiocyanate immunolabeling, and for autofluorescence of the myocardium and erythrocytes were captured digitally into color-separated components using an AxioCam digital microscope camera and AxioVision multichannel image processing (Carl Zeiss Vision GmbH). The blue (for 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), red (for autofluorescence), and green (for fluorescein isothiocyanate) components were merged, and composite images were imported as JPG files into Photo-Impact 3.0 (Ulead Systems, Inc., Torrance, CA) for analysis on Power PC followed with printing on a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 970Cxi color printer. Images shown are representative of three independent experiments that gave similar results. Echocardiography and Doppler Studies—Transthoracic echocardiographic measurements were performed on mice that were anesthetized intraperitoneally with a mixture of ketamine S (25 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) allowing spontaneous breathing. All measurements were made using a commercially available echocardiographic system (Philips Sonos 5500) equipped with a 15 MHz linear transducer for two-dimensional and M-mode imaging and a 12-MHz transducer for Doppler measurements. The parasternal long and short axes were obtained. Five heartbeats for every parameter were analyzed. The fractional shortening of the heart was calculated from the M-mode left ventricular diameters as (LVEDD-LVESD)/LVEDD × 100, where LVEDD was the end-diastolic diameter and LVESD the end-systolic diameter. In addition, Doppler flow measurements of aortic and mitral flow were performed. The analysis of data was performed by two observers, who were blinded to the mouse lineage. Hemodynamic Performance—Left ventricular catheterization was performed in closed-chest mice anesthetized with tribromoethanol (15 μl/g body weight of a 2.5% solution). Through the right carotid artery a 1.8 French size polyethylene catheter (Micromed, Houston, TX) was inserted into the left ventricle. Analog pressure signals were obtained using a pressure transducer TXD-310 (Micromed), recorded, and digitized at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz with the PowerLab system (ADInstruments, Grand Junction, CO). The left jugular vein was cannulated for intravenous access. Increasing doses of the β-adrenoreceptor agonist dobutamine were administered via the left jugular vein using an automated syringe pump (B. Braun Melsungen). Heart rate, blood pressure, and the first derivative of left intraventricular pressure (+dP/dt and -dP/dt) were measured continuously. Ca2+Transients and Shortening of Isolated Cardiomyocytes—Isolation of ventricular myocytes from PP2A transgenic and wild type mice, measurement of Ca2+ transients, and measurement of cell shortening were performed as described previously (20Kirchhefer U. Neumann J. Baba H.A. Begrow F. Kobayashi Y.M. Reinke U. Schmitz W. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4142-4149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with the fluorescence dye Indo-1/AM and stimulated at 0.5 Hz. Excitation was at 365 nm, and the emitted fluorescence was recorded at 405 and 495 nm. The ratio of fluorescence at the two wavelengths was used as an index of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Contractility of isolated cardiomyocytes was recorded with an edge detection system. The maximal magnitude of contraction was normalized to resting cell length and expressed as percent of shortening. Whole Cell L-type Ca2+Current (ICa)—Single cardiomyocytes were studied using the whole cell patch clamp technique as described previously (20Kirchhefer U. Neumann J. Baba H.A. Begrow F. Kobayashi Y.M. Reinke U. Schmitz W. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4142-4149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recordings were performed under conditions that suppress Na+ and K+ currents. Ca2+ currents were elicited by voltage steps from a holding potential of -40 mV to a test potential of +10 mV for 200 ms, applied every 10 s. Cell capacitance and ICa were recorded with an L/M-PC amplifier (LIST-Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany) according to standard protocols. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were evaluated using Student's t test, with significance imparted at the p < 0.05 level. Overexpression of PP2A Catalytic Subunit in the Heart of Transgenic Mice—The mouse cDNA encoding PP2Acα was cloned from mouse hearts by reverse transcriptase-PCR and the sequence was confirmed by bidirectional sequencing. This cDNA was inserted into the expression cassette of an α-myosin heavy chain promoter containing vector. Standard procedures for generation of transgenic (TG) mice were used. One TG founder with germline transmission of the transgene was obtained. PP2Ac expression in hearts from 10-week-old TG and wild type (WT) mice was studied by Northern and Western blotting. In Northern blots from both total RNA and mRNA we noted a clear detection of the transgene (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, cardiac tissue was subjected to Western blotting to study protein expression. Here we also noted an elevation in PP2Acα expression. This was quantified as a 2.1-fold increase (Fig. 1C and Table I). The activity and localization of PP2Ac can be modified by different regulatory subunits. Therefore, we studied the expression of subunits Aα, B56α and α4, but no differences between TG and WT mice were observed in Western blotting (Fig. 1C and Table I).Table ICardiac protein expression and phosphorylation in PP2A-transgenic mice Homogenates prepared from ventricular tissue of mice at 10 or 16 weeks of age were subjected to Western blot analysis. The obtained band intensities were normalized to the average level of the specific protein in wild type samples.

We found an enhanced total phosphatase activity by 28% (Fig. 2). To discriminate PP2A activity from PP1 activity we used 10 nm okadaic acid (OA), a concentration known to inhibit only PP2A but not PP1 (21Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). On the assumption that the total activity was mainly based on PP1 and PP2A activity, PP2A activity was calculated as total activity minus activity in the presence of 10 nm OA. Whereas PP1 activity was unchanged between WT and TG mice, PP2A activity was enhanced 1.7-fold in TG homogenates. Therefore, the contribution of PP2A to the total protein phosphatase activity was shifted from 35% in WT hearts to 48% in TG hearts (Fig. 2). To visualize PP2Acα expression in the myocardium, we carried out immunostaining of PP2Acα in ventricular sections. Fig. 3A demonstrates localization and increased expression of PP2Acα in cardiac myocytes of 10-week-old TG mice. We also used hematoxylin and eosin (Fig. 3B), as well as elastica van Gieson (Fig. 3C) and Masson-Goldner trichrome (not shown) staining, and demonstrated isles of necrosis and indications of reactive fibrosis in the TG hearts. No such alterations were seen in littermate control hearts. Expression and Phosphorylation of Regulatory Proteins in Hearts of PP2A-transgenic Mice—In contrast to PP2A, the expression of the catalytic subunit of PP1 remained unchanged (Table I). Additional Western blotting experiments with ventricular homogenates from 16-week-old mice showed that the protein expression of protein kinase A (PKA), eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2), calsequestrin, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), PLB, and the inhibitory subunit of TnI remained unchanged in TG hearts (Fig. 4 and Table I). Importantly, the phosphorylation state of the Ca2+ regulatory proteins PLB and TnI as well as the phosphorylation state of eEF-2 was reduced in TG hearts. Analyses with phospho-specific antibodies revealed a decreased phosphorylation of TnI by 8.5%. A typical blot is depicted in Fig. 4B. The phosphorylation state of PLB at serine 16 and threonine 17, as detected by antibodies, was reduced by 7.9 and 12.9%, respectively, in TG ventricles (Fig. 4A and Table I). Moreover, the phosphorylation state of eEF-2 was reduced by 62% (Fig. 4C and Table I). Hypertrophy, Dilatation, and Reduced Contractility of PP2A-transgenic Hearts—The absolute and relative heart weights were increased in 10-week-old TG mice by 29.5 and 23.4%, respectively (Table II). This was accompanied by cellular hypertrophy (Table II). As cardiac hypertrophy may affect heart function we studied the hemodynamic phenotype of the transgene overexpression. Cardiac catheterization revealed decreased pressure development in the left ventricle of 16-week-old TG mice (Table III). In TG mice the maximal rate of left ventricular pressure development was decreased by 42%, and the maximal rate of pressure decline was decreased by 47% compared with WT hearts. To study the response to β-adrenergic stimulation, mice were stimulated by infusion of dobutamine, a β-adrenergic agonist. Whereas the positive chronotropic effect (Fig. 5A) was comparable, the maximal response in developed intraventricular pressure and its first derivative to β-adrenergic stimulation were blunted in TG mice (Fig. 5,B–D). With the highest dose of dobutamine applied (500 μg/kg), the left ventricular pressure and its first derivative were elevated by 21.1"

A variety of experimental approaches to interfere with prion conversion have been reported. Our interest was whether interference with intracellular signaling events has an impact on this conversion process. We screened ∼50 prototype inhibitors of specific signaling pathways in prion-infected cells for their capacity to affect prion conversion. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was highly effective against PrPSc propagation, with an IC50 of ≤1 μm. STI571 cleared prion-infected cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner from PrPSc without influencing biogenesis, localization, or biochemical features of PrPc. Interestingly, this compound did not interfere with the de novo formation of PrPSc but activated the lysosomal degradation of pre-existing PrPSc, lowering the half-life of PrPSc from ≥24 h to <9 h. Our data indicate that among the kinases known to be inhibited by STI571, c-Abl is likely responsible for the observed anti-prion effect. Taken together, we demonstrate that treatment with STI571 strongly activates the lysosomal degradation of PrPSc and that substances specifically interfering with cellular signaling pathways might represent a novel class of anti-prion compounds.

Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative infectious disorders that can manifest as sporadic, inherited, or acquired forms. They are also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straüssler-Scheinker syndrome, kuru, fatal familial insomnia, and variant CJD in humans, scrapie in sheep, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle. Prion diseases originate from the accumulation of an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPc), denoted PrPSc, which is the main component of infectious prions (1Prusiner S.B.

Sci. 2001; 356: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized PrPc is transported along the secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi to reach the cell surface, where it is attached by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor (4Borchelt D.R. Scott M. Taraboulos N. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 5Taraboulos A. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. J.

The cell surface expression of PrPc seems to be essential for the conversion of PrPc into PrPSc. The conversion is thought to take place either directly at the plasma membrane or in the early compartments of the endocytic pathway, e.g. caveolae or rafts, specialized regions enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, and glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (7Naslavsky N.

Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 1268-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The conversion process comprises profound changes in the structure and the biochemical properties of PrP. The α-helical conformation of PrPc is converted into the mainly β-sheeted structure of PrPSc. In contrast to PrPc, the pathogenic PrPSc is highly insoluble and partially resistant to proteolytic digestion (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5087) Google Scholar, 2Collinge J. Annu. Rev. Neurosi. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 3Weissmann C. Raeber A.J.

Commun. 1998; 250: 187-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of the conversion is still enigmatic, although two models are currently under consideration. The first model favors a crystallization reaction, where PrPSc acts as the crystal seed. Newly converted PrPSc molecules are added to that seed, forming PrPSc aggregates (11Come J.H. Fraser P.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5959-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The second model postulates a template-assisted conversion with intermediates, possibly PrPc·PrPSc heterodimer complexes (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5087) Google Scholar, 9Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). A variety of experimental approaches for interfering with prion conversion have been reported. Some of them target PrPc, as the conversion can be blocked by removing the substrate of the process. This can be achieved by preventing the expression of PrPc (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), Congo Red is thought to overstabilize PrPc in its equilibrium with suggested folding intermediates (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, it has been shown that copper binds to the octarepeat-containing N-terminal region of PrPc, resulting in a suggested antioxidant activity of the protein (31Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W.

Therefore, a functional role for PrPc in copper metabolism and cellular protection against oxidative stress has been proposed (32Wong B.S. Pan T. Liu T. Li R. Petersen R.B. Jones I.M. Gambetti P. Brown D.R. Sy M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recent work points to a role for PrPc in signal transduction. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of PrPc on the surface of the murine neuronal 1C11-differentiated cell line promotes the dephosphorylation and activation of Fyn kinase (33Mouillet-Richard S.

A further implication of PrPc in neuronal survival and differentiation is supported by the finding that different signal transduction pathways involved in neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival are elicited by PrPc (34Chen S. Mange A. Dong L. Lehmann S. Schachner M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and PrP–/– mice expressing N-terminally truncated PrP show severe neurodegeneration soon after birth (35Shmerling D. Hegyi I.

We have shown previously that PrPc interacts in vitro and in cultured cells with pint, synapsin 1, and grb2, the latter two representing proteins involved in cellular signaling (36Spielhaupter C.

In the present study we investigate the potential role of cell signaling interference in PrPSc propagation. Multiple substances were screened that interfere with specific signaling pathways in prion-infected cells for their effect on PrPSc. STI571 (Gleevec®, imatinib mesylate), an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase c-Abl, was found to be highly effective in inducing the clearance of PrPSc in prion-infected cells without interfering with biogenesis, localization, and biochemical features of PrPc. Our results demonstrate that, although STI571 has no major effect on the de novo formation of PrPSc, it activates the lysosomal degradation of pre-existing PrPSc.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—STI571 was purchased from Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. (Basel, Switzerland). Proteinase K, Pefabloc proteinase inhibitor, and pepstatin A were obtained from Roche Applied Science. The inhibitor CT52923 was kindly provided by Millenium Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA). Suramin was purchased from Bayer (Leverkusen, Germany). Immunoblotting was done using the enhanced chemiluminescence blotting technique (ECL plus) from Amersham Biosciences.

Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence or flow cytometry (FACS) 2The abbreviations used are: FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PK, proteinase K; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PIPLC, phosphatidyl-inositol specific phospholipase C. were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated immunoglobulins obtained from Dako or Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). [35S]Met/Cys (Promix; 1000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Protein A-Sepharose and Protein G-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. c-Abl substrate was from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Cell culture media and solutions were obtained from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany). All other chemicals were from Roche Applied Science.Cell Culture and Mode of Drug Application—The mouse neuroblastoma cell lines N2a (ATCC CCL 131), 3F4-PrP overexpressing N2a and ScN2a, the mouse hypothalamic cell line ScGT1, and the non-neuronal mouse cell line SMBs.15 have been described (13Gilch S.

Cells were maintained in Opti-MEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and glutamine, with exception of SMBs.15 cells, which were maintained in Medium 199 with Earle's salts containing 10% newborn calf serum and 5% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and glutamine. STI571 was dissolved in Me2SO at a stock solution of 10 mm (storage at –20 °C) and was added to the medium to a final concentration of 10 μm (if not otherwise stated). Suramin was dissolved in NaCl (0.9%) at a stock solution of 200 mg/ml (light protected at 4 °C) and was added to the medium to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. As published recently (40Yu J.C. Lokker N.A. Hollenbach S. Apatira M. Li J. Betz A. Sedlock D. Oda S. Nomoto Y. Matsuno K. Ide S. Tsukuda E. Giese N.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 1172-1178PubMed Google Scholar), CT52923 was dissolved in Me2SO at a stock solution of 3 mm (storage at –20 °C) and used as indicated. In short term experiments (3 days) there was no medium change in between, and in long time studies the medium including the drug was changed on a 3-day basis (if not otherwise stated). In all experiments mock-control cells were used that were treated with solvent in an identical fashion to drug-treated cells.Immunoblot Analysis and Detergent Solubility Assay—Immunoblot analyses were performed as previously described (13Gilch S. Winkelhofer K.F. Groschup M.H. Nunziante M. Muranyi W. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schätzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Confluent cell cultures were lysed in cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate) for 10 min. For proteinase K (PK) treatment post-nuclear lysates were divided into two halves. One-half was incubated with PK (20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and digestion was stopped by the addition of proteinase inhibitors (5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, and aprotinin) and directly precipitated with ethanol. The sample without PK treatment was directly supplemented with proteinase inhibitors and precipitated with ethanol. After centrifugation for 30 min at 3500 rpm (4 °C), the pellets were re-dissolved in TNE buffer, and gel-loading buffer was added. After boiling for 5 min, an aliquot was analyzed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. For solubility assay, post-nuclear cell lysates were supplemented with proteinase inhibitors and N-lauryl sarcosine to 1% and ultracentrifuged in a Beckman TL-100 table ultracentrifuge for 1 h at 40,000 rpm (100,000 × g; TLA-45 rotor; 4 °C). Supernatant fractions were precipitated with ethanol, and pellet fractions were resuspended in 50 μl of TNE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and analyzed in immunoblot or radioimmune precipitation assays.PIPLC Treatment—For PIPLC treatment, ∼80% confluent cells were washed twice with PBS. 200 milliunits of PIPLC (Sigma) and STI571 were added in 4 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM medium and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The medium was collected, and the cells were washed extensively with PBS and lysed as described for immunoblotting. After a methanol precipitation of the medium and the cell lysate, both fractions were analyzed in immunoblot.Metabolic Radiolabeling and Immunoprecipitation Assay—Metabolic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation assays were done as described previously (13Gilch S. Winkelhofer K.F. Groschup M.H. Nunziante M. Muranyi W. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schätzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In brief, confluent cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h in RPMI without methionine/cysteine containing 1% fetal calf serum. Due to the long labeling period, the addition of 1% fetal calf serum is more convenient for the cells and had no negative influence on the labeling efficiency in our hands. The medium was supplemented with 800 μCi/ml l-[35S]Met/Cys (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h. For analysis of the de novo generation of PrPSc, ScN2a cells were simultaneously treated with STI571 (10 μm) or with suramin (200 μg/ml) (no chase). For determination of PrPSc half-life, STI571 (20 μm) was added only during the chase period. For both experiments, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in cold lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. Then lysates with and without PK treatment were subjected to a solubility assay as described above. Pellets were re-suspended in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate in PBS) with 1% SDS and boiled for 10 min. The pellet fraction was diluted with 900 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (supplemented with 1% sarcosyl), and the primary antibody (1:300) was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added for 60 min at 4 °C. The immunoadsorbed proteins were washed in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with 1% SDS, subjected to a deglycosylation step with peptide N-glycosidase F at 37 °C, and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.FACS Analysis—For surface protein analysis, STI571-treated (10 μm, 3 days) or mock-treated cells were suspended with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, centrifuged, resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 2.5% fetal calf serum and 0.05% sodium azide), and incubated for 5 min on ice. Primary antibody (A7) was incubated in a 1:100 dilution in FACS buffer for 45 min on ice and washed 3 times in FACS buffer, and the secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled, 1:100) was incubated for another 45 min. After the last wash cells were resuspended in FACS buffer with propidium iodide (2 μg/ml). Cells incubated only with the secondary antibody served as a control. The FACS analysis was performed in a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur apparatus. In total, from each sample 10,000 living cells, as determined by the propidium iodide staining, were analyzed.Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy—Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (Marienfeld, Bad Mergentheim, Germany) at low density 1–3 days before staining. Polyclonal antibody A7 was applied for 1 h on ice. Then cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After sequential treatment with NH4Cl (50 mm in 20 mm glycine), Triton X-100 (0.3%), and gelatin (0.2%) for 10 min each at room temperature, a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100 in PBS) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were mounted in anti-fading solution (Histogel; Linaris, Wertheim-Bettingen, Germany) and kept dry at –20 °C. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was done using a Leica TCSNT/DMIRB Confocal System (Heerbrugg, Switzerland).Transient Expression of a Trans-dominant Negative c-Abl Mutant— For generation of a trans-dominant negative mutant of c-Abl tyrosine kinase, the lysine residue at position 271 was mutated to a methionine. This mutation is located in the ATP binding domain of the protein, leading to a complete inactivation of the kinase. As vector we used pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid pcDNAVSVc-abl-K271M encodes a VSV-tagged c-Abl mutant, which when overexpressed in cells inhibits the kinase activity of endogenous c-Abl. Lipofection of ScN2a cells with this construct was done using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to standard protocols. Four days after transfection the cells were lysed and analyzed as described for immunoblotting.Immunoprecipitation of c-Abl from N2a and ScN2a Cells and in Vitro Kinase Assay—N2a and ScN2a cells were grown on 15-cm dishes to 90% confluency, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm (4 °C). Equal amounts of total protein of both lysates were adjusted to 500 μl with lysis buffer. Protein G-Sepharose beads and 2.5 μg of anti-Abl antibody (Pharmingen) were added, and the reactions were adjusted to 1 ml with cold HNTG buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The immuno-adsorbed kinase was washed twice in cold HNTG buffer and twice in basis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 15 μm Na3PO4, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol) and then subjected to the in vitro kinase assay. The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 40 μl of basis buffer with 2 μm ATP (Sigma), 1.5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 100 μm c-Abl substrate (New England BioLabs) at 30 °C. After 20 min the reaction was stopped with 10 μl of EDTA (100 mm). The samples were briefly centrifuged and spotted on a P81 filter (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Waltham, MA). After extensive washing with 0.15% phosphoric acid the filters were rinsed in acetone, embedded in scintillation solution, and measured in a scintillation counter.RESULTSSTI571 Reduces PrPSc in a Time- and Dose-dependent Manner in Prion-infected Cells—Because various studies suggest a possible role of PrPc in cellular signaling, we screened about 50 prototype inhibitors known to interfere with specific intracellular signal transduction pathways in prion-infected neuronal cells for their effect on PrPSc propagation (by proteinase K digestion and immunoblotting). The initial screening was done by adding the compounds for 3 days at a concentration of 10 μm to the culture medium (Fig. 1). Compounds that had no detectable effect on PrPSc were excluded from further analysis. Compounds that were obviously toxic for the cells and those that had an effect on both PrPSc and PrPc were tested again at a concentration of 2 μm for 3 days. Most remaining compounds either had no effect on PrPSc or also profoundly affected PrPc. Several substances were toxic to the cells even at low concentrations. Among the compounds tested, only one substance (STI571, signal transduction inhibitor 571, also known as imatinib mesylate, Gleevec®) that had a highly significant effect on PrPSc propagation without cytotoxicity (as revealed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and trypan blue staining, data not shown) was identified. Treatment of prion-infected ScN2a, ScGT1, and SMBs.15 cells with STI571 for 3 days (ScN2a and ScGT1) or 10 days (SMBs.15), respectively, reduced PrPSc to undetectable levels (Fig. 2A, lanes 4, 8, and 12, respectively). In contrast, mock-treated cells showed significant amounts of PrPSc (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 6, and 10, respectively). The reduction of PrPSc was found to be time- and dose-dependent (Fig. 2, B and C). ScN2a cells treated for 1 day with 10 μm STI571 harbored the same amount of PrPSc as mock-treated control cells. After the second day, the signal for PrPSc was significantly reduced and was undetectable after 3 days of treatment (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–8). ScN2a cells treated for 6 days with different concentrations of STI571, varying from 0.25 to 10 μm (procedure according to Korth et al.41Korth C. May B.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9834-9841Crossref Scopus (596) Google Scholar), demonstrated a slight reduction of PrPSc with 0.25 μm STI571. Treatment with 1 μm STI571 led to a significant reduction of PrPSc to less than 10% of the amount present in the mock-treated control (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–7). Under these experimental conditions the IC50, which is defined here as the concentration with a 50% inhibitory effect on PrPSc propagation, was measured to be between 0.75 and 1 μm. Because the optimal results for the clearance of PrPSc in ScN2a cells were obtained with treatment for 3 days with 10 μm STI571, we decided to use a concentration of 10 μm for treatments longer than 1 day and 20 μm for 1-day treatments. In a longer term experiment, the efficiency of PrPSc clearance by STI571 was investigated. To test whether the observed effect on PrPSc is reversible or whether the cells remain free of PrPSc even after the removal of the drug (Fig. 2D), ScN2a cells were treated for 10 days with 10 μm STI571. In immunoblotting assays, the signal for PrPSc entirely disappeared in t"
https://openalex.org/W2008086014,"Sp3 is a ubiquitous transcription factor closely related to Sp1. Both proteins contain a highly conserved DNA-binding domain close to the C terminus and two glutamine-rich domains in the N-terminal moiety. Immunoblot analyses of Sp3 reveal a striking complex protein pattern of up to eight distinct species. This pattern is not observed in Sp3-deficient cell lines showing that all signals reflect Sp3 antigen. In this study, we have unraveled the complexity of Sp3 expression. We show that four isoforms of Sp3 that retain different parts of the N terminus are expressed in vivo. The four isoforms derive from alternative translational start sites at positions 1, 37, 856, and 907. An upstream open reading frame located at position -47 to -18 regulates expression of the two long isoforms. Unlike Sp1, none of the Sp3 isoforms is glycosylated. However, all four isoforms become SUMO-modified in vivo and in vitro specifically and exclusively at lysine residue 551. The transcriptional activity of the two long isoforms strongly depends on the promoter settings, whereas the small isoforms appear to be inactive. The transcriptional activity of all the Sp3 isoforms is regulated by SUMO modification. Our results demonstrate that Sp3 has many unique features and is not simply a functional equivalent of Sp1.

The transcriptional activity of all the Sp3 isoforms is regulated by SUMO modification. Our results demonstrate that Sp3 has many unique features and is not simply a functional equivalent of Sp1. The transcription factor Sp3 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the Sp family of transcription factor that is involved in the expression and regulation of many genes, including housekeeping genes, tissue-specifically expressed genes, viral genes, and cell cycle-regulated genes (1Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 2Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Sp3 contains a highly conserved DNA-binding domain close to the C terminus and two glutamine-rich activation domains in the N-terminal moiety. The expression pattern, the structure, and the DNA-binding properties of Sp3 are very similar to Sp1, which suggested originally that these two proteins exert similar functions. The physiological roles of Sp1 and Sp3, however, appear to be significantly different. Sp1 knock-out mouse embryos are severely retarded in growth, and die after day 10 of embryonic development (3Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Sp3-deficient embryos develop until birth, but die invariably of respiratory failure immediately after birth (4Bouwman P. Göllner H. Elsässer H.P. Eckhoff G. Karis A. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Suske G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, late tooth and bone developmental processes are impaired in Sp3-/- mice (4Bouwman P. Göllner H. Elsässer H.P. Eckhoff G. Karis A. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Suske G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Göllner H. Dani C. Phillips B. Philipsen S. Suske G. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Functional analyses of the transcriptional properties of Sp1 and Sp3 also revealed significant differences between these two transcription factors (6Bouwman P. Philipsen S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). On many reporter constructs containing multiple Sp-binding sites Sp3 is, unlike Sp1, inactive or acts only as a weak activator (7Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the inactivity of Sp3 under these conditions has been mapped to an inhibitory domain located between the second glutamine-rich activation domain and the zinc finger region (8Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that Sp3 is post-translationally modified by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) 1The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; uORF, upstream open reading frame; WT, wild-type; eIF, eukaryotic translation initiation factor; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. within its inhibitory domain and that SUMO modification leads to inactivation (9Ross S. Best J.L. Zon L.I. Gill G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 10Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). All previously published studies with Sp3 (more than 500 citations in Medline) were performed with N-terminally truncated versions of Sp3. In addition, unraveling the transcriptional role of Sp3 was complicated by the fact that several isoforms exist (2Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 11Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For long it was thought that full-length Sp3 protein is derived from translational initiation at a non-AUG codon, whereas two small Sp3 isoforms derive from internally initiated translation at AUG start sites (11Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, recently, human genomic DNA sequences were identified that encompass three exons coding for additional 85 N-terminal amino acids of Sp3 (12Oleksiak M.F. Crawford D.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here, we report the cloning of the full-length Sp3 open reading frame that starts with a classic AUG initiation codon. The full-length Sp3 cDNA enabled us to unravel the complexity of the Sp3 antigen pattern observed in immunoblots. We show that in vivo four isoforms of Sp3 are expressed that differ in the extent of the N-terminal part. Detailed mutational analyses suggest that all four isoforms derive from alternative translational start sites. Moreover, an upstream open reading frame regulates expression of the two long isoforms. None of the Sp3 isoforms are glycosylated. However, all four isoforms become SUMO-modified in vivo as well as in vitro specifically and exclusively at lysine residue 551. The two long isoforms of Sp3 can act as transcriptional activators on certain promoter settings, whereas the two small isoforms appear to be always inactive. Mutational analyses of the SUMO acceptor site in the context of different isoforms show that their transcriptional inactivity is regulated by SUMO modification. Our results demonstrate that Sp3 has many unique molecular features and is not simply a functional equivalent of Sp1. Plasmids—The missing 5′ part of the Sp3 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR of HeLa RNA using the primers 5′-actcggaattcCCTTTTGTGTTTCCCGCACAGTCA-3′ and 5′-CTGTGCAGAAGCCAAATCACCTGT-5′. The resulting 470-bp product was cut with EcoRI (artificial site at the 5′-end of the forward primer) and NotI (site within the Sp3 cDNA sequence) and cloned into EcoRI/NotI-restricted pSPT18-Sp3 plasmid that contained the original published Sp3 sequences (13Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 14Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription/translation assays of wild-type Sp3 and mutants, the T7/Sp6 promoter containing pSPT18 plasmid was used. Transient expression of Sp3 variants in Drosophila Schneider SL2 cells (15Suske G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 130: 175-187PubMed Google Scholar) was driven by the Drosophila actin 5C 5′-flanking region. For transient expression of Sp3 variants in mammalian cells the CMV promoter containing pN3, pMCS-HA, and pHA-MCS plasmids was used. pN3 was constructed by removing the GFP moiety from pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) with BamHI and NotI. The plasmids pMCS-HA and pHA-MCS (16Lange S. Auerbach D. McLoughlin P. Perriard E. Schafer B.W. Perriard J.C. Ehler E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4925-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) are derivatives of pEGFP-N1 and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), respectively, in which the GFP part of pEGFP is replaced by the HA epitope. Point mutations were introduced into pSPT18-Sp3 using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenized Sp3 cDNAs were subsequently recloned into pPac, pN3, pMCS-HA, or pHA-MCS vectors. Detailed information on the construction of individual plasmids will be provided upon request. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays—For activation studies SL2 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (15Suske G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 130: 175-187PubMed Google Scholar). Every plate received 4 μg of reporter plasmid (BCAT-2 or pGL3) and 2 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid p97b as internal reference. Variable amounts of pPacSp3 expression plasmids were compensated with the plasmid pPac. 24 h after addition of DNA, the medium was changed and 24 h later the cells were washed twice with PBS prior to harvest. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) enzyme expression was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously (17Brasier A.R. Fortin J.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of CAT or luciferase enzymatic activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Each transfection was repeated at least three times. For analyses of Sp3 isoforms SL2 and mammalian cells were transfected with the FuGENE6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Lysate preparation was as described before (10Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Microscopy—Stable transfected Sp3-/- KO MEFs or SL2 cells were plated on 13-mm Ø round coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates and 24-h post-transfection (SL2 cells) fixed for 25 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were washed twice for 5 min with PBS and subsequently permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-Sp3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times for 5 min with PBS and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch)- or Alexa Fluo® 594 (Molecular Probes)-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in a dark cabinet. After three washings with PBS for 5 min, coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Vectashield mounting media with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescence images were obtained on Leica DMLB microscope with a Leica N Plan 100×/1.25 oil objective. Immunoblotting—Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride membranes and probed with the appropriate antibodies. The following antibodies with the indicated dilutions in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% skim milk were used: rabbit anti-Sp3 polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:2,000; rabbit anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:2,000; rabbit anti-Sp1 polyclonal IgG (7Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G.

An enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize the peroxidase reaction. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Autoradiography—For in vitro transcription/translation of Sp3 proteins the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Radioactive labeled reaction products were separated through 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were subsequently treated with fixing solution (10% acetic acid, 25% 2-propanol) and Amplify reagent (Amersham Biosciences) prior to drying and exposure to x-ray films (Kodak). In Vitro SUMOylation Assay—SUMO modification reactions of in vitro transcribed/translated Sp3 proteins were carried out at 30 °C for 90 min in a total volume of 20 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml ovalbumin, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 5 μl of 35S-labeled substrate protein, 25 ng of E1 enzyme (Aos1/Uba2), 75 ng of E2 enzyme (Ubc9), 50 ng of E3 ligase (GST-PIAS1), and 200 ng of SUMO-1 (10Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by adding 2× SDS Laemmli buffer (Sigma). Wheat Germ Agglutinin Affinity Chromatography—293 cells expressing endogenous Sp proteins or transfected SL2 cells expressing Sp1, Sp3WT, or the Sp3K551R mutant were harvested in lysis buffer (40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). 100 μl of whole cell extracts (∼1 mg of protein) was diluted 1:10 in binding buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated with 50 μl of equilibrated agarose wheat germ lectin (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Matrix-bound glycosylated proteins where washed extensively in binding buffer before adding 2× SDS Laemmli buffer (Sigma). For competition experiments, 100 mmN-acetyl d-glucosamine (Roth) was added to the binding buffer. Binding of Sp proteins to agarose wheat germ lectin was analyzed by Western blotting. Complexity of Sp3 Isoforms—High resolution immunoblot analyses with antibodies directed to the C terminus of Sp3 resulted in a striking complex protein pattern. Four distinct proteins, two slow migrating species of more than 100 kDa and two fast migrating species of ∼72 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 5) were observed in nuclear extracts or whole cell extracts prepared with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Additional bands appear, when cells were lysed directly in SDS containing buffer. Under these conditions seven to eight Sp3 species are visualized in immunoblots (Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 4, and 6). All signals are specific for Sp3, because extracts prepared from Sp3-deficient embryonic stem cells did not cause any background (Fig. 1A, lane 2). In the past, analyses that could clarify the nature of the various Sp3 species were hampered due to the lack of a full-length Sp3 cDNA clone. The original Sp3 cDNA sequences (13Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 14Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) did not contain an AUG translational start codon, and it was postulated that translation of the Sp3 mRNA starts at a non-AUG codon (14Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In the course of a comparative sequence analysis among the evolutionary related Sp transcription factors Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 (19Kolell K.J. Crawford D.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the 5′-end of Sp3 is absent in the published cDNA clones. Moreover, human genomic DNA sequences were identified that encompass three exons coding for additional 85 N-terminal amino acids of Sp3 (12Oleksiak M.F. Crawford D.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we cloned the missing 5′ part of Sp3 by reverse transcription-PCR with primer pairs specific for sequences in exons 1 and 3 (GenBank™ accession number AF494280) (12Oleksiak M.F. Crawford D.L. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and fused it to the Sp3 coding region. The resulting Sp3 cDNA codes for 781 amino acids when translated from the first AUG codon. Expression of the four Sp3 isoforms observed in immunoblots can be reconstituted in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation assay using the full-length Sp3 cDNA clone (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Moreover, the additional Sp3 species observed exclusively in SDS-lysed cell extracts can also be reconstituted when in vitro translated Sp3 proteins were subjected to an in vitro SUMO modification reaction (10Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, lane 1). This result strongly suggests that the additional signals observed in SDS-lysed cell extracts represent SUMO-modified versions of the four Sp3 isoforms observed in non-denatured nuclear extracts. Very likely, highly active isopeptidases present in nuclear extracts readily cleave the isopeptide bond between SUMO and Sp3 unless special precautions are taken to inactivate these enzymes. All Four Sp3 Isoforms Are Derived from Alternative Translational Start Sites—The entire Sp3 coding region contains four AUG in frame codons at position 1, 37, 856, and 907 relative to the first AUG. To analyze whether the four isoforms (designated Sp3li-1, Sp3li-2, Sp3si-3, and Sp3si-4) observed in vitro derive from these potential translational initiation sites, we mutated each of the four AUGs in the context of the full-length Sp3 cDNA (Fig. 2A). Each AUG mutation resulted in the lack of the appropriate isoform in an in vitro transcription/translation system (Fig. 2B, lanes 3-6). Thus the four different isoforms derive from translational initiation at the four AUG sites leading to translation products of 781, 769, 496, and 479 amino acids that differ in their N-terminal end (Fig. 2C). We also analyzed an Sp3 cDNA mutant in which the first two AUGs were mutated (Fig. 2B, 1.+2.AUGm in lane 8). In addition to the two small isoforms Sp3si-3 and Sp3si-4, this mutant produced several new long protein products not synthesized from the wild-type cDNA. We speculate that these proteins arise from non-AUG initiation codons. Inspection of the cDNA sequence revealed indeed the presence of three potential non-AUG initiation codons in a strong context (gacGUGga at position 52, gcgGUGg at position 133, and gauUUGg at position 289). We also asked whether expression of any of the smaller isoforms is dependent on the context of the first AUG codon. The wild-type sequence acuAUGa was replaced by an optimal Kozak sequence (gccAUGg). In vitro, this mutation did not impair expression of any of the four isoforms (Fig. 2B, lane 7), which is in contrast to the in vivo situation presented below. Next we asked whether expression of the four Sp3 isoforms could be reconstituted in vivo after transfection of appropriate expression constructs. We cloned the full-length Sp3 cDNA and mutants into CMV promoter-driven expression vectors (pN3 and pMCS-HA vectors, see “Experimental Procedures” for details) useful for mammalian cells as well as in actin promoter-driven expression vectors (pPac) useful for insect Schneider cells (SL2 cells). After transfection of the wild-type Sp3 cDNA both long isoforms of Sp3 were expressed in 293 cells and SL2 cells similar to the situation in vitro. The two small isoforms of Sp3 were produced in 293 cells at low level but were not detectable in extracts from transfected SL2 cells (Fig. 2, D and E). It should be noted that SUMO-modified isoforms were observed in all cases where SDS extracts were prepared for Sp3 expression analyses (Fig. 2D). In those cases where we generated nuclear extracts, these post-translational modified proteins were not observed (Fig. 2E), because hydrolases presumably cleaved the Sp3-SUMO isopeptide bond. Mutation of any of the four AUG codons in the context of the full-length cDNA resulted in the absence of the appropriate isoform in 293 cells (Fig. 2D, lanes 2, 4, 7, and 8). In SL2 cells mutation of the first and second AUG codon also resulted in the lack of the corresponding isoform (Fig. 2E, left, lanes 3 and 5). These results strongly suggest that in vivo the four isoforms of Sp3 derive also from alternative usage of the four in-frame AUG start codons present in the Sp3 mRNA. Additional point and 5′-deletion mutants support this conclusion. Deletion of the 5′-non-coding sequences and the first AUG codon (Δ1.AUG) resulted in the absence of the Sp3li-1 isoform, whereas expression of the second Sp3 isoform was unchanged (Fig. 2E, lane 7). Deletion of the first 85 codons (Δ1.+2.AUG in Fig. 2E, lane 6) resulted in exclusive expression of the two small isoform (predominantly of Sp3si-4). Upon mutation of the first two AUG codons in the context of full-length Sp3 (1.+2.AUGm in Fig. 2D, lane 5) as well as upon deletion of 5′-non-coding sequences and the first AUG and simultaneous replacement of the second AUG by AGC (Δ1.AUG/2.AUGm, in Fig. 2E, lane 8), several new long protein products were observed. Similar to the in vitro situation, these new proteins likely arise from non-AUG start codons. The constructs used in the above analyses did not contain the full 3′-non-coding sequences. To test the influence of the 3′-non-coding sequences on the expression of different isoforms, we generated constructs with the complete 3′-untranslated region. The ratio of the four isoforms was not altered by the presence of the 3′-non-coding sequences neither in vitro nor in vivo (data not shown). Expression of the Long Isoforms Is Regulated by an Upstream Open Reading Frame—During the course of our studies, we realized that the 5′-non-coding region of the Sp3 mRNA contains a short upstream open reading frame (uORF) at position -47 to -18 (Fig. 3A). Because uORFs can participate in translational control (20Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), we asked whether the Sp3mRNA uORF is involved in the regulation of Sp3 isoform expression. At first, we generated two Sp3 cDNA mutants. In one of them the uORF initiation site was replaced by UAG (uAUGm), whereas in the other the uAUG, normally in a suboptimal context, is placed in an optimal Kozak sequence (uAUGoK) (Fig. 3B). These mutations did not alter Sp3 isoform expression in an in vitro transcription/translation assays (data not shown). In contrast, upon transfection in SL2 or 293 cells, the uAUGm mutation almost entirely abolished translation from the second AUG and enhanced initiation from the first AUG (Fig. 3C, lane 2 and Fig. 3D, lane 3). Vice versa, upon increasing the uAUG strength, the Sp3 isoform 1 and 2 ratio shifted toward the second isoform (Fig. 3D, lane 4, uAUGoK). Expression of the small isoforms of Sp3 was not significantly altered by these mutations. We also asked whether initiation site selection is dependent on the sequence of the uORF. The wild-type codons of the uORF were replaced by codons for glycine residues without changing the length of the uORF (PolyG mutant in Fig. 3B). Compared with wild-type, this mutation did not alter the ratio of the two long isoforms (Fig. 3D, lane 8). In conclusion, the peptide that might be translated form the uORF is not involved in initiation site selection. We also generated mutants in which the distance of the uORF stop codon to the first AUG start codon was increased by 17 or 35 nucleotides (insertion mutants In-1 and In-2 in Fig. 3B). These mutations shifted expression of the long Sp3 isoforms toward the first isoform (Fig. 3D, lanes 6 and 7). Hence, the distance of the uORF to the first AUG start codon appears to be important for initiation site selection. The SUMOylation Motif Present Exclusively in the Long Isoform of Sp3 Is Not a Target for SUMO Modification—Sp3 is post-translationally modified by SUMO at lysine 551 within the inhibitory domain of Sp3 (10Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Close inspection of the N-terminal amino acid sequence revealed another potential site for SUMOylation present exclusively in the first Sp3 isoform (Fig. 4A). Lysine residue Lys-9 lies within the sequence VKQE (amino acids 8-11) that fits well with the general SUMO conjugation motif ψKXE (10Sapetschnig A. Rischitor G. Braun H. Doll A. Schergaut M. Melchior F. Suske G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5206-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 21Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Obviously, an intriguing idea would be that the first and the second long Sp3 isoforms differ in their capacity to become post-translationally modified by a SUMO moiety at the N terminus. We asked whether lysine 9 is a target for SUMO modification in vivo or in vitro. Full-length versions of wild-type Sp3 or the K551R mutant HA-epitope-tagged at either the N or C terminus were transfected into Sp3-/- MEFs and 293 cells and subjected to immunoblot analyses. SUMO-modified Sp3, visualized as a slower migrating species, was detected with the wild-type Sp3 construct but not with the Sp3K551R construct (Fig. 4B). This result strongly suggests that exclusively Lys-551 becomes SUMO-modified but not Lys-9 or any other lysine residue of the Sp3 sequence. This conclusion is supported by results obtained in vitro. In vitro translation products of wild-type Sp3 as well as of the Sp3Δ1.AUG mutant lacking the first isoform of Sp3 but not of the Sp3K551R mutant are targets for SUMOylation in vitro (Fig. 4C). All together, these results show that lysine 9 within the VKQE motif, which is only present in the longest Sp3 isoform, is not a target for SUMO modification, neither in vivo nor in vitro. Unlike Sp1, Sp3 Is Not Glycosylated—The transcription factor Sp1 is post-translationally modified by glycosylation (22Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Because Sp3 is evolutionarily and structurally very closely related to Sp1, we asked whether any of the isoforms of Sp3 are also modified by glycosylation. Glycosylated proteins bind strongly to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and WGA affinity chromatography has been used in the past as a major step to purify Sp1 from cell extracts (23Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts of untransfected 293 cells and of SL2 cells transfected with Sp1, wild-type Sp3, or the SUMOylation-deficient Sp3K551R mutant were incubated with the wheat germ agglutinin matrix. Subsequently, bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analyses using antibodies to Sp1 and Sp3. As expected, endogenous Sp1 present in 293 extracts (Fig. 5, lane 2) as well as transiently (Fig. 5, lane 16) or stably (not shown) expressed Sp1 in SL2 cells bound strongly to wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 5). Binding was specific, because it was competed by an excess of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (Fig. 5, lane 4). Surprisingly, the small, the long, and the SUMO-modified isoforms of Sp3 did not bind to wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 14). The same holds true for the SUMO modification-deficient Sp3K551R mutant (Fig. 5, lane 12). These results clearly show that the transcription factor Sp3, unlike Sp1, is not a target for post-translational modification by glycosylation.

https://openalex.org/W2034537039,"4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), a highly reactive lipid peroxidation product, may adversely modify proteins. Accumulation of HNE-modified proteins may be responsible for pathological lesions associated with oxidative stress. The objective of this work was to determine how HNE-modified proteins are removed from cells. The data showed that alphaB-crystallin modified by HNE was ubiquitinated at a faster rate than that of native alphaB-crystallin in a cell-free system. However, its susceptibility to proteasome-dependent degradation in the cell-free system did not increase. When delivered into cultured lens epithelial cells, HNE-modified alphaB-crystallin was degraded at a faster rate than that of unmodified alphaB-crystallin. Inhibition of the lysosomal activity stabilized HNE-modified alphaB-crystallin, but inhibition of the proteasome activity alone had little effect. To determine if other HNE-modified proteins are also degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal pathway, lens epithelial cells were treated with HNE and the removal of HNE-modified proteins in the cells was monitored. The levels of HNE-modified proteins in the cell decreased rapidly upon removal of HNE from the medium. Depletion of ATP or the presence of MG132, a proteasome/lysosome inhibitor, resulted in stabilization of HNE-modified proteins. However, proteasome-specific inhibitors, lactacystin-beta-lactone and epoxomicin, could not stabilize HNE-modified proteins in the cells. In contrast, chloroquine, a lysosome inhibitor, stabilized HNE-modified proteins. The enrichment of HNE-modified proteins in the fraction of ubiquitin conjugates suggests that HNE-modified proteins are preferentially ubiquitinated. Taken together, these findings show that HNE-modified proteins are degraded via a novel ubiquitin and lysosomal-dependent but proteasome-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2010464551,"c-Myc-overexpressing mammary epithelial cells are proapoptotic; their survival is strongly promoted by epidermal growth factor (EGF). We now demonstrate that EGF-induced Akt activation and survival in transgenic mouse mammary tumor virus-c-Myc mouse mammary carcinoma cells are both calcium/calmodulin-dependent. Akt activation is abolished by the phospholipase C-γ inhibitor U-73122, by the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, and by the specific calmodulin antagonist W-7. These results implicate calcium/calmodulin in the activation of Akt in these cells. In addition, Akt activation by serum and insulin is also inhibited by W-7. EGF-induced and calcium/calmodulin-mediated Akt activation occurs in both tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic mouse and human mammary epithelial cells, independent of their overexpression of c-Myc. These results imply that calcium/calmodulin may be a common regulator of Akt activation, irrespective of upstream receptor activator, mammalian species, and transformation status in mammary epithelial cells. However, only c-Myc-overexpressing mouse mammary carcinoma cells (but not normal mouse mammary epithelial cells) undergo apoptosis in the presence of the calmodulin antagonist W-7, indicating the vital selective role of calmodulin for survival of these cells. Calcium/calmodulin-regulated Akt activation is mediated directly by neither calmodulin kinases nor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase). Pharmacological inhibitors of calmodulin kinase kinase and calmodulin kinases II and III do not inhibit EGF-induced Akt activation, and calmodulin antagonist W-7 does not inhibit phosphotyrosine-associated PI-3 kinase activation. Akt is, however, co-immunoprecipitated with calmodulin in an EGF-dependent manner, which is inhibited by calmodulin antagonist W-7.

One of the fundamental etiologic processes in tumorigenesis is the ability of cancer cells to evade programmed cell death, or apoptosis (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21919) Google Scholar). Potent cell survival signaling, in parallel with uncontrolled cell proliferation and other processes, ultimately leads to the development of a malignant tumor. In breast cancer, this pathologic outcome is strongly influenced by growth factors and/or hormones, which interact with their cognate receptors on mammary epithelial cells. Receptor-ligand interactions at the cell surface are propagated as cascades of signals through the cytoplasm, culminating in specific gene expression programs in the nucleus to define specific biological outcome(s). The serine/threonine kinase Akt is considered a central player controlling cellular survival (2Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E.

In addition to a PI-3 kinase-dependent mechanism of Akt activation, a PI-3 kinase-independent mechanism(s) of Akt activation has also been reported. The prime candidate mediating this mechanism is calmodulin kinase kinase, which directly phosphorylates Akt in a calcium-dependent manner (6Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Calmodulin, the allosteric regulator of calmodulin kinases, also regulates PI-3 kinase-dependent Akt activation, independent of calmodulin kinase kinase, and is known to control neuronal cell survival (25Egea J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28183-28186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but this binding does not result in the generation of phosphatidyl inositol 3,4,5-phosphates, which are required for membrane targeting of Akt and for its subsequent activation (10Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar). A calcium/calmodulin-dependent PI-3 kinase (hVPS34) cascade, responsible for phagosome maturation, has recently been reported (29Vergne I. Chua J. Deretic V. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A consensus sequence in the p110 catalytic subunit of PI-3 kinase has been predicted to be the binding site of calmodulin, but no biochemical data currently exist to support this idea (30Fischer R. Julsgart J. Berchtold M.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because mammary epithelial cells can release abundant calcium from intracellular stores in response to growth factors and survival ligands (31Ichikawa J. Furuya K. Miyata S. Nakashima T. Kiyohara T. Cell Biochem. Funct. 2000; 18: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Ichikawa J. Kiyohara T. Cell Biochem. Funct. 2001; 19: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that calcium plays a major role in survival of these cells. Our laboratory has already reported that EGF-induced survival of c-Myc-overexpressing mammary carcinoma cells is mediated by activation of PI-3 kinase/Akt kinase (33Ramljak D. Coticchia C.M. Nishanian T.G. Saji M. Ringel M.D. Conzen S.D. Dickson R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In search of a specific survival mechanism downstream of EGFR, which may be a therapeutic target in breast carcinoma, and to uncover any existing relationship between PI-3 kinase and calcium mediated activation of Akt, we undertook further investigation of calcium- and PKC-dependent survival mechanism(s). Our new studies resulted in the identification of a calcium/calmodulin-dependent Akt activation and survival mechanism in these cells. In particular, EGF-induced Akt activation is mediated by calmodulin, the universal calcium sensor, resulting in cell survival. We have shown that calmodulin does not exert its effect directly at the PI-3 kinase level. We have further shown that an EGF-dependent complex forms between calmodulin and Akt. This mechanism probably transports Akt to the plasma membrane for its activation by a PI-3 kinase-dependent mechanism. Perturbation of this targeting mechanism by calmodulin antagonism leads to apoptotic cell death in tumorigenic mammary carcinoma cells. This novel mechanism may have broader implications in the regulation of breast cancer, GLUT4 translocation, and neuronal survival.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—Mammary tumor-bearing MMTV-c-Myc transgenic and MMTV-c-Myc/MT-TGFα bitransgenic mice have been described previously (34Sinn E.

Hoechst stain was from Sigma. Phosphatidylinositol was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids.Treatment with Pharmacological Inhibitors and Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates—Semiconfluent cell monolayers were serum-starved overnight and then incubated with inhibitors for indicated periods of time. Cells were stimulated with 10 nm EGF for 3 min or for the indicated time periods (as shown in the text and figure legends) (in time course experiments) at 37 °C, and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-base, pH 7.4, 1% Triton-X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Lysates were vortexed and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of lysates were measured using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and Ultramark Microplate Imaging System (Bio-Rad).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed as described previously (42Deb T.B.

In brief, 1 μg of antibody was added to 500 μg of clarified whole cell lysates and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. 5 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added, and lysates were further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min and washed 3 times in lysis buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 3 min. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P; Millipore) membranes. Membranes were incubated in primary antibody for 2 h, followed by biotinylated secondary antibody for 1 h, and detected by Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) and enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).Hoechst Staining and PARP Cleavage Apoptosis Assays—Semiconfluent growing cells were transferred to complete medium containing either 30 μm W-12 or W-7. After 36 h, all floating and adherent cells were collected. Samples were centrifuged for 8 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were discarded, and cell pellets were suspended in a 1× phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.3% formaldehyde and 2% Nonidet P-40 and stained with 10 μg/ml of Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma) for apoptotic analysis. For each replicate, at least 500 cells were counted and evaluated for the presence of condensed nuclei and overall apoptotic appearance. For PARP cleavage assays, a third plate was treated with W-7, in the presence of 50 μmN-benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor. After 16 h, adherent cells were trypsinized and lysed, and equal amounts of total proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted by anti-PARP antibody.PI-3 Kinase Assay—PI-3 kinase assays were performed, using a modified protocol from Kapeller et al. (44Kapeller R. Prasad K.V. Janssen O. Hou W. Schaffhausen B.S. Rudd C.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1927-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-p85α immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μm vanadate), twice in a second buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm LiCl, and 100 μm vanadate), and finally twice in a third buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm vanadate). Lipid kinase assays were performed on washed beads at 37 °C for 10 min in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 40 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm vanadate, 0.2 μg/μl sonicated phosphatidylinositol (PI), and 20 μCi of [γ32-P]ATP (6000 μCi/mmol). At the end of the reaction, 80 μl of HCl (1 m) were added, followed by 160 μl of methanol/chloroform (1:1), and the organic layer was extracted and spotted on oxalate/EDTA-preactivated thin layer chromatography plates. Thin layer chromatography plates were resolved using a running buffer containing 60:40:11.3:2 chloroform/methanol/H2O/ammonium hydroxide.RESULTSEGF-induced Akt Activation Is Inhibited by Staurosporine but Not by GF109203X—Our previous observations implicated EGF-induced PI-3 kinase/Akt activation as a survival mechanism of MMTV-c-Myc mouse mammary carcinoma cells (henceforth called Myc83 cells) (33Ramljak D. Coticchia C.M. Nishanian T.G. Saji M. Ringel M.D. Conzen S.D. Dickson R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We next wanted to investigate the possible upstream signaling mechanisms regulating this Akt kinase activation and cell survival. In a previous study with small cell lung cancer cells, c-Myc sensitized these cells to apoptosis during nutrient depletion (45Barr L.F. Campbell S.E. Baylin S.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 381-392PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, PKC-β2 overexpression improved cell survival by protecting against c-Myc-induced apoptosis. PKCδ is also known to promote survival of small cell lung cancer cells (46Clark A.S. West K.A. Blumberg P.M. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 780-786PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, we hypothesized that EGF-induced PKC activation, upstream of PI-3 kinase, might be responsible for Akt activation. To begin to test this idea, serum-starved Myc83 cells were incubated with staurosporine, a broad spectrum PKC inhibitor, as well as GF109203X, a specific inhibitor of PKC (all isoforms) (47Gekeler V.

Cells were lysed, and equal amounts of total protein-containing lysates were probed by activation specific anti-phospho Akt (Ser-473) antibody. Although 1 μm staurosporine completely inhibited EGF-induced Akt activation, 5 μm GF109203X had no effect (Fig. 1A, WB: P-Akt S-473). 5 μm GF109203X also failed to inhibit EGF-induced Akt activation in serum-starved, bitransgenic MMTV-c-Myc/MT-TGFα mouse mammary carcinoma cells (henceforth called Mycα75 cells) and non-malignant mouse Comma D cells (37Danielson K.G.

Cancer Inst. 1986; 76: 1143-1156PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Staurosporine also caused significant inhibition of MAP kinase. However, GF109203X had no effect on MAP kinase activity (Fig. 1A, WB: P-MAPK). 5 μm GF109203X inhibited PMA-induced MAP kinase activation in all of these cell lines, indicating that it is active in these cells at this concentration (data not shown). To examine whether GF109203X inhibits Akt activation at later time points, the effect of both staurosporine and GF109203X on Akt and MAP kinase activation were examined in a time course experiment. Staurosporine inhibited Akt activation in a sustained manner, whereas GF109203X did not inhibit Akt activity at any time point tested (Fig. 1, B and C, WB: P-Akt). On the other hand, MAP kinase activity was significantly inhibited by staurosporine at 3 min, but substantial activity was regained at later time points (Fig. 1B, WB: P-MAPK). Similar to results in the short term experiment, neither EGF-induced Akt activation nor MAP kinase activity was affected by GF109203X in the time course experiment (Fig. 1C, WB: P-Akt and WB: P-MAPK). Taken together, these data show that EGF-induced Akt activation is mediated by a staurosporine inhibitable-factor but not by PKC.Calcium Chelator BAPTA-AM and Calmodulin Antagonist W-7 Inhibit EGF-induced Akt Activation—Staurosporine has been reported to inhibit a variety of kinases, including calcium/calmodulin kinase II (50Yanagihara N. Tachikawa E. Izumi F. Yasugawa S. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and PKC (51Couldwell W.T. Hinton D.R. He S. Chen T.C. Sebat I. Weiss M.H. Law R.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Considering that mammary epithelial cells release abundant calcium from intracellular stores in response to EGF (31Ichikawa J. Furuya K. Miyata S. Nakashima T. Kiyohara T. Cell Biochem.

Funct. 2001; 19: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that a calcium-regulated signaling mechanism downstream of EGFR might be a potential effector of Akt activation. To test this idea, serum-starved cells were preincubated for 90 min with 10 μm BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium chelator (52Bouchard M.J. Wang L.H. Schneider R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 53Bissonnette M. Tien X.Y. Niedziela S.M. Hartmann S.C. Frawley Jr., B.P. Roy H.K. Sitrin M.D. Perlman R.L. Brasitus T.A. Am.

Hoppe Seyler. 1993; 374: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and stimulated with EGF. BAPTA-AM completely inhibited Akt activity and partially inhibited EGF-induced MAP kinase activity (Fig. 2A, WB: P-Akt S-473 and WB: P-MAPK), whereas incubation of the cells with 2 mm EGTA (external calcium chelator) affected activation of neither Akt nor MAP kinase (Fig. 2A, WB: P-Akt S-473 and WB: P-MAPK). Identical results were obtained in both Myc α75 and Comma D cells (data not shown). These results suggest that EGF-induced release of calcium from intracellular stores is required for Akt activation in Myc83, Mycα75, and Comma D cells.Fig. 2Effect of intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, and calmodulin antagonist W-7 on Akt activation in Myc83 cells. A, intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM inhibits EGF-induced Akt activation. Myc83 cells were serum-starved overnight and incubated with Me2SO (DMSO; lanes 1 and 2), 10 μm BAPTA-AM for 90 min (lanes 3 and 4), and 2 mm EGTA (lanes 5 and 6) for 90 min followed by 3 min of EGF stimulation. Lysates were probed for activated Akt [WB: P-Akt (S-473)] and activated MAP kinase (WB: P-MAPK). Blots were reprobed for total Akt (WB: Akt) and total MAP kinase (WB: MAPK), respectively. B, calmodulin antagonist W-7 inhibits Akt activation but up-regulates MAP kinase activation. Serum-starved cells were incubated with 30 μm W-7 (lanes 9 and 10) or inactive analogue W-12 (lanes 7 and 8) for 30 min. Cells were stimulated with 10 nm EGF for 3 min and processed for Akt and MAP kinase activation as described in Fig. 1A. C, sustained Akt inhibition and MAP kinase activation by calmodulin antagonist. Serum-starved Myc83 cells were preincubated with 30 μm W-7 (lanes 18-24) or inactive analogue W-12 (lanes 11-17) for 30 min, and stimulated with 10 nm EGF for indicated time period.

Meyer R.K. Kenaga L. Rahbar F. Cotter R. Serban A. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PrPC and PrPSc undergo intracellular proteolytic cleavages with generation of distinct C-terminal fragments. PrPC is cleaved at amino acids 110/111 and 90, producing an 18-kDa fragment named C1 and a larger fragment of ∼20 kDa (6Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J.

Conversely, PrPSc is cleaved within the N-flexible region with formation of a fragment referred to as C2, sharing its conformation with PrP27-30 (6Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K.

Neuropathological hallmarks of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies include spongiosis, neuronal loss, and gliosis accompanied by PrPSc deposition at synaptic locations and at the rims of vacuoles or as large extracellular amyloid plaques and plaque-like aggregates (10DeArmond S.J. Ironside J.W. Prusiner S.B. Neuropathology of Prion Diseases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 585-652Google Scholar). Different patterns of PrP deposition and intracerebral regional distribution of lesions are explained by the existence of prion strains with identifiable biological properties and distinctive physicochemical features of PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5050) Google Scholar). sCJD has an annual incidence of ∼1-1.5 per million worldwide and a still unknown etiology; prevailing hypotheses suggest that the disorder is triggered by pathogenic somatic mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP) or by random spontaneous changes in PrPC conformation (11Prusiner S.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). However, there is concern that some sCJD cases could be secondary to environmental exposure, case-to-case transmission, or unnoticed food chain contamination, as suggested by the occurrence of atypical phenotypes, spatiotemporal disease clusters (12Collins S. Boyd A. Fletcher A. Kaldor J. Hill A. Farish S. McLean C. Ansari Z. Smith M. Masters C.L. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the increased incidence of the disorder recently observed in Switzerland (13Glatzel M. Rogivue C. Ghani A. Streffer J.R. Amsler L. Aguzzi A. Lancet. 2002; 360: 139-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because of the variability in clinical presentation, signs at evolution, and neuropathological changes, the disorder with the double eponym Creutzfeldt-Jakob should be properly called syndrome rather than disease. Different sCJD phenotypes largely correlate with the PRNP codon 129 genotype, a site of methionine or valine polymorphism, and distinct PrPSc types (14Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B.

However, controversial results have been obtained by different authors who have proposed the classification of sCJD PrP27-30 into two (14Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K.

Two main limitations of these studies are (i) the use of a relatively crude technique of protein separation, such as SDS-PAGE, and (ii) the detection of PrP species with an antibody recognizing the N-terminal 109-112 epitope, which precludes the recognition of PrP molecules lacking this region. Here we studied 32 subjects, with definite sCJD of all genotypes at PRNP codon 129 and with different PrPSc types, to characterize C-terminal PrPSc fragments in distinct disease phenotypes and host genotypes. Brain homogenates resolved by SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis were immunoblotted with anti-PrP antibodies recognizing epitopes located in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Here we report the detection of novel truncated PrPSc species in association with distinct PrP27-30 types. In addition, we provide evidence that sCJD phenotypes with PrP amyloid plaques or plaque-like deposits are associated with pathological PrP species matching the so-called C1 PrPC fragment. Patients and Tissue Samples—Thirty-two cases of definite sCJD, diagnosed according to current criteria, were investigated in the present study. Clinical, epidemiological, molecular, and pathological data are reported in Table I; postmortem intervals ranged from 4 to 30 h. Fresh brain tissues obtained at autopsy were stored frozen at -80 °C until use. Genomic DNA, extracted from frozen brain tissues, was searched for PRNP mutations and polymorphic Met/Val at codon 129. Neuropathological and immunohistochemical studies were performed as described previously (16Zanusso G. Ferrari S. Cardone F. Zampieri P. Gelati M. Fiorini M. Farinazzo A. Gardiman M. Cavallaro T.

The supernatant was stored at -80 °C, whereas the pellet was discarded. Detergent-insoluble fractions were obtained by 2 cycles of centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min, as reported previously (17Zanusso G. Righetti P.G. Ferrari S. Terrin L. Farinazzo A. Cardone F. Pocchiari M. Rizzuto N. Monaco S. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Protease resistance was assayed by incubating sample aliquots containing 40 μg of total protein with 100 μg/ml of PK (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C. The digestion was blocked by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 3 mm. The samples were deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were dissolved in sample buffer (3% SDS, 3% β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and boiled for 5 min. An equivalent of 0.4 mg of wet tissue was loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore) for 2 h at 60 V. The membranes were blocked with 1% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 37 °C and incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate antibodies. Blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), and PrP was visualized on autoradiography film (Hyperfilm, Amersham Biosciences). The following anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies were used: 3F4, recognizing human PrP residues 109-112 (1:30000); 6H4, binding an epitope between amino acids 144-152 (Prionics, 1:5000), and SP-214, directed against the 214-231 sequence of human PrP (1:1000) (7Jimenez-Huete A.

Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—For isoelectric focusing, using immobilized pH gradients in the first dimension, 8-cm long precast gels with a linear pH range of 3-10 were used. Before isoelectric focusing, the dry gels were swollen for 16 h in 125 μl of buffer (8 m urea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 2% ampholyte) containing 10 μl of sample (an equivalent of 1 mg of wet tissue). Isoelectric focusing was carried out at 20 °C for 30 min with 500 V, 30 min with 1000 V, and 1 h with 4000 V in a cooled horizontal electrophoresis unit (IPGphor, Amersham Biosciences). For the second dimension, the immobilized pH gradient strips were equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 6 mol/liter urea, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and a trace of bromphenol blue and loaded in a 12% SDS-PAGE as described previously (17Zanusso G.

Immunoblotting was performed as described above. Immunoblot Typing of PrP27-30—Brain homogenates from subjects either homozygous or heterozygous at PRNP codon 129 showed two distinct patterns of PrPSc electrophoretic migration following treatment with proteinase K and immunoblot with 3F4. In 18 sCJD cases (15 MM, 1 MV, 2 VV) three major bands corresponding to di-, mono-, and unglycosylated PrPSc species migrated at 30, 25, and 21 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1), whereas in 14 cases (3 MM, 5 MV, and 6 VV) the bands were detected at 28-, 23-, and 19-kDa zones (Fig. 1A, lane 2). In each group, following deglycosylation, the three forms (hereafter referred to as the “PrPSc triplet”) were reduced to the size of the unglycosylated fragment corresponding to 21 and 19 kDa (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). These PrPSc species correspond to type 1 and type 2 PrPSc, according to the nomenclature used by others (14Parchi P. Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K. Chen S.G. Farlow M. Dickson D.W. Sima A.A. Trojanowski J.Q. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Immunoblot of C-terminal PrP Fragments—In addition to the PrPSc triplet observed with 3F4, immunoblot with 6H4 showed a PK-resistant PrPSc band migrating at 16-17 kDa in all subjects with type 1 PrPSc (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3); a band with similar electrophoretic mobility was barely detectable also in MM cases with type 2 PrPSc (MM2) (data not shown). The 16-17-kDa C-terminal fragment was found in untreated brain homogenates and partially recovered in the detergent-insoluble fraction. These biochemical features, combined with the absence of this fragment in normal brains, suggest that this truncated form is mainly generated by an aberrant endogenous PrPSc cleavage. In marked contrast, following PK digestion and immunoblot with 6H4, sCJD brains from subjects MV and VV at codon 129 and with type 2 PrPSc contained only the PrPSc triplet (Fig. 1B, lane 2) but not the 16-17-kDa fragment found in cases with type 1 PrPSc and in MM2 cases. However, after PNGase treatment, PK-digested samples from MV2 and VV2 cases showed an additional band migrating at ∼18 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Finally, immunoblot with SP-214 of brain homogenates from different sCJD subtypes showed, in addition to the PrPSc triplet, several PK-resistant PrPSc bands, with the lowest molecular mass fragments being detected at ∼12 kDa. The pattern of PK-resistant PrP species obtained in cases with type 1 PrPSc disclosed indistinct banding in a range between 12-17 kDa, either prior to (Fig. 1C, lane 1) or after deglycosylation (Fig. 1C, lane 3), whereas in MV2 and VV2 subjects (Fig. 1C, lane 2), fewer truncated fragments were seen, migrating at 18- and 12-kDa zones after PNGase and PK treatment (Fig. 1C, lane 4). Effect of pH on PrP27-30 and on Truncated PrP Fragments—In a previous study, we observed that one type of PrPSc, detected in the classical form of sCJD, changes its conformation after exposure to acidic and basic pH values (18Zanusso G. Farinazzo A. Fiorini M. Gelati M. Castagna A. Righetti P.G. Rizzuto N. Monaco S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40377-40380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This property, likely dependent on the presence of octapeptide repeats in the PrPSc molecule, enabled us to distinguish two PrPSc types that share an identical electrophoretic mobility after solubilization in lysis buffer at pH 7.4. Following immunoblot with 3F4, the PK-resistant fragment of 21 kDa, detected in 9 MM subjects and in 1 VV case, migrated slower at pH 5 as compared with the migration observed when samples were solubilized at pH 8 (Table I). In contrast, PrPSc migration was not consistently modified in 6 MM, 1 MV, and 1 VV cases with type 1 PrP27-30 and in all cases with type 2 PrP27-30. To further clarify the influence of the octapeptide region in determining sensitivity to pH, brain homogenates from each single case of the group sensitive to pH were exposed to consecutive PK digestions, first to acidic and subsequently to basic pH. As expected, the immunoblots with 6H4 showed that, at acidic pH, the main fragment migrated at ∼22.5 kDa, and following further digestion at pH 8, it was detected in a 20-kDa zone because of the effect of an additional cleavage. Immunoblots with SP-214, recognizing the 214-231 C-terminal sequence of human PrP, showed similar results (data not shown) thus suggesting that the 22.5 and 20 kDa bands differ at the N terminus and not at the C terminus. Conversely, the electrophoretic migration of the C-terminal fragment of 16-17 kDa was unaffected by serial acidic and basic digestion procedures (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2), confirming the role of the octapeptide region in conferring PrPSc susceptibility to conformational changes. Two-dimensional mapping of PrP isoforms in control and sCJD brains—Recently, we provided a detailed two-dimensional mapping of PrPC glycoforms by using the 3F4 antibody, recognizing a linear epitope expressed in the full-length PrPC and in the C2 fragment (17Zanusso G. Righetti P.G. Ferrari S. Terrin L. Farinazzo A. Cardone F. Pocchiari M. Rizzuto N. Monaco S. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When analyzing PrPC in two dimensions, the customary di-, mono-, and unglycosylated bands of the protein, obtained after SDS-PAGE, are separated in several spots according to two independent features: the isoelectric point (which reflects the net charge) and the mobility (determined by the molecular mass). In addition, after two-dimensional separation, each spot can be assigned to glycosylated or unglycosylated species based on its shape, configuration, tail, and smear. Although the 6H4 antibody was unable to detect PrPC molecules after two-dimensional separation of control brain homogenates, the SP-214 monoclonal antibody revealed several glycosylated and unglycosylated PrP forms with faster migrating species being detected at 18 kDa, corresponding to unglycosylated C1 isoforms (Fig. 2A). Negative results obtained with 6H4 suggest that this antibody recognizes a conformational rather than a linear PrP epitope and that this epitope is lost after solubilization of PrP in high molar urea. After PNGase treatment, truncated PrPC glycoforms were all reduced into several spots migrating at 20- and 18-kDa zones (Fig. 2B), corresponding to PrP fragments referred to as C2 and C1, respectively. Differing from controls, each single homogenate of cortical areas, subcortical nuclei, and cerebellum from sCJD brains showed increased amounts of C2 (migrating at ∼21 kDa in cases with type 1 PrPSc and 19 kDa in those with type 2 PrPSc) and the presence of additional acidic PrP glycoforms and low molecular mass unglycosylated species. The composition, electrophoretic migration, and relative abundance of these PrP species were different among distinct sCJD subtypes. In particular, sCJD cases of all codon 129 genotypes with type 1 PrPSc were characterized by the increased expression of unglycosylated PrP forms in a 12-17-kDa zone as opposed to the low abundance of these species in the MM2 subjects and the prominence of low molecular mass acidic PrP glycoforms in MV2 and VV2 subtypes (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, truncated PrP species observed in different sCJD subtypes were partially recovered in the detergent-insoluble fraction from different brain areas (Fig. 3, A-C).Fig. 3Detergent-insoluble PrP-truncated fragments in sCJD brains. PrPSc was sedimented by high speed centrifugation as described previously (18Zanusso G. Farinazzo A. Fiorini M. Gelati M. Castagna A. Righetti P.G. Rizzuto N. Monaco S. J. Biol.

Occipital cortex homogenates from MM1 (A), MM2 (B), and VV2 (C) sCJD subjects, representative of molecular groups indicated on the left, are shown. In A, tissues from a sCJD subject with type 1 PrP27-30 show the presence of 12-14- and 16-17-kDa unglycosylated species, which are also barely detected also in MM2 subjects (B). In C, only unglycosylated 12-14-kDa spots are seen.

Castellani R. Capellari S. Ghetti B. Young K. Chen S.G. Farlow M. Dickson D.W. Sima A.A. Trojanowski J.Q. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). More recent phenotypic classifications propose six variants, which consider MM1 and MV1 cases a single subtype, whereas MM2 subjects are classified in two forms, cortical (MM2C) and thalamic (MM2T), named sporadic fatal insomnia (20Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S. Brown P. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Windl O. Zerr I. Budka H. Kopp N. Piccardo P. Poser S. Rojiani A. Streichemberger N. Julien J. Vital C. Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Kretzschmar H. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). With the exception of sporadic fatal insomnia cases (not available for the present study), all other molecular and phenotypic sCJD subtypes were investigated. PK-treated brain homogenates from subjects with type 1 PrP27-30 of all genotypes showed, in addition to 30-, 25-, and 21-kDa glycoforms containing the 3F4 epitope (Fig. 4, A, C, and E), more acidic SP-214-positive glycoforms of 21-25 kDa and showed several spots migrating at ∼16-17- and 12-14-kDa zones, pI 4-5 (Fig. 4, B, D, and F). Some variability was observed among individual cases in the relative intensity and representation of these spots, but their migration and configuration were highly comparable in all cases. Additionally, slight quantitative but not qualitative differences were seen in different brain regions from each case. After deglycosylation and PK-treatment, major glycoforms of 21-30 kDa were reduced to 21 kDa, pI 6.6-7.2, whereas lower molecular mass species were detected at 16-17- and 12-14-kDa zones, pI 4.5-5.5 (Fig. 4, B′, D′, and F′). In the MM2C group, the 3F4 antibody showed differently glycosylated forms of PrP27-30 (Fig. 4G), and barely detectable, faster migrating PrP forms were stained by SP-214 antibody in all sampled brain areas (Fig. 4H). After deglycosylation, the 19-kDa PrPSc core fragment was associated with low amounts of PrP forms showing a migration pattern similar to that found in subjects with type 1 PrP27-30 (Fig. 4H′). Finally, in the MV2 and VV2 groups, major 3F4-positive glycoforms of 29, 25, and 19 kDa (Fig. 4I) were associated with small amounts of 12-14-kDa species recognized by the SP-214 antibody (Fig. 4L). However, after glycan removal, a set of spots migrating at ∼17.5-18 kDa was detected in cortical and subcortical brain regions (Fig. 4L′). Based on their pI values and apparent molecular masses, these spots matched the corresponding C1 PrPC peptides observed after deglycosylation of normal brain homogenates (see Fig. 2B). These results indicate that in MV2 and VV2 cases, glycosylated C1 isoforms acquire PK-resistance, although the possibility that C1-sized fragments are generated upon protease treatment cannot be ruled out. On the contrary, unglycosylated isoforms of C1 detected in both normal and pathological brain homogenates (see Fig. 2, A and C) lack detergent insolubility (see Fig. 3C) and PK-resistance (see Fig. 4L) in sCJD brains. The schematic (Fig. 5) depicts different patterns of truncated PrP fragments found in association with distinct molecular sCJD subtypes. The present findings show that: (i) novel truncated PrP fragments are detected in distinct molecular sCJD subtypes; (ii) the combination of PrP27-30 and truncated PrP species identify three biochemical patterns of disease-associated prion protein; (iii) in MV2 and VV2 subtypes of sCJD, glycosylated molecules of the C1 fragment acquire biochemical hallmarks of PrPSc. Using sensitive protein separation techniques and Western blot with antibodies recognizing the C-terminal globular domain of prion protein, we have identified new protease-resistant PrP species in brain homogenates from sCJD subjects. These new fragments, detected in the mass interval between 16 and 18 kDa, showed two distinct and highly reproducible electrophoretic patterns, each segregating preferentially with type 1 or type 2 PrP27-30. The electrophoretic migration of these newly identified PK-resistant PrP products is, therefore, intermediate between the unglycosylated PrP27-30 fragment (which is currently used to classify molecular PrPSc types) and the 12-14 kDa PrP molecules observed in all sCJD subtypes and named CTF 12/13 (9Zou W.Q. Capellari S. Parchi P. Sy M.S. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40429-40436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The immunoblot detection of low molecular mass PrP fragments in untreated whole brain homogenates from sCJD subjects indicates that such fragments are generated by an endogenous proteolytic mechanism. It should also be emphasized that the detergent insolubility of these molecules and the lack of shift in their apparent molecular weight after PK digestion support the view that these PrP species adopt a fully protease-resistant conformation in vivo. Taken together, the present findings point out that multiple abnormal PrP conformers are expressed during the spreading of sCJD strains. This could result from diverse subcellular sites of formation or, alternatively, from the generation of PrP conformers from full-length and N-terminally truncated PrPC precursors. Furthermore, the identification of the 16-17- and 12-14-kDa forms in subjects of all genotypes with type 1 or MM with type 2 PrPSc suggests that the mechanism involved in the formation of these forms is not influenced by codon 129 and by the type of PrP27-30. Although the three classes of PrP fragments characterized in the present study show biochemical properties of pathological PrP, it remains to be determined if they maintain all of the biological properties of PrPSc. A further implication of the identification of 16-17-kDa forms is related to the molecular classification of PrPSc types encountered in sCJD. The influence of several experimental conditions, including pH and EDTA concentration, on the conformation of type 1 PrPSc and, therefore, on its electrophoretic migration is well known (18Zanusso G.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). On this basis, we propose the use of conventional Western blot with 6H4 antibody, which is able to detect an accompanying fragment of 16-17 kDa in all cases with type 1 PrPSc. Such a standardized molecular classification of sCJD would have major implications for epidemiological studies, whereas more sophisticated investigations, such as two-dimensional mapping and PrP sequencing, should be reserved for atypical cases. To date, the existence of distinct strains of the agent responsible for human prion diseases has been difficult to explain with just the biochemical findings of two main PrP27-30 conformations and with microsequencing analyses showing two truncation patterns in sporadic, inherited, and acquired diseases (21Parchi P.

It is well known that glycans may play a role in the phenotypic determination of some prion conditions, and their role has been recently proposed to explain differences between sporadic fatal insomnia and MM2 sCJD, two conditions sharing PrP27-30 type and PRNP codon 129 (22Pan T. Colucci M. Wong B.S. Li R. Liu T. Petersen R.B. Chen S. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37284-37288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, different glycosylation states of PrPSc cannot fully account for prion diversity. Recent transmission studies of sCJD to transgenic mice show three distinct incubation periods of different sCJD subtypes (23Korth C. Kaneko K. Groth D. Heye N. Telling G. Mastrianni J. Parchi P. Gambetti P. Will R. Ironside J. Heinrich C. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4784-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In particular, inocula from subjects MM1 and MV1 have the same incubation times, and, therefore, these molecular types appear as a homogeneous group. MV2 and VV2 cases, when transmitted to mice with Val at position 129, induce the disease at the same post-inoculum intervals and thus suggesting similar biological properties of these sCJD strains. On the other hand, MM2 inocula show heterogeneous transmission properties and incubation times different from the above groups. Based on the biochemical patterns obtained by combining the PrP27-30 core fragment and lower truncated PrP species, here we show three distinct groups of disease-associated PrP species in sCJD with type 1 PrPSc, MM2 subjects, and MV2/VV2 cases. Strikingly, similar molecular groups of PrP species are obtained by Satoh et al. (8Satoh K. Muramoto T. Tanaka T. Kitamoto N. Ironside J.W. Nagashima K. Yamada M. Sato T. Mohri S. Kitamoto T. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2885-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) when combining truncated fragments of 11-12 kDa with type 1 and type 2 PrP27-30. Whether the present biochemical findings represent a molecular basis for different biological properties of the above sCJD strains remains to be determined. Despite the recognition of conformational variants of disease-associated PrP species in experimental and naturally occurring prion diseases, little is known about the influence of different molecules on disease phenotype (24Lawson V.A. Priola S.A. Meade-White K. Lawson M. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13689-13695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although it is commonly believed that PrP27-30 has a major role in modulating sCJD phenotype, it would be of interest to learn whether different truncated PrPs are related to specific clinical and pathological traits. Previous studies have disclosed that an internal PrP fragment of 7-8 kDa detected in patients with P102L Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease (7Jimenez-Huete A. Lievens P.M. Vidal R. Piccardo P.

Here we have found that a fully glycosylated PrP fragment, closely matching the C1 PrPC fragment, was associated with amyloid plaques in MV2 cases and plaque-like PrP deposits in VV2 subjects. On the contrary, C1 PrPSc was not observed in sCJD subtypes lacking extracellular PrP deposition. It is noteworthy to emphasize that we also determined 2G. Zanusso, A. Farinazzo, and S. Monaco, unpublished observations. the presence of C1 PrPSc in subjects with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a condition characterized by florid PrP amyloid plaques) as well as in the newly identified bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE) (3Casalone C.

Earlier studies have shown that C1 is a cell surface glycophosphoinositol-anchored protein starting at amino acid 110/111 in human neuroblastoma cells (6Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K.

Terrin L. Farinazzo A. Cardone F. Pocchiari M. Rizzuto N. Monaco S. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). According to our findings, it is conceivable that extracellular release of C1 PrPSc could be responsible for PrP deposition and aggregation, as observed in MV2 and VV2 sCJD subtypes. Altogether, these results show that PrP-truncated fragments may influence the disease phenotype of sCJD and that their characterization is important for the molecular definition of sCJD subtypes.

A central component of the Des pathway is the response regulator, DesR, which is activated by a membrane-associated kinase, DesK, in response to a decrease in membrane lipid fluidity.

In this study we show that only the phosphorylated form of protein DesR is able to bind to a regulatory region immediately upstream of the promoter of the Δ5-Des gene (Pdes). Phosphorylation of the regulatory domain of dimeric DesR promotes, in a cooperative fashion, the hierarchical occupation of two adjacent, non-identical, DesR-P DNA binding sites, so that there is a shift in the equilibrium toward the tetrameric active form of the response regulator.

All organisms must communicate with their environment to survive. Bacterial cells monitor external conditions and process this information to give the most appropriate response. Two-component regulatory systems have emerged as a paradigm for adaptive responses. In its simplest form, a two-component system contains a sensor (histidine kinase) and a response regulator (often a transcriptional activator) (1Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Changes in the environment result in phosphorylation of the sensor followed by transphosphorylation onto the response regulator (1Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 2Fabret C. Feher V.A. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although kinase-response regulator pairs of this type were frequently reported as governors of a wide variety of pathways in response to a myriad of signals (3Bourret R. Borkovich K. Simon M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 401-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 4Stock J. Surette M. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J. Silhavy T. Two Component Signal Transduction.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar), the requirement of this system to control gene expression during cold-shock has only recently been discovered in Bacillus subtilis (6Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L.E. Erazo A.C. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and cyanobacteria (7Suzuki I. Los D.A. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Murata N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Cold shock is a stress condition that adversely affects the growth of poikilothermic organisms, such as bacteria and plants. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which these organisms perceive low temperature signals and transmit this information to the cellular machinery to activate adaptive responses is of fundamental importance to biology. Bacteria and most (if not all) poikilothermic organisms have to remodel the membrane lipid composition to survive at low temperatures. B. subtilis (6Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L.E. Erazo A.C. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and Synechocystis (7Suzuki I. Los D.A. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Murata N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) respond to a decrease in the ambient growth temperature by introducing double bonds into the acyl chains of their membrane phospholipids by membrane-bound acyl lipid desaturases. This post-synthetic modification of the saturated acyl chains seems to be designed to ameliorate the effect of temperature changes on the physical state of membrane phospholipids. In Synechocystis it was found that inactivation of two histidine kinases moderates the low-temperature induction of the genes coding for Δ6 and ω-3 desaturase (7Suzuki I. Los D.A. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Murata N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, the transcriptional regulators of these genes were not yet identified. A better understood example of perception and transduction of low temperature signals is the Des pathway of B. subtilis, which regulates the expression of the acyl lipid desaturase, Δ5-Des. This pathway responds to a decrease in growth temperature by enhancing the expression of the des gene coding for Δ5-Des (8Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Aguilar P.S. Lopez P. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7028-7033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Díaz A. Mansilla M.C.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3228-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The Des pathway is uniquely and stringently controlled by the two-component system, DesK/DesR (6Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L.E. Erazo A.C. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). DesK is a histidine kinase located in the membrane and DesR is a 22.18-kDa cytoplasmic response regulator that binds specifically to the promoter region it controls. Response regulators have been classified according to similarities in the DNA binding domain. DesR belongs to the NarL group, in which the C-terminal binding domain contains a helix-turn-helix motif (2Fabret C. Feher V.A. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the two-component system paradigm and on previous work, we have proposed that the two proteins communicate via a series of phosphorylation and phosphotransfer reactions. DesK senses a decrease in membrane lipid fluidity and is autophosphorylated by intracellular ATP at His-188 (12Cybulski L. Albanesi D. Mansilla M.C. Altabe S. de Mendoza D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Albanesi D. Mansilla M.C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that DesK-P is able to phosphorylate DesR (13Albanesi D. Mansilla M.C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) so we suggested that this covalent modification of DesR allows its interaction with the des regulatory region, leading to activation of des transcription. This assumption was based on the fact that no bacterial response regulator has yet been found to be active in the unphosphorylated form, although some response regulators, such as yeast SSK1 I, are inactive in the phosphorylated form (14Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Although genetic studies have shown that DesR is absolutely necessary for des expression, it is unknown whether DesR is able to stimulate transcription per se or it is required to stimulate the synthesis or activity of another factor necessary for des transcription. In the present study we have examined how phosphorylation influences the ability of DesR to bind to the des promoter (Pdes). 1The abbreviations used are: Pdes, des promoter; RNAP, RNA polymerase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Ac-P, acetyl phosphate; CI and CII, complexes I and II; RA and RB, regions A and B; DR, direct repeat. 1The abbreviations used are: Pdes, des promoter; RNAP, RNA polymerase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Ac-P, acetyl phosphate; CI and CII, complexes I and II; RA and RB, regions A and B; DR, direct repeat. Our results show that only the phosphorylated form of DesR, DesR-P, is able to bind to the regulatory region it controls. In addition, we demonstrate that DesR is a dimer in solution that tends to tetramerize upon phosphorylation, which could account for cooperative interaction between molecules of DesR-P bound at adjacent DesR regulatory binding sites at Pdes. We show that DesR-P activates des transcription through recruitment of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) to the des promoter. A model for DesR-P promoter recognition has emerged from our results that we discuss in the context of transcriptional regulation of membrane fluidity homeostasis. Bacterial Strains, Plasmid, and Strain Constructions—The bacterial strains used in this work are listed in Supplementary Materials Table I. β-Galactosidase was assayed as previously described (15Mansilla C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 76-981Crossref Google Scholar). To mutate the IR-L inverted repeat of the regions that were protected in footprinting experiments (Fig. 4), oligonucleotides I, II, III, and IV were used for the amplification of two overlap-extension PCR (see Supplementary Materials Table II). A mixture of these PCR products was used as DNA template for another PCR using oligonucleotides I and VII (16Horton R. Hunt H. Ho S. Pullen J. Pease L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). The 301-bp amplification product was cloned into the integrational vector pJM116 (17Dartois V. Dérbarbouillé F. Kunst F. Rapaport G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1855-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pLC118. To mutate IR-R, oligonucleotides V and VI were utilized instead of II and III, and the resulting plasmid was pLC119. These plasmids were introduced into the amyE locus of strain JH642 giving strains LC118 and LC119, respectively. The same strategy was used to mutate the putative phosphorylation site Asp-54 with Ala, using oligonucleotides VIII, IX, X, and XI. The amplification product was cloned into plasmid pGS791 2G. Schujman, personal communication. under the xylose promoter, yielding plasmid pLC90. This plasmid was integrated ectopically in the thrC locus of a B. subtilis strain that lacks DesR and contains a fusion of the lacZ reporter gene to the des promoter (AKP9, see Ref. 6Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L.E. Erazo A.C. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) yielding strain LC90. Wild type desR was amplified using oligonucleotides VIII and XI, and was cloned in the same way as desRD54A, giving strain LC89. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the introduction of mutations. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—DNA fragments including the wild type or different des promoter variants were prepared by PCR using primers XIII(PECO895) and VII(BAMO) (Supplementary Materials Table II). The assay was performed as described previously (6Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L.E. Erazo A.C. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated DesR was used in the reaction, 6 μm DesR was incubated for 20 min at 0 °C in a mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm acetyl phosphate. For the ternary complex formation, the DNA fragment was prepared using the primers XIV and XV (Supplementary Materials Table II). The RNAP Holoenzyme (Epicenter) was added at 100 nm and incubated 30 min at 25 °C before running the gel. When heparin was included in the reaction, it was added for 5 min, at 60 μg/ml, after the incubation with the RNAP. OH•Footprinting Assays—Hydroxyl radical treatment was performed essentially as described (18del Solar G.H. Pérez-Martin J. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12569-12575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical reaction mixture contained 2.6 nm 5′-end-labeled DNA fragment extending from –167 to +10 relative to the des transcription start site, DesR-P (300 or 1000 nm), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, and 200 ng of poly(dI-dC). After 30 min incubation at room temperature, 1 mm sodium ascorbate, H2O2 to 0.03%, and Fe(EDTA)2– (final concentrations of 18 and 36 μm for Fe(II) and Na2EDTA, respectively) were added, and the incubation was continued for 1 min at the same temperature. The reactions were stopped by the addition of a thiourea/EDTA solution (final concentrations of 9.5 mm thiourea and 1.7 mm EDTA). Mixes were run in a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was exposed to an autoradiographic film for 5 min, and complexes I and II were cut out of the gel. The DNA was eluted, precipitated, loaded on denaturing 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels, and run together with the products of sequencing reactions of Maxam and Gilbert (G + A) obtained from the same labeled DNA. The band pattern was visualized using a Fuji Film Phosphorimager. Separation of DesR from DesR-P—DesR or DesR phosphorylated in vitro with acetyl phosphate (Ac-P) for 20 min were injected on a C4 reversed phase Vydac column, using an ÄKTA Liquid chromatograph. Eluent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 20% acetonitrile in water; eluent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile in water. The sample was eluted with a gradient that varied from 80 to 0% A, over 40 min. Eluent B started at 20% and went to 100% over the same interval. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical ultracentrifugation studies were performed in a Beckman XL-A (Beckman Instruments Inc.) equipped with a UV-visible optic system inside the microcentrifuge. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 12,000 rpm and 20 °C in Epon eight-channel centerpieces with protein loading concentrations in the range of 1–12 μm. DesR was equilibrated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (and 50 mm Ac-P when indicated). Radial absorption scans at 231, 275, and 280 nm were taken after the sedimentation equilibrium was reached. Baseline offsets were determined by high-speed centrifugation (42,000 rpm). Experimental data were analyzed using the program Sednterp version 1.03 XLAEQ and EQASSOC (Beckman; 19Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C.

Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar), using a partial specific volume for DesR of 0.7449 ml g–1. This value was determined on the basis of its amino acid residue composition. The values of extinction coefficients at 280 nm were calculated from the known tryptophan and tyrosine residue contents. Determination of the Molecular Weight of DesR by Static Light Scattering—The average molecular weight (Mr) of wild type DesR and its mutant DesRD54A treated and non-treated with Ac-P were determined on a Precision Detector PD2010 light scattering instrument tandemly connected to an high performance liquid chromatography system and a LKB 2142 differential refractometer. The samples were loaded on a Sephadex G-25 (1 ml) column and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The 90° light scattering and refractive index signals of the eluting material were recorded on a PC computer and analyzed with the Discovery32 software supplied by Precision Detectors. The 90° light scattering detector was calibrated using bovine serum albumin (66.5 kDa) as a standard. In Vitro Transcription Assays—In vitro transcription reactions (50 μl) were performed in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 nm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. A DNA fragment extending from position –177 to position +43 was prepared by PCR using oligonucleotides PA and PC (Supplementary Table II). The DNA (5 nm) was incubated first with DesR-P (300 nm) for 20 min at 25 °C, and then 10 min with RNAP (0.2 units) at the same temperature. The mixture was then treated with 10 μg/ml heparin for 3 min at 37 °C. Reactions were started by the addition of 5 μl of a solution 2 m of the four NTPs containing 0.5 μm [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol; 10 μCi/μl). After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of sodium acetate, pH 7, to 300 mm, EDTA to 15 mm, and tRNA to 100 μg/μl, and the nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of 250 μl of 100% ethanol. The products were fractionated by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. Equation to Calculate the Relative Dissociation Constant of Regulator-DNA Complexes I and II—KdI and KdII represent the dissociation constants for specific complexes I and II, respectively. fmaxCI represents the fractional maximum level of complex I attained in the reactions (21Tsai S. Tsai M. O'Malley B. Cell. 1989; 57: 443-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). DNA+DesR⇄KdICI⇄KdII↘DesRCII(Eq. 1) KdIKdII=[1fmaxCI−1]2(Eq. 2) Phosphorylation of DesR Increases the Affinity of Binding to Its Target DNA—We wished to examine how phosphorylation influences the ability of DesR to bind to a DNA region spanning Pdes by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using DesR or DesR-P, this latter phosphorylated in vitro with Ac-P. To this end, a PCR-amplified [α-32P]dATP-labeled 216-bp DNA fragment extending from positions –187 to +29, relative to the des transcription start site, was incubated with purified DesR or DesR-P proteins. The results showed that Pdes exhibited changes in its electrophoretic mobility in the presence of either DesR (Fig. 1A) or DesR-P (Fig. 1B); however, when DesR-P was used, lower protein concentrations were sufficient to obtain the same fraction of complexed DNA. Phosphorylated DesR showed binding to the des promoter at concentrations as low as 0.06 μm. At this concentration a fast migrating complex I (CI) was mainly observed. Increasing DesR-P concentration enhanced progressively the formation of the slow-migrating complex II (CII; Fig. 1B). At 0.6 μm, CII is clearly the predominant protein-DNA complex. Formation of two different complexes, CI and CII, suggested to us the existence of two binding sites for the response regulator. DesR without Ac-P treatment was also able to bind to Pdes, but higher concentrations were needed to form CI and CII (Fig. 1A). DesR Phosphorylation Site Is Asp-54—Sequence comparative analysis of bacterial response regulators using multiple sequence alignment with hierarchical clustering (Multalin) indicated that Asp-54 of DesR should be the residue that receives the phosphoryl group from the cognate kinase, DesK. To determine whether this putative phosphorylation site, Asp-54, was involved in DesR activity, it was substituted with Ala using site-directed mutagenesis. DNA fragments carrying either desR+ (wild type) or desR encoding the mutant protein (desRD54A) were provided in trans into a desR null mutant carrying a fusion of the lacZ reporter gene to the des promoter. The expression of wild type desR+ allowed stimulation of des transcription upon a temperature downshift, whereas the expression of desRD54A could not stimulate transcription of the des-lacZ fusion under the same conditions (Supplemental Materials Fig. S1), indicating that residue Asp-54 is crucial for in vivo DesR transcriptional activity. Confirming this conclusion, we have determined that autophosphorylated DesK serves as a phosphodonor of the effector protein DesR, but cannot transfer the phosphoryl group to DesRD54A (data not shown). The Unphosphorylated Form of DesR Is Unable to Bind to the des Promoter—Some response regulators such as B. subtilis PhoP bind to its target promoters either in the unphosphorylated or in the phosphorylated form. However, the unphosphorylated form of PhoP is unable to activate transcription (22Liu W. Hulett M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6302-6310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, DesR binds to Pdes even without previous treatment with Ac-P, although in vivo experiments (described in Supplemental Materials Fig. S1) indicated that phosphorylation of Asp-54 is crucial for DesR activity. This suggested that DesR behaved similarly to PhoP. If this were the case, DesRD54A should bind to Pdes in EMSA, in the same way as unphosphorylated DesR, but treatment of DesRD54A with Ac-P should not increase its binding affinity. To evaluate this possibility, binding of purified DesRD54A to Pdes was tested using EMSA. Surprisingly, DesRD54A was unable to bind to Pdes at any tested concentration even when treated with Ac-P (Supplemental Materials Fig. S2A). This result could be attributed to: (i) the unphosphorylated form of DesR does not bind to Pdes, and the binding activity observed in the experiment shown in Fig. 1A was because of nonspecific phosphorylation of DesR during its overproduction in Escherichia coli, or (ii) the point mutation Asp-Ala in DesRD54A provoked a conformational change that abolished the binding of the mutated response regulator to Pdes. To distinguish between these two possibilities, DesR purified from E. coli was subjected to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Supplemental Materials Fig. S2B). DesR showed two peaks that correspond to the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated form of the regulator. When DesR extracted from E. coli was incubated with Ac-P, the peak corresponding to DesR-P increased considerably (Supplemental Materials Fig. S2C). This result indicates that about 50% of His-tagged DesR purified from E. coli is phosphorylated, and that this form could be responsible for the binding activity of DesR without Ac-P treatment in the EMSA assays showed in Fig. 1A. It is worth mentioning that circular dichroism analysis showed that DesRD54A presents the same global secondary structure as wild type DesR (Supplemental Materials Fig. S2D), supporting the conclusion that this mutant regulator does not bind to Pdes because it is unable to be phosphorylated in the conserved aspartate by Ac-P, rather than by a structural change produced by the mutation. To demonstrate directly that the unphosphorylated form of DesR does not bind to its target promoter, we took advantage of the observation that DesR-P is completely dephosphorylated after incubation at 25 °C for 12 h (13Albanesi D. Mansilla M.C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We tested by EMSA the retardation of Pdes in the presence of untreated DesR (as it elutes from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column), DesR dephosphorylated by incubation at 25 °C for 12 h, or DesR dephosphorylated at 25 °C and phosphorylated again by treatment with Ac-P. Fig. 2A shows that untreated DesR forms two complexes (lanes 2–4), whereas DesR dephosphorylated at 25 °C is unable to bind to Pdes (lanes 5–7). As expected, when this unphosphorylated DesR was incubated with Ac-P, it recovered the DNA binding activity (lanes 8–10). From now on, we will call “unphosphorylated DesR” the protein that was incubated 12 h at 25 °C. In addition, incubation of unphosphorylated DesR with increasing concentrations of Ac-P resulted in a similar enhancement of the binding of the response regulator, reaching a maximum at 50 mm of the phosphoryl donor (Fig. 2B). From the above results we can draw two conclusions: (i) the extent of phosphorylation of DesR determines its binding capacity, and (ii) unphosphorylated DesR is unable to bind to its target promoter. It should be mentioned that when DesRD54A was incubated with 50 mm Ac-P, and then subjected to high performance liquid chromatography, we detected that a secondary site(s) of the protein was phosphorylated (data not shown). Nevertheless, as shown in Supplemental Materials Fig. S2A, phosphorylation of this secondary site was unable to stimulate DesRD54A binding to Pdes. DesR Is a Dimer in Solution and Tetramerizes upon Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation promotes the formation of dimers or even oligomers of many response regulators; however, other response regulators do not change their association state upon phosphorylation (23Jeon Y.

Microbiol. 1999; 34: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The existence of two DesR-P·DNA complexes (Figs. 1 and 2) indicates that phosphorylation of DesR favors the binding of more than one subunit of the protein to the des promoter. To study the association state of DesR or DesR-P, we performed sedimentation equilibrium experiments by analytical ultracentrifugation. In the case of DesR-P it was necessary to define the required experimental conditions to stabilize the phosphorylated form during the course of the sedimentation assay. Because the half-life of DesR-P at 25 °C is about 90 min (13Albanesi D. Mansilla M.C. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a high steady state of phosphorylation was maintained in situ by the inclusion of an excess of Ac-P in the sample subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation. Ultracentrifugation runs were performed either with unphosphorylated DesR or with DesR-P at concentrations in the range of 1 to 12 μm. Unphosphorylated DesR behaved as a dimer in solution at every tested concentration, because all the experimental data fit the Sednterp predicted curve for a dimer (Supplemental Materials Fig. S3A). When DesR was subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation in the presence of Ac-P, its hydrodynamic behavior changed considerably, especially at the highest protein concentration, at which the tetramer became the most abundant species (Supplemental Materials Fig. S3B), although the best fit includes constants for higher order multimers. This suggests that phosphorylation of DesR promotes new interaction between DesR dimers. Plots of the buoyant molecular mass versus protein concentration (1–12 μm) indicated that at low protein concentrations, the molecular mass of DesR-P corresponded to a dimer (Supplemental Materials Fig. S3C). As the levels of DesR-P increased, the mass of the species became larger, reaching the mass of a tetramer. This is a characteristic behavior of a system in equilibrium; otherwise dilution would not affect the average molecular mass of the species. To confirm the hydrodynamic properties of DesR obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation and to investigate the tetramerization phenomenon in the absence of continuous phosphorylation by Ac-P, we resort to static light scattering experiments. To this end, solutions of unphosphorylated DesR or DesR incubated with Ac-P were dialyzed for 20 min to remove the phosphorylating agent. Then, the total scattered intensity at 90° was examined. The average molecular weight of DesR was 41,553, and that of DesR-P was 71,834, corresponding to 1.94 and 3.36 units of DesR, respectively. The latter fractional number suggested that in this condition phosphorylation with Ac-P does not reach completion, and that about 70% of DesR was phosphorylated on this sample. Control experiments with DesRD54A showed an average molecular weight corresponding to a dimer regardless of the Ac-P treatment. Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that DesR is a dimer in solution that mainly forms tetramers upon phosphorylation. High-resolution Contacts of DesR on Its Target—Previous DNase I footprinting assays have shown that DesR binds to a DNA sequence that extends from positions –28 to –77 relative to the des transcription start site, generating 5 protected regions on each strand (6Aguilar P.S.

Two inverted repeats (5′-TCAT-3′) separated by 9 nucleotides were found in the center of the protected region.

First, sortase A can be inhibited both in vivo and in vitro with thiolate reagents such as methylmethane thiosulfonate (e.g. MTSET) or para-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, but not with a sulfhydryl reagent such as iodoacetate or iodoacetamide (12Ton-That H.

Third, sortase A-mediated hydroxylaminolysis or cell wall anchoring of surface proteins in vivo requires Cys184 as well as His120, another charged residue that is conserved in all sortases (26Ton-That H.

Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of sortase A with or without bound substrate revealed that His120 is positioned at a distance (7 Å) from Cys184 (24Zong Y. Bice T.W. Ton-That H.

This measurement is not consistent with the formation of a thiolate-imidazolium ion bond as is known to occur in papain and papain-like cysteine proteases (28Drenth J. Jansonius J.N. KoeKoek R.

The three-dimensional structure of sortase A bound to the LPETG substrate revealed the presence of Arg197 on the β8-strand, in close proximity to Cys184 and to the scissile peptide bond (Fig. 1B). We show here that substitution of Arg197 with alanine, lysine or histidine severely reduced sortase A function, whereas Asn98 was found to be dispensable for catalysis. As the structural proximity of Arg197 and Cys184 is conserved in sortase enzymes (32Pallen M.J. Lam A.C. Antonio M. Dunbar K.

The sortase A mutant S. aureus strains SKM1 (pGL4), SKM1 (pGL4, pSrtA), and SKM1 (pGL4, pOS1) have also been previously described (9Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Jensen E.R. Lenoy E. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5510-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Mutant derivatives of the pSrtA plasmid were transformed into SKM1 (pGL4) and selected on tryptic soy agar supplemented with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 2.5 μg/ml tetracycline. pGL4, a pT181-type shuttle vector, provides for the expression of Seb-Spa490-524, a model surface protein substrate for analysis of the S. aureus cell wall sorting pathway (8Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Science. 1999; 285: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations in srtA, i.e. the sortase A gene, were generated by high fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using pSrtA or pHTT27 templates and Pfu polymerase (Invitrogen). The Arg197 codon was mutated to encode Ala197 using the primers R197A-T (CAGGCGTTTGGGAAAAAGCTAAAATCTTTGTAGCTAC) and R197A-B (GTAGCTACAAAGATTTTAGCTTTTTCCCAAACGCCTG), with lysine using the primers R197K-T (CAGGCGTTTGGGAAAAAAAGAAAATCTTTGTAGCTAC) and R197K-B (GTAGCTACAAAGATTTTCTTTTTTTCCCAAACGCCTG) or with histidine using the primers R197H-T (CAGGCGTTTGGGAAAAACATAAAATCTTTGTAGCTAC) and R197H-B (GTAGCTACAAAGATTTTATGTTTTTCCCAAACGCCTG). The double substitution variant, SrtA C184R/R197C, was assembled in two steps. First, the Cys184 codon was mutated to encode Arg184 with the primers C184R-T (CAATTAACATTAATTACTCGTGATGATTACAATGAAAAG) and C184R-B (CTTTTCATTGTAATCATCACGAGTAATTAATGTTAATTG). Then, the Arg197 codon was changed to encode Cys197 using plasmid template from the previous mutagenesis and the primers R197C-T (CAGGCGTTTGGGAAAAATGTAAAATCTTTGTAGCTAC) and R197C-B (GTAGCTACAAAGATTTTACATTTTTCCCAAACGCCTG). The Asn98 codon was mutated to encode Ala98 using the primers N98A-T (GCAACACCTGAACAATTAGCTAGAGGTGTAAGCTTTGC) and N98A-B (GCAAAGCTTACACCTCTAGCTAATTGTTCAGGTGTTGC) or Gln98 using the primers N98Q-T (GCAACACCTGAACAATTACAGAGAGGTGTAAGCTTTGC) and N98Q-B (GCAAAGCTTACACCTCTCTGTAATTGTTCAGGTGTTGC) (underlined nucleotides mark mutational changes). DpnI digestion of PCR amplification products was used to destroy methylated parental DNA; newly synthesized plasmid DNA encoding the mutant sequences was then transformed into bacteria. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of purified plasmid DNA. Pulse-chase Experiments—Staphylococcal cultures were grown overnight in tryptic soy broth media supplemented with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 2.5 μg/ml tetracycline at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were diluted into fresh media and grown until OD600 reached 0.5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and suspended in minimal medium lacking methionine and cysteine (14Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]Promix (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 min. After labeling, 50 μl of chase solution were added (100 mg/ml casamino acids, 10 mg/ml methionine) and at timed intervals (0, 2, and 10 min after the chase), 250 μl of cells were removed and transferred into an Eppendorf tube containing an equal volume of 15% trichloroacetic acid to quench all further processing of surface proteins. After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells and precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, washed in ice-cold acetone, sedimented again by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and then dried. Samples were suspended in 1 ml of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 and the peptidoglycan digested by adding either 150 μg mutanolysin or 100 μg of lysostaphin with incubation for 4 hours at 37 °C and intermittent mixing of samples. Digests were precipitated by the addition of 7.5% trichloroacetic acid and incubation on ice for 30 min. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, washed in ice-cold acetone, and then sedimented by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min and dried. Samples were solubilized by boiling in 50 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, pH 8.0. 40 μl aliquots were transferred to 1 ml of RIPA buffer containing 1 μl of rabbit α-Seb antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were captured on 100 μl of preswollen protein A CL 4B-Sepharose, washed five times with RIPA buffer, and solubilized by boiling in sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, dried, and analyzed by phosphorimager. Measuring Sortase Expression in Vivo—A 1-ml aliquot of staphylococci was grown in tryptic soy broth until an OD600 of 0.5. Bacteria and soluble proteins were sedimented by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 7.5% and incubated 30 min on ice. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold acetone, and again centrifuged. The sediment was suspended in sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with a rabbit α-sortase antibody. Hydroxylaminolysis of Surface Proteins in Vivo—Cells were grown and pulse-labeled for 1 min and chased for 5 min as described above, however this reaction was performed either in the presence or absence of 0.1 m NH2OH. A 0.5-ml aliquot was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was precipitated with 0.5 ml of 15% trichloroacetic acid. The remaining 0.5-ml culture aliquot was also precipitated but then suspended in 1 ml of 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 μg of lysostaphin to digest the peptidoglycan for 1 h at 37 °C. All four samples were treated with 7.5% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate soluble proteins. The sediment was washed in acetone, dried, and then boiled in 50 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, pH 8.0. 40-μl aliquots were immunoprecipitated with α-Seb as described above, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by phosphorimager. Purification and Characterization of Recombinant Sortases—E. coli XL-1 blue harboring plasmids that provide for the expression of SrtAΔN59 and wild-type or mutant sortases, were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an OD600 of 0.7. Gene expression was the induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cultures were grown for an additional 2 hours. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 × g, suspended in 30 ml of C buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5), and lysed in a French pressure cell at 14,000 psi. The extract was centrifuged at 29,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant applied to a 1.5-ml Ni-NTA resin pre-equilibrated with C buffer. The column was washed with 40 ml of C buffer, and bound protein was eluted in 4 ml of C buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. To characterize purified enzymes, the average mass of 1 μg of wild-type or mutant sortase was determined in an ion trap mass spectrometry instrument (Agilent 1100 LC/MSD XCT). The average observed mass of all enzymes was within the error rate (0.01%) of the calculated average masses. To exclude the possibility that the introduced mutations produced structurally unstable enzymes, mutant as well as wild-type sortases were subjected to circular dichroism. Buffer was changed to 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, and CD spectra from 260 to 190 nm were recorded with an AVIV 202 Circular Dichroism Spectrometer. In Vitro Analysis of Sortase Enzymes—Sortase activity was assayed in buffer R (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2) at 37 °C for 30 min. The Abz-LPETG-Dnp peptide was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the reaction at a final concentration of 5 μm. Purified SrtAΔN59 or its mutant variants were added to the reaction at a final concentration of 10 μm. Reactions were quenched by boiling samples for 5 min and peptide cleavage was monitored by fluorescence at 420 nm after excitation at 320 nm. The mean and standard deviation of three independent measurements are reported. Initial velocity assays were carried out under the same conditions and reaction rates were determined by monitoring fluorescence over 100 s or 2-h time periods. The average of three independent experiments is reported. Kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant enzymes were measured in the conditions above detailed, varying the concentration of Abz-LPETG-Dpn substrate in a range from 5 to 160 μm and at a constant concentration sortase of 5 μm. The fluorescence increment detected was used to calculate the initial velocity as previously reported (13Ton-That H. Mazmanian H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9876-9881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Average and error of three independent measures were used to obtain Vmax and Km values from Lineweaver Burk plots (34Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985Google Scholar). HPLC Purification of Cleaved Products—A reaction containing 10 μm Abz-LPETG-Dnp and 15 μm recombinant enzyme in a final volume of 1 ml of buffer R (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2) was incubated either in the presence or absence of 5 mm of triglycine at 37 °C for 16 h. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation in a Centricon-10 unit (Millipore) at 7,500 × g to separate enzyme from substrate and products. The filtrate was subjected to RP-HPLC separation on C-18 column (2 × 250-mm, C18 Hypersil, Keystone Scientific). Elution of cleaved products was monitored at 215 nm, and 1-min fractions were collected. Vacuum dried fractions were stored at 4 °C for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analysis (ABI 4700, operated in reflection mode) to verify the structure of transpeptidation products. Arg197 Substitutions in Sortase A Interfere with S. aureus Surface Protein Anchoring in Vivo—Plasmids encoding either wild-type srtA or srtA variants with nucleotide substitutions in codon 197 were generated with site-directed mutagenesis. Four plasmids were transformed into S. aureus strain SKM1 [Δ(srtA)]: pSrtA, encoding the wild-type srtA gene; pLMR197A, encoding an R197A substitution; pLM-R197K; encoding an R197K substitution; and pLM-R197H, encoding an R197H substitution. As a control for adequate expression of sortase genes, cell extracts from equal numbers of staphylococci were analyzed for sortase expression by immunoblotting with α-SrtA (Fig. 2). To measure surface protein anchoring, staphylococci were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 2 min, followed by the addition of an excess of non-radioactive methionine and cysteine to quench the incorporation of all radio-labeled amino acids into polypeptides. During the pulse (0 min) or 2 and 10 min after the addition of the chase, all surface protein processing was quenched by the addition of 7.5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The cell wall envelope of staphylococci was digested with lysostaphin, a glycyl-glycine endopeptidase that cuts the anchor structure of surface proteins at the pentaglycine cell wall cross-bridge (35Schindler C.A. Schuhardt V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and Seb-Spa490-524 surface protein was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal α-Seb and protein A-Sepharose, followed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimager analysis (15Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar)(Fig. 2). When analyzed for S. aureus strain SKM1 harboring pSrtA (9Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Jensen E.R. Lenoy E. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5510-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), Seb-Spa490-524 was synthesized as a P1 precursor carrying both an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal sorting signal. P1 precrusor was rapidly cleaved to generate first the P2 precursor, lacking the signal peptide but still bearing the sorting signal, and then the mature cell wall anchored product without signal peptide and sorting signal (Fig. 2A). Ten minutes after the addition of the chase, essentially all Seb-Spa490-524 was processed to the mature anchored surface protein species. Treatment of the envelope of S. aureus SKM1 (pSrtA) with muramidase, an enzyme that cuts MurNAc-(β1-4)-GlcNAc glycosidic bonds of peptidoglycan (36Yokogawa K. Kawata S. Nishimura S. Ikeda Y. Yoshimura Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1974; 6: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), released Seb-Spa490-524 as a spectrum of polypeptides with linked cell wall fragments of variable mass (Fig. 2A). Transformation of S. aureus strain SKM1 [Δ(srtA)] with empty vector pOS1 did not restore the sorting defect of the parent strain, as pulse-labeled staphylococci accumulated P2 precursor. Furthermore, lysos"
https://openalex.org/W2056556818,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest and most diverse family of cell surface receptors. Several GPCRs have been documented to dimerize with resulting changes in pharmacology. We have previously reported by means of photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer (pbFRET) microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopic (FCS) analysis in live cells, that human somatostatin receptor (hSSTR) 5 could both homodimerize and heterodimerize with hSSTR1 in the presence of the agonist SST-14. In contrast, hSSTR1 remained monomeric when expressed alone regardless of agonist exposure in live cells. In an effort to elucidate the role of ligand and receptor subtypes in heterodimerization, we have employed both pb-FRET microscopy and Western blot on cells stably co-expressing hSSTR1 and hSSTR5 treated with subtype-specific agonists. Here we provide evidence that activation of hSSTR5 but not hSSTR1 is necessary for heterodimeric assembly. This property was also reflected in signaling as shown by increases in adenylyl cyclase coupling efficiencies. Furthermore, receptor C-tail chimeras allowed for the identification of the C-tail as a determinant for dimerization. Finally, we demonstrate that heterodimerization is subtype-selective involving ligand-induced conformational changes in hSSTR5 but not hSSTR1 and could be attributed to molecular events occurring at the C-tail.

Although the mechanism by which GPCR dimerization occurs remains obscure, one model suggests that ligand binding of cell surface receptors induces a conformational change that favors dimer formation; while the other suggests that dimerization is an exclusive event occurring early on during receptor biogenesis most probably in the ER and is a necessary event for proper receptor trafficking and function. This latter model has been suggested for members of the class C subfamily of GPCRs, which include the GABAergic receptors (7White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A.

However, it remains unclear as to whether one or both receptor subtypes are capable of promoting heterodimerization, and which receptor motifs may be attributed to this behavior. In the present study, using subtype-specific agonists and both photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer (pbFRET) and Western blot analysis, we demonstrate that ligand-bound hSSTR5 but not hSSTR1 can promote the heterodimerization of hSSTR1/hSSTR5. Moreover, using receptor C-tail chimeras, we were able to abrogate the homodimerization of hSSTR5 and induce the formation of hSSTR1 homodimers. The hSSTR5 subtype-specific analog of somatostatin, SMS 201-995, displayed a relatively poor signaling profile for hSSTR5 expressed alone despite having nanomolar binding affinity. Accordingly, co-expression with hSSTR1 resulted in a robust signaling efficiency by SMS 201-995 that correlated in part with its ability to induce heterodimerization. Finally, we demonstrate that not all agonists can induce heterodimerization, which was dependent upon ligand occupancy of a specific receptor subtype that can lead to alterations in pharmacology.

Chimeric receptors R1CR5 and R5CR1 were constructed by interchanging the C-tail of each receptor with one another. R1CR5 was created by adding the C-tail of hSSTR5, the last 46 residues, to hSSTR1 after residue 331. Similarly, R5CR1 includes the remaining 60 residues of hSSTR1 joined to hSSTR5 following residue 318 (31Hukovic N. Rocheville M. Kumar U. Sasi R. Khare S. Patel Y.C. J. Biol.

The reaction of the dye with the ligand was performed in 0.2 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.5for 4 h at 4 °C in the absence of light. The reaction was stopped with 1.5 m hydroxylamine followed by HPLC separation as previously described (32Nouel D. Gaudriault G. Houle M. Reisine T. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Beaudet A.

Binding studies were performed with 20–40 μg of membrane protein collected from CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the receptor constructs, and 125I-labeled LTT-SST-28 radioligand (∼60 pm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% bacitracin (binding buffer) for 30 min at 37 °C. Incubations were terminated by the addition of ice-cold binding buffer. Membrane pellets were quantified for radioactivity using a LKB gamma counter (LKB-Wallach, Turku, Finland). Binding data were analyzed with Prism 3.0 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA) by non-linear regression analysis. Coupling to Adenylyl Cyclase—Cells were grown in 6-multiwell plates and tested for receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase by incubation for 30 min with 20 μm forskolin and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine with or without agonists (10–11–10–6m) at 37 °C as previously described (31Hukovic N.

The effective FRET efficiency (E) was calculated in terms of a percent based upon the photobleaching (pb) time constants of the donor taken in the absence (D–A) and presence (D + A) of acceptor according to E = 1 – (τD – A/τD+A) × 100. CHO-K1 cells expressing HA-hSSTR5 and hSSTR1 were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h, treated with different concentrations of agonist for 15 min at 37 °C and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min on ice and processed for immunocytochemistry. Antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody conjugated to Rhodamine directed to HA-hSSTR5 and rabbit primary antibody followed by secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to fluorescein-directed to hSSTR1. pbFRET in CHO-K1 cells expressing hSSTR1, hSSTR5 and the chimera receptors was performed using fluorescently labeled SST ligands. Cells were grown on coverslips as mentioned above, treated with either 20 nm SST-FITC or 20 nm SST-FITC and 20 nm SST-TR. Both reactions, either antibody or ligand resulted in specific staining at the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane region was used to analyze the photobleaching decay on a pixel-by-pixel basis as described earlier (13Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Sasi R. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. J. Biol.

Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—Membranes from HA-hSSTR1, HA-SSTR5, and HA-hSSTR1/c-Myc-hSSTR5 stably transfected in HEK-293 cells were prepared using a glass homogenizer in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5 as previously described (13Rocheville M.

The membrane pellet was washed and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 in the absence of dithiothreitol. Membrane protein (300 μg) was treated with SST-14 (0 and 10–6m) in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following treatment membrane protein was solubilized in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.0) for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged, and lysate was collected and incubated with 1 μg of anti-HA antibody overnight at 4 °C. Antibody was immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer before being solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 710 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad). The sample was heated at 85 °C for 5 min before being fractionated by electrophoresis on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The fractionated proteins were transferred by electrophoresis to a 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-Blot Transfer Medium, Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Membrane was blotted with anti-HA antibody (dilution 1:5000) for detection of HA-hSSTR1 and HA-hSSTR5 from single expressions, and anti-c-Myc antibody (1:5000) for detection of c-Myc-hSSTR5 from co-expressions. Blocking of membrane, incubation of primary antibodies, incubation of secondary antibodies, and detection by chemiluminescence were performed following WesternBreeze® (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to manufacturer's instructions. Images were captured using an Alpha Innotech FluorChem 8800 (Alpha Innotech Co., San Leandro, CA) gel box imager and densitometry was carried out using FluorChem software (Alpha Innotech Co.). Ligand-dependent Heterodimerization of hSSTR1 and hSSTR5 by pbFRET—To study the heterodimerization of hSSTRs, we stably expressed hSSTR5 with an N-terminal HA tag and wild-type hSSTR1 in CHO-K1 cells (Bmax 395 ± 12 fmol/mg of protein; KD, 2.3 ± 0.1 nm). Cells were treated with various concentrations of the agonists: SST-14, SST-28, endogenous agonists for both the receptors, SCH-275 (subtype-agonist for hSSTR1) and SMS 201-995 (subtype-agonist for hSSTR5) for 15 min. Treatment was terminated by putting the cells on ice, washing once with phosphate-buffered saline followed by fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. To determine the physical association between the two receptors, we performed pbFRET microscopy on the cells by using a primary antibody followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein (donor) to hSSTR1 and an anti-HA monoclonal antibody conjugated with rhodamine (acceptor) to hSSTR5. A panel of images depicting the co-expression of both receptor subtypes within the same cell is shown in Fig. 1. The decrease in donor fluorescence intensity due to photobleaching during prolonged exposure to excitation light was monitored in the absence and presence of acceptor fluorophore. Delays in the photobleaching decay of the donor in the presence of the acceptor related to an increase in FRET efficiency. Because FRET occurs at distances between 10–100 Å, it is a direct measure of protein-protein interaction. By taking a series of digital photographs, we analyzed the photobleaching decay of the donor on the surface of cell membranes on a pixel-by-pixel basis (Fig. 1, B and C). Cells were treated with different concentrations of four agonists, which displayed differences in their ability to induce heterodimerization. As shown in Fig. 2, in absence of agonist, a low relative FRET efficiency (<3%) was present in each condition. Treatment of SST-14 resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in heterodimer formation as indicated by increases in FRET efficiency. A maximum of 13.0 ± 1.1% at 10–6m was achieved possibly suggesting a saturation in the response (EC50 of 3.4 ± 2.1 nm) (Fig. 2A). A similar phenomenon was observed for SST-28, which also induced a concentration-dependent increase in FRET efficiency however with greater efficacy (EC50 0.14 ± 0.04 nm) (Fig. 2B). This may indicate that SST-28 is a more potent agonist at inducing heterodimerization than is SST-14. The hSSTR5 subtype agonist SMS 201-995, although capable of promoting heterodimerization, did so at much higher concentrations as determined by its EC50 value (EC50 119 ± 16 nm) (Fig. 2C). One possible explanation for this event could be that SMS 201-995 favors the formation of hSSTR5 homodimers than heterodimers; however, further studies are required. In contrast, treatment with the hSSTR1 subtype agonist SCH-275, did not result in significant increases in FRET efficiency (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that hSSTR1 is unable to promote heterodimerization. To further illustrate the active contribution of hSSTR5 in heterodimerization, we performed Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation on membranes prepared from cells either individually or co-expressing the two receptors.Fig. 2Concentration-dependent increase in effective FRET efficiencies from CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HA-hSSTR5 and hSSTR1 by different agonists. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of each agonist and analyzed by pbFRET microscopy. The calculated FRET efficiencies (%) and EC50 values for each agonist (A) SST-14 (3.4 ± 2.1 nm), (B) SST-28 (0.14 ± 0.04 nm), (C) SMS 201-995 (119 ± 16 nm) were plotted and analyzed by a sigmoidal dose-response equation using Graph Pad Prism 3.0. D, treatment with SCH-275 did not result in a significant increase in FRET efficiency. Data were analyzed by ANOVA, posthoc Dunnett's and compared with basal conditions without treatment.

In the absence of SST-14, hSSTR5 was found mainly as a monomer (∼55 kDa) (Fig. 3). Treatment with SST-14 resulted in the formation of dimers (∼110 kDa) including higher order oligomers (Fig. 3). A similar phenomenon was reported for hSSTR5 transfected in CHO-K1 cells, whereby agonist induced the dimerization of the receptor (13Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Sasi R. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7862-7869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Unlike hSSTR5, hSSTR1 did not form dimers in response to agonist nor was it self-associated under basal conditions (Fig. 3). This is in agreement with a previous report on hSSTR1 showing that it remained monomeric even in the presence of agonist in live cells using FCS (14Patel R.C. Kumar U. Lamb D.C. Eid J.S. Rocheville M. Grant M. Rani A. Hazlett T. Patel S.C. Gratton E. Patel Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3294-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of membranes expressing both receptor subtypes resulted in the detection of a weak band in the absence of agonist, however, upon agonist stimulation a strong signal was detected (∼115 kDa) indicating heterodimeric interaction (Fig. 3). Taken together these results and those obtained by pbFRET (Fig. 2), suggest that hSSTR1 is not actively involved in heterodimeric assembly. Membrane Binding Analysis of the hSSTR1 and hSSTR5 Heterodimer—To determine whether heterodimerization altered the binding properties of the receptors, we compared the binding constants for each agonist. Membranes were collected from CHO-K1 cells stably expressing hSSTR1, hSSTR5, and from cells co-expressing the two receptors. Saturation analysis with the radioligand 125I-LTT-SST-28 gave a Bmax of 415 ± 14 fmol/mg of protein and a KD of 0.49 ± 0.08 nm from membranes of the co-transfectants and Bmax and KD values of 284 ± 5 fmol/mg, 1.4 ± 0.05 nm and 231 ± 25 fmol/mg, 1.1 ± 0.15 nm for membranes transfected with hSSTR5 and hSSTR1 respectively. Binding constants represented as Ki values for each of the four agonists from each receptor species are shown in Table I. Heteromeric assembly of hSSTR1/hSSTR5 did not result in changes in the Ki values for SST-14 as determined by the lack of statistical significance when compared with the individual receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2079694375,"We show that a novel PTEN-like phosphatase (PLIP) exhibits a unique preference for phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI(5)P) as a substrate in vitro. PI(5)P is the least characterized member of the phosphoinositide (PI) family of lipid signaling molecules. Recent studies suggest a role for PI(5)P in a variety of cellular events, such as tumor suppression, and in response to bacterial invasion. Determining the means by which PI(5)P levels are regulated is therefore key to understanding these cellular processes. PLIP is highly enriched in testis tissue and, similar to other PI phosphatases, exhibits poor activity against several proteinaceous substrates. Despite a recent report suggesting a role for PI(5)P in the regulation of Akt, the overexpression of wild-type or catalytically inactive PLIP in Chinese hamster ovary-insulin receptor cells or a dsRNA-mediated knockdown of PLIP mRNA levels in Drosophila S2 cells does not alter Akt activity or phosphorylation. The unique in vitro catalytic activity and detailed biochemical and kinetic analyses reported here will be of great value in our continued efforts to identify in vivo substrate(s) for this highly conserved phosphatase."

Although most cleavages in hepatitis C virus polyprotein precursor proceed to completion during or immediately after translation, the cleavages mediated by a host cell signal peptidase are partial at the E2/p7 and p7/NS2 sites, leading to the production of an E2p7NS2 precursor. The sequences located immediately N-terminally of E2/p7 and p7/NS2 cleavage sites can function as signal peptides. When fused to a reporter protein, the signal peptides of p7 and NS2 were efficiently cleaved. However, when full-length p7 was fused to the reporter protein, partial cleavage was observed, indicating that a sequence located N-terminally of the signal peptide reduces the efficiency of p7/NS2 cleavage. Sequence analyses and mutagenesis studies have also identified structural determinants responsible for the partial cleavage at both the E2/p7 and p7/NS2 sites.

Whatever the structure and replication strategy of their genomes, all viruses must express their genes as functional messenger RNAs early in infection to direct the translational machinery of the cell to make viral proteins. Although each messenger RNA generally operates as a single translation unit in eukaryotes, RNA viruses have evolved various strategies to derive several separate protein products from a single genome. One of these strategies is to produce large polyprotein precursors that are processed by proteolytic cleavages to derive their final protein products. This is generally the case for positive strand RNA viruses. A consequence of this strategy is that regulation of the level and/or the kinetics of expression of individual proteins often has to occur post-translationally. Delayed processing and/or partial cleavage leading to the production of precursors are potential strategies to regulate the expression of final products. This has been well illustrated in the case of flavivirus polyprotein where the proteolytic processing at the C-prM junction involves coordinated cleavages at the cytoplasmic and luminal sides of the internal signal sequence (1Stocks C.E. Lobigs M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2141-2149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The study of the mechanisms leading to delayed and/or partial processing of polyprotein precursors is essential to better understand the replication of these viruses as well as to develop new antiviral strategies. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 1The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; PFU, plaque-forming unit. is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide (2Major M.E. Rehermann B. Feinstone S.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 1127-1162Google Scholar). HCV is a small positive strand enveloped virus that belongs to the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family (see Ref. 3Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 991-1042Google Scholar for a recent review). Its genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor of just over 3000 amino acid residues. This polyprotein precursor is co- and post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases to yield the mature structural and nonstructural proteins C, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (see Fig. 1) (4Dubuisson J.

The structural proteins of HCV, the capsid protein (C) and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2, are the components of the viral particle. The p7 polypeptide has been shown to be an ion channel protein (5Pavlovic D. Neville D.C. Argaud O. Blumberg B. Dwek R.A. Fischer W.B. Zitzmann N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to its involvement in NS2–3 processing, the role of NS2 in the HCV life cycle has not been determined yet. The other nonstructural proteins, NS3 to NS5B, are involved in other steps of the virus life cycle, e.g. for HCV genome replication (10Penin F. Dubuisson J. Rey F.A. Moradpour D. Pawlotsky J.M. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the HCV polypeptides are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or ER-derived membranes (for review see Ref. 4Dubuisson J. Penin F. Moradpour D. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 517-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting that genome replication and assembly occur in association with this compartment. The structural proteins are released from the polyprotein by host ER signal peptidase(s) (reviewed in Ref. 11Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Further processing mediated by a signal peptide peptidase occurs at the C terminus of the capsid protein (12McLauchlan J.

The cleavage between p7 and NS2 is also mediated by a cellular signal peptidase (13Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Asabe S.-I. Hirota M. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J.

The nonstructural proteins, i.e. NS2 to NS5B, are released from the polyprotein after cleavage by HCV proteases NS2–3 and NS3–4A (reviewed in Ref. 11Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Although most cleavages in the polyprotein precursor proceed to completion during or immediately after translation, partial cleavages at the E2/p7 and p7/NS2 sites lead to the production of an uncleaved E2p7NS2 molecule (13Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Asabe S.-I. Hirota M. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6215-6222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lin C. Lindenbach B.D. Pragai B.M. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 778-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of NS2 is progressively cleaved from the E2p7NS2 precursor, whereas at least for most of the HCV strains analyzed, the cleavage between E2 and p7 does not change over time (18Dubuisson J. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to the production of E2, E2p7, p7, and NS2. In this study, we analyzed the structural constraints leading to the partial/delayed cleavage of E2p7NS2 precursor. Sequence analyses and mutagenesis studies have identified structural determinants responsible for the partial cleavage at both E2/p7 and p7/NS2 sites. The p7 sequence located N-terminally of the signal peptide of NS2 was also shown to reduce the cleavage efficiency at the p7/NS2 site. Finally, insertion of a linker polypeptide sequence between P-3′ and P-4′ of the cleavage sites also improved cleavage efficiency, suggesting that additional constraints originate from structural elements located at the P′ side of the scissile bond. These various structural constraints and their release likely regulate the kinetics and/or the level of expression of p7 as well as NS2 and E2 mature proteins. Sequence Analyses and Structure Predictions—All of the analyses were made using the Institut de Biologie et Chemie des Protéines HCV data base website facilities (hepatitis.ibcp.fr; (19Combet C. Penin F. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Appl. Bioinformatics. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)). The HCV H strain consensus cDNA (20Kolykhalov A.A. Agapov E.V. Blight K. Mihalik K. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. Science. 1997; 277: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number AF009606) was used to retrieve the E2, p7, and NS2 sequences of all reported isolates from the EMBL data base using the FASTA homology search program (21Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments and amino acid conservation were carried out with the CLUSTAL W program (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of proteins was predicted using a large set of methods available at the Network Protein Sequence Analysis website (23Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar), including DSC, HNNC, SIMPA96, SOPM, GOR4, PHD, and Predator (npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/ NPSA and references therein). Various methods (TransMembrane prediction using the hidden Markov model, PHDhtm, TopPred2, and the dense alignment surface method) were combined for the prediction of transmembrane sequences as detailed previously (see Ref. 24Carrère-Kremer S. Montpellier-Pala C. Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3720-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar and the web sites and references therein). Plasmid Constructs—HCV sequences were amplified from clones derived from the H strain and cloned into the pTM1 vector as described previously (25Fournillier-Jacob A. Cahour A. Escriou N. Girard M. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The pTM1 plasmid contains a polycloning region immediately downstream of the T7 promoter and the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site cap-independent translation initiation (26Moss B.

Plasmids pTM1/E2E1, pTM1/Spp7E1, and pTM1/SpNS2E1 have been described previously (24Carrère-Kremer S. Montpellier-Pala C. Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2893-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTM1/CE1E2p7NS2Myc contains the sequence of a truncated HCV polyprotein including C, E1, E2, p7, and NS2. In addition, the sequence of a linker containing three glycine residues followed by a Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) has been added at the C terminus of NS2 to facilitate the detection of this protein. Plasmid pTM1/E2p7NS2Myc contains the sequence of a truncated HCV polyprotein including E2 with its signal peptide, p7, and NS2 tagged at its C terminus with a Myc epitope. Plasmid pTM1/E2p7E1 contains the sequence of E2 with its signal peptide and p7 in fusion with E1. Plasmid pTM1/p7E1 contains the sequence of p7 with its signal peptide in fusion with E1. Plasmids pTM1/SpCD4p7Myc and pTM1/SpCD4NS2Myc contain the sequence of the signal peptide of CD4 (MNRGVPFRHLLLVLQLALLPAAT) in fusion with p7Myc and NS2Myc, respectively. Plasmid pTM1/p7Myc contains the sequence of p7 tagged with the Myc epitope at its C terminus. Plasmids pTM1/E2†p7NS2Myc and pTM1/E2p7†NS2Myc contain the sequence of a truncated HCV polyprotein E2p7NS2Myc in which the signal peptidase cleavage site has been abolished at E2/p7 and p7/NS2, respectively. This has been obtained by replacing the C-terminal residue of E2 (pTM1/E2†p7NS2Myc) or p7 (pTM1/E2p7†NS2Myc) by an Arg. Plasmids pTM1/E2Tp7NS2Myc, pTM1/E2p7PNS2Myc, and pTM1/E2Tp7PNS2Myc contain the sequence of a truncated HCV polyprotein E2p7NS2Myc with a Thr residue inserted at position two of the p7 polypeptide, a Pro residue inserted at position three in NS2, or both mutations, respectively (see Table I). Plasmids pTM1/E2HAp7NS2Myc and pTM1/E2p7HANS2Myc derive from plasmid pTM1/E2p7NS2Myc with a HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) surrounded by three glycine residues, inserted after the third amino acid of p7 or NS2, respectively (see Table I).Table ISequences of the constructs at the junctions of the cleavage sites Open table in a new tab Cell Culture—The HepG2, CV-1, and 143B (thymidine kinase-deficient) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

The genes of HCV proteins expressed in this work are under the control of a T7 promoter, and expression of the proteins of interest is achieved either by co-infection of vTF7–3 with the appropriate vaccinia virus recombinant or by infection with vTF7–3 followed by transfection with the appropriate pTM1 plasmid.

The polyclonal anti-NS2 (15Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by C. M. Rice. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Endoglycosidase Digestions—For protein expression, HepG2 cells were either co-infected with vTF7–3 and the appropriate vaccinia virus recombinant or infected with vTF7–3 followed by transfection with the appropriate pTM1 plasmid by using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). Cells expressing recombinant proteins were metabolically labeled with 35S-protein labeling mix (530 MBq/ml; Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (16Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.G. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal), and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (17Dubuisson J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 778-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of proteins immunoprecipitated were determined by phosphorimaging and normalized relative to their methionine and cysteine content. For endoglycosidase digestion, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose in 30 μl of dissociation buffer (0.5% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) by boiling for 10 min. The protein samples were then divided into equal portions for digestion with either endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) or left untreated (control). The digestions were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C in the buffer provided by the manufacturer. Digested samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Sequence Analyses in the Regions of E2/p7 and p7/NS2 Cleavage Sites—Based on the hydrophobicity of the regions located just N-terminally of the cleavage sites, the dependence of cleavage of the polyprotein on the presence of membranes, and mutagenesis of cleavage sites into suboptimal substrates for signal peptidase, it has been shown that signal peptidases are involved in E2/p7 and p7/NS2 cleavages (reviewed in Ref. 11Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Indeed, the C termini of E2 and p7 contain a sequence for reinitiation of translocation, and when fused to a reporter protein, these sequences function as signal peptides (24Carrère-Kremer S. Montpellier-Pala C. Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3720-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28Cocquerel L. Op de Beeck A. Lambot M. Roussel J. Delgrange D. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2893-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For this reason, the translocation reinitiation sequence, which is present at the C terminus of E2, has been named the signal peptide of p7 (Spp7) (Fig. 1). Similarly, the C-terminal hydrophobic stretch of p7 has been named the signal peptide of NS2 (SpNS2). Cleavage at the E2/p7 and the p7/NS2 sites is partial or delayed, producing an E2p7NS2 precursor (13Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Asabe S.-I. Hirota M. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6215-6222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lin C. Lindenbach B.D. Pragai B.M. McCourt D.W. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5063-5073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.G. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dubuisson J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 778-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we were interested in identifying the structural features responsible for the partial/delayed cleavage of E2p7NS2 precursor. All of the secondary structure prediction methods tested indicate that the region of E2/p7 cleavage site might adopt an α-helical fold (Fig. 2). In addition, a coiled-coil structure including the E2/p7 site is slightly predicted by the method of Lupas et al. (34Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) (data not shown), indicating again that this region exhibits a strong propensity to adopt a well folded structure. The p7/NS2 cleavage site region is also predicted to fold into α-helix (Fig. 2), suggesting that it might also be involved in a well structured element. In summary, both E2/p7 and p7/NS2 cleavage site regions show a clear propensity to be well structured, possibly into α-helices. Such structuring, which is probably dependent on other structural elements of HCV polyprotein sequence and/or interaction with the membrane lipids, might potentially be responsible for the inefficiency of signal peptidase cleavage. Analyses of E2/p7 and p7/NS2 Cleavages in the Context of an E2p7NS2 Polyprotein—Because it is not easy to analyze E2/p7 and p7/NS2 cleavages by mutagenesis in the context of the full-length HCV polyprotein, we used an E2p7NS2 polyprotein to characterize these cleavages. To verify whether sequences located N- and C-terminally of E2p7NS2 do not dramatically affect E2/p7 and p7/NS2 cleavages, the processing of the E2p7NS2 polyprotein was compared with those of the full-length polyprotein or a polyprotein truncated after NS2. To facilitate its detection, NS2 was tagged at its C terminus with a Myc epitope. The polyproteins were expressed by infecting HepG2 cells with vaccinia virus recombinants followed by metabolic labeling. The products of E2p7NS2 processing were immunoprecipitated with anti-E2, anti-NS2, or anti-Myc antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3, an uncleaved E2p7NS2 polyprotein was detected with all of the corresponding specific antibodies whether expressed in the context of a truncated or full-length polyprotein. Some NS2 (Fig. 3, anti-NS2) and E2 (Fig. 3, anti-E2) were also produced in cells expressing the different polyproteins, indicating that cleavage of E2p7NS2 precursor occurs similarly whether or not sequences located N- and/or C-terminally are co-expressed. However, processing was slightly less efficient in the context of the E2p7NS2Myc polyprotein. Because E1 is known to interact with E2 (35Op De Beeck A. Montserret R. Duvet S. Cocquerel L. Cacan R. Barberot B. Le Maire M. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31428-31437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one cannot exclude that this interaction slightly improves downstream cleavages. A faint band corresponding to p7NS2Myc was also detected with the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3, anti-Myc). The p7NS2 and p7NS2Myc polypeptides were barely detectable with the anti-NS2 antibody. This seems to be due to the lower affinity of the latter antibody. As previously observed (15Grakoui A. Wychowski C. Lin C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.G. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the band with the size of E2 detected with the anti-E2 antibody corresponds to a mixture of E2 and E2p7 as demonstrated after deglycosylation by endo H treatment (data not shown). Unfortunately, because of the lack of specific antibody, the mature p7 polypeptide could not be directly visualized in our experiments. A faint band corresponding to E2 and E2p7 was also detected by immunoprecipitation with the anti-NS2 and the anti-Myc antibodies. This is due to disulfide bond association of E2p7NS2 and/or NS2 with E2. E2 has indeed a tendency to aggregate with itself (36Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), with E1 (16Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.G. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as with NS2 (37Selby M.J. Glazer E. Masiarz F. Houghton M. Virology. 1994; 204: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), 2J. Dubuisson, unpublished data. and tends to carry them upon immunoprecipitation with anti-E2 antibody. Two additional faint bands migrating between the 30- and 46-kDa molecular mass markers were also detected for HCV polyprotein with the anti-E2 and anti-NS2 antibodies. They correspond to nonspecific precipitates as determined with a control lysate that did not express HCV proteins (data not shown). Although the processing of the E2p7NS2 precursor seems to be slightly more efficient in the context of the full-length HCV polyprotein, our data indicate that it is not dramatically influenced by sequences located N- and C-terminally on the polyprotein. Together, these data show that the processing at the E2/p7 and p7/NS2 sites can be analyzed in the context of an E2p7NS2 polyprotein. Processing Occurs Independently at E2/p7 and p7/NS2 Cleavage Sites—Because the E2/p7 and p7/NS2 cleavage sites are relatively close to each other (63 amino acids), we wondered whether cleavage at one of these sites might be dependent on the cleavage of the other site. To determine whether these cleavages are interdependent or not, we chose to block one of the cleavage sites and analyzed the efficiency of processing of the unmodified site. To abolish the signal sequence cleavage between E2 and p7 or between p7 and NS2, the residue at position P1 of the cleavage site was mutated from Ala to Arg in the context of E2p7NS2Myc (Table I, E2†p7 and p7†NS2). This mutation is known to abolish signal peptide cleavage (38von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Processing of the mutated proteins was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of the precursor protein and its cleaved products with the anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, none of the mutations blocked the other cleavage site. Indeed, a NS2Myc protein was detected when the E2/p7 cleavage site was abolished (Fig. 4, E2†p7NS2Myc). Similarly, a p7NS2Myc polypeptide was observed when the p7/NS2 cleavage site was abolished (Fig. 4, E2p7†NS2Myc). Together, these observations indicate that processing can occur independently at E2/p7 and p7/NS2 cleavage sites. Identification of a Structural Constraint Located N-terminally of the Signal Peptide of NS2—As discussed above, when fused to a reporter protein, the hydrophobic stretches located N-terminally of E2/p7 and p7/NS2 cleavage sites (Fig. 2) have been shown to function as signal sequences (24Carrère-Kremer S. Montpellier-Pala C. Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3720-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28Cocquerel L. Op de Beeck A. Lambot M. Roussel J. Delgrange D. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2893-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether structural features in these sequences potentially lead to partial cleavages at the E2/p7 and p7/NS2 sites, we analyzed the efficiency of cleavage of a reporter protein fused to them. HCV glycoprotein E1 was used as a reporter protein because it is a glycosylated protein, and we can easily discriminate between glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms. E1 has indeed been shown to be a good reporter protein in some of our previous works (24Carrère-Kremer S. Montpellier-Pala C. Cocquerel L. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. J.

The function of most of these non-classical proteins appears to be molecular recognition in regulatory and assembly processes. Unfolded proteins can bind specifically and rapidly to their targets through large interfaces, thereby undergoing a significant disorder-order transition upon binding (2Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol.

The FnBRs of SfbI are homologous to tandem repeats in FnBPs of other streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, and new boundaries for FnBRs of both streptococci and staphylococci have recently been suggested based on structural data (7Schwarz-Linek U.

FnBRs are intrinsically disordered and undergo a conformational change on binding to Fn (12House-Pompeo K. Xu Y. Joh D. Speziale P. Höök M. J. Biol.

Although S. pyogenes was considered previously to be an exclusively extracellular pathogen, it has been shown more recently both to adhere to and invade human epithelial and endothelial cells (15LaPenta D.

Hanski E. Sela S. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) has been shown to efficiently mediate cellular internalization; in the uptake process Fn acts as a bridge between the pathogens and integrin receptors on the cell surface (20Ozeri V. Rosenshine I. Mosher D.F. Fässler R. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Internalization may contribute to the persistence of S. pyogenes in antibiotic-treated individuals (21Sela S. Barzilai A. Ann. Med. 1999; 31: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and aid hematogenous dissemination and/or evasion of the host immune system. Fn is present in a soluble form in human plasma and other body fluids and in an insoluble form in the extracellular matrix. Fn has a mosaic structure and is composed of independently folded Fn type 1, type 2 and type 3 (F1, F2, and F3) modules (22Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). FnBRs of S. aureus, S. pyogenes, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Fn (8Talay S.R. Valentin-Weigand P. Jerlström P.G. Timmis K.N. Chhatwal G.S. Infect.

Biochem. 1993; 214: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which is composed largely of a string of five F1 modules (1-5F1). High resolution structures of subdomains of the NTD have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (25Baron M. Norman D. Willis A. Campbell I.D. Nature. 1990; 345: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Williams M.J. Phan I. Harvey T.S. Rostagno A. Gold L.I. Campbell I.D. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8304-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The consensus fold of the F1 module consists of a double-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (strands A and B) folded over a triple-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (strands C, D, and E). The three-dimensional structure of an FnBP-derived peptide (B3 from S. dysgalactiae) in complex with 1F12F1 from the NTD of Fn was recently determined (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The structure revealed an anti-parallel orientation of the binding partners with the peptide forming additional β-strands at the edge of the triple-stranded β-sheets of the two F1 modules. This novel binding mechanism was named a “tandem β-zipper” (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Based on these structural data and sequence analyses, it was proposed that each FnBR forms an even longer tandem β-zipper when bound to intact NTD (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The main aim of this work is to address two key elements of the tandem β-zipper model of Fn/NTD interactions. First, we demonstrate that each of the five F1 modules of the NTD is specifically recognized by short, consecutive (i.e. tandemly arranged) amino acid sequences in FnBRs. Second, functional FnBRs are shown to be linear arrays of specific F1-binding motifs that need to be arranged in the correct order to bind to the NTD with high affinity. Data presented here also support the idea that bacterial peptides bind to all F1 modules of the NTD through a common mechanism, the β-zipper. This paper explains how a natively disordered functional domain of a bacterial protein forms a highly efficient ligand for a modular host protein. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Unlabeled and uniformly (U) 15N-labeled module pairs 1F12F1, 2F13F1, and 4F15F1 (residues 17-109, 62-151, and 152-244 of mature human Fn) were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified using procedures similar to those described previously (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R.

All expressions of 15N-labeled proteins were carried out in 500 ml of media containing 1% (w/v) (15NH4)2SO4. SfbI-4 and SfbI-5 were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins as described previously (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). SfbI-1 and SfbI-4.5 were produced in a similar fashion using the following oligonucleotides: SfbI-1, 5′-gcgggatcccctatattaccgaagtttatggaaat-3′ and 3′-gcgctcgagtcatggctctttcgtatcttctgtctc-5′, and SfbI-4.5, 5′-gcgctcgagtcatggctctttcgtatcttctgtctc-3′ and 3′-gcgctcgagtcatgtagtgtctttagtaaattc-5′. Recombinant SfbI peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C4 silica column (10 μm, 300 Å, 25 × 1 cm) with an elution gradient of 8-60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 18 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Synthetic Peptides—PyOT5, PyOn5, and PyFo5 were synthesized using standard N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl technology and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. All other peptides were purchased from Alta Bioscience (Birmingham, UK) and purified by reverse-phase HPLC, if required, on a C12 silica column (10 μm, 90 Å,25 × 1 cm) with an elution gradient of 10-20% acetonitrile in 5 mm ammonium carbonate buffer over 15 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The N and C termini of all peptides were capped by acetylation and amidation, respectively. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—The experiments were carried out with a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). In a standard experiment the cell contained 1.4 ml of a solution of an Fn fragment, and the syringe contained 295 μl of a solution of an appropriate bacterial peptide at a concentration that was 12-17 times higher than the protein concentration in the cell. The protein concentration in turn was chosen to comply with a c value (29Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar) between 20 and ∼1000, where c = [cell]/Kd, (where Kd is the dissociation constant). Titrations using module pairs were carried out at 25 °C in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) or, for PyTT5, 10 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Titrations of Fib1 were performed in phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.9 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) at 25 °C (except SfbI-5, which was at 37 °C). Fib1 (a 30-kDa proteolytic Fn fragment) was purchased from Sigma. Both the cell and syringe solutions were degassed at 15 °C for 20 min. The titrations were performed as follows. One preliminary injection was of 2 μl, and 30-44 injections were of 4-6 μl at an injection speed of 0.5 μl/min. The stirring speed was 310 rpm; the delay time between the injections was 3-5 min. To take into account heats of dilution, blank titrations were performed by injecting peptide solution into buffer, and the averaged heat of dilution was subtracted from the main experiment. Data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin software, fitting them to a single binding site model. Peptide concentrations, which were defined by weighing freeze-dried peptide, were corrected to result in binding stoichiometries of 1:1. This concentration adjustment never exceeded ±10%. As described previously (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), the association constants for the intact FnBR interactions were expected to be too high to be directly measurable by ITC at the low ionic strength conditions used to study F1 module pair binding. It was observed that the binding of FnBR-derived peptides to F1 module pairs is significantly weakened with increasing ionic strength. 2U. Schwarz-Linek, unpublished data. Thus, experiments with full-length FnBRs were carried out at physiological ionic strength in order to obtain sigmoidal titration curves that could be deconvoluted (29Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). In addition, binding of SfbI-5 could only be analyzed at a higher temperature (37 °C rather than 25 °C), where the affinity was further attenuated, and the signal-to-noise ratio was increased (because the binding is exothermic). NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed on spectrometers belonging to the Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences with 1H operating frequencies of 500, 600, and 750 MHz. The spectrometers are all equipped with Oxford Instruments superconducting magnets, OMEGA software and digital control equipment (Bruker Instruments), home-built triple-resonance pulsed-field-gradient probe-heads (30Soffe N. Boyd J. Leonard M. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 116: 117-121Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and home-built linear amplifiers for 1H,15N, and 13C nuclei. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C. For the assignment of 2F13F1, a sample containing 0.7 mm U-15N-labeled 2F13F1 in 95% H2O, 5% D2O at pH 5.0 was used. A standard set of two- and three-dimensional spectra was recorded similar to the previously described procedure for U-15N-labeled 1F12F1 (27Potts J.R. Bright J.R. Bolton D. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8304-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For the assignment of 2F13F1 bound to PyTT5, a sample containing 0.5 mm U-15N-labeled 2F13F1 and 1.0 mm PyTT5 in 95% H2O, 5% D2O at pH 5.0 was used. 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (1H,15N HSQC) spectral assignments for U-15N-labeled 1F12F1 and U-15N-labeled 4F15F1 at appropriate pH values were obtained using previously determined assignments (14Penkett C.J. Dobson C.M. Smith L.J. Bright J.R. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2887-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Potts J.R. Bright J.R. Bolton D. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8304-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All NMR samples were unbuffered. NMR Binding Studies—Small amounts of freeze-dried peptide were added to a sample containing the appropriate 15N-labeled module pair (0.2 mm in 95% H2O, 5% D2O at pH 5.0). In a typical titration experiment the concentrations of the peptide were chosen to be 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.4, and 1.8 mm. The maximum value of the peptide concentration was defined either by reaching saturation or by limited solubility of the particular module pair/peptide mixture. The final peptide:protein ratios in chemical shift perturbation experiments were: for 1F12F1, 2 (PyOT5), 9.5 (PyOn5), 18 (PyTw4), 9 (PyTw5), 8.5 (PyFo5); for 2F13F1, 7 (PyTT4), 2 (PyTT5), 9 (PyFF5), 5 (SfbII-FF3), 7 (PyTw5), 15 (PyTh4 and PyTh5), 18 (PyFo5); for 4F15F1, 14 (PyFF1), 9 (PyFF5), 6 (SfbII-FF3), 8 (PyTw5), 18 (PyFo5), 3 (PyFi5). For every titration step, the pH of the sample was re-adjusted to 5.0, and a two-dimensional gradient-enhanced 1H,15N HSQC (31Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2438) Google Scholar) spectrum with water flip-back solvent suppression (32Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) was recorded. Only resonances that were non-overlapped throughout the titration were used for fitting. Binding constants were determined as previously described (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Peptide concentrations were corrected, taking into account the loss of sample volume in the course of the experiments (typically 5 μl per titration step, as judged by weight). NMR Competition Experiment—Two identical samples of 600 μl of 0.2 mm U-15N-labeled 2F13F1 where prepared, and virtually identical 1H,15N HSQC spectra were recorded. Freeze-dried aliquots of 0.12 μmol of SfbII-FF3 were added to both samples, again resulting in virtually identical 1H,15N HSQC spectra. One sample was complemented with 0.12 μmol of freeze-dried unlabeled 2F13F1; to the other sample 0.12 μmol of freeze-dried unlabeled 4F15F1 were added, and 1H,15N HSQC spectra were recorded. Dissection Approach—The interactions of three Fn type 1 module pairs (1F12F1, 2F13F1, 4F15F1) with peptides from FnBRs of SfbI were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and ITC (Fig. 1, Table I). Peptides from S. pyogenes FnBRs were chosen according to the tandem β-zipper model (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) to bind to either a specific F1 module or module pair of NTD. Series of 1H,15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled F1 module pairs at increasing concentrations of peptide were acquired (HSQC titrations). Fn residues affected by peptide binding were identified on the basis of observed chemical shift changes of F1 module backbone amide resonances (chemical shift perturbation mapping (33Zuiderweg E.R.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2A and B). Kd values were derived directly from the chemical shift changes if the kinetics of binding were fast on the NMR time scale (34Wemmer D.E. Williams P.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 739-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2G). Other Kd values were determined using ITC (Fig. 2F). For some complexes, where it was impossible to track the resonances in the HSQC titrations, spectra of fully bound 15N-labeled module pairs were assigned using three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy.Table IDissociation constants (Kd values) for the interaction of a range of synthetic peptides derived from streptococcal FnBPs with three F1 module pairs from the NTD of human FnPeptide residuesNameaThe nomenclature used for the peptides is explained in the legend of Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab 1F1 and 2F1 Are Specifically Recognized by Short Consecutive Motifs of SfbI—The direct involvement of 1F1 and 2F1 in interactions with a bacterial peptide from S. dysgalactiae FnBB was demonstrated recently by the determination of the three-dimensional structure of 1F12F1 in complex with the B3 peptide (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Here, the involvement of both modules in binding to the homologous peptide from SfbI is confirmed, and the specificity of F1-module recognition is demonstrated. The peptide PyOT5 bound to 1F12F1 with a Kd of 0.45 μm (Fig. 2F) (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G. Gough T.S. Höök M. Campbell I.D.

Biochem. 1998; 258: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Schwarz-Linek U. Plevin M.J. Pickford A.R. Höök M. Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In an NMR binding experiment significant chemical shift changes were induced in residues in both 1F1 and 2F1, indicating the direct involvement of both modules in binding to PyOT5 (Fig. 2C). The tandem β-zipper model for NTD recognition is based on the existence of independent, consecutive motifs within FnBRs that interact with specific F1 modules. Therefore, PyOT5 was dissected into predicted single-module binding segments. PyOn5 and PyTw5, representing the C- and N-terminal halves of PyOT5, caused chemical shift changes exclusively in 1F1 (Fig. 2, A and D) or 2F1 (Fig. 2, B and E), respectively. The observed chemical shift differences resembled the perturbation patterns for each module on binding of PyOT5. The Kd values for binding to 1F12F1 were 159 and 63 μm for PyOn5 and PyTw5 (Fig. 2G), respectively. We conclude that 1F1 and 2F1 are recognized specifically by separate motifs of SfbI, resulting in an anti-parallel attachment of the peptide to the module pair 1F12F1. 3F1 Is Involved in Binding of SfbI to the NTD—The direct involvement of 3F1 in FnBR binding has to date not been demonstrated. The Kd for the interaction of the predicted 2F13F1-binding peptide PyTT5 with 2F13F1 was 3.6 μm (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S. Briggs J.A.G.

In NMR binding studies PyTT5 induced chemical shift changes in both 2F1 and 3F1 residues (Fig. 3A). To elucidate the role of 3F1, PyTT5 was dissected into single-module binding halves (PyTw5 and PyTh5). The 2F1-binding peptide, PyTw5, bound to the module pair with significantly lower affinity (Kd = 66 μm) than the two-module binding peptide. The pattern of chemical shift perturbations in 2F1 is very similar to that observed on binding of PyOT5 and PyTw5 to 1F12F1 (Fig. 2, C and E) and indicates specific recognition of 2F1 (Fig. 3B). Only one residue in 3F1, Gly-142, was significantly affected (using a 0.1 ppm cutoff) by PyTw5. Based on the previously determined structure of the highly homologous (48% identity) 4F15F1 module pair (26Williams M.J. Phan I. Harvey T.S. Rostagno A. Gold L.I. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), this residue is in a loop in 3F1 that is expected to be in close proximity to 2F1 residues. Thus, it is likely that binding of PyTw5 to 2F1 causes limited chemical shift perturbations in 3F1 due to indirect (intermodular) interactions. Direct evidence for an intermodule interface awaits the determination of the structure of 2F13F1. The putative 3F1-binding peptide, PyTh5, when added to 2F13F1 in excess, caused chemical shift changes that were confined to residues in 3F1 (Fig. 3C). It should be noted that although the chemical shift changes are very small, their significance is clear from their comparison with the even smaller changes observed for 2F1 residues. Moreover, the perturbation pattern induced by PyTh5 resembles the pattern for 3F1 residues upon binding of the two-module binding peptide, PyTT5. Thus, it could be shown that 3F1 is directly involved in interactions with FnBRs and is specifically recognized by the short peptide, PyTh5. The successful dissection of PyTT5 also further demonstrates the specificity of the 2F1-binding motif in SfbI in that it binds neither 1F1 nor 3F1. The PyTh5/2F13F1 interaction was too weak for a Kd to be measured. The 3F1-binding segment, however, contributes significantly to the affinity of the two-module binding peptide, PyTT5. This result is an example where NMR provides unique, residue-specific information for a very weak but physiologically relevant interaction. Similar results were obtained for 2F13F1 binding of peptides from SfbI-4 (data not shown). SfbI Contains 4F1- and 5F1-binding Motifs—Binding of the FnBR region of SfbI to 4F15F1 has been reported (11Schwarz-Linek U. Werner J.M. Pickford A.R. Gurusiddappa S. Kim J.H. Pilka E.S.

https://openalex.org/W1989295134,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are neuronal Na+ channels that belong to the epithelial Na+ channel/degenerin family. ASICs are transiently activated by a rapid drop in extracellular pH. Conditions of low extracellular pH, such as ischemia and inflammation in which ASICs are thought to be active, are accompanied by increased protease activity. We show here that serine proteases modulate the function of ASIC1a and ASIC1b but not of ASIC2a and ASIC3. We show that protease exposure shifts the pH dependence of ASIC1a activation and steady-state inactivation to more acidic pH. As a consequence, protease exposure leads to a decrease in current response if ASIC1a is activated by a pH drop from pH 7.4. If, however, acidification occurs from a basal pH of ∼7, protease-exposed ASIC1a shows higher activity than untreated ASIC1a. We provide evidence that this bi-directional regulation of ASIC1a function also occurs in neurons. Thus, we have identified a mechanism that modulates ASIC function and may allow ASIC1a to adapt its gating to situations of persistent extracellular acidification."

Deletion of the N-glycosylation sites at N1, N3, N5, and N7 but not at N2, N4, and N6 significantly slowed endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking, impaired apical sorting, and enhanced endocytosis from the apical membrane, resulting in decreased apical expression. Golgi mannosidase inhibition to prevent carbohydrate chain branching and elongation resulted in faster internalization and degradation of the β subunit, indicating that terminal glycosylation is important for stabilization of the protein in the apical membrane and protection of internalized protein from targeting to the degradation pathway. The decrease in the apical content of the β subunit was less with mannosidase inhibition compared with that found in the N1, N3, N5, and N7 site mutants, suggesting that the core region sugars are more important than the terminal sugars for apical sorting.

Sorting of proteins between apical and basolateral membranes in polarized cells depends on the recognition of intrinsic sorting signals within the proteins by specific sorting machinery in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; dMAN, deoxymannojirimycin; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; Endo H, endoglycosidase H. or endosomes (1Traub L.M.

Basolateral sorting signals often contain tyrosine-based, dileucine, or other hydrophobic motifs that are recognized by clathrin coat proteins that package them into basolateral transport vesicles (5Matter K.

Apical sorting signals are less well defined. N-Linked glycans are considered as possible candidates based on the findings that some proteins gain the ability to reach the apical membrane after recombinant addition of N-glycosylation sites (7Gut A. Kappeler F. Hyka N. Balda M.S. Hauri H.P. Matter K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1919-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and that other proteins entirely or partially lose apical expression as a result of removal of N-glycans by mutation or treatment with glycosylation inhibitors (5Matter K.

N-Glycosylation might significantly affect other trafficking steps, including protein folding and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), endocytosis, recycling, and degradation. Because the effect of N-glycan removal on an apical sorting event has not been differentiated from a possible impairment of other trafficking steps, the role of N-glycans as apical sorting signals remains unclear. An interesting paradigm for the study of the role of glycosylation in protein maturation, trafficking, sorting, and degradation is an apically targeted multiply glycosylated protein, the H,K-ATPase β subunit. The gastric H,K-ATPase, the enzyme responsible for acid secretion in the stomach, consists of two subunits, a catalytic α subunit and an accessory β subunit, which has seven N-glycosylation sites. Glycosylation of the β subunit has been shown to be critical for the quality control of the H,K-ATPases in the ER (11Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 12Asano S. Kawada K. Kimura T. Grishin A.V. Caplan M.J. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8324-8330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Specific N-glycosylation sites have been found to be essential for plasma membrane delivery of the H,K-ATPase β subunit in non-polarized HEK-293 (13Vagin O. Denevich S. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C968-C976Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and for delivery of both α and β subunits in COS-7 cells (12Asano S. Kawada K. Kimura T. Grishin A.V. Caplan M.J. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8324-8330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may also play a role in apical sorting. The homologous Na,K-ATPase also consists of α and β subunits. Of four known isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase β subunits, β2 is the most homologous to the H,K-ATPase β subunit, has up to nine glycosylation sites (14Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar), and appears to result in apical sorting of the Na,K-ATPase α·β complex in a number of tissues (15Wilson P.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 16Wilson P.D. Devuyst O. Li X. Gatti L. Falkenstein D. Robinson S. Fambrough D. Burrow C.R. Am. J.

Martin-Vasallo P. Mobasheri R. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 141-154PubMed Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase that contains either the β1 or β3 isoform with only two or three N-glycosylation sites localizes exclusively in the basolateral membrane (18Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1304-G1313PubMed Google Scholar). The high degree of glycosylation in the H,K-ATPase β and Na,K-ATPase β2 subunits might imply a role of N-glycosylation in the apical sorting of the corresponding α·β complexes. N-Glycosylation occurs in various stages. N-Linked oligosaccharides appear when the 14-saccharide core is transferred from the dolichol phosphate precursor to the nascent membrane protein that remains associated with the translocon in the ER. Immediately after coupling the core to the asparagine of the specific amino acid NXS or NXT motif, the N-glycosylation site, the terminal glucose residues are trimmed by ER glucosidases. Various chaperones such as calnexin bind to sugar chains as quality control elements at this and perhaps later stages. Subsequently, the mannose residues are trimmed in the ER and then in the Golgi by mannosidases I and II, respectively. This is followed by elongation of the carbohydrate chains due to addition of terminal sugars by the action of various glycosyltransferases in the trans-Golgi (19Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). There is considerable variation in the number and composition of terminal chains in the mature complex oligosaccharides, giving rise to heterogeneity of glycosylated proteins. The core region that contains five residues originating from the initial 14-saccharide core is the same in all molecular species of mature glycoproteins. Deletion of any N-glycosylation site in a protein abrogates the whole oligosaccharide tree at that particular locus, leaving the others intact. Inhibition of glucose or mannose trimming prevents addition of the terminal sugar chains but leaves core regions intact at all N-glycosylation sites. This enables distinctions to be made concerning the roles of core region and terminal sugars at various stages of processing and trafficking of the protein. Here, we quantitatively determined at which trafficking stages N-glycosylation deficiency affects apical polarity. We determined the effect of either deletion of individual N-glycosylation sites or treatment of the cells with N-glycan-trimming inhibitors on the steady-state distribution of the H,K-ATPase β subunit between the ER, Golgi, and apical and basolateral membranes as well as on endocytosis efficiency and degradation rate in polarized LLC-PK1 cells by quantifying the immature and mature forms of the protein that differ in their molecular masses and by using surface-specific biotinylation and confocal microscopy. Glycosylation at the N1, N3, N5, and N7 sites of the gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit is crucial for ER-to-Golgi trafficking, apical membrane delivery, and stability of the protein in the apical membrane. Considering the steady-state apical content of the mature H,K-ATPase β subunit as a result of dynamic equilibrium between two opposite processes, the apical membrane delivery from TGN/endosomes, and endocytosis from the apical membrane, we were able to quantify the contribution of N-glycosylation to each of these steps. In addition, we show that particular carbohydrate residues of the N-glycans have different roles in apical membrane delivery and endocytosis, which is the first indication for a specific role of certain carbohydrates in apical sorting. In the mature complex-type glycoprotein, the core region sugars are more important for the apical sorting event in TGN/endosomes compared with terminal sugars, whereas the terminal sugars anchor the protein on the apical membrane and also protect the protein from targeting to the degradation pathway after endocytosis. Construction of cDNAs Encoding Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP)H,K-ATPase β Subunit Fusion Proteins and Mutants Lacking Glycosylation Sites—pcDNA3(+)β (20Lambrecht N. Munson K. Vagin O. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4041-4048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was used as a source for cDNA encoding the rabbit H,K-ATPase β subunit (GenBank™/EBI accession number M35544) (21Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Sachs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6767-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the β subunit was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the expression vector pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) using BglII and BamHI restriction sites to form pEYFP-β, which encodes YFP-β, a fusion protein of YFP linked to the N terminus of the H,K-ATPase β subunit. Mutants were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit has seven N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular C terminus. Seven single mutants of YFP-β fusion protein lacking a single N-glycosylation site, N99Q (N1), N103Q (N2), N130Q (N3), N146Q (N4), N161Q (N5), N193Q (N6), and N222Q (N7), were constructed using pEYFP-β as a template. Stable Transfection—To obtain cell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant YFP-β fusion proteins, LLC-PK1 cells were grown on 10-cm plates until 20% confluent and transfected with wild-type YFP-β or mutant YFP-β using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 24 h after transfection, stable cell lines were selected by addition of the eukaryotic selection marker G418 at a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. This concentration of G418 was maintained until single colonies appeared. 15-20 colonies were isolated, expanded, and grown in the presence of 0.25 mg of G418/ml of medium in 24-well plates. Two clones with the highest expression of YFP-β were selected and expanded for further studies. Confocal Microscopy Studies—Cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant YFP-β were grown for at least 5 days after becoming confluent on glass bottom micro-well dishes (Mattek Corp.). Confocal microscopy images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope with LSM 510 Version 3.2 software. Estimation of Surface YFP-β Content by Surface-specific Biotinylation—LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant YFP-β were maintained for at least 5 days after becoming confluent in Corning Costar polyester Transwell inserts (Corning Inc.) in 6-well plates. Biotinylation of the apical or basolateral membrane proteins was performed by previously described procedures (22Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kroepfl J.F. Gardinier M.V. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1301-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell mono-layers were biotinylated with EZ-Link™ sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl 1,3′-dithiopropionate (Pierce), which was added from either the apical or basolateral side. After quenching the biotinylation reaction, cells were washed and then lysed by incubation with 200 μl of 0.15 m NaCl in 15 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 4 mm EGTA. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Samples containing 20 μl of supernatant mixed with 15 μl of SDS-containing sample buffer were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel to determine the total YFP-β content in the supernatant. To precipitate biotinylated proteins, the rest of each supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) in a total volume of 800 μl of the lysis buffer for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous rotation. Precipitated complexes were washed three times on the beads, and then proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol in 0.1 m Tris (pH 6.8)) for 5 min at 80 °C, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody 2B6 against the H,K-ATPase β subunit (MBL, Inc.) or the monoclonal antibody against the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit (Novus Biologicals) as the primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega) as the secondary antibody according to the manufacturers' instructions. Endocytosis Assay by Apical Surface Biotinylation—Polarized cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant YFP-β were biotinylated from the apical side as described above. Cells were incubated at 18 °C to prevent apical membrane delivery for 20, 60, or 120 min. After that, apical biotin was stripped off by incubation with 50 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in 100 mm NaCl with 10% fetal bovine serum (pH 8.4) twice for 20 min. After cell lysis, the internalized biotinylated proteins were precipitated, washed, eluted from streptavidin-agarose beads, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described above. In the negative control, biotin was stripped off immediately after biotinylation. The initial apical content was determined by lysing cells immediately after biotinylation. In the positive control, cells were incubated at 18 °C for 60 or 120 min to account for any instability of biotinylated protein and then lysed. After cell lysis, biotinylated proteins were precipitated, washed, eluted, and analyzed as described above. For the mutants with very low apical content of YFP-β (N1, N3, and N5), each experimental condition was repeated in three wells, and cell lysates from three identical wells were combined before precipitation on streptavidin-agarose beads. Endocytosis efficiency was calculated as a percentage of apical YFP-β that was internalized for 1 h. Treatment of Cells with Glycosidase Inhibitors—Cells were incubated with castanospermine (Sigma), the Golgi mannosidase I inhibitor deoxymannojirimycin (dMAN) (Sigma), or the Golgi mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine (Sigma) at a concentration of 1, 2, or 200 μg/ml, respectively, for 48 h prior to apical biotinylation. Glycosidase Cleavage—Where indicated, the total cell lysates or proteins precipitated by streptavidin-agarose beads were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (New England Biolabs Inc.) or endoglycosidase H (Endo H) from Streptomyces plicatus (Glyco-Prozyme Inc.) according to the manufacturers' instructions. In experiments with live cells, sialidase from Salmonella typhimurium recombinant in Escherichia coli (Glyco-Prozyme Inc.), β1,4-galactosidase from Streptococcus pneumonia (Glyco-Prozyme Inc.), or PNGase F from F. meningosepticum was added to the cell medium from the apical side at a concentration of 1 unit/ml, 66 milliunits/ml, or 7500 New England Biolabs units/ml, respectively, and incubated for 16 h. 1 h prior to completion of the cleavage, cycloheximide (Sigma) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml was added to the medium to inhibit de novo synthesis of YFP-β. Analysis of N-Glycosylation Alteration—The H,K-ATPase β subunit has seven N-glycosylation sites. The mature oligosaccharide linked to each of the seven sites consists of the three-mannosyl core region and terminal chains (Fig. 1). Three approaches were used to analyze the effect of N-glycosylation deficiency in the β subunit. By mutating each of seven N-glycosylation sites and expressing these mutants in polarized cells, we obtained β subunits lacking all core and terminal sugars at only a single N-glycosylation site, with six sites still normally glycosylated. Alternatively, cells expressing the wild-type β subunit were treated with a glucosidase inhibitor (castanospermine), a Golgi mannosidase I inhibitor (dMAN), or a Golgi mannosidase II inhibitor (swainsonine). The inhibitors prevent glucose or mannose trimming and further elongation of all the carbohydrate chains and thus result in expression of the 14-saccharide core and the high mannose- and hybrid-type oligosaccharides, respectively. These steps are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1A. Thus, the glycoprotein formed in the presence of castanospermine or dMAN lacks all the terminal sugars normally present in the complex-type β subunit; and in the presence of swainsonine, the glycoprotein lacks the majority of normal terminal sugars at all seven N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1A). The complex-, hybrid-, and high mannose-type and 14-saccharide core forms of YFP-β can be clearly distinguished from each other upon SDS-PAGE due to the difference in molecular masses, as shown in Fig. 1B. Characterization of Glycosylated Forms of YFP-β Expressed in LLC-PK1 Cells—YFP-β was detected in cell lysates of LLCPK1 cells as two bands, one at 80-100 kDa and the other at ∼75 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 1). After PNGase F treatment of the cell lysates, the bands at 80-100 and 75 kDa both disappeared, and a single band was seen at ∼55 kDa, corresponding to deglycosylated YFP-β (lane 3). A similar product was detected after treatment of the cell lysates with Endo H, but this treatment resulted in the disappearance of only the lower band on the Western blot, whereas the higher band was retained (lane 2). It is known that Endo H cleaves only high mannose- or hybrid-type glycoproteins, whereas complex-type chains are Endo H-resistant. Therefore, the 80-100-kDa band represents the complex-type glycosylated fraction of YFP-β. The 75-kDa Endo H-sensitive band represents high mannose-type YFP-β (Fig. 1B, fourth lane), as can be concluded from comparison with the lysates prepared from cells preincubated with the glycosylation inhibitors dMAN, which led to formation of only high mannose-type YFP-β (second lane), and swainsonine, which resulted in formation of both hybrid- and high mannose-type glycoproteins (third lane). In contrast to the total cell lysate, the apically biotinylated protein fraction contained only the complex-type glycosylated fraction of YFP-β (Fig. 2, lane 4), which was Endo H-resistant (lane 5). Thus, the mature YFP-β component in LLC-PK1 cells is complex-type glycosylated protein. Only this fraction of the YFP-β pool was able to reach the apical membrane. The high mannose-type core glycosylated fraction of YFP-β present in cell lysates therefore represents the immature ER portion of the YFP-β pool. Surface biotinylation was used to quantify the apical and basolateral content of YFP-β (Fig. 3). Under biotinylation conditions, (i) LLC-PK1 cells may have their tight junctions disrupted during the biotinylation procedure, and (ii) their apical membranes may also become leaky. Hence, in all experiments, biotinylation of basolateral membranes was used to define a specific basolateral location of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit (18Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1304-G1313PubMed Google Scholar) as a control for intact tight junctions, and the absence of high mannose-type YFP-β in biotinylated samples was used as an indication of apical membrane integrity. The presence of biotinylated high mannose-type YFP-β protein would show that the biotinylation reagent had access to the intracellular pool of high mannose-type YFP-β because of the apical membrane leakiness during the experiment. As shown in Fig. 3 (left panel), ∼85% of surface YFP-β was detected on the apical membrane. In contrast, the endogenous Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit was predominantly labeled from the basolateral membrane, indicating integrity of tight junctions. Effect of N-Glycosylation Site Mutations on the Relative Apical Content of YFP-β in LLC-PK1 Cells—Using confocal microscopy, the wild-type YFP-β was detected predominantly in the apical region in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 4, left panel), as can be seen in the confocal apical XY section of the cell monolayer and particularly in the Z section. A minor fraction of YFP-β was detected inside the cells (XY section through the middle of the cell layer) and in the lateral membranes (Z section). In contrast, the YFP-β mutant lacking the N1 glycosylation site was accumulated mostly intracellularly (right panel). The protein was predominantly localized to the perinuclear region, presumably in the ER and Golgi. To quantify the apical content in the mutants compared with the wild-type protein, cells expressing wild-type or mutant YFP-β were biotinylated from the apical side in the same experiment to prevent variations in biotinylation, streptavidinagarose precipitation, and immunoblotting efficiencies. The apical content was normalized to the total YFP-β content in the corresponding cell lysate for each mutant and compared with that in the wild-type protein, as shown in Fig. 5. The relative apical content was dramatically decreased in N1, N3, and N5 by 14.5-, 7.1-, and 5.5-fold, respectively, and was not detectable in N7. In contrast, mutation of N2, N4, and N6 only moderately decreased the relative apical content (from 1.4- to 1.7-fold). We found that mature YFP-β contains complex-type oligosaccharides only and that the high mannose-type form of the protein corresponds to the ER fraction of the cellular YFP-β pool (Fig. 2). Therefore, the ratio between the complex-type form and total YFP-β can be used as a measure of ER-to-Golgi trafficking. In all the mutants except N6, the relative content of the complex-type glycosylated fraction of YFP-β was decreased, indicating that these mutations slowed down ER-to-Golgi trafficking and caused more ER retention. The most significant effect on ER-to-Golgi trafficking was observed in the N1 and N7 mutants (2.3- and 6.4-fold decreases, respectively). Effect of N-Glycosylation Site Mutations on the Internalization Efficiency of YFP-β in LLC-PK1 Cells—To compare the effect of mutations on the internalization efficiency of YFP-β, the apical surface of cells expressing wild-type or mutant YFP-β was biotinylated, and cells were incubated at 18 °C to prevent apical membrane delivery of internalized proteins. Any apical biotin was then cleaved off, and internalized biotinylated proteins were detected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Internalization efficiency (viz. the fraction of apical YFP-β internalized after 1 h) was increased from 2- to 3-fold in the N1, N3, and N5 mutants, but was only slightly increased in the N1, N4, and N6 mutants (Fig. 6). The internalization efficiency in N7 could not be measured due to the very low apical content of YFP-β in this mutant. Effect of N-Glycosylation Site Mutations on Apical Sorting—The surface distribution of mutants lacking the N3 or N5 site was different from that of the wild-type protein. The major plasma membrane-located fraction of the mutant proteins was detected on the basolateral (but not apical) membrane (Fig. 3). This might imply that removal of the particular N-glycosylation site impaired apical sorting. However, a steady-state distribution between two distinct surface domains is not a result only of apical sorting in the TGN and/or endosomes, but also reflects a balance between apical and basolateral sorting as well as apical and basolateral endocytosis. To quantify the effect of mutations solely on apical sorting, we compared their effect on the relative apical content and the efficiency of endocytosis and calculated the effect of mutations on the apical sorting efficiency. The apical content of YFP-β normalized by comparison with the mature complex-type fraction of YFP-β (CA/CT) (Fig. 5) reflects a steady-state distribution between the apical and internal mature complex-type pools of YFP-β. We found that the rate of degradation of the mature complex-type fraction was not changed by N-glycosylation site mutations. Therefore, the distribution between apical and internal YFP-β could be shifted toward the internal pool in the mutants either because of enhanced endocytosis or because of the impaired apical membrane delivery (see Fig. 10). The relative decrease in the apical content was calculated for each mutant by dividing the apical content in the wild-type protein, (CA/CT)wt, by the apical content in the mutant, (CA/CT)mut (Table I, second column). Similarly, the relative increase in the efficiency of endocytosis in each mutant was calculated by dividing the endocytosis efficiency in the mutant by the endocytosis efficiency in the wild-type protein as assessed by apical biotinylation as described above (Table I, third column). If the apical content was decreased by the same factor as the endocytosis efficiency was increased, then the enhanced endocytosis would be the only reason for the lowered apical content in this mutant. However, in all mutants, the apical content was decreased to a greater extent than the endocytosis efficiency. For example, in the N5 mutant, the apical content was decreased by 4.5-fold, but the internalization efficiency was increased by only 2-fold. This indicates that the apical membrane delivery was also affected by the mutation because the relative apical content reflects a balance between apical membrane delivery and endocytosis. If the apical content in the mutant is decreased by X-fold compared with the wild-type protein and the endocytosis efficiency is increased by Y-fold, then the apical membrane delivery rate must be decreased by Z = X/Y-fold. Thus, as shown in Table I, the effect of each mutation on the apical sorting efficiency was calculated as a ratio between the factor in the second column, (CA/CT)wt/(CA/CT)mut, and the factor in the third column, (endocytosis efficiency)mut/(endocytosis efficiency)wt.Table IEffect of N-glycosylation site mutations on the relative apical content, endocytosis, and apical sorting of mutant YFP-β compared with wild-type YFP-βYFP-βDecrease in apical content normalized by total complex-type (CA/CT)aCA, YFP-β on the apical membrane; CT, complex-type glycosylated YFP-β in the cell lysate; ND, not detectable.Increase in endocytosis efficiencyDecrease in apical sorting efficiency (calculated)bDecrease in apical sorting efficiency = (decrease in CA/CT)/(increase in endocytosis efficiency).-fold-fold-foldN16.23.12.0N21.21.21.0N35.22.62.0N41.41.11.3N54.52.02.3N61.61.11.4N7NDNDNDWild-type1.01.01.0a CA, YFP-β on the apical membrane; CT, complex-type glycosylated YFP-β in the cell lysate; ND, not detectable.b Decrease in apical sorting efficiency = (decrease in CA/CT)/(increase in endocytosis efficiency).

Mass spectrometric analysis of CPT-IL tryptic digests revealed the presence of three phosphopeptides including one with a protein kinase CKII (CKII) consensus site. Incubation of dephosphorylated outer membranes with protein kinases and [γ-32P]ATP resulted in radiolabeling of CPT-I only by CKII.

The sequence of the peptide and position of phosphorylated amino acids have been determined unequivocally as FpSSPETDpSHRFGK (residues 740-752). Furthermore, incubation of dephosphorylated outer membranes with CKII and unlabeled ATP led to increased catalytic activity and rendered malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPT-I from competitive to uncompetitive.

These observations identify a new mechanism for regulation of hepatic CPT-I by phosphorylation. β-Oxidation of long-chain fatty acids represents a main energy-yielding process for many organs, especially for muscle and liver. The liver plays a central role in both physiological and pathological conditions by switching from a carbohydrate to fatty acid-based metabolism. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I), 1The abbreviations used are: CPT-I, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I; CaMII, Ca2+/calmodulin kinase; CKII, protein kinase CKII; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, ESI tandem mass spectrometry; PPI, protein phosphatase inhibitor. localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the formation of long-chain acylcarnitines from their respective CoA esters, committing them to β-oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix. By virtue of its inhibition by malonyl-CoA, CPT-I represents the key regulatory site controlling the flux through β-oxidation. Consistent with its central role in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, the enzyme exists in at least two isoforms, the liver (CPT-IL) and muscle types (CPT-IM) (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Recently a third form, the brain-specific isoform (CPT-Ic), has been cloned and expressed (2Price N.T. van der Leij F.R. Jackson V.N. Corstorphine C.G. Thomson R. Sorenson A. Zammit V.A. Genomics. 2002; 80: 432-442Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although the protein sequences of mouse and human CPT-Ic show high similarity to those of CPT-IL and CPT-IM, only malonyl-CoA binding but no catalytic activity is observed with the protein expressed in yeast. The liver and muscle isoforms differ in their regulatory properties. The muscle isoform is thought to be regulated solely by changes in malonyl-CoA concentration. However, Sugden et al. (3Sugden M.C. Priesturan D.A. Orfali K.A. Holness M.J. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have shown that hyperthyroidism facilitates myocardial fatty acid oxidation by a mechanism that involves increased activity and decreased malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT-I and that the two parameters can apparently be regulated independently from each other. The liver isoform, in addition to being regulated via changes in malonyl-CoA concentrations, also is regulated by changes in the sensitivity of the enzymes to malonyl-CoA inhibition (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 4Zammit V.A. Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Adv.

Thus, CPT-IL is unique in responding to different physiological states, e.g. starvation, insulin deficiency, and hypo- and hyperthyroidism by changing its sensitivity to inhibitor severalfold (6Robinson N. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1982; 266: 177-179Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Bremer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 8Saggerson E.D.

Acta. 1983; 750: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These changes amplify the effects of fluctuations in the cytosolic concentration of malonyl-CoA occurring under these conditions. Although changes in malonyl-CoA sensitivity are considered the major means for the regulation of the liver isoform of CPT-I and thus for hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, the mechanism for the decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity has not been uncovered. It has been suggested that changes in the lipid composition of the membrane microenvironment in which CPT-I resides are important for alteration in malonyl-CoA sensitivity (10Zammit V.A. Corstorphine C. Kolodziej M. Fraser F. Lipids. 1998; 33: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Mynatt R.L. Greenhaw J.J. Cook G.A. Biochem.

J. 1985; 232: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Alternatively, covalent modification of CPT-I protein itself could also be responsible for these changes in the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the enzymes. Recent molecular biology approaches suggest that modulation of interdomain interactions may be involved in the changes in malonyl-CoA sensitivity displayed by the liver isoform under different physiological conditions (13Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol.

These changes in the interactions may arise from covalent modification (phosphorylation) of the protein. Phosphorylation of one or more amino acid residues in CPT-I would affect the charge distribution and consequently alter the intramolecular interactions between the cytosolic N- and C-terminal domains resulting in altered malonyl-CoA sensitivity and catalytic activity. Thus, Pegorier et al. (20Pegorier J.-P. Garcia-Garcia M. Prip-Buus C. Duee P.-H. Kohl C. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that glucagon or dibutyryl-cAMP treatment of fetal rabbit hepatocytes decreases the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT-I in isolated mitochondria 5- and 10-fold, respectively, with no effect on the catalytic activity. These data suggest that the changes observed in malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT-I are brought about by a cAMP-dependent signaling event. In addition to malonyl-CoA sensitivity, phosphorylation-based regulation of CPT-IL catalytic activity has also been suggested. In isolated rat hepatocytes glucagon or dibutyryl-cAMP increased CPT-I activity without affecting malonyl-CoA sensitivity, an effect that was mimicked by the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid (21Guzman M. Geelen M.J.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies from the same authors indicated that phosphorylation of cytoskeletal components rather than phosphorylation of CPT-IL is responsible for the increased catalytic activity (22Guzman M. Kolodziej M.P. Caldwell A. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Velasco G. Geelen M.J.H. Gomez del Pulgar T. Guzman M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 466: 43-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism(s) by which malonyl-CoA sensitivity and/or catalytic activity are altered are not known. Based on these observations and on our preliminary findings with protein phosphatase inhibitors on malonyl-CoA sensitivity of hepatic CPT-I (24Hoppel C. Kerner J. Distler A. Minkler P. FASEB J. 2004; 18: A862Google Scholar, 25Hoppel C. Kerner J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A158Google Scholar), we initiated studies using a proteomic approach to elucidate the potential role of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on the regulation of rat liver mitochondrial CPT-I activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Animals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-400 g) were obtained from Zivic-Miller (Allison Park, PA) and had free access to food and water. New Zealand White male rabbits for production of polyclonal antisera were purchased from Covance Research (Denver, PA). All procedures were approved by the Veterans Administration Institutional Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of animals in research. Chemicals—Polyclonal antisera against oligopeptides specific for CPT-IL were prepared as described earlier (26Hoppel C. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Minkler P. Tandler B. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the specific antibodies were isolated by affinity chromatography using peptides coupled to Sulfo-Link resin (Pierce). Recombinant catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, catalytic subunit of protein kinase C, the recombinant α-subunits of rat Ca2+/calmodulin kinase (CaMII), and human casein kinase II (or protein kinase CKII (CKII)) were purchased from Calbiochem, and constitutively active AMP-activated protein kinase was a generous gift from Dr. G. Lopaschuk (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). Protease inhibitor mixture and protein phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II were from Sigma. l-[methyl-14C]Carnitine was synthesized as described by Ingalls et al. (27Ingalls S.T. Hoppel C.L. Turkaly J.S. J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. 1982; 9: 365-372Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest commercially available purity. The matrix, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and calibration standards were purchased from Sigma. Isolation of Rat Liver Mitochondria and Rat Liver Mitochondrial Outer Membranes—Percoll-purified rat liver mitochondria were isolated as described in Ref. 28Hoppel C.L. Kerner J. Turkaly P.

Mitochondria were used to assay CPT-I activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity as described below or served as the starting material for isolation of mitochondrial outer membranes. High purity rat liver mitochondrial outer membranes were isolated by the swell/shrink technique and discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation as detailed elsewhere (29Hoppel C. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Tandler B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of the above protein phosphatase inhibitors and resuspended in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, supplemented or not with protein phosphatase inhibitors. Where indicated, crude outer membranes isolated in the absence of protein phosphatase inhibitors were treated by incubating the membrane fraction (6-8 mg of protein) for 30 min at room temperature with a mitochondrial matrix fraction (2.0 ml, 15 mg/ml) complemented with protease inhibitors at 1/100 dilution (Sigma) before discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. This step was included to dephosphorylate resident membrane proteins (30Signorile A.M. Sardanelli R. Nuzzi S. Papa S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rat Liver Mitochondrial Outer Membranes—In radiolabeling experiments 0.4 mg of dephosphorylated outer membranes were incubated in a 0.1-ml final volume for 60 min. at 37 °C. The composition and final concentration of the reaction mixtures were: mixture A, MOPS (25 mm), pH 7.0, MgCl2 (10 mm), DTT (5.0 mm), and protein kinase A (5 nmol/min); mixture B, Tris (25 mm), pH 7.4, MgCl2 (10 mm), DTT (5.0 mm), EGTA (1.0 mm), EDTA (1.0 mm), and AMP-activated kinase (3.5 nmol/min); mixture C, Hepes (50 mm), pH 7.4, MgCl2 (10 mm), DTT (1.0 mm), EGTA (1.0 mm), and protein kinase C (30 pmol/min); mixture D, Tris (20 mm), pH 7.4, MgCl2 (10 mm), CaCl2 (2.0 mm), calmodulin (0.24 μm), DTT (0.5 mm), and CaMII (1.0 nmol/min); mixture E, Tris (20 mm), pH 7.4, MgCl2 (10 mm), NaCl (50 mm), DTT (1.0 mm), and CKII (2.0 nmol/min). Protein kinase was omitted from the control incubation mixtures. All incubation mixtures also contained oligomycin (10 μg), 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (0.2 mm), protein phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II, and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma. Each was used at a 1/100-fold dilution. The reaction was stopped with 1.0 ml of cold 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and supplemented with protein phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and the membranes were recovered by centrifugation (30 min, 230,000 × g), solubilized in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 8 m urea, and 15-μl aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE separation. The separated polypeptides were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for autoradiography, and the same membranes were then probed with affinity-purified CPT-IL peptide antibodies by Western blotting. In experiments where the effect of phosphorylation on CPT-I activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity was assessed, dephosphorylated rat liver mitochondrial outer membranes (180 μg) were incubated with 1.8 μg of recombinant CKII in the presence of 5% glycerol and 2.5 mm ATP for 60 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 150 μl supplemented with protein phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II and protease inhibitor mixture at a 1/100-fold dilution. Controls were incubated as above either with 2.5 mm ATP alone or without CKII and ATP. For mass spectrometric analysis for CPT-I phosphorylation by CKII, the above experiment was scaled up using 1.0 mg of dephosphorylated rat liver outer membranes and 6.0 μg of recombinant CKII. Following incubation the membranes were collected by centrifugation, and the CPT-I was isolated by semipreparative SDS-PAGE and electroelution. Determination of CPT-I Activity—CPT-I activity was measured using the modified radiochemical forward assay and is expressed as the activity inhibited by 200 μm malonyl-CoA (28Hoppel C.L. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Turkaly J. Tandler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23495-23503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT-I was assessed by determining the IC50 values at 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA or by determining the Ki values at 25 and 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA concentrations. Malonyl-CoA concentrations are given in the appropriate figure legend (Figs. 1 and 8). Using isolated rat liver mitochondria or rat liver homogenate the assay was carried out in the absence and presence of the protein phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (10.0 mm), sodium orthovanadate (1.0 mm), sodium pyrophosphate (1.0 mm), and β-glycerophosphate (4 mm). Rat liver homogenate for CPT-I assay was prepared from powdered rat liver in 220 mm sucrose, 70 mm mannitol, 5 mm MOPS supplemented or not with sodium fluoride (40.0 mm), sodium orthovanadate (1.0 mm), sodium pyrophosphate (1.0 mm), and β-glycerophosphate (40 mm), pH 7.4 (31Vavvas D.

Depicted in B is the CPT-I activity in these mitochondrial outer membranes determined in the presence of 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isolation of CPT-IL—CPT-I was isolated from purified rat liver mitochondrial outer membranes by semipreparative SDS-PAGE as described for contact site proteins (29Hoppel C. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Tandler B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 392: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.0 mg of phosphorylated (prepared in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors), dephosphorylated (prepared in the absence of protein phosphatase inhibitors and exposed to matrix proteases as described above), and protein kinase CKII/ATP-treated dephosphorylated outer membranes were subjected to semipreparative SDS-PAGE; the separated polypeptides were visualized by brief staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, and the ≈88 kDa band corresponding to CPT-I was cut out and electroeluted (see Fig. 2). For tryptic digestion the electroeluted CPT-I was precipitated with ethanol (80%), and the precipitated protein was washed twice with 80% ethanol to remove excessive protein stain and subjected to reduction with DTT and carboxymethylation with iodoacetamide using standard protocols. Before tryptic treatment, excess reagents were removed by ethanol (80%) precipitation of CPT-I. Tryptic digestion of CPT-I isolated from 1.0 mg of mitochondrial outer membranes was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 1 mm CaCl2 with two additions of trypsin (1 μg each). Because precipitated, denatured CPT-I could not be resolubilized, the digestion was carried out with constant, gentle stirring of the reaction mixture. The tryptic digests were dried (Speed-Vac) and taken up in 50 μl of water (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-time-of-flight (TOF)) or 0.5% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (HPLC/nanospray electrospray ionization (ESI)) for subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analyses—CPT-IL isolated by semipreparative SDS-PAGE was subjected to analytical SDS-PAGE, and the CPT-I polypeptide was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with affinity-purified CPT-IL peptide antibodies or commercial mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against phosphoserine, -tyrosine, and -threonine. CPT-I was visualized colorimetrically as described earlier (26Hoppel C. Kerner J. Turkaly P. Minkler P. Tandler B. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescent detection. In the latter case, bovine serum albumin was used instead of fat-free dry milk, and 50 mm NaF was included in all buffers containing bovine serum albumin. Mass Spectrometry—The saturated matrix solution was made by dissolving α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in a 1:1 solution of acetonitrile and water. Samples were prepared by mixing 1 μl of analyte with 1 μl of matrix on a stainless steel sample plate. Reflectron MALDI mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) BiFlex III MALDI-TOF instrument equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse). All spectra were obtained in positive ionization mode using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Angiotensin II, ACTH clip (amino acids 18-39), and insulin were used as calibrants for these experiments. Electrospray spectra were acquired on ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca quadrupole ion trap or LTQ linear quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometers. Both systems used an Upchurch microinjector valve sample delivery system for sample introduction. Experimental results for the LTQ data were acquired using a PepMap C18 column from LC Packings (Sunnyvale, CA). The flow rate was ∼200 nl/min. The samples were diluted to a concentration of 100 fmol/μl, and 2 μl of the sample were injected. The mobile phases used were 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water and 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade acetonitrile. Sample analyses were performed using data-dependent/dynamic exclusion with a repeat count of one to maximize coverage. The LTQ method utilized eight data-dependent full ESI tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) scans following one full scan mass spectrum from 400 to 2000 Da. Analyses performed on the LCQ Deca were acquired using a C18 packed picofrit column purchased from New Objective, Inc. (Woburn, MA). The mobile phases used were 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade water and 0.1% formic acid in HPLC-grade acetonitrile. The LCQ method allowed for three full MS/MS scans following one full scan mass spectrum. All data files were searched against a rat subset taken from the NR data base. The rat subset was indexed with carboxymethylated cysteines. The results of the searches were filtered by removing all peptide matches containing an XCorr score lower than 1.0 regardless of charge state. As shown in Fig. 1A, when homogenates from quick-frozen rat liver were prepared in the presence of a mixture of broad range protein phosphatase inhibitors (PPIs) as described by Vavvas et al. (31Vavvas D. Apazidis A. Saha A.K. Gamble J. Patel A. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13255-13261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and were assayed in the presence of these PPIs, there was a significant decrease in CPT-I inhibition by 10 μm malonyl-CoA with no change in the apparent reaction velocity, reflecting a decreased sensitivity to inhibition by malonyl-CoA. Similar observations were made with mitochondria from rat livers isolated in the presence and absence of PPIs. As shown in Fig. 1B, when liver mitochondria are isolated in the presence of PPIs from fed rats, CPT-I in these mitochondria display decreased malonyl-CoA sensitivity (IC50 > 16 μm) when compared with mitochondria isolated in the absence of PPIs (IC50 4 μm) with no change in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although these data are consistent with regulation of CPT-I by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, an indirect effect of PPIs on CPT-I such as phosphorylation of extracellular components (21Guzman M.

To directly test whether CPT-IL is phosphorylated in vivo, we isolated rat liver mitochondrial outer membranes in the presence of PPIs as outlined in Fig. 2. The 88-kDa protein (boxed in Fig. 2) was harvested by semipreparative SDS-PAGE and electroelution. The isolated protein was then subjected to analytical SDS-PAGE and then blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was probed with affinity-purified CPT-IL-specific peptide antibodies to verify the identity of the electroeluted protein. As shown in Fig. 2, the isolated 88-kDa protein was readily recognized by CPT-IL-specific antibodies. Furthermore, the same protein also was readily recognized by mouse monoclonal phosphoserine antibodies, to a much lesser extent by antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, and barely (if at all) by antiphosphothreonine antibodies. These data obtained on CPT-IL isolated from rat liver mitochondrial outer membranes isolated in the presence of PPIs are consistent with phosphorylation of CPT-ILin vivo. With immunological evidence of CPT-I phosphorylation, the protein was evaluated for post-translational modifications using a mass spectrometric approach. Although the hydrophobicity of membrane proteins complicates mass spectrometric analyses, success has been reported with a variety of techniques. Intact membrane proteins have been studied using both MALDI (33Ghaim J.B. Tsatsos P.H. Katsonouri A. Mitchell D.M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Gennis R.B. Biochim. Biophys.

To determine the sequence of the protein and identify any post-translational modifications, a “bottom-up” approach to proteomics is often taken. For these experiments, isolated CPT-IL was ethanol precipitated, the cysteines were reduced and carboxymethylated, and the protein was subjected to tryptic digestion. Tryptic digests of membrane proteins yield hydrophobic peptides, especially those peptides from the membrane spanning region of the protein. Hydrophobic peptides have been studied successfully using both MALDI (37Green-Church K.B. Limbach P.A. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 5322-5325Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 38Breaux G.A.

Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. Sunner J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent publications have discussed the complementary nature of the two ionization methods to increase proteome coverage (42Bodnar W.M. Blackburn R.K. Krise J.M. Moseley M.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In our analyses, the resulting digests were examined by both MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) and ESI-quadrupole ion trap-MS using a nanospray source. The MALDI-TOF data provided a quick screening method for protein coverage, and the MS/MS experiments allowed for sequence determination of the tryptic peptides. The tryptic digest of the CPT-I protein was first analyzed using MALDI-TOF MS, Fig. 3. The mass fingerprint analysis of this spectrum yielded 74% coverage of the liver isoform of the protein. Although the mass fingerprint indicates the presence of the CPT-I protein, sequence information was needed as well. The sample was then analyzed using nanospray ESI interfaced to a Finnigan-LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer. The resulting total ion current chromatogram is shown in Fig. 4A. In this analysis, 62% coverage by mass was obtained for the protein with 473 of 773 amino acids being sequenced. To demonstrate the quality of the data used to sequence the tryptic peptides, MS/MS spectra for three different peptides are shown in Fig. 4, B-D. Fig. 4, B-D, includes the amino acid sequence of each peptide, the m/z value of the precursor ion, and the m/z value of the protonated peptide detected in the MALDI-TOF MS experiment. These peptides are labeled (b), (c), and (d) in the total ion current chromatogram, Fig. 4A. In Fig. 4B, the MS/MS spectrum of the peptide eluting at 19.86 min is shown. Fifteen of the 18 predicted ions were detected, allowing for coverage of all 10 amino acids of this peptide. In F"

Removal of glucose specifically induces the nuclear accumulation of green fluorescent protein-labeled Pap1 (GFP-Pap1) and the expression of genes dependent on this transcription factor. In contrast, depletion of the nitrogen source triggers the SAPK pathway but does not activate Pap1-dependent gene transcription, indicating that carbon stress rather than growth arrest leads to an endogenous oxidative condition that favors nuclear accumulation of Pap1. The reductant agents glutathione or N-acetylcysteine suppress the nuclear accumulation of GFP-Pap1 induced by glucose deprivation without inhibiting the activation of the MAPK Sty1. In addition, cells expressing a mutant GFP-Pap1 unable to accumulate into the nucleus upon hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative stress failed to show this protein into the nucleus in the absence of glucose. These results support the concept of a concerted action between the SAPK pathway and the Pap1 transcription factor during glucose exhaustion by which glucose limitation induces activation of the SAPK pathway prior to the oxidative stress caused by glucose deprivation. The ensuing induction of Atf1-dependent genes (catalase) decreases the level of hydroperoxides allowing Pap1 nuclear accumulation and function.

Glucose is a powerful signaling molecule that promotes major metabolic changes in cells (1Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Glucose metabolism produces compounds directly related to the detoxification of intracellular hydroperoxides formed as byproducts by ongoing metabolic processes (2Spitz D.R. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Galoforo S.S. Lee Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In human tumor cells, which typically show strong glycolysis and a reduced rate of respiration, deprivation of glucose causes a strong metabolic oxidative stress characterized by increased steady state levels of intracellular hydroperoxides and glutathione disulfide (3Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C. Davis B.H. Sim J.E. Corry P.M. Spitz D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5294-5299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Song J.J.

Strong evidence indicates that the absence of glucose also triggers signaling cascades that activate transcription factors and the expression of stress-related genes attempting to redirect cellular functions (2Spitz D.R. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Galoforo S.S. Lee Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Remarkably, glucose metabolism in some fermenting yeasts is quite similar to that of tumor cells. In particular, the Crabtree-positive fission yeast S. pombe ferments glucose under aerobic conditions. Unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this yeast lacks enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle that maintain diauxic growth after glucose depletion and utilizes very few non-sugar carbon sources (5Flores C. Rodriguez C. Petit T. Gancedo C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 507-529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Van Dijken J.P. Weusthuis R.A. Peonk J.T. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1993; 63: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, as soon as glucose disappears and respiration of the fermentation products is impaired, cultures of S. pombe may suffer nutritional stress.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 205-215Crossref Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 8Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2833) Google Scholar). These MAPK cascades are highly conserved through evolution and serve to transduce signals to the nucleus, resulting in new patterns of gene expression (9Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar, 10Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The identification of a highly conserved stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway in S. pombe allows us to analyze the mechanisms by which SAPKs are activated in a system more amenable than higher eukaryotic cells (11Warbrick E. Fantes P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4291-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14Kato T. Okazaki K.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2870-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In this yeast, the central element of the SAPK cascade is the MAPK Sty1 (also known as Spc1 or Phh1), which is highly homologous to mammalian p38 kinase and becomes activated by a similar series of stresses (12Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 15Degols G.

MAPK Sty1 is directly phosphorylated by MAPK kinase Wis1; however, the transmission pathway of the stress signal to Wis1 is dual, and either MAPK kinase kinase Wak1 (also known as Wis4 or Wik1) or MAPK kinase kinase Win1 is responsible for Wis1 phosphorylation (18Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). A response regulator protein, Mcs4, associates with Wak1, and probably with Win1, to regulate MAPK kinase kinase activity in response to several stimuli (17Shieh J.C. Wilkinson M.G. Buck V. Morgan B. Makino K. Millar J.B.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1008-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Buck V. Quinn J. Soto T. Martin H. Saldanha J. Makino K. Morgan B.A. Millar J.B.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In S. pombe different transcription factors function downstream of the MAPK Sty1 cascade, among which Atf1 and Pap1 have been studied extensively. Atf1 (also known as Gad7 or Mts1) is a mammalian ATF-2 homologue b-ZIP protein that associates to and is phosphorylated by Sty1 following different stresses (20Takeda T. Toda T. Kominami K. Kanoshu A. Yanagida M. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6193-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 21Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone M.W. Shieh J. Toda T. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In fact, Sty1 is the only known kinase involved in Atf1 phosphorylation during stress. Transcription of a wide array of stress-response genes like gpx1+ (coding for glutathione peroxidase), ntp1+ (neutral trehalase), ctt1+ (cytoplasmic catalase), fbp1+ (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase), or ste11+ (a high mobility group protein involved in the regulation of sexual differentiation) is controlled by Sty1 through Atf1 (21Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone M.W. Shieh J. Toda T. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Another transcription factor, Pap1, encoded by the pap1+ gene, has been isolated as required for survival to oxidative stress and, like its S. cerevisiae homologue YAP1, shows high homology to mammalian c-Jun (23Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). S. pombe cells deleted in pap1+ show high sensitivity to oxidative stress but not to osmotic stress or nutrient deprivation (24Toone W.M. Kige S. Samuels S. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Moreover, Pap1 activity is regulated at the level of cellular localization. In glucose-growing cells Pap1 localizes to the cytoplasm but accumulates in the cell nucleus upon oxidative stress with hydrogen peroxide or the glutathione-depleting agent diethyl maleate (DEM). Hydrogen peroxide reversibly oxidizes two cysteine residues in Pap1 (at positions 278 and 501), whereas DEM induces a non-reversible modification (25Castillo E.A. Ayté J. Chiva C. Moldón A. Carrascal M. Abián J. Jones N. Hidalgo E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As a result, modified Pap1 is unable to interact in both cases with the exportin Crm1 through the nuclear export signal located at the Pap1 carboxyl terminus (25Castillo E.A. Ayté J. Chiva C. Moldón A. Carrascal M. Abián J. Jones N. Hidalgo E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This favors its nuclear accumulation and the increased transcription of essential genes for defense against oxidative stress, like ctt1+ (catalase), trr1+ (thioredoxin reductase), or sod1+ (superoxide dismutase) (24Toone W.M. Kige S. Samuels S. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 26Mutoh N. Nakagawa C.W. Yamada K. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast to Atf1, Pap1 is neither phosphorylated nor a substrate for Sty1 upon stress conditions; however, Sty1 presence/function is needed for nuclear accumulation of Pap1 in response to high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but not at low concentrations of the prooxidant (27Quinn J. Findlay V.J. Dawson K. Millar J.B.A. Jones N. Morgan B.A. Toone W.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28Vivancos A.P. Castillo E.A. Jones N. Ayté J. Hidalgo E. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Several results have been reported previously that carbon starvation is an environmental stress able to activate the MAPK Sty1 in S. pombe (29Stettler S. Warbrick E. Prochnik S. Mackie S. Fantes P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Shiozaki K. Shiozaki M. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of the SAPK pathway to the cellular responses under glucose depletion after fermentative growth has not been investigated in detail. Transfer of cells from a glucose-rich to a glucose-free culture medium without an alternative carbon source may help to reveal characteristic responses normally masked under conditions of sugar availability or cell growth. Following such an approach we have analyzed the stress signal induced by glucose deprivation in cultures maintained under similar osmotic contexts to avoid the influence of stressing conditions unrelated to the absence of glucose. In this work we demonstrate that glucose limitation in S. pombe not only promotes activation of the SAPK signaling pathway that results in increased expression of Atf1-dependent stress-related genes but also induces an oxidative stress that favors the concerted expression of additional genes depending on the transcription factor Pap1. These results may help us to understand the mechanisms underlying the comparative resistance of glucose-depleted cells against external oxidative conditions.

To visualize the localization of a GFP-Pap1 fusion, we used strain EHH14, which harbors an integrated copy of the wild type GFP-Pap1 chimeric gene under the control of the thiamine-repressible promoter nmt1 (25Castillo E.A.

When indicated, reduced glutathione (GSH, 0.16 mm) or N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, 30 mm) was added (2Spitz D.R. Sim J.E. Ridnour L.A. Galoforo S.S. Lee Y.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Culture media were supplemented with adenine, leucine, histidine, or uracil (100 mg/liter, all obtained from Sigma) depending on the requirements for each particular strain. Transformation of yeast strains was performed by the lithium acetate method as described elsewhere (32Soto T. Beltrán F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M.

Purification and Detection of Activated Sty1-Ha6H and Atf1-Ha6H Proteins following Glucose Deprivation—Yeast cells grown in EMM2 with 7% glucose to an A600 of 0.5 (actual glucose concentration = 6%, determined by the glucose oxidase method) were recovered by filtration and resuspended in the same medium devoid of glucose.

At different times, the cells from 30 ml of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, and yeast pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

To analyze Sty1, total cell homogenates were prepared under native conditions employing chilled acid-washed glass beads and lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with specific protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma)). The lysates were removed and cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. Ha6H-tagged Sty1 was purified by using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen Inc.) as reported previously (32Soto T. Beltrán F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-10Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated with either mouse anti-Ha (Roche Applied Science, clone 12CA5) or mouse antiphospho-p38 (New England Biolabs) antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were revealed with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For Atf1-Ha6H purification, the pelleted cells were lysed into denaturing lysis buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0), and the Atf1 protein was isolated by affinity precipitation on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads as described previously (34Shiozaki K. Russell P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 503-520Google Scholar). The purified proteins were resolved in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated with a mouse anti-Ha antibody (12CA5). RNA Isolation and Hybridization—Yeast cells grown in EMM2 with 7% glucose to an A600 of 0.5 were recovered by filtration and resuspended in the same medium with 3% glycerol. Volumes of 50 ml of the cultures were recovered at different times, and total RNA preparations were obtained as described by Franco et al. (35Franco A. Soto T. Vicente-Soler J. Guillén P.V. Cansado J. Gacto M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5880-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and resolved through 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels. Northern (RNA)-hybridization analyses were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). The probes employed were amplified by PCR and included the following: a 0.7-kbp fragment of the apt1+ gene (23Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) that was amplified with the 5′-oligonucleotide CCCAGTATGTCTACC and the 3′-oligonucleotide AAGTCTTACTTGCGG, a 0.4-kbp fragment of the gpx1+ gene (37Yamada K. Nakagawa C.W. Mutoh N. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) amplified with the 5′-oligonucleotide TTCTACGACTTGGCT and the 3′-oligonucleotide ACACTCTCGATATCG, a 0.9-kbp fragment of the trr1+ gene (38Benko Z. Miklos I. Carr A.M. Sipiczki M. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) amplified with the 5′-oligonucleotide GTGACTCACAACAAG and the 3′-oligonucleotide TAATCGGTATCTTCC, a 2.1-kbp fragment of the pyp2+ gene (12Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) amplified with the 5′-oligonucleotide CCGAGAGCGTTTCTTGGA and the 3′-oligonucleotide AAGGGCTTGGAAGCCTGG, and a 1-kbp fragment of the fbp1+ gene (39Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1990; 124: 807-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) amplified with the 5′-oligonucleotide CTTCCAAGCCAAATACTG and the 3′-oligonucleotide GATCTCGACGAAATCGAC. Probes for ctt1+ and leu1+ were prepared as reported previously (32Soto T. Beltrán F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-10Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). To establish quantitative conclusions, the level of mRNAs was determined in a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and compared with the internal control (leu1+ mRNA). Fluorescence Microscopy—To localize the GFP-Pap1 fusion, yeast cultures were grown in EMM2 with 7% glucose (with or without GSH and NAC) to an A600 of 0.5, recovered by filtration, and resuspended in the same medium with 6% glucose but lacking the nitrogen source (EMM2-N), 3% glycerol, 6% sorbitol, or 0.01–0.1% glucose plus 3% glycerol. Treatment with DEM was performed by adding the compound to glucose-growing cells at a final concentration of 4 mm. Small aliquots (10 μl) of the yeast cultures were loaded onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and the remaining suspension was withdrawn by aspiration. For nuclear staining, 3 μl of Hoechst in 50% glycerol was added. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Leica DM 4000B microscope with a ×100 objective. Images were captured with a cooled Leica DC 300F camera and IM50 software and then imported into Adobe PhotoShop 6.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Cell Viability Assays and Analytical Determinations—Yeast strains grown in YES medium (2% glucose and 0.6% yeast extract) with 7% glucose to an A600 of 0.5 were recovered by filtration, resuspended for 1hat28 °C in the same medium with either 6% glucose or 3% glycerol, and treated for 1 h with 80 mm H2O2. The samples were diluted and spread in triplicate onto plates containing YES solid medium, and cell viability was measured by their ability to form colonies on this medium after incubation at 28 °C for 5 days. Results represent the mean values ± S.D. from three different experiments. Glucose concentration in the growth media was assayed by the glucose oxidase method (40Carrillo C. Vicente-Soler J. Gacto M. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein determination was performed according to Lowry et al. (41Lowry O.H. Rosegrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SAPK Activation during Glucose Depletion—We first analyzed the kinetics of Sty1 activation due to glucose exhaustion. An exponentially glucose-growing culture of strain JM1521, which harbors a genomic copy of sty1+ tagged with two copies of the Ha epitope and six histidine residues (32Soto T. Beltrán F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-10Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar), was shifted to a similar medium containing a non-assimilated carbon source (glycerol or sorbitol) instead of glucose. It should be noted that S. pombe does not feed on glycerol alone unless glucose is present for initial growth (42Higuchi T. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) 2M. Madrid, T. Soto, A. Franco, V. Paredes, J. Vicente, E. Hidalgo, M. Gacto, and J. Cansado, unpublished observations. and that sorbitol is not a carbon source for this yeast (43Burnett J.A. Payne R.V. Yarrow D. Yeasts: Characteristics and Identification. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1983: 484Google Scholar) either. These compounds were used to prevent drastic osmotic changes in the non-glucose-containing medium and, hence, to avoid any potential disturbance of the SAPK pathway unrelated to glucose deprivation (44Bone N. Millar J.B. Toda T. Armstrong J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Samples were collected at different times from the new medium. Sty1-HA6H protein was purified by affinity chromatography, and its activation was analyzed by Western immunoblotting using antiphospho-p38 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A and confirming previous reports (30Shiozaki K. Shiozaki M. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the absence of glucose provoked a clear peak of activation of Sty1, with maximal phosphorylation at 5 min, followed by a rather slight decrease. The occurrence of a rapid Sty1-mediated response during the transition from glucose to non-glucose conditions led us to assess the phosphorylation status of the downstream transcription factor Atf1. This was performed by employing strain JM1821, which carries a genomic copy of the atf1+ gene tagged with two copies of the Ha epitope and six histidine residues (32Soto T. Beltrán F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-10Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Earlier studies demonstrated that Atf1 of unstressed cells migrates in gel as a single protein of ∼85 kDa that undergoes a phosphorylation-dependent band shift under different stresses (32Soto T. Beltrán F.F. Paredes V. Madrid M. Millar J.B.A. Vicente-Soler J. Cansado J. Gacto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1-10Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, glucose deprivation induced a Sty1-dependent band shift in the migration of Atf1 because of in vivo phosphorylation, whose initial kinetics matched closely that observed for Sty1 phosphorylation. Essentially identical results were obtained when sorbitol was used to balance osmolarity (Fig. 1D), confirming that the activation of the SAPK pathway is exclusively due to glucose limitation. To clarify whether SAPK activation was triggered only after a complete exhaustion of glucose, we further analyzed the glucose deprivation-induced phosphorylation of Sty1/Atf1. As shown in Fig. 1, B and E, a switch from high glucose-containing medium to osmotically equilibrated medium (containing glycerol or sorbitol) with glucose concentrations of 1% (w/v) or higher (not shown) did not induce Sty1/Atf1 phosphorylation. However, lower glucose concentrations (0.5% or less) prompted a rapid and transient increase in both Sty1 and Atf1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, C and F) that was almost identical to that observed after complete glucose depletion (Fig. 1, A and D). Similar results were obtained when yeast cultures reached the early stationary phase of growth. 3E. Hidalgo, unpublished results. Hence, these data demonstrate that the activation of the SAPK pathway in S. pombe by a downshift in glucose concentration takes place even in the presence of a certain a"

This work reports the mutagenicity of oxanine as well as oxanine DNA glycosylase (ODG) activities in mammalian systems. Using human DNA polymerase β, deoxyoxanosine triphosphate is only incorporated opposite cytosine (Cyt). When an oxanine base is in a DNA template, Cyt is efficiently incorporated opposite the template oxanine; however, adenine and thymine are also incorporated opposite Oxa with an efficiency ∼80% of a Cyt/Oxa (C/O) base pair. Guanine is incorporated opposite Oxa with the least efficiency, 16% compared with cytosine. ODG activity was detected in several mammalian cell extracts. Among the known human DNA glycosylases tested, human alkyladenine glycosylase (AAG) shows ODG activity, whereas hOGG1, hNEIL1, or hNEIL2 did not. ODG activity was detected in spleen cell extracts of wild type age-matched mice, but little activity was observed in that of Aag knock-out mice, confirming that the ODG activity is intrinsic to AAG. Human AAG can excise Oxa from all four Oxa-containing double-stranded base pairs, Cyt/Oxa, Thy/Oxa, Ade/Oxa, and Gua/Oxa, with no preference to base pairing. Surprisingly, AAG can remove Oxa from single-stranded Oxa-containing DNA as well. Indeed, AAG can also remove 1,N6-ethenoadenine from single-stranded DNA. This study extends the deaminated base glycosylase activities of AAG to oxanine; thus, AAG is a mammalian enzyme that can act on all three purine deamination bases, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and oxanine.

The rate of base deamination is accelerated by aberrant sequence contexts or high temperature (5Karran P. Lindahl T.

Hypoxanthine (Hyp), xanthine (Xan), uracil (Ura), and thymine (Thy) are the corresponding deamination products derived from Ade, Gua, Cyt, and 5-MeC, respectively. Previous studies suggested that xanthine in DNA is prone to spontaneous depurination because of the instability of the C′–N glycosidic bond (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar, 7Suzuki T. Matsumura Y. Ide H. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8013-8019Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); however, a more recent study indicates that Xan is a stable lesion in DNA under physiological conditions (8Vongchampa V. Dong M. Gingipalli L. Dedon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Wuenschell G.E. O'Connor T.R. Termini J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3608-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Treatment of deoxyguanosine or DNA by nitrous acid, nitric oxide, or 1-nitrosoindole-3-acetonitrile also yields an intracyclic guanine deamination product, oxanine (Oxa), in which the N1-nitrogen is substituted by an oxygen atom (10Lucas L.T.

Soc. 1996; 118: 2515-2516Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A chemical pathway leading to the formation of xanthine and oxanine from guanine by nitrous acid treatment has been proposed based on the isolation of a diazoate intermediate (12Suzuki T. Ide H. Yamada M. Endo N. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Morii T. Makino K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Oxanine in DNA is as stable as guanine by comparison of spontaneous hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond (7Suzuki T. Matsumura Y. Ide H. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8013-8019Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All deaminated base lesions are promutagenic as demonstrated by in vitro DNA polymerase studies. Uracil, as the deamination product of cytosine, pairs with adenine, causing Cyt to Thy transitions (13Duncan B.K. Miller J.H. Nature. 1980; 287: 560-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 14Coulondre C. Miller J.H. Farabaugh P.J. Gilbert W. Nature. 1978; 274: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The mutagenic potential of xanthine is more controversial. Earlier studies (15Eritja R. Horowitz D.M. Walker P.A. Ziehler-Martin J.P. Boosalis M.S. Goodman M.F. Itakura K. Kaplan B.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8135-8153Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Kamiya H. Sakaguchi T. Murata N. Fujimuro M. Miura H. Ishikawa H. Shimizu M. Inoue H. Nishimura S. Matsukage A. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Ohtsuka E. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1992; 40: 2792-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) indicate that Thy can pair with Xan to produce G/C to A/T transitions. However, a more recent study (17Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11592-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggests that dXTP is not incorporated opposite Thy, although the incorporation efficiency of dXTP opposite Cyt is approximately 15,000-fold less than that of dGTP to Cyt. When Xan is placed in a DNA template, the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli polymerase I inserts a dCTP to pair with Xan, whereas the reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus inserts a Cyt or Thy with similar efficiencies (9Wuenschell G.E. O'Connor T.R. Termini J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3608-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). dOTP can be incorporated to pair with both a Cyt or Thy in DNA by the Klenow fragment, thus generating G/C to A/T transitions (17Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11592-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Xanthine DNA glycosylase activities of E. coli AlkA and endo VIII proteins have been reported (9Wuenschell G.E. O'Connor T.R. Termini J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3608-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Terato H. Masaoka A. Asagoshi K. Honsho A. Ohyama Y. Suzuki T. Yamada M. Makino K. Yamamoto K. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4975-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). E. coli endo V has been shown to have deoxyxanthosine endonuclease activity (19Schouten K.A. Weiss B. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20He B. Qing H. Kow Y.W. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Human alkyladenine glycosylase (AAG, also called MPG for methylpurine DNA glycosylase) has also been shown to have xanthine DNA glycosylase activity 2L. Dong and W. Cao, unpublished data.2L. Dong and W. Cao, unpublished data. (9Wuenschell G.E. O'Connor T.R. Termini J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3608-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). E. coli AlkA and endo VIII contain some glycosylase activity to remove mutagenic oxanine from DNA, but it appears that a large excess of glycosylase proteins is needed to detect limited activities (18Terato H. Masaoka A. Asagoshi K. Honsho A. Ohyama Y. Suzuki T. Yamada M. Makino K. Yamamoto K. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4975-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To understand the mutagenicity and potential oxanine DNA glycosylase activities in mammalian systems, we investigated Oxa-containing incorporation by human DNA polymerase β. Although dOTP was preferentially incorporated to pair with a Cyt-containing template, dCTP, dATP, dTTP, and to a much lesser extent, dGTP were incorporated to pair with an Oxa-containing template. To identify enzymes that may act on oxanine in mammalian cells, we examined oxanine DNA glycosylase activities of mammalian cell extracts and of known human DNA glycosylases. ODG activity was detected in cell extracts and purified human AAG. The absence of obvious ODG activity in Aag knock-out mouse spleen tissues suggests that AAG is a major oxanine glycosylase in mammalian cells. Human AAG can act on C/O, T/O, A/O, and G/O base pairs as well as single-stranded Oxa-containing DNA. Separation of Nucleotides by RP-HPLC—Deoxyoxanosine 3′-triphosphate was generated by incubating 10 mm deoxyguanosine 3′-triphosphate (Sigma) with 100 mm NaNO2 in 3 m acetate buffer (pH 3.7) in a final volume of 100 μl at 37 °C for 2 h. The resulting deamination products were separated on a Nova-Pak C18 ODS column (4 μm, 3.9 × 150 mm inner diameter, Waters) by RP-HPLC using a linear gradient (0–20% acetonitrile, 20 min) in a 100 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate TEAB) buffer (Fluka) at pH 7.0, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml/tube) with absorbance at 260 nm were scanned from 220 to 360 nm using a 1700 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Nucleotide identities were verified by comparing with unique UV signatures of known compounds (17Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11592-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Construction of Oxanosine-containing Oligonucleotide Substrates—A single-nucleotide gap substrate contained two deoxyoligonucleotides (1.5-fold in excess), EV38N.BD (23-mer) and EV35C.T (66-mer), with a 36-mer 5′-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled deoxyoligonucleotide (EV37N.BU) (see Fig. 1). A duplex 1-nucleotide gap was formed by incubating the three oligonucleotides at 85 °C for 3 min and allowing them to anneal at room temperature for at least 30 min. The single-nucleotide extension reaction was performed at 37 °C for 60 min in a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 20 μm dOTP, 5 μm duplex 1-nucleotide gap substrate, 1× EcoPol buffer (New England Biolabs), and 6 units of Klenow fragment (3′-exo-). The reaction mixture was concentrated 4-fold by Speedvac, supplemented with an equal volume of formamide, and heated to 55 °C for 5 min immediately prior to loading. The resulting 37-nucleotide extension product was separated from the substrate by electrophoresis on a 7 m urea-16% denaturing PAGE gel at 250 V for 18 h using a Bio-Rad Protean IIXi apparatus. The oligonucleotides were excised under UV shadowing and desalted by Sep-pak C18 column (Waters) (21Inc Applied Biosystems The Complete Guide: Evaluating and Isolating Synthetic Oligonucleotides. Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA1992Google Scholar). The Oxa-containing 37-mer was annealed to the 66-mer template (EV35C.T) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in a 150-μl reaction mixture containing 100 μm each dNTP, 5 μm substrate, 1× EcoPol buffer, and 6 units of Klenow fragment (3′-exo-). The resulting full-length 62-mer oligonucleotide was again purified by denaturing PAGE as described previously. This Oxa-containing strand (1 μm) was annealed with a 66-mer complementary strand (2 μm) to form C/O, T/O, A/O, and G/O base pairs. Mutagenicity of Oxanine as a Deoxynucleotide and in DNA—Single-nucleotide extension reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in a 10-μl volume containing 10 nm single-nucleotide gap substrate (EV35C.T annealed with EV38N.BD and EV37N.BU, see Fig. 1 for sequences), 50 μm dOTP or other dNTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol, and 1 nm polymerase β. Reactions were quenched by addition of an equal volume of GeneScan stop buffer. Electrophoresis and quantitative analyses were performed as described under “DNA Glycosylase Activity Assays” below. To study the potential incorporation of dNTP on an Oxa-containing template by human polymerase β, extension reactions were carried out as described previously except that the substrate was a single-nucleotide gap with the Oxa-containing strand as a template. Preparation of Mammalian Cell Extracts—Pig thymus tissues (390 g) were homogenized in a Waring blender with 200 ml of extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin at 4 °C. The extract was diluted by adding 500 ml of extraction buffer and then filtered through cheesecloth. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min in a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-25 centrifuge. Proteins were precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation. After dialysis using a Spectrum Spectra/Por 10-kDa membrane against the dialysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT, the supernatant was precipitated by stepwise ammonium sulfate saturation from 20 to 80%, with 10% increments. Aag–/– and matched Aag+/+ mouse tissues were thawed on ice in 2.5 volumes of glycosylase assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol as described previously (22Engelward B.P.

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. The supernatants were stored at –70 °C prior to glycosylase activity assays. DNA Glycosylase Activity Assays—Purification of human AAG proteins was carried out as described previously (23Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.

DNA glycosylase cleavage assays were performed at 37 °C for 60 min in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 10 nm oligonucleotide substrate, an indicated amount of glycosylase, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol as described previously (22Engelward B.P. Weeda G. Wyatt M.D. Broekhof J.L. de Wit J. Donker I. Allan J.M. Gold B. Hoeijmakers J.H. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13087-13092Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The resulting abasic sites were cleaved by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min after adding 0.5 μl of 1 n NaOH. Reactions were quenched by addition of an equal volume of GeneScan stop buffer. Samples (3.5 μl) were loaded onto a 7 m urea-10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was conducted at 1500 V for 1.6 h using an ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Cleavage products and remaining substrates were quantified using GeneScan analysis software. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—The binding reactions were performed at 37 °C for 30 min in a 10-μl volume containing 50 nm DNA substrate, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and the indicated amount of hAAG (Δ54-E125Q). Samples were supplemented with 5 μl of 50% glycerol and electrophoresed at 200 V on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 1× TB buffer (89 mm Tris base and 89 mm boric acid) supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. The bound and free DNA species were analyzed using a Typhoon 9400 Imager (Molecular Dynamics) with the settings, photomultiplier tube at 600 V, excitation at 495 nm, and emission at 535 nm. Preparation of dOTP and Oxa-containing DNA—Oxanine is a newly identified deamination product of guanine (11Suzuki T. Yamaoka R. Nishi M. Ide H. Makino K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2515-2516Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To generate dOTP, dGTP was treated with 100 mm NaNO2 in 3 m acetate buffer (pH 3.7). Similar to a previous report (17Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11592-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this reaction produced approximately 40% dXTP and 10% dOTP, respectively (Fig. 1A). Peaks corresponding to dGTP, dXTP, and dOTP were identified by their unique UV spectra (Fig. 1A, insets). Deoxyoxanosine triphosphate was separated at base line level from other products by RP-HPLC, collected, lyophilized, and stored at –80 °C (17Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11592-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Oxa base was incorporated into DNA by a single-nucleotide gap fill-in reaction using Klenow fragment (Fig. 1, B and C). The Oxa-containing 37-mer was purified by denaturing PAGE, reannealed to the top template strand, and extended to full length. Extension products were verified by GeneScan analysis using 10% denaturing PAGE (Fig. 1D). Mutagenicity of Oxanine—We determined the possibility of incorporation of dOTP to DNA using a single-nucleotide gap substrate. In control reactions, human DNA polymerase β extended Gua, Cyt, Ade, and Thy fully to form corresponding Watson-Crick base pairs (Fig. 2A). dOTP was only incorporated opposite a template Cyt with approximately 60% of the efficiency of dGTP. dOTP was not detectably incorporated opposite the other template bases (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained on a primer-template substrate when the downstream 23-mer was omitted (data not shown). These results suggest that human polymerase β preferentially incorporates dOTP to pair with the cognate Cyt template. To determine the mutagenicity of an Oxa base in DNA, a single-nucleotide gap substrate was formed by annealing the Oxa-containing template with two complementary top strands (Fig. 2B). Human polymerase β incorporated all four nucleotides to pair with the Oxa template with varying efficiency (Fig. 2B). The incorporation of Cyt opposite Oxa was close to completion, whereas dATP and dTTP were incorporated ∼80% as efficiently as dCTP (Fig. 2B). The incorporation of the Gua base was poor, generating ∼16% misincorporation product. The Oxa base was not incorporated to pair with Oxa template by human polymerase β. Oxanine DNA Glycosylase Activities in Mammalian Cells— Given that small base modifications in general are recognized by DNA glycosylases (25Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar), we decided to determine whether there was a DNA glycosylase with activity toward oxanine. Total proteins from pig thymus tissues were extracted and fractionated by stepwise ammonium sulfate precipitation. ODG activities were assayed using C/O and T/O substrates (Fig. 3). DNA cleavage corresponding to an approximately 36-mer fragment was observed primarily in 30–60% ammonium sulfate fractions for both C/O and T/O substrates, with the highest activities appearing at the 50% fraction. No DNA cleavage at a corresponding location was observed in the non-Oxa-containing DNA (Fig. 3, T/A lanes). The ODG activities were observed in similar fractions in calf liver tissues (data not shown). These results indicate that mammalian cells possess DNA glycosylases that contain ODG activities. To identify which human DNA glycosylases excise oxanine, we tested purified glycosylases that are known to recognize damaged purines, including hOGG1, hNEIL1, hNEIL2, and hAAG. E. coli endo VIII, FaPy-DNA glycosolase (MutM), hOGG1, hNEIL1, and hNEIL2 but not mouse methylpurine DNA glycosylase are known to form cross-linking products with oxanine (26Nakano T. Terato H.

Under our assay conditions, human AAG was the only enzyme that showed oxanine DNA glycosylase activity (Fig. 4A). AAG versions with N-terminal 54 (Δ54) and 79 (Δ79) amino acid truncations are commonly used for biochemical studies (24Connor E.E. Wyatt M.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); an AAG protein with a truncation of the first 100 amino acids still retains glycosylase activity (30Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G. Grabowski D.T. Izumi T. Srinivasan G. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 54 (Δ54) and 79 (Δ79) versions of hAAG showed comparable ODG activity. An inosine-containing substrate (T/I) was used as a positive control, which was cleaved near completion (Fig. 4A). To rule out the possibility that the observed cleavage activities may come from E. coli expression host contamination, assays were performed with an active site mutant Δ54-E125Q. This mutant is catalytically inactive because of the change of a proposed general base residue Glu to Gln (24Connor E.E. Wyatt M.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31673-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). No DNA cleavage was observed from Δ54-E125Q, indicating that the ODG activities are intrinsic to hAAG (Fig. 4A). N169S is a mutant that enhances DNA cleavage activities (24Connor E.E. Wyatt M.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As expected, ODG activities were detected with this mutant. To verify that the AAG is the authentic oxanine glycosylase in mammalian cells, we assayed oxanine cleavage in mouse Aag knock-out (KO) (Aag–/–) tissues. G/U, T/I, and C/I substrates were used to examine assay methodology in both KO and age-matched wild type spleen tissues. As expected, uracil DNA glycosylase activities were readily detected in both KO and wild type tissues (Fig. 4B). Cleavage of inosine in the T/I base pair was primarily observed in the wild type spleen tissue, consistent with previous reports (22Engelward B.P. Weeda G. Wyatt M.D. Broekhof J.L. de Wit J. Donker I. Allan J.M. Gold B. Hoeijmakers J.H. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13087-13092Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 34Hang B. Singer B. Margison G.P. Elder R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12869-12874Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) that AAG is a major hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase in mammalian cells. In keeping with the preferential cleavage of the T/I base pair by purified mammalian AAG (28Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13379-13387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Wyatt M.D. Samson L.D. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), little C/I cleavage activity was observed in the wild type cell extract (Fig. 4B). The band above the specific cleavage band at 36-mer was probably generated by other unidentified cleavage activities in cell extracts. Cleavage of both T/O and C/O substrates was detected in the wild type tissue, but little cleavage was observed in the KO tissue. These results suggest that AAG is a major oxanine DNA glycosylase in mammalian systems. ODG Activity from hAAG—Initial experiments showed that hAAG was active toward any Oxa-containing base pair (Fig. 4A). To compare the effect of opposite bases on cleavage, we studied the cleavage kinetics using substrate in excess (enzyme:substrate (E:S) ratio of 1:10), E:S in equal molar ratio (E:S = 1:1), and enzyme in excess (E:S = 10:1). When the substrate was in excess, cleavage of N/O (N = Cyt, Thy, Ade, Gua) base pairs was approximately 2%, similar to the cleavage of the T/I substrate (Fig. 5, A and C). When the E:S ratio was raised to 1:1, the cleavage of N/O or T/I reached ∼10%. There was no significant difference in cleavage rate among the four Oxa-containing base pairs (data not shown). The apparent rate constants were approximately 0.44 min–1 for N/O compared with 0.42 min–1 for T/I (Fig. 5). Excess of enzyme (E:S = 10:1) increased the cleavage of the N/O substrates to ∼30%. Cleavage of T/I substrate approached completion in a 60-min incubation period (Fig. 5C), in keeping with a previous analysis (28Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13379-13387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We then compared the binding affinity of hAAG to the Oxa-containing substrates. Unlike the weak binding to the C/I base pair (Ref. 28Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13379-13387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and Fig. S1 in Supplemental Data), binding to the C/O substrate was strong (Fig. 5B). Because the substrate-containing DNA was long (62-mer), hAAG forms a primary complex (ES) at low enzyme concentrations and secondary complexes (EnS) at higher enzyme concentrations. The apparent Kd values for the primary complex ranged from 115 nm for C/O and 160 nm for T/O to 180 nm for A/O and G/O. Under the same assay conditions, the apparent Kd value for T/I was approximately 460 nm (Fig. 5D). Evidently, there is no significant difference in binding affinity among the four Oxa-containing substrates. Based on the observation that hAAG does not show significant preference in cleavage and binding to double-stranded Oxa-containing DNA, we determined the cleavage and binding to single-stranded Oxa-containing DNA. The cleavage patterns for the single-stranded Oxa substrate did not deviate much compared with the double-stranded Oxa substrates (Figs. 5E). The apparent rate constant for the single-stranded Oxa substrate assayed under the same conditions was approximately 0.42 min–1, a value very similar to the double-stranded Oxa substrates. Likewise, hAAG showed comparable binding affinity to the single-stranded Oxa substrate, with an apparent Kd value of 130 nm under the same assay conditions (Fig. 5F). On the other hand, the cleavage and binding to single-stranded inosine-containing DNA were barely detectable, even at high enzyme concentrations (Fig. S1 in Supplemental Data). This represents a significant biochemical difference between the two deaminated bases. Oxanine is a newly discovered stable base lesion derived from deamination of guanine. This work investigates the mutagenicity and potential oxanine DNA glycosylase activities in mammalian systems. The potential of oxanine to mispair is addressed by in vitro studies as reported previously using Klenow fragment (17Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11592-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and, in this study, using human polymerase β (Fig. 2). Oxanine nucleotide triphosphate appears to be misinserted opposite thymine in DNA by a Klenow fragment, which would result in A/T to G/C mutations (17Suzuki T. Yoshida M. Yamada M. Ide H. Kobayashi M. Kanaori K. Tajima K. Makino K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11592-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Klenow fragment also incorporates nucleotides to mispair with oxanine in DNA, 3Hitchcock, T. M., Gao, H., and Cao, W. (2004) Nucl. Acids Res. 32, 4071–4080. suggesting that oxanine is promutagenic in either nucleotide or DNA. Human polymerase β appears to preferentially insert dOTP to pair with Cyt in DNA (Fig. 2). However, oxanine in the DNA template is more mutagenic, as manifested by incorporation of Cyt, Thy, Ade, and, to a lesser extent, Gua opposite Oxa in DNA by human polymerase β (Fig. 2). Thus, the mispairing property of oxanine in the DNA template appears broader than the natural universal base, hypoxanthine, which pairs primarily with Cyt and Ade (38Hoops G.C. Zhang P. Johnson W.T. Paul N. Bergstrom D.E. Davisson V.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4866-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mammalian AAGs are broad substrate enzymes that act on alkylated or cyclic alkylated and deaminated bases (39Wyatt M.D. Allan J.M. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T.E. Samson L.D. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition to 3-methyladenine, 7-methylguanine, 1,N6-ethenoadenine (ϵA), and hypoxanthine, xanthine is also found as a substrate for hAAG (9Wuenschell G.E. O'Connor T.R. Termini J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3608-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Removal of 1,N2-ethenoguanine (ϵG), however, appears to require full-length AAG (40Saparbaev M. Langouet S. Privezentzev C.V. Guengerich F.P. Cai H. Elder R.H. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26987-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of Δ79-AAG complexed with the abasic pyrrolidine inhibitor or with ϵA provide important insights on base discrimination and catalytic mechanisms (23Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 29Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the active site appears to act more to discriminate against the normal purines than to specifically recognize the damaged purines. One key feature of this discrimination in the active site is the potential steric clash between Asn-169 of AAG and the N2-amino group of guanine (24Connor E.E. Wyatt M.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The damaged adenine derivatives 3-methylA, ϵA, and hypoxanthine lack the N2-amino group. Discrimination against adenine is accomplished by the main chain amide of His-136 (29Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, how guanine-derived substrates xanthine, oxanine, 7-methylG, and ϵG occupy the AAG active site is not understood. A subtle conformational adjustment appears to be needed to accommodate the N2-amino group of xanthine, oxanine and 7-methylG without clashing with Asn-169, while maintaining strong discrimination against guanine. A more substantial conformational change, which involves the nonconserved N-terminal region, may be needed to prevent a steric clash caused by the bulkier ϵG. The cleavage and binding of Oxa-containing double-stranded DNA by AAG are essentially independent of the opposite base. In fact, the ODG activity of AAG does not require a complementary strand at all, as evidenced by similar cleavage and binding of single-stranded DNA (Fig. 5, A, B, E, and F). Cleavage and binding of ϵA in double-stranded DNA are also independent of opposite pyrimidine bases (28Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13379-13387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 37Wyatt M.D. Samson L.D. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We subsequently tested the excision of ϵA from single-stranded DNA. Indeed, AAG can excise ϵA from single-stranded DNA, albeit with compromised efficiency compared with ϵA from double-stranded DNA (Fig. S2 in Supplemental Data). These observations are in stark contrast with hypoxanthine-containing DNA. Removal of hypoxanthine is highly dependent on the opposite base. The T/I base pair is a very good substrate for AAG, but C/I is a poor one (Refs. 28Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13379-13387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 35Saparbaev M. Mani J.C. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1332-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Dianov G. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Wyatt M.D. Samson L.D. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar and Fig. S1 in Supplemental Data). At least part of the poor activity of C/I can be attributed to weak binding by AAG (Ref. 28Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13379-13387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and Fig. S1 in Supplemental Data). There is little cleavage of single-stranded inosine-containing DNA by AAG (Ref. 41Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar and Fig. S1 in Supplemental Data), suggesting that the interactions with the complementary strand are important for the cleavage of the inosine-containing substrates. Human AAG preferentially removes 7-methylG opposite Thy over Cyt (33O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and shows very poor activity on single-stranded 7-methylG-containing DNA. 4P. J. O'Brien and T. Ellenberger, personal communication. It appears that AAG exhibits two modes of interaction with its alkylated and deaminated base substrates, as classified by its ability to remove lesions in single-stranded DNA. The first mode of interaction can be represented by oxanine and ϵA. AAG can recognize these lesions in single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, the identity of the DNA base opposing these lesions does not severely affect excision of the lesion. The second mode of interaction can be exemplified by hypoxanthine and 7-methylguanine. Recognition and excision of these lesions are highly dependent on the double-stranded structure and highly sensitive to the identity of the base opposite of the lesion. ODG activities dealing with Oxa-containing lesions appear to be ubiquitous in nature. AlkA, similar to hAAG, is a broad substrate DNA glycosylase that can remove alkylated and deaminated bases. However, the deaminated base DNA glycosylase activities of E. coli AlkA seem low compared with its alkylbase DNA glycosylase activities (18Terato H. Masaoka A. Asagoshi K. Honsho A. Ohyama Y.

A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Endonuclease VIII is a DNA glycosylase that removes oxidative base lesions (42Wallace S.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 43Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Venkataraman R. Kow Y.W. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27762-27767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Compared with other lesions, the ODG activities of both AlkA and endo VIII are quite low (18Terato H. Masaoka A. Asagoshi K. Honsho A. Ohyama Y. Suzuki T. Yamada M. Makino K. Yamamoto K. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4975-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Enzyme in excess (30-fold) is required to detect cleavage products (18Terato H. Masaoka A. Asagoshi K. Honsho A. Ohyama Y. Suzuki T. Yamada M. Makino K. Yamamoto K. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4975-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is reported (18Terato H. Masaoka A. Asagoshi K. Honsho A. Ohyama Y. Suzuki T. Yamada M. Makino K. Yamamoto K. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4975-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that both AlkA and endo VIII preferentially remove oxanine from A/O, C/O, and G/O base pairs. Both enzymes show even poorer activities for the T/O base pair. This study demonstrates that the ODG activity of hAAG is more robust than E. coli AlkA, in keeping with the previous observation of higher hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase activity in hAAG (41Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Another distinct feature of human AAG is that it shows no preference to Oxa-containing base pairs. It has been suggested that AAG evolved from a hypoxanthine-specific DNA glycosylase to a broader substrate enzyme (33O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9750-9757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 44Aamodt R.M. Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. Bjoras M. J. Biol.

Phosphatidylcholine synthesis increases in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts during the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. Previous studies demonstrated that the mRNA encoding CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CTα) increases during S phase (Golfman, L. S., Bakovic, M., and Vance, D. E. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 43688-43692) and that this activation is driven by increased binding of Sp1 to the CTα promoter (Banchio, C., Schang, L. M., and Vance, D. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 32457-32464). We now demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) phosphorylation of Sp1 activates CTα transcription during S phase. Sp1 binds in a phosphorylated state to the CTα promoter. Sp1 binding is enhanced by association with cyclin A/E and CDK2, both in vivo and in vitro. In cells that overexpress Sp1, co-expression of cyclin A and CDK2 induces a high and constant level of CTα expression, whereas reduction in the expression of cyclin A, cyclin E, and CDK2 eliminates the induction of CTα expression in S phase. Furthermore, CTα expression is decreased in cells overexpressing a dominant-negative form of CDK2 and in cells treated with the CDK2 kinase inhibitors roscovitine and olomoucine. These results enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in the expression of CTα in preparation for cell division.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). CDK activities are regulated by a variety of mechanisms, such as a periodic accumulation of cyclins, degradation, nuclear localization, phosphorylation of CDKs, and association with different CDK inhibitors (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4941) Google Scholar, 3Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1643-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cyclin E, in combination with its associated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), is a positive cell cycle regulator controlling progression through G1 and initiation of DNA replication (4Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1071-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 5Hunt T. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 213-222PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sherr C.J.

Cyclin A binds both CDK2 and CDK1 (Cdc2), giving rise to two distinct cyclin A kinase activities, one appearing in S phase (cyclin A-CDK2), and the other in G2 phase (cyclin A-CDK1) (8Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). The cyclin-CDK complexes are thought to control the cell cycle by phosphorylating key regulatory proteins at specific points in the cell cycle.Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that recognizes GC-rich sequences present in many promoters (9Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar, 10Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Regulation of Sp1-dependent transcription can be affected by changes in Sp1 abundance, DNA binding activity, and/or transactivation activity. Phosphorylation, as well as its interaction with other factors, has also been implicated in changes in Sp1 binding and transcriptional activation (11Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A large group of genes is activated in mid- or late G1; these include several genes whose expression is required for DNA synthesis (e.g. those that encode adenosine deaminase, thymidine kinase, dihydrofolate reductase, and DNA polymerase), as well as genes whose products control cell cycle progression (cyclin A and cyclin E genes). Many of these late G1 and S phase-expressed genes lack a TATAA box and have binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 in their promoters.Phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis is an important component of the cell cycle because PC mass/cell doubles prior to mitosis. PC is typically the major phospholipid of animal cells and is a precursor for the synthesis of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine. Cell cycle progression is sensitive to membrane PC content because choline deprivation of WI-38 fibroblasts, L6 myoblasts, or C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts results in decreased PC synthesis and mass with arrest in G1 (13Cornell R. Grove G.L. Rothblat G.H. Horwitz A.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 109: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Terce F. Brun H. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of choline (which is converted to PC) restores PC content and progression into S phase. Chinese hamster ovary cells harboring a temperature-sensitive CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) do not synthesize PC at 40 °C and accumulate in G1. These cells undergo apoptosis unless rescued by the addition of PC or lyso-PC (15Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H. Vance D.E. Terce F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).PC biosynthesis occurs in all nucleated mammalian cells via the Kennedy (CDP-choline) pathway in which CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase catalyzes the regulated and rate-limiting step (16Vance D.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and its expression is tightly regulated. CTα is regulated post-translationally by reversible association with membrane lipids, which are required for its activity (25Tronchere H. Record M. Terce F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Cornell R.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Kent C. Biochim. Biophys.

It was reported that the wave of PC synthesis that accompanies the G0-G1 transition is regulated by changes in the activity, membrane affinity, and intracellular distribution of CT (28Northwood I.C.

At the level of gene expression, CTα mRNA has been shown to increase after growth factor stimulation (29Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16261-16264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), during liver development (30Sesca E. Perletti G.P. Binasco V. Chiara M. Tessitore L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43688-43692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We recently reported that the expression of CTα is activated in late G1-S phase by the action of Sp1 (33Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In the present report we elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying growth/cell cycle-regulated induction of Sp1-dependent transcription of CTα. We demonstrate that complexes that regulate cell cycle progression, such as cyclin E-CDK2 or cyclin A-CDK2, phosphorylate and activate Sp1, thereby increasing CTα transcription during S phase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The luciferase vector pGL3-Basic, which contains the cDNA for Photinus pyralis luciferase, and the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). LipofectAMINE Plus reagent, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Anti-Sp1, anticyclin A, anticyclin E, anticyclin B, anti-CDK2, and anti-CDK1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ECL® immunoblotting reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and olomoucine and roscovitine were from Sigma.Cell Culture—C3H10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were arrested in G0 by incubation in culture medium containing 0.5% serum for 36-48 h, and the growth arrest was released by addition of fresh medium containing 10% FBS. Transient transfections with CTα promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids containing deletions at the 5′-end of the murine promoter, LUC.C7 (-1268/+38) and LUC.C8 (-201/+38) (1 μg), were performed using a cationic liposome method. LUC.C7 (-1268/+38) and LUC.C8 (-201/+38), inserted into the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-Basic (Promega), were prepared as described previously (34Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All dishes received 0.1 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) as a control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase assays were performed using a Promega assays system as recommended by the manufacturer, and luminometric measurements were made using a Fluskan Ascent FL Type 374 fluorometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). Luciferase activity was normalized to the protein content or β-galactosidase activity. Vectors enabling expression of recombinant cyclin A, CDK2, and dominant-negative CDK2 were obtained from Dr. E. Harlow, Harvard Medical School (35van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), and vectors enabling expression of recombinant Sp1 protein (pPacSp1 and pPac0) were obtained from Dr. R. Tjian (36Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar).Nuclear Extract Preparations and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Total nuclear extracts of C3H10T1/2 cells grown to different stages of the cell cycle were prepared as described previously (37Labbe J.C. Capony J.P. Caput D. Cavadore J.C. Derancourt J. Kaghad M. Lelias J.M. Picard A. Doree M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 38Draetta G. Luca F. Westendorf J. Brizuela L. Ruderman J. Beach D. Cell. 1989; 56: 829-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). A dephosphorylation reaction was executed by suspending nuclear extracts (20 μg) in a buffer consisting of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 34 mm KCl, and 50 mm MgCl2 containing protease inhibitors and treated with calf alkaline phosphatase (1.0 unit/50 μg of nuclear extract) at 30 °C for 5 min followed by 15 min on ice. The reactions were terminated by the addition of a mixture of inhibitors to final concentrations of 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm potassium pyrophosphate, and 5 mm sodium phosphate. Control nuclear extracts were prepared by addition of the inhibitor mix to nuclear extracts in the absence of phosphatase treatment or by addition of the inhibitor mix immediately after addition of the enzyme. An oligonucleotide carrying the Sp1 consensus sequence (5′-ATTCGATCGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) was synthesized by the University of Alberta Core Facility. Complementary oligonucleotides (100 μm each) were heated at 90 °C for 5 min and then were slowly cooled to room temperature, and 5 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled using T4 kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For each binding reaction (40 μl), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 20 μl of 2× binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol), 1 μg of nuclear extract, and labeled probe (20,000 cpm) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature.For supershift analysis, 1 μg of antibody specific for cyclin A, cyclin E, or CDK2 was added for 15 min after incubation of the probe with nuclear protein. Binding reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 μl of gel loading buffer (30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The complex was separated on a non-denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel.Immunoblot Analysis—Nuclear protein (10 μg) from C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts was heated for 3 min at 90 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, and 0.004% bromphenol blue. The samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS buffer. The proteins then were transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol). Following transfer, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with 5% skim milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (T-TBS) and incubated for 1 h with antibody raised against the protein indicated. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Construction of Plasmids That Contain DNA Templates for the Synthesis of siRNAs under the Control of the U6 Promoter—DNA oligonucleotide templates for the in vitro synthesis of siRNAs were chemically synthesized by the University of Alberta Core Facility. The oligonucleotides were designed to contain nucleotides specific for cyclin A (TGTAATATCTATTTGGGTC), cyclin E (ATTGCCAAGATTGACAAGA), and CDK2 (GAGTGAACAATTATATTTA). After annealing, the DNA was cloned into pSilencer™ 2.1-U6 hygro (Ambion) double digested with HindIII and EcoRI. The identity of the plasmids harboring the insert, named siCyE, siCyA, and siCDK2, respectively, was confirmed by sequencing, and the plasmids were transfected using the concentrations indicated. As a negative control we used the same plasmid harboring a sequence that does not have homology with the expressed genes (ACTACCGTTGTTATAGGTGTT).Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above from cells collected after 20 h of cell cycle induction. Nuclear extracts (200 μg of protein) were incubated with 5 μg of polyclonal anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1-ml final volume containing immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated for 30 min with 50 μl 10% protein A-Sepharose (Staphilococcus aureus, Cowan strain), and the complex was washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled, and the supernatant was loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with appropriate antibodies.In Vivo Labeling and Immunoblot Analysis—For 32PO4 labeling, cells that had been synchronized by serum deprivation for 36 h were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (135 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.4)) and placed in phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After 30 min, cells were labeled for 2 h in the same medium containing 7.5 μCi/ml 32PO4. At the indicated times following serum stimulation, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed directly in boiling 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 1% SDS, reboiled, and DNA was sheared (9Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). Following the addition of 2.2 volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 7.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm sodium fluoride, 230 mm NaCl, 1.5% Triton X-100, 0.75% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 400 μm Na2VO3, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, particulate material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 min). Supernatants were precleared with normal rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose, and Sp1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp1 antibody and protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) Ipegal CA-630, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS), separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and subjected to autoradiography. Membranes then were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Sp1 antibody and antirabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase as secondary antibody as prescribed by the manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).In Vitro Kinase Assays—Nuclear extracts (200 μg) obtained during S phase were incubated with Sp1 antibody. After addition of protein A-Sepharose, the precipitate was washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, resuspended in 35 μl of kinase buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2) with 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10 ml of 6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For phosphorylation of His-tagged protein, equal amounts of protein (assayed by immunoblot analysis) were used in the assay.Treatment with Roscovitine and Olomoucine—C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were stably transfected with LUC.C8 (-201/+38) and grown under normal conditions for 24 h, after which they were synchronized in G0 phase with DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h. The cell cycle was induced by adding DMEM containing 10% FBS, and 2 h before collecting the samples, roscovitine, olomoucine, or dimethyl sulfoxide was added at the concentrations indicated. Samples were collected 20 h after induction of the cell cycle, and luciferase activity was measured.RESULTSSp1 Interacts with Cyclin A, Cyclin E, and CDK2—The expression of CTα during the S phase of the cell cycle in C3H10T1/2 embryo fibroblasts is mainly regulated by the binding of Sp1 at positions -67/-62 and -31/-39 in the CTα promoter (33Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that overexpression of Sp1 increases expression of CTα in all phases of the cell cycle (33Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the increase in CTα expression during the S phase was maintained, suggesting that overexpression of Sp1 did not explain the increase in CTα expression during the S phase. In the same study we demonstrated that Sp1 interacts with cyclin A, cyclin E, and CDK2 during the S phase.To evaluate the expression pattern of Sp1 and Sp1 binding partners during the cell cycle, we performed immunoblot analyses. C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were synchronized at G0 phase by serum depletion. After serum addition, nuclear extracts were isolated at various time points. We monitored the expression of Sp1, cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2, and cyclin B, which together with CDK1 has been reported to regulate mitosis (39Pines J. Hunter T. Nature. 1990; 346: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 40Minshull J. Golsteyn R. Hill C.S. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 41Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). The result shown in Fig. 1 is consistent with the expression patterns of cyclins and kinases during the cell cycle defined previously (42Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 126-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we detected a retardation in mobility for the Sp1 signal in the S phase that may represent posttranslational modification. We also confirmed that all proteins defined previously as part of the Sp1 complex (cyclin A, cyclin E, and CDK2) are expressed coincidentally. CDK1 was not detected in the phases analyzed, and cyclin B was present at lower levels at the time point that corresponds to the G1-S phase.Time Course for Serum Induction of Sp1 and Phosphorylation—Serum induction of Sp1-dependent transcription from the CTα promoter occurred in S phase (33Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, Sp1 levels and phosphorylation were assessed in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts at various times following serum stimulation. As seen in Fig. 2A, 32PO4 incorporation into Sp1 increases with time, becoming apparent at 16 h and increasing to the maximum at 19 h after serum stimulation. Because S phase occurs 18-20 h following serum stimulation of these cells (data not shown and Refs. 32Golfman L.S. Bakovic M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43688-43692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 33Banchio C. Schang L.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32457-32464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), Sp1 phosphorylation is induced in late G1-S phase and therefore occurs concurrent with, or slightly before, the induction of Sp1-dependent CTα transcription. The level of Sp1 expression analyzed by immunoblot analysis showed that Sp1 is present in all phases of the cell cycle analyzed (Figs. 1 and 2). From this experiment, the shift in Sp1 mobility during the S phase (shown in Fig. 1) is likely because of phosphorylation, suggesting that this mechanism might regulate Sp1 activity in this phase of the cell cycle.Fig. 2Cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Sp1. Equal numbers of C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were serum-starved for 48 h prior to readdition of 10% serum. Cells were then labeled with 32PO4 for 2 h prior to harvest at the indicated times. Sp1 was immunoprecipitated from the cells, and then proteins were electrophoresed by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Incorporation of 32P into Sp1 was detected by autoradiography (A). The position of phosphorylated Sp1 is indicated by the arrowhead. Sp1 levels were compared by immunoblot analysis (B). The blots represent two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Overexpression of Cyclin A and CDK2 Enhances CTα Expression—To determine whether or not phosphorylation affects Sp1 activity and the subsequent activation of CTα expression during the S phase, we determined whether the overexpression of cyclin A and CDK2 affected CTα expression. To address this question, we used luciferase reporter assays. Cells were transfected with the reporter construct LUC.C7 (-1268/+38), Sp1 expression vector pPacSp1, pSV-β-galactosidase, and CMV-cyclin A, CMV-CDK2, or the empty plasmid as a control. After synchronization, the cell cycle was induced, and samples were collected at various times. The luciferase/β-galactosidase ratios are summarized in Fig. 3. Enhanced expression of cyclin A or CDK2 with Sp1 increased the transcriptional activity of the CTα promoter by ∼1.5-2-fold at early points (0 and 13 h) in the cell cycle compared with cells co-transfected with empty plasmids. In cells transfected with either cyclin A or CDK2, the expression profile showed an increase in all phases of the cell cycle prior to S phase (18 and 21 h), indicating that S phase transactivation is dependent on both proteins.Fig. 3Overexpression of cyclin A and CDK2 alters CTα promoter-luciferase expression during the cell cycle. Truncated CTα reporter constructs and pSV-β-galactosidase as a control (1 μg) were transfected into C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts with the constructs LUC.C7 (-1268/+38) (1 μg) + pPacSp1 (1 μg) and CMV (empty plasmid) (1 μg), CMV-cyclin A (1 μg), or CMV-CDK2 (1 μg). Reporter activity is relative to β-galactosidase activity and was measured at the indicated times after induction of the cell cycle. The data represent two independent experiments, and each point was measured in triplicate. These six numbers were used to calculate the error bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CDK2 Phosphorylates and Physically Associates with Sp1—It has been proposed that association between kinases and their substrate proteins can be an important factor in their specificity and activity (43Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated by in vitro assays whether or not the increase in Sp1 phosphorylation was due to its association with CDK2. Nuclear extracts obtained 20 h after induction (S phase) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sp1 antibody. The precipitate was then incubated with histone H1 as a substrate for CDK2 and [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min. The proteins were subsequently electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE. As Fig. 4A shows, several phosphorylated proteins were detected. From the apparent molecular weights, one of the phosphorylated proteins was assumed to be histone H1 (Fig. 4A). By immunoblot analysis we detected Sp1 (Fig. 4B). However, other phosphorylated proteins that we did not identify also co-precipitated with Sp1. When the reaction was performed in the presence of roscovitine (10 μm) (Fig. 4A), the labeling of Sp1 and histone H1 was greatly attenuated, indicating that the kinase activity was inhibited. Roscovitine competes specifically for the ATP-binding domains of CDK1, CDK2, CDK5, CDK7, and possibly CDK9 (44Meijer L. Borgne A."
https://openalex.org/W2166564135,"Insig-1 and Insig-2 are membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum that regulate lipid metabolism by the following two actions: 1) sterol-induced binding to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, an action that leads to ubiquitination and degradation of the enzyme; and 2) sterol-induced binding to SREBP cleavage-activating protein, an action that blocks the proteolytic processing of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), membrane-bound transcription factors that enhance the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. Here we report the isolation of a new mutant line of Chinese hamster ovary cells, designated SRD-14, in which Insig-1 mRNA and protein are not produced due to a partial deletion of the INSIG-1 gene. The SRD-14 cells were produced by γ-irradiation, followed by selection with the 1,1-bisphosphonate ester SR-12813, which mimics sterols in accelerating reductase degradation but does not block SREBP processing. SRD-14 cells fail to respond to sterols by promoting reductase ubiquitination and degradation. The rate at which sterols suppress SREBP processing is significantly slower in SRD-14 cells than wild type CHO-7 cells. Sterol regulation of reductase degradation and SREBP processing is restored when SRD-14 cells are transfected with expression plasmids encoding either Insig-1 or Insig-2. These results provide formal genetic proof for the essential role of Insig-1 in feedback control of lipid synthesis in cultured cells.

Insigs coordinate lipid synthesis via their sterol-dependent binding to two polytopic ER membrane proteins: sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase). Sterol-dependent binding of Insigs to SCAP leads to the ER retention of SCAP·SREBP complexes, thus preventing their translocation to the Golgi where the SREBPs are activated by sequential proteolytic cleavages (1Yang T.

Sterol-induced binding of Insigs to reductase leads to its ubiquitination and consequent degradation by proteasomes, thus slowing the rate-limiting reaction in cholesterol synthesis (3Sever N.

The two human Insig proteins are 59% identical and are predicted to contain six membrane-spanning helices (5Feramisco J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8487-8496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Insig-1 and Insig-2 appear to have overlapping functions in mediating sterol regulation of SCAP and reductase, but the proteins differ in their mode of regulation (2Yabe D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 6Yabe D. Komuro R. Liang G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3155-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, the INSIG-1 gene is a target of SREBPs, and its mRNA rises and falls according to the nuclear content of processed SREBPs. The INSIG-2 gene is controlled by two promoters that give rise to alternative transcripts, designated Insig-2a and Insig-2b, with different noncoding first exons spliced into a common second exon. The Insig-2b transcript is ubiquitous and, in cultured cells, is unvarying; it is not influenced by SREBPs. The Insig-2a transcript is expressed exclusively in the liver and is negatively regulated by insulin. SREBPs are a family of membrane-bound transcription factors that enhance transcription of genes encoding cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes and the LDL receptor (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized SREBPs localize to membranes of the ER and nuclear envelope with a significant fraction of them found in tight association with SCAP. In sterol-depleted cells, SCAP escorts SREBPs to the Golgi where the SREBPs are proteolytically released from membranes, thereby allowing transcriptionally active fragments to enter the nucleus and modulate target gene transcription. Sterols inhibit SREBP activation by preventing the exit of SREBP-SCAP complexes from the ER, leading to decreased synthesis of cholesterol and other lipids (8Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The block in SREBP export is achieved through sterol-induced binding of SCAP to Insigs (1Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

The Insig-binding site in SCAP is located within its membrane domain, which comprises eight membrane-spanning segments (10Nohturfft A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A segment corresponding to helices 2-6 of the SCAP membrane domain demonstrates significant sequence similarities to the corresponding region in reductase, whose membrane domain also contains eight membrane-spanning segments (11Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and this region has become known as the sterol-sensing domain (12Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

HMG-CoA reductase produces mevalonate, an important intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids (17Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar). Sterol and nonsterol end products of mevalonate metabolism accelerate degradation of reductase as part of a complex, multivalent feedback mechanism that contributes to sterol homeostasis (18Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid. Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When reductase is overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by transfection, the enzyme is no longer rapidly degraded in response to sterol treatment (3Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Insig-1 restores regulated degradation of overexpressed reductase, and this degradation can be inhibited by overexpressing the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP, suggesting the two proteins compete for limiting amounts of Insigs when sterol levels are high. The combined knockdown of Insig-1 and Insig-2 through RNA interference (RNAi) abolishes sterol-regulated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of endogenous reductase in human fibroblasts (4Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBoseBoyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination and degradation of reductase require its sterol-dependent binding to Insigs, as indicated by the observation that point mutations within the reductase sterol-sensing domain prevent its association with Insigs, rendering the enzyme resistant to sterol-stimulated ubiquitination and degradation. Although the sterol effects on reductase and SCAP require binding to Insigs, the consequences appear remarkably different. After binding to Insigs, reductase is degraded by a process mediated by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, whereas binding of SCAP to Insigs leads to its ER retention. To understand how binding to Insigs can have such different effects on its two ligands requires the development of procedures through which other members of the SCAP-Insig and reductase-Insig complexes can be identified. Hmg2p, one of two reductase isozymes expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, undergoes regulated degradation that displays similarities to the analogous process in mammalian cells (19Hampton R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 345-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The molecular participants in regulated degradation of Hmg2p have been revealed through genetic analyses of HRD (HMG-CoA Reductase Degradation) mutants (20Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). HRD genes encode proteins that play distinct roles in the Hmg2p degradative pathway (21Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For example, the HRD1 and HRD3 genes encode proteins that constitute a membrane-bound ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates Hmg2p ubiquitination in response to degradative signals (22Gardner R.G. Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The HRD2 gene encodes a subunit of the 26 S proteasome, supporting a role for proteasomes in regulated Hmg2p degradation, whereas HRD4 mutants are defective in post-ubiquitination steps prior to proteasomal destruction of the enzyme (23Bays N.W. Wilhovsky S.K. Goradia A. Hodgkiss-Harlow K. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4114-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 24Bays N.W. Hampton R.Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R366-R371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Considering this and the successful application of somatic cell genetics in unraveling the SREBP pathway (25Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Brown M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), a genetic analysis of mammalian reductase degradation should expedite the identification of molecules recruited to the sterol-dependent reductase-Insig complex. However, in order to use genetic complementation and expression cloning techniques like those used for the identification of SCAP and the proteases that release SREBPs from membranes, mutant cells defective in sterol-accelerated reductase degradation are required. In the past, mutagenized CHO cells were cultured in the continual presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis because of its ability to accelerate degradation of reductase and block proteolytic activation of SREBPs (8Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The oxysterol is toxic to wild type cells because it cannot substitute for cholesterol as a structural membrane component, and cells die unless a usable source of cholesterol is supplied exogenously. Mutant cells survive chronic 25-hydroxycholesterol treatment because they do not turn off cholesterol synthesis in the presence of oxysterols, forming the genetic basis for their isolation. However, the sterol-resistant mutants isolated to date either harbor point mutations in the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP or produce abnormal truncated versions of SREBP-2 that enter the nucleus without requiring proteolysis (9Yabe D.

Thus, to facilitate the isolation of mutant cells incapable of accelerating reductase degradation, selection of mutagenized cells must be carried out with a reagent that replaces sterols to promote reductase degradation but not ER retention of SCAP. The hypocholesterolemic activity of 1,1-bisphosphonate esters such as SR-12813, and its structurally related analog, Apomine, has been well documented (30Ylitalo R. Gen. Pharmacol. 2000; 35: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Berkhout T.A. Simon H.M. Jackson B. Yates J. Pearce N. Groot P.H. Bentzen C. Niesor E. Kerns W.D. Suckling K.E.

In cultured cells, these drugs decrease reductase activity by accelerating degradation of the enzyme which triggers an increase in the expression of LDL receptors, thus explaining the hypocholesterolemic activity of the drugs when administered orally to animals. The effects of SR-12813 on reductase appear similar to those of oxysterols; however, unlike oxysterols, SR-12813 treatment does not reduce but rather enhances mRNAs for reductase and the LDL receptor. In the current studies, we evaluated the utility of SR-12813 as a selecting agent in mutagenesis experiments aimed toward isolating mutant cells incapable of accelerating reductase degradation. The resultant cell line, designated SRD-14, was found to harbor a partial deletion of the INSIG-1 gene. SRD-14 cells cannot accelerate reductase degradation in response to sterols or SR-12813, and the rate of sterol-mediated suppression of SREBP processing in the cells is dramatically reduced. The experiments with the SRD-14 cells provide formal genetic proof of the essential role Insigs play in not only reductase degradation but also the ER retention of SCAP·SREBP.

Mutagenesis and Isolation of SR-12813-resistant Cells Deficient in Insig-1—On day 0, 2.5 × 107 CHO-7 cells were subjected to γ-irradiation as described previously (44Rawson R.B. Cheng D. Brown M.S.

The cells were immediately plated at 5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish in medium B supplemented with 5% LPDS. On day 1, the medium was replaced with medium B containing 5% LPDS and 10 μm SR-12813. Fresh medium was added to the cells every 2 days until colonies formed. On day 29, the surviving colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders and allowed to proliferate. Of the 50 original dishes, 14 contained SR-12813-resistant colonies, and it was determined that 8 of the colonies lacked expression of Insig-1 mRNA. The most vigorous colony was cloned by limiting dilution and designated SRD-14 cells. SRD-14/pInsig-1 and SRD-14/pInsig-2 cells, derivatives of SRD-14 cells stably expressing Insig-1-Myc or Insig-2-Myc, respectively, were generated as follows. On day 0, SRD-14 cells were set up at 5 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish in medium B supplemented with 5% LPDS. On day 1, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCMV-Insig-1-Myc or pCMVInsig-2-Myc using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described above. On day 2, cells were switched to medium B supplemented with 5% LPDS and 700 μg/ml G418. Fresh medium was added every 2-3 days until colonies formed after about 2 weeks. Individual colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders, and Insig-1 or Insig-2 expression was assessed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc. Cells from a single colony were cloned by limiting dilution and maintained in medium B containing 5% LPDS and 500 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C, 8-9% CO2.

For this process, the NarJ chaperone is strictly required (Blasco, F., Dos Santos, J. P., Magalon, A., Frixon, C., Guigliarelli, B., Santini, C. L., and Giordano, G. (1998) Mol. Microbiol. 28, 435–447). We report the first description of protein interactions between molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic proteins (MogA, MoeA, MobA, and MobB) and the aponitrate reductase (NarG) using a bacterial two-hybrid approach. Two conditions have to be satisfied to allow the visualization of the interactions, (i) the presence of an active and mature molybdenum cofactor and (ii) the presence of the NarJ chaperone and of the NarG structural partner subunit, NarH. Formation of tungsten-substituted cofactor prevents the interaction between NarG and the four biosynthetic proteins. Our results suggested that the final stages of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis occur on a complex made up by MogA, MoeA, MobA, and MobB, which is also in charge with the delivery of the mature cofactor onto the aponitrate reductase A in a NarJ-assisted process.

Molybdenum plays a critical role in the biogeochemistry of nitrogen and sulfur and, as such, has been found to be essential in most mammals as well as in plants. It constitutes an essential trace element found associated with a large group of redox active enzymes in eukaryotes, eubacteria and Archaea. With the exception of nitrogenase, molybdenum is present as an ubiquitous basic structure composed of a molybdenum atom coordinated to one or two molecules of a tricyclic pyranopterin forming the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) 1The abbreviations used are: Moco, molybdenum cofactor; MPT, molybdopterin; MGD, molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide.1The abbreviations used are: Moco, molybdenum cofactor; MPT, molybdopterin; MGD, molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide. (1Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all organisms studied so far, Moco is synthesized by an ancient, ubiquitous, and highly conserved biosynthetic pathway. Moco biosynthesis has been extensively studied in Escherichia coli by using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and structural approaches. Moco biosynthesis can be divided into three steps, (i) the conversion of a guanine nucleotide to form precursor Z, (ii) the introduction of two sulfur atoms to give molybdopterin (MPT), and (iii) the chelation of molybdenum by MPT thus forming active Moco (2Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Met. Ions. Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 317-368PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In prokaryotes, the cofactor can be further modified by the attachment of a nucleotide onto the terminal phosphate group of MPT (1Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, most of the molybdoenzymes require not only the GMP-modified form of MPT, i.e. MGD (molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide) for their activity but a Mo-(bis-MPT)-based cofactor where one Mo atom is coordinated by four dithiolenes of two MGD molecules (3Boyington J.C.

However, although the synthesis of Mo-MGD is well documented, formation of Mo-(bis-MGD) remains enigmatic. Noteworthy is that the two processes of molybdenum insertion catalyzed by MogA and MoeA proteins (8Hasona A. Ray R.M. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Joshi M.S. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of dinucleotide formation catalyzed by MobA (10Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) seem to be strongly linked (11Nichols J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Information about Moco incorporation within apomolybdoenzymes is scarce. So far, nothing is known about the Moco donor or the molecular mechanism of Moco transfer. In prokaryotes, several molybdoenzymes incorporate the cofactor by a process that involves enzyme-specific chaperones. This situation was first noted for maturation of the dissimilatory nitrate reductase A of E. coli where NarJ was shown to be needed (12Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The list of such chaperones has been expanded by TorD required for the maturation of the trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (14Pommier J. Mejean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Ilbert M. Mejean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The exact function of this new class of proteins is not yet well understood despite an active role in Moco incorporation facilitation (13Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Ilbert M. Mejean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Another participant in such a process is the Moco carrier defined as a molecule linking Moco biosynthesis to its subsequent incorporation into various apomolybdoenzymes (17Amy N.K. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 114-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known concerning the identity of this carrier molecule. Interestingly, mutations affecting the activity of E. coli molybdoenzymes mapped only in loci involved in Mo transport (mod) or Moco biosynthesis (moa, mob, moe, and mog) (18Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such an observation indicates that Mo proteins could ensure Moco protection until its delivery to the apoenzymes. Recent work (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) has shown that, in vivo, numerous protein-protein interactions exist among mo gene products involved in the final stages of Moco biosynthesis and that some of them even require the binding of Moco intermediates to occur. One can envision that these steps occur on a multiprotein complex allowing a fast and protected transfer of oxygen-sensitive intermediates and subsequent delivery of active Moco to resident apomolybdoenzymes. In this work, we provided the first molecular evidence for the presence of interactions between the Moco biosynthetic machinery and an apomolybdoenzyme, the E. coli aponitrate reductase A, being used as a model. Interestingly, two conditions have to be satisfied to permit any of the interactions to occur, the presence of a mature and active Moco and the presence of the NarJ chaperone. Taken together, our data point to an unexpected essential role for the enzyme-specific chaperones exemplified by NarJ in mediating the interaction between the Moco carrier and the apoenzyme. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Media—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are described in Table I. Using BTH101 as recipient strain (20Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D.

As needed, sodium molybdate or sodium tungstate were added at 1 and 10 mm final concentration, respectively. When required, 50 μg·ml–1 ampicillin, 50 μg·ml–1 chloramphenicol, 50 μg·ml–1 kanamycin, and 25 μg·ml–1 tetracycline were employed.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyDescriptionReference or sourceStrain or plasmidDH5αsupE44, ΔlacU169 (ϕ80 lacZΔM15), hsdR17, recA, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, relA1Laboratory collectionBTH101F′, cya-99, araD139, galE15, galK16, rpsL1(StrR), hsdR2, mcrA1, mcrB124Karimova G.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid Constructions for Two-hybrid Assays—For the generation of pT25NarGH and pT25NarGHJ plasmids, narGH and narGHJ genes were individually amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA of strain MC4100 as template. narGH genes were KpnI-restricted and ligated into the KpnI site of the pT25 plasmid. narGHJ genes were amplified to generate a PCR product flanked by SmaI and KpnI sites. This fragment was digested and subcloned into the polylinker of the pT25 vector. For the generation of the pT25NarGJ plasmid, narG and narJ genes were separately amplified with overlapping primers allowing further amplification of a narGJ fragment. The PCR product was KpnI-restricted and ligated into the pT25 plasmid. In these three different plasmids, narH, narJ, or narHJ genes are expressed together with the T25narG gene fusion under the control of the same promoter (24Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D.

Protein interactions were estimated by β-galactosidase activity measurements in cells at mid-log phase grown at 30 °C in L-broth medium supplemented with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (19Magalon A.

The β-galactosidase activity values (expressed in Miller units) are the average of at least three independent experiments and vary by no more than 10% from the mean. Interaction between Several Mo Proteins and NarG Requires Active Moco—To evaluate whether the observed in vivo interaction network among Mo proteins involved in the final stages of Moco biosynthesis (19Magalon A.

In an initial test, interactions between NarG, the Moco-containing subunit, and each of the four Mo proteins tested (MogA, MoeA, MobA, and MobB) were assayed in a wild-type strain BTH101. Interestingly, each of the four proteins interacted to varying extents with NarG, MoeA, and MobB displaying the highest levels of interaction (Fig. 2).

Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it has been tested whether the presence of Moco is also needed for interaction with NarG. At first, the effect of Moco absence on the interactions has been probed in a BTH101moa strain (Figs. 1 and 2). All of the interactions have been lost supporting the idea that NarG does not interact individually with each of the Mo proteins but rather with a Mo protein complex absent in such conditions. Indeed, one would have expected the maintenance of some of the interactions in the case that each of the tested Mo proteins interacts individually and separately with the apoenzyme. To verify such a hypothesis, the effect of several mutations interrupting Moco biosynthesis at different stages and having differential consequences on the interaction network among the four Mo proteins (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) has been studied. The interactions between NarG and each of the four Mo proteins have been assayed in a BTH101mob strain synthesizing an active Moco (Mo-MPT) for MPT-dependent enzymes (Fig. 1). Here again, none of the Mo proteins interacted with NarG (Fig. 2). Such an observation might be the consequence of either the absence of Mo-(bis-MGD), the active Moco for MGD-containing enzymes such as nitrate reductase A, and/or the loss of integrity of a Mo protein complex because of the absence of both MobA and MobB. Although in such a strain, the presence of either T18- or T25-MobA fusion proteins and not of MobB equivalents leads to a full restoration of the mutant phenotype (12Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and as a consequence cannot be tested, the interaction between MobB and NarG has been assayed (Fig. 2). Interestingly, no interaction has been detected limiting the phenomenon to the absence of MobA as a crucial component of a Mo protein complex, the only complex able to interact with NarG and one which would not form in a mob mutant. As a control, interactions have been assayed in a mobB context. Interestingly, MogA, MoeA, and MobA interacted with NarG as in the wild-type strain but at a lower level (data not shown). As expected from the absence of the phenotype in a mobB strain (12Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the minimal set of Mo proteins required for the interaction with NarG is MogA, MoeA, and MobA. As previously reported, MPT produced in a mod mutant affected on the high affinity molybdate uptake system (25Pau R.N. Lawson D.M. Met. Ions. Biol. Syst. 2002; 39: 31-74PubMed Google Scholar) is sufficient to trigger or facilitate Moco-dependent interactions among the Mo proteins (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, such a strain, which synthesizes a Moco intermediate (Fig. 1) and maintains the integrity of the Mo proteins interacting network, has been employed to probe the interactions between NarG and each of the Mo proteins. Interestingly, all of the interactions are lost (Fig. 2) indicating that the presence of a mature Moco is a prerequisite for interactions between the Mo proteins and NarG. Synthesis of a Tungsten-substituted Cofactor Prevents Interactions between NarG and the Mo Proteins—Tungsten is a close analog of molybdenum and has been shown to be incorporated into the Moco biosynthetic pathway via a still unknown mechanism. In E. coli, the addition of tungstate to the growth medium of a mod mutant leads to the synthesis of inactive molybdoenzymes (17Amy N.K. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 114-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rothery R.A. Magalon A. Giordano G. Guigliarelli B. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7462-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the exception of the trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (27Buc J. Santini C.L. Giordani R. Czjzek M. Wu L.F. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this latter case, only a small fraction of the enzyme (<10%) has incorporated the W-(bis-MGD) cofactor (27Buc J. Santini C.L. Giordani R. Czjzek M. Wu L.F. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, tungsten prevents both molybdenum ligation by MPT and insertion of the organic component of the cofactor into the nitrate reductase A as recently confirmed by the x-ray structure of the apoenzyme (26Rothery R.A. Magalon A. Giordano G. Guigliarelli B. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7462-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Cammack R. Palak M. Blasco F. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5324-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To better understand the reason of the absence of W-(bis-MGD) cofactor within the E. coli nitrate reductase A, interactions have been assayed in a mod mutant supplemented by 10 mm tungstate (W) (Fig. 2). It is important to notice that the pairwise interaction network among Mo proteins is maintained under these conditions as reported previously (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although NarG still interacts with NarJ (900 Miller units), it does not interact any longer with each of the Mo proteins thus explaining the non-incorporation of W-(bis-MGD). Taken together, all of these results strongly suggest that interactions between NarG and the Mo proteins require mature and active Moco i.e. Mo-(bis-MGD) cofactor. Interactions between Mo Proteins and NarG further Require NarJ and NarH—Because Moco incorporation within the aponitrate reductase A strictly requires the presence of the enzyme-specific chaperone protein, NarJ (13Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), one can envision that this protein is needed for the interactions between NarG and the Mo proteins. To assess the effect of the NarJ absence, an in-frame deletion of narJ has been performed in a BTH101narZ mutant devoid of the NarJ-homolog, NarW, yielding the BTH101narZ,narJ strain. Interestingly, all of the pairwise interactions have been lost, supporting a critical role for NarJ (data not shown). To verify this point, a plasmidic construct allowing the co-expression of NarJ together with the T25NarG fusion protein has been employed. The additional presence of NarJ restores the interactions between NarG and the Mo proteins pointing to an unexpected key role for NarJ in the Moco incorporation process. To test whether among the nar-encoded proteins (NarG, -H, -J, and -I) (30Blasco F. Iobbi C. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Bonnefoy V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) NarJ is the only protein required to allow NarG to interact with the Mo proteins, a nar-deficient strain (BTH101narA,narZ) has been constructed by P1 transduction. As predicted, all of the interactions have been lost due at least to the NarJ absence (Fig. 3). However, providing NarJ in trans does not allow a restoration of the interactions between NarG and the Mo proteins pointing to a role for NarH, the structural partner subunit absent in such a context. As a control, a similar plasmidic construct allowing co-expression of NarH together with T25NarG have been tested and does not restore the interactions of NarG with the Mo proteins. Finally, co-expression of both NarH and NarJ with T25NarG was required to restore the interactions (Fig. 3). Such a result suggests that proper folding of the NarG catalytic subunit for interaction with each of the Mo proteins can only be achieved by the action of its partner structural subunit, NarH, and of the NarJ chaperone. Microorganisms have the extraordinary ability to rapidly adapt their metabolism to environmental changes by inducing respiratory enzymes and altering their metabolic activity. Under anaerobic growth conditions, E. coli produces several molybdoenzymes almost all of which serve as terminal enzymes in the anaerobic respiratory pathway (31Richardson D.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Production of active molybdoenzymes depends on the coordination of apoprotein synthesis with synthesis and acquisition of the molybdenum cofactor. Once mature and active Moco is synthesized within the prokaryotic cell, various resident apomolybdoenzymes efficiently and rapidly incorporate Moco via a still unknown mechanism, which in some cases involves enzyme-specific chaperones. The present work has several implications for understanding the Moco incorporation process. According to our previous studies (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a transient complex made up by at least MogA, MoeA, and MobA would exist allowing efficient coupling between the two last steps of Moco biosynthesis i.e. molybdenum addition and nucleotide binding to yield active Moco, although the mechanistic details remain unclear. How do the interactions among the Mo proteins involved in the final stages of Moco biosynthesis contribute to its subsequent incorporation into various apomolybdoenzymes? In this report, using a bacterial two-hybrid approach we have demonstrated the physical interaction of an apomolybdoenzyme exemplified by NarG, the Moco-containing subunit of the E. coli nitrate reductase A and four distinct Mo proteins (MogA, MoeA, MobA, and MobB). It is important to note that one would have expected an interaction of NarG with a single Mo protein, i.e. MobA, because of its role in a late event of Moco biosynthesis rather than with several Mo proteins. Interestingly, all of the pairwise interactions with NarG are lost simultaneously in the absence of Moco biosynthesis, a situation encountered in a moa strain. Furthermore, our analyses have clearly shown that no interaction was observed until completion of the Moco biosynthesis, in marked contrast with the interactions existing among the Mo proteins (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Overall, these observations support the contention that NarG interacts with a protein complex formed in the presence of Moco as reported previously (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) rather than with isolated proteins. Such a consideration has important consequences for the understanding of the Moco incorporation mechanism as a direct transfer of mature Moco from the Mo protein complex onto the apomolybdoenzymes. Hence, a Mo protein complex could represent the long time proposed Moco carrier allowing the protection and transfer of active and mature Moco onto resident apomolybdoenzymes as anticipated in our previous work (Fig. 4) (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because of the crucial role of the NarJ chaperone for Moco incorporation within the E. coli aponitrate reductase A (13Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), it has been tempting to check whether or not the absence of NarJ might have an effect on the interactions between each of the Mo proteins and NarG. Unexpectedly, NarJ plays an essential role in allowing interactions between NarG and the Mo protein complex, the latter representing the Moco delivery machinery. Does the chaperone interact with each of the Mo proteins? An answer to this question must await further experiments. To get a better understanding of the NarJ-assisted Moco incorporation process, there has been the question of whether pairwise interactions between NarG and the Mo proteins can also exist in the absence of the structural partner subunit NarH i.e. whether Moco is incorporated within NarG before its association with NarH during the course of the nitrate reductase biogenesis. Our results have clearly demonstrated that the interactions between NarG and each of the Mo proteins can only occur when NarH and NarJ are both provided. Consequently, a mature Moco would only be transferred onto an apo-NarGH complex. On the basis of the crystallographic view of the apo-NarGHI complex (28Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Cammack R. Palak M. Blasco F. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5324-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it is difficult to conceive of how the Mo-(bis-MGD) cofactor can be incorporated within such a closed structure. First, does NarJ have access to such a complex i.e. the membrane-associated one? In fact, recent work has indicated that only the soluble apo-NarGH complex is able to interact with NarJ and as such to incorporate Moco. 2J. Pommier, R. Toci, G. Giordano, and A. Magalon, manuscript in preparation. Hence, crystallization of the apo-NarGH complex capable to undergo the maturation process should be considered. Overall, a hypothetical model describing Moco biosynthesis and incorporation within a prokaryotic molybdoenzyme, the E. coli nitrate reductase A can be delineated from our previous work (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the present results (Fig. 4). The proposed model implies that (i) the interaction between NarG and its dedicated NarJ chaperone is an early event as such interaction is maintained in any mo mutant (data not shown), (ii) the final stages of Moco biosynthesis occur on a protein complex made up of at least MogA, MoeA, and MobA (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) regardless of the apoenzyme, and (iii) the interaction between the Mo protein complex and the aponitrate reductase (apo-NarGH) only occurs after the completion of Moco biosynthesis and in the presence of the NarJ chaperone. Tungsten, a close analog to molybdenum, has been shown to be incorporated as such into the Moco biosynthesis pathway via a still unknown mechanism rendering most of the E. coli molybdoenzymes inactive. For instance, in contrast to the trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (27Buc J. Santini C.L. Giordani R. Czjzek M. Wu L.F. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), nitrate reductase A cannot incorporate a tungsten-substituted cofactor as recently confirmed by the crystallographic structure of the apo-NarGHI complex (28Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Cammack R. Palak M. Blasco F. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5324-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Such an observation raises the question whether the multiple pairwise interactions observed between NarG and each of the four Mo proteins will be maintained in the presence of W-(bis-MGD) cofactor. In fact, none of the interactions was observed giving an explanation to the absence of cofactor within the aponitrate reductase A. One should notice that enhancement of some specific interactions among the Mo proteins has been reported previously under these conditions (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inability of the Mo protein complex to deliver W-(bis-MGD) to apoenzymes such as the nitrate reductase will lead to its accumulation (Fig. 4). Because of the essential role of NarJ for these interactions and not of TorD as shown by the absence of phenotype of a torD mutant (14Pommier J. Mejean V. Giordano G. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16615-16620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that such enzyme-specific chaperones ensure both the control and the specificity of the Moco incorporation process. According to such a hypothesis, false incorporation of W-(bis-MGD) within the E. coli trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase would be the direct consequence of the non-essential character of the TorD chaperone. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrated a network of dynamic protein-protein interactions among and between the Mo proteins and an apoenzyme thus forming most likely a large and multimeric complex. However, biochemical visualization will be hampered by the rapid dissociation of the complex made between the Mo proteins and NarG, as soon as conditions required for its formation are identical to those that will lead to an effective Moco transfer and resolution of the whole complex. Until now attempts to identify the high molecular mass complexes by several techniques have been unsuccessful (data not shown). Such short lived or dynamic complexes may dissociate and reform in response to the metabolic status of the cell, thereby providing a rapid and powerful mechanism for regulating molybdoenzymes synthesis. It is important to note that the ability to overproduce in an active form either Mo-(bis-MGD)- or Mo-MPT-containing enzymes in E. coli has been reported for a long time (32Leimkuhler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem.

Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). According to such observations, the Moco biosynthetic and delivery machinery is readily able to respond to a high demand in mature Moco. In the case of the nitrate reductase A, the cell apparently coordinates Moco biosynthesis with apoprotein synthesis at the level of moe operon transcription (36Hasona A. Self W.T. Shanmugam K.T. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Conversely, the mob operon is transcribed constitutively at very low levels (37Iobbi-Nivol C. Palmer T. Whitty P.W. McNairn E. Boxer D.H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1663-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Transcriptome analysis has also indicated that mog gene is constitutively expressed. 3J. H. Weiner, personal communication. Considering that the minimal set of Mo proteins allowing both the final stages of Moco biosynthesis and incorporation of Mo-(bis-MGD) cofactor within the aponitrate reductase A consists of MogA, MoeA, and MobA, it is interesting to notice that MoeA is the only protein of which expression level varies. As soon as the proteins involved in the final stages of Moco biosynthesis are also in charge of Moco delivery in several apoenzymes, the latter process needs to be extremely rapid to allow recycling of the Mo proteins expressed at very low levels in the cell. The function of the enzyme-specific chaperones would then be, as such, to optimize the Moco incorporation process. In the case of the nitrate reductase A, the NarJ chaperone is strictly required to allow Moco transfer (12Palmer T. Santini C.L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) via the interaction with the Moco biosynthetic machinery (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the presence of the non-essential TorD chaperone enhances Moco incorporation within the E. coli trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (15Ilbert M. Mejean V. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Samama J.P. Iobbi-Nivol C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28787-28792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Many cellular processes rely upon the concerted action of multiple proteins. During such events, specific protein-protein interactions play an essential role. In this report, we provide several indications concerning the fact that Mo proteins work in concert during the last sequential steps of Moco biosynthesis (19Magalon A. Frixon C. Pommier J. Giordano G. Blasco F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48199-48204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and transfer the active Moco to the aponitrate reductase, which as a consequence lead to resolve the whole protein network. Moco intermediate channeling can thus easily be envisioned as a means to (i) attain high levels of Moco biosynthesis, (ii) coordinate the activities of MogA, MoeA, and MobA, (iii) sequester reactive intermediates, and (iv) regulate competition between branch pathways for common metabolites such as MPT. A second major insight of our analysis was that the NarJ chaperone is needed to allow the Mo proteins to interact with NarG. We thank J. H. Weiner from the Project Cybercell (Institute for Biomolecular Design, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada) for providing transcriptome data."

NPR1 is a protein kinase that controls post-Golgi sorting of amino acid permeases. In the presence of a good nitrogen source, TOR (target of rapamycin) maintains GLN3 and NPR1 phosphorylated and inactive by inhibiting the type 2A-related phosphatase SIT4. We identified NPR1 as a regulator of GLN3. Specifically, loss of NPR1 causes nuclear translocation and activation of GLN3, but not GAT1, in nitrogen-rich conditions. NPR1-mediated inhibition of GLN3 is independent of the phosphatase SIT4. We also demonstrate that the E3/E4 ubiquitin-protein ligase proteins RSP5 and BUL1/2 are required for GLN3 activation under poor nitrogen conditions. Thus, NPR1 and BUL1/2 antagonistically control GLN3-dependent transcription, suggesting a role for regulated ubiquitination in the control of nutrient-responsive transcription.

In yeast, the quality of the available nitrogen source controls the expression of genes encoding proteins required for the uptake and assimilation of nitrogenous compounds. This regulatory process is mediated by four GATA transcription factors, the activators GLN3 and GAT1/NIL1 and the repressors DAL80 and DEH1/NIL2/GZF3. GLN3 is the major activator of nitrogen-regulated genes (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Cooper T.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 223-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Magasanik B. Kaiser C. Gene. 2002; 290: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). URE2 is a GLN3-binding protein that retains GLN3 in the cytoplasm to prevent its nuclear translocation and activation during growth under good nitrogen conditions. The two homologous kinases TOR1 1The abbreviations used are: TOR, target of rapamycin; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; E4, ubiquitin-chain assembly factor; HA, hemagglutinin A. and TOR2 are central controllers of cell growth, and their inactivation with rapamycin causes physiological changes characteristic of nutrientstarved cells (3Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 4Schmelzle T. Hall M.N.

A TOR signaling pathway regulates the expression of nitrogen-regulated genes by inhibiting GLN3 and GAT1 (5Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In the presence of a preferred nitrogen source such as NH +4 or glutamine, TOR promotes complex formation between GLN3 and URE2 by maintaining GLN3 in the phosphorylated state necessary for URE2 binding (5Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Upon nitrogen limitation or rapamycin treatment, the TOR-controlled phosphatase SIT4 causes GLN3 dephosphorylation, and GLN3 dissociates from URE2 and translocates into the nucleus to activate target genes (5Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). NPR1 encodes a Ser/Thr kinase that controls the post-Golgi sorting and degradation of amino acid permeases. NPR1 inversely regulates GAP1, the general amino acid permease, and TAT2, a tryptophan permease (2Magasanik B. Kaiser C. Gene. 2002; 290: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In cells grown in poor nitrogen sources, NPR1 is dephosphorylated by the TOR-modulated SIT4 phosphatase to become active (6Schmidt A. Beck T. Koller A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In turn, active NPR1 allows GAP1 to reach the plasma membrane and causes the rapid degradation of TAT2. In cells shifted to a good nitrogen source medium, plasma membrane GAP1 is internalized and pre-existing permease is no longer delivered to the plasma membrane, whereas TAT2 is stabilized at the plasma membrane (7Roberg K.J. Rowley N. Kaiser C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1469-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol.

GAP1 down-regulation occurs via its ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase RSP5 in conjunction with the RSP5-binding proteins BUL1 and BUL2 (8Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol.

Here, we identify NPR1 as a negative regulator of GLN3-dependent transcription. Deletion of NPR1 causes nuclear localization and activation of GLN3 during growth on a good nitrogen source. Activation of GLN3 in npr1 mutant cells requires the presence of functional RSP5 and BUL1/2 proteins, and BUL1/2 proteins are necessary for the activation of GLN3 under nitrogen starvation conditions. Thus, a ubiquitin-dependent signaling pathway appears to control GLN3-dependent transcription.

Beck T. Koller A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) containing HA-NPR1 into YCplac33. pJC21 expressing kinase-dead single HA-tagged NPR1 was constructed by replacing the 2.6-kb fragment from pJC20 by a 2.6-kb fragment from pAS104 containing HA-NPR1 with the mutation K467R. YCpMEP2-lacZ was described previously (12Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar).

Colonies that formed after 4 days incubation at 30 °C were tested for growth on plates of SD medium without His containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.

For microarray analysis, RNA was reverse transcribed, and cDNA was prepared using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was used as template for the production of biotin-labeled cRNA using a RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo). Finally, the labeled cRNA was purified using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen), fragmented by incubation with potassium/magnesium acetate and hybridized to Affymetrix S98 Yeast GeneChips, as recommended by the manufacturer. Raw expression signals for each transcript were computed using the algorithm implemented in MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix). The robust multichip average method, implemented as a part of the BioConductor (bioconductor.org) package affy, was employed for data normalization, background correction, and summarization (25Irizarry R.A.

Indirect Immunofluorescence—GLN3-Myc and GAT1-HA were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence on whole fixed cells as described (26Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (×100 objective). Western Blot—GLN3-Myc was detected by Western blot as described previously (5Beck T. Hall M.N.

Determination of Intracellular Amino Acid Pools—The intracellular levels of amino acids were determined as described (26Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Identification of the NPR1 as a Negative Regulator of Nitrogen-controlled Genes—To find new regulators of GATA transcription factors, we performed a transposon insertion screen to identify mutations in genes whose products are required to repress GLN3 and/or GAT1 under rich nitrogen conditions. A strain expressing the HIS3 gene from the GLN3-/GAT1-dependent promoter of the NH +4 permease MEP2 (PMEP2-HIS3) (12Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) cannot survive in NH +4 medium lacking histidine because GLN3 and GAT1 are inactive, whereas e.g. his3 ure2 cells can grow under the same conditions because of the constitutive activation of at least GLN3 (Fig. 1A). We identified a mutation in NPR1 that allows growth of his3 PMEP2-HIS3 cells on NH +4 medium lacking histidine (Fig. 1A), suggesting that NPR1 is normally required to repress GLN3 and/or GAT1 during growth in a good nitrogen source. To confirm that npr1 causes expression of MEP2, we assessed the expression of a second reporter, PMEP2-lacZ, in wild type, npr1, and ure2 cells. Expression from PMEP2-lacZ was ∼12 times higher in npr1 cells and ∼25 times higher in ure2 cells compared with that from the wild-type strain (Fig. 1B). NPR1 is a protein kinase, and we transformed npr1 cells with plasmids carrying NPR1 (pJC20) or npr1kin– that encodes kinase-dead NPR1 (pJC21). Only the kinase-dead NPR1 failed to reduce PMEP2-lacZ expression, suggesting that the kinase activity of NPR1 is required for the repression of MEP2 expression (Fig. 1B). NPR1 Represses GLN3 but Not GAT1—To determine whether the effect of NPR1 on transcription is mediated by GLN3 and/or the GLN3-like GATA factor GAT1, we measured β-galactosidase activity in npr1, npr1 gln3, and npr1 gat1 mutants containing PMEP2-lacZ. Deletion of GLN3 abolished PMEP2-lacZ expression in an npr1 mutant, whereas loss of GAT1 had no significant effect (Fig. 2A). To extend these observations, we assessed GLN3 and GAT1 localization in wild-type and npr1 cells. GLN3 was localized in the cytoplasm in wild-type cells but was partially nuclear in npr1 cells (Fig. 2B). This nuclear accumulation of GLN3 in npr1 cells was less pronounced than in ure2 cells where GLN3 is strongly nuclear (Fig. 2B), which is consistent with the levels of PMEP2-lacZ expression in npr1 and ure2 strains (Fig. 1B). In contrast, GAT1 was cytoplasmic in both wild-type and npr1 cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, in a ure2 strain there was only a weak accumulation of GAT1 in the nucleus (Fig. 2B), indicating that URE2 regulates the cellular localization of GLN3 but has little effect on GAT1. The above results indicate that NPR1 inhibits GLN3 but not GAT1. NPR1-mediated Inhibition of GLN3 Is Independent of LST4, LST8, and the Intracellular Level of Amino Acids—NPR1 is a protein kinase required for post-Golgi sorting of the general amino acid permease GAP1 and the three known ammonia permeases, MEP1/2/3, to the plasma membrane. It is therefore possible that the loss of NPR1 may indirectly activate GLN3 by altering amino acid and/or ammonia metabolism. However, under the conditions in which we measured GLN3 activity, GAP1 activity is extremely low regardless of expression levels (13Chen E. Kaiser C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14837-14842Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and even if GAP1 is expressed significantly higher in npr1 cells as compared with wild type, GAP1 would still not be expected to reach the plasma membrane (14De Craene J.O. Soetens O. Andre B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To confirm this hypothesis, we considered other mutations known to affect Gap1p sorting to the plasma membrane. lst4 and lst8 mutations, like npr1, prevent GAP1 arrival at the plasma membrane under poor nitrogen conditions (15Roberg K.J. Bickel S. Rowley N. Kaiser C. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1569-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We asked whether an lst4 mutation, like an npr1 mutation, affects GLN3 activity. Loss of LST4 failed to induce PMEP2-lacZ expression (Fig. 3A). We demonstrated previously that cells depleted of LST8 express GLN3-regulated genes at levels similar to those of wild-type cells (16Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). Thus, although loss of NPR1, LST4, or LST8 can affect GAP1 sorting, loss of only NPR1 results in the activation of GLN3 under our experimental conditions. Compared with wild type, cells lacking all three ammonia permeases exhibit a severe growth defect in media containing 1 mm NH +4 but grow normally on media containing 40 mm or more NH4+. Thus, at 76 mm NH +4, the conditions our cells experience, there are additional mechanisms to take up NH +4 ions, so loss of MEP1/2/3 activity caused by the loss of NPR1 does not appear to affect the availability of ammonia for intracellular metabolism. Furthermore, the npr1 strain exhibited the same very mild slow growth defect at 1 mm as at 40 mm NH +4 as assessed by colony size following serial dilution spotting onto solid minimal media (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that GLN3 activation is occurring primarily because of reduced intracellular levels of NH +4. It is possible that GLN3 is activated in npr1 cells because of reduced intracellular amino acid concentrations resulting from altered trafficking of permeases other than GAP1 or MEP1/2/3. To rule out this possibility, we measured the concentration of amino acids in wild type and npr1 strains grown in minimal media (SD) containing only those amino acids required to correct for auxotrophies (His, Leu, and Trp). In the npr1 strain the total amount of all measured amino acids remained similar (Fig. 3B). Importantly, glutamine and glutamate levels were only slightly altered in the npr1 strain as compared with wild type, with glutamine levels slightly increasing and glutamate levels slightly decreasing. We demonstrated previously that GLN3 is activated by a decrease in glutamine (26Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, these minor alterations in amino acid concentrations in an npr1 strain do not correlate with the greatly increased activity of GLN3 in the same strain. Thus, the activation of GLN3 in npr1 cells does not appear to be due to an indirect effect of altered amino acid concentrations that could occur by inappropriate permease sorting. NPR1-mediated Inhibition of GLN3 Is Independent of SIT4 —NPR1 is regulated in part by SIT4 phosphatase, which, in turn, is regulated by TOR (17Jacinto E. Guo B. Arndt K.T. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The SIT4 protein phosphatase is also required for GLN3 activation following rapamycin treatment, so we asked whether GLN3 activation in npr1 cells also requires SIT4. The expression of PMEP2-lacZ in wild type and sit4 strains was similarly low, and in npr1 and npr1 sit4 strains it was similarly high (Fig. 4A). This epistasis of npr1 to sit4 suggests that NPR1 acts downstream of SIT4 in GLN3 repression. We also examined the phosphorylation state of GLN3 in npr1 mutant cells. In npr1 cells GLN3 appears to be phosphorylated as in wild-type cells, because rapamycin treatment increases the mobility of GLN3 (Fig. 4B). The simplest model compatible with these observation is that SIT4 regulates GLN3 via NPR1, but NPR1 does not regulate GLN3 directly. It has been shown that the GLN3 nuclear importin SRP1 is capable of binding only non-phosphorylated GLN3 in vitro, and it has thus been proposed that dephosphorylation of GLN3 is necessary for its nuclear translocation (18Carvalho J. Bertram P.G. Wente S.R. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25359-25365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, in npr1 and ure2 cells GLN3 is phosphorylated and predominantly nuclear, suggesting that the phosphorylation state of GLN3 does not directly regulate its translocation. An alternative model consistent with these data is that GLN3 phosphorylation controls its binding to URE2 (5Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Activation of GLN3 in npr1 Mutants Requires RSP5, BUL1, and BUL2—NPR1 and the E3/E4 ubiquitin ligase complex composed of RSP5, BUL1, and BUL2 control nitrogen-regulated trafficking of GAP1 antagonistically (2Magasanik B. Kaiser C. Gene. 2002; 290: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RSP5 and BUL1/2 are required for GLN3 activation in npr1 cells, we analyzed the expression of PMEP2-lacZ in wild type or npr1 cells lacking RSP5 or BUL1/2. The absence of RSP5 or BUL1/2 alone had no effect on lacZ activity. However, the mutation of either RSP5 or BUL1/2 in npr1 mutant cells completely suppressed MEP2 expression (Fig. 5A), indicating that RSP5 and BUL1/2 are necessary for GLN3 activation in npr1 cells. The finding that rsp5 and bul1/2 mutations are epistatic to npr1 suggests that the ubiquitin ligase is downstream of the NPR1 kinase. BUL1/2 Proteins Are Required for Activation of GLN3 upon a Shift to Proline but Not upon Rapamycin Treatment—To better define the antagonistic role of NPR1 and BUL1/2 in the control of nitrogen-regulated genes, we assessed the relative changes in mRNA levels of a subset of genes known to be regulated by GLN3 in wild type, npr1, and bul1 bul2 cells grown under three different nitrogen related conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). Table II shows the relative changes of a subset of nitrogen source-regulated genes in the three strains mentioned above grown under the following conditions: (i) grown in a good nitrogen source (NH +4); (ii) shifted from a good to a poor nitrogen source for 30 min (NH +4 to proline); and (iii) grown in a good nitrogen source (NH +4) and treated with rapamycin for 30 min. As expected, the known GLN3-regulated genes in Table II were derepressed in npr1 cells and unaltered or down-regulated in bul1 bul2 as compared with wild-type, confirming the antagonistic effect of npr1 and bul1 bul2 mutations. These genes are also all derepressed upon shifting a wild type strain to either proline or treating with rapamycin, events known to increase GLN3-dependent transcription. Although we are preparing a comprehensive genome-wide study of NPR1/BUL-1/2-dependent gene expression, 2S. Helliwell, C. Wiederkehr, P. Demougin, M. Primig, and M. Hall, manuscript in preparation. the subset of known GLN3 regulated genes that we have selected here clearly demonstrates that NPR1 and BUL1/2 are antagonistically involved in the control of GLN3 activity.Table IIFold-induction of known nitrogen source-regulated genes in the strains and conditions notedGeneAmmoniumProline (30 min)Rapamycin (30 min)Nit./GLN3 (Refs.)WTnpr1bul1 bul2WTnpr1bul1 bul2WTnpr1bul1 bul2MEP214.60.4540.56.34.35.612Marini A.M.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5609-5613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Open table in a new tab Proline failed to induce a significant transcriptional response in bul1 bul2 cells (Table II), indicating that these ubiquitination factors are an integral part of the proline-sensing transcription pathway. Curiously, rapamycin-induced transcription of the genes in Table II in bul1 bul2 cells was similar to that of wild type cells. To further investigate the differential effect of proline and rapamycin, we examined the nuclear translocation of GLN3 in wild-type and bul1 bul2 cells following a shift to proline or rapamycin treatment. Consistent with the above findings, both conditions induced nuclear localization of GLN3 in wild type cells, but only rapamycin induced nuclear localization of GLN3 in a bul1 bul2 mutant (Fig. 6). Thus, the BUL1/2 proteins are required for nuclear localization of GLN3 upon a shift to proline but not upon rapamycin treatment, supporting previous suggestions that proline is sensed differently and suggesting that the RSP5/BUL1/2 complex is specifically involved in GLN3 regulation. Indeed, growth in proline specifically activates the rapamycin-sensitive proline utilization pathway, including the transcription factor PUT3 (19Saxena D. Kannan K.B. Brandriss M.C. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that NPR1 is controlled by TOR and the phosphatase SIT4 (17Jacinto E. Guo B. Arndt K.T. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the kinase NPR1 and the E3/E4 ubiquitin ligase complex composed of RSP5 and BUL1/2 have antagonistic roles in the nuclear import and activation of the transcription factor GLN3. NPR1 inhibits and the ubiquitin ligase promotes GLN3 activity. Furthermore, our finding that rsp5 (npi1) and bul1 bul2 mutations are epistatic to an npr1 mutation suggests that the ubiquitin ligase acts downstream of NPR1 in activating GLN3 (Fig. 7). Thus, this may constitute a novel ubiquitin-dependent signaling pathway controlling transcription. The membrane-associated transcription factors SPT23 and MGA1 are ubiquitinated and activated in an RSP5-dependent manner (20Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, we have been unable to detect GLN3 ubiquitination. Alternative possibilities are that the GLN3 inhibitor URE2 or the GLN3 nuclear import machinery is regulated by ubiquitination. In yeast cells grown in a good nitrogen source, GLN3 is repressed by the nitrogen sensing TOR-SIT4 pathway (5Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, we suggest that NPR1 acts downstream of SIT4 to repress GLN3 directly or indirectly. It has been proposed that, under nitrogen rich conditions, NPR1 is phosphorylated and thus inactive toward amino acid permeases (6Schmidt A. Beck T. Koller A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 14De Craene J.O. Soetens O. Andre B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43939-43948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that phosphorylated NPR1 is active with regard to GLN3 repression. Thus phosphorylation of NPR1 may regulate substrate specificity rather than activity per se. Several lines of evidence argue against the idea that npr1 mutation affects GLN3 activity solely indirectly, via altered nitrogen source uptake, due to incorrect nitrogen source permease sorting (21Vandenbol M. Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). First, a reduction in the cytoplasmic nitrogen source would be expected to activate both GLN3 and GAT1, and the npr1 mutation causes constitutive nuclear localization and activation of only GLN3 and not GAT1 (Fig. 2). Second, under the conditions we are using for these experiments (76 mm NH +4), even a strain lacking all three known ammonia permeases (mep1/2/3) can grow perfectly well (12Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and our npr1 strain forms colonies of similar size on solid media containing concentrations of NH +4 ranging from 1 to 80 mm, suggesting that the availability of intracellular ammonia is not significantly compromised. Third, the other permeases that NPR1 is known to positively regulate are GAP1 and PUT4, and neither of these permeases are expected to be active under our experimental conditions regardless of their transcription; also, mutations in genes that also regulate GAP1, LST4 and LST8 do not cause GLN3 activation. Fourth, total and specific intracellular amino acid concentrations do not alter significantly in a npr1 strain as compared with the wild type (Fig. 3B). Thus, although we cannot absolutely rule out that there is some effect due to altered permease sorting, it seems likely that a more direct pathway is involved. Importantly rapamycin but not proline induces GLN3 activation in a bul1 bul2 mutant. Thus, rapamycin-mediated inhibition of the TOR pathway can bypass the requirement for RSP5/BUL1/2 in GLN3 activation. Loss of the GLN3 cytoplasmic binding protein URE2 also circumvents the requirement for the ubiquitination machinery in GLN3 activation (data not shown). Thus, there appears to be two TOR-dependent inputs into GLN3 activation, depending on the nature of the signal. The first would be an RSP5- and BUL1/2-dependent input in response to proline. The second would be an RSP5- and BUL1/2-independent input in response to some other nitrogen source. The qualitative and/or quantitative differences between the signals transduced by these two inputs remains to be elucidated, but either can be sufficient for GLN3 activation. Because a ure2 mutation has a similar effect in a bul1 bul2 mutant as rapamycin treatment, the RSP5-BUL1/2-independent input may be the one controlling the binding of GLN3 to URE2. We thank Dr. B. Andre for materials and Tobias Schmelzle for helpful discussions."

Following that is the helicase domain of LT that has recently been mapped to residues 251-627 (11Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The functional helicase domain actually contains three separable structural domains: a zinc domain from residues 266-345; an AAA+ module from residues 415-548 that participate in ATP binding and hydrolysis; and a globular domain containing residues 346-414 and 549-627 (11Li D.

The helicase domain that is located on the surface also interacts with other key cellular proteins (such as p53, p300/CREB-binding protein, and pol α/primase) and binds single-stranded DNA without sequence specificity, a function essential for the helicase activity (2Simmons D.T.

Despite the growing knowledge regarding the domain structure and functions of LT, it is not clear how different domains of LT are organized relative to each other or whether these separate domains interact with each other within one LT molecule. LT has been reported to exist in multiple oligomeric forms including monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, and pentameric in the absence of ATP+Mg2+ (19Dean F.B. Borowiec J.A. Eki T. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14129-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP+Mg2+, the smaller oligomeric forms assemble into hexamers (19Dean F.B. Borowiec J.A. Eki T. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14129-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or even double hexamers if the origin DNA is also present (10Bullock P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Bullock P.A. Seo Y.S. Hurwitz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2350-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Bullock P.A. Hurwitz J. Cell. 1990; 60: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). All of the oligomeric states previously reported for LT were obtained using native gel shift assay with protein samples treated by cross-linking reagent glutaraldehyde. However, using the gel-filtration chromatography in buffers without any cross-linking reagents, a truncated LT fragment containing residues 251-627 (LT251-627) was shown to form hexamers even in the absence of ATP+Mg2+ (11Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this LT251-627 construct exhibited only one other oligomeric form, possibly a monomer, under the tested condition, which is close to physiological (11Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the behavior of only two discreet oligomeric forms in the absence of cross-linking reagents is unique to this particular LT construct or if it is the common property for other longer LT constructs including the full-length LT. To further understand the biochemical behaviors of LT, the oligomeric states of LT polypeptides of various constructs purified from Escherichia coli as well as insect cells have been characterized under native buffer conditions without cross-linking reagents. In addition, the domain structures and interdomain interactions of LT have been studied using a combination of limited proteolysis and gel-filtration column chromatography on the fast-flow performance liquid chromatography system (FPLC, Amersham Biosciences). Furthermore, the helicase and ATPase activities of the LT proteins have been assayed to further map the helicase domain and to establish the correlation between oligomerization and enzymatic (ATPase and helicase) activities. Here we show that LT proteins of various truncations, even though purified from E. coli, have similar biochemical properties and ATPase/helicase activities to the full-length LT obtained from insect cells. LT Expression and Purification—Various truncated LT constructs for E. coli expression were constructed with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused at the N terminus of LT using pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). In this GST-LT fusion protein, a thrombin cleavage site is placed at the boundary between GST and LT. The expression of the GST-LT fusion proteins in E. coli was controlled under Ptac promoter. To induce the expression of the fusion proteins, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the E. coli cells at a density of A600 = 0.4 at room temperature (25 °C). To purify the proteins, E. coli cells expressing the GST-LT fusion proteins were lysed by sonication in a buffer L (containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After separating the soluble supernatant of the cell lysates from the pellet by centrifugation (25,000 × g), the fusion proteins in the supernatant fraction were purified by passing through the glutathione affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by washing the column with 10× bed volume of buffer L. To separate LT from the GST fusion, thrombin was used to cleave the GST-LT fusion. The thrombin-cleaved proteins were concentrated for further purification with gel-filtration chromatography on a Superdex-200 column with buffer S (containing 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The expression and purification of the full-length LT (LT1-708) from insect cells was performed as previously described (22Hoss A. Moarefi I. Scheidtmann K.H. Cisek L.J. Corden J.L. Dornreiter I. Arthur A.K. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4799-4807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Limited Trypsin Digestion and Characterization of the Digested Products—Limited trypsin digestion of LT was performed at room temperature, and the digestion was terminated at the designed time interval by adding 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer followed by immediate boiling. The trypsin to LT ratio (wt/wt) used was 1:400. If ATP or ATP+Mg2+ were included in the digestion, LT was first incubated with 1 mm ATP or 1 mm ATP plus 3 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at room temperature before adding trypsin. For N-terminal sequencing, the tryptic LT samples were prepared in two ways. One was to separate all of the obvious cleavage fragments shown on SDS-PAGE and then blot them to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) for the N-terminal sequencing of each individual fragment. This method of preparing the sample gives unambiguous sequencing results for each isolated fragment but may only obtain the N-terminal sequences of those that show up well in the SDS-PAGE gel. To avoid missing the N-terminal sequences of small cleavage fragments that do not stain well or run well on the gel, the bulk of digested LT fragments were also directly subjected to N-terminal sequencing. For gel-filtration chromatography, prepacked Superdex-200 column (16/60) from Amersham Biosciences was used on the ΔKTA FPLC system. The column was equilibrated with 1.5× bed volume of buffer S (containing 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) before the protein samples were injected onto the column. A flow rate of 1 ml/min (a pressure <42 p.s.i.) was used for the chromatography run. Helicase Assay—For the helicase assay, the double-stranded DNA substrate is made from the annealed product between a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide primer and the M13mp19 single-stranded DNA, which is adapted from previously reported M13 substrates (23Poplawski A. Grabowski B. Long S.E. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49371-49377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15049-15059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primer contains 60 nucleotides with the sequence of 5′-TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTC GCG CGG GGA GAG GCG GTT TGC GTA TTG GGC GCC-3′. Its 5′-end was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by the polynucleotide kinase. The labeled primer was then annealed with M13mp19 single-stranded DNA, and the resulting double-stranded DNA substrate was purified with a Sephacryl 300HR column as described previously (23Poplawski A. Grabowski B. Long S.E. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49371-49377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Approximately 10 fmol of substrate DNA was incubated with ∼2 pmol of LT proteins (monomer) of various constructs in a helicase buffer H containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by introducing SDS to a final concentration of 0.25% and EDTA to 50 mm. The samples then were analyzed with 12% native polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The gel was dried, and positions of the labeled DNA were detected using autoradiography. ATPase Assay—For the ATPase assay, 4 pmol of LT proteins (monomer) from various constructs were incubated with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 10 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at room temperature. 20% of the reaction mixtures were spotted and dried on a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate (Selecto Scientific). The TLC plate was placed in a developing buffer containing 2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m LiCl for 2 h. The plate then was air-dried, and the positions of the radioisotope were detected with autoradiography. Protein Expression and Purification—LT proteins with different truncations have been purified from either insect cells or from E. coli. The full-length LT protein (LT1-708) was expressed and purified from insect cells as described previously (22Hoss A. Moarefi I. Scheidtmann K.H. Cisek L.J. Corden J.L. Dornreiter I. Arthur A.K. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4799-4807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The shorter LT polypeptides were expressed and purified from E. coli as GST fusions at their N termini. The GST fusion proteins were cleaved by thrombin to separate GST and LT moiety. After a final purification step using Superdex-200 gelfiltration chromatography on FPLC, all of the proteins have a purity of >95% (Fig. 2). The yields of LT polypeptides from E. coli varied depending on the constructs. The general trend is that the longer the constructs, the lower the yield. Approximately 0.2 mg of LT131-627/liter of cell culture was obtained; however, as much as 10 mg of LT303-627 could be purified from 1 liter of cell culture. Oligomeric States of LT in the Presence and Absence of ATP/ADP and Mg2+ Ion—It has been reported that full-length LT exists in multiple oligomeric states ranging from monomeric through hexameric as assayed by a cross-linking experiment in solutions containing glutaraldehyde (19Dean F.B. Borowiec J.A. Eki T. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14129-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the deletion construct of LT containing residues 251-627 exhibited only two oligomeric states, hexameric and monomeric, as assayed by gelfiltration chromatography in a buffer solution without any cross-linking reagent (11Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To understand whether the two-oligomeric phenomenon is unique to LT251-627 or is a general feature for other LT constructs, LT polypeptides of various constructs, including the full-length LT, were subjected to gel-filtration chromatography analysis using a Superdex-200 column on the FPLC system under physiological buffer conditions. The elution profiles of all of the tested LT constructs on the gel-filtration chromatography are shown in Fig. 3. For the full-length LT (Fig. 3A, LT1-708), two prominent elution peaks (pk1 and pk2) were present in the absence of ATP+Mg2+ (red line). The relative ratio of the two-peak height (pk1:pk2) changes depending on the protein concentration; the higher the protein concentration, the larger the ratio of pk1:pk2, suggesting high protein concentration favoring pk1 formation. In addition, there is a small shoulder peak (sPk) at the void volume position (peak at ∼46 ml) that contains protein aggregates (but soluble) with a large molecular mass beyond the resolution limit of this column (∼700 kDa). The first elution peak (pk1) has an apparent molecular mass (MM) of 540 kDa, consistent with a hexameric form of LT with a calculated MM of 490 kDa. The second peak (pk2) has an apparent MM of 138 kDa, which is between the calculated MMs of a monomer (81.6 kDa) and a dimer (163 kDa). When ATP was added to the protein and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C before the sample was injected onto the gel-filtration column, the elution profile of LT1-708 changed dramatically (blue line). Now, the height of pk2 almost reduced to base line, whereas that of the hexameric pk1 increased correspondingly, suggesting that the protein in pk2 shifts into hexameric forms in the presence of ATP. ADP has a similar effect in shifting the protein in pk2 to pk1 under the test condition (green line). Similar to full-length LT, two other truncated LT constructs, including LT131-627 and LT262-627, also showed two discreet peaks (pk1 and pk2) in their elution profiles in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 3, B and C, red lines). Pk1 of LT131-627 has an apparent MM of 330 kDa (Fig. 3B), consistent with a hexameric form (calculated MM of 351 kDa). Pk2 of LT131-627 has an apparent MM of 82 kDa, which is closer to the calculated MM of a monomer (57.5 kDa) than that of a dimer (115 kDa). For the LT262-627 construct, pk1 has an apparent MM of 246 kDa (Fig. 3C), again consistent with a hexameric form with a calculated MM of 252 kDa. pk2 of LT262-627 has an apparent MM of 55 kDa similar to the calculated MM of a monomer (43.1 kDa). For both LT131-627 and LT262-627 constructs similar to LT1-708, the elution profiles in the presence of ATP or ADP have a reduced pk2 and increased pk1 (Fig. 3, B and C, blue and green lines), suggesting an ability of ATP or ADP to shift the proteins in the oligomeric state in peak 2 to the hexameric state in peak 1. However, for construct LT303-627, the polypeptide only eluted as a single peak regardless of the presence or absence of ATP (or ADP) treatment before chromatography (Fig. 3D), suggesting the lack of conformational change when ATP/ADP was added. The peak position has an apparent MM of 49 kDa similar to the calculated MM of a monomer for this fragment (38.1 kDa). Even though both ATP and ADP can shift the LT proteins of various constructs from the oligomeric state in pk2 to the hexameric state in pk1, the residual pk2 height in the presence of ADP (green lines in Fig. 3) is always higher than that in the presence of ATP under the same nucleotide concentration (blue lines in Fig. 3), suggesting a less efficient hexamerization of LT in the presence of ADP. This phenomenon is consistent with the previous finding that ADP has lower affinity for LT than ATP (26Huang S.G. Weisshart K. Fanning E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15336-15344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This difference between ATP and ADP becomes more evident with the shorter construct, LT262-627. Whereas the peak heights of pk2 for LT1-708 and LT131-627 were reduced to almost background level when ADP was present (Fig. 3, A and B), the residual pk2 of LT262-627 was quite large in the presence of ADP (Fig. 3C, green line), suggesting that the hexameric forms of the shorter LT construct is not very stable even in the presence of ADP. Another observation is that the residual pk2 positions in the presence of ATP or ADP in Fig. 3 are slightly later (∼0.8-1.5 ml) than the pk2 positions in the absence of nucleotides for all of the constructs with the exception of LT303-627 (Fig. 3, A-C). Because a later elution peak means a smaller apparent MM, the presence of nucleotides (ATP/ADP) may trigger a structural change that leads to a more compact conformation, thus behaving as a smaller MM in gel filtration. ATPase and Helicase Activities of Different Deletion Constructs—To test whether the various deletion LT constructs from E. coli have enzymatic activities, ATPase and helicase assays were performed. With the exception of LT303-627, all of the tested LT constructs including wild type LT from insect cells showed comparable level of ATPase activity (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the helicase assay showed that all of the LT constructs with the exception of LT303-627 had helicase activity (Fig. 4B, lanes 3-7). Judging from the band intensity of the unwound single-stranded DNA product in Fig. 4B, the helicase activities of the deletion constructs are somewhat comparable with those of the full-length LT. The Characterization of LT Domain Structure—To investigate the domain structure of the full-length LT as well as to probe the domain interactions of LT, we used a combination of methods including limited protease (trypsin) digestion in the presence and absence of ATP plus/minus Mg2+ ion, N-terminal sequencing of the cleavage fragments, and gel-filtration chromatography of the trypsinized LT protein. The full-length LT (LT1-708) from insect cells and LT131-627 purified from E. coli were first treated with trypsin in the absence or presence of ATP and Mg2+ for different lengths of time followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Distinct tryptic band patterns generated in the presence or absence of ATP and Mg2+ ion were shown on the denaturing SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 5A). In the absence of ATP and Mg2+, 10 tryptic bands were detected including four major bands with apparent MMs of 40, 31, 27, and 17 kDa and five minor bands at 66-, 60-, 43-, 26-, and 25-kDa positions (Fig. 5A, lanes 3-5). However, in the presence of ATP+Mg2+, there are only three major tryptic bands with apparent MMs of 66, 60, and 17 kDa plus two minor bands at the 40/43-kDa position (Fig. 5A, lanes 6-8). Interestingly, the trypsin digestion with ATP but without Mg2+ yielded a somewhat different band pattern (Fig. 5A, lanes 9 and 10) from that either with ATP+Mg2+ (Fig. 5A, lanes 6-7) or without ATP+Mg2+ (Fig. 5A, lanes 3-5). This pattern with only ATP but without Mg2+ showed fewer tryptic bands than that derived without ATP+Mg2+, but it showed more bands than that with ATP+Mg2+. Similar effects of ATP and Mg2+ on changing trypsin digestion pattern were also observed for LT131-627 (Fig. 5A, lanes 11-13). To learn the trypsin cleavage sites on LT that indicate the accessibility of the sites in the folded structure, the tryptic fragments obtained with/without ATP+Mg2+ were N-terminally sequenced and the sequencing results are shown in Fig. 5B. Based on the N-terminal sequencing results as well as the apparent MM of the tryptic fragments on SDS-PAGE, a trypsin cleavage map showing the cleavage positions on LT polypeptide, as well as the resulting fragments, was derived (Fig. 5C). In the presence of ATP+Mg2+, the cleavage by trypsin occurred only at two locations: residue 131 and 651 (indicated by arrows in Fig. 5C). A possible third cleavage site at 126 is deduced by the presence of a smaller 16-kDa fragment that is co-N-terminal with the 17-kDa fagment (Fig. 5, B and C). Whereas the cleavage in the absence of ATP and Mg2+ was observed to occur at seven locations (red and black arrows in Fig. 5C), the estimated MMs of the cleavage products on SDS-PAGE are mostly consistent with the calculated MMs based on the amino acid composition of these products. Interactions between Different LT Domains—Three of the four major structural and functional domains of LT have been solved separately using either x-ray crystallography or NMR methods. These three domains with known structures are (counting from the N terminus) as follows: the DnaJ homology domain (residues 1-117) (27Kim H.Y. Ahn B.Y. Cho Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); the OBD domain (residues 131-260) (9Luo X. Sanford D.G. Bullock P.A. Bachovchin W.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); and the helicase domain (residues 251-627) (11Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), leaving the C-terminal HR fragment (residues 628-708), the only major domain, with missing structural information. Despite extensive efforts, the following important issues still remain to be addressed: how these four domains are organized in an intact LT molecule; whether the four domains interact with each other; and if they do, how the four domains interact with each other intramolecularly in a monomeric LT and intermolecularly in an oligomeric LT. To address some aspects of the above issues, which are important for understanding the complex functions of LT, limited protease (trypsin) treatment was employed to cleave the native LT protein at the accessible sites followed by gel-filtration column chromatography to test whether the cleaved products migrate as individual fragments or as multiple fragment complex that are associated with each other. The rationale for this experiment is that, if the individual fragments elute in separate peaks according to their sizes, these fragments are not interacting with each other. Conversely, if the individual fragment elute together with other parts of the molecule in a peak with apparent MMs larger than the individual fragments, it suggests that the fragments interact with each other. To examine the interactions of fragments coming from a different portion of LT (i.e. N and C termini), it is important to select a suitable condition for trypsin digestion so that a moderate number of fragments are generated. The digestion condition used in lanes 9-10 of Fig. 5A in which LT was digested into three major fragments was chosen for this experiment. The critical feature of this digestion condition is that trypsin treatment is performed in the presence of ATP but in the absence of Mg2+ ion. Such trypsin digestion of LT generated the cleavage products that contained the N-terminal 16/17-kDa fragment (LT1-130) and the C-terminal 66/60-kDa fragment that are further cleaved into 43/40 fragments, a 27-kDa fragment, and the C-terminal 25/26-kDa fragment (Fig. 6, A and C, lane 2). When this trypsin-digested LT was subjected to the gel-filtration chromatography on Superdex-200 column, an elution profile with three prominent elution peaks (pk1, pk2, and pk3) and an sPk at the void volume was obtained (Fig. 6B). Pk1 has an apparent MM of 478 kDa, slightly smaller than the calculated MM of a full-length LT hexamer (∼490 kDa), suggesting that LT proteins in this peak may be in a hexameric form. Interestingly, SDS-PAGE of this peak (Fig. 6C, lane 4) showed that it contains all of the trypsin-cleaved fragments that are present in the sample before being loaded o"

To investigate the structural motifs involved in these initial sorting events, we have generated a variety of loss-of-function and gain-of-function GLUT4/GLUT1 chimera proteins. Substitution of the GLUT4 carboxyl-terminal domain with GLUT1 had no significant effect on the acquisition of insulin responsiveness. In contrast, substitution of either the GLUT4 amino-terminal domain or the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 resulted in the rapid default of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane with blunted insulin response. Consistent with these findings, substitution of the amino-terminal, cytoplasmic loop, or carboxyl-terminal domains individually into GLUT1 backbone did not recapitulate normal GLUT4 trafficking. Similarly, dual substitutions of the GLUT1 amino and carboxyl termini with GLUT4 domains or the combination of the cytoplasmic loop plus the carboxyl terminus failed to display normal GLUT4 trafficking. However, the dual replacement of the amino terminus plus the cytoplasmic loop of GLUT4 in the GLUT1 backbone resulted in a complete restoration of normal GLUT4 trafficking. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the GLUT4 amino terminus demonstrated that Phe5 and Ile8 within the FQQI motif and, to a lesser extent, Asp12/Gly13 were necessary for the appropriate initial trafficking following biosynthesis. In addition, amino acids 229–271 in the large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 functionally cooperated with the amino-terminal domain. These data demonstrate that initial trafficking of GLUT4 from the Golgi to the insulin-responsive GLUT4 compartment requires the functional interaction of two distinct domains.

The facilitative glucose transporters constitute an extensive family of 12 membrane-spanning glycoproteins that are characterized by their different tissue distribution patterns and biochemical properties (reviewed in Refs. 1Wood I.S. Trayhurn P. Br. J. Nutr. 2003; 89: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar and 2Joost H.G. Thorens B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). GLUT4 is unique among the facilitative glucose transporters as it is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac), the sites responsible for postprandial glucose uptake (3Bryant N.J.

The first glucose transporter identified, GLUT1 is responsible for basal glucose uptake with its predominantly plasma membrane localization and wide pattern of tissue expression (5Holman G.D.

Diabetes Metab. 2002; 28: 85-92PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the overall 65% amino acid identity between GLUT4 and GLUT1 with the same predicted secondary structure, general kinetic characteristics, and stereospecificity transport, these two proteins display markedly different intracellular trafficking properties. In the basal state, GLUT1 is plasma membrane-localized with a relatively small amount found in intracellular membrane compartments (8Hudson A.W. Ruiz M. Birnbaum M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Shibasaki Y. Asano T. Lin J.L. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Ishihara H. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of GLUT4 is found in various intracellular compartments with only a small amount found at the plasma membrane. Both of these glucose transporter proteins continuously recycle, but the exocytotic rate of GLUT1 is relatively high, whereas the exocytotic rate of GLUT4 is relatively low when compared with the rate of endocytosis (10Jhun B.H.

Although insulin stimulation has only a marginal effect on the rate of GLUT1 trafficking, it markedly enhances the rate of GLUT4 exocytosis. Thus, the insulin stimulation of GLUT4 exocytosis accounts for the large increase of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane in the postprandial state. Recent studies have suggested that GLUT1, as well as other constitutively recycling membrane proteins, traffic between the plasma membrane and early endosome compartments. In contrast, GLUT4 is thought to undergo sequestration from these recycling early endosomes by recycling continuously to and from other endosome compartments and/or the trans-Golgi network (13Karylowski O. Zeigerer A. Cohen A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 14Martin S. Tellam J. Livingstone C. Slot J.W. Gould G.W. James D.E. J.

Cell. 2003; 14: 973-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation results in the exit of GLUT4 from these storage compartments and entry into the constitutively recycling early endosome compartments that contain GLUT1 and other constitutively trafficking proteins such as the transferrin receptor (16Livingstone C. James D.E. Rice J.E. Hanpeter D. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To identify specific GLUT4 domains that are responsible for its unique trafficking properties, several laboratories have examined the localization of GLUT4/GLUT1 or GLUT4/transferrin receptor chimeras (reviewed in Refs. 5Holman G.D. Sandoval I.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and 18Lalioti V. Vergarajauregui S. Sandoval I.V. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, these studies have resulted in remarkably divergent and inconsistent conclusions. Initial studies suggested that the amino-terminal hydrophilic domain of GLUT4 is both necessary and sufficient for its intracellular sequestration and identified Phe5 as a key residue (19Piper R.C. Tai C. Kulesza P. Pang S. Warnock D. Baenziger J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Puri C. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Piper R.C. Tai C. Slot J.W. Hahn C.S. Rice C.M. Huang H. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies reported that the major determinant of GLUT4 localization resides in the carboxyl-terminal sequences, with a dileucine motif at positions 489 and 490 identified as a critical component (21Czech M.P.

Levy M.A. Strube M.S. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 641-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some of these studies showed that point mutations of either Phe5 or Leu489/Leu490 resulted in inappropriate targeting of GLUT4 to the cell surface (19Piper R.C. Tai C. Kulesza P. Pang S.

Alternatively, another study suggested that several non-contiguous domains function cooperatively to correctly target GLUT4 (26Asano T. Takata K. Katagiri H. Tsukuda K. Lin J.L. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Hirano H. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19636-19641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, both the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal GLUT4 domains were found not to be responsible for selective intracellular retention but serve as important plasma membrane endocytotic domains (27Garippa R.J. Judge T.W. James D.E. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Corvera S. Chawla A. Chakrabarti R. Joly M. Buxton J. Czech M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been suggested that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains are both required for efficient GLUT4 trafficking regulation by functioning at distinct intracellular sorting steps. The amino-terminal 5FQQI8 motif has also been implicated in the sorting of GLUT4 out of early endosomes (29Palacios S. Lalioti V. Martinez-Arca S. Chattopadhyay S. Sandoval I.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3371-3383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Melvin D.R. Marsh B.J. Walmsley A.R. James D.E. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas the Leu489/Leu490 motif may contribute to the movement of GLUT4 from the trans-Golgi network to recycling endosomes or from the trans-Golgi network to the GLUT4 storage compartments (GSCs) 1The abbreviations used are: GSC, GLUT4 storage compartment; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: GSC, GLUT4 storage compartment; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, other domains have recently been implicated in the regulated trafficking of GLUT4. In particular, an acidic cluster adjacent to the dileucine motif in the carboxyl terminus (498TELEYLGP505) has been implicated in intracellular targeting and sorting from recycling endosomes to the insulin-responsive storage compartments and Tyr502 with the terminal residues 505PDEND509 in modulating GLUT4 retention within the GLUT4 storage compartments (31Martinez-Arca S. Lalioti V.S. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Shewan A.M. Marsh B.J. Melvin D.R. Martin S. Gould G.W. James D.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although a few studies have examined the trafficking of GLUT4 following cell surface labeling, the majority have not accounted for the dynamic and continuous trafficking properties of GLUT4. Thus, the analysis of GLUT4 distribution was determined after long term expression in which GLUT4 has equilibrated throughout its entire trafficking pathway. Moreover, many of these studies have utilized deletions or mutations and have inferred the importance of specific motifs from the apparent loss-of-function. To address these issues, we have recently reported that following initial biosynthesis, GLUT4 directly traffics from the secretory membrane system (Golgi/trans-Golgi network) to the specialized GLUT4 storage compartments without transiting the plasma membrane (33Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Furukawa M. Hou J.C. Li L. Kanzaki M. Okada S. Kandror K.V. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2059-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Through the examination of the trafficking of newly synthesized GLUT4, we are able to eliminate the effect of plasma membrane endocytosis and endosome recycling, thus allowing us to selectively identify sequence motifs responsible for the initial entry into the insulin-responsive GLUT4 storage compartments. In this study, we have used both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations to conclusively demonstrate that the amino-terminal domain and large cytoplasmic loop are both necessary and sufficient to confer the appropriate trafficking of GLUT4 from the secretory membrane transport system to the GSC. Materials—Mini-prep DNA and DNA gel extraction kits were purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). PfuTurbo DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Insulin, dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine, bovine serum albumin, and donkey serum were purchased from Sigma. Vectashield was obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Plasmids—A pcDNA3-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) plasmid was prepared by cloning the EGFP cDNA (Clontech) into the NotI-XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 obtained from Invitrogen. The wild type GLUT4-EGFP and the wild type GLUT1-EGFP cDNA constructs were prepared by subcloning the full-length rat GLUT4 or rat GLUT1 cDNAs in-frame into the EcoRI-NotI sites of the pcDNA3-EGFP vector to generate the carboxyl-terminal EGFP fusion proteins. The previous constructs were used as templates to generate various GLUT4/GLUT1 chimera proteins by overlapping polymerase chain reaction procedures. The resulting products were cloned into Topo® vector (Invitrogen), digested, and subcloned again into the pcDNA3-EGFP vector using the EcoRI-NotI sites to obtain the different chimera fusion proteins. The chimera constructs were then sequenced in their entirety to check for unexpected mutations. In Fig. 1, a schematic representation of the different GLUT4/GLUT1 chimeras generated is shown. The nomenclature used is based on the form #–###, with the first number (1 or 4) representing the parental protein backbone, GLUT1 or GLUT4. The numbers on the right indicate to which isoform, GLUT1 or GLUT4, corresponds each one of the three intracellular regions exchanged: amino-terminal, intracellular loop, or carboxyl-terminal. For example, the chimera 4–144 is a loss-of-function chimera made in a GLUT4 backbone, which contains the amino terminus of GLUT1 and the intracellular loop and carboxyl terminus of GLUT4. Another set of chimeras was generated as a variation of chimera 1–441 containing partial substitutions of the intracellular loop. The schematic representation of these mutants with the chimeric cytoplasmic loops named 4A, 4B, and 4C is shown in Fig. 8A.Fig. 8The large intracellular GLUT4 loop (amino acids 229–271) functionally cooperates with the amino-terminal domain.A, schematic representation of the variants of chimera 1–441 (chimeric loops named 4A to 4C). Dark gray, GLUT4; pale gray, GLUT1. To simplify, the numbers of the amino acids indicated in the chimeras correspond only to GLUT4. B–D, differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were electroporated with 50 μg of chimeras 1–44A1 (B), 1–44B1 (C), and 1–44C1 (D). Insulin stimulation (100 nm, 30 min) was performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after transfection. The cells were then processed for fluorescent microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open circles, basal; solid squares, insulin. Values are presented as percentage (mean ± S.E.) of cells showing a plasma membrane (PM) ring obtained by counting 50 cells/condition in 3–5 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Alanine-scanning Mutagenesis—Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate sequential alanine mutations across the amino terminus of GLUT4. The region amplified corresponds to GLUT4 amino acids 1–132. The mutated EcoRI-SacII fragment obtained was replaced in each case into the pcDNA3 wild type GLUT4-EGFP construct and then sequenced. The amino terminus of the different alanine mutants aligned with wild type GLUT4 is shown in Fig. 6. The alanine mutants were named based upon the two amino acid substitutions performed in each case. Culture and Transient Transfection of 3T3L1 Adipocytes—Murine 3T3L1 preadipocytes were purchased from the American Type Tissue Culture repository. Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 8% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% bovine calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Two days past confluence, differentiation into adipocytes was induced by changing the medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 μg/ml insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine. After 4 days, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml insulin and maintained for 4 additional days. Fully differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were transiently transfected by electroporation as described previously (34Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, the adipocytes were put into suspension by mild trypsinization and electroporated with 50 μg of plasmid DNA under low voltage conditions (160 V, 950 microfarads). After electroporation, the cells were seeded on collagen-coated glass coverslips placed in 6-well plates with complete medium to allow them to recover. Time Course Experiments—Differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes expressing the different EGFP-tagged plasmids were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2–2.5 h prior to each experiment. The incubation with or without insulin (100 nm) for 30 min was done at the determined time to end the experiments exactly 3, 6, 9, 12, or 24 h after transfection. The cells were quickly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and blocked with a solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% donkey serum for another 15 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in Vectashield medium. The translocation of the different GLUT constructs to the plasma membrane was analyzed the next day by wide-field fluorescent microscopy. Translocation data in 3T3L1 adipocytes are expressed as a percent (mean ± S.E.) of positive cells, those showing a plasma membrane ring, obtained by counting 50 cells/condition in 2–5 independent experiments, as described previously (33Watson R.T.

Time-dependent Acquisition of Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 Translocation—It is well established that the steady-state distribution of GLUT1 in unstimulated adipocytes is primarily plasma membrane, whereas GLUT4 is predominantly confined to intracellular compartments (5Holman G.D. Sandoval I.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To compare the time-dependent acquisition of insulin-stimulated translocation for newly synthesized GLUT4 and GLUT1 proteins, 3T3L1 adipocytes were transfected with the GLUT4-EGFP or GLUT1-EGFP cDNAs (Fig. 2). As observed previously (33Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Furukawa M. Hou J.C. Li L. Kanzaki M. Okada S. Kandror K.V. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2059-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), 3 h following expression, a large fraction of GLUT1 was already localized to the plasma membrane and slowly increased over the next 9 h (Fig. 2A). As expected, there was little, if any, acute (30 min) insulin stimulation of GLUT1 translocation. In contrast, the newly synthesized GLUT4 protein remained intracellular in the basal state with no evidence for any significant plasma membrane accumulation over the 12-h time course examined (Fig. 2B). Although insulin stimulation had no significant effect 3 h after transfection, at 6 h, the newly synthesized GLUT4 protein began to display detectable insulin responsiveness. The extent of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation progressively increased over the next 6 h. These data are in agreement with previous data demonstrating that the newly synthesized GLUT4 protein requires 6–9 h to appropriately sort through the secretory membrane system and accumulate in the GSC without transiting the plasma membrane (33Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Furukawa M. Hou J.C. Li L. Kanzaki M. Okada S. Kandror K.V. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2059-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Substitution of Either the GLUT4 Amino-terminal or the Large Intracellular Loop Domains with GLUT1 Inhibits Intracellular Retention—The most divergent amino acid regions between GLUT4, GLUT1, and other isoforms of the GLUT family of transporters are the amino and carboxyl termini and the large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7. To determine the domains responsible for the distinct subcellular targeting of GLUT4 and GLUT1, we first generated a set of loss-of-function mutants by replacement of the corresponding domains of GLUT4 with the equivalent regions of GLUT1 (Fig. 1B). Substitution of the GLUT4 amino-terminal domain (4–144) or cytoplasmic loop (4–414) with GLUT1 resulted in a loss of basal state retention and almost no significant insulin-stimulated translocation of these chimera proteins (Fig. 3, A and B). The relatively rapid default to the plasma membrane, however, was not as fast as that observed for wild type GLUT1. In contrast, substitution of the GLUT4 carboxyl-terminal domain with GLUT1-(4–441) had no significant effect on the basal and time-dependent acquisition of insulin-responsive GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 3C). The importance of the amino-terminal and cytoplasmic loop domains was further confirmed by expression of a double substitution mutant (4–114). This chimera demonstrated a relatively rapid default to the plasma membrane without any significant insulin-stimulated translocation at any of the time points examined (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of GLUT4 does not carry any information required for the initial trafficking of GLUT4 from the secretory membrane transport system to the GSC or insulin-stimulated exit from this compartment. Furthermore, since the double substitution mutant has trafficking characteristics more similar to GLUT1 than either of the single domain substitutions alone, this suggests that both of these domains contribute to this function. Substitution of Both the GLUT1 Amino-terminal and the Large Intracellular Loop Domains with GLUT4 Is Sufficient to Recapitulate Normal GLUT4 Trafficking—One caveat associated with the loss-of-function analysis determined in Fig. 3 is that these domain swaps could result in an aberrantly folded or assembled protein rather than reflecting the requirement of these domains. To address this, we prepared a series of gain-of-function chimeras in which these domains of GLUT4 were substituted into the GLUT1 protein (Fig. 1C). As observed for the amino-terminal domain loss-of-function mutant, substitution of the GLUT4 amino terminus into GLUT1-(1–411) resulted in a partial, but relatively small, rescue of the GLUT4 phenotype (Fig. 4A). That is, the rate of plasma membrane appearance was not as fast as wild type GLUT1, and there was a small degree of insulin-stimulated translocation between 6 and 12 h following new synthesis. Substitution of the GLUT4 cytoplasmic loop (1–141) or the carboxyl-terminal domain (1–114) resulted in a trafficking pattern not significantly different from the wild type GLUT1 protein (Fig. 4, B and C). These data suggest that each of these single domains alone is not sufficient to recapitulate the initial trafficking properties of wild type GLUT4. Next, we examined the effect of dual GLUT4 domain substitutions into the GLUT1 backbone (Fig. 5). Substitution of the large cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl-terminal GLUT4 domains into GLUT1-(1–144) resulted in a chimera protein that still rapidly defaulted to the plasma membrane but did display a weak insulin-stimulated translocation (Fig. 5A). Replacement of GLUT1 with the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal GLUT4 domains (1–414) partially resembled wild type GLUT4 but with the presence of a high basal default transport to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5B). In contrast, substitution of the amino-terminal and large cytoplasmic loop GLUT4 domains into GLUT1-(1–441) fully recapitulated the full retention and time-dependent acquisition of insulin-stimulated translocation (Fig. 5C). Similarly, substitution of the GLUT4 amino-, loop, and carboxyl-terminal domains in the GLUT1 backbone (1–444) also resulted in the identical initial kinetics of basal and insulin-stimulated translocation as the wild type GLUT4 and the 1–441 chimera (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that a combination of both the GLUT4 amino-terminal and cytoplasmic loop domains is necessary and sufficient for the appropriate intracellular sequestration and initial trafficking of the newly synthesized GLUT4 protein. The 5FQQI8 Motif within the Amino-terminal Domain of GLUT4 Is the Major Determinant for Its Intracellular Localization—To further define the amino acids responsible for the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking during these initial sorting events, we generated alanine-scanning mutants across the amino-terminal domain of GLUT4. Fig. 6 shows an alignment of the amino terminus of wild type GLUT4 and the 11 alanine mutants generated. The alanine mutants are named with the indication of the two amino acid substitutions performed in each case. As a first approach, we analyzed the percentage of translocation of these 11 mutants at 24 h after transfection to determine the amount of basal and insulin-stimulated translocation under steady-state conditions (data not shown). In this analysis, mutants G4A/F5A, I8A/G9A, and to a lesser extent, Q6A/Q7A and D12A/G13A, showed a higher percentage of translocated cells in the basal state. Based upon these data, we examined the time dependence of basal and insulin-stimulated plasma membrane localization for several selected point mutants (Fig. 7). The G4A/F5A and I8A/G9A mutants had a high rate of basal transport to the plasma membrane essentially identical to that observed for the GLUT1 amino-terminal domain substitution (4–144) in GLUT4 (Fig. 7, A and B). Unexpectedly, the behavior of the Q6A/Q7A mutant was essentially identical to wild type GLUT4 during this early time course (Fig. 7C). These data indicate that Phe5 and Ile8 are the critical residues within the FQQI motif, whereas the diglutamine residues are dispensable. Although other mutations across the amino terminus had no significant effect on the initial properties of GLUT4 trafficking, the D12A/G13A mutant had a small but significant increase in basal trafficking to the plasma membrane (Fig. 7D). Together these data demonstrate that the key residues in the GLUT4 amino terminus responsible for the appropriate initial sorting into and exit from the GSC are Phe5, Ile8, and to a lesser extent, Asp12 and Gly13. The Large Intracellular GLUT4 Loop (Amino Acids 229–271) Functionally Cooperates with the Amino Terminus—To further examine the regions of the large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7, we generated another set of gain-of-function mutants as variants of chimera 1–441. In these chimeras, the amino terminus of GLUT4 and three different regions of the cytoplasmic loop (named 4A to 4C) were replaced into GLUT1 (Fig. 8A). Substitution of the amino terminus of GLUT4 plus the first half (1–44A1) or the middle region (1–44B1) of the GLUT4 loop into GLUT1 partially recapitulated normal GLUT4 trafficking but with a slightly higher level of plasma membrane localization in the basal state (Fig. 8, B and C). In contrast, substitution of the second half of the loop together with the amino-terminal domain of GLUT4 into GLUT1-(1–44C1) did not display any significant difference when compared with the 1–411 chimera (Fig. 8D). These data suggest that amino acids in the third part of the intracellular loop of GLUT4 are not required for the appropriate initial trafficking of GLUT4 and retention into the GSC. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the amino terminus plus the continuous sequence of the large intracellular loop (amino acids 229–271) are required to recapitulate newly synthesized GLUT4 trafficking. It is well known that in muscle and adipose tissue, the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 slowly recycles between the plasma membrane and various intracellular compartments with the steady-state levels at the cell surface determined by the relative rates of exocytosis and endocytosis (5Holman G.D.

Insulin stimulation results in a marked enhancement in the rate of exocytosis with a small, if any, decrease in the rate of endocytosis.

The interpretation of these data is difficult as an alteration of one trafficking step can appear to affect a different step that is kinetically linked. Moreover, specific structural motifs may be required for unique trafficking steps, whereas other motifs may be required at multiple sorting steps, providing overlapping function. Despite these caveats, it is generally accepted that both the amino-terminal FQQI motif and the carboxyl-terminal SLL motif are necessary for efficient plasma membrane endocytosis (27Garippa R.J. Judge T.W. James D.E. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Corvera S. Chawla A. Chakrabarti R. Joly M. Buxton J. Czech M.P. J.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 131-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have observed that newly synthesized GLUT4 protein traffics through the secretory membrane system (endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus) and is then directly sorted to the specialized GLUT4 storage compartments without having to transit the plasma membrane to acquire insulin responsiveness (33Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Furukawa M. Hou J.C. Li L. Kanzaki M. Okada S. Kandror K.V. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2059-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the basal state, there is a slow exit of GLUT4 from the GSC and subsequent traffic to the plasma membrane followed by endocytosis and recycling back to the GSC. These data demonstrated that time-dependent acquisition of insulin responsiveness correlates with the entry of the newly synthesized GLUT4 protein into the GSC. Based upon these data, we took advantage of the temporal separation of these events to examine the GLUT4 motifs responsible for the initial sorting of GLUT4 into and out of the GSC in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Specifically, we have found that the newly synthesized GLUT1 protein rapidly exits the secretory membrane system and accumulates at the plasma membrane in an insulin-independent manner. In contrast, GLUT4 accumulates in intracellular compartments without any appreciable concentration at the cell surface. Although insulin does induce a robust translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, this process takes 6–9 h following new synthesis and is consistent with a slow sorting step from the Golgi to the GSC (33Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Furukawa M. Hou J.C. Li L. Kanzaki M. Okada S. Kandror K.V. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2059-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Analysis of the time-dependent trafficking of GLUT4/GLUT1 loss-of-function chimeras demonstrated that both the amino terminus and the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 are necessary for the appropriate sorting and retention of the newly synthesized GLUT4 protein into the GSC. However, replacement of the carboxyl-terminal GLUT4 domain with GLUT1 had no significant effect. Previous studies have demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal domain, particularly the SLL and TELEYLGP motifs, is an important element in endocytosis and recycling to the GSC (15Shewan A.M. van Dam E.M. Martin S. Luen T.B. Hong W. Bryant N.J. James D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 973-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Martinez-Arca S. Lalioti V.S. Sandoval I.V. J.

J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, our data demonstrate that these motifs do not play a significant role in the initial entry into and exit from the GSC but are still consistent with a requirement for appropriate plasma membrane endocytosis and subsequent recycling back to the GSC. Gain-of-function chimeras, on the other hand, demonstrated that none of the individual cytoplasmic domains alone were able to fully recapitulate the sorting and insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. However, substitution of the GLUT4 amino terminus plus the large cytoplasmic loop generated a chimera that was functionally indistinguishable from the wild type GLUT4. These data directly demonstrate that GLUT4 contains multiple non-contiguous elements that either fold into a specific functional domain or direct several sorting events between the Golgi and the GSC, each utilizing distinct motifs. In either case, it is clear that the normal pattern of GLUT4 trafficking is a complex, multistep process with distinct sequence requirements for different steps in the transport process. Another important aspect of the present data is the analysis of newly synthesized GLUT4 trafficking when compared with previous studies using steady-state expression to identify GLUT4 trafficking motifs. Previous steady-state measurements have resulted in divergent conclusions and can now be reconciled depending on the specific assay system employed. For example, it was originally reported that the amino-terminal domain was necessary for GLUT4 intracellular sequestration, whereas subsequent studies found no evidence for the amino terminus but pointed to the carboxyl terminus. Consistent with our data, the analysis implicating the amino-terminal domain was performed using a viral expression system over a short period of time (6 h) (19Piper R.C. Tai C. Kulesza P. Pang S. Warnock D. Baenziger J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Puri C. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Piper R.C. Tai C. Slot J.W. Hahn C.S. Rice C.M. Huang H. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies implicating the carboxyl terminus either utilized steady-state expression or labeled only exofacially exposed GLUT4 (21Czech M.P. Chawla A. Woon C.W. Buxton J. Armoni M. Tang W. Joly M. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Verhey K.J. Hausdorff S.F. Birnbaum M.J. J.

Thus, the former studies were probably examining the initial sorting of the newly synthesized GLUT4 protein to the GSC, whereas the latter were primarily analyzing plasma membrane endocytosis and intracellular sorting back to the GSC. It has to be noted that these domains may also functionally overlap or supply redundant functions as the amino-terminal domain also plays a role in plasma membrane endocytosis (27Garippa R.J. Judge T.W. James D.E. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Al-Hasani H. Kunamneni R.K. Dawson K. Hinck C.S. Muller-Wieland D. Cushman S.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 131-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in agreement with our data, the transient transfection of primary adipocytes demonstrated that 4 h after transfection, the trafficking of the dileucine mutant (LL489/490AA) was identical to wild type GLUT4, whereas the amino-terminal F5A mutant had marked elevation of basal cell surface levels (36Al-Hasani H. Kunamneni R.K. Dawson K. Hinck C.S. Muller-Wieland D. Cushman S.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 131-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the amino terminus, the FQQI motif has received the most attention, and in steady-state measurements, mutation of this domain results in plasma membrane accumulation (19Piper R.C. Tai C. Kulesza P. Pang S. Warnock D. Baenziger J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Puri C. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Marsh B.J. Alm R.A. McIntosh S.R. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These data are also consistent with our findings that the G4A/F5A and I8A/G9A point mutants have a faster exit to the plasma membrane. Since these mutants also have a reduced rate of endocytosis, this contributes to the observed steady-state increase at the cell surface. We have also demonstrated for the first time that the large intracellular loop of GLUT4 is necessary to completely recapitulate initial GLUT4 trafficking. Although we have not yet mapped specific sites in the cytoplasmic loop, our data indicate that the region between amino acids 229–271 may be required, possibly at different steps of the sorting process of the newly synthesized GLUT4 between the Golgi and the GSC. Recently, it has been reported that TUG (tether, containing a UBX domain, for GLUT4) is a tethering protein responsible for intracellular sequestration of GLUT4 (37Bogan J.S. Hendon N. McKee A.E. Tsao T.S. Lodish H.F. Nature. 2003; 425: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The apparent binding site for TUG in GLUT4 is amino acids 263–273, which is partially included in the chimera 1–44B1 that partially displays restoration of wild type GLUT4 sorting. However, since the substitution of the amino terminus of GLUT4 and the second half of the loop into GLUT1 was not sufficient to completely recapitulate normal GLUT4 trafficking, the contribution of this or other non-contiguous motifs within the cytoplasmic loop of GLUT4 to this function needs further investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2059525103,"The stability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glycoprotein 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), the key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, is negatively regulated by sterols. HMGR is anchored in the ER via its N-terminal region, which spans the membrane eight times and contains a sterol-sensing domain. We have previously established that degradation of mammalian HMGR is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Ravid, T., Doolman, R., Avner, R., Harats, D., and Roitelman, J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 35840–35847). Here we expressed in HEK-293 cells an HA-tagged-truncated version of HMGR that encompasses all eight transmembrane spans (350 N-terminal residues). Similar to endogenous HMGR, degradation of this HMG350-3HA protein was accelerated by sterols, validating it as a model to study HMGR turnover. The degradation of HMG240-3HA, which lacks the last two transmembrane spans yet retains an intact sterol-sensing domain, was no longer accelerated by sterols. Using HMG350-3HA, we demonstrate that transmembrane region of HMGR is ubiquitinated in a sterol-regulated fashion. Through site-directed Lys → Arg mutagenesis, we pinpoint Lys248 and Lys89 as the internal lysines for ubiquitin attachment, with Lys248 serving as the major acceptor site for polyubiquitination. Moreover, the data indicate that the N terminus is also ubiquitinated. The degradation rates of the Lys → Arg mutants correlates with their level of ubiquitination. Notably, lysine-less HMG350-3HA is degraded faster than wild-type protein, suggesting that lysines other than Lys89 and Lys248 attenuate ubiquitination at the latter residues. The ATP-dependent ubiquitination of HMGR in isolated microsomes requires E1 as the sole cytosolic protein, indicating that ER-bound E2 and E3 enzymes catalyze this modification. Polyubiquitination of HMGR is correlated with its extraction from the ER membrane, a process likely to be assisted by cytosolic p97/VCP/Cdc48p-Ufd1-Npl4 complex, as only ubiquitinated HMGR pulls down p97.

The intracellular levels of HMGR are regulated by the cellular needs for sterol and nonsterol metabolites. This regulation involves changes in the transcription of the HMGR gene and, at the post-translational level, alteration of enzyme stability (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4517) Google Scholar, 2Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 3Hampton R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 345-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, when demands for sterols are high, HMGR gene is transcribed at a high rate, and the resulting HMGR protein is relatively stable. When the requirements for mevalonate-derived metabolites have been satisfied, transcription ceases, and the enzyme is rapidly degraded (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4517) Google Scholar, 2Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 3Hampton R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 345-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). HMGR gene transcription is controlled by specific factors, designated sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which bind to sterol regulatory elements in the promoter of the gene and activate transcription (1Goldstein J.L.

The nuclear SREBPs are derived from the N terminus of large endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-bound precursors through sequential cleavage by two Golgi proteases (5Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S.

In sterol-depleted cells, the membrane SREBP precursors are transported by vesicles to the Golgi where cleavage occurs. In this journey, the SREBP precursors are escorted by SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a polytopic ER protein with a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) in its membrane region, which associates with the C terminus of SREBPs precursors soon after their synthesis (6Hua X.

In sterol-replete cells, the SCAP·SREBP complex is retained in the ER through interaction of SCAP's SSD with resident ER membrane proteins, Insig-1 and Insig-2. This sterol-stimulated binding of SCAP to Insigs prevents SCAP·SREBP complex from reaching the compartment where the SREBP-cleaving proteases reside (9Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D.

Mutations in the SSD of SCAP disrupt its interaction with Insigs and allow the transport of the SCAP·SREBP complex from the ER to the Golgi even in the presence of sterols (11Yabe D. Xia Z.-P.

Mammalian HMGR is a “high mannose” resident glycoprotein of the ER (12Liscum L. Cummings R.D. Anderson R.G.W. DeMartino G.N. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The enzyme is composed of four 97-kDa subunits, each of which can be divided into a highly conserved C-terminal domain that faces the cytoplasm and constitute the catalytic site (14Istvan E.S. Palnitkar M. Buchanan S.K. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and an N-terminal hydrophobic domain that spans the ER membrane eight times (15Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr, W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and bears the single N-glycan (12Liscum L. Cummings R.D. Anderson R.G.W. DeMartino G.N.

Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) but operates as an independent “degron” that is necessary and sufficient to confer metabolically regulated stability onto HMGR as well as onto a variety of heterologous reporter proteins such as β-galactosidase in HM-Gal (17Skalnik D.G. Narita H. Kent C. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6836-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This transmembrane region of HMGR also contains an SSD that shares considerable homology with the SSD of SCAP (11Yabe D. Xia Z.-P. Adams C.M. Rawson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the majority of the short-lived proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which selectively conjugates polyubiquitin chain(s) to these proteins and marks them for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Ubiquitination of specific proteins is executed by distinct combinations of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) and ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). Initially, these enzymes attach the 8-kDa ubiquitin molecule to lysine residue(s) in the target protein, forming an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl group of the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and the ϵ-NH2 of that lysine in the target protein (18Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar, 19Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitin chains are subsequently formed through the processive addition of ubiquitin molecules such that the C terminus of each added ubiquitin unit is linked to a specific lysine residue (usually Lys48) in the previous ubiquitin moiety. However, it remains unclear whether and how the E2/E3 enzymes select specific lysine(s) to which the first ubiquitin in the polyubiquitin chain is conjugated. In addition to its role in the degradation of proteins in the cytosol and nucleoplasm, the ubiquitin-proteasome system also participates in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded or misassembled membrane and luminal proteins that fail to pass the scrutiny of the quality control of the ER (20Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Such aberrant proteins are dislocated back to the cytosol in a process that requires the activity of the cytosolic AAA-ATPase p97/VCP/Cdc48p-Ufd1-Npl4 complex and are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (21Ye Y.

Song C. Li C.-C.H. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We have previously established that the degradation of mammalian HMGR is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in what appears to be the metabolically regulated routing of HMGR into the constitutive ERAD pathway (29Ravid T. Doolman R. Avner R. Harats D. Roitelman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35840-35847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Since both HMGR and HMGal are polyubiquitinated under conditions that accelerate HMGR degradation, we hypothesized that ubiquitination occurs in their common transmembrane region. Here, we demonstrate that, indeed, HMGR is ubiquitinated at its membrane region and pinpoint lysines 89 and 248 as the polyubiquitin acceptor sites. Moreover, our data indicate that the N terminus of HMGR is also ubiquitinated. Polyubiquitination of HMGR appears to be carried out by ER E2 and E3 enzymes and facilitates the extraction of this polytopic protein from the membranes, probably with the aid of the cytosolic p97/VCP.

Unless otherwise noted, all other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Fetal bovine lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS, d ≥1.25) was prepared by ultracentrifugation, as described (30Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Cells—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells were grown in Medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Stable transfectants were selected in the same medium in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin, and then were routinely maintained in 250 μg/ml Geneticin. HMGR-overproducing LP-90 cells (31Ravid T.

UT2 cells (32Mosley S.T. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Cell Fractionation—Enriched ER membranes were prepared from LP-90 cells by centrifugation through discontinuous sucrose gradient, as described by McGee et al. (33McGee T.P. Cheng H.H. Kumagai H. Omura S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25630-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To prepare cytosolic fraction, washed UT-2 cells were swollen for 10 min by incubation on ice in hypotonic buffer (20 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2). The cells were collected in 0.5 ml of the hypotonic buffer that was supplemented with 250 mm sucrose and homogenized by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer followed by 20 passages through a 25-gauge needle. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) and the postnuclear supernatant was spun again (200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). The resulting supernatant is designated “cytosol.” Construction of HMG350-3HA, HMG240-3HA and Generation of Mutants—The sequence for triple HA epitope (3HA), with appended SmaI and NotI sites at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was amplified from pRH990 (kindly provided by R. Hampton) and ligated in-frame down-stream to an EcoRI-DraI-digested Syrian hamster HMGR cDNA (at residue 350). The resulting 1.2 kb HMG350-3HA cDNA was subcloned as an EcoRI-NotI fragment in pBlueScript. This plasmid was used for all subsequent mutageneses by the overlap extension method (34Ho S.N. Hunta H.D. Horton R.M. Pullena J.K. Peasea L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar), using high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega), the appropriate internal mutagenic primers (list of primers is available upon request), and the T3 and T7 primers of pBlueScript. Lysine-less HMG350-3HA was created by successive Lys → Arg mutagenesis of all 11 lysines within the wild-type construct. The triple HA epitope does not contain any lysines. To construct HMG240-3HA, HMGR cDNA was first cut at residue 241 with BstXI and the protruding 3′-overhang was blunted with Mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs). Following digestion with EcoRI, the blunt 3′-end of this 0.7 kb fragment was ligated upstream at the SmaI site of the above described 3HA epitope. The authenticity of all constructs and the presence of the desired mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. For mammalian expression, the wild-type and mutant cDNAs were cloned at the EcoRI-NotI sites of pIRESneo2 vector (Clontech) and plasmids were stably transfected into HEK-293 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—On day 1, 1.5 × 106 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes in Medium A. On day 2 the cells were re-fed with medium B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and supplemented with 10% (v/v) LPDS, 2 μm compactin, and 100 μm sodium mevalonate). On day 3, the cells were starved for 1 h in 1 ml of Medium C (methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) LPDS, 2 μm compactin and 100 μm MVA) and then pulse-labeled for 30 min with 100 μCi of Expre35S35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; >1000 Ci/mmol). Chase was commenced by aspirating the radioactive medium and addition of fresh Medium B that was supplemented with 2 mm unlabeled methionine and the indicated additions. At the designated time points, the cells were lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies and immobilized protein A, as described (29Ravid T. Doolman R. Avner R. Harats D. Roitelman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35840-35847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by 5–15% SDS-PAGE, and gels were quantified using Cyclone phosphorimager and Optiquant software package (Packard). For immunoblotting analyses, after cell lysis and estimation of protein content, samples containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Optitran BAS-83 reinforced nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell; Germany). The membranes were probed with the primary antibodies detailed below, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). HRP was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. Endogenous HMGR and HMG350-3HA were immunoprecipitated with specific antiserum directed against the membrane domain of HMGR (15Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr, W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HMG350-3HA and HMG240-3HA were precipitated with anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5; Roche Applied Science). HMGR was immunoblotted with the A9 monoclonal antibody (36Liscum L. Luskey K.L. Chin D.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8450-8455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For ubiquitination and pull-down assays, HMG350-3HA was first immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA-agarose (immobilized anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody 3F10; Roche Applied Science), and then immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies against ubiquitin (clone P4D1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HA (clone 12CA5), and p97 (clone 58.13.3; Progen Biotechnik, Germany), all followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies. To identify the site(s) in HMGR to which ubiquitin is conjugated in a metabolically regulated fashion, we focused on its transmembrane region, which also allowed us to minimize the number of lysines that are potentially modified. For this purpose, we constructed truncated versions of HMGR that consist of the 350 or 240 N-terminal residues of the enzyme, each tagged with 3 copies of the HA epitope, as shown in Fig. 1A. This scheme illustrates the current model for the secondary structure of the HMGR transmembrane region. Previous studies, including in vitro translation and membrane translocation experiments, in vivo analysis of HMGal constructs with engineered N-glycosylation sites and direct immunological examination with anti-peptides antibodies, indicated that this region consists of eight transmembrane spans separated by three cytosolic and four luminal loops (15Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr, W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 37Olender E.H. Simon R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4223-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, the boundaries of these spans have not been precisely determined. Fig. 1B shows that stable transfection of pIRES-HMG350-3HA led to the expression of a protein doublet of ∼44kDa that was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the membrane domain of HMGR as well as with an anti-HA antibody (see below). This doublet represents the non-glycosylated (lower band) and N-glycosylated (upper band) forms of HMG350-3HA, as indicated by digestion with endoglycosidase H. This treatment increased the electrophoretic mobility of the upper band such that it co-migrated with the lower band, which was not affected by this treatment (data not shown). Importantly, although the turnover rate of HMG350-3HA in sterol-depleted cells was significantly faster than that of endogenous HMGR (t½ 3.4 h versus ∼12 h, respectively; see also Ref. 38Cheng H.H. Xu L. Kumagai H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17171-17178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), its degradation was markedly accelerated upon addition of sterols to the cells (see Table I), similarly to the effect of sterols on the degradation of native HMGR. Moreover, like endogenous HMGR, degradation of HMG350-3HA was inhibited by MG-132 (data not shown; see also Fig. 3A), indicating that this degradation was also mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Fig. 1C shows that the truncated mutant HMG240-3HA, which includes the entire putative SSD of the reductase, was degraded with a half-life similar to that of HMG350-3HA (3.4 h). Nonetheless, this process was no longer regulated by sterols. Thus, the 350 N-terminal residues of HMGR that encompass all eight transmembrane spans are necessary and sufficient to endow metabolically-regulated turnover, making the HMG350-3HA a bona fide model to study the intracellular fate of HMGR.Table IHalf-life of HMG350-3HA mutantsConstructHalf-life-Fold change- Sterols+ SterolshWild-type3.491.831.91K89R3.602.881.25K248R3.892.821.38K89R/K248R4.864.141.18K89R/K248R/R240K3.852.491.55No Lys3.202.891.11Lys892.181.921.14Lys2481.781.051.70Lys89/ 2481.550.801.95R7K2.482.990.83R84K2.032.050.99R154K2.062.240.92R240K1.701.501.14 Open table in a new tab According to the model in Fig. 1A, among the 11 lysines and the N terminus that may potentially serve as ubiquitin acceptor sites in HMG350-3HA, only Lys89, Lys248, and the N terminus face the cytosol and are therefore readily accessible to the ubiquitination machinery at the cytosolic face of the ER membrane. We replaced these lysine residues with arginines and examined by pulse-chase experiments whether these mutations affected the regulated turnover of HMG350-3HA. The results are shown in Fig. 2 and the calculated half-lives of the different mutants are summarized in Table I. In the absence of sterols, the degradation of the K89R mutant was similar to that of wild-type (WT) HMG350-3HA (Table I; compare lanes 1–5 in Fig. 2, b and a). However, in the presence of sterols the degradation of K89R was noticeably attenuated relative to the wild-type HMG350-3HA (lanes 5–9 in Fig. 2, b and a). The K248R mutant was degraded slightly slower in the absence of sterols (Table I; Fig. 2c, lanes 1–5), but similarly to K89R in sterol-treated cells (Table I; Fig. 2c, lanes 5–9). Substituting both lysines (K89+248R; Fig. 2d) resulted in a much more pronounced effect in the absence of sterols (Fig. 2d, lanes 1–5, and Table I) and nearly abolished the sterol-accelerated degradation of this mutant (Fig. 2d, lanes 5–9 and Table I). Replacements with arginines of other lysines in the transmembrane region of HMG350-3HA, which are assumed to be buried within the lipid bilayer (such as Lys142 or Lys336; see Fig. 1A), had no appreciable effect on the rate of degradation, either in the absence or presence of sterols (data not shown). Thus, it appears that both Lys89 and Lys248 are necessary to confer sterol-regulated turnover of HMGR. To examine whether Lys89 and Lys248 were also sufficient for regulation of HMGR degradation, we generated a mutant of HMG350-3HA in which all 11 lysines were substituted, as well as versions in which only Lys89 or Lys248 or both lysines were preserved (Fig. 2, e–h and Table I). Relative to the wild-type protein, the lysine-less version of HMG350-3HA (No Lys; e) was degraded significantly faster in the absence of sterols. Nevertheless, sterols did not accelerate the turnover of this mutant (Fig. 2e). Preserving the lysine at position 89 did not significantly alter the degradation of this protein relative to the lysine-less HMG350-3HA in the absence or presence of sterols (Fig. 2e, lanes 10–18 and Table I). The phenotype of the preserved lysine at position 248 was much more pronounced than that of Lys89; not only was this HMG350-3HAK248 protein eliminated faster in the absence of sterols, but its degradation was also markedly hastened in the presence of sterols (Fig. 2g and Table I). Fig. 2h shows that, in the absence of sterols, the degradation of HMG350-3HA in which both Lys89 and Lys248 were preserved was more rapid than that of HMG350-3HAK248 (Table I). Moreover, upon addition of sterols, this HMG350-3HAK89+K248 mutant was degraded even faster, fully restoring the extent of sterol-accelerated degradation observed with the wild-type protein (Table I). Taken together, these results demonstrate that either Lys89 or Lys248 are singly sufficient to permit regulated degradation of HMGR. Moreover, it appears that the effects of these residues are additive such that maximal degree of regulation by sterols is the sum of contributions of each lysine, with Lys248 playing a more prominent role than Lys89 in endowing sterol-regulated turnover onto the transmembrane region of HMGR. To correlate between the degradation phenotype of the various mutants and their state of polyubiquitination, we immunoprecipitated the different HMG350-3HA proteins and immunoblotted them sequentially with an anti-ubiquitin antibody followed by an anti-HA antibody. A representative blot is shown in Fig. 3A. In untreated cells (Fig. 3A"
https://openalex.org/W1974994136,"Pal amidase, encoded by pneumococcal bacteriophage Dp-1, represents one step beyond in the modular evolution of pneumococcal murein hydrolases. It exhibits the choline-binding module attaching pneumococcal lysins to the cell wall, but the catalytic module is different from those present in the amidases coded by the host or other pneumococcal phages. Pal is also an effective antimicrobial agent against Streptococcus pneumoniae that may constitute an alternative to antibiotic prophylaxis. The structural implications of Pal singular structure and their effect on the choline-amidase interactions have been examined by means of several techniques. Pal stability is maximum around pH 8.0 (Tm approximately 50.2 degrees C; DeltaHt = 183 +/- 4 kcal mol(-1)), and its constituting modules fold as two tight interacting cooperative units whose denaturation merges into a single process in the free amidase but may proceed as two well resolved events in the choline-bound state. Choline titration curves reflect low energy ligand-protein interactions and are compatible with two sets of sites. Choline binding strongly stabilizes the cell wall binding module, and the conformational stabilization is transmitted to the catalytic region. Moreover, the high proportion of aggregates formed by the unbound amidase together with choline preferential interaction with Pal dimers suggest the existence of marginally stable regions that would become stabilized through choline-protein interactions without significantly modifying Pal secondary structure. This structural rearrangement may underlie in vitro conversion of Pal from the low to the full activity form triggered by choline. The Pal catalytic module secondary structure could denote folding conservation within pneumococcal lytic amidases, but the number of functional choline binding sites is reduced (2-3 sites per monomer) when compared with pneumococcal LytA amidase (4-5 sites per monomer) and displays different intermodular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2022253491,"Activation of Ca2+-dependent Cl- currents (ICl(Ca)) increases membrane excitability in vascular smooth muscle cells. Previous studies showed that Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation suppresses ICl(Ca) in pulmonary artery myocytes, and the aim of the present study was to determine the role of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin on chloride channel activity. Immunocytochemical and Western blot studies with isoform-specific antibodies revealed that the α and β forms of the CaN catalytic subunit are expressed in PA cells but that only the α variant translocated to the cell periphery upon a rise in intracellular [Ca2+]. ICl(Ca) evoked by pipette solutions containing a [Ca2+] set at 500 nm was considerably larger when the pipette solution included constitutively active CaN containing the α catalytic isoform. This stimulatory effect was lost by boiling the enzyme or by the inclusion of a specific CaN inhibitory peptide and was not shared by the inclusion of the β form of the catalytic subunit. In the absence of constitutively active CaN, cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of CaN, suppressed ICl(Ca) evoked by 500 nm Ca2+ when the current amplitude was relatively large but was ineffective in cells with smaller currents. In perforated patch recordings, cyclosporin A consistently inhibited ICl(Ca) evoked as a consequence of Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels. These novel data show that in PA myocytes activation of ICl(Ca) is enhanced by Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation and that the regulation of this conductance is highly isoform-specific.

Smooth muscle cells actively accumulate chloride resulting in an equilibrium potential ∼30 mV less negative than the resting membrane potential (1Chipperfield A.R. Harper A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

In all of the smooth muscle cells, the generation of ICl(Ca) has an obligatory requirement for increased intracellular [Ca2+] with a threshold of ∼200 nm (4Pacaud P. Loirand G. Grégoire G.

However, in tracheal and arterial smooth muscle cells, the activation of ICl(Ca) was augmented by inhibitors of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, (5Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These data revealed an inhibition of channel activity contemporaneously with the generation of the current. However, these studies did not take into account other possible Ca2+-dependent pathways. The aim of the present study was to assess whether ICl(Ca) activity in rabbit pulmonary artery (PA) myocytes is also influenced by Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation. Calcineurin (CaN) is a heterodimeric serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is involved in a number of cellular responses (7Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X.T. J. Biol.

CaN is composed of a catalytic subunit (CaNA) that is activated by Ca2+ binding to its regulatory subunit (CaNB) and by the binding of the Ca2+/calmodulin complex (Ca2+/CaM). The catalytic subunit of calcineurin (CaNA) exists in three distinct isoforms (α, β, and γ), each encoded by a separate gene, and isoform-specific substrates have been identified (10Perrino B.A. Wilson A.J. Ellison P. Clapp L.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3540-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis indicated that the α and β isoforms are expressed in pulmonary arteries but that only the CaNA-α isoform translocates from the cytosol to the membrane following an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Intracellular dialysis with constitutively active CaNA-α produced a large enhancement of ICl(Ca) elicited by 500 nm Ca2+-containing pipette solutions that was attenuated by the co-dialysis with a peptide inhibitor of CaN. In comparison, CaNA-β had no stimulatory effect on ICl(Ca) in PA myocytes. Consequently, through the use of recombinant calcineurin, we show that the regulation of ICl(Ca) by this phosphatase is highly dependent on the calcineurin isoform. This study, in association with our earlier work with CaN inhibitors in coronary artery smooth muscle cells (11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), reveals the crucial influence of calcineurin on calcium-activated chloride channels and highlights the complex pathways that govern Ca2+-dependent Cl- activity in vascular myocytes. Single Cell Electrophysiology—Cells were prepared from the main and second branch pulmonary arteries isolated from New Zealand White rabbits (2-3 kg) as described previously (6Greenwood I. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Piper A.S. Greenwood I.A. Large W.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 593: 117-131Google Scholar, 13Piper A.S Greenwood I.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After isolation, cell were stored in a low Ca2+-physiological salt solution at 4 °C and used within 6 h. The composition of the modified physiological salt solution was as follows: NaCl (120 mm); NaHCO3 (25 mm) (pH 7.4 after bubbling with 95% O2, 5% CO2 gas); KCl (4.2 mm); KH2PO4 (1.2 mm); MgCl2 (1.2 mm); CaCl2 (0.05 mm); and glucose (11 mm). ICl(Ca) were recorded predominantly in the whole-cell voltage clamp mode and were evoked directly by pipette solutions containing free Ca2+ set at 500 nm. For experiments in which ICl(Ca) was elicited by 500 nm Ca2+, the external solution contained: NaCl (126 mm); Hepes-NaOH (10 mm), pH 7.4; glucose (20 mm); CaCl2 (1.8 mm); MgCl2 (1.2 mm); and tetraethylammonium chloride (10 mm). The pipette solution contained: tetraethylammonium chloride (20 mm); CsCl (106 mm); Hepes (5 mm); BAPTA (10 mm); MgATP (3 mm); GTP (0.2 mm); and MgCl2 (0.42 mm) and pH was set to 7.2 by the addition of CsOH. Free [Ca2+] was set by adding an appropriate amount of CaCl2 (7.3 mm) determined by the EQCAL buffer program (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO) and was independently verified using a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (Thermo Orion, Model 93-20, Beverly, MA) and calibrated Ca2+ solutions available from a commercial source (World Precision Instruments, Inc., CALBUF-2, Sarasota, FL). Sustained Ca2+-activated Cl- currents generated by this technique have been characterized fully in previous studies (6Greenwood I. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Piper A.S. Greenwood I.A. Large W.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 593: 117-131Google Scholar). The main voltage step protocol used in these experiments was the same as that used in earlier studies to characterize ICl(Ca). In the perforated patch experiments, the pipette solution contained CsCl (126 mm), Hepes (5 mm), EGTA (5 mm), amphotericin (300 μg ml-1 from a 60 mg ml-1 stock in dimethyl sulfoxide), and pH set to 7.2 by the addition of CsOH. For those experiments, the external solution was identical to that used in experiments in which ICl(Ca) was evoked by 500 nm Ca2+ as described above. All of the enzymes, MgATP, BAPTA, ionomycin, and ML-7, were purchased from Sigma. Cyclosporin A was purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), and calcineurin inhibitory peptide (CaN-AIP) was from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Synthesis of Constitutively Active Calcineurin—Constitutively active calcineurin isoforms were created by introducing stop codons into the cDNA for the catalytic subunit, CaNA, causing the translated CaNA subunits to truncate immediately C-terminal of the CaM-binding domain and delete the auto-inhibitory domain. All methodologies for cDNA manipulation, baculovirus screening, and purification of CaN using monolayer cultures of Sf21 cells have been described previously (7Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Perrino B.A. Wilson A.J. Ellison P. Clapp L.H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15965-15969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Imaging—The immunocytochemical detection of CaN isoforms in single PA myocytes was performed as described for coronary artery myocytes by Ledoux et al. (11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using polyclonal goat anti-calcineurin A-α and A-β antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) both at a dilution of 1:50. These antibodies are reported by Santa Cruz Biotechnology to recognize a C-terminal epitope in human, rat, and mouse CaNA-α or CaNA-β, respectively. However, the amino acid sequences of rabbit CaNA-α (GenBank™ accession number AAN23152) and CaNA-β (GenBank™ accession number AAN23153) are identical to the human CaNA-α and CaNA-β amino acid sequences, so it is very possible that these antibodies specifically recognized rabbit CaNA-α and CaNA-β in our experiments. Cells were imaged at rest and after stimulation with ionomycin and 500 nm Ca2+ to raise intracellular [Ca2+] and create an internal environment similar to the conditions of the electrophysiological experiments. Contraction of the myocytes was prevented by incubation with the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, ML-7 (3 μm). The primary antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% normal donkey serum and 0.04% Triton X-100. Negative control experiments were performed by repeating the above steps in the absence of primary antibodies. Coverslips containing the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to a Cy5-coupled anti-mouse antibody (Alexa 647; Molecular Probes) and a TRITC-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Alexa 546; Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:400 for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. Solutions of both secondary antibodies were prepared in goat and diluted in 1% normal donkey serum and 0.04% Triton X-100 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). The bar graphs shown in Fig. 2, C and D, are the mean ± S.E. ratio of membrane/cytosol fluorescence intensity for CaNA-α and CaNA-β taken from a cross-sectional line scan of an arbitrary region of the cell located outside the nuclear region. Fluorescence intensity of ∼5-10 pixels wide on the two sides of the membrane spanned by the line scan was averaged and normalized to averaged fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm. Western Blot Analysis of Rabbit Pulmonary Artery Smooth Muscle—50 μg of protein from the 1000 × g supernatant of homogenized rabbit PA smooth muscle was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose sheets. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using bovine γ-globulin as standard. The blots were probed with Santa Cruz Biotechnology goat anti-CaNA-α or goat anti-CaNA-β antibodies (1:10,000 dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:50,000 dilution) antibodies. Immunodetection was carried using ECL Advance from Amersham Biosciences, and the TIFF images were collected with a CCD camera imaging system (Labworks, UVP Inc.). Densitometry was carried out using Un-Scan-It (Silk Scientific). Statistics—All of the data are the mean ± S.E. of n cells from at least two different animals. Significance was taken with p values below 0.05. Endogenous Expression of Distinct Isoforms of Calcineurin A—Western blot analysis was performed using tissue lysates derived from endothelium-denuded pulmonary arteries. Antibodies selective for CaNA-α and CaNA-β revealed that both isoforms were expressed, and a comparison with purified CaN standards showed that ∼0.56 μg of CaNA-α and 0.3 μg of CaNA-β were present (Fig. 1). Consequently, PA smooth muscle expresses both the α and β variants of CaNA but the α appears to be slightly more abundant. The use of a CaN antibody that was nonspecific for these isoforms revealed that this enzyme translocated to the membrane of coronary artery myocytes upon a rise of intracellular [Ca2+] (11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We used antibodies that were specific for the α and β isoforms of CaNA to examine the cellular distribution of the individual isoforms in freshly dissociated PA myocytes under resting conditions and after raising intracellular [Ca2+]. Under control conditions, both isoforms appeared evenly distributed between the cytosol and membrane (Fig. 2A). After the cells were exposed to a medium containing 80 nm ionomycin, 3 μm ML-7 (to inhibit myosin light chain kinase and thus contraction; see Ref. 11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and 500 nm Ca2+ designed to raise [Ca2+]i, CaNA-α translocated toward the plasma membrane, whereas CaNA-β remained for the most part distributed homogenously throughout the cytoplasm and membrane (Fig. 2A). Consequently, the ratio of optical density of immunofluorescence intensity for CaNA-α labeling at the membrane over cytosol was ∼2.5 regardless of whether the immunodetection involved single (Fig. 2C) or dual (Fig. 2D) antibody experiments. The preferential localization of CaNA-α was not observed when the extracellular solution did not contain Ca2+. These results reveal that in PA cells CaN translocation in response to an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration is isoform-specific. Effect of CaN Inhibition on Ca2+-activated Cl- Channels in PA Myocytes—The influence of endogenous CaN-mediated dephosphorylation on ICl(Ca) was investigated using the CaN-specific blocker, cyclosporin A (CsA), which is a neutral lipophilic cyclic undecapeptide that binds to cyclophilin A to form a complex that suppresses CaN activity by interfering with the active site of the catalytic domain (8Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 9Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Initial experiments were performed using the perforated patch variant of the whole-cell recording configuration, and ICl(Ca) was elicited by promoting Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels as characterized in previous studies on various types of smooth muscle cell (e.g.15Akbarali H.I. Giles W.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 460: 117-133Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Greenwood I.A Large W.A. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Lamb F.S. Volk K.A. Shibata E.F. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Calcium channels were opened by depolarization from the holding potential of -60 mV, and ICl(Ca) was manifest as an outward current at test potentials positive to the theoretical chloride equilibrium (∼0 mV) and as a slowly declining inward current upon repolarization to the holding potential (Fig. 4A). The application of 2 μm CsA for 180 s had a small insignificant effect (p = 0.09) on the voltage-gated calcium current at +10 mV (Fig. 3, A and B) but produced a 39 ± 10% inhibition of the inward Cl- tail current at -60 mV (n = 5; p = 0.006, Fig. 3C) that was associated with an increase in its rate of decay (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3Effects of CsA on ICl(Ca) recorded using the perforated patch recording configuration. Panel A shows currents recorded in the perforated patch configuration and evoked by step depolarization from -60 mV to +10 mV in the absence or presence of 2 μm CsA. This generated a rapidly activating dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ current (ICa(L)) and a slowly declining ICl(Ca) upon repolarization to -60 mV. Scalars represent 100 ms and 50 pA. The mean effects of CsA on the amplitude of ICa(L) at +10 mV and the magnitude of inward ICl(Ca) tail current and its rate of decay at -60 mV are shown in panels B-D. In panel C, the tail current was measured as the amplitude of the current obtained by extrapolating an exponential fit to time = 0 after return to -60 mV. Data are the mean of five cells from four animals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To isolate an effect of CsA on CaN-mediated dephosphorylation of the underlying Cl- channel as opposed to possible effects on the voltage-dependent calcium channels or Ca2+-homeostatic mechanisms, experiments were performed where ICl(Ca) was evoked directly by pipette solutions containing 500 nm Ca2+ and 3 mm ATP. With this pipette solution, the rupture of the cell membrane in PA myocytes to achieve whole-cell mode resulted in a large inward current at the holding potential of -50 mV and the generation of time-dependent outward relaxations following depolarization to +70 mV (Fig. 4). Under the ionic conditions used, these currents represent sustained ICl(Ca) that have been characterized extensively in vascular smooth muscle cells including PA myocytes (6Greenwood I. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Piper A.S. Greenwood I.A. Large W.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 593: 117-131Google Scholar, 13Piper A.S Greenwood I.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 138: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In accord with previous observations (12Piper A.S. Greenwood I.A. Large W.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 593: 117-131Google Scholar), the amplitude of ICl(Ca) at -50 mV declined progressively to a steady-state level over ∼2 min following rupture that was associated with a reduction in the amplitude of the outward relaxation at +70 mV (Fig. 4, A and B). Following the initial period of rundown, the amplitude of ICl(Ca) remained at a constant level ∼20% of the initial amplitude for the remainder of the experiment. Currents were elicited in cells bathed in normal external solution and alternated with cells incubated in 2 μm CsA for 10 min before rupturing the membrane seal to gain whole-cell access. Incubation of cells in CsA significantly attenuated the amplitude of ICl(Ca) generated by 6 min of cell dialysis with 500 nm Ca2+ in seven cells from three animals (Fig. 4D), and the mean late current at +70 mV was 501 ± 70 and 263 ± 51 pA in the absence and presence of CsA (p = 0.043). In an additional study, CsA had no apparent effect on the amplitude of ICl(Ca) (Fig. 4E). However, in these cells, the control current was significantly smaller (see Fig. 4F) that was associated with a more prominent rundown of ICl(Ca) upon membrane rupture. These data show that CsA was able to inhibit sustained ICl(Ca), and the effectiveness of this agent was proportional to the amplitude of the control currents. Overall, these experiments show that the suppression of endogenous CaN by CsA diminishes the amplitude of ICl(Ca) in PA smooth muscle cells but also suggest that CaN is particularly labile in the whole-cell configuration resulting in variable effects of the phosphatase inhibitor. Effect of Dialysis with Constitutively Active Forms of CaN—To circumvent any variable influence due to endogenous CaN and to shift the cellular status in favor of dephosphorylation, we undertook experiments using pipette solutions enriched with constitutively active recombinant CaN isoforms. The inclusion of CaNA-α in a pipette solution containing 500 nm Ca2+ attenuated the initial rundown observed upon rupture of the cell membrane (Fig. 5A), and this was followed by a progressive enhancement of current amplitude over the next 20 min. Consequently, intracellular dialysis with CaNA-α augmented considerably the amplitude of ICl(Ca) (Fig. 5, B and C). After a 6-min recording, the mean current at the end of a step to +90 mV was 17 ± 5 and 47 ± 8 pA pF-1 in the absence and presence of 500 nm CaNA-α, respectively (n = 8 and 6). The increase in ICl(Ca) amplitude was associated with an increase in the rate of current activation at positive potentials and a slowing of current decline at -80 mV (Fig. 5D). The inclusion of CaNA-α that had been boiled for 15 min to reduce enzyme activity failed to increase ICl(Ca) (mean current at +90 mV after a 2-min recording time was 16 ± 6 pA pF-1 compared with 7.4 ± 2 pA pF-1 under control conditions; Fig. 5C). Similar to previous studies (6Greenwood I. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Piper A.S. Greenwood I.A. Large W.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 593: 117-131Google Scholar), currents evoked by 500 nm Ca2+ in the absence and presence of CaNA-α reversed (Erev) close to the theoretical chloride equilibrium potential (+2 mV) at +6 ± 2 and +6 ± 1 mV (n = 4), respectively. Replacement of external NaCl with sodium thiocyanate shifted Erev to -40 ± 1 and -42 ± 5 mV, respectively (Fig. 6). These data show that the large current recorded in the presence of CaNA-α was not due to the de novo activation of a contaminating current but was due to an enhanced activation of ICl(Ca). The stimulatory effects of CaNA-α were abolished by co-dialysis with CaN-AIP (Fig. 7A), a peptide inhibitor of CaN that mimics the auto-inhibitory domain (6Greenwood I. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Perrino B.A. Wilson A.J. Ellison P. Clapp L.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3540-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In these experiments, ICl(Ca) at +90 mV with CaNA-α alone was 68 ± 14 pA pF-1 (n = 6), but in combination with 100 μm CaN-AIP, the mean current at +90 mV was 19 ± 4 pA pF-1 (n = 5). In contrast to the striking data with CaNA-α, the β isoform failed to enhance ICl(Ca). In these experiments, a pipette solution containing 500 nm CaNA-α was alternated with one containing 500 nm CaNA-β and the mean ICl(Ca) values at +90 mV were 56 ± 11 and 15 ± 4 pA pF-1, respectively (n = 9 both groups, Fig. 7B). These data not only reveal a high degree of isoform specificity but also show that the stimulation produced by CaNA-α was not the result of a nonspecific effect due to the cell dialysis of a foreign protein. This point was supported by the observation that CaNA-α did not enhance currents evoked by pipette solutions containing 10 mm BAPTA with no added Ca2+ (effectively zero Ca2+, Fig. 7D). These experiments also reveal that CaN-dependent dephosphorylation “alone” cannot stimulate ICl(Ca) and establish that CaN is a crucial regulator of Cl- channel activity but is “not” the impetus for channel activation. The findings of the present study reveal CaN to be an important regulator of ICl(Ca) in PA smooth muscle cells and demonstrate that the modulation of the underlying channels is mediated solely by CaNA-α. Our data show that the inhibition of endogenous CaN with the specific agent, cyclosporin A, reduced the amplitude of ICl(Ca) evoked either directly by pipette solutions containing 500 nm Ca2+ or as a consequence of Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. These data are consistent with our previous observation in coronary cells that endogenous CaN is an important regulator of ICl(Ca) in vascular smooth muscle cells (11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The enrichment of the pipette solution with a constitutively active form of CaNA-α augmented markedly the amplitude of ICl(Ca) allied with a considerable change in the voltage-dependent kinetics. Remarkably, this effect was not shared by the β isoform of CaNA, although Western blot analysis revealed that both α and β isoforms are expressed at significant levels in the PA. Consistent with a specific role of CaNA-α for regulating ICl(Ca) in PA cells was the observation that this isoform translocated toward the plasma membrane following elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, a property not shared by CaNA-β. Specific Regulation of ICl(Ca) by CaNA-α in Pulmonary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells—CaN-dependent dephosphorylation influences a number of cellular processes including the regulation of transcription factors, synaptic vesicle recycling, and cardiac muscle hypertrophy (8Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 9Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). CaN has also been shown to modulate a number of cation channels including voltage-dependent and ATP-sensitive K+ channels in smooth muscle cells (18Wilson A.J. Jabr R.I. Clapp L.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Amberg G.C. Koh S.D. Perrino B.A. Hatton W.J. Sanders K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C2020-C2028Crossref Google Scholar), but data on Cl- channels are sparse. Recently, we reported that inhibitors of CaN reduced the amplitude of ICl(Ca) in coronary artery myocytes in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that these agents decreased the apparent binding affinity of the Cl- channel for Ca2+ (11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This study shows that the CaN inhibitor CsA reduces the amplitude of ICl(Ca) in PA cells activated as a consequence of Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels or evoked directly by pipette solutions containing 500 nm free Ca2+. Moreover, CsA was observed to be relatively ineffective on currents recorded from cells where the control currents were relatively small. These data suggest that the activity of CaN may vary among populations of myocytes but that the level of activity appears to be a crucial determinant of Cl- current amplitude. Taken together with our previous findings with CaMKII inhibitors (6Greenwood I. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in PA cells, these results implicate a contemporaneous modulation of the channel protein or a closely associated regulatory subunit by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms. A similar contra-parallel regulation also exists in coronary artery smooth muscle cells, but there seems to be differences in Ca2+ sensitivity that probably reflect a tissue-specific pattern of expression of the kinases and phosphatases regulating ICl(Ca). Consistent with this idea, CaMKII inhibition stimulates ICl(Ca) evoked by 500 nm Ca2+ in PA cells but has no effect on this current in coronary artery cells (6Greenwood I. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), although effects are observed when the channel is stimulated by 1 μm free Ca2+ (11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, peptide and inorganic inhibitors of CaN consistently inhibited ICl(Ca) elicited by 500 nm Ca2+ in coronary artery myocytes (11Ledoux J. Greenwood I.A. Villeneuve L. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Consequently, CaN-mediated dephosphorylation in PA myocytes may be subjugated by an overwhelming activity of CaMKII (and perhaps other kinases). The rundown of ICl(Ca) activity seen in PA cells following activation is likely to reflect a change in the kinase/phosphatase balance in the vicinity of the channel. This hypothesis was corroborated by the use of constitutively active CaN. It is worth stressing that in perforated patch experiments CsA consistently suppressed inward tail ICl(Ca) and altered deactivation kinetics without influencing peak ICa(L) significantly. These data lend support to the notion that ICl(Ca) may be physiologically regulated by CaN in conditions minimizing intracellular dialysis and infer that CaN may have a relatively greater impact on ICl(Ca) regulation when the stimulating rise in [Ca2+]i is transient. Under these conditions, the activation of both CaMKII and CaN by Ca2+/CaM would be less than that observed with a sustained rise in [Ca2+]i; however, as CaN has a greater Ca2+ sensitivity than CaMKII (8Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 20Abraham S.T. Benscoter H. Schworer C.M. Singer H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2506-2513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the influence of the phosphatase is likely to dominate. Unique Regulation of ICl(Ca) by Calcineurin A-α—One novel finding of our study was the isoform-specific enhancement of ICl(Ca) produced by the inclusion of a constitutively active form of CaN. Whereas both CaNA-α and CaNA-β were shown to be expressed in pulmonary arteries, only intracellular dialysis with CaNA-α modulated ICl(Ca), although the α and β forms of the catalytic A domain are 81% identical at the amino acid level (21Guerni D. Klee P. Adv. Protein Phosphatase. 1991; 6: 391-410Google Scholar) and have a similar Ca2+ dependence. Co-application of CaNA-α with a peptide fragment analogous to the auto-inhibitory domain confirmed that the effects of CaNA-α were due to a specific phosphatase action. Moreover, immunocytochemical experiments revealed that only endogenous CaNA-α, but not CaNA-β, translocated toward the membrane under conditions mimicking our patch clamp experiments with internal Ca2+ clamped at 500 nm. CaN heterodimers containing CaNA-α and CaNA-β catalytic subunits exhibit a similar Ca2+ dependence, as this is conferred by the B subunit, but display different substrate affinities and catalytic activities in vitro (10Perrino B.A. Wilson A.J. Ellison P. Clapp L.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3540-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, trans-genetic approaches have revealed specific functions for the CaNA isoforms. For example, CaNA-β is required for T-cell proliferation as well as cardiac hypertrophy (22Bueno O.F. Brandt E.B. Rothenberg M.E. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9398-9403Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Tymitz K.M. Glascock B.J. Kimball T.F. Lorenz J.N. Molkentin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), whereas CaNA-α(-/-) mice display hyperphosphorylated τ-proteins in the brain and altered post-synaptic de-potentiation in the hippocampus (24Kayyali U.S. Zhang W. Yee A.G. Seidman J.G. Potter H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1668-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Zhuo M. Zhang W. Son H. Mansuy I. Sobel R.A Seidman J. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4650-4655Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This study is the first to show isoform-selective effects on a native ion channel and suggest that the expression of the α isoform of CaNA is the crucial determinant of the phosphorylation status of the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel. Consequently, the relative expression of CaNA-α or differences in the α:β ratio of CaN heterodimers between different vascular smooth muscle tissues would be expected to alter the level of ICl(Ca) regulation by this phosphatase. This exquisite property allows the regulation of ICl(Ca) by CaN to be fine-tuned by the cell through alterations in the composition of CaN heterodimers. Moreover, the inability of CsA to suppress ICl(Ca) when the control amplitude was relatively small suggests strongly that the generation of ICl(Ca) was reliant upon the level of CaN activity. The precise mechanism conferring specificity of CaNA-α on ICl(Ca) cannot be deduced from our data and will require further investigation. Fig. 8A shows the basic features of the structural domains of CaN and the percentage of amino acid sequence identity of the rat brain α and β isoforms (26Kuno T. Takeda T. Hirai M. Ito A. Mukai H. Tanaka C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The greatest sequence divergence between these two isoforms is observed at the N and C termini (<30%) and to a lesser extent at the Linker I region (60%). An interesting characteristic of the β isoform is the presence of 10 proline residues at the N terminus, a sequence not shared by the α isoform (Fig. 8B). Such a sequence could make this domain a target of interacting proteins, which could obstruct or limit access of the phosphatase to the target protein. Future studies will be undertaken to compare the effects of various chimeric constructs of the two isoforms on the anion current. As yet, the molecular nature of the protein underlying ICl(Ca) remains undefined (27Britton F. Ohya S. Horowitz B. Greenwood I.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 107-117Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and therefore precise information as to how dephosphorylation heightens ICl(Ca) activity can only be speculated. Our data show unequivocally that Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation does not gate the opening of the Cl- channel by a rise in [Ca2+]i as CaNA-α failed to generate ICl(Ca) when the internal solution contained 10 mm BAPTA only (i.e. pipette [Ca2+] was in the low nanomolar range). The channel properties underlying the kinetics of ICl(Ca) elicited by the technique used in this study have been characterized in non-muscle cells (28Arreola J. Melvin J.E. Begenisich T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 29Kuruma A. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 59-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The voltage-dependent outward relaxation reflects an increase in open probability due to an increase in the binding affinity for Ca2+ and a slower rate of channel closure, whereas the exponentially declining inward current at negative potentials is a simple approximation of the channel deactivation. As CaNA-α increased the rate of activation at positive potentials and slowed that rate of decay at negative potentials, these observations suggest that the removal of phosphate groups either increases the apparent binding affinity or slows the rate of channel closure. These questions will be addressed in future experiments. This study shows that CaN is a crucial regulator of ICl(Ca) in PA cells and that this regulation exhibits a high degree of isoform selectivity. However, the effects of CaN rest in a delicate balance with the suppressive effects of CaMKII and probably other kinases and it is the relative contribution of these enzymes that dictates the amplitude of ICl(Ca). A corollary to this point is that the relative dominance of CaMKII and CaN probably differs between smooth muscles and will alter with different [Ca2+]i. In view of its greater sensitivity to Ca2+-CaM, CaN would be expected to dominate ICl(Ca) regulation at lower [Ca2+]i, whereas CaMKII will predominate when [Ca2+]i is raised (i.e. during agonist stimulation). A necessary caveat to this generalized hypothesis is that other Ca2+-independent phosphatases that have not been tested in this study may also regulate ICl(Ca)."

(EC 3.1.3.2) enzymes catalyze hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters at a pH range of 4–7. The physiological role of these enzymes in cells is not well understood, partly because ACPs are widely distributed in nature and appear to be ubiquitous, exhibiting minimal substrate specificity (1Duff S.M.G. Sarath G. Plaxton W.C. Physiol. Plant. 1994; 90: 791-800Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). ACP has been implicated in the release, transport, and recycling of inorganic phosphate. Recent comparative analysis of the structure of ACPs from higher plants and mammals has allowed the identification of conserved sequence and sequence motifs in this enzyme from many species (2Schenk G. Guddat L.W. Ge Y. Carrington L.E. Hume D.A. Hamilton S. de Jersey J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Li D. Zhu H. Liu K. Liu X. Leggewie G. Udvardi M. Wang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27772-27781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Plant ACPs are present in various organs of germinating seeds and also in different cell compartments, suggesting that the enzyme is involved at various cellular metabolic and bioenergetic levels. Plant ACPs are also induced under various environmental and developmental conditions, including salt or drought stress, seed germination, flowering, and pathogen infection (4Plaxton W.C. Carswell M.C. Lerner H.R. Plant Response to Environmental Stress: From Phytohormones to Genome Reorganization. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 349-372Google Scholar, 5Bozzo G.G. Raghothama K.G.

Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo function of plant ACPs remains largely unknown, although the stimulation of phosphatase activities in response to phosphate starvation is well documented, and ACPs play a role in the utilization of phosphate compounds (1Duff S.M.G. Sarath G. Plaxton W.C. Physiol. Plant. 1994; 90: 791-800Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Purple ACPs are commonly found in a wide range of plant species and belong to a family of nonspecific ACPs containing a dinuclear Fe-Me center (where Me can be iron or zinc) in their active sites (2Schenk G. Guddat L.W. Ge Y. Carrington L.E. Hume D.A. Hamilton S. de Jersey J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The purple ACP from the kidney bean was first characterized by Beck et al. (7Beck J.L. McConchie L.A. Summors A.C. Arnold W.N. de Jersey J. Zerner B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 61-68Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is a dimeric enzyme with two identical subunits that can each be crystallized. The active site contains a Fe3+-Zn2+ system in both subunits. The subunits are connected by a disulfide bond, and the purple color is due to tyrosine-Fe3+ charge transfer transitions (8Gaber B.P. Sheridan J.P. Bazer F.W. Roberts R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8340-8342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many reports indicate that purple ACPs belong to the metallo-phosphatase family of proteins, which also includes phosphoprotein phosphatase and other types of phosphomonoesterases (3Li D. Zhu H. Liu K. Liu X. Leggewie G. Udvardi M. Wang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27772-27781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 9Klabunde T. Strater N. Frohlich R. Witzel H.

Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Recently the enzyme active sites of the ACP have been shown to be somewhat conserved in a completely different class of enzymes, the vanadium haloperoxidases (11Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Neuwald A.F. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1764-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting that nature has developed the same type of binding site for phosphate and vanadium. The ACPs are classified into several different groups. Sequence motifs are shared between the membrane-associated phosphatases, including type 2 phosphatase and vanadate-dependent chloroperoxidase. Similarly, haloperoxidases have been reported to perform phosphatase reactions by substituting the vanadate group with phosphate (11Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Renirie R. Hemrika W. Wever R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11650-11657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, del Pozo et al. (14del Pozo J.C. Allona I. Rubio V. Leyva A. de la Pena A. Aragoncillo C. Paz-Ares J. Plant J. 1999; 19: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) reported that purple ACP-like protein (AtACP5) from Arabidopsis thaliana induced by phosphate starvation exhibited phosphatase activity and simultaneously catalyzed the peroxidation of luminal. This activity was probably dependent upon the ferrous moiety of the AtACP5. In the present study we found for the first time in a plant species an ACP enzyme that is able to catalyze chloroperoxidation by substituting the apo-enzyme with vanadate. This fact suggests that KeACP may play a role in modifying a wide variety of chlorinated compounds that are present in higher plants, because the halo-metabolites are mainly formed through oxidation of halides by haloperoxidase and H2O2 and by a subsequent reaction with a nucleophilic acceptor (15Wever R. Kustin K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 35: 81-115Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The first process in germination is the uptake of water by seeds during imbibition. A number of physical and biochemical changes are induced in response to this, including ACP activity, resulting in germination and subsequent elongation of the embryonic axis. Germination mechanisms, including the early stage of embryonic axis elongation, are still poorly understood, although the amount of ACP has been shown to increase significantly in seeds upon germination (16Bhargava R. Sachar R.C. Phytochemistry. 1987; 26: 1293-1297Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consequently, there is interest in the identification and characterization of enzymes that are actively transcribed and synthesized during the germination process. Despite numerous reports that ACPs occur in a variety of plants and plant tissues, the exact physiological role of these enzymes has yet to be established. In the present work we describe the purification and cloning of KeACP from kidney bean embryonic axes and biochemical characterization of this enzyme, which was distinct from purple ACP. Furthermore, we discuss the physiological role of KeACP in responses to germination of the kidney bean. Plant Materials—Kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. Ohfuku) dry seeds from the 2001 harvest were obtained from a farm in Hokkaido, Japan. They were sterilized in 30-ppm 2-(4-thiazolyl)benzimidazole for 15 min and rinsed with distilled water. Purification of KeACP from Embryonic Axes of Kidney Bean—Sterilized kidney bean seeds were soaked with distilled water at room temperature for 1 h. Imbibited seeds were then transferred onto a 0.56% agar plate containing 0.4 mm phosphorus and incubated at 25 °C in darkness. After incubation for 72 h, the embryonic axes were removed from the germinated seeds and collected. Subsequent purification steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. Embryonic axes (600 g) were homogenized with three volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). The homogenates were then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 45 min. The crude extract was precipitated sequentially with ammonium sulfate fractionation 40% and then 60% saturation. The precipitate was then suspended in a small volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and dialyzed against the same buffer. Protein that precipitated during dialysis was removed by centrifugation. The enzyme solution was applied to a DEAE Toyopearl 650S column (2.6 × 40 cm) (Tohso, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The adsorbed materials were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.5 m in 500 ml of the buffer. The fractions having enzyme activity were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl. The enzyme solution was loaded onto a concanavalin A (Con A)-Sepharose column (1.6 × 40 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with dialysis buffer. After washing the column, the adsorbed enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of d-(+)-mannose concentration gradient from 0 to 0.5 m in the equilibrated buffer. The fractions having enzyme activity were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1.4 m ammonium sulfate. The dialyzed sample was applied to a butyl Toyopearl 650S column (1.6 × 40 cm) (Tohso) equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate concentration from 1.4 to 0 m in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Active fractions were collected and concentrated to minimal volume using membrane filter YM1 or PM30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). PAGE and Protein Sequencing—Non-denaturating (native) PAGE was carried out at 4 °C using a 5% polyacrylamide gel (pH 8.8). ACP activity staining was carried out by incubating the gels with acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.1 mg/ml Fast Black K salt (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml α-naphthyl phosphate in the dark at room temperature until colored bands appeared. SDS-PAGE was performed using a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the presence and absence of 2-ME. The separated protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB). The size markers were phosphorylase b (97 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), egg ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa). Glycoprotein staining of the gel was performed according to a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-staining protocol. For the N-terminal amino acid sequence, the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry apparatus according to the method described previously (17Hirano H. Watanabe T. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The peptide fragments were generated by limited proteolysis with Staphylococcal V8 protease and Achromobacter lyticus lysyl endopeptidase during electrophoresis. After the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were briefly stained with CBB, the stained bands were excised. The N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined using an automated protein sequence analyzer (Model 492HT, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Analytical Gel Filtration—A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (1.0 × 30 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated by calibration with standard proteins, thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Deglycosylation of KeACP—Deglycosylation of the purified KeACP was performed using the N-glycosidase F deglycosylation Kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified enzyme (50 μg) was denatured in 10 μl of denaturation buffer (pH 8.6) containing 1% SDS at 95 °C for 3 min and was transferred into reaction buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The reaction mixture was incubated with 12 units of peptide-N-glycosidase F for 12 h at 37 °C. Samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained by CBB and PAS reagent. Assay for ACP Activity—The ACP activity of the enzyme was determined by following the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) at 410 nm. The optimum pH of the enzyme was around pH 6.0, and it showed activity in the range of pH 5 to 8 (data not shown). The routine assay was performed at 30 °C by adding 50 μl of enzyme solution to 0.5 ml of reaction mixture consisting of 50 mmp-NPP and 200 mm Tris maleate (pH 6.0). One enzyme unit was defined as 1 μmol of p-NPP hydrolyzed/min. Substrate specificity of the KeACP was estimated by incubating the purified enzyme with various substrates (17 kinds). The assay was carried out at 30 °C by adding 50 μl of the enzyme solution to a reaction mixture containing 10 mm target substrate and 50 mm Tris maleate (pH 6.0), and phosphorus released during the 2 min incubation was measured according to a method described previously (18Saini M.S. Van Etten R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 526: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In all assays one unit of enzyme activity was defined as 1 μmol of Pi released/min. Assays to examine the effects of metal ions and chemical agents (9 kinds) on ACP activity were carried out as above by incubating p-NPP at 30 °C for 30 min with native enzyme or enzyme that was dialyzed against buffer containing EDTA. All measurements were repeated five times, and the results represent the arithmetic means. Assay for Chloroperoxidase (CPO) Activity—Vanadate-substituted enzyme (V-CPO) was prepared by incubating the enzyme with various concentration of o-vanadate in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 30 °C for 30 min. The purified enzyme was then dialyzed against 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm EDTA. The CPO activity was measured by following the increase in the absorbance at 290 nm due to the chlorination of monochlorodimedon (MCD) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (11Hemrika W. Renirie R. Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The standard assay was carried out at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 2 mm H2O2, 5 mm KCl, and 100 mm citrate buffer (pH 5.0). One unit of CPO was defined as 1 μmol of MCD chlorinated/min. Cloning and Nucleotide Sequencing of the KeACP Gene—RNA was isolated from kidney bean embryonic axes elongated through 48 h after germination. Embryonic axes (0.1 g) were ground in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to “clean-up” recommendations of the manufacturer. The cDNA library was constructed using a SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used to amplify sequences were designed based on the partial nucleotide sequence of the KeACP gene and the A. thaliana putative ACP mRNA (GenBank™ accession number AY091415). The primers used were SAK01 for the 5′-RACE (5′-tgcacatcacgcaaggtcac-3′) and HAK01 for the 3′-RACE (5′-cctcaaggccttcaataacac-3′). Both 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR amplifications of cDNA were carried out using a Gene-Amp automated thermal cycler (Model 9700, Applied Biosystems) with appropriate cycle parameters. The purified 5′-RACE (600 bp) and 3′-RACE (1100 bp) PCR products were subcloned into a sequencing plasmid using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Total genomic DNA was extracted from fine meal of the kidney bean seed according to the plant DNA extraction method, as described previously (19Liu Y.G. Mitsukawa N. Oosumi T. Whittier R.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). To isolate the KeACP gene from the total genomic DNA by PCR, primers were designed and synthesized based on the cDNA sequence of KeACP that was determined in this study, as listed in Table I. The PCR products were sequenced on both strands using an ABI BigDye-Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). The dye-labeled extension products were analyzed with an automated DNA sequencer (Model 377, Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using MacVector sequence analysis software (Oxford Molecular, Ltd). The sequence data have been submitted to the GenBank™ data base under accession numbers AB116719 for full-length cDNA and AB116720 for genomic DNA of KeACP.Table IPCR primer sets for amplifying KeACP geneForward primerReverse primerPrimerSequencePositionPrimerSequencePositionT01F5′-TCC AGC TAT TCC GCC ATT TG-3′887-907T01R5′-CTC CAT TAC TGT TGT AGA GTG-3′979-1000T02F5′-TAA CAG GTA TCC CTT ACC TG-3′1186-1206T02R5′-TGT CAG GTA AGG GAT ACC TG-3′1148-1168T03F5′-CGG TGA TTC TTC TCG AGA G-3′480-499T03R5′-GCA CGC CTC ACT GCA TAC-3′829-847T04F5′-GCA TAA CCA GTA TTG GTA GG-3′1417-1437T04R5′-CAT CAT CAT TGC GGT TCC AG-3′1326-1346T05F5′-GGT TAT GAC TCT GTA GGC AG-3′1-20T05R5′-GTC TCG CCA TTT GTT CAA ATG-3′1488-1508T07F5′-ACA GGT ATC CCT TAC CTG AC-3′1166-1186S01R5′-ACG TGC ATG AGC ACA ATG AG-3′959-979S01F5′-ACT ACT CCC TAT TTG GCC TC-3′818-838S04R5′-CTA AGC CAT AAC GAT ATT AAA CTT CTA CC-3′1584-1613S02F5′-TCA TTG TGC TCA TGC ACG TG-3′999-1019HAK015′-CCT CAA GGC CTT CAA TAA CAC-3′409-429S03F5′-CAA GCT ATG GAC ACT CTA CC-3′1311-1331HAK025′-TTC CAT CGT AGT CAC CTT GC-3′240-259S04F5′-CTT GCT GTT GTG AGG AAT TG-3′1491-1511SAK025′-AAG CAT CCG GGT CAA CTT TG-3′490-510SAK015′-TGC ACA TCA CGC AAG GTC AC-3′229-249Eri025′-GGC CGA TTT GTT GAA AGG AG-3′705-725 Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were extracted from 0.1 g of embryonic axes of the kidney bean at different periods of growth on the agar plate at 25 °C in darkness until 72 h after the beginning of imbibition. RNAs were also extracted from 0.1 g of roots, leaf, and stem after 2 weeks of growth. The total RNAs extracted (30 μg) using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit were separated by 1% formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences). For dot blot analysis, 60 μg of total RNAs from each tissue were transferred to a nylon membrane as well. A DNA probe (245 bp) encoding a partial region of KeACP cDNA was labeled using a PCR-based digoxigenin-labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) with primer pair SAK01 and HAK01 (Table I). Northern hybridization was performed by high stringency hybridization at 60 °C overnight. Purification and Molecular Characteristics of KeACP from Embryonic Axes of Kidney Bean—Table II presents a summary of the purification procedure parameters. The enzyme was isolated from embryonic axes that elongated during germination of the kidney bean seed. KeACP was purified 852-fold to near homogeneity by anion-exchange DEAE column chromatography followed by Con A affinity and hydrophobic column chromatography. The Con A purification step effectively served to remove a significant amount of contaminating proteins, indicating that KeACP may be a glycoprotein. Through all column chromatography purification steps, a single chromatographic peak of KeACP activity was observed, and the final preparation was colorless. This suggests that neither purple color ACP, which has usually been found in dry seeds (20Nakatsuka M. Sagane Y. Kouguchi H. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Jpn. J. Electroph. 2000; 44: 139-143Google Scholar), nor multiple ACP forms are present in embryonic axes of kidney beans. The pH dependence of phosphatase activity was also investigated for KeACP, yielding a curve with a pH optimum at pH 6.0 (data not shown) that was almost identical to that of other ACPs.Table IISummary of the purification of KeACPPurification stageActivityTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationYieldunitsmgunits/mg-fold%Crude extract337174000.451100(NH4)2SO4 (40-60%)153014801.03245DEAE Toyopearl 650S9903382.29529Con A-Sepharose6451064.5414319Butyl Toyopearl 650S3680.96383.3385211 Open table in a new tab The apparent molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be around 96 kDa by analytical gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Fig. 1). SDS-PAGE of the purified preparation both in the presence and in the absence of 2-ME revealed the presence of 56- and 45-kDa polypeptides with different staining intensities by CBB and PAS in a 3:1 ratio, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). This suggests that the native enzyme has a dimeric structure with no intersubunit disulfide linkages. Furthermore, native-PAGE of the purified enzyme preparation showed three bands of protein with both CBB staining (Fig. 2D) and enzyme activity staining (Fig. 2E), indicating that native KeACP presents three forms of subunit structure. Both bands on the gel were stained with a PAS reagent, and the enzyme retained on Con A column was eluted with d-(+)-mannose, strongly suggesting that they are glycosylated. Deglycosylation of the KeACP with N-glycosidase F under the denaturation condition was partially successful. After 12 h of incubation, decreases in molecular mass of 2 and 1.4 kDa for dominant and minor subunits, respectively, on SDS-PAGE were observed (Fig. 2C). However, both bands were stained by PAS, indicating that the oligosaccharide chain had still not been removed. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of both bands were determined to be NH2-SEWPAVDIPLDHEAFAVPKG (Fig. 2B), implying that two subunits have identical N-terminal sequences, but one probably has an excision of more than 100 amino acids in its C-terminal region and/or has a different glycosylation pattern.Fig. 2SDS- and native-PAGE analyses in the presence and absence of 2-ME and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of KeACP.A, SDS-PAGE of the purified KeACP (2 μg) in the presence of 2-ME (lane 1, indicated by 2-ME(+)) and absence of 2-ME (lane 2, indicated by 2-ME(–)) using a 10% separating gel. Protein bands in both lanes were stained by CBB. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the bands are shown. B, glycoprotein staining of the purified KeACP (2 μg) separated from SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were stained by PAS. C, deglycosylation of the KeACP (2 μg) with N-glycosidase F separated from SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were stained by CBB and PAS.

Bands stained are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Substrate Specificity—Because the physiological relevant substrate(s) for KeACP is still unknown, the purified enzyme was tested for its activity against a variety of phosphorylated substrates (Table III). The activity against p-NPP was taken to be 100%. Relatively high activity was observed with phosphoenolpyruvate, and this was comparable with pyrophosphate, phosphorylated Tyr, β-naphthyl phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, and ADP with more than 50% activity. Several other compounds were also dephosphorylated by KeACP at a much lower rate compared with p-NPP. Bis-p-NPP, phytate and 5′-AMP were apparently poor substrates. As a result KeACP shows a wide variety of substrate specificity but not a preference for other substrates over p-NPP. However, it is noteworthy that KeACP-catalyzed dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Ser, Thr, and Tyr under the conditions employed.Table IIISubstrate specificity of purified KeACPSubstrateRelative activity%p-NPP100ADP545'-AMP13ATP40α-Naphthyl phosphate32β-Naphthyl phosphate59Bis-p-NPPNDaNot detected.Glucose-1-phosphatase58Glucose-6-phosphatase46Pyrophosphate652-Phosphoglycerate323-Phosphoglycerate34Phosphoenolpyruvate67Phytate16Phosphorylated Thr42Phosphorylated Ser28Phosphorylated Tyr63a Not detected. Open table in a new tab Effects of Various Chemicals on KeACP Activity—As shown in Table IV, like other ACPs, KeACP is inhibited completely by such typical inhibitors as vanadate (VO4−3) and molybdate (Mo6+) at 100 μm, whereas the other metal ions (Zn2+, Fe3+, and Mn2+) at 10 μm concentration revealed no influence on KeACP activity. Metal chelating agents such tartrate, citrate, fluoride, and EDTA at 100 μm concentration had no inhibitory effect but, rather, caused a small increase in activity.Table IVEffect of metal ions and chemical agents on the KeACP activityAdditionRelative activityaData represent the arithmetic means of five experiments.10 μm100 μm% of controlZn2+101.070.3Fe3+108.4102.1Mn2+105.594.8VO4-35.39.5Mo6+37.612.6Tartrate97.6110.3Citrate99.199.3NaF114.2107.4EDTA96.8103.7a Data represent the arithmetic means of five experiments. Open table in a new tab Vanadate-substituted CPO Activity—After overnight dialysis against Tris-HCl buffer containing 20 mm EDTA to remove metals, chloroperoxidase activity was tested in a MCD chlorination assay by the incubation of apoKeACP with vanadate for 30 min at 30 °C. In the presence of 100 μm vanadate, MCD was clearly chlorinated. In the absence of vanadate, the apoenzyme revealed phosphatase activity at the same level as the native enzyme but no chloroperoxidase activity. On the other hand, vanadate-substituted purple color ACP prepared from kidney bean seed (20Nakatsuka M. Sagane Y. Kouguchi H. Watanabe T. Ohyama T. Jpn. J. Electroph. 2000; 44: 139-143Google Scholar) revealed no chloroperoxidase activity under the same conditions, such as dialysis against EDTA buffer followed by incubation with vanadate. This means that the vanadate-substituted KeACP uniquely catalyzes the chloroperoxidation reaction. Fig. 3A shows that more than 100 μm vanadate was required to obtain full chloroperoxidase activity and that ACP activity disappeared at rates depending upon the concentration of vanadate added. A modified Hill plot (21Loftfield R.B. Eigner E.A. Science. 1969; 164: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with vanadate is shown in Fig. 3B. The interaction between enzyme and vanadate showed a linear relationship, and its Hill constant, calculated from the slope, was ∼1.0. This may reflect the fact that the number of vanadate binding sites on the enzyme is one molecule binding to either subunit or that two molecules bound to both subunits with equivalent affinity. The apparent dissociation constant, Kd, was determined to be 6.6 μm vanadate, as shown in Fig. 3B. The kinetic parameters, Km values for H2O2 and chloride (KCl), were determined as 0.79 and 7.6 mm, respectively, in the presence of"

Core complex formation between vesicle-associated SNARE and target membrane SNARE perhaps drives the merging of two membranes into a single bilayer. Using spin-labeling EPR, trans-SNARE complex formation was monitored “locally” at four different core locations of recombinant yeast SNAREs, which are individually reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The results indicate that the time scales of core formation are virtually the same at all four locations throughout the core region, indicating the possibility of a single step core assembly, which appears to be somewhat different from what has been postulated by the “zipper” model. The EPR data were then compared with the kinetics of the lipid mixing measured with the fluorescence assay. The analysis suggests that SNARE core assembly occurs on a much faster time scale than the lipid mixing, providing a new insight into the timing of individual events in SNARE-induced membrane fusion.

In eukaryotic cells, transport of newly synthesized lipids and proteins and secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones require the fusion of cargo vesicles to the target membrane. Membrane fusion, however, does not occur spontaneously without the coordinated effort of specialized proteins because of the exceptional stability of the bilayer structure. It has been postulated that the intracellular membrane fusion machinery is built around highly conserved SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimidesensitive factor attachment protein receptor; v-, vesicle-associated; t-, target membrane; GST, glutathione S-transferase; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylserine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimidesensitive factor attachment protein receptor; v-, vesicle-associated; t-, target membrane; GST, glutathione S-transferase; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylserine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. proteins (1Söllner T.

Interestingly, the four helices in the coiled coil are aligned parallel, similar to a feature commonly found in viral fusion proteins such as flu hemagglutinin and human immunodeficiency virus gp41 (14Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that liposome-reconstituted SNAREs drive the lipid mixing (15Weber T.

A SNARE family participating in yeast protein trafficking, along with SNAREs involved in neurotransmitter release at synapses, is a prototypical system (17Gerst J.E. Biochim. Biophys.

An integral membrane protein Snc is yeast v-SNARE or the analog of neuronal synaptobrevin, and Sso and Sec9 are two t-SNARE proteins or yeast counterparts of neuronal t-SNAREs syntaxin and soluble NSF attachment protein 25 (19Protopopov V.

Prior to complex formation v-SNARE is largely unstructured. However, evidence indicates that the two t-SNAREs form a binary complex (23Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10928-10933Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For yeast t-SNAREs, the coiled coil motifs associate only at the N-terminal half to form a three-stranded helical bundle, which leaves the C-terminal half to remain mostly unstructured (27Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). On the basis of this structure, it has been speculated that this partially formed t-SNARE complex might serve as an intermediate for the interaction with v-SNARE (27Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It has been believed that SNARE core formation proceeds in at least two steps (17Gerst J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Fasshauer D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A partial complex is initially formed at the membrane-distal N-terminal region followed by coiled coil formation at the membrane-proximal C-terminal region. This “zipper model” has been supported by a line of experimental evidence, particularly for neuronal SNAREs (29Melia T.J. Weber T. McNew J.A. Fisher L.E. Johnston R.J. Parlati F. Mahal L.K.

However, the mechanistic steps involved in the zippering process and their temporal relationship to membrane fusion are largely unknown. Furthermore, it is not known whether the zipper model is generally applicable to other systems such as yeast SNAREs. In this work, site-directed spin labeling (35Hubbell M.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 36Hubbell M.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) and timeresolved EPR (37Shin Y.K. Levinthal C. Levinthal F. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were used to monitor core complex formation as an attempt to characterize the zippering process for yeast SNAREs. Further, we compared the EPR data with the results from the fluorescence lipid-mixing assay. The results suggest that the major portion of the coiled coil core is formed in a single step, which occurs in a significantly faster time scale than the lipid mixing. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—DNA sequences encoding Sso1pH3 (amino acids 185–265), Sso1pHT (amino acids 185–290), Snc2pS (amino acids 1–93), and Snc2pF (amino acids 1–115) were inserted into the pGEX-KG vector between EcoRI and HindIII sites as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Sec9c (amino acids 401–651) was inserted into pET-24b(+) between NdeI and XhoI sites as a C-terminal His6-tagged protein. To introduce a unique cysteine residue for the specific nitroxide attachment, native cysteine 266 of Sso1pHT and native cysteine 94 of Snc2pF were mutated to alanines. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate all mutants, and DNA sequences were confirmed by the Iowa State University DNA Sequencing Facility. Protein Expression, Purification, and Spin Labeling—Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3)pLysS (Novagene). The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with glucose (2 g/liter), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) until the A600 reached 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were grown further for 4 more hours at 22 °C. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min. GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in resuspension buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v); PBST) with 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were broken by sonication on the ice bath. For Snc2pF and Sso1pHT, 1% of N-lauroylsarcosine was added to the solution before sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with glutathione-agarose beads in the resuspension buffer and nutated at 4 °C for 40 min. The protein bound beads were washed with an excess volume of washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). For Sso1pHT and Snc2pF, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added, whereas no detergent was added for Sso1pH3 and Snc2pS when washing. The beads were then washed with thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) either with 0.2% Triton X-100 for Sso1pHT and Snc2pF or without detergent for Sso1pH3 and Snc2pS. Finally the proteins were cleaved off from the resin by thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature for 40 min. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride was added to the protein after cleaving from the resin (2 mm final concentration). The protein was stored at –80 °C with 10% (w/v) glycerol. Cysteine mutants of Snc2pF were spin labeled before thrombin cleavage. After the cell lysate was incubated with beads and washed with PBS buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100, dithiothreitol was added to the final concentration of 5 mm at 4 °C for 40 min. The beads were then washed eight times with an excess volume of PBS buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100 to remove dithiothreitol. Approximately, 20-fold excess of 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolinyl-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate spin label was added to the protein, and the reaction mixture was left overnight at 4 °C. Free methanethiosulfonate spin label was removed by washing with excess PBS buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100. The proteins were cleaved off by thrombin in cleavage buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100. The His6-tagged protein Sec9c was expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3)pLysS. The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with glucose (2 g/liter), kanamycin (30 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) until the A600 reached 0.6–0.8. After the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm), the cells were grown further for 4 h more at 30 °C. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min. For purification, the frozen cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS buffer with 20 mm imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0). After sonication on ice, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) in lysis buffer. The mixture was nutated for binding at 4 °C for 40 min. Subsequently, the beads were washed with washing buffer (PBS buffer with 50 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Then the protein was eluted out by elution buffer (PBS buffer with 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The protein was kept at –80 °C with 10% glycerol. All purified proteins were examined with 15% SDS-PAGE. Membrane Reconstitution—Large unilamella vesicles (∼100 nm in diameter) of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) containing 15 mol % of 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) were prepared in a buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) using an extruder. Proteins were reconstituted into the vesicles by the Bio-Beads dialysis method (38Chen Y. Xu Y. Zhang F. Shin Y.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reconstituted vesicles were concentrated using the 100-kDa molecular mass cut off centrifugal filter (Millipore) before taking EPR spectra. EPR Data Collection—EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer equipped with a loop-gap resonator. Time traces of EPR spectral changes were collected using a two-syringe stopped-flow instrument that was custom fitted to the spectrometer. The conformational change of each mutant was monitored in real time by measuring the central peak height of the first derivative EPR spectra. Fusion Assay—For the fluorescence lipid mixing fusion assay, Snc2pF was reconstituted to vesicles containing POPC, DOPS, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) in the molar ratio of 82:15:1.5:1.5. SSo1pHT was reconstituted to separate vesicles containing POPC and DOPS in the molar ratio of 85:15. The detergent in the samples was removed by the Bio-Beads method (38Chen Y. Xu Y. Zhang F. Shin Y.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The samples were then dialyzed against 2 liters of dialysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight to remove any trace amount of detergent that might interfere with the fluorescence measurements. After dialysis, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to get rid of protein and lipid aggregates. The final protein concentration in the vesicle was determined by measuring nitroxide concentration in the sample. The lipid to protein ratio was ∼150:1. Prior to the fusion assay, Sso1pHT-reconstituted vesicles were mixed with Sec9c in a molar ratio of 1:1, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min to aid in the formation of the binary t-SNARE complex. To monitor the lipid mixing, Snc2pF-reconstituted vesicles were mixed with the t-SNARE-reconstituted vesicles in a ratio of 1:2. The final solution contained ∼6 mm lipids. Fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 465 and 530 nm, respectively. Fluorescence changes were recorded with a Varian Cary Eclipse model fluorescence spectrophotometer using a quartz cell of 400 μl with a 2-mm path length. SNARE complex formation induces the conformational change for v-SNARE Snc2p from unstructured to α-helical (39Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Site-directed spin labeling is very effective in detecting such secondary structural changes, and the conformational change can be followed in real time with EPR. In site-directed spin labeling, native amino acids are site specifically replaced one by one with cysteines to which the nitroxide side chain is attached. The EPR line shape is sensitive to the motional rates of the nitroxide (40Schneider D.J. Freed J.H. Hirschfelder J.O. Wyatt R.E. Coalson R.D. Lasers, Molecules and Method. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 387-527Google Scholar). The helix formation usually involves a large EPR line shape change from a narrow spectrum reflecting the fast motion of the nitroxide to a broad spectrum reflecting the slow motion (41Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13390-13397Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Further, with site-directed spin labeling, conformational changes can be monitored “locally” at various locations of the polypeptide chain, providing a chance to resolve steps involved in the zippering process of SNARE complex formation. For example, if a partial SNARE complex was initially formed at the membrane-distal N-terminal region whereas the C-terminal regions remained unstructured, we should expect a large scale line broadening for the nitroxides attached to the N-terminal region. However, we would not expect spectral changes for the nitroxides attached to the C-terminal positions because this region remains unstructured, and no conformational change has occurred locally. In fact, such predicted spectral changes have been verified for a different partial SNARE complex. 2F. Zhang and Y.-K. Shin, unpublished data. Assembly of the Soluble SNARE Core Complex—First, as controls, we investigated core complex formation between soluble v- and t-SNAREs. Soluble parts of individual SNAREs containing coiled coil motifs Sso1pH3 (amino acids 185–265 of Sso1p), Sec9c (amino acids 401–651 of Sec9), and Snc2pS (amino acids 1–93 of Snc2p) were expressed in E. coli (Fig. 1). The purity of all recombinant proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE analysis after purification (data not shown). For EPR measurements, four spin labeled mutants of Snc2pS covering the coiled coil motif (R32C, I46C, E60C, and G76C) were prepared and labeled with a methanethiosulfonate spin label. EPR spectra of spin labeled Snc2pS (Fig. 2A, blue line) were all narrow reflecting the fast motion of the nitroxide, characteristic of a freely moving random coil. However, the addition of t-SNAREs Sec9c and Sso1pH3 changed EPR spectra to all broad (Fig. 2A, red line) reflecting the slow motion of the nitroxide, which indicates coiled coil formation.Fig. 2SNARE complex formation between soluble v-SNARE and soluble t-SNAREs monitored with time-resolved EPR. A, room temperature EPR spectra of spin labeled Snc2pS before (blue line) and after core complex formation (red line). EPR spectra for the complex are composed of two spectral components, the sharp one (triangle) representing uncomplexed Snc2p and the broad one (asterisk) representing the SNARE complex. B, time traces of EPR spectral changes after mixing Snc2pS and t-SNAREs (Sso1pH3 plus Sec9c) using the stopped-flow EPR. Sso1pH3 and Sec9c were mixed at least 30 min before the stop-flow experiments. The solid lines show the best fits to the bimolecular reaction kinetics. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer equipped with a loop-gap resonator. The time-dependent change of the EPR signal intensity was monitored at the spectral position indicated by the arrow in panel A. For rapid mixing syringe 1 was filled with 50 μm Sso1pS, and syringe 2 was filled with 50 μm t-SNAREs. The spectral change was recorded immediately after mixing. In all experiments, the concentrations of t- and v-SNAREs were kept the same (∼50 μm) to fit the data to the second order kinetics. The time trace was fitted with the equation representing the secondorder reaction kinetics [A]/[A0] = 1/(1 + k2[A0]t), where [A] is the concentration of Snc2pS at time t, [A0] is the initial concentration, and k2 is the reaction rate constant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For each mutant conformational change was monitored in real time after mixing Snc2pS and t-SNAREs using a two-syringe stopped-flow instrument that was custom fitted to EPR (42Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1987; 58: 1879-1886Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The time trace fitted well to the equation describing the bimolecular reaction kinetics (Fig. 2B). The second order rate constants (k2) from the analysis were 4,400, 4,900, 2,900, and 5100 s–1m–1 for R32C, I46C, E60C, and G76C, respectively. These values are similar to the results obtained previously using circular dichroism (39Nicholson K.L. Munson M. Miller R.B. Filip T.J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The k2 values are very similar for all mutants within experimental errors. Assembly of Phospholipid Vesicle-reconstituted SNAREs— Next, we investigated the assembly process of membrane-reconstituted SNAREs. Recombinant SNAREs containing transmembrane domains Sso1pHT (amino acids 185–290 of Sso1p) and Snc2pF (amino acids 1–115 of Snc2p) (Fig. 1) were expressed in E. coli. We deleted the N-terminal Habc domain for simplicity of analysis. Four cysteine mutants of Snc2pF at the same positions (R32C, I46C, E60C, and G76C) were prepared for spin labeling. Spin labeled mutants were then reconstituted into POPC vesicles containing 15 mol % negatively charged DOPS, a lipid composition commonly used to mimic the native cellular membrane (15Weber T.

Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We reconstituted t-SNAREs into separate vesicles of the same lipid composition for the stopped-flow EPR experiment. After reconstitution, the integrity of vesicles was verified with negative-staining electron microscopy (data not shown). The average diameter of the vesicles was ∼100 nm. When v-SNARE-reconstituted vesicles were mixed with vesicles carrying t-SNAREs, we observed an increase of the broad components over time for all mutants, indicating that SNARE complex formation had occurred (38Chen Y. Xu Y. Zhang F. Shin Y.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For each mutant, conformational change was followed in time with stopped-flow EPR after mixing reconstituted Snc2pF and reconstituted t-SNAREs. Again, the time traces were fitted with the bimolecular reaction kinetics (Fig. 3). The k2 values for R32C, I46C, E60C, and G76C were 98, 103, 98, and 230 s–1m–1, respectively, which are ∼40-fold slower on average than those observed for soluble SNAREs. For each mutant, the stop-flow experiment was performed at least three times and the k2 values from the individual measurements fall within the factor of 1.5 of the average value. Thus, it is intriguing to find that the rate constants were quite similar for all positions within experimental uncertainty. The k2 value for G76C was somewhat faster than those for other positions, although it is most likely that the variation is still within the experimental uncertainty. The fact that the rate constants for core complex formation for reconstituted SNAREs are much slower than those of soluble SNAREs is not surprising. For reconstituted SNAREs, core complex formation must be coupled to membrane fusion, which would significantly slow down the kinetics of core complex formation. Core SNARE Assembly Occurs Much Faster Than Membrane Fusion—Stopped-flow EPR showed that a major portion of the core is formed in a single kinetic step, somewhat different from what has been postulated by the zipper model. On the other hand, because SNARE core complex formation likely provides the driving force for membrane fusion, it is possible that coiled coil formation may be concomitant with membrane fusion. In fact, core complex formation for reconstituted SNAREs was 40-fold slower than that of soluble SNAREs, suggesting a strong coupling between SNARE assembly and membrane fusion. To test this possibility, we reconstituted Sso1pHT into POPC vesicles containing 15 mol % DOPS. We also reconstituted Snc2pF into the separate vesicles of the same lipid composition but with fluorescent acceptor and donor lipid pairs for the measurement of lipid mixing. In both cases, the lipid to protein ratio was ∼150:1. We pre-incubated Sso1pHT-reconstituted vesicles with sec9c for 30 min and subsequently mixed this vesicle solution with Snc2pF-reconstituted vesicles. The increase of fluorescence signal caused by the lipid mixing is depicted in Fig. 4. The time traces of the fluorescence change were compared with those of SNARE assembly detected with EPR for mutant samples prepared under identical conditions. It is clearly shown that SNARE core formation occurs on a much faster time scale than membrane fusion. Thus, combining the EPR and fluorescence results it appears that a major portion of the SNARE core (if not all) is formed much earlier than the onset of the lipid mixing. A current model for SNARE-induced membrane fusion postulates that the pressing force generated by trans-SNARE assembly provides the free energy necessary to overcome the fusion activation energy barrier. Intuitively, then, one might think that SNARE assembly might be concurrent with the lipid mixing, assuming a strong coupling between SNARE core formation and the lipid mixing. Stopped-flow EPR experiments revealed that most SNARE core (if not all) is formed in a single kinetic step for yeast SNAREs. This is a somewhat unexpected result, different from what has been predicted by the zipper model. Further, the results suggest that core complex formation occurs on a much faster time scale than the lipid mixing. There are at least two possible scenarios for such distinct differences in time scales between core SNARE complex formation and lipid mixing. First, the zipper model postulates that SNARE core formation proceeds in at least two sequential steps (17Gerst J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Fasshauer D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A partial complex is initially formed at the N-terminal region followed by coiled coil formation at the C-terminal region. Previous electrophysiological studies of adrenal chromatin cells (32Xu T. Rammner B. Margittai M. Artalejo A.R. Neher E. Jahn R. Cell. 1999; 99: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), toxin cleavage analysis of crayfish neurons (33Hua S.Y. Charlton M.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1078-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and results from cracked PC-12 cells (34Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) all indicated the existence of partially formed, loosely held complex that involves only the N-terminal region of SNAREs in support of the zipper model. In the present experiments, we probed the core SNARE assembly at four different positions: 32, 46, 60, and 76. Sequence alignment between neuronal and yeast v-SNAREs indicates that the core region of Snc2p extends to residue 89. Therefore, it is possible, although speculative, that coiled coil formation in the region of residues 77–89 may occur as a discrete step following the initial coiled coil formation. It has been shown previously that this region has the affinity to the membrane surface distinct from the preceding core residues residing in solution (38Chen Y. Xu Y. Zhang F. Shin Y.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Perhaps the second coiled coil formation step in the membrane-interacting region may be the event that shares a similar time scale with lipid mixing. On the other hand, the zipper model may be specific for neuronal SNAREs but not applicable to the yeast SNAREs. Second, the lipid mixing requires the coordination of at least three SNARE complexes (45Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Proper positioning of several trans-SNARE complexes around the fusion site appears to be necessary to initiate the merge of two membranes (43Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. Durell S. Howard D.E. Morris S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 46Danieli T. Pelletier S.L. Henis Y.I. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In fact, for membrane fusion induced by influenza hemagglutinin, a lag time has been observed between the activation of the protein and the lipid mixing. This lag time has been interpreted as the period required for the coordination of several fusogenic hemagglutinin molecules. It is reasonable to assume that a similar cooperative action is necessary for the SNARE complexes, and this process is perhaps one of the rate-determining steps for membrane fusion. For yeast SNAREs, we have used the protein to lipid ratio of 150 for reconstitution, and the yield of reconstitution was more than 50%. This means that there are ∼300 SNARE molecules in one vesicle. It is possible that the fusion of two vesicles induces secondary cis-SNARE complex assembly in the fused membrane after the fusion between vesicles occurred. Then we might expect the time scale of SNARE assembly to follow that of membrane fusion. However, the fact that the time scale of SNARE assembly is significantly faster than that of membrane fusion (Fig. 4) argues that such secondary SNARE assembly is not a major event. In summary, using stopped-flow EPR the process of SNARE assembly was monitored in real time at four different core positions. The rates of SNARE assembly were similar for all positions, indicating that a major part of the coiled coil is formed in a single step. When the SNARE assembly rates were compared with those of the lipid mixing determined with the fluorescence assay, it was found that initial coiled coil formation occurs much faster than lipid mixing."
https://openalex.org/W2029049857,"Endo-β-mannosidase is a novel endoglycosidase that hydrolyzes the Manβ1-4GlcNAc linkage in the trimannosyl core structure of N-glycans. This enzyme was partially purified and characterized in a previous report (Sasaki, A., Yamagishi, M., Mega, T., Norioka, S., Natsuka, S., and Hase, S. (1999) J. Biochem. 125, 363–367). Here we report the purification and molecular cloning of endo-β-mannosidase. The enzyme purified from lily flowers gave a single band on native-PAGE and three bands on SDS-PAGE with molecular masses of 42, 31, and 28 kDa. Amino acid sequence information from these three polypeptides allowed the cloning of a homologous gene, AtEBM, from Arabidopsis thaliana. AtEBM was engineered for expression in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein comprised a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of 112 kDa corresponding to the sum of molecular masses of three polypeptides of the lily enzyme. The recombinant protein hydrolyzed pyridylamino derivatives (PA) of Manα1-6Manβ1-4Glc-NAcβ1-4GlcNAc into Manα1-6Man and GlcNAcβ1-4Glc-NAc-PA, showing that AtEBM is an endo-β-mannosidase. AtEBM hydrolyzed MannManα1-6Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-PA (n = 0–2) but not PA-sugar chains containing Manα1-3Manβ or Xyloseβ1-2Manβ as for the lily endo-β-mannosidase. AtEBM belonged to the clan GH-A of glycosyl hydrolases. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that two glutamic acid residues (Glu-464 and Glu-549) conserved in this clan were critical for enzyme activity. The amino acid sequence of AtEBM has distinct differences from those of the bacterial, fungal, and animal exo-type β-mannosidases. Indeed, AtEBM-like genes are only found in plants, indicating that endo-β-mannosidase is a plant-specific enzyme. The role of this enzyme in the processing and/or degradation of N-glycan will be discussed. Endo-β-mannosidase is a novel endoglycosidase that hydrolyzes the Manβ1-4GlcNAc linkage in the trimannosyl core structure of N-glycans.

Indeed, AtEBM-like genes are only found in plants, indicating that endo-β-mannosidase is a plant-specific enzyme. The role of this enzyme in the processing and/or degradation of N-glycan will be discussed. Endo-β-mannosidase is a novel endoglycosidase that hydrolyzes a Manβ1-4GlcNAc linkage in the trimannosyl core structure of N-glycans (1Sasaki A. Yamagishi M. Mega T. Norioka S. Natsuka S. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Along with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and peptide N-glycanase, it is classified as an endo-type hydrolase that acts close to the reducing end of the N-glycans attached to proteins. Discovery of this enzyme was based on a structural analysis of the N-glycans of Japanese pear S-RNases, which has chitobiose as the major N-glycan (2Ishimizu T. Norioka S. Kanai M. Clarke A.E. Sakiyama F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 627-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 3Ishimizu T. Mitsukami Y. Shinkawa Y. Natsuka S. Hase S. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Norioka S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 624-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This enzyme activity has been identified in the crude extract from lily flowers using a pyridylamino (PA) 1The abbreviations used are: PA, pyridylamino; GlcNAc, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; Man, d-mannose; pNP, p-nitrophenyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. Manα1-6Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc as the substrate (1Sasaki A. Yamagishi M. Mega T. Norioka S. Natsuka S. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The partially purified enzyme hydrolyzed MannManα1-6Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-PA (n = 0–2) to MannManα1-6Man and GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-PA, confirming that this enzyme was an endoglycosidase. It does not hydrolyze β-mannohexasaccharide and is therefore different from β-mannanase (4Villarroya H. Petek F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 438: 200-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It also differs from β-mannosidases, because endo-β-mannosidase does not hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl β-mannoside (pNP β-Man) (1Sasaki A. Yamagishi M. Mega T. Norioka S. Natsuka S. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Sugahara K. Okumura T. Yamashina I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Substrates containing Manα1-3Manβ and/or Xyloseβ1-2Manβ structures were not hydrolyzed with the partially purified enzyme. The substrate specificity of endo-β-mannosidase complements that of the jack bean α-mannosidase, which displays a preference for a Manα1-3Manβ linkage. Therefore the N-linked chitobiose in S-RNase (3Ishimizu T. Mitsukami Y. Shinkawa Y. Natsuka S. Hase S. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Norioka S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 624-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) is probably produced by consecutive digestion of high mannose-type N-glycans with α-mannosidase and endo-β-mannosidase. We are interested both in the function of endo-β-mannosidase in the plant cell and also the enzyme mechanism of this unique substrate specificity. In this paper, we describe the purification of endo-β-mannosidase from lily flowers. Partial amino acid sequence data from the purified protein enabled us to clone the corresponding gene from Arabidopsis thaliana. The gene was engineered for expression in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was found to possess endo-β-mannosidase activity. The sequence of the enzyme was characterized, and the substrate specificity of the enzyme was investigated. Based on these results, its possible function in vivo is discussed. Flower buds of the lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb. cv. Hinomoto) were used as an enzyme source. PA-sugar chains listed in Table I were prepared as reported previously (6Yanagida K. Ogawa H. Omichi K.

DEAE-Sephacel, a Superdex 200 column (1.6 × 60 cm), and a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (0.5 × 5 cm) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The HA 1000 hydroxyapatite column (0.75 × 7.5 cm) was from Tosoh (Tokyo, Japan), and the Poros HS column (0.46 × 10 cm) from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The Shodex Asahipak NH2-P columns (0.46 × 7 cm) were from Showa Denko (Tokyo, Japan). The Inertsil ODS-3 column (0.46 × 25 cm) was from GL Sciences (Tokyo, Japan), and the CarboPac PA-1 column (0.2 × 25 cm) was from Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA). Diaflo membranes (XM-50 and YM-10) were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). The BCA protein assay reagent kit was from Pierce. Jack bean α-mannosidase and almond peptide N-glycanase were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). The anti-lily endo-β-mannosidase antibody was raised by immunizing a rabbit with the purified lily endo-β-mannosidase.Table ISugar chain structures and abbreviations used in the present study Open table in a new tab Endo-β-mannosidase activity was measured as described previously (1Sasaki A. Yamagishi M. Mega T. Norioka S. Natsuka S. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme and 12.5 μm M2B-PA in 16 μl of 0.16 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The chitobiose-PA generated was quantified by size-fractionation HPLC. The pH dependence and stability of the enzyme activities were measured using M2B-PA as a substrate with 0.2 m sodium citrate phosphate buffer, pH 3.0–8.0. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 nmol of PA-chitobiose from 12.5 μm M2B-PA/min under the conditions used. PA-sugar chains were analyzed by size-fraction and reversed-phase HPLC with the following elution conditions. Size-fractionation HPLC was performed on an NH2-P column at the flow rate of 0.6 ml/min by isocratic elution. The eluent used was 3% (v/v) acetic acid in a 400:85 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile:water adjusted to pH 7.3 with triethylamine. Reversed-phase HPLC was performed on an Inertsil ODS-3 column at the flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The eluents used were 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.0 (Buffer A), and 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, containing 1.0% 1-butanol (Buffer B). The column was equilibrated in Buffer A containing 3% Buffer B. After injecting a sample, the proportion of Buffer B was increased linearly to 50% in 45 min. A Beckman model 332 chromatograph equipped with a Hitachi model 650-10 M fluorescence spectrophotometer was used. PA derivatives were detected by their fluorescence using an excitation and an emission wavelength of 310 and 380 nm, respectively. All HPLC procedures were carried out at 25 °C. For high pH anion-exchange chromatography, sugar chains were analyzed on a CarboPac PA-1 column equipped with a Dionex DX-500 system at the flow rate of 1.0 ml/min using isocratic elution in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide. The elution of sugar chains was monitored with a pulsed amperometric detector. All purification procedures were carried out below 4 °C. The amount of protein was determined using absorbance at 280 nm or a BCA protein assay reagent kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Step 1, Preparation of a Crude Enzyme Solution—Flower buds of the lily (1200 g) frozen with liquid nitrogen were powdered with a Waring blender. The powder was suspended in 4800 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (10,000 rpm, 3 min). The homogenate was centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used as a crude enzyme solution. Step 2, Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation—The precipitate formed with ammonium sulfate at 35% saturation was dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and then dialyzed against the same buffer. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 46,000 × g for 30 min was used in the next purification step. Step 3, DEAE-Sephacel Chromatography—The supernatant (160 ml) was placed on a DEAE-Sephacel column (4.6 × 55 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and the column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme activity was eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 0.5 m. The endo-β-mannosidase fraction (470 ml) was concentrated to 6.5 ml with an Amicon XM-50 membrane. Step 4, Superdex 200 Gel Filtration—The concentrated fraction in step 3 was loaded onto two tandemly connected Superdex 200 gel filtration columns using a fast protein liquid chromatography system at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The columns were equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1 m sodium chloride. The endo-β-mannosidase was eluted with the same buffer. The fraction containing endo-β-mannosidase activity was collected and concentrated to 5 ml with an Amicon XM-50 membrane. Step 5, Hydroxyapatite Chromatography—A hydroxyapatite HA 1000 column connected with a fast protein liquid chromatography system was equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After an injection of the concentrated enzyme solution, the column was washed with the same buffer for 10 min. The endo-β-mannosidase was eluted with a linear gradient of sodium phosphate (10–500 mm) within 50 min. The fractions with endo-β-mannosidase activity were desalted and concentrated to 1.3 ml with an Amicon YM-10 membrane. Step 6, Mono Q Chromatography—The enzyme fraction obtained in step 5 was applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with the same buffer for 10 min. The endo-β-mannosidase was eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 0.4 m over 60 min. The fraction containing endo-β-mannosidase was desalted and concentrated to 2 ml with an Amicon YM-10 membrane. Step 7, Poros HS Chromatography—The concentrated fraction obtained in step 6 was applied to a Poros HS column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with the same buffer for 10 min, and the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 1 m over 60 min. The endo-β-mannosidase fraction was pooled, concentrated to 2 ml with an Amicon YM-10 membrane, and stored on ice. Native-PAGE was performed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, pH 7.5, according to the method of Davis (8Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15957) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions with 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The purified lily enzyme was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the three polypeptide subunits were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the method of Hirano and Watanabe (10Hirano H. Watanabe T. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Protein bands were excised and submitted for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Edman degradation sequencing was performed by APRO Life Science Institute (Naruto, Japan). For internal amino acid sequence analyses, protein bands on an SDS-PAGE gel were excised, and they were digested with trypsin, pH 8.0, for 20 h at 35 °C. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC, and their elution was monitored at 210 nm. Purified peptides were submitted for amino acid sequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from the purified lily endo-β-mannosidase was screened against the protein data base using the TFASTA program (11Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). A candidate gene for endo-β-mannosidase (registered as AY045934 and AC000106 for DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data base or At1g09010 for a transcribed unit in the Arabidopsis genome data base) was identified. The candidate gene was amplified from A. thaliana cDNA using the following primers, F1, 5′-GCGCCATATGGCGGAGATCGGGAAG-3′; R1, 5′-GCGCGCTCAGCTCAACCAAAAACACTAAACC-3′. The PCR primers were derived from the putative N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences of the AY045934/AC000106/At1g09010 gene product. We also incorporated NdeI and Bpu1102I restriction sites into the F1 and R1 primers, respectively (underlined). KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cloned gene was named AtEBM. A. thaliana shoot cDNA (kindly donated from Dr. T. Kakimoto of Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) was used as a template for the PCR. PCR cycling was 94 °C (1 min), 30 cycles of 94 °C (0.25 min), 52 °C (0.5 min), and 70 °C (3 min), and 70 °C (10 min). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and then sequenced on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer using a BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) for the labeling of the sequencing reactions. The PCR product was subcloned into the NdeI and Bpu1102I sites of a bacterial expression vector pET15-b (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmid, AtEBMpET15, was transformed into E. coli RosettaBlue cells (Novagen). Cells were grown in 500 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 16 °Ctoan A600 of 0.5. The gene was expressed with an induction at 16 °C for 12 h with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Cell pellets were resuspended and disrupted in 10 ml of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 25 units/ml benzonase (Novagen) for 2 h on ice. Resuspended cells were subjected to three complete cycles of freeze-thawing. The extract was then centrifuged at 5500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, containing 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin. The sample was then applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.6 × 42 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. The column was washed with the same buffer, and the recombinant protein was eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 1 m. The endo-β-mannosidase fraction was collected and used as an enzyme solution. Site-directed mutagenesis of Glu-464 and Glu-549 of AtEBM was performed by overlap extension PCR according to the method Higuchi et al. (12Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). The AtEBMpET15 construct was used as a template DNA for mutagenic PCR reaction. For the construction of E464ApET15 (Glu-464 in AtEBM replaced Ala), the PCR fragments obtained with the oligonucleotides E464A sense/R2 (E464A sense, 5′-GTGGGTGGAAATGCACAAGTTCCGCC-3′, R2, 5′-GTACATGGACTGGCTCTGCAGCGG-3′) and F1/E464A antisense (E464A antisense, 5′-GGCGGAACTTGTGCATTTCCACCCAC-3′) were used as templates for another PCR reaction with F1 and R2 as primers. The resulting fragment was subcloned in BamHI/SacI sites of AtEBMpET15b. The E549ApET15 (Glu-549 in AtEBM replaced Ala) was constructed as described above using E549A sense and E549A antisense primers (E549A sense, 5′-TTCAATCCGGCGGTCGGCTCGGTTG-3′, E549A antisense, 5′-AACCGAGCCGACCGCCGGATTGAAC-3′). The resultant mutants were expressed in E. coli, and an enzyme solution for each mutant was prepared as described above. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was reacted with the first antibody (raised in rabbit against the endo-β-mannosidase purified from lily flowers) and then with the second antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody raised in goat against rabbit IgG, ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Positive bands were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphoaphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Purification of the Lily Endo-β-mannosidase—Endo-β-mannosidase was purified from lily flowers using a seven-step protocol described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). The results of the purification are summarized in Table II. Two peaks displaying endo-β-mannosidase activity were detected after DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (step 3) and gel filtration chromatography (step 4), indicating that at least two forms of endo-β-mannosidase exist in lily flowers (Fig. 1, A and B). The first peak from the anion exchange column and the second peak from the gel filtration column were used for purification. The characterization of the remaining peaks will be described elsewhere. Poros HS chromatography (step 7) was effective in removing residual contaminating proteins, although the yield of enzyme activity was relatively low in this step. From 1.2 kg of lily flowers, 36 μg of the purified enzyme was obtained. The purified protein gave a single band on native-PAGE and a single peak by gel filtration chromatography, which coincided with the enzyme activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Assuming that the protein is roughly globular, the native molecular mass was estimated to be ∼78 kDa by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2B). SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme showed that endo-β-mannosidase is comprised of three polypeptides with molecular masses of 28, 31, and 42 kDa (Fig. 2C). The combined molecular mass of these three bands is 101 kDa. The three bands were also detected under non-reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE (data not shown), indicating that these peptides were not bound covalently by a disulfide bond.Table IISummary of the purification of endo-β-mannosidase from lily flowersStepProcedureActivityProteinRecoverySpecific activityPurificationunitsmg%units/mg-fold1Crude enzyme5600260001000.2212Ammonium sulfate precipitation3200870563.6173DEAE-Sephacel800801410464Superdex 2002803.74.9753405Hydroxyapatite1701.13.01607206Mono Q1100.461.923011007Poros HS9.20.0360.162601200 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Native-PAGE and gel filtration of the purified enzyme and SDS-PAGE of proteins in each purification step.

N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 28-, 31-, and 42-kDa polypeptides were determined as EYHQTHELSI, GKQVLDSGWLAARSTELELTGVQ, and ETEDPSQYLDGTRVYIQGSMWEGFA, respectively. Internal amino acid sequences were VFIRGGNWILSDGLL and FHADMNFNMIR for the 28-kDa polypeptide, DVATQYVEGWDW for the 31-kDa polypeptide, and GTGSGVAFFLHF for the 42-kDa polypeptide. We searched for genes encoding proteins homologous to these amino acid sequences using TFASTA program. Several candidates were retrieved from the data base. We decided to focus our attention on the Arabidopsis gene, AY045934/AC000106/At1g09010. At1g09010 was registered as a cDNA of 3280 bp containing a 1944-bp open reading frame encoding a 74-kDa polypeptide with 647 amino acid residues. However, the PCR product amplified by primers constructed from genomic sequence around At1g09010 (AC000106) gave a 2835-bp open reading frame encoding a 107-kDa polypeptide with 944 amino acid residues (Fig. 3). This cloned gene was named AtEBM in this study. The putative amino acid sequence of AtEBM was homologous to all of the peptide sequences derived from the three polypeptides of the lily enzyme. Furthermore, the molecular mass of the putative AtEBM protein (107 kDa) corresponded to the sum of the three polypeptides of the lily enzyme (101 kDa). The data strongly suggested that AtEBM encodes an endo-β-mannosidase. Comparison of the Amino Acid Sequence of AtEBM with Those of Other β-Mannosidases—Sequence analysis revealed that AtEBM belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family 2 (13Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the purified lily endo-β-mannosidase and AtEBM were aligned with those of β-mannosidases from mammal (Bos taurus) (14Chen H. Leipprandt J.R. Traviss C.E. Sopher B.L.

The most homologous gene (73% identity) was from Gossypium hirsutum (AY187062), but a functional characterization of the encoded protein has not yet been performed. The conserved amino acid residues between endo-β-mannosidase and β-mannosidases (Fig. 3) appear to be important for the hydrolysis of Manβ1-4GlcNAc. Among them, Glu-549 of AtEBM is predicted to be a catalytic nucleophile, because the corresponding Glu residue of C. fimi β-mannosidase was identified as an essential nucleophile in a chemical modification experiment (23Stoll D. He S. Withers S.G. Warren A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). AtEBM is classified as a GH-A hydrolase (24Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar), and these hydrolases are proposed to have an (α/β)8 barrel structure and a general acid catalytic mechanism with retention of anomeric configuration. The catalytic proton donor residue has been identified in some hydrolases within the clan GH-A (25Durand P. Lehn P. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Henrissat B. Mornon J.-P. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and corresponds to Glu-464 of AtEBM. The amino acid sequence of endo-β-mannanase (26Bewley J.D. Burton R.A. Morohashi Y. Fincher G.B. Planta. 1997; 203: 454-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) showed some homology to the sequence around these two Glu residues in endo-β-mannosidase (data not shown). The phylogenetic tree based on the full amino acid sequences of β-mannosidases was constructed using a neighbor-joining method (27Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). AtEBM clustered with the G. hirsutum gene and was clearly separated from other β-mannosidases. Endo-β-mannosidase Activity of Recombinant AtEBM and Its Mutants—To determine whether AtEBM possesses endo-β-mannosidase activity, we engineered the AtEBM gene for heterologous expression in E. coli. E. coli cells are suitable as host cells for expression of the endo-β-mannosidase gene, because E. coli cells do not have any endo-β-mannosidase activity. The PCR fragment encoding the protein consisting of 944 amino acid residues was subcloned into an expression vector (pET15b) to yield AtEBMpET15. A soluble polypeptide with a molecular mass of 112 kDa was newly expressed in E. coli (Fig. 5, lane 2). This newly expressed protein cross-reacted with the anti-lily endo-β-mannosidase antibody (Fig. 5, lane 6), although this antibody non-specifically interacted with some E. coli proteins (Fig. 5, lanes 5–8). Comparisons between the hydrolysis activity against M2B-PA for the soluble fractions of cells transformed with AtEBMpET15 and that of mock cells (68 milliunit/g of protein and <0.01 milliunit/g of protein, respectively) showed that recombinant AtEBM hydrolyzed M2B-PA to GN2-PA. The soluble fraction of mock cells did not change the exogenous substrate, M2B-PA, showing that contaminating activity in mock cells was not affected the results. Two mutants, in which Glu-464 and Glu-549 of AtEBM were substituted to alanine residues, were constructed (E464ApET15 and E549ApET15, respectively) and expressed in E. coli. Glu-464 and Glu-549 are the proposed catalytic proton donor and nucleophile, respectively. The expression levels of both mutants, E464A and E549A, were similar to that of AtEBM (Fig. 5, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), but they did not show any enzyme activity (<0.01 milliunit/g of protein). These results showed that Glu-464 and Glu-549 in AtEBM were critical for enzyme activity. Characterization of AtEBM—The substrate specificity of the recombinant AtEBM was studied using PA-sugar chains. The endo-type hydrolase activity of the partially purified recombinant AtEBM was confirmed by observing the hydrolysis of Manα1-6Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-PA to Manα1-6Man and GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-PA at the molar ratio of 1.0:1.1. It also hydrolyzed M3C-PA in an endo-type manner to Manα1-3Manα1-6Man and GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc-PA (data not shown). The relative hydrolysis rates against PA-sugar chains are summarized in Table III. M2B-PA was the best substrate among the PA-sugar chains studied. M3C-PA and M4B-PA were hydrolyzed to GN2-PA, and M1-PA underwent slight hydrolysis. But the enzyme did not hydrolyze PA-sugar chains containing the Manα1-3Manβ structures such as M2A-PA, M3B-PA, M5A-PA, M9A-PA, and Bi-PA. As with the lily enzyme, M2X-PA containing a Xyloseβ1-2Manβ structure was not hydrolyzed by AtEBM (1Sasaki A. Yamagishi M. Mega T. Norioka S. Natsuka S. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Table IIISubstrate specificity of the purified endo-β-mannosidaseSubstrateHydrolysis rate(%)M2B-PA100M3C-PA37M4B-PA6.6M1-PA2.3M2A-PA<0.01M2X-PA<0.01M3B-PA<0.01M5A-PA<0.01M9A-PA<0.01Bi-PA<0.01 Open table in a new tab The optimal pH of the partially purified AtEBM was 5.0 (Fig. 6A). The enzyme activity was retained after incubation for 2 h at pH values between 4 and 6 (Fig. 6B) but was unstable below pH 3 and above pH 7. As with the lily enzyme, the enzyme activity of recombinant AtEBM was not perturbed by the addition of 10 mm EDTA or 2 mm Ca2+ (1Sasaki A. Yamagishi M. Mega T. Norioka S. Natsuka S. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Endo-β-mannosidase from lily flowers was purified to homogeneity for the first time. The molecular mass of the lily enzyme estimated from gel filtration chromatography (78 kDa) (Fig. 2B) did not correspond to the apparent molecular mass by SDS-PAGE (101 kDa) (Fig. 2C). This discrepancy may be caused by an interaction of the enzyme with the dextran resin of the Superdex gel leading to a delay in the elution of the protein from the column. Similar results have been reported for other glycosyl hydrolases (28Hamagashira N. Oku H. Mega T. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Araki T. Hashikawa S. Morishita T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 1741-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Dhanawansa R. Faridmoayer A. van der Merwe G. Li Y.X. Scaman C.H. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The lily endo-β-mannosidase is composed of three polypeptides (28, 31, and 42 kDa) (Fig. 2C). All of the amino acid sequence data from the lily enzyme aligned with the putative amino acid sequence of AtEBM (Fig. 3). Hence the three polypeptides of the lily enzyme may be encoded by a single gene homologous to AtEBM. Indeed, the partial nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone of the lily enzyme encodes all three polypeptides. 2T. Ishimizu and S. Hase, unpublished data. Even when the proteins were extracted from lily flowers in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture, the purified enzyme consisted of three polypeptides, leading us to conclude that these three polypeptides are not artificially generated during the purification procedures (data not shown). The lily endo-β-mannosidase may be translated as a single polypeptide chain, which is then immediately subject to proteolysis to generate the three polypeptides. Recombinant AtEBM from E. coli consisted of a single polypeptide that possessed similar characteristics to the lily endo-β-mannosidase activity, suggesting that posttranslational proteolysis of the lily enzyme may not be essential for catalytic activity. The conclusion of this topic must await the expression of the lily endo-β-mannosidase gene in a heterologous system. An amino acid sequence alignment of AtEBM and homologous proteins revealed that AtEBM belonged to the clan GH-A glycosyl hydrolase (24Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Enzyme activity of AtEBM mutated at Glu-464 or Glu-549 was not detected in this study, clearly showing that these two Glu residues of AtEBM are critical for enzyme activity. These two Glu residues are completely conserved in the clan GH-A, suggesting that endo-β-mannosidase has the same catalytic mechanism as other glycosyl hydrolases in the clan GH-A. Endo-β-mannosidase appears to be plant-specific, because this activity was not detected in mammalian cells (rat liver, mouse liver, quail liver, salmon egg, and zebrafish egg), 3S. Hase, unpublished results. and because sequences highly homologous to endo-β-mannosidase are not found in other genomes than the plant genome sequences. All of the homologous genes from species other than plant were exo-type β-mannosidase (Fig. 3). The only highly homologous gene, the G. hirsutum (cotton) gene (AY187062), presumably encodes an endo-β-mannosidase. The optimal pH and pH stability of the enzyme suggested that it operates in an acidic organelle such as the vacuole or a secretory vesicle. S-RNase, a candidate substrate for endo-β-mannosidase, is a secretory protein. The N-glycan of S-RNase may be subject to hydrolysis by endo-β-mannosidase in one of the organelles or secretory vesicles that the protein passes through during secretion. Any potential signal sequences that target the protein for an organelle were not found in the sequence of AtEBM. The precise location of the endo-β-mannosidase within the cell remains to be determined. Both the lily enzyme and the enzyme subsequently identified from A. thaliana (AtEBM) catalyzed the hydrolysis of the Manβ1-4GlcNAc linkage in the trimannosyl core structure of the N-linked sugar chains. But the endo-β-mannosidase does not hydrolyze the Manβ1-4GlcNAc linkage in oligosaccharides containing Manα1-3Manβ. Therefore this enzyme has a complementary substrate specificity to that of jack bean α-mannosidase, which hydrolyzes Manα1-3Manβ faster than Manα1-6Manβ (7Oku H. Hase S. Ikenaka T. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Maley F. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1088-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Berman E. Allerhand A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6657-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, the trimannosyl core structure may be hydrolyzed initially by α-mannosidase, and then endo-β-mannosidase may act on the resulting Manα1-6Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc structure. Judging from the substrate specificities of endo-β-mannosidase along with plant α-mannosidase, both enzymes are presumably involved in N-glycan processing and/or degradation in plant cells. In mammalian cells, lysosomal α-mannosidase, which specifically hydrolyzes Manα1-6Manβ, has been found (33DeGasperi R. Daniel P.F. Warren C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9706-9712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hydrolase can compensate for the deficiency of an endo-β-mannosidase in terms of processing and/or degradation of the trimannosyl core structure. Identification of the A. thaliana gene encoding endo-β-mannosidase has enabled us to analyze the function of this enzyme. A gene knock-out study in A. thaliana will provide clues to the function of endo-β-mannosidase in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2049814848,"The minimal protein requirements that drive virus-like particle formation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been established. The C-terminal domain of capsid (CTD-CA) and nucleocapsid (NC) are the most important domains in a so-called minimal Gag protein (mGag). The CTD is essential for Gag oligomerization. NC is known to bind and encapsidate HIV-1 genomic RNA. The spacer peptide, SP1, located between CA and NC is important for the multimerization process, viral maturation and recognition of HIV-1 genomic RNA by NC. In this study, we show that NC in the context of an mGag protein binds HIV-1 genomic RNA with almost 10-fold higher affinity. The protein region encompassing the 11th α-helix of CA and the proposed α-helix in the CA/SP1 boundary region play important roles in this increased binding capacity. Furthermore, sequences downstream from stem loop 4 of the HIV-1 genomic RNA are also important for this RNA-protein interaction. In gel shift assays using purified mGag and a model RNA spanning the region from +223 to +506 of HIV-1 genomic RNA, we have identified an early complex (EC) formation between 2 proteins and 1 RNA molecule. This EC was not present in experiments performed with a mutant mGag protein, which contains a CTD dimerization mutation (M318A). These data suggest that the dimerization interface of the CTD plays an important role in EC formation, and, as a consequence, in RNA-protein association and multimerization. We propose a model for the RNA-protein interaction, based on previous results and those presented in this study."
https://openalex.org/W1967266546,"The regulation of adherens junction formation in cells of mesenchymal lineage is of critical importance in tumorigenesis but is poorly characterized. As actin filaments are crucial components of adherens junction assembly, we studied the role of gelsolin, a calcium-dependent, actin severing protein, in the formation of N-cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesions. With a homotypic, donor-acceptor cell model and plates or beads coated with recombinant N-cadherin-Fc chimeric protein, we found that gelsolin spatially co-localizes to, and is transiently associated with, cadherin adhesion complexes. Fibroblasts from gelsolin-null mice exhibited marked reductions in kinetics and strengthening of N-cadherin-dependent junctions when compared with wild-type cells. Experiments with lanthanum chloride (250 microm) showed that adhesion strength was dependent on entry of calcium ions subsequent to N-cadherin ligation. Cadherin-associated gelsolin severing activity was required for localized actin assembly as determined by rhodamine actin monomer incorporation onto actin barbed ends at intercellular adhesion sites. Scanning electron microscopy showed that gelsolin was an important determinant of actin filament architecture of adherens junctions at nascent N-cadherin-mediated contacts. These data indicate that increased actin barbed end generation by the severing activity of gelsolin associated with N-cadherin regulates intercellular adhesion strength."
https://openalex.org/W2068253308,"The half-ABC transporter Mdl1 is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria and mediates the export of peptides generated upon proteolysis of mitochondrial proteins. The physiological role of the peptides released from mitochondria is currently not understood. Here, we have analyzed the oligomeric state of Mdl1 in the inner membrane and demonstrate nucleotide-dependent binding to the F1F0-ATP synthase. Mdl1 forms homo-oligomeric, presumably dimeric complexes in the presence of ATP, but was found in association with the F1F0-ATP synthase at low ATP levels. Mdl1 binds membrane-embedded parts of the ATP synthase complex after the assembly of the F1 and F0 moieties. Although independent of Mdl1 activity, complex formation is impaired upon inhibition of the F1F0-ATP synthase with oligomycin or N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. These results are consistent with an activation of Mdl1 upon dissociation from the ATP synthase and suggest a link of peptide export from mitochondria to the activity of the F1F0-ATP synthase and the cellular energy metabolism. The half-ABC transporter Mdl1 is localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria and mediates the export of peptides generated upon proteolysis of mitochondrial proteins. The physiological role of the peptides released from mitochondria is currently not understood. Here, we have analyzed the oligomeric state of Mdl1 in the inner membrane and demonstrate nucleotide-dependent binding to the F1F0-ATP synthase. Mdl1 forms homo-oligomeric, presumably dimeric complexes in the presence of ATP, but was found in association with the F1F0-ATP synthase at low ATP levels. Mdl1 binds membrane-embedded parts of the ATP synthase complex after the assembly of the F1 and F0 moieties. Although independent of Mdl1 activity, complex formation is impaired upon inhibition of the F1F0-ATP synthase with oligomycin or N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. These results are consistent with an activation of Mdl1 upon dissociation from the ATP synthase and suggest a link of peptide export from mitochondria to the activity of the F1F0-ATP synthase and the cellular energy metabolism. Whereas the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are imported into the organelle after their synthesis in the cytosol, a small number of proteins is encoded within the mitochondrial genome. These polypeptides represent essential subunits of respiratory chain complexes, the F1F0-ATP synthase and mitochondrial ribosomes. The assembly and activity of these multiprotein complexes therefore depend on the coordinated expression of both the mitochondrial as well as the nuclear genome. Increasing evidence suggests the existence of multiple regulatory circuits allowing the adjustment of nuclear and organellar gene expression to different environmental conditions (1Parikh V.S.

Cell. 2003; 12: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Non-assembled membrane proteins, which may accumulate due to an imbalanced synthesis of mitochondrially and nuclearly encoded respiratory chain subunits, are rapidly removed by a ubiquitous and conserved quality control system in the inner membrane of mitochondria (7Arnold I. Langer T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Bota D.A. Davies K.J.A. Mitochondrion. 2001; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Key components of this system are two ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA) 1The abbreviations used are: AAA, ATPases associated with various cellular activities; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; TAP, mammalian transporter associated with antigen presentation; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ATPγS, 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; BN-PAGE, blue native gel electrophoresis; DCCD (N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide).1The abbreviations used are: AAA, ATPases associated with various cellular activities; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; TAP, mammalian transporter associated with antigen presentation; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ATPγS, 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; BN-PAGE, blue native gel electrophoresis; DCCD (N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide). proteases, ATP-dependent proteolytic complexes that expose their catalytic sites to the matrix or intermembrane space, respectively. According to a well accepted view, AAA proteases extract substrate proteins from the membrane bilayer and mediate their proteolytic breakdown to peptides (9Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Leonhard K. Guiard B. Pellechia G. Tzagoloff A. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These peptides are subsequently degraded to amino acids, presumably due to the action of yet largely unknown oligopeptidases within mitochondria (11Desautels M. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1869-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Strikingly, peptides and amino acids generated upon degradation of non-assembled mitochondrially encoded polypeptides in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were recently found to be released from mitochondria (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A large number of carrier proteins are present in the inner membrane, some of which were demonstrated to act as amino acid transporters (13Wipf D. Ludewig U. Tegeder M. Rentsch D. Koch W. Frommer W.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 139-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Peptides, on the other hand, are exported from mitochondria along two pathways: peptides generated by the i-AAA protease in the intermembrane space can traverse the outer membrane presumably through porins or protein-translocating translocase of the outer membrane complexes; peptides generated by the m-AAA protease in the matrix space, on the other hand, have first to be transported across the inner membrane. This transport process requires ATP hydrolysis and is driven by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter Mdl1 (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). ABC transporters comprise a large superfamily of membrane proteins that mediate the energy-dependent transfer of a variety of compounds across biological membranes. Three ABC transporter proteins have been identified in the inner membrane of yeast mitochondria, whereas at least four appear to be present in mammalian mitochondria (14Lill R. Kispal G. Holland B.I. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins from Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, Amsterdam2003: 515-531Google Scholar). All mitochondrial ABC proteins are half transporters, which expose their ABC domain to the matrix and therefore most likely function as export molecules. However, little is known about the transported solutes. Yeast Atm1 (and presumably its human orthologues ABCB7/ABC7 and ABCB6/MTABC3) is required for the synthesis of cytosolic but not mitochondrial Fe-S proteins and therefore was proposed to mediate the export of preassembled Fe-S clusters from mitochondria (15Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Mdl1, on the other hand, is the closest homologue of the mammalian transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP), which mediates the transport of antigenic peptides from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (16Dean M. Allikmets R. Gerrard B. Stewart C. Kistler A. Shafer B. Michaelis S. Strathern J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Schmitt L. Tampe R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In agreement with this sequence similarity, deletion of MDL1 impaired peptide export from the matrix space indicating that Mdl1, as TAP, functions as a peptide transporter (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Both ABC transporters appear to exhibit a similar length preference for peptides consisting of ∼6–20 amino acids (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17Schmitt L. Tampe R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Notably, Mdl2, a second yeast mitochondrial ABC transporter with high sequence similarity to TAP (16Dean M. Allikmets R. Gerrard B. Stewart C. Kistler A. Shafer B. Michaelis S. Strathern J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), did not affect peptide transport across the inner membrane in these experiments, neither in the presence nor in the absence of Mdl1 (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The mammalian orthologue of Mdl1 still remains to be identified. Human ABCB8 (M-ABC 1) (18Hogue D.L. Liu L. Ling V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and ABCB10 (M-ABC 2) (19Zhang F. Hogue D.L. Liu L. Fisher C.L. Hui D. Childs S. Ling V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as well as murine ABC-me share highest sequence similarity to Mdl1, but only the function of ABC-me has been analyzed in some detail (20Shirihai O.S. Gregory T. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Weiss M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2492-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). High expression levels of ABC-me in erythroid tissues and the observed enhanced hemoglobin synthesis upon overexpression of ABC-me in erythroleukemia cells are consistent with a role of this ABC transporter during heme biosynthesis (20Shirihai O.S. Gregory T. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Weiss M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2492-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because peptide export from mitochondria is only partly impaired in yeast cells lacking Mdl1, it is not surprising that these cells did not show a severe growth phenotype under non-stressed conditions. However, the function of Mdl1 has recently been linked to cellular resistance toward oxidative stress, because an increased sensitivity to oxidative agents has been observed upon overexpression of Mdl1 (21Chloupkova M. LeBard L.S. Koeller D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this observation and its link to the peptide export function of Mdl1 remain to be examined. However, it may provide an explanation for the unexpected finding that overexpression of Mdl1 partially suppresses deficiencies of Δatm1 cells in mitochondrial iron homeostasis (21Chloupkova M. LeBard L.S. Koeller D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To further characterize the function of Mdl1 within mitochondria, we have analyzed different assembly states of Mdl1 in the inner membrane. We demonstrate that Mdl1 forms homo-dimeric complexes and assembles in a nucleotide-dependent manner with monomeric F1F0-ATP synthase. Assembly depends on the activity of the ATP synthase but is independent of the ATPase activity of Mdl1. These results are consistent with an activation of Mdl1 upon dissociation from the ATP synthase and link peptide export from mitochondria to the cellular energy metabolism. Yeast Strains and Cloning Procedures—Yeast strains used in this study are derivatives of W303. Δyta10, Δyta12, yta10E559Qyta12E614Q and various mdl1 mutant strains were described elsewhere (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Arlt H. Steglich G. Perryman R. Guiard B. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4837-4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For isolation of mitochondria cells were grown at 30 °C on YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) containing 2% galactose and 0.5% lactate or on minimal medium (0.7% yeast nitrogen base containing ammonium sulfate) supplemented with the auxotrophic requirements (23Ausubel F.J. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1992Google Scholar). A yeast mutant strain expressing a C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged variant of Mdl1 from the endogenous promoter was generated by PCR-targeted homologous recombination. The primer pair 5′-GAA AAG GGG GAG TGA TAG ATT TGG ACA ATA GTG TTG CCC GGG AAG TAC ATC ACC ATC ACC ATC AC-3′ and 5′-GTG TAA ATT ACA TTG GGC ATC ATT TAA ATT ATA GAA TAC ACA ATT TCG TGC CAA GCT TTT TCT TTC C-3′ was used for amplification of the cassette gene from the template pSBB13–6his-URA3. The obtained PCR product was transformed into wild type cells thereby generating the strain YDG2. Homologous recombination was verified by PCR. Protein Import into Isolated Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated as previously described (24Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis D.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 538-544Google Scholar). After in vitro transcription of MDL1 using SP6 polymerase, precursor proteins were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine and imported into mitochondria for 30 min at 25 °C as described previously (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 25Wagner I. Arlt H. van Dyck L. Langer T. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Non-imported preproteins were digested with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. ATP-dependent Dimerization of Mdl1—After completion of protein import and protease digestion of non-imported precursor proteins, wild type and mdl1His mitochondria (500 μg) were solubilized at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in buffer H (200 mm KCl, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF) containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and, when indicated, 1 mm ATP or ATPγS. After a clarifying spin for 30 min at 90,000 × g, mitochondrial extracts were diluted to a final volume of 500 μl in buffer lacking detergent and loaded on Ni-NTA-agarose beads, which have been equilibrated in buffer H containing 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100 and, when indicated, 1 mm ATP or ATPγS. Samples were incubated for 2 h under gentle mixing. Agarose beads were spun down, washed twice with 500 μl of buffer H containing 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100, and once in addition imidazole (10 mm). Bound material was eluted with 100 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Gel Filtration Analysis—Mitochondria (600 μg of protein) were solubilized at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in buffer T (0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm PMSF, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) that was supplemented with 1 mm ATP when indicated. After incubation for 15 min at 4 °C under vigorous mixing, mitochondrial extracts were centrifuged for 30 min at 90,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a Superose 6 column equilibrated with buffer T containing only 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100 and, when indicated, 1 mm ATP. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 12%, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Mdl1 was detected in the eluate fractions by immunoblotting using an affinity-purified antibody directed against the C-terminal region of Mdl1 (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The following proteins were used as standards for calibration: Hsp60 (840 kDa, 12.5 ml), thyroglobulin (669 kDa, 13 ml), apoferritin (443 kDa, 14 ml), cytochrome b2 (212 kDa, 15 ml), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa, 15.5 ml), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, 16.5 ml). Affinity Purification of Mdl1 Complexes by Ni-NTA Chromatography—Mitochondria (20 mg) were solubilized at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in buffer T containing 20 mm imidazole. 1 mg of mitochondria was used in routine experiments to monitor Mdl1 complex formation. After a clarifying spin of the mitochondrial extract for 30 min at 90,000 × g the supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap™ Chelating HP column (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer T containing only 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 20 mm imidazole. The column was thoroughly washed, and bound material was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (12 ml) ranging from 25 to 500 mm. Fractions (0.5 ml) were diluted 5-fold and precipitated by adding 12% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting or Coomassie staining. Glycerol Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Mitochondria (450 μg) were solubilized at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in buffer T supplemented with 10% glycerol for 15 min at 4 °C under vigorous mixing. After a clarifying spin for 30 min at 90,000 × g the supernatant was fractionated by ultracentrifugation (3 h, 200,000 × g) through a linear glycerol gradient (4 ml) of 10–30%. Fractions (400 μl) were harvested from the top of the gradient. After precipitation with 12% trichloroacetic acid, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Mitochondria were solubilized at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in 0.5% Triton X-100, and extracts were analyzed by BN-PAGE using a 3–13% gradient gel essentially as described (26Schägger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mdl1-containing Protein Complexes in the Inner Membrane—Mdl1 is part of a protein complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane with an apparent molecular mass of ∼250 kDa (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), which may correspond to a dimeric form of the half-size ABC transporter Mdl1. To examine a potential homo-dimerization of Mdl1, the chromosomal MDL1 gene was modified in such a way that a hexahistidine peptide was fused to the C terminus of Mdl1 (Mdl1His). Mitochondria were then isolated from these cells and used for in vitro protein import experiments. Mdl1 was synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine and post-translationally imported into wild type and mdl1His mitochondria (Fig. 1A). In agreement with previous findings, import of Mdl1 occurred in a membrane potential-dependent manner and was accompanied by proteolytic removal of the mitochondrial targeting sequence (Fig. 1A). After completion of import, mitochondria were solubilized with Triton X-100, and extracts were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose beads. Newly imported Mdl1 was bound and specifically eluted upon addition of imidazole when mdl1His mitochondria were analyzed indicating an interaction with the endogenous, His-tagged Mdl1 variant (Fig. 1A). In contrast, radiolabeled Mdl1 was not precipitated from extracts of wild type mitochondria (Fig. 1A). Thus, newly imported Mdl1 assembles with pre-existing Mdl1 molecules and forms homo-oligomeric, most likely homo-dimeric complexes. To assess the role of nucleotides for dimerization, ATP levels within mitochondria were manipulated after completion of import and dimerization was examined by precipitation with Ni-NTA-agarose beads. At low mitochondrial ATP levels, newly imported Mdl1 was less efficiently bound to Mdl1His pointing to a nucleotide-dependent dimerization of Mdl1 (Fig. 1B). Assembly was restored upon addition of ATPγS and therefore is apparently independent of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 1B). The native molecular mass of Mdl1 was determined in the presence or absence of ATP in subsequent experiments. Mitochondria were isolated, solubilized in Triton X-100, and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. Mdl1 was detected in eluate fractions corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼250 kDa, if the fractionation was performed in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly, at low ATP levels a large fraction of Mdl1 was part of a ∼850 kDa complex within mitochondria (Fig. 2A). This effect appears to be specific to Mdl1, because the presence or absence of nucleotides did not affect the native molecular mass of Mdl2, which shares a sequence identity of 46% with Mdl1 (Fig. 2B). These findings demonstrate that Mdl1 is present in two forms in the mitochondrial inner membrane: at high ATP levels in a ∼250 kDa complex, which presumably represents a homodimeric state (also taking detergent effects into account), and, at low ATP levels, a ∼850 kDa complex with other mitochondrial inner membrane proteins. Requirement of the m-AAA Protease for Mdl1 Assembly— Mdl1 mediates the export of peptides from the mitochondrial matrix, which are generated upon proteolysis of inner membrane proteins by the m-AAA protease (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the absence of nucleotides, Mdl1 exhibited an apparent native molecular mass similar to the m-AAA protease raising the possibility of a physical interaction. We therefore analyzed complex formation of Mdl1 in Δyta10 and Δyta12 mitochondria lacking subunits of the m-AAA protease. Mitochondria were solubilized in the absence of ATP and extracted proteins were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3). In contrast to wild type mitochondria, Mdl1 was exclusively recovered from the column in fractions corresponding to a native molecular mass of ∼250 kDa (Fig. 3). Similarly, formation of the high molecular mass Mdl1-containing complex was strongly impaired upon coexpression of both Yta10E559Q and Yta12E614Q harboring point mutations in the proteolytic center in Δyta10Δyta12 mitochondria (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the assembly of Mdl1 into the high molecular mass complex depends on the m-AAA protease. The protease, however, does apparently not directly interact with the ABC transporter, because Mdl1 could not be precipitated with either Yta10- or Yta12-specific antisera (data not shown). Nucleotide-dependent Assembly of Mdl1 with the F1F0-ATP Synthase—To identify binding partners of Mdl1 in the inner membrane, we expressed a Mdl1 variant with a C-terminal hexahistidine peptide under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter in Δmdl1 cells. Mitochondria were isolated, solubilized in Triton X-100 in the absence of ATP, and subjected to metal chelating chromatography (Fig. 4). Bound material was eluted with imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In agreement with the coimmunoprecipitation experiments, Yta10 and Yta12 were not detected in the eluate. However, we observed a characteristic pattern of proteins specifically co-eluting with Mdl1 from the column, which was absent when mitochondrial extracts harboring similar levels of non-tagged Mdl1 were analyzed (Fig. 4A). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry identified several subunits of the F1F0-ATP synthase in the eluate fractions. These include α-, β-, and γ-subunits of the hydrophilic F1-ATPase and the stalk subunits 4, d, and oligomycin-sensitivity conferring protein (Fig. 4A). Moreover, subunit 6 of the F0 sector of the ATP synthase and the β-subunits of the F1-ATPase were detected immunologically in the eluate fraction (Fig. 4B). We examined the nucleotide dependence of the observed interaction to further substantiate its specificity. Wild type mitochondria and mitochondria harboring His-tagged Mdl1 were solubilized in the presence and absence of ATP and incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose beads. After elution of bound proteins with imidazole, fractions were analyzed immunologically with antiserum directed against the β-subunits of the F1-ATPase. In agreement with the gel filtration analysis, addition of ATP significantly diminished the amount of F1β coprecipitating with Mdl1His (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, F1β was not precipitated when wild type mitochondria were analyzed (Fig. 4C). In subsequent experiments, complex formation of Mdl1 with the F1F0-ATP synthase was examined by density gradient centrifugation. Triton X-100 extracts of mitochondria were fractionated through a glycerol gradient in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 4D). In agreement with the gel filtration experiments, Mdl1 was part of two complexes at low ATP levels, the larger form cofractionating with the F1F0-ATP synthase (Fig. 4D). In contrast, Mdl1 did not assemble with the F1F0-ATP synthase in the presence of ATP (Fig. 4D). Taken together, we conclude from these experiments that Mdl1 associates in a nucleotide-dependent manner with the F1F0-ATP synthase in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Control of F1F0-ATP Synthase Assembly by the m-AAA Protease—The m-AAA protease may be required for the biogenesis of the F1F0-ATP synthase as for other respiratory chain complexes (22Arlt H. Steglich G. Perryman R. Guiard B. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4837-4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Paul M.F. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and thereby affect the assembly state of Mdl1 in the absence of nucleotides. We therefore examined the assembly of the F1F0-ATP synthase in mitochondria lacking the m-AAA protease. Wild type, Δyta10, Δyta12, and Δyta10Δyta12 mitochondria expressing both proteolytically inactive Yta10E559Q and Yta12E614Q were solubilized and analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) (26Schägger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The F1F0-ATP synthase complex was observed in wild type mitochondria using a polyclonal antiserum directed against the α-subunit of the F1-particle (Fig. 5A). In contrast, assembled F1F0-ATP synthase was not detectable in Δyta10 or Δyta12 and accumulated at significantly reduced levels in yta10E559Qyta12E614Q mitochondria under these conditions (Fig. 5A). The α-subunit formed a smaller complex in these mitochondria, which had an apparent molecular mass of ∼440 kDa and represents the F1-particle (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate that the m-AAA protease is required for the assembly of the F1 and F0 sectors of the ATP synthase. Binding of Mdl1 to the F0 Moiety of Assembled F1F0-ATP Synthase—In view of these findings, the requirement of the m-AAA protease for the formation of Mdl1-ATP synthase complexes at low ATP levels can be explained by binding of Mdl1 only to the assembled F1F0-ATP synthase. We therefore analyzed complex formation in Δatp10 and Δatp12 mitochondria lacking known assembly factors of the ATP synthase (28Ackermann S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Griffiths D.E. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tzagoloff A. Barrientos A. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19775-19780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were solubilized with Triton X-100 in the absence of ATP, and extracts were subjected to gel filtration analysis (Fig. 5B). In contrast to wild type mitochondria, the high molecular weight form of Mdl1 accumulated in significantly reduced amounts when Δatp10 mitochondria were analyzed (Fig. 5B). The detectable amount of Mdl1 present in the 850-kDa complex correlates with the presence of reduced amounts of assembled F1F0-ATP synthase in Δatp10 mitochondria (data not shown). Consistently, Mdl1 did not assemble into a 850-kDa complex in Δatp12 mitochondria, which lack any detectable F1F0-ATP synthase (Fig. 5B). We therefore conclude from these experiments that Mdl1 associates only with the assembled F1F0-ATP synthase. The F1-particle accumulates in Δatp10 mitochondria suggesting that Mdl1 binding occurs to the F0 moiety of the F1F0-ATP synthase. To further substantiate this conclusion, we examined complex formation of Mdl1 in mdl1-His cells overexpressing Mdl1His and lacking mitochondrial DNA (ρ0). The mitochondrially encoded F0-subunits ATP6, -8, and -9 are not expressed in these cells, whereas α- and β-subunits form catalytically active F1-particles. Mitochondria isolated from mdl1-His ρ+ and mdl1-His ρ0 cells were solubilized in Triton X-100, and extracts were subjected to metal chelating chromatography. Bound material was eluted with imidazole and analyzed by immunoblotting using polyclonal antisera directed against the α-subunit of the F1-particle and Mdl1 (Fig. 5C). Whereas F1α was precipitated with Mdl1His in ρ+ mitochondria, it was not detected in ρ0 mitochondria (Fig. 5C). We conclude that the interaction of Mdl1 with the F1F0-ATP synthase depends on the presence of the F0 moiety. In agreement with this finding, membrane-embedded parts of Mdl1 appear to be required for complex formation. A C-terminal proteolytic fragment of Mdl1 harboring the ABC domain of the transporter protein did not cofractionate with the F1F0-ATP synthase upon glycerol gradient centrifugation or sizing chromatography under low ATP conditions (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Dimerization of the F1F0-ATP Synthase Is Not Required for Mdl1 Binding—A dimeric state of F1F0-ATP synthase complexes has been described that is characterized by the presence of three dimer-specific subunits (31Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We examined the association of Mdl1 with the F1F0-ATP synthase in mitochondria lacking subunit e (su e/Tim11/Atp21) or subunit g (su g/Atp20), which are both essential for dimerization of the F1F0-ATP synthase. The assembly state of Mdl1 in the inner membrane was assessed by gel filtration experiments. Mdl1 was found in association with the F1F0-ATP synthase at low ATP in Δsu e and in Δsu g mitochondria (Fig. 5D). The slightly reduced efficiency of Mdl1 binding reflects most likely the reduced stability of the F1F0-ATP synthase in these mitochondria (31Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We conclude that dimerization of the F1F0-ATP synthase is not required for the association of Mdl1. Assembly of Mdl1 Is Modulated by the F1F0-ATP Synthase Activity—To further characterize the nucleotide dependence of the observed interaction, we analyzed the association of F1F0-ATP synthase with Mdl1-mutant variants carrying point mutations in conserved motifs of the ABC nucleotide binding domains. Replacement of glycine 467 in the P-loop by valine (Mdl1G467V), aspartate 598 in the Walker B-motif by alanine (Mdl1D598A), or serine 575 in the C-loop by asparagine (Mdl1S575N) abolished Mdl1-mediated peptide export from mitochondria (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 extracts of mdl1G467V, mdl1D598A, and mdl1S575N mitochondria were fractionated at different ATP levels by sizing chromatography (Fig. 6). Whereas the Mdl1 variants were part of a complex of ∼250 kDa in the presence of ATP, they assembled, as wild type Mdl1 (Fig. 2A), with the F1F0-ATP synthase and eluted from the column in fractions corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼850 kDa under low ATP conditions (Fig. 6). Thus, the apparently increased binding affinity of Mdl1 for the F1F0-ATP synthase under these conditions does not depend on ATP binding or hydrolysis by Mdl1. To examine a potential role of the F1F0-ATP synthase activity, Mdl1 binding was examined by gel filtration after inhibition of the ATP synthase with oligomycin or DCCD (N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) (Fig. 7). Both oligomycin and DCCD prevented the association of Mdl1 with the F1F0-ATP synthase under low ATP conditions demonstrating that complex formation depends on the activity of the ATP synthase (Fig. 7). Surprisingly, we observed a reversed nucleotide dependence of Mdl1 binding to the oligomycin-inhibited F1F0-ATP synthase complex: whereas inhibition of the F1F0-ATP synthase with oligomycin impaired assembly with Mdl1 under low ATP conditions, part of Mdl1 co-eluted with the oligomycin-inhibited F1F0-ATP synthase in the presence of ATP (Fig. 7, A and B). We conclude from these experiments that complex formation is independent of the activity of Mdl1 but dependent on the F1F0-ATP synthase activity. We have characterized the assembly state of the ABC transporter Mdl1 of mitochondria and identified two Mdl1-containing complexes in the inner membrane. Whereas Mdl1 forms a homo-dimer in the presence of ATP, it associates with the F1F0-ATP synthase at low ATP levels. Assembly occurs via membrane-embedded parts and is impaired upon inhibition of the F1F0-ATP synthase. Based on our results we suggest a model that couples Mdl1-mediated peptide export from mitochondria to the activity of the F1F0-ATP synthase: We propose that Mdl1 is bound in an inactive form to the F1F0-ATP synthase but activated upon dissociation from the complex. The affinity of Mdl1 for the F1F0-ATP synthase complex depends on the functional status of the ATP synthase. Under conditions of low F1F0-ATP synthase activity Mdl1 is released from the complex resulting in the activation of Mdl1-mediated peptide export from mitochondria. Several lines of evidence suggest that Mdl1 associated with the F1F0-ATP synthase is functionally inactive. Complex formation is not impaired by mutations in the ABC domain of Mdl1, which abolish peptide export (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, the nucleotide-dependent binding to the ATP synthase neither depends on the transport activity of Mdl1 nor is apparently controlled by ATP binding or hydrolysis by Mdl1. Whereas binding to the F1F0-ATP synthase occurs under low ATP conditions, Mdl1-mediated peptide export from mitochondria requires ATP hydrolysis (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The ATP dependence most likely reflects the energetic requirement of the transport process itself which is, as shown for other ABC transporters, driven by ATP-dependent conformational changes of ABC domains (32Sharom F.J. Holland B.I. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins from Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, Amsterdam2003: 107-133Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed a nucleotide-dependent homo-oligomerization of Mdl1 in the inner membrane suggesting that the half ABC transporter Mdl1 is functionally active as a homo-dimer. Consistently, assembly of Mdl1 with two other mitochondrial half ABC transporter molecules, Mdl2 and Atm1, has been excluded (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Chloupkova M. LeBard L.S. Koeller D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). ATP binding was sufficient to promote homo-dimerization of Mdl1, which is in agreement with recent in vitro studies on the purified nucleotide-binding domain of Mdl1 (33Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In view of the nucleotide-dependent dimerization of Mdl1, it is an attractive possibility that the observed complex with the F1F0-ATP synthase at low ATP levels involves monomeric Mdl1. However, dimerization of Mdl1 apparently does not exclude an association with the F1F0-ATP synthase. Replacement of glutamate 599 of Mdl1 by glutamine did not abolish complex formation with the F1F0-ATP synthase, 2D. Galluhn and T. Langer, unpublished observations. although it has been reported to stabilize purified ABC domains of Mdl1 in a dimeric state (33Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We observed a strict dependence of complex formation on the activity of the F1F0-ATP synthase. Mdl1 binding was abolished in the presence of the ATP synthase inhibitors oligomycin or DCCD. It is therefore conceivable that the observed nucleotide dependence reflects different binding affinities of Mdl1 for different conformational states of the ATP synthase complex. Alternatively, inhibitor binding to F0-subunits might directly interfere with the association of Mdl1. This might provide an explanation for the unexpected finding that oligomycin but not DCCD promotes Mdl1 binding in the presence of ATP. In agreement with the observed dependence on F1F0-ATP synthase activity, Mdl1 binding requires the assembly of F1 and F0 moieties of the ATP synthase complex. Mdl1 did not accumulate in a high molecular weight complex in mitochondria lacking Atp10 or Atp12, which both control the assembly of the ATP synthase (28Ackermann S.H. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9952-9959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bowman S. Ackerman S.H. Griffiths D.E. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7517-7523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), even though the F1 particle accumulates in Δatp10 mitochondria. Consistently, Mdl1 did not assemble with the F1 particle in ρ0 mitochondria, which lack mitochondrially encoded F0-subunits resulting in a destabilization of the F0 moiety of the ATP synthase. Similar to Atp10, the m-AAA protease was found to be required for the assembly of the F1 and F0 moieties of the ATP synthase. Although a direct effect of the m-AAA protease on the oligomeric state of Mdl1 cannot be excluded, its role for the assembly of the F1F0-ATP synthase is sufficient to explain the lack of the high molecular weight form of Mdl1 in mitochondria lacking the m-AAA protease. Oligomerization of the yeast ATP synthase has recently been linked to cristae morphogenesis and inner membrane organization (34Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Mdl1 binding to the F1F0-ATP synthase might therefore serve to recruit Mdl1 to specialized subcompartments within the inner membrane. However, the dependence of complex formation on the activity of the F1F0-ATP synthase makes this possibility unlikely. Consistently, while dependent on the assembly of the F1 and F0 moieties, the association of Mdl1 does not require oligomerization of the F1F0-ATP synthase and was observed in mitochondria lacking the dimer-specific subunits e and g. What is the function of the nucleotide-dependent association of Mdl1 with the F1F0-ATP synthase? Because ATP synthase complexes are most likely in large molar excess over Mdl1 in the inner membrane, regulation of their activity by Mdl1 binding appears unlikely. Consistently, neither deletion nor overexpression of Mdl1 affected the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity in mitochondria. 2D. Galluhn and T. Langer, unpublished observations. Similarly, we do not favor the possibility that binding to the F1F0-ATP synthase represents an obligatory step during the transport cycle of Mdl1, because oligomycin abolished assembly with the ATP synthase but did not affect peptide export (12Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We rather propose a regulatory role of the observed reversible association and an activation of Mdl1-mediated peptide export upon dissociation from the F1F0-ATP synthase. Regardless, our results provide for the first time a glimpse toward the cellular role of mitochondrial peptide export and link Mdl1 function to F1F0-ATP synthase activity and thereby to the cellular energy metabolism. We thank Dr. I. Arnold for fruitful discussions and critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2090260969,"Despite the early expression of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in the retina, not much is known about their regulation and involvement in plasticity processes during retinal development and synapse formation. Here we report that NMDAR function in the inner retina is developmentally regulated and controlled by ambient light condition. A prominent down-regulation after eye opening of NMDAR function was observed in rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which was prevented by dark rearing the animals for 1 month but was again induced by subsequent light exposure. As shown by molecular analysis of single RGCs, alterations in the subunit composition of NMDAR did not account for the light-dependent regulation of NMDAR function. Immunocytochemistry showed no differences in the NMDAR protein expression pattern between normal and dark-reared animals. In conclusion, our data clearly demonstrate that NMDAR function is modulated during periods of retinal plasticity independent of structural alterations in its subunit composition and thus different from mechanisms observed in higher visual centers."

The SAgs share widely different levels of sequence identity. Some are so similar (for example SEA and SEE, with ∼ 90% sequence identity) as to make allelic variants between different strains difficult to distinguish, but many share much lower sequence identity, around 20%. Structurally, however, the SAgs share a highly conserved fold (8Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Structure. 1997; 5: 991-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Arcus V.L. Proft T. Sigrell J.A. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), comprising an N-terminal β-barrel domain with the well known OB-fold (10Murzin A.G.

Most SAgs (for example SEB and TSST-1) have a single MHC-II-binding site, located on their N-terminal domains (12Kim J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C.

Proft T. Sigrell J.A. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Still others, such as SEA, have both sites (15Hudson K.R.

A variation on this theme is given by several other SAgs, including SED and SPE-C, which can cross-link MHC-II by formation of homodimers. Thus, SED forms zinc-dependent homodimers through its C-terminal domain and can cross-link MHC-II through the N-terminal domain sites at each end of the homodimer (18Sundstrom M. Abrahmsen L. Antonsson P. Mehindate K. Mourad W. Dohlsten M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SPE-C dimerizes via its N-terminal domain and can cross-link MHC-II by the two C-terminal domain Zn2+ sites of the dimer (19Roussel A. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In contrast to the varied MHC-II-binding modes, the evidence so far suggests that most, if not all, SAgs bind to TCR via a common site, at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains (20Fields B.A. Malchiodi E.L.

The ability to select particular TCR Vβ subtypes appears to derive from sequence and structural diversity on the TCR, coupled with local SAg sequence variation at a common TCR-binding site.Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin J (SPE-J) was first identified from the S. pyogenes genome sequence (22Proft T. Moffatt S.L. Berkhan C.J. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein has been shown to be a highly potent mitogen, giving half-maximum responses at 0.1 pg/ml. In terms of sequence, SPE-J is most closely related to SPE-C (49% identity), and it appears to be functionally indistinguishable; its T-cell specificity is the same (for Vβ2.1), and like SPE-C (23Li P.L. Tiedemann R.E. Moffatt S.L. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) it forms homodimers and induces rapid homotypic aggregation of LG-2 cells, implying an ability to cross-link MHC-II (24Proft T. Arcus V.L. Handley V. Baker E.N. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6711-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This raises the question as to why a bacterial isolate should maintain two different genes that code for apparently functionally identical proteins.Here we show, from its high resolution crystal structure, that SPE-J forms a completely different dimer from that of SPE-C. Intriguingly, the interface used for dimerization proves to be the same as that used for TCR binding. This leads to the conclusion that SPE-J must bind to TCR as a monomer but that concentration-dependent dimerization allows it also to stimulate intracellular signaling in APCs by cross-linking MHC-II as a dimer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—SPE-J was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as described by Proft et al. (24Proft T. Arcus V.L. Handley V. Baker E.N. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6711-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The protein was overexpressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and was initially purified using glutathione/agarose. After cleavage of glutathione S-transferase from the toxin with protease 3c, the protein was further purified by cation exchange chromatography (MonoS HR 5/5 column, Amersham Biosciences) followed by gel filtration (Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column, Amersham Biosciences). Small fractions were taken across the protein peak, and dynamic light scattering (see below) was used to decide which fractions were to be taken for crystallization trials. Only those with a Cp/RH ratio of less than 14% were used.Light Scattering Analysis—Dynamic light scattering was performed by using a Protein Solutions (Charlottesville, VA) DynaPro molecular sizing instrument to determine not only the monodispersity of protein samples, prior to crystallization, but also to determine the relative molecular mass of the protein at various concentrations. Samples ranged in concentration from 0.8 to 12.0 mg/ml, and 30 measurements were made at each concentration.

Small shield-shaped crystals of maximum dimension of 0.03 mm grew over a period of 2–3 weeks. These crystals were monoclinic, space group C2, with unit cell dimensions a = 165.6, b = 46.4, c = 72.2 Å, β = 90.6°. This gave Vm values of 3.0 Å3/Da (59% solvent) assuming two molecules per asymmetric unit, or 2.0 Å3/Da (39% solvent) assuming three molecules per asymmetric unit; the structure determination showed the latter to be correct.Crystals of zinc-bound SPE-J (Zn-SPE-J) were obtained by soaking crystals in 100 mm zinc acetate, 20% PEG 3350, 230 mm lithium acetate, pH 5.8, for 1 h. This short, sharp soak gave much better diffraction than from crystals soaked in lower zinc acetate concentration (1 mm) for a longer period (4–24 h). Crystals were mounted in a cryoloop and flash-frozen by plunging into liquid N2 after a rapid pass through a cryoprotectant solution. The latter comprised 0.23 m lithium acetate, 18% PEG 3350, and 20% ethylene glycol, pH 5.8, for SPE-J and 100 mm zinc acetate, 0.23 m lithium acetate, 20% PEG 3350, and 20% ethylene glycol, pH 5.8, for Zn-SPE-J.Data Collection—X-ray diffraction data to 1.7 Å resolution were collected for SPE-J at 110 K at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. Zn-SPE-J data to 2.0-Å resolution were collected at 110 K using CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU-H3R x-ray generator equipped with Osmic mirrors, an Oxford cryostream, and a Mar345 imaging plate system. Raw data were processed using MOSFLM (25Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1992; 55: 1696-1702Crossref Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and scaled and merged with SCALA (26Evans P.R. Sawyer L.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of SPE-J was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) with the closely related SAg structure SPE-C (19Roussel A. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. Nature Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1AN8), as search model; SPE-J and SPE-C share 49% sequence identity. Two molecules were found and used for phasing to 2.0 Å resolution, after which an initial model was built with ARP/wARP (28Perrakis A. Morris R.J. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). This gave an almost complete model for both molecules (391 of 422 residues) and also revealed the position of a third molecule, which was added to the model. Further refinement was with CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar), with cycles of refinement being interspersed with manual model building into the electron density using the graphics program TURBO FRODO (30Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1998: 77-79Google Scholar). Solvent molecules, all treated as water, were added using the WATERPICK facility in CNS and were retained if they had spherical density and appropriate hydrogen bond geometry. The quality of the model was checked periodically with PROCHECK (31Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and hydrogen bonds were identified following the distance and angle criteria of Baker and Hubbard (32Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). The Zn-SPE-J structure was solved using the final SPE-J structure as a starting model and was refined in the same way.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Single-site mutants of SPE-J were generated by overlap PCR. Oligonucleotide primers pGEX.fw/SpeJmut.rev and pGEX.rev/SpeJmut.fw were used for 12 cycles of PCR with pGEX-3c:speJ (24Proft T. Arcus V.L. Handley V. Baker E.N. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6711-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as template. See supplemental Material for primer sequences. The PCR products were then purified from agarose gels and used as templates for 18 cycles of PCR with pGEX.fw/pGEX.rev primer pairs. The PCR products were cloned into pGEX-3c vectors, and the recombinant SPE-J mutant proteins were produced as described previously for wild type SPE-J (24Proft T. Arcus V.L. Handley V. Baker E.N. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6711-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of the cloned SPE-J mutants were confirmed using a Licor automated DNA sequencer (model 4200).Toxin Proliferation Assay—The mitogenic activity of the SPE-J mutants was determined in a peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) stimulation assay as described previously (22Proft T. Moffatt S.L. Berkhan C.J. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In brief, PBLs were purified from blood of healthy donors and incubated with varying dilutions of SPE-J mutants (100 ng/ml to 1 fg/ml). After 3 days of incubation at 37 °C, 0.1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added. After another 24 h, the PBLs were harvested and counted on a Cobra scintillation counter. The decrease in T-cell mitogenicity was calculated as the amount of mutant toxin needed to achieve half-maximum stimulation (P50 value) of wild type SPE-J.RESULTSCrystal Structure of SPE-J—The three-dimensional structure of SPE-J was determined by molecular replacement and refined at 1.75 Å resolution to an R factor of 0.209 and free R factor of 0.240. The model has excellent geometry with 87.2% of non-glycine residues falling in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, as defined in PROCHECK (31Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), with no outliers. The three molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal are organized in such a way that A and B form a putative dimer (see below) and C also forms a dimer, with another molecule C, related by 2-fold crystallographic symmetry. The final model for molecule A comprises the complete polypeptide for mature SPE-J, residues 1–209, but with two additional residues (Gly-2 and Ser-1) also modeled at the N terminus, left after cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase fusion domain. Sequence numbering here follows that of the mature protein. Molecule B lacks residues 97–101, and molecule C lacks residues –2, –1 and 1; these have no interpretable electron density and are assumed to be disordered. Further details are given in Table II.Molecular Structure—SPE-J has the characteristic two-domain SAg fold (8Papageorgiou A.C. Acharya K.R. Structure. 1997; 5: 991-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Arcus V.L. Proft T. Sigrell J.A. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), shown in Fig. 1. Following an N-terminal helix α2 (residues 2–17), which ends in the inter-domain cleft, the N-terminal OB-fold domain has a β-barrel structure comprising five highly curved β-strands, β1 to β5, which create a concave outer surface that is used in many SAgs for MHC-II binding. The C-terminal β-grasp domain is based on a mixed, five-stranded, β-sheet that wraps around a central α-helix, α4 (residues 128–145). When SPE-J is compared with other SAgs by using the program SSM (www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-src/ssm/), its closest homolog is SPE-C, with which it shares 49% sequence identity and 199 residues that can be matched with a root mean square (r.m.s.) difference in Cα positions of 1.24 Å. This gives a Z score of 14.8, with the only significant differences in the polypeptide chain conformation being in the β5-β6 loop, where a single residue (Asn-96) is inserted in SPE-J and small changes in strand β7 and the β4-β5 and β10-α5 loops. The next closest hits are SMEZ-2 (Z score 11.0, 32% sequence identity, 196 Cα atoms matching with an r.m.s. difference of 1.41 Å) and SPE-H (Z score 9.0, 25% sequence identity, 182 Cα matching with an r.m.s. difference of 1.92 Å). These are all streptococcal SAgs.Molecular Packing, Evidence for Dimerization—Examination of the crystal packing shows that molecules A and B share a significant interface (Fig. 2), which is considerably more extensive than any of their other packing interactions in the crystal, and has many of the properties expected of a protein dimer. This interface buries a total of 1360 Å2 of accessible surface area (680 Å2 per monomer, or 6.5% of the monomer surface), calculated using the Protein-Protein Interaction Server (www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server); this uses the algorithm of Lee and Richards (33Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5310) Google Scholar) with a probe radius of 1.4 Å. The interface is formed by the C-terminal half of helix α2 and its connection to strand β1, the β2-β3 loop, the β4-β5 loop, all from the N-terminal domain, and the end of helix α4 and start of helix α5, both from the C-terminal domain. The residues that make the greatest contribution to the interface are Tyr-14, Glu-17, and Ile-19 from α2, Phe-77, Arg-79, and Tyr-83 from β4-β5, Gln-142 from α4, and Arg-181 from the start of α5, which hydrogen bonds across the interface to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-17.Fig. 2Dimerization of SpeJ. Stereo view of the SPE-J dimer, with the two molecules shown in blue and yellow. Side chains that make significant contributions to the dimer interface are shown in red, with the major contributors labeled: Y, Tyr-14; I, Ile-19; F, Phe-77; and R, Arg-181. The C-terminal domain in each monomer provides the binding site for the zinc ion (gray sphere) that binds to MHC-II. Fig. drawn with MOLSCRIPT (43Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The third molecule in the asymmetric unit, molecule C, forms a very similar interaction with another molecule C, related by crystallographic symmetry. The dimerization of these two molecules buries a somewhat larger surface area of 2130 Å2 (1065 Å2 per monomer, 10.4% of the monomer surface). The structural elements that comprise it are the same as for the A-B dimer, however, involving residues in and around the interdomain cleft (Fig. 2). The principal contributors to the interface are Tyr-14, Glu-17, and Ile-19 from α2, Tyr-43, Lys-44, and Lys-45 from β2-β3, Phe-77, Tyr-80, and Tyr-83 from β4-β5, Gln-142 from α4, and Arg-181 from α5. In both the A-B and C-C dimers there are 6–10 direct protein-protein hydrogen bonds across the interface, and a number of water molecules make bridging interactions.Zinc Binding—SPE-J has been shown to bind to MHC-II in a zinc-dependent manner. The native SPE-J structure contained no bound zinc, however, and of the three residues proposed to form the Zn2+-binding site (24Proft T. Arcus V.L. Handley V. Baker E.N. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6711-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the side chains of His-201 and Asp-203 were close together but that of the third putative ligand, His-167, was turned away. In the Zn-SPE-J structure, however, after soaking the crystals very briefly in 100 mm Zn2+, the side chain of His-167 had moved, and these three residues are bound to a fully occupied Zn2+ ion, with bond lengths of 2.1–2.2 Å. A water molecule is bound as a fourth ligand, completing a tetrahedral coordination site. The zinc site is located on the concave surface of the C-terminal domain and is equally accessible for MHC-II binding in both the monomeric and dimeric forms of SPE-J dimer. In the latter the Zn atoms are ∼60 Å apart, at the two ends of the dimer.Functional Analysis of the TCR-binding Site in SPE-J— SPE-J is most closely related to SPE-C by amino acid sequence (49% identity) and, like SPE-C, primarily stimulates T-cells carrying the Vβ2 TCR (24Proft T. Arcus V.L. Handley V. Baker E.N. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6711-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We therefore selected for mutagenesis those residues in SPE-J that were equivalent to the SPE-C residues shown to contact Vβ in the TCR Vβ-SPE-C co-crystal structure (21Sundberg E.J. Li H. Llera A.S. McCormick J.K. Tormo J. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Structure. 2002; 10: 687-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Table III). The recombinant SPE-J mutant proteins were then analyzed for their mitogenicity in standard PBL proliferation assays. To ensure that any loss in proliferation activity was because of impaired TCR binding, MHC-II binding of the mutant proteins was confirmed in a standard binding assay (data not shown).Table IIITCR binding mutants of SPE-JSPE-CTCR interactionSPE-JSPE-J mutantsDecrease in mitogenicityH-bondVdWTyr-15++Tyr-14Y14A10,000-FoldThr-18(+)a(+) indicates hydrogen bonds involving only main chain atoms.+Glu-17E17A0Thr-20(+)+Ile-19I19A0Arg-45++Lys-44K44A10-FoldK46A0Tyr-49+-Phe-48F48A0Leu-78-+Phe-77F77A100-FoldAsn-79++Thr-78T78A2-FoldGlu-178-+Ser-178S178A0Arg-181+-Arg-181R181Q10,000-Folda (+) indicates hydrogen bonds involving only main chain atoms. Open table in a new tab The strongest decrease in potency for T-cell stimulation (10,000-fold) was observed with the Y14A and R181Q mutants, which correspond to SPE-C residues Tyr-15 and Arg-181, respectively. 10-Fold and 100-fold decreases in potency were detected with mutants K44A (Arg-45 in SPE-C) and F77A (Leu-78 in SPE-C), respectively. A minor difference was observed with T78A (Asn-79 in SPE-C), which had a 2-fold reduction in mitogenicity compared with wild type SPE-J. In contrast, the mutants E17A, I19A, K46A, F48A, and S178A showed no differences to wild type SPE-J in proliferation (Table III).DISCUSSIONSolution studies, using dynamic light scattering, show clearly that SPE-J forms dimers at higher protein concentrations (>3 mg/ml) and in fact has a somewhat greater propensity for dimerization than SPE-C. In contrast, another SAg, SMEZ-2, showed only monomers under the same conditions. SPE-J was also shown to stimulate the rapid aggregation of LG-2 cells, presumably by cross-linking of MHC-II molecules (24Proft T. Arcus V.L. Handley V. Baker E.N. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6711-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Further functional studies indicate that SPE-J binds to MHC-II only through the C-terminal zinc site that it shares with other zinc-dependent SAgs (24Proft T. Arcus V.L. Handley V. Baker E.N. Fraser J.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6711-6719Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the conclusion must be that, as in the case of SPE-C (23Li P.L. Tiedemann R.E. Moffatt S.L. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it is its ability to form dimers that enables SPE-J to cross-link MHC-II.The mode of dimerization found in our SPE-J crystals was a surprise, howev"

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ideal model protein for studying how mutations disrupt folding of ATP-binding cassette proteins such as CFTR because specific chemical chaperones can be used to correct folding defects. Interactions between the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) are critical because ATP binds at the interface between the NBDs. Here, we used disulfide cross-linking between cysteines in the Walker A sites and the LSGGQ signature sequences to test whether processing mutations located throughout P-gp disrupted interactions between the NBDs. We found that mutations present in the cytoplasmic loops, transmembrane segments, and linker regions or deletion of Tyr-490 (equivalent to Phe-508 in CFTR) inhibited cross-linking between the NBDs. Deletion of Phe-508 in the P-gp/CFTR chimera also inhibited cross-linking between the NBDs. Cross-linking was restored, however, when the mutants were expressed in the presence of the chemical chaperone cyclosporin A. The “rescued” mutants exhibited drug-stimulated ATPase activity, and cross-linking between the NBDs was inhibited by vanadate trapping of nucleotide. These results together with our previous findings (Loo, T. W., Bartlett, M. C., and Clarke, D. M. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 27585–27588) indicate that processing mutations disrupt interactions among all four domains. It appears that cross-talk between the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domains is required for establishment of proper domain-domain interactions that occur during folding of ATP-binding cassette protein transporters.

Human CFTR has 1480 amino acids and acts as a cAMP-regulated chloride channel (1Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5811) Google Scholar). It is located at the surface of epithelial cells where it regulates salt and fluid transport across the cell membrane (2Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 3Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3729-3732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The most common CF-associated mutation (found on at least one chromosome of 90% of affected individuals) is deletion of phenylalanine 508 (ΔF508) in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) (1Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5811) Google Scholar). The ΔF508 mutation causes misfolding of the CFTR protein. The misfolded protein is not targeted correctly to the apical membrane and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum in an inactive form (4Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3797-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and is degraded rapidly (5Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 6Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The ΔF508 CFTR mutant, however, is temperature-sensitive because expression at lower temperatures promotes maturation and targeting to the cell surface in an active form (8Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 9Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Reyes E. Jensen T. Chang X. Rommens J.M. Bear C.E. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to understand how mutations such as ΔF508 interfere with the normal folding and maturation of CFTR. A useful model system for studying folding and maturation of CFTR is the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp is an ATP-dependent drug pump located in the plasma membrane. It transports a wide variety of structurally diverse compounds out of the cell (for review, see Ref. 10Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). P-gp and CFTR are members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters and are predicted to have similar structures. Both proteins have two NBDs and two transmembrane domains (TMDs), each of which contains six predicted transmembrane (TM) segments (11Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Mutations in P-gp at positions equivalent to those found in CFTRs of CF patients such as deletion of Tyr-490 (equivalent to Phe-508 in CFTR) also cause the mutant P-gps to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (13Hoof T. Demmer A. Hadam M.R. Riordan J.R. Tummler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20575-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The advantage of using P-gp for studying protein misfolding is that the processing defects in P-gp can be corrected by expressing the protein in the presence of drug substrates (chemical chaperones). The “rescued” mutant P-gps are transported to the cell surface in a functional form (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Also, the contact points between the various domains have been mapped through disulfide cross-linking analysis (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Knowledge about these contact points is essential because they can serve as “reporters” for providing important information about domain-domain interactions. We had shown that processing mutations affect maturation of ABC transporters by interfering with interaction between the TMDs. In this study, we tested whether processing mutations affected interactions between the NBDs. Construction of Mutants—Cys-less P-gp was constructed by changing the 7 endogenous cysteines at positions 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227 to alanines (12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19965-19972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the cysteines is needed for activity because the Cys-less P-gp retained activity (12Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The Cys-less P-gp cDNA was also modified to code for 10 histidine residues at the COOH end of the molecule (Cys-less P-gp-H-is10). P-gp mutants containing an endogenous cysteine in the Walker A sites (Cys-431 in NBD1 or Cys-1074 in NBD2) and a second cysteine in the LSGGQ signature sequence to yield mutant C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature) and L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NB-D2-Walker A) were described previously (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The processing mutation ΔY490 was introduced into mutant C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature), whereas processing mutations G268V, P709G, G722A, and A841L were introduced into mutant L531C(NBD1-signature)/C-1074(NBD2-Walker A). The oligonucleotide 5′-GCCACCACGATAAAAGAAAATCATCTTTGGCCGTGAAAATGTC-3′ was used to replace residues 483TIAENIRYG491 in P-gp with residues 501TIKENIIFG509 of CFTR (P-gp/CFTR chimera) (22Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). Phe-508 in the P-gp/CFTR chimera was then deleted with oligonucleotide 5′-ATAAAAGAAAATATCATCGGCCGTGAAAATGTCACC-3′ (17Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The integrity of the mutated cDNA was confirmed by sequencing the entire cDNA (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Expression, Purification, and Measurement of Drug-stimulated ATPase Activity—Expression of the cDNAs in HEK 293 cells and purification of histidine-tagged P-gp mutants have been described previously (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 10-cm-diameter culture plates of HEK 293 cells were transfected with the mutant cDNA, and the medium was replaced 24 h later with fresh medium containing 10 μm cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A is a substrate of P-gp and acts as a powerful chemical chaperone for promoting maturation of P-gp (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were then harvested 24 h later, solubilized with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and the mutant P-gp isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns, Qiagen, Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada). The P-gp-His10 mutants were eluted from the nickel columns with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, and mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml crude sheep brain lipid (type II-S; Sigma) that was washed and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. The P-gp:lipid mixture was then sonicated for 45 s at 4 °C (bath type probe, maximum setting, Branson Sonifier 450, Branson Ultrasonic, Danbury, CT). An aliquot of the sonicated P-gp:lipid mixture was assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity by the addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and saturating concentrations of verapamil (1 mm) or colchicine (10 mm). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined (26Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Cross-linking Analysis—For cross-linking analysis, HEK 293 cells expressing the mutant P-gps were grown in the presence or absence of 10 μm cyclosporin A. Membranes were prepared from transfected cells and suspended in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Samples were treated with 0.5 mm copper phenanthroline for 15 min at 20 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm in SDS sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 4% (w/v) SDS) that contained no disulfide-reducing agent. To test for the effect of ATP, membranes were prepared from cells expressing P-gp mutants that were grown in the presence of cyclosporin A and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 10 mm ATP and 15 mm MgCl2. The membranes were then subjected to oxidative cross-linking with 0.5 mm copper (phenanthroline)3 for 5 min at 20 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm EDTA, and the samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis To test for the effect of ATP plus vanadate, orthovanadate was prepared from Na3VO4 and boiled for 2 min to break down polymeric species (27Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The mutant membranes were incubated with 0.2 mm vanadate, 5 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C. Under these conditions, P-gp ATPase activity is inhibited by more than 90% (28Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cross-linked samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% acrylamide gels and immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibody (29Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Effect of the ΔY490 Mutation on Maturation and Activity of P-gp—P-gp is a typical ABC transporter because it is composed of four domains, two TMDs and NBDs that are joined together by a linker region (Fig. 1A). The two halves of the protein show 43% amino acid identity (11Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). The two halves of P-gp interact specifically and will associate with each other to form a functional complex when the two halves are expressed as separate polypeptides (30Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TMD1-TMD2 and NBD1-NBD2 interfaces are important because they form the common drug binding pocket (31Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and ATP binding sites, respectively (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Crystal structure studies of bacterial ABC transporters (32Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 33Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and cross-linking analysis of P-gp (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) show that the two ATP molecules bind at sites located between the Walker A site of one NBD and the LSGGQ signature sequence of the second NBD. In P-gp, the Walker A sites and the LSGGQ signature sequences of the two NBDs are quite close together because cysteines introduced into these sites can be directly cross-linked with oxidant (Fig. 1B). The ability to cross-link a cysteine in the Walker A site of one NBD with a cysteine in the LSGGQ signature sequence of the other NBD serves as a useful reporter molecule for monitoring the interactions between the NBDs. Accordingly, we tested whether the presence of processing mutations affected cross-linking between NBD1 and NBD2. Processing mutations cause the protein to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as a core-glycosylated 150-kDa protein that is degraded rapidly (34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale for this approach was that by knowing the contact points in the functional P-gp, we could determine whether mutations that cause protein misfolding interfere with the establishment of proper domain-domain interactions. The first processing mutant tested was ΔY490 in NBD1 (Fig. 1A). Residue Tyr-490 of P-gp is equivalent to Phe-508 in CFTR (13Hoof T. Demmer A. Hadam M.R. Riordan J.R. Tummler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20575-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, residue Tyr-490 was deleted in mutant C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature). The mutant was expressed in HEK 293 cells and expression detected by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 2A shows that in the absence of drug substrate, the deleted Tyr-490 residue inhibited maturation of P-gp such that the major product was a 150-kDa protein. Maturation of the mutant 150-kDa protein to the mature 170-kDa protein was restored when expression was carried out in the presence of the drug substrate cyclosporin A (Fig. 2A). We then determined whether mutant Y490/C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature) retained drug-stimulated ATPase activity. The histidine-tagged mutant was grown in the presence of cyclosporin A, isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography, mixed with lipid, and assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. The mutant retained 82 + 8% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of that of mutant C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature) (data not shown). Cross-linking analysis was then done on the misfolded and rescued forms of mutant P-gp. Membranes were prepared from cells expressing mutant ΔY490/C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature) that had been grown with or without 10 μm cyclosporin A and subjected to cross-linking with copper phenanthroline. Fig. 2B, right panel, shows that cross-linked product was detected only after expression of the mutant in the presence of cyclosporin A. By contrast, no cross-linked product was detected in membranes from cells that were not treated with drug substrate (Fig. 2B, left panel). To determine whether the mutant could still trap nucleotide in the presence of vanadate, the membranes were treated with ATP plus vanadate and then subjected to oxidative cross-linking. Fig. 2C shows that vanadate trapping of nucleotide inhibited cross-linking of the mutant. It was possible, however, that the immature P-gp may have been cross-linked but did not show a shift in electrophoretic mobility because of limited glycosylation of the immature product. To rule out this possibility, membranes were prepared from cells expressing mutant C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature) that were grown in the presence of cyclosporin A, cross-linked, and then treated with endoglycosidase F to remove the carbohydrate groups. Treatment of mature cross-linked mutant ΔY490/C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature) with endoglycosidase F still resulted in a relatively slow migrating cross-linked product (Fig. 2D, right panel). Treatment of the cross-linked, deglycosylated mutant P-gp with dithiothreitol caused the cross-linked product to disappear and increased the amount of the 140-kDa protein (data not shown). Therefore, the inability to detect a slower migrating form of P-gp after treatment of the immature 150-kDa protein with oxidant was not caused by differences in the amount of glycosylation. These results show that the interface between the two NBDs in the misfolded mutant ΔY490/C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature) is structurally different from the mature 170-kDa P-gp. The crystal structure of NBD1 of CFTR (35Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Hendrickson W.A. Hunt J.F. Kearins M.C. Lorimer D. Maloney P.C. Post K.W. Rajashankar K.R. Rutter M.E. Sauder J.M. Shriver S. Thibodeau P.H. Thomas P.J. Zhang M. Zhao X. Emtage S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) predicts that Tyr-490 in P-gp or Phe-508 in CFTR can be aligned in the third α-helix. Accordingly, we constructed a P-gp/CFTR chimera where the segment forming the third α-helical structure in P-gp (483TIAENIRYG491) in NBD1 of P-gp was replaced with the corresponding α-helical region (501TIKENIIFG509) from CFTR. Residue Phe-508 in the P-gp/CFTR chimera was then deleted and the resulting mutation introduced into the C431(-NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature) mutant to give mutant P-gp/CFTR(ΔF508)/C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature). Mutant P-gp/CFTR(ΔF508)/C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature) was expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A. Membranes were then prepared, treated with or without oxidant (copper phenanthroline), and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 2E shows that cross-linked product was detected only when the P-gp/CFTR chimeric protein was expressed in the presence of cyclosporin A. Effect of Other Processing Mutations on Cross-linking of NBD Cysteine Mutants—It is possible that disruption of NBD1-NBD2 interactions by ΔY490 may be a local effect because it is in the same domain (NBD1) as one of the reporter cysteines (Cys-431). Therefore, we tested whether other processing mutations that are located in other domains affected NBD1-NBD2 interactions. We have shown that mutations G268V in the second cytoplasmic loop (ICL2) connecting TMs 4 and 5 (36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), P709G in the linker region connecting the two halves of the molecule (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), G722A in TM7 (38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15414-15419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and A841L in TM9 (this study) caused misprocessing of wild-type P-gp. These mutations were then introduced into a mutant with different contact points at the NBD1-NBD2 interface (mutant L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A) (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A. Equivalent amounts of whole cell SDS extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Fig. 3 (upper panel) shows that introduction of the processing mutations, G268V (ICL2), P709G(linker), G722A(TM7), or A841L(TM9) into P-gp mutant L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A) resulted in the expression of only immature core-glycosylated (150-kDa) protein when expressed in plain media (Fig. 3, upper panel). Expression of the mutant proteins in the presence of drug substrate cyclosporin A, however, resulted in the appearance of the mature 170-kDa P-gp (Fig. 3, lower panel). We then tested whether mutants G268V(ICL2)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), P709G(linker)/L531C-(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), G722A(TM7)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), and A841L-(TM9)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), which were rescued with cyclosporin A, were active by measuring drug-stimulated ATPase activity. The histidine-tagged mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells and isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography (24Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of the isolated proteins were mixed with lipid, sonicated, and ATPase activity measured in the presence of a saturating concentration of verapamil (1 mm) or colchicine (10 mm). Verapamil was selected because it is one of the most potent activators of P-gp ATPase activity (39Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas colchicine is a classic substrate of P-gp (40Horio M. Chin K.V. Currier S.J. Goldenberg S. Williams C. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Handler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14880-14884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that all of the mutants retained greater than 90% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of mutant L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A). All of the mutants except A841L/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A) retained greater than 90% of the colchicine-stimulated ATPase activity of mutant L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A). Mutant A841L/L531C-(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A) retained only about 30% of the colchicine-stimulated ATPase activity. We have shown that residue Ala-841 in TM9 contributes to the drug binding pocket of P-gp (31Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that mutation to residue Ala-841 is affecting binding of colchicine. Because cross-linking studies on active mutants are more informative, we tested whether there was a difference in the cross-linking pattern of mutants G268V(ICL2)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), P709G(linker)/L531C-(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), G722A(TM7)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), and A841L-(TM9)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A). Membranes were prepared from cells expressing the mutants that had been grown in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A. The membranes were subjected to oxidative cross-linking with copper phenanthroline followed by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 5A, lower panel, shows that cross-linked product was detected in all of the mutants that were grown with cyclosporin A. Treatment of the cross-linked sample with the reducing agent dithiothreitol resulted in the disappearance of the cross-linked product (data not shown). No cross-linked product was detected in these mutants when grown in the presence of plain media (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Another method to determine to whether there are proper interactions between the NBDs is to test for the effect of vanadate trapping of nucleotide at the interface between the NBDs. Vanadate traps ADP at one of the two NBDs by occupying the position of the γ-phosphate adjacent to ADP. Vanadate trapping at one site inhibits ATP hydrolysis at the second site (41Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the effect of vanadate trapping of nucleotide on cross-linking of mutants G268V(ICL2)/-L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), P709G-(linker)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), G722A(TM7)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), and A841L(TM9)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A). Membranes were prepared from transfected HEK 293 cells that were grown with or without cyclosporin A, incubated with ATP plus vanadate, and then subjected to oxidative cross-linking with copper phenanthroline. Fig. 5A, lower panel, shows that vanadate trapping of nucleotide inhibited cross-linking of the mature (cyclosporin A-treated) mutants. Vanadate trapping of nucleotide had no effect on the immature form of P-gp (expressed without cyclosporin A) because no cross-linked product was detected (Fig. 5A, upper panel). To determine whether the mutants retained the ability to interact with ATP, the membranes were preincubated with ATP and MgCl2 and then subjected to oxidative cross-linking. Fig. 5B shows that amount of cross-linked product in each mutant was reduced in the presence of ATP, indicating that the mutants could still interact with ATP. Cross-linking between thiol groups by copper phenanthroline is very efficient if the β-carbons are a maximal distance of 7 Å apart, with the average being 5–6 Å (42Katz B.A. Kossiakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15480-15485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was possible that the cysteines in the misprocessed mutants were not cross-linked with copper phenanthroline because the cysteines were too far apart or were buried within the altered NBDs such that they were not exposed to the aqueous environment. To test whether they were far apart but accessible, we tested for cross-linking with homobifunctional thiol-reactive cross-linkers. Alkylthiosulfonate cross-linkers are useful because they are generally more reactive with cysteine than other thiol-reactive compounds such as maleimides (43Bruice T.W. Kenyon G.L. J. Protein Chem. 1982; 1: 47-58Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutant ΔY490/C431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-signature) was expressed in HEK 293 cells in the absence of the chemical chaperone cyclosporin A. Membranes were prepared, and samples were treated with relatively short (1,3-propanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M3M, 6.5 Å)) and long cross-linkers (3,6-dioxaoctane-1,8-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M8M, 13 Å)) (16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. There was no shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the 150-kDa core-glycosylated protein when the mutant was treated with M3M (data not shown). Treatment of the mutant with 25–100 μm M8M, however, resulted in the appearance of a protein that migrated with lower electrophoretic mobility than the 150-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A). To test whether cross-linking by M8M was inhibited by vanadate trapping of nucleotide, the membranes were preincubated with ATP plus vanadate for 10 min at 37 °C, cross-linked with 25 μm M8M, followed by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 6B shows that the amount of cross-linked product was not decreased after treatment with ATP plus vanadate. Similar results were observed when mutants G268V(ICL2)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074-(NBD2-Walker A), P709G(linker)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), G722A(TM7)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A), and A841L(TM9)/L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A) were grown without cyclosporin A and treated with either M3M or M8M (data not shown). These results suggest that the cysteines are still exposed in the misprocessed mutants but that the NBDs show inefficient vanadate trapping of nucleotide. The inability to cross-link cysteines in the Walker A of one NBD with another cysteine in the LSGGQ signature sequence of the second NBD in the ΔY490 mutant (Fig. 2) suggests that the orientation at the NBD interface is altered. The misalignment between the NBDs appeared to persist even when mutations outside of the NBDs (G268V(ICL2), P709G(linker), G722A(TM7), and A841L(TM9)) were introduced into P-gp (Fig. 5). The incorrect orientation of the NBDs may be one reason why the immature 150-kDa form of P-gp does not exhibit any detectable drug-stimulated ATPase activity (44Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1724-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the orientations of the Walker A in one NBD relative to the LSGGQ signature sequence in the second NBD are critical for coupling of drug binding to ATP hydrolysis. Substrates such as calcein-AM, demecolcine, cis-(Z)-flupenthixol, and verapamil which stimulate ATPase activity of P-gp increase the rate of cross-linking between cysteines in the Walker A and LSGGQ signature sequences (39Loo T.W.

By contrast, substrates such as trans-(E)-flupenthixol and Hoechst 33342, which inhibit ATPase activity, prevent cross-linking between the these sites (39Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Attempts to restore cross-linking of the immature 150-kDa mutant P-gp by including stimulatory substrates (verapamil) during cross-linking did not result in the appearance of cross-linked product in SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The lack of cross-linking even in the presence of verapamil is consistent with the finding that introduction of processing mutations into P-gp also disrupts packing of the TM segments, thereby disrupting the common drug binding pocket at the TMD interface (17Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The activities of misprocessed P-gp mutants G268V(ICL2), P709G(linker), G722A(TM7), and A841L(TM9) were restored when the mutants were grown in the presence of the drug substrate cyclosporin A (Fig. 5). All mutants, except for mutant A841L(TM9) retained more than 90% of their verapamil- and colchicine-stimulated ATPase activities compared with that of mutant L531C(NBD1-signature)/C1074(NBD2-Walker A). The verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of mutant A841L(TM9) was unaffected, but it only retained about 30% of the colchicine-stimulated ATPase activity. A mutation in TM9 affecting drug-stimulated ATPase activity would be consistent with the findings that this residue contributes to the common drug binding pocket (31Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and may be important for the binding of colchicine but not verapamil. Rescuing misprocessed mutants with cyclosporin A also restored the ability of cysteines in the Walker A and LSGGQ signature sequences to be cross-linked with oxidant. The drug binding pocket between the TMDs likely forms cotranslationally and exists transiently during synthesis of the misprocessed mutants. The presence of drug substrate (specific chemical chaperone) during synthesis likely acts as a scaffold to stabilize the TMDs. This may allow the mutant protein to overcome folding barriers such as inducing long range conformational changes in the NBDs for the formation of proper contacts during the folding. These barriers may not be present in the folding of wild-type enzyme. In the absence of drug substrate, the drug binding pocket may collapse as a result of improper contacts among the TMD and NBD domains. This may explain why drug substrates cannot rescue the misfolded mutants once they have been synthesized (data not shown). Interactions among the four domains of wild-type P-gp are shown as a model in Fig. 7A, in which they interact correctly to allow the protein to mature and form an active enzyme. It appears that the individual domains of ABC transporters can fold properly because the structure of NBD1 of CFTR resembles the structure of a complete ABC transporter such as MsbA (45Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and BtuCD (46Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The individual domains of ABC transporters may undergo cotranslational protein folding that is postulated to occur during folding of eukaryotic protein (47Komar A.A. Kommer A. Krasheninnikov I.A. Spirin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10646-10651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 48Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32715-32718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The next step would involve superfolding of the individual domains to form a functional protein (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The presence of a processing mutation, however, interferes with the ability of the various domains to form correct contacts (Fig. 7B) resulting in a “loosely folded” immature 150-kDa P-gp that does not undergo further processing. This conformation is about 100-fold more sensitive to proteases than the “compact” conformation observed with wild-type P-gp (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The presence of drug substrate during synthesis of the misprocessed mutant stabilizes the drug binding pocket and increases the chance for proper contacts to form between the TMDs and NBDs and between the NBDs, resulting in a properly folded molecule (Fig. 7C). It is interesting that the presence of ATP in the cytoplasm does not cause the processing mutants to fold correctly. This may be because ATP-induced dimerization of the NBDs of bacterial ABC transporters occurs only when hydrolysis is impaired by mutations in the NBDs (32Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 49Moody J.E. Millen L. Binns D. Hunt J.F. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21111-21114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Therefore, misprocessed mutants that have normal NBDs may not be rescued with ATP because dimerization would effectively hydrolyze the ATP that would be present at the NBD-NBD interface. In summary, the presence of processing mutations interferes with interactions between the TMDs, between TMDs and NBDs (17Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and between the NBDs. The TMDs are the most feasible target for inducing proper folding of ABC transporters because drug substrates rather than the presence of ATP are important for promoting proper folding and maturation of P-gp mutants. This is consistent with the finding that interaction of drug substrates with the TMDs alone was sufficient to promote proper folding and trafficking of the protein (50Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results show that the TMDs are the most feasible targets for the search of compounds that can induce proper folding of misprocessed ABC transporters such as ΔF508-CFTR."

The integration of L1 may play a role in genetic diseases and cancers (2Miki Y. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and in gene evolution and genome reconstruction (3Moran J.V. DeBerardinis R.J. Kazazian Jr., H.H.

Cell. 2002; 110: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).The LINEs have been classified into two types according to the number of open reading frames (ORFs) (6Malik H.S. Burke W.D. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The first type of element has a single ORF and encodes an endonuclease domain near its C terminus; this type of endonuclease (also known as restriction enzyme-like endonuclease) is similar in some residual motifs to various prokaryotic restriction enzymes (7Yang J. Malik H.S. Eickbush T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7847-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The second type of element has two ORFs; ORF1 encodes a retroviral Gag-like protein whose function is still unclear, and ORF2 encodes a protein with an endonuclease domain at its N terminus and a reverse transcriptase domain in the center of the ORF. This class of endonuclease domain is made up of about 250 amino acid residues and shares sequence homology with apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases (APE), such as human APE1 and Escherichia coli exonuclease III.Most of the APE-like endonuclease-encoding retrotransposons do not insert in a sequence-specific manner into the host genome, like the human L1 elements that cleave AT-rich sequences with a low sequence specificity (8Feng Q. Moran J.V. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Boeke J.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 905-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). However, several endonuclease-encoding LINE have very restricted integration targets within the genome (9Kojima K.K. Fujiwara H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TRAS1 and R1Bm, found in Bombyx mori, are the typical sequence-specific elements, which insert between T and A of the (TTAGG)n telomeric repeat and a specific site in 28 S rDNA of B. mori, respectively (10Okazaki S. Ishikawa H. Fujiwara H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4545-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Jakubczak J.L. Burke W.D. Eickbush T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3295-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the endonuclease domain in the ORF2 of TRAS1 (12Takahashi H. Fujiwara H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and R1Bm (13Feng Q. Schumann G. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2083-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) determines its own target sequence recognition and DNA cleavage activity.The amino acid identity between human APE1 and the endonuclease domain of TRAS1 (TRAS1-EN) is not very high (11%), but in general the catalytic residues are well conserved between APE1 and LINE-ENs. Most of the APE-like endonucleases in LINEs, however, cannot cleave apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites (8Feng Q. Moran J.V. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Boeke J.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 905-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 14Cost G.J. Boeke J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 18081-18093Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, it is hypothesized that LINE-ENs primarily cleave the bottom strand (e.g. TTAGG for TRAS1) followed by the top strand (CCTAA), supporting the target-primed reverse transcription model, which is a system unique to LINEs (13Feng Q. Schumann G. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2083-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Luan D.D. Korman M.H. Jakubczak J.L. Eickbush T.H.

At present, however, little is known about the mechanisms of sequence recognition and digestion by endonuclease domains during the process of target-primed reverse transcription. These features of the APE-like endonucleases of LINEs, which are quite different from those of the cellular AP endonucleases, are yet to be elucidated.Here, we determined the crystal structure of TRAS1-EN at 2.4-Å resolution. The structure of TRAS1-EN forms a four-layered α/β-sandwich and its topology is similar to the cellular APEs studied so far. The β-hairpin formed by β10-β11 of TRAS1-EN is projected to the edge of the DNA-binding surface, which distinguishes it from the other known AP endonuclease structures. The mutational studies also suggested that this β-hairpin and Asp-130 are involved in telomere sequence specificity of TRAS1-EN.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification and Crystallization—The TRAS1-EN expression vector (pHisT1EN) was constructed and transfected into E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS strain as described previously (16Anzai T. Takahashi H. Fujiwara H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The His10-tagged TRAS1-ENs were purified by Ni2+-bound HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences), followed by a Factor Xa digestion. The sample solution was further purified with cation and anion exchange column chromatography, resulting in highly purified TRAS1-EN. The protein was concentrated in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) to give a 12 mg/ml protein solution. Selenomethionine-substituted TRAS1-EN was expressed in strain B834pLysS(DE3) (Novagen) grown in LeMaster medium (18Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) containing 25 mg/liter l-selenomethionine; subsequent purification steps were the same as those for native TRAS1-EN.Crystallization was carried out using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of TRAS1-EN were typically grown in 10 days from a drop consisting of 2.5 μl of protein solution and 2.0 μl of reservoir solution at 283 K. The reservoir solution contains 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 2 m ammonium sulfate, 3% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, 1 mm MgSO4, and 15-20% (v/v) glycerol.Data Collection, Multiwavelength Anomalous Dispersion (MAD) Phasing, and Model Refinement—A single crystal was picked from the droplet with a nylon loop and flash-frozen in a cryostream at 100 K. The native and MAD data sets were collected at beamline BL-6B in Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) and BL41XU in SPring-8 (Harima, Japan), respectively.All data were indexed and integrated with MOSFLM (19Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), followed by scaling with SCALA (20Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to P32 space groups with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 64.6 Å, c = 117.3 Å. The selenium site searching and the MAD phasing calculation were done by SOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) using 20-2.5-Å resolution. 8 of 12 selenium sites were used for the phase calculation. The phases were determined to a mean figure of merit of 0.60. The density modification calculation and initial model building were employed automatically by RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar), resulting in the mean figure of merit of 0.68. The native data showed a hemihedral twinning with twinning operator (k, h,-l) and twinning fraction of 0.184 (see Supplemental Data); therefore, the intensities of the native data were processed with DETWIN (20Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar) before refinement calculation. The twinning tests on MAD data sets did not show twinning possibility.

The point mutations were generated by a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the primers used for the introduction of these mutations are available on request. The Δloop mutant, which deleted Ile199-Arg200 and Lys203-Arg204 (see “Results”), was constructed as follows. First, a DNA fragment from 3788 to 4397 bp of pHisT1EN was removed by NdeI-KpnI digestion (pHisT1EN Δ3788-4397), and then a PCR fragment was amplified by the primers S3788 (5′-AAAAACATATGCACGGCGAGCAGTGGAA-3′) and A4393 (5′-AAAAAGGTACCCTCCTCTGATCGTATCAAATGTCGGGAC-3′). This fragment was digested by NdeI and KpnI (their recognition sites are underlined in S3788 and A4393, respectively) and subcloned into pHisT1EN Δ3788-4397, resulting in a 6-bp deletion from 4394 to 4399. Secondly, Lys-203 and Arg-204 were deleted by the inverse PCR using 5′-phosphorylated primers S4388 (5′-GGAGGGTACCAAAGCCGCGTGGATGTG-3′) and A4381 (5′-CGTATCAAATGTCGGGACATCTCCCTCGT-3′). The amplified product was then self-ligated, resulting in a 6-bp deletion from 4382 to 4387. The correct introduction of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Plasmid Nicking Study—TRAS1-EN for use in the nicking assay was expressed in the same way as the protein used for crystallization, except that the fractions from the HiTrap chelating column were directly dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) using the 10-kDa Ultra-free-MC centrifugal filter unit (Millipore Corp.) to obtain the one-step purified TRAS1-EN protein with an N-terminal 22-amino acid tag.The silkworm telomeric repeat, (TTAGG)n, was amplified from the pGL3-Enhancer vector containing 51 telomeric repeats (25Takahashi H. Fujiwara H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2015-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pGEM T easy (Promega). The endonuclease activity of TRAS1-EN was assayed by incubating 1.0 μg of supercoiled pGEM T easy-(TTAGG)25 with 50 ng of TRAS1-EN protein for 40 min at 25 °C. The reaction buffer contained 15 mm PIPES-Cl (pH 6.0), 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml). The reactions were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide; the supercoiled, open circular, and linear DNA were quantified by densitometry. The nicking activities were evaluated as the proportion of supercoiled DNA that was converted into circular and linear form. Each value was obtained from five independent experiments.Oligonucleotide Cleavage—32P-labeled telomeric DNA was prepared as described previously (16Anzai T. Takahashi H. Fujiwara H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 40-bp oligonucleotide containing 28 S rDNA sequence of the silkworm (5′-ACGAGATTCCCACTGTCCCTATCTACTATCTAGCGAAACC-3′) was also radiolabeled, annealed with the nonlabeled complementary strand, and gel-purified. 1 ng of the substrate DNAs was treated with 0.2 μg of purified proteins in 50 mm PIPES-Cl (pH 6.0), 7.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml) in the 50-μl volume at 25 °C. The incubation was stopped by the addition of EDTA at a final concentration of 50 mm after 40 min. The resulting fragments were denatured at 95 °C, ethanol-precipitated, and separated on a 30% polyacrylamide denaturing gel, together with the end-labeled oligonucleotides: 5′-TTAGGTTAGGTT-3′ and 5′-TTAGGTTAGGTTAGGTT-3′ for Fig. 5D. Quantification of the bands was carried out with BAS 5000 imaging analyzer system (Fuji-film). To determine the percentage of cleaved substrate, the radioactivity of the substrate before the reaction was divided by the intensity of the sum of the cleaved substrate after subtracting a lane background and that from products out of resolution. Significant differences were determined using Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered to be significant.Figure Preparation—All figures were drawn with the programs MOLSCRIPT (26Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), RASTER3D (27Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3869) Google Scholar), and PyMOL (W. L. DeLano; available on the World Wide Web at www.pymol.org).RESULTSTRAS1-EN Efficiently Digests Both (TTAGG)nand (TTAGGG)n—Previous studies have shown that TRAS1-EN first generates a nick between T and A of the (TTAGG)n bottom strand of insect telomeric repeats and then between C and T of the (CCTAA)n top strand (Fig. 1A) (16Anzai T. Takahashi H. Fujiwara H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To confirm the sequence specificity of TRAS1-EN, its endonucleolytic activity was tested for various telomeric repeats from several organisms using double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates. TRAS1-EN digested the (TTAGGG)5 of the human-type telomeric repeats between T and A, producing ladder bands at intervals of exactly 6 bp (Fig. 1B). Compared with the (TTAGGG)5 bottom strand, TRAS1-EN showed lower specificity for the (CCCTAA)5 top strand. It also digested the 5′-(TTAGGC)5/5′-(GCCTAA)5 repeats of Caenorhabditis elegans at two specific sites, although its specificity seemed lower. No obvious pattern of site-specific digestion was observed for the 5′-(TTTAGGG)3/5′-(CCCTAAA)3 repeats of Arabidopsis thaliana, the 5′-(TTTTAGGG)3/5′-(CCCTAAAA)3 repeats of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, or the 5′-(TGTGTGGG)3/5′-(CCCACACA)3 repeats of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These data demonstrate that TRAS1-EN is specific to the consecutive (GGTTAGG) sequence that is conserved in insect (TTAGG)n and human (TTAGGG)n but not in the other four telomeric sequences tested. In support of the above observations are previous findings that TRAS1-EN recognizes less than 10 bp surrounding the bottom strand cleavage site (7 bp upstream and 3 bp downstream) and that the GTTAG sequence (TTAGGTT↓AGG, where ↓ represents the cleavage site) is essential for the cleavage reaction (16Anzai T. Takahashi H. Fujiwara H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Fig. 1The telomeric repeat-specific LINE, TRAS1, and its endonuclease activity.A, schematic structure and integration process of TRAS1. ORF2 of TRAS1 encodes EN and reverse-transcriptase (RT) domains. The vertical lines near the C terminus of both ORFs represent the cysteine-histidine motifs. In the initial step of TRAS1 retrotransposition, EN makes a specific nick between T and A of the bottom strand (TTAGG)n and then between C and T of the top strand (CCTAA)n (I). By target-primed reverse transcription, TRAS1 inserts into the Bombyx telomeric repeats with its poly(A) tail facing toward the centromere (II). The shaded triangles indicates the telomeric repeats. B, nicking activity of TRAS1-EN for telomeric repeat sequences from various organisms. Single-stranded telomeric DNA corresponding to the bottom and top strands was end-labeled and annealed to the complementary nonlabeled strand. The resulting double-stranded DNA substrate was digested with 0.2 μg of purified TRAS-EN protein (16Anzai T. Takahashi H. Fujiwara H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the products were separated on 28% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The end-labeled DNA substrates and reaction times (in minutes) at 25 °C are indicated above the photographs. The intervals between the specific cleaved products are shown on the left for (TTAGG)n and (TTAGGG)n substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequence Comparison of TRAS1-EN and Other LINE-ENs—To initially predict the regions within the endonuclease domains that might be responsible for catalytic activity and sequence-specific recognition, the endonuclease domain sequences of TRAS1 and various LINEs were aligned and compared with the human APE1 sequence (Fig. 2). TRAS3, which is a subfamily of TRAS found in B. mori, has the same integration site in the (TTAGG)n telomeric repeats as TRAS1 (29Kubo Y. Okazaki S. Anzai T. Fujiwara H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 848-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SART1 is another telomeric repeat-specific element that integrates between T and A of the (CCTAA)n bottom strand (30Takahashi H. Okazaki S. Fujiwara H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1578-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and R1Bm is a 28 S rDNA-specific element from B. mori (13Feng Q. Schumann G. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2083-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Xiong Y. Eickbush T.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). There are several amino acids that are conserved among all elements and are dispersed throughout the whole region, which seems essential for the endonucleolytic activity of APE-endonucleases. Some of these amino acids have already been shown to be essential for the activity of L1-EN (8Feng Q. Moran J.V. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Boeke J.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 905-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Overall, however, the total amino acid sequence identity of the endonuclease domains is relatively low not only between TRAS1 and L1 (13%), but also even between the sequence-specific retroelements of B. mori (TRAS1/TRAS3, 58%; TRAS1/R1Bm, 27%; TRAS1/SART1, 25%). The sequence identity between APE1 and any LINE-EN is quite low (TRAS1/APE1, 11%). It is remarkable that the two regions, shown by thin gray lines in Fig. 2, are present in APE1 and other cellular AP endonucleases but are absent from LINE-ENs. Seven long amino acid tracts (Fig. 2, purple boxes) are highly conserved between TRAS1 and TRAS3, giving important information on the identity of the region responsible for specific recognition of the telomeric repeats.Fig. 2Amino acid sequence alignment of human APE1 and endonuclease domains from various non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons. Telomeric-repeat specific LINEs, TRAS1 and TRAS3, integrate into the same position of (TTAGG)n. SART1 represents another class of telomeric repeat-specific LINE, R1Bm is a 28 S rDNA-specific LINE, and L1 is a human non-sequence-specific LINE. The amino acids conserved among all elements are indicated by red letters. The relatively conserved amino acids (more than four matched in six sequences) are shown in boldface type. The dashes indicate gaps introduced to maximize homology. Seven regions highly conserved between TRAS1 and TRAS3 are shown in purple (29Kubo Y. Okazaki S. Anzai T. Fujiwara H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 848-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In two regions, which are shown by gray lines under the sequences, LINEs have shorter amino acid tracts compared with that of APE1. Secondary structural information (α1-3, β1-14, 310A, and 310B) obtained by crystal analyses is shown above the amino acid sequences. The amino acids altered in mutagenesis studies (Fig. 5) are shaded blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Overall Structure of TRAS1-EN—To investigate the particular features of TRAS1-EN that specifically recognize the telomeric repeats, we have expressed, purified, and crystallized TRAS1-EN (see “Experimental Procedures”). The native and MAD data were collected with synchrotron radiation; the resulting space group of the crystal was determined to be P32 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 64.6 Å, c = 117.3 Å. Finally, the crystal structure of TRAS1-EN was determined at 2.4-Å resolution with Rcryst = 22.5% (Rfree = 25.3%) (Fig. 3). Two TRAS1-EN molecules per asymmetric unit were observed; the root mean square deviation between Cα of two molecules was 0.70 Å.

In the presence of ATP, Tag monomers bind to specific origin sequences, assembling around the DNA and distorting it locally (reviewed by Refs. 2Bullock P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and 4Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Bullock P.A. Hurwitz J. Cell. 1990; 60: 181-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence indicates that the double hexamer serves as a bidirectional helicase. Powered by ATP hydrolysis, it unwinds parental DNA by pulling the parental duplex toward the center of the double hexamer and spooling out two loops of single-stranded template DNA for leading and lagging strand replication (reviewed by Refs. 5Fanning E. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 250-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and 6Stenlund A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As Tag unwinds the DNA, it orchestrates the assembly of the replisome through physical interactions with the host single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA), DNA polymerase α-primase, and topoisomerase I (reviewed by Refs. 3Simmons D.T. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 75-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Stenlund A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Wold M.S. Annu. Rev.

Electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic studies strongly suggest that the double hexameric complex forms the core of the replisome, leading to the assembly of leading and lagging strand complexes containing a minimum of 10 host proteins (2Bullock P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Simmons D.T. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 75-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Stenlund A. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Much effort has been aimed at elucidating in detail the operation of this comparatively simple viral replisome with the hope that general principles can be discerned that will increase our understanding of mammalian chromosomal replication. The bidirectional origin unwinding activity of Tag is tightly regulated by its phosphorylation state (5Fanning E. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 250-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Weisshart K. Taneja P. Jenne A. Herbig U. Simmons D.T. Fanning E. J.

The phosphorylated residues cluster in two regions located in the N (residues 106-124) and C termini (residues 637 to 701). The replication-active form of Tag must be phosphorylated on Thr-124, whereas Ser-120 and Ser-123 must be unmodified. Dephosphorylation of Thr-124 or phosphorylation of either Ser-120 or Ser-123 reduces cooperative interactions between the two hexamers, thereby blocking the bidirectional unwinding process (10Weisshart K. Taneja P. Jenne A. Herbig U. Simmons D.T. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Virshup D.M. Russo A. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell.

However, it remains unclear how this phosphorylation state-dependent interaction between the two hexamers facilitates the unwinding process. The size and shape of soluble Tag hexamers and origin DNA-bound double hexamers have been studied intensively by high-resolution microscopic techniques (13Mastrangelo I.A. Hough P.V. Wall J.S.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The hexamer is propeller-shaped and contains a central channel (16San Martin M.C. Gruss C. Carazo J.M. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the double hexamer, the DNA traverses the inner channel of both hexamers, which are arranged in a head-to-head complex with the propeller structures on opposite ends. By decorating the double hexameric complex with monoclonal antibodies that have known epitopes, the origin DNA/RPA-binding domains of the two hexamers were shown to localize in the head-to-head structure, and the C-terminal helicase domains were localized to the propellers (17Valle M. Gruss C. Halmer L. Carazo J.M. Donate L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), confirming previous genetic and biochemical studies (10Weisshart K. Taneja P. Jenne A. Herbig U. Simmons D.T. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2201-2211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two hexamers in the origin DNA-bound double hexamer were not identical in structure, and a fitting of the helicase domain structure into the electron microscopic density map indicated that the two hexamers were rotated relative to each other (19Gomez-Lorenzo M.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, no crystal structure of full-length Tag is currently available, so the spatial arrangement of these domains in the intact structure is not known. Early studies of Tag by limited proteolytic digestion revealed several protease-resistant structural domains that correspond loosely to the known atomic structures of Tag, namely an N-terminal fragment of 130 residues, an internal fragment comprising amino acids 131-371, and a C-terminal fragment of unspecified boundaries (reviewed by 1Fanning E. Knippers R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 2Bullock P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

However, these early studies did not distinguish between the monomeric, hexameric, and double hexameric forms of Tag, precluding the identification of potential contacts among domains or conformation changes upon oligomerization. In this study, we have extended the partial proteolysis approach to defined oligomeric forms of Tag to ask whether the Tag domains interact with each other in monomeric Tag and to look for possible structural changes in the molecule upon hexamer formation. We show that monomeric Tag consists of three protease-resistant structural domains comprising amino acids 1-130, 131-476, and 513-698. Co-immunoprecipitation of proteolytic fragments provides evidence for intramolecular contacts between the N-terminal and central domains. Hexamer formation occludes cleavage sites and an antibody epitope in the C terminus that were accessible in the monomer. These data suggest a low-resolution model for the structural organization of full-length Tag. Limited Proteolysis of Tag Monomers and Analysis of Digestion Products—Tag expressed in Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus was purified as described (23Dornreiter I. Hoss A. Arthur A.K. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3329-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science) (dissolved and diluted in 1 mm HCl) and 5 μg of Tag (0.94 μg/pmol) in the indicated protease/Tag mass ratios were incubated in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8, 10% glycerol, and 3 mm dithiothreitol. After 30 min at room temperature, trypsin was inhibited by the addition of 1 μl of a 0.4 mg/ml solution of α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) to yield a final concentration of ∼40 μg/ml. Incubation was continued for 2 min on ice before the addition of 4 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoresed on 12.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were either stained with Coomassie or immunoblotted (25Towbin H.T. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Epitope mapping and characterization of the Tag-specific monoclonal antibodies Pab108, Pab101, Pab419, Pab416, Pab414, Pab220, Pab221, Pab204, and KT3 have been described (Ref. 26Weisshart K.

To ensure that the same conditions were used to assay Tag oligomerization and generate tryptic peptides of hexameric Tag (see below), 1 μl of 1 mm HCl was added, and the protein was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. One microliter of α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.4 mg/ml) (Roche Applied Science) was added, and the protein was incubated for 5 min on ice. One microliter of a 2% glutaraldehyde solution was added, and the reaction was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Unreacted glutaraldehyde was quenched by the addition of 1 μl of 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8, and 100 mm glycine. After 5 min at 37 °C, 1 μl of benzonase (10 units/μl) (Merck) was added, and the DNA, if present, was degraded for 10 min at 37 °C. The samples were then supplemented with 5 μl of 4× Laemmli buffer without SDS and reducing agent and immediately electrophoresed in a 5-15% native gradient gel (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris and 19 mm glycine buffer. Gels were then stained with Coomassie. Limited Proteolysis of Tag Hexamers—The reaction was performed as described above, except that 1 mm HCl was substituted by trypsin at a protease/Tag mass ratio of 1:250. The digestion products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis as described above for monomer digests. Automated N-terminal Sequencing of Tryptic Fragments—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and stained with Coomassie. The protein bands of interest were excised, and the first 8-10 N-terminal amino acids were determined using a Procise 494 HT Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Immunoprecipitation of Monomeric and Hexameric Tags—Ten micrograms of purified monoclonal antibody were bound to 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-agarose beads in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.25% inositol, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH7.9, 100 mm KCl, and 7 mm MgCl2). One picomole of Tag (0.94 μg/pmol) preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in 100 μl of binding buffer (monomeric Tag) or binding buffer supplemented with 7 mm MgCl2 and 4 mm AMP-PNP (hexameric Tag) was added to the beads. After 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer and then boiled in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted proteins were electrophoresed on a 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and detected by Western blotting (25Towbin H.T. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44933) Google Scholar) using a mixture of Pab419 and 101 with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of precipitated Tag was evaluated by densitometry of the exposed films. Immunoprecipitation after Trypsin Treatment—Ten microliters of the digestion products, 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G agarose (Roche Applied Science), and 10 μg of either monoclonal antibody Pab419, specific for the N terminus, or Pab204, directed against the central region, were added to 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 0.05% SDS/0.1% sodium deoxycholate. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking, the beads were washed four times with supplemented immunoprecipitation buffer and once with immunoprecipitation buffer. The beads were then boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. After gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose filters, protein fragments were detected by Western blotting with Pab419 or Pab204 and the ECL system. Alternatively, digestion products were first denatured by adding 10% SDS and 100 mm dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 1% and 10 mm, respectively, heated at 90 °C for 2 min, cooled on ice, and then immunoprecipitated with Pab419 or Pab204 as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift—Two femtomoles of the SV40 origin-containing 5′-end-labeled EcoRI-HindIII DNA fragment of pUCmori (26Weisshart K. Taneja P. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9771-9781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (specific activity 10,000 cpm/fmol) were incubated in a 10-μl reaction in binding buffer (30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 0.2 μg/μl creatine kinase, 4 mm AMP-PNP, 10 ng/μl pBluescript KSII, and 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin) with 30 fmol of Tag for 30 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, Tag was either pre-incubated with 1 μg of purified antibody for 10 min at room temperature before its addition to the DNA binding reaction (pre-incubation), or 1 μg of antibody was added to the DNA binding assay 10 min after the Tag was added (post-incubation). Protein was cross-linked to DNA by adding glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 0.2% and incubating for 5 min, followed by the addition of 0.2 volumes of loading buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 2% Ficoll 400, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 0.2% xylene cyanol). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 3.5% native polyacrylamide gel in TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 200 V. The gel was dried and autoradiographed, and DNA binding was quantified by densitometry of the autoradiogram. Limited Proteolysis of Tag and Mapping of Tryptic Fragments—Monomeric Tag was treated with increasing amounts of trypsin, and the digestion products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Full-length Tag with a calculated molecular mass of 82.5 kDa migrates as a band with an apparent molecular mass of 94 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 1, fragment T). Tag was readily degraded to fragments of 88, 77, 70, and 55 kDa in apparent molecular mass (Fig. 1, lane 3, fragments 1-4 and 6). Increasing the protease concentration yielded additional fragments of 56, 53, 45, 40 28, 25, 17, 15, and 13 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 4, fragments 5, 8-14). When the protease concentration was raised further, the yield of fragments 1-6 decreased significantly, whereas that of fragments 8-14 remained constant (Fig. 1, lane 5). Even at the highest protease concentration tested, fragments 8-14 were resistant to proteolysis (Fig. 1, lane 6). The approximate location of each fragment in the primary Tag sequence was mapped by immunoblotting the digestion products using monoclonal antibodies with known epitopes (Fig. 2). To this end, Tag was digested at a protease/protein ratio of 1:500, yielding all of the tryptic fragments 1-14 detected in Fig. 1 (Fig. 2, lane 2, t). Each antibody reacted with the full-length, undigested Tag as expected (Fig. 2, odd-numbered lanes, u). Fragments 1, 5, 6, 12, 13, and 14 contained the N-terminal part of Tag, because they reacted with the N-terminal specific antibodies Pab108, Pab419, and Pab416 (Fig. 2, lanes 4, 6, and 8). Fragments 3-6, 8, and 9 were detected by Pab204, demonstrating that they contained the central part of Tag (Fig. 2, lane 14). Fragments 5 and 6 were reactive to both N-terminal and central region antibodies. However, because their length was too short to allow recognition by both antibodies, the data imply that the positions marked 5 and 6 (Fig. 2, far left) must contain a mixture of fragments that will be referred to as 5a and 5b and 6a and 6b (Table I). Fragment 2 reacted with all antibodies except those against the extreme C terminus, indicating that this fragment lacks the C terminus of Tag (Fig. 2, lanes 18 and 20) and possibly some N-terminal residues. Fragment 7 was detected by antibodies Pab416, Pab220, and Pab221, but not Pab204 (Fig. 2, lanes 8, 10, 12, and 14), suggesting that it was derived from the central part of Tag on the N-terminal side of the Pab204 epitope. Judging by their sizes and reactivity with Pab204, fragments 3, 4, 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b, 8, and 9 should contain the epitopes of Pab 220 and Pab221. However, these antibodies, like Pab414, are conformation-specific and do not react with denatured fragments (26Weisshart K. Taneja P. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9771-9781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, fragments 2 and 7 retained these conformational epitopes to some extent. Fragments 10 and 11 did not react with any of the antibodies used.Table IMapping data of tryptic fragments of TagFragment designationSizeAntibody reactivityN terminal sequenceN terminus boundaryC terminus boundaryN terminusaOne or more alternatives for the calculated cleavage sites. potential cleavageC-terminusaOne or more alternatives for the calculated cleavage sites. potential cleavagekDaT94108, 419, 416, 220, 221, 204, 414, 101, KT3N.

Open table in a new tab To map the N-terminal ends of the tryptic fragments more precisely and identify the derivation of fragments 10 and 11, Coomassie-stained bands were subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The N termini of fragments 3, 4, 5b, 6b, 8, and 9 were all derived from a single prominent cleavage site after arginine 130 (Table I). Fragments 10 and 11 were derived by cleavage after arginine 483 and lysine 512, respectively. T antigen and fragments 1, 5a, 6a, and 12 yielded no N-terminal sequence information, probably due to an N-terminal modification (1Fanning E. Knippers R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 2Bullock P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Simmons D.T. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 75-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments 7, 13, and 14 yielded sequence data that could not be interpreted. Based on peptide size, antibody reactivity, and N-terminal sequence, we were able to fit each fragment into a tryptic map (Fig. 3). For each fragment for which N-terminal sequence information was available (fragments 3, 4, 5b, 6b, 8, 9, 10, and 11), the most likely C-terminal cleavage site was calculated according to the apparent size of the fragment (Table I). Because fragment 1 did not react with KT3 or Pab101 and fragments 5a and 6a did not react with Pab204, but all of them reacted with N-terminal antibodies, it was reasonable to propose that they all contained the N terminus of Tag, allowing us to calculate their most likely C-terminal cleavage sites based on the fragment sizes. The small fragments 12, 13, and 14 were clearly N-terminal based on their antibody reactivity with Pab108, Pab419, and Pab416, but based on their apparent sizes, the absence of potential cleavage sites for trypsin between amino acids 68 to 126, and the strong cleavage site after Arg-130, we reasoned that fragments 12, 13, and 14 ended with amino acid 130. This led us to map fragment 12 to residues 1-130 and fragments 13 and 14 to the same region, but with N-terminal truncations. Fragment 2 reacted exclusively with antibodies whose epitopes map in the central part of the protein. Based on the size of peptide 2 and absence of reactivity with Pab101 and KT3, the extreme C terminus was assumed to be missing as for fragment 1, and, accordingly, its N terminus could be determined by calculation. Fragment 7 did not react with Pab419 or Pab204, placing it between these two epitopes. We wish to stress that because of uncertainties in peptide size calculations and the imprecise mapping of many of the antibody epitopes, the calculated termini of the fragments shown in Fig. 3 must be considered as approximations. Table I lists alternative potential alternative cleavage sites that are consistent with apparent size, immunoreactivity, and available N-terminal sequence. Co-immunoprecipitation of Complexes between Protease-resistant Fragments of Tag Monomers—To search for intramolecular interactions among Tag domains, we reasoned that if such contact surfaces between domains were sufficiently stable after tryptic digestion of native monomeric Tag, we might be able to detect them by co-immunoprecipitation. Because it was of particular interest to identify contacts of the N-terminal domain with the central or C-terminal region in order to extend our understanding of full-length Tag structure, we chose monoclonal antibodies with epitopes in the N-terminal (Pab419) and central regions (Pab204) to precipitate Tag digests (see the epitope map in Fig. 2). An antibody, 70C, which does not react with Tag (27Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a negative control. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using tryptic digests of Tag, either before denaturation to detect co-precipitated fragments or after denaturation as a control for the specificity of the pull-down (Fig. 4). When the input tryptic digests were immunoblotted with Pab204, fragments 2, 3, 4, 5b, 6b, 8, and 9 were visible (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 5), consistent with the peptide mapping in Figs. 2 and 3. When the native digest was precipitated with Pab419 and blotted with Pab204, fragments 2, 4, 8, and 9 were still detected in the precipitate (Fig. 4, lane 3). In contrast, when the digest was denatured before immunoprecipitation with Pab419, fragments 4, 8, and 9 were no longer detectable by Pab204 (Fig. 4, lane 4). We conclude from this result that fragments 4, 8, and 9 were associated with an N-terminal domain of Tag in the native digest. Conversely, when either the native or the denatured digest was precipitated with Pab204 and stained with the same antibody, the same set of fragments 2, 3, 4, 5b, 6b, 8, and 9 were visible both with and without denaturation before immunoprecipitation (lanes 7 and 8). When the input tryptic digest was immunoblotted with Pab419, fragments 1, 5a, 6a, 12, 13, and 14 were detected (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and 13). When the digest was immunoprecipitated with Pab419, either before or after denaturation, and immunoblotted with Pab419, only fragments 1 and 12-14, which contain the 419 epitope, were precipitated (Fig. 4, lanes 11 and 12). For unknown reasons, fragments 5a and 6a, which are recognized by Pab419 in the input digest (Fig. 4, lane 9), were either masked by the antibody"
https://openalex.org/W1534230245,"Heart failure is characterized at the cellular level by impaired contractility and abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis. We have previously shown that restoration of a key enzyme that controls intracellular Ca(2+) handling, the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a), induces functional improvement in heart failure. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to explore the effects of gene transfer of SERCA2a on genetic reprogramming in a model of heart failure. A total of 1,300 transcripts were identified to be unmodified by the effect of virus alone. Of those, 251 transcripts were found to be up- or down-regulated upon failure. A total of 51 transcripts which were either up--(27) or down--(24) regulated in heart failure were normalized to the nonfailing levels by the restoration of SERCA2a by gene transfer. The microarray analysis identified new genes following SERCA2a restoration in heart failure, which will give us insights into their role in the normalization of multiple pathways within the failing cell."

Biol. 1998; 121: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The AChR is an allosteric, integral membrane protein comprised of five subunits arranged pseudo-symmetrically with a α2δγβ stoichiometry (3Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 4Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The five subunits cross the membrane and form a ring around the ion channel in the center. Each subunit consists of a large hydrophilic N terminus, four transmembrane domains (TM) of 20–30 amino acids denoted M1–M4 (see Fig. 1), an intracellular loop between M3 and M4, and a short extracellular C terminus (5Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The M2 transmembrane domain (TM2) from each subunit lines the channel pore in the closed state conformation, whereas TM1 and TM2 contribute to the formation of the ion channel pore in the open state of the AChR (6Akabas M.H. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12496-12500Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). TM3 and TM4 segments are, however, in contact with membrane lipids, and photolabeling techniques have been used to identify the lipid-exposed residues of all of the AChR subunits (7Blanton M.P.

These mutations resulted in a substantial increase in channel open time and demonstrated the important role of these residues in the AChR channel gating.

Moreover, analysis of the changes in AChR function and expression as a function of the mutation position or periodicity has given valuable information used to predict the secondary structure of various transmembrane domains of the AChR. The periodicity for αTM3-TM4 and βTM3 are all consistent with a helical structure for these transmembrane domains (17Tamamizu S. Guzman G.R. Santiago J. Rojas L.V. McNamee M.G. Lasalde-Dominicci J.A.

The purpose of this study is to determine the role of the γTM4 transmembrane domain on the AChR function and to use the data gathered to make predictions about the secondary structure of γTM4. Eleven residues in the middle of γTM4, Cys451–Gly462, were selected for this study. Two of these residues, Cys451 and Ser460, have been reported to be exposed to the membrane lipids (7Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We expressed WT and mutated AChRs in Xenopus oocytes. The nAChR expression was determined using [125I]α-BTX binding assays, and functional studies were performed using two electrode voltage clamp to determine ACh-induced currents. We found that mutations L456W, F459W, and G462W resulted in a significant increase in nAChR expression when compared with that of WT. The rest of the mutations showed nAChR expression levels similar to WT. All of the mutations that increased nAChR expression and A455W produced an increase in function, as evidenced by a decrease in EC50 relative to WT. Seven mutations, I454W, A455W, L456W, L457W, F459W, I461W, and G462W resulted in an increase in macroscopic response (Imax) relative to WT. Mutations I454W, A455W, L457W, and L458W caused a significant increase in the normalized macroscopic response (Imax/fmol) induced by ACh. The average periodicity calculated for nAChR expression, EC50, and Imax suggest a helical secondary structure for γTM4.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutations in the γTM4 Transmembrane Domain—A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to replace the existing amino acids with tryptophan, at positions 451–462 of the γ subunit of the AChR. The PCR product was used to transform Epicurian coli XL1 supercompetent cells. The DNA was then purified using a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced to ensure a successful mutation.nAChR Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—mRNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro. The mRNA transcripts for α, β, γ, and δ subunits were microinjected into X. laevis oocytes at a 2:2:1:1 ratio. The volume of mRNA mix injected was varied depending upon the concentration of the mRNA mix.Voltage Clamp on Xenopus Oocytes—ACh-induced currents were recorded 3 days after mRNA microinjection using a two-electrode voltage clamp. The electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl (resistance, <2 mΩ). Impaled oocytes were perfused at a rate of 0.5 ml/s with MOR-2 buffer (82 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm HEPES, and 0.2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The membrane potential of each oocyte was clamped at -70 mV during the experiment. The membrane currents were digitized and filtered at 2 kHz using an Axon DigiData interface (Axon Instruments) and recorded using the Whole Cell Analysis Program, version 3.2.9 (provided by John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, UK). This program is installed on a Pentium III-based computer. Dose-response data were collected from peak currents (I) observed for each of the six ACh concentrations used (1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μm). The GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Incorporated, San Diego, CA) was used to perform a nonlinear regression fit with a sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation,I=Imin+(Imax−Imin/1+10(LogEC50−Log[ACh])×Hill Slope) eq.1 where I is the macroscopic current at a given ACh concentration, Imin and Imax are the smallest and the largest current observed, respectively, EC50 is the concentration required to achieve half-maximal response, and the Hill Slope is the slope of the linear portion of the sigmoidal curve.[125I]α-Bungarotoxin Binding Assay—We performed [125I]α-bungarotoxin (Amersham Biosciences) binding assays to determine the membrane expression of AChR in oocytes. The oocytes were incubated in 10 nm [125I]α-bungarotoxin with 5 mg/ml albumin serum bovine in MOR-2 without EGTA at room temperature for 1.5 h. Noninjected oocytes were also incubated in [125I]α-bungarotoxin to measure nonspecific binding (Beckman Gamma 5500). Excess toxin was removed by washing each oocyte with 15 ml of MOR-2 without EGTA. A standard curve was obtained by plotting the counts/min against [125I]α-bungarotoxin concentration (0.5–20 fmol). The equation for the linear regression obtained from this graph of counts/min versus volume (μl) was used to calculate the AChR expression (fmol) present in the membrane of each oocyte. The nAChR expression was determined for two groups of oocytes. One of these groups consists of oocytes used in the dose-response experiments, whereas the other group of oocytes belonged to experiments performed solely to calculate nAChR expression as a function of mutation. The nAChR expression value for the first group of oocytes was used to calculate the normalized channel response to ACh for each mutation, which is defined as the ACh-induced current in nanoamperes divided by femtomole of surface α-bungarotoxin binding. The expression calculated for the second group of oocytes was used to plot nAChR expression as a function of mutation along the γTM4 domain.Statistical Analysis—We compared nAChR expression level (fmol), EC50, Hill coefficient, and maximal current values between wild type and each mutation. The data were analyzed using the SPSS general linear model procedure for one-way analysis of variance to perform planned comparisons between these groups.Calculation of Periodicity for Both nAChR Expression and EC50—The expression of each mutant was normalized to the change in amino acid volume (Å3) caused by each tryptophan substitution. Tryptophan being the largest amino acid, this change corresponds to the volume of tryptophan (Å3) minus the volume of the WT amino acid replaced with tryptophan. The amino acid volumes used in this study were obtained from the calculations of Chothia (28Chothia C. Nature. 1975; 254: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). We then constructed plots of the normalized nAChR expression values as a function of their position along the γTM4 domain. Separate plots were created using EC50 and macroscopic response (Imax) values, for both WT and mutants, as a function of residue in the γTM4 domain. A cubic spline function (GraphPad Software Incorporated, San Diego, CA) was found to best fit the fluctuations induced by the tryptophan replacements, in normalized nAChR expression, EC50, and Imax data. To calculate the periodicity, we first determined the amino acid positions in which the first derivative of the cubic spline function is zero and then calculated the distance between the zeros.Topological Representation of the γTM4 —The structural model for the γ subunit presented in Fig. 6 corresponds to that proposed by Miyazawa et al. (9Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). This structure was downloaded from the NCBI Structure data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=structure). The structure was then exported to DS ViewerPro 5.0 (Accelrys; www.accelrys.com) and edited for publication.Fig. 6nAChR expression and functional data illustrated using the γ subunit model proposed by Miyazawa et al. (9Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). TM domains 1–4 of the γ subunit are displayed as gray α-helices and marked as M1–M4. Cys451 and Ser460 (green) have been proposed to be lipid-exposed (8Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Tryptophan replacement at residue Leu458 (red) resulted in a moderate increase in EC50. An increase in nAChR expression, decreased EC50, and increased macroscopic response were detected when tryptophan was introduced in residues Leu456, Phe459, and Gly462 (blue). Tryptophan replacement in residues Ile454, Ala455, Leu457, and Ile461 (blue) resulted in increased macroscopic and/or normalized macroscopic response. A, view from top of γTM4.

[125I]α-BTX binding assays were performed 3 days after injection to determine the effect of each mutation on the nAChR expression level of AChR. The results of these binding assays are summarized in Fig. 2. The average WT expression was 1.8 ± 0.4 fmol (Fig. 2). Three of the mutations studied, L456W, F459W, and G462W exhibited nAChR expression levels significantly higher than that of WT. Specifically, L456, F459W, and G462W resulted in 1.6-, 2.0-, and 1.7-fold increases in nAChR expression, respectively (Fig. 2). The rest of the mutations resulted in expression levels similar to that of WT, thus suggesting that the secondary structure of γTM4 is loose enough to accommodate a large hydrophobic amino acid, such as tryptophan, without major consequences to the AChR assembly. Moreover, the increase in nAChR expression detected for three of the mutants suggests that, at those positions, tryptophan facilitates the AChR assembly and/or oligomerization. The tryptophan scanning results obtained with γTM4 are in contrast with those found with αTM4 (17Tamamizu S. Guzman G.R. Santiago J. Rojas L.V. McNamee M.G. Lasalde-Dominicci J.A.

Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3738-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2859-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The purpose of these studies is to determine the role of γTM4 on channel function and to assess the role that lipid-protein interactions may have on the AChR function. We used the two electrode voltage clamp technique to determine the dose response for ACh, using ACh concentrations ranging from 1 to 300 μm. Fig. 3 illustrates representative current traces induced by the different ACh concentrations used for both mutants and WT. All of the mutations studied yielded functional AchRs, and some mutations (e.g. I454W, A455W, and L456W) resulted in a gain in function (Fig. 3). Table I contains the average maximal current (Imax) or current induced by 300 μm for each oocyte. Mutations I454W, A455W, L456W, L457W, F459W, I461W, and G462W resulted in macroscopic response (Imax) values significantly higher than that of WT, with n-fold values ranging from 2.3–3.4-fold. When the Imax values were normalized to the nAChR expression level (fmol) for each oocyte (normalized macroscopic response), mutations I454W, A455W, L457W, and F458W were found to display normalized currents significantly higher than WT, with n-fold increase values of 3.4-, 10.7-, 7.0-, and 4.5-fold, respectively. No mutation resulted in a decrease of either Imax of Imax/fmol. These results contrast our previously reported findings with αTM4 (17Tamamizu S. Guzman G.R. Santiago J. Rojas L.V. McNamee M.G.

https://openalex.org/W2136785685,"Human apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II) intron 2/exon 3 junction shows a peculiar tract of alternating pyrimidines and purines (GU tract) that makes the acceptor site deviate significantly from the consensus. However, apoA-II exon 3 is constitutively included in mRNA. We have studied this unusual exon definition by creating a construct with the genomic fragment encompassing the whole gene from apoA-II and its regulatory regions. Transient transfections in Hep3B cells have shown that deletion or replacement of the GU repeats at the 3' splice site resulted in a decrease of apoA-II exon 3 inclusion, indicating a possible role of the GU tract in splicing. However, a 3' splice site composed of the GU tract in heterologous context, such as the extra domain A of human fibronectin or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator exon 9, resulted in total skipping of the exons. Next, we identified the exonic cis-acting elements that may affect the splicing efficiency of apoA-II exon 3 and found that the region spanning from nucleotide 87 to 113 of human apoA-II exon 3 is essential for its inclusion in the mRNA. Overlapping deletions and point mutations (between nucleotides 91 and 102) precisely defined an exonic splicing enhancer (ESEwt). UV cross-linking assays followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-SR protein monoclonal antibodies showed that ESEwt, but not mutated ESE RNA, was able to bind both alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2 and SC35. Furthermore, overexpression of both splicing factors enhanced exon 3 inclusion. These results show that this protein-ESE interaction is able to promote the incorporation of exon 3 in mRNA and suggest that they can rescue the splicing despite the noncanonical 3' splice site."
https://openalex.org/W2109712011,"Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase-catalyzed condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA requires enolization/carbanion formation from the acetyl C-2 methyl group prior to formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. Acetyldithio-CoA, a readily enolizable analog of acetyl-CoA, was an effective competitive inhibitor of avian hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (<i>K<sub>i</sub></i> = 28 μm). In the absence of cosubstrate, enzyme catalyzed the enolization/proton exchange from the C-2 methyl group of acetyldithio-CoA. Mutant enzymes that exhibited impaired formation of the covalent acetyl-S-enzyme reaction intermediate exhibited diminished (D159A and D203A) or undetectable (C129S) rates of enolization of acetyldithio-CoA. The results suggest that covalent thioacetylation of protein, which has not been detected previously for other enzymes that enolize this analog, occurs with hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase. Enzyme catalyzed the transfer of the thioacetyl group of this analog to 3′-dephospho-CoA suggesting the intermediacy of a covalent thioacetyl-S-enzyme species, which appears to be important for proton abstraction from C-2 of the thioacetyl group. Avian enzyme glutamate 95 is crucial to substrate condensation to form a new carboncarbon bond. Mutations of this invariant residue (avian enzyme E95A and E95Q; <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> enzyme E79Q) correlated with diminished ability to catalyze enolization of acetyldithio-CoA. Enolization by E95Q was not stimulated in the presence of acetoacetyl-CoA. These observations suggest either a direct (proton abstraction) or indirect (solvent polarization) role for this active site glutamate."
