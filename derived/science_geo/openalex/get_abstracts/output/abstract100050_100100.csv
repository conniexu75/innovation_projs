https://openalex.org/W2015357935,"Most cases of cystic fibrosis are caused by mutations that interfere with the biosynthetic folding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), leading to the rapid degradation of CFTR molecules that have not matured beyond the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mechanism by which integral membrane proteins including CFTR are recognized and targeted for ER degradation and the proteolytic machinery involved in this process are not well understood. We show here that the degradation of both wild-type and mutant CFTR is inhibited by two potent proteasome inhibitors that induce the accumulation of polyubiquitinated forms of immature CFTR. CFTR degradation was also inhibited by coexpression of a dominant negative ubiquitin mutant and in cells bearing a temperature-sensitive mutation in the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, confirming that ubiquitination is required for rapid CFTR degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2040773128,"The cellular interactions that control the differentiation of dorsal cell types from neural progenitors have been examined in neural plate explants. Certain genes that are expressed in the dorsal neural tube are initially expressed uniformly within the neural plate and appear to achieve their dorsal restriction through a Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-mediated repressive signal from the notochord. The acquisition of definitive dorsal cell fates, however, requires a contact-dependent signal from the epidermal ectoderm. BMP4 and BMP7 are expressed in the epidermal ectoderm, and both proteins mimic its inductive activity. BMP4 and a related gene, DSL1, are subsequently expressed by cells in the dorsal neural tube. The differentiation of dorsal cell types, therefore, appears to be initiated at the neural plate stage and to involve the opponent activities of a BMP-mediated dorsalizing signal from the epidermal ectoderm and a SHH-mediated ventralizing signal from the notochord."
https://openalex.org/W2137333423,"Erythropoietin (EPO) is the principal growth factor regulating the production of circulating erythrocytes. We introduced null mutations into both Epo and the EPO receptor (EpoR) gene. Both heterozygotes appeared normal. Homozygous animals exhibited reduced primitive erythropoiesis and died around embryonic day 13, owing to failure of definitive fetal liver erythropoiesis. Both types of mutations exhibited identical phenotypes, indicating that EPO and the EPOR are crucial for definitive erythropoiesis in vivo and that no other ligands or receptors can replace them. Committed erythroid BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors were present in both homozygous fetal livers. Thus, neither EPO nor the EPOR is required for erythroid lineage commitment or for the proliferation and differentiation of BFU-E to CFU-E progenitors. EPO and the EPOR are crucial in vivo for the proliferation and survival of CFU-E progenitors and their irreversible terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2005271852,"Hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis (ODG) with normal karyotype is a heterogeneous condition that in some cases displays Mendelian recessive inheritance. By systematically searching for linkage in multiplex affected families, we mapped a locus for ODG to chromosome 2p. As the previously cloned follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene had been assigned to 2p, we searched it for mutations. A C566T transition in exon 7 of FSHR predicting an Ala to Val substitution at residue 189 in the extracellular ligand-binding domain segregated perfectly with the disease phenotype. Expression of the gene in transfected cells demonstrated a dramatic reduction of binding capacity and signal transduction, but apparently normal ligand-binding affinity of the mutated receptor. We conclude that the mutation causes ODG in these families."
https://openalex.org/W2049627175,"Transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human (Hu) and chimeric prion protein (PrP) genes were inoculated with brain extracts from humans with inherited or sporadic prion disease to investigate the mechanism by which PrPC is transformed into PrPSc. Although Tg(HuPrP) mice expressed high levels of HuPrPC, they were resistant to human prions. They became susceptible to human prions upon ablation of the mouse (Mo) PrP gene. In contrast, mice expressing low levels of the chimeric transgene were susceptible to human prions and registered only a modest decrease in incubation times upon MoPrP gene disruption. These and other findings argue that a species-specific macromolecule, provisionally designated protein X, participates in prion formation. While the results demonstrate that PrPSc binds to PrPC in a region delimited by codons 96 to 167, they also suggest that PrPC binds protein X through residues near the C-terminus. Protein X might function as a molecular chaperone in the formation of PrPSc."
https://openalex.org/W2092371719,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, spinocerebellar tracts, and selective brainstem neurons owing to the expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of the SCA1 mutation and the intergenerational stability of trinucleotide repeats in mice, we have generated transgenic mice expressing the human SCA1 gene with either a normal or an expanded CAG tract. Both transgenes were stable in parent to offspring transmissions. While all six transgenic lines expressing the unexpanded human SCA1 allele had normal Purkinje cells, transgenic animals from five of six lines with the expanded SCA1 allele developed ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration. These data indicate that expanded CAG repeats expressed in Purkinje cells are sufficient to produce degeneration and ataxia and demonstrate that a mouse model can be established for neurodegeneration caused by CAG repeat expansions."
https://openalex.org/W2088234686,"Batten disease (also known as juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder of childhood characterized by progressive loss of vision, seizures, and psychomotor disturbances. The Batten disease gene, CLN3, maps to chromosome 16p12.1. The so-called 56 chromosome haplotype defined by alleles at the D16S299 and D16S298 loci is shared by 73% of Batten disease chromosomes. Exon amplification of a cosmid containing D16S298 has yielded a candidate gene that is disrupted by a 1 kb genomic deletion in all patients carrying the 56 chromosome. Two separate deletions and a point mutation altering a splice site in three unrelated families have confirmed the candidate as the CLN3 gene. The disease gene encodes a novel 438 amino acid protein of unknown function."

Previous studies have shown that sialylation and fucosylation of PSGL-1 are required for its binding to P-selectin, but other post-translational modifications of PSGL-1 may also be important. We demonstrate that PSGL-1 synthesized in human HL-60 cells can be metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate that is incorporated primarily into tyrosine sulfate. Treatment of PSGL-1 with a bacterial arylsulfatase releases sulfate from tyrosine, resulting in a concordant decrease in binding to P-selectin. These studies demonstrate that tyrosine sulfate on PSGL-1 functions in conjunction with sialylated and fucosylated glycans to mediate high affinity binding to P-selectin.

PSGL-1 is a homodimeric glycoprotein with two disulfide-bonded 120-kDa subunits (7Moore K.L. Stults N.L. Diaz S. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Varki A. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 445-456Google Scholar). The cDNA-derived sequence for PSGL-1 predicts a type 1 transmembrane protein of 402 amino acids(8Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M.

The extracellular domain has an N-terminal signal peptide from residues 1-18 and a putative propeptide from residues 19-41. Assuming cleavage of the propeptide, the extracellular domain of the mature protein begins at residue 42 and extends to residue 308. The sequence concludes with a 25-residue transmembrane domain and a 69-residue cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain is rich in serines and threonines that are potential sites for O-glycosylation. There are also three potential N-glycosylation sites and three potential tyrosine sulfation sites at residues 46, 48, and 51(8Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D. Larsen G.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Google Scholar). PSGL-1 must be sialylated and fucosylated to bind P-selectin(7Moore K.L. Stults N.L.

Ushiyama S. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. Varki A. J. Biol.

Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23318-23327Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, that sLex or related glycans are sufficient for high affinity binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin. For example, sulfated compounds lacking either sialic acid or fucose can inhibit adhesion of leukocytes to P-selectin(14Aruffo A. Kolanus W. Walz G. Fredman P. Seed B.

We demonstrate that PSGL-1 is sulfated, primarily on tyrosine residues. Furthermore, tyrosine sulfation of PSGL-1 is required for high affinity binding to P-selectin. Carrier-free [35S]sulfate (1100-1600 mCi/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Emphaze™ affinity support resin was purchased from Pierce. Aerobacter aerogenes arylsulfatase, Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase, and sulfated monosaccharides were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant peptide:N-glycosidase F was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Authentic tyrosine sulfate was synthesized as described (18Huttner W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 200-224Google Scholar) using concentrated H2SO4 and tyrosine. Other chemicals were ACS grade or better and were obtained from Fisher Scientific. PSGL-1 was purified from human neutrophils and radiolabeled with Na125I as described (13Moore K.L. Eaton S.F.

HL-60 cells (2-5 × 105 cells/ml) were labeled for 48 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate at 37°C in sulfate-deficient medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. 3H-PSGL-1 was prepared by metabolic labeling of HL-60 cells with [3H]glucosamine as described(7Moore K.L.

Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15229-15237Google Scholar) coupled to Emphaze™ at a density of 5 mg/ml(13Moore K.L. Eaton S.F. Lyons D.E. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23318-23327Google Scholar). The enriched EDTA-eluted samples were rechromatographed on the P-selectin column after dialysis into Ca2+-containing buffer. Purified 35S-PSGL-1 was treated with reducing or nonreducing SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel(20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Gels were dried and then exposed to Fuji RX x-ray film at −80°C. Tyrosine sulfation of PSGL-1 was determined by base hydrolysis of 35S-PSGL-1. Following identification of 35S-PSGL-1 by autoradiography, the dried gel was aligned with the exposed x-ray film, and the band from the nonreducing lane was subjected to strong base hydrolysis in 1.0 M NaOH at 110°C, for 24 h as described(21Hortin G. Tollefsen D.M. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15827-15830Google Scholar). The hydrolysate was passed over a Dowex 50 (H+) column washed with water, lyophilized, and analyzed by anion exchange chromatography using a Varian AX-5 column (4 mm × 30 cm) that was eluted with a gradient of NaH2PO4, pH 3.0. Tyrosine sulfate was also detected using descending paper chromatography as described(22Dodgson K.S. Rose F.A. Tudball N. Biochem. J. 1959; 71: 10-15Google Scholar). Briefly, authentic standards were separated on Whatman No. 1 cellulose paper using 1-butanol:acetic acid:water (125:30:125) for 18 h. Tyrosine and tyrosine sulfate were detected with 0.25% ninhydrin/acetone, and sulfated monosaccharides were detected by silver stain(23Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. Schneider W.J. Hobgood K.K. Tolleshaug H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15261-15273Google Scholar). All arylsulfatase digestions were performed with A. aerogenes arylsulfatase (EC 3.1.6.1) (24Fowler L.R. Rammler D.H. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 230-237Google Scholar) in approximately 500 μl of 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, overnight at 37°C. Following digestion, the enzyme reactions were terminated by boiling for 15 min. Sham digestions were performed with 1000 milliunits of boiled enzyme. [35S]Tyrosine sulfate from 35S-PSGL-1 was prepared by base hydrolysis as described above. The base hydrolysate was treated with 50 or 1000 milliunits of active arylsulfatase or with 1000 milliunits of boiled arylsulfatase, then analyzed by anion exchange chromatography. The specificity of the A. aerogenes arylsulfatase was determined for the sulfated monosaccharides GlcNAc-6-sulfate, Gal-6-sulfate, GalNAc-6-sulfate, and GalNAc-4-sulfate. Each of the sulfated monosaccharides (100 nmol) was treated separately with 1000 milliunits of boiled or active enzyme. After overnight incubation, the reaction mixtures were boiled for 15 min, lyophilized, resuspended in water, and analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography with a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 column and PAD detection as described(25Shilatifard A. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 291-297Google Scholar). Intact 35S-PSGL-1, 125I-PSGL-1, or 3H-PSGL-1 was treated with A. aerogenes arylsulfatase as described above. The [35S]sulfate released from 35S-PSGL-1 by arylsulfatase was quantified by BaSO4 precipitation, in which 100 μl of saturated BaCl2 was added to the reaction mixture with 10 μl of saturated Na2SO3 as a carrier(26Shilatifard A. Merkle R.M. Helland D.E. Welles J.L. Haseltine W.A. Cummings R.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 943-952Google Scholar). In the graphic representation of the data, the sulfate released from the sham-treated sample was adjusted setting the sham-treated sample equal to 0%. The actual percentage of radioactivity released from the sham-treated samples ranged from 1.3-5.0%. 35S-PSGL-1 was treated with peptide:N-glycosidase F as described(26Shilatifard A. Merkle R.M. Helland D.E. Welles J.L. Haseltine W.A. Cummings R.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 943-952Google Scholar). 35S-PSGL-1 was denatured by boiling 5 min in 50 μl of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% SDS. The SDS was then diluted to a final concentration of 0.2% with 1.5% Nonidet P-40. 10 units of enzyme was added to the denatured 35S-PSGL-1 and incubated overnight at 37°C. In a control experiment, 125I-PSGL-1 was treated with 100 milliunits of A. ureafaciens neuraminidase in 0.05 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, overnight at 37°C prior to application to a CSLEX-1 antibody column. Chromatography on CSLEX-1 was performed as described previously(13Moore K.L. Eaton S.F. Lyons D.E. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23318-23327Google Scholar). Arylsulfatase-treated 125I-PSGL-1 and 3H-PSGL-1 were applied to a P-selectin affinity column in Ca2+-containing buffer, and the bound radioactivity was eluted with EDTA. The percentage of PSGL-1 eluted from the column with EDTA was corrected setting the sham-treated sample equal to 100% (actual rebinding ranged from 87-99%). Immunoprecipitation of 35S-PSGL-1 was performed as described (13Moore K.L. Eaton S.F. Lyons D.E. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol.

The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, followed by autoradiography. To determine if PSGL-1 is post-translationally sulfated, human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate, and PSGL-1 was purified from lysates of these cells by affinity chromatography on a P-selectin column. A [35S]sulfate-labeled protein was detected that migrated in SDS gels with a relative molecular mass of 120,000 under reducing conditions and 240,000 under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1). These mobilities are consistent with the disulfide-linked homodimeric structure of PSGL-1(7Moore K.L. Stults N.L. Diaz S. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Varki A. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 445-456Google Scholar). Furthermore, the [35S]sulfate-labeled protein was immunoprecipitated with a specific rabbit antiserum generated against a synthetic peptide encoding residues 42-56 of the extracellular domain of PSGL-1 (13Moore K.L. Eaton S.F. Lyons D.E. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23318-23327Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Analysis of the supernatants showed that anti-42-56 precipitated all of the 35S-PSGL-1, whereas NRS precipitated none of the 35S-PSGL-1 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that PSGL-1 is post-translationally sulfated. Sulfate can be incorporated into eukaryotic glycoproteins as tyrosine sulfate (27Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Mod. Cell Biol. 1988; 6: 97-140Google Scholar) or as sulfated carbohydrates(28Fiete D. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J. Cell. 1991; 65: 1103-1110Google Scholar, 29Kjellan L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Google Scholar). In preliminary studies we failed to detect sulfated carbohydrates on PSGL-1, using techniques that detected such structures on other glycoproteins(25Shilatifard A. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 291-297Google Scholar, 26Shilatifard A. Merkle R.M. Helland D.E. Welles J.L. Haseltine W.A. Cummings R.D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 943-952Google Scholar). We then considered the possibility that PSGL-1 might contain tyrosine sulfate. The cDNA sequence of PSGL-1 predicts four extracytoplasmic tyrosine residues(8Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D. Larsen G.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Google Scholar), three of which are clustered at positions 46, 48, and 51 within a predicted consensus sequence for tyrosine sulfation(27Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Mod. Cell Biol. 1988; 6: 97-140Google Scholar). To determine if PSGL-1 has tyrosine sulfate, the gel slice containing the 240-kDa 35S-PSGL-1 was hydrolyzed with strong base and analyzed by both anion exchange chromatography and descending paper chromatography. In both systems, a single radioactive peak was recovered that comigrated with authentic tyrosine sulfate (Fig. 2, A and B). No radioactivity was recovered that comigrated with sulfated monosaccharide standards. We sought to test whether tyrosine sulfate is important for binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin. Although the functions of tyrosine sulfate within proteins are not clear(27Huttner W.B. Baeuerle P.A. Mod. Cell Biol. 1988; 6: 97-140Google Scholar), some proteins require this modification for optimal activity(30Pittman D.D. Wang J.H. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3315-3325Google Scholar, 31Dong J.-F. Li C.Q. Lopez J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13946-13953Google Scholar). The usual approach for assessing the importance of tyrosine sulfate is to prevent sulfation of newly synthesized proteins with chemical inhibitors or to replace tyrosine with phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis. We developed an alternative approach in which sulfate was enzymatically removed from tyrosine on intact PSGL-1. We first tested the ability of an arylsulfatase from A. aerogenes to release sulfate from [35S]tyrosine sulfate. Treatment of the hydrolysate of 35S-PSGL-1 with 1000 milliunits of arylsulfatase quantitatively released [35S]sulfate from [35S]tyrosine sulfate (Fig. 3, A and B). In other experiments, as little as 50 milliunits of this arylsulfatase also quantitatively released [35S]sulfate from [35S]tyrosine sulfate derived from PSGL-1 (data not shown). Cleavage by arylsulfatase was specific, since 1000 milliunits of the enzyme did not release sulfate from Gal-6-sulfate, GlcNAc-6-sulfate, GalNAc-4-sulfate, and GalNAc-6-sulfate (data not shown). We then examined the ability of the arylsulfatase to release sulfate from intact PSGL-1 and the effect of this release on rebinding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin. [35S]sulfate released from 35S-PSGL-1 by arylsulfatase was quantified by precipitation as insoluble BaSO4. Up to 50% of the [35S]sulfate on 35S-PSGL-1 was released by 500 milliunits of arylsulfatase; increasing amounts of enzyme did not release more radioactivity (Fig. 4A). The functional importance of the tyrosine sulfate on PSGL-1 was assessed by treating both 3H-PSGL-1 from HL-60 cells and 125I-PSGL-1 from human neutrophils with arylsulfatase and measuring the rebinding of the treated ligands to a P-selectin column. Binding of both arylsulfatase-treated 3H-PSGL-1 and 125I-PSGL-1 to P-selectin was reduced in a dose-dependent manner; the decreased binding was inversely related to the amount of sulfate released from 35S-PSGL-1 (Fig. 4A). The reduced binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin following arylsulfatase treatment was not due to general release of sialic acid and/or fucose by contaminating exoglycosidases, because PSGL-1 treated with 1000 milliunits of arylsulfatase bound quantitatively to an affinity column containing CSLEX-1, a monoclonal antibody to sLex (data not shown). Arylsulfatase released ≈50% of the [35S]sulfate from 35S-PSGL-1 and decreased rebinding of 3H-PSGL-1 and 125I-PSGL-1 to P-selectin by the same degree. We considered the possibility that the fraction of 35S-PSGL-1 that rebound to P-selectin following treatment with arylsulfatase retained critical tyrosine sulfate residues, whereas the fraction that did not rebind to P-selectin had lost tyrosine sulfate. 35S-PSGL-1 was treated with 1000 milliunits of arylsulfatase and then applied to a P-selectin column. The bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B). A band corresponding to 35S-PSGL-1 was observed in the bound fractions, whereas no band was seen in the unbound fractions. The radioactivity in the unbound fractions represented free sulfate. When the band of 35S-PSGL-1 in the bound fractions was hydrolyzed, radioactivity was recovered in tyrosine sulfate (data not shown). In the control experiment, 125I-PSGL-1 was treated with 1000 milliunits of arylsulfatase and then applied to the P-selectin column. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that intact 125I-PSGL-1 was recovered in both the unbound and bound fractions (Fig. 4B). Thus, arylsulfatase removed sulfate quantitatively from a subset of PSGL-1, which no longer bound P-selectin, but the enzyme did not otherwise degrade PSGL-1. The tyrosine sulfate remaining in the P-selectin-bound subset of PSGL-1 may be resistant to arylsulfatase because of its inaccessibility or because of some other feature of PSGL-1 that blocks action of the enzyme. When 35S-PSGL was partly deglycosylated by treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F and A. ureafaciens neuraminidase, subsequent treatment with arylsulfatase released up to 70% of the radioactivity as [35S]sulfate (data not shown). Since neuraminidase also eliminates binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin, we could not determine whether the increased removal of [35S]sulfate further reduced binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin. These results suggest that the extensive glycosylation of PSGL-1 may account for the inaccessibility of some tyrosine sulfate sites to arylsulfatase. These results demonstrate that PSGL-1 contains tyrosine sulfate that is required for high affinity binding to P-selectin. It has been shown previously that PSGL-1 contains the sLex determinant on O-linked oligosaccharides and that both sialic acid and fucose are required for binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin(7Moore K.L.

Tyrosine sulfate may be important because it promotes appropriate presentation of the glycans that bind directly to P-selectin. Alternatively, tyrosine sulfate may directly interact with P-selectin. This latter possibility seems more likely, since sulfatide and sulfated oligosaccharides are known to bind P-selectin(14Aruffo A. Kolanus W. Walz G. Fredman P. Seed B. Cell. 1991; 67: 35-44Google Scholar, 15Nelson R.M. Cecconi O. Roberts W.G. Aruffo A. Linhardt R.J. Bevilacqua M.P. Blood. 1993; 82: 3253-3258Google Scholar, 16Cecconi O. Nelson R.M. Roberts W.G.

Bernt M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 1373-1379Google Scholar). Sulfate is also a critical determinant for the binding of GlyCAM-1 to L-selectin, but GlyCAM-1 contains sulfate in Gal-6-sulfate and GlcNAc-6-sulfate (32Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D. Nature. 1993; 361: 555-557Google Scholar, 33Hemmerich S. Bertozzi C.R. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4820-4829Google Scholar, 34Hemmerich S. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12035-12047Google Scholar). In contrast, PSGL-1 is sulfated primarily on tyrosine rather than on monosaccharides. Our results suggest a model in which PSGL-1 presents both carbohydrate and tyrosine sulfate as components of a critical recognition site for P-selectin. We hypothesize that this site is located at the N-terminal, membrane-distal region of PSGL-1, near the three potentially sulfated tyrosine residues. Consistent with this hypothesis, PL1, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a membrane-distal epitope on PSGL-1, blocks binding of fluid-phase P-selectin to leukocytes and abolishes adhesion of neutrophils to P-selectin under both static and shear conditions (5Moore K.L. Patel K.D. Bruehl R.E. Li F. Johnson D.A. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. Bainton D.F. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 661-671Google Scholar). In contrast, PL2, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a membrane-proximal epitope on PSGL-1, does not inhibit binding to P-selectin(5Moore K.L. Patel K.D. Bruehl R.E. Li F. Johnson D.A. Lichenstein H.S. Cummings R.D. Bainton D.F. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 661-671Google Scholar). The concept that P-selectin recognizes a localized site on a mucin-like glycoprotein is in contrast to a model in which a selectin recognizes multiple, clustered O-linked glycans attached along the entire polypeptide(35Lasky L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2065630930,"Biological function of the BCR-ABL oncogene is dependent on its activated tyrosine kinase. Mutations that inactivate the SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain, the GRB2-binding site in BCR, or the major autophosphorylation site of the kinase domain selectively disrupt downstream signaling but not tyrosine kinase activity. Despite a loss of fibroblast transformation activity, all three mutants retain the ability to render hematopoietic cell lines growth factor independent and transform primary bone marrow cells in vitro. In vivo tests of malignant potential reveal a most critical role for signals dependent on the BCR-ABL SH2 domain. The efficiency of both fibroblast and hematopoietic transformation by BCR-ABL is strongly affected by increased dosage of the SHC adapter protein, which can connect tyrosine kinase signals to RAS. The BCR-ABL oncogene activates multiple alternative pathways to RAS for hematopoietic transformation."

It belongs to a family of homologous peptides including the gut peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide. NPY has been highly conserved throughout evolution and is therefore thought to be an important hormone/neurotransmitter. Centrally its effects include blood pressure regulation, memory enhancement, anxiolysis/sedation, and increased food intake, and in the periphery it affects vascular and other smooth muscle activity, intestinal electrolyte secretion, and urinary sodium excretion(1Hazlewood R.L.

Heterogeneity among NPY receptors has been observed. Based on the rank order of potency of NPY and related peptides to displace 125I-NPY binding, NPY receptors have been classified into at least three receptor subtypes, Y1, Y2, and Y3(3Michel M.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 389-394Google Scholar). Both the Y1 and Y2 subtypes have high affinity for NPY and PYY. The Y1 subtype has a high affinity for the NPY analog [Leu31,Pro34]NPY and low affinity for C-terminal fragments of NPY such as NPY13-36. In contrast, the Y2 receptor subtype has high affinity for NPY13-36 and low affinity for [Leu31,Pro34]NPY. The Y3 subtype has a low affinity for PYY. The existence of a fourth receptor, Y1a or Y4, that is important in the feeding response has been hypothesized (2Colmers W.F. Wahlestedt C. The Biology of Neuropeptide Y and Related Peptides.

To date the cloning of a Y2 receptor has not been reported. Attempts to isolate a Y2 cDNA using homology to the Y1 cDNA have not been successful. Here we report the isolation by expression cloning (8Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Google Scholar) of a cDNA encoding a human NPY receptor displaying a pharmacology typical of a Y2 receptor. The clone has been functionally expressed in CHO cells where its activation causes mobilization of calcium and inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. An oriented expression cDNA library was prepared from SMS-KAN mRNA in the pcDNA1 vector. Approximately 2.5 × 105 COS-7 cells were seeded on to single-well Labteks™ (Nunc) and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA prepared from pools of bacterial clones from the library using Lipofectamine™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). Three days later the cells were washed twice with binding buffer A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% BSA). Following incubation with 100 pM125I-PYY (2200 Ci mmol-1, DuPont NEN) in buffer A at 37°C for 2 h, they were washed three times, air-dried, and autoradiographed. The one positive pool detected during the primary screening was subdivided and screened similarly until a pure clone was isolated. A BamHI and XbaI fragment of the pNPYR-398 clone, which contained the entire open reading frame for the receptor, was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector cut with the same enzymes. This resulting construct was linearized with PvuI and introduced into the CHO cells by electroporation (9Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Moren A. Severinsson L. Ek B. Ostman A. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.-H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 3476-3486Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser™. After 48 h the cells were placed in selection medium (Ham's F-12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mML-glutamine, and 300 μg/ml G418). Clones were picked after 3 weeks, expanded, and assayed for NPY receptor expression using a radioligand binding assay. COS-7 cells (5 × 104 cells/assay), transfected with the purified pNPYR-398 clone were incubated in a 96-well microtiter plate in 100 μl of binding buffer B (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5% BSA, 1 mg/ml of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin, 0.1% bacitracin, 5 mg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 pM125I-NPY (2200 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), with or without competitor, at room temperature with shaking. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 50 μl of the reaction mix into 600 μl of ice-cold binding buffer B. The quenched reaction mixture was centrifuged at 4°C for 20 min, the supernatant removed and the pellets were counted in a γ counter (Cobra, Packard Instrument Co.). The CHO cells stably expressing the NPY receptor (CHO-hY2) in a 24-well tissue culture plate (5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated in 250 μl of binding buffer C (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA) with 100 pM125I-PYY, with or without competitor, at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer C, suspended in 0.5 M NaOH, transferred to a counting tube, and counted in a γ counter. The competition binding and saturation binding data were analyzed by logistic.fit and hyperbola.fit programs of Sigma Plot, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of both strands of the cDNA insert was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (10Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) on an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated sequencer. The sequence data were analyzed using the GCG sequence analysis software package(11Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar). Human brain multiple tissue Northern blots (2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane) were purchased from Clontech. The blots were probed using standard molecular biology techniques(12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The BamHI/XbaI fragment of the pNPYR-398 cDNA clone described above was labeled to a specific activity of 5 × 108 cpm/μg with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming to be used as a probe. Hybridization was at 42°C in 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm, 50% formamide, and 2% SDS for 24 h with shaking. The membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature, followed by one wash in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50°C for 40 min and autoradiographed. Approximately 12 μg of human genomic DNA digested with BamHI or EcoRI were loaded on an 0.8% agarose gel in TAE, electrophoresed at about 1.75-2.0 V/cm for approximately 36 h and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Probe was prepared as described for the Northern blot. Hybridization was overnight at 37°C in 4 × SSC, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 7 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 40% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA with shaking. The membrane was washed thoroughly in 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by two 15-min washes in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C and autoradiography. CHO-hY2 in six-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well) were preincubated for 10 min at 37°C in media (Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum) containing 100 μM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. They were then treated with media (basal), forskolin (10 μM), peptide, or forskolin plus peptide (100 nM) for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction was quenched by incubation in 1 N HCl for 30 min at 4°C. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the samples were lyophilized. The cAMP content was determined by radioimmune assay (DuPont NEN). For experiments in which Gαi was inhibited, cells were incubated overnight in media containing 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin. CHO-hY2 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and loaded with Fura-2AM (Molecular Devices) in buffer D (Hank's balanced salt solution, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.2% BSA) for 45 min at 37°C. The cells were then washed with buffer D, suspended at 3 × 105 cells/ml, and placed in a Spex spectrofluorometer with submersible magnetic stirrer attachment. A stable base line was established at 340 nmex and 490 nmem before the NPY2-36 (1 μM), NPY13-36 (1 μM), MCP-1 (5 μM), or galanin (5 μM) was added and the fluorescence measured. Fluorescence maxima and minima were determined using Triton X-100 (1%) and EGTA (10 mM), respectively. Calcium mobilized was calculated according to McCormack and Cobbold(13McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar); the Kd value used was 224 nmol/liter. Neuropeptide Y is a peptide hormone with diverse and important physiological effects in the central nervous system and periphery that are mediated through multiple receptor subtypes. In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with these effects, we undertook the cloning of a human NPY Y2 receptor. A plasmid cDNA expression library was prepared from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from SMS-KAN cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line that expresses high levels of Y2 receptor(14Sheikh S.P. O'Hare M.M.T. Tortora O. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6648-6654Google Scholar). Plasmid library DNA was transfected into COS-7 cells that are null for NPY binding; the cells were assayed for NPY receptor expression by 125I-PYY binding. Detection was by autoradiography. A single pool (pool 398) was identified that had increased levels of 125I-PYY binding. This pool was subdivided and the process was repeated until a pure cDNA clone (pNPYR-398) was isolated. Binding of 125I-NPY and 125I-PYY to COS-7 cells transfected with pNPYR-398 was saturable and high affinity, with Kd values of 0.58 and 0.27 nM, respectively. Specific binding to COS-7 cells transfected with vector (pcDNA1) was negligible. Scatchard analysis suggests tha125I-NPY bound to a single class of binding sites in COS-7 cells transfected with pNPYR-398 cDNA (data not shown). To characterize the pharmacology of the NPY receptor encoded by pNPYR-398 cDNA, 125I-NPY (100 pM) binding to COS-7 cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid was competed with various NPY analogs (Fig. 1). PYY, NPY, and NPY2-36 were the most effective competitors of 125I-NPY binding, followed by the Y2-specific agonist NPY13-36 (Table 1). The Y1-specific agonist [Leu31,Pro34]NPY inhibited 125I-NPY binding only at high concentration with an IC32Trp]NPY, a competitive antagonist of NPY in rat hypothalamus(15Balasubramaniam A. Sheriff S. Johnson M.E. Prabhakaran M. Huang Y. Fischer J.E. Chance W.T. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 811-815Google Scholar), inhibited 125I-NPY binding with an IC50 of 2.9 μM. The rank order of potency of NPY and related peptides to COS-7 cells expressing the NPY receptor cDNA is PYY ≥ NPY ≥ NPY2-36 > NPY3-36 > NPY13-36 [Leu31,Pro34]NPY > [D-Trp32]NPY. To further confirm the characteristics of pNPYR-398 NPY receptor, the potency of the NPY analogs to this receptor in competing for 125I-PYY to COS-7 cells transfected with pNPYR-398 was studied. The results were similar to those described for 125I-NPY binding (Table 1). These data are consistent with the previously reported pharmacology for the Y2 subtype of NPY receptors(3Michel M.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 389-394Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows the nucleotide sequence of the pNPYR-398 cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence for the encoded NPY Y2 receptor. The nucleotide sequence surrounding the initiation codon agrees well with Kozak's consensus sequences(16Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8130Google Scholar). The receptor is 381 amino acids in length and has a molecular mass of approximately 42 kDa. Hydrophobicity analyses determined according to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (17Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar) suggest the existence of seven transmembrane-spanning regions. There is a single putative N-linked glycosylation site in the N-terminal region. There is an aspartic acid in the putative second transmembrane region that is conserved in many G-protein-coupled receptors and frequently involved with signal transduction(18Rose P.M. Krystek S.R. Patel P.S. Liu E.C.-K. Lynch J.S. Lach D.A. Fisher S.M. Webb M.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 243-249Google Scholar). In the C-terminal tail there is a cysteine residue that might be involved in palmitolyation (19O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Google Scholar) as well as several serine residues that might be involved in regulatory phosphorylation. A long polyadenylation signal was found at the 3′ end of the clone, suggesting that the cDNA clone encompasses most of the mRNA species observed in the Northern blot (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Northern hybridization.

Blomqvist A.G. Yee F. Jazin E. Yoo H. Wahlestedt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10935-10937Google Scholar) reveals significant differences. Overall, the two receptors are 31% identical at the amino acid level. Their sequences show the greatest similarity in the first intracellular loop and the second and sixth transmembrane regions, being 63%, 61%, and 50% identical, respectively. On the nucleotide level, the coding regions of the two NPY receptors were 47% identical. This relatively low homology to the Y1 receptor may explain why cloning with Y1 probes has not been fruitful. A search of the GenBank™ data base revealed that the Y2 nucleic acid sequence showed some similarity to the NK-2R neurokinin A receptor and two putative opioid receptors(20Gerard N.P. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows Jr., T.B. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20455-20462Google Scholar, 21Goldstein A. Xie G.-X. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4124-4128Google Scholar, 22Mansson E. Bare L.A. Yang D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1431-1437Google Scholar). The Y2 receptor is believed to be a common presynaptic receptor (2Colmers W.F. Wahlestedt C. The Biology of Neuropeptide Y and Related Peptides. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Google Scholar) and to be the predominant NPY receptor in the brain(23Dumont Y. Fournier A. Pierre St., S. Quirion R. J. Neuroscience. 1993; 13: 73-86Google Scholar). To study the distribution of the mRNA corresponding to the Y2 receptor encoded by pNPYR-398, Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA from several parts of the brain were hybridized with a 1.9-kb fragment of the Y2 cDNA that contained the entire receptor open reading frame. A single 4-kb mRNA transcript was detected in the amygdala, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and subthalamic nucleus (Fig. 3A), cortex, medulla, occipital pole, and frontal lobe (Fig. 3B). No hybridization was detected in RNA from peripheral tissues (data not shown). This suggests that either another form of the Y2 receptor is found in the periphery or that the Y2 mRNA transcript is present at levels undetectable by Northern analysis. In situ hybridization studies are in progress to address this question. Southern blot analysis to human genomic DNA (Fig. 4) suggests that there is a single Y2 receptor gene. Since the Y2 receptor is known to be expressed in the periphery (1Hazlewood R.L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 202: 44-63Google Scholar) these data support the hypothesis that either there is another form of the Y2 receptor in the periphery that is very different from the described here or the Y2 mRNA is present at very low levels. The truncated fragment of the pNPYR-398 clone containing the Y2 open reading frame described above was subcloned into pcDNA3 and transfected into CHO cells for stable expression. Competition binding experiments demonstrated a pharmacology identical to that seen in the COS-7 cells (Table 1). In neuroblastoma cells, the Y2 receptor appears to couple to multiple second messenger systems including the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and calcium mobilization(24Lynch J.W. Lemos V.S. Bucher B. Stoclet J.-C. Takeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8226-8233Google Scholar, 25Shigeri Y. Fujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8842-8848Google Scholar). To examine the functional coupling of the recombinant Y2 receptor to second messenger systems, the effect of NPY, [Leu31,Pro34]NPY, and NPY13-36 on cAMP and calcium mobilization was studied in the CHO-hY2 cells. Activation with 100 nM NPY, [Leu31,Pro34]NPY, and NPY13-36 inhibited forskolin (10 μM) stimulated cAMP accumulation by 72%, 7%, and 71%, respectively (Fig. 5A). When the cells were pretreated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml), the peptides did not inhibit the accumulation of forskolin-stimulated cAMP, suggesting that the Y2 receptor couples to Gαi. In addition, NPY did not inhibit the accumulation of forskolin-stimulated cAMP in CHO cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector (data not shown). Activation of the CHO-hY2 cells with the NPY analogs NPY2-36 (1 μM) and NPY13-36 (1 μM) resulted in a 13-14-fold increase in intracellular calcium (Fig. 5B). Neither MCP-1 (5 μM) or galanin (5 μM) elicited a change in intracellular calcium levels. Although calcium mobilization is frequently associated with G-protein-coupled receptors linked to phospholipase C(26Sternweis P.C. Smrcka A.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 502-506Google Scholar), this is not necessarily the case(27Wahlestedt C. Grundemar L. Hakanson R. Heilig M. Shen G.H. Zukowska-Grojec Z. Reis D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 611: 7-26Google Scholar). The specific G-protein mediating the increase of intracellular calcium described here is not known at this time. In summary, while NPY appears to be an important mediator of a wide variety of physiological functions, a clear understanding of how these functions are mediated has been hampered by the lack of cloned NPY receptors. The present cloning and pharmacological characterization of pNPYR-398 that encodes a human NPY Y2 receptor should facilitate the elucidation of the structure, function, regulation, and diversity of neuropeptide Y receptors as well as the identification of Y2 receptor-specific antagonists We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2153146045,"We have cloned a mouse cDNA that encodes p36, a novel subunit of the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). p36 contains a C3HC4 zinc-binding domain or RING factor and is associated both with a TFIIH-bound form of CAK and with a free trimeric form. p36 promotes the assembly of CDK7 and cyclin H in vitro, stabilizing the transient CDK7-cyclin H complex. Stabilization and activation of CAK by p36 is independent of the phosphorylation state of T170, the conserved activating residue of CDK7. Assembly of active CDK7-cyclin H dimers can also occur through an alternative p36-independent pathway that requires phosphorylation of T170 by a CAK-activating kinase, or CAKAK. Thus, CDK7-cyclin H complex formation can be achieved by multiple mechanisms."

This transcriptional activity can be attenuated by the addition of either of three different classes of estrogen receptor antagonists, indicating that these elements function as classical estrogen receptor-dependent enhancers.

Previously, most Alu sequences have been considered to be functionally inert.

https://openalex.org/W2158374311,"We have fluorescently labeled one of the eight genomic segments of influenza virus RNA and a recombinant influenza viral protein, the nucleoprotein (NP), to investigate the requirement for their uptake into nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells. We found that the influenza viral NP behaves like a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) containing protein. Thus, at 0°C it docks at the nuclear envelope only in the presence of the heterodimeric karyopherin (either karyopherin α1β or karyopherin α2β), and docking is competitively inhibited by an unlabeled NLS containing substrate. Like other NLS-containing proteins, at 20°C NP is imported into the nucleus after further addition of the GTPase Ran and of p10. In contrast, the fluorescently labeled, 890-nucleotide-long viral RNA segment does not dock to the nuclear envelope or enter the nucleus either in the presence of exogenous cytosol or of karyopherin heterodimer, Ran, and p10. However, in the presence of NP the RNA is able to dock and enter the nucleus with transport requirements indistinguishable from those for docking and entry of NP. These data indicate that uptake of the influenza virus RNA segment is not via a signal in the RNA but via an NLS of a viral protein such as NP.

The mechanism of entry of ribonucleoproteins into the nucleus is not known. Microinjection studies have suggested that import of some of the U small nuclear RNAs occurs by two biochemically distinct pathways that do not compete with the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) 1The abbreviations used are: NLSnuclear localization sequenceNPnucleoprotein of influenza virusNPCnuclear pore complexRNPribonucleoproteinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateBRLBufallo rat livervRNAviral RNAHSAhuman serum albumin. -mediated route for nuclear import of proteins(1Michaud N.

However, all three pathways use the nuclear pore complex (NPC) as antibodies to some nucleoporins (a collective term for NPC proteins) or wheat germ agglutinin (some nucleoporins contain N-acetylglucosamine residues) block import of proteins as well as of RNPs (1Michaud N.

Cell. 1981; 26: 391-400Google Scholar). The entry of isolated influenza viral RNPs into the nucleus has been explored by microinjection and also been shown to proceed via the NPC(5Martin K. Helenius A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 232-244Google Scholar, 6Kemler I. Whittaker G. Helenius A. Virology. 1994; 202: 1028-1033Google Scholar). However, it is not known by which pathway the viral RNP enters. The influenza virus particle contains eight different negative strand RNAs varying in length from approximately 900 to 2,500 nucleotides(7Palese P. Cell. 1977; 10: 1-10Google Scholar). Each of the RNA molecules is coated by multiple copies of viral nucleoprotein (NP) at one NP per 20 nucleotides(8Compans R.W. Content J. Duesberg P.H. J. Virol. 1972; 10: 795-800Google Scholar). A heterotrimeric RNA polymerase complex is located at one end of each of the viral RNAs (9Murti K.G. Webster R.G. Jones I.M. Virology. 1988; 164: 562-566Google Scholar). The viral matrix protein, M1, forms an inner shell around the RNPs and is bounded by a membrane containing the integral membrane proteins M2, hemagglutinin, and neuraminidase(10Rees P.J. Dimmock N.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1981; 53: 125-132Google Scholar, 11Ruigrok R.W.H. Calder L.J. Wharton S.A. Virology. 1989; 173: 311-316Google Scholar). Virus entry into the cell is via hemagglutinin-mediated membrane fusion in a late endosomal compartment(12Stegmann T. Dames R.W. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys.

The M2 functions as an acid-activated channel for monovalent cations (14Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 1-20Google Scholar, 15Sugrue R.S. Hay A.S. J. Virol. 1991; 180: 617-624Google Scholar) and appears to be required to divest the multimeric RNP complex of its M1, yielding individual viral RNPs. It is these RNPs that enter the nucleus both after infection (5Martin K. Helenius A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 232-244Google Scholar) and after microinjection(6Kemler I. Whittaker G. Helenius A. Virology. 1994; 202: 1028-1033Google Scholar). Nuclear uptake is an ATP- and temperature-sensitive process(5Martin K. Helenius A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 232-244Google Scholar, 6Kemler I. Whittaker G. Helenius A. Virology. 1994; 202: 1028-1033Google Scholar). As each of the four viral RNA-associated proteins in the microinjected RNPs has been reported to contain an NLS(16Jones I.M. Reay P.A. Philpott K.L. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2371-2376Google Scholar, 17Davey J. Dimmock N.J. Colman A. Cell. 1985; 40: 667-675Google Scholar, 18Nieto A. DeLaLuna S. Barcena J. Portela A. Ortin J. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 29-36Google Scholar), nuclear import might proceed via an NLS-mediated pathway. Consistent with this idea is the finding that in a yeast two-hybrid system, NP interacted with two proteins, termed NPI-1 (19O'Neill R.E. Palese P. Virology. 1994; 206: 116-125Google Scholar) and NPI-3. 2R. E. O'Neill and P. Palese, unpublished results. These two proteins were subsequently shown to be the transport factors karyopherin α1 and karyopherin α2, respectively, that have been demonstrated to bind to NLS-containing proteins(20Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2008-2011Google Scholar, 21Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6532-6536Google Scholar). Using digitonin-permeabilized mammalian cells and an NLS-containing protein, a number of transport factors required for import into nuclei have been isolated from cytosol. A heterodimeric protein complex, termed karyopherin(22Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To address the question of whether influenza viral RNA can enter the nucleus by itself or whether its entry is mediated by an associated NLS-containing protein, such as NP, we prepared unlabeled or fluorescently labeled components, either RNA (NS segment of influenza A/WSN/33 virus) or NP. These components were then incubated with digitonin-permeabilized cells in reactions assaying docking to the nuclear envelope and uptake into the nucleus using all recombinant transport factors. We found that NP by itself could be docked and imported into the nucleus in the presence of transport factors but that RNA by itself could not. However, RNA could be docked and imported in the presence of NP, demonstrating that viral RNA import into nuclei is by an NLS-mediated pathway. Bufallo rat liver (BRL) cells were grown on coverslips and were extracted with digitonin (50 μg/ml for 5 min at room temperature) as described previously(20Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl.

Docking of various fluorescently labeled substrates to the nuclear envelope of the digitonin-permeabilized cells was assayed by incubation at 0°C in the presence of components indicated in the legends to Figure 1:, Figure 2: and was monitored by fluorescence microscopy(32Moore M.S.

The NP of influenza A/PR/8/34 virus was subcloned between the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pET28a(+) (Novagen, Inc.) for expression of a His 6-tagged recombinant protein. Bacterially expressed NP (containing 37 additional N-terminal residues and 6 N-terminal His) was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeling of NP (260 μg/ml) was performed at room temperature in 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 9.0, 50 mM NaCl, and 100 μg/ml FITC.

Run-off transcription using T7 RNA polymerase generates an 890-nucleotide-long negative-sense vRNA of the NS segment of influenza A/WSN/33 virus and a 790-nucleotide-long truncated NPI-3 transcript. 100-μl transcription reactions contained 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM spermidine, 10 mM NaCl, 400 μM each of GTP, CTP, and UTP, 200 μM ATP, 200 μM N6-(aminohexyl)ATP (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units of RNasin (Promega), 5 μg of plasmid DNA, and 4 μl of TNT T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Transcription reactions were incubated for 90 min at 37°C. Template DNA was removed with RNase-free DNase I (Promega). RNA was purified by extraction with phenol:chloroform (1:10) twice, extraction with chloroform, and chromatography over a Sepharose G-50 column. Derivatization of RNA (150 μg/ml) was carried out in 0.2 M NaHCO3, pH 8.2, with 2 mg/ml tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate for 2 h at room temperature. Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-RNA was purified by chromatography over Sepharose G-50, extraction with phenol, and ethanol precipitation. It was reported that influenza virus NP could enter into and accumulate in nuclei after microinjection into oocytes of NP itself or of the corresponding mRNA or cDNA(17Davey J. Dimmock N.J. Colman A. Cell. 1985; 40: 667-675Google Scholar). The sequence of NP that functions as an NLS to allow entry into the nucleus has not yet been mapped although a region encoding amino acids 327-345 has been reported to function in nuclear retention(17Davey J. Dimmock N.J. Colman A. Cell. 1985; 40: 667-675Google Scholar). To determine whether NP behaves like an NLS-containing substrate and is transported into nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells in a transport factor-dependent fashion, we prepared recombinant fluorescently labeled NP (NP∗). As previously reported for a model import substrate (NLS conjugated to human serum albumin (NLS-HSA)) there was docking of NP∗ to the nuclear envelope only in the presence of karyopherin α1 and β (Fig. 1b) or karyopherin α2 and β (Fig. 1c). Neither buffer alone (Fig. 1a) nor karyopherin α alone (not shown) nor karyopherin β alone (not shown) yielded docking. Docking could be competitively inhibited by NLS-HSA (not shown), indicating that recombinant NP∗ contains a functional NLS that can be recognized and docked by either karyopherin heterodimer, α1β or α2β. Moreover, as previously reported for NLS-HSA(20Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2008-2011Google Scholar, 21Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6532-6536Google Scholar), NP∗ can be imported into the nucleus in the presence of either one of the two karyopherin heterodimers and of Ran and p10 (Fig. 1, e and f). We fluorescently labeled an 890-nucleotide negative-sense RNA of the NS segment of influenza virus (see “Experimental Procedures”) and incubated the labeled viral RNA (vRNA∗) with digitonin-permeabilized cells in the presence of Xenopus cytosol or of Xenopus cytosol fraction A (32Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Google Scholar) (not shown) or of karyopherin α1 and β (Fig. 2a) or karyopherin α2 and β (Fig. 2c). Neither of these incubations yielded docking of the vRNA∗ at the nuclear envelope. However, when NP (not fluorescently labeled) was included in the docking reaction there was docking of the vRNA∗ at the nuclear envelope with either karyopherin α1β (Fig. 2b) or karyopherin α2β (Fig. 2d) and no docking when either α1 and α2 or β were omitted (not shown). These results indicated that viral RNA by itself was unable to dock at the nuclear envelope and that docking occurred only in the presence of NP in an NLS- and karyopherin-mediated fashion. Likewise, there was no import of the vRNA∗ alone in the presence of the karyopherin heterodimer, Ran and p10 (Fig. 3a). However, there was import when NP was present in the reaction (Fig. 3b). Import was competitively inhibited by NLS-HSA (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that import of vRNA∗ into nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells could be mediated by NP in an NLS-dependent pathway using all the transport factors that are required for import of an NLS-containing protein. We have also tested whether influenza virus NP can mediate nuclear import of non-viral RNA. A 790-nucleotide-long, fluorescently labeled NPI-3 RNA by itself was not transported into the nucleus, but it was when NP was included into the assay (data not shown). Thus, NP can also bind to a non-virus-derived RNA and mediate its transport into the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized cells in the presence of the karyopherin heterodimer, Ran and p10. We investigated the time course of import of NP∗ (Fig. 4A) or vRNA∗+ NP (Fig. 4B). In both cases import proceeded with similar kinetics with maximal import at about 20 min. The concentrations of vRNA (200 ng/assay) and NP (200 ng/assay) that were used in the experiments shown in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4: amounted to a molar ratio of 4.8 NP/vRNA, i.e. far below the molar ratio of 45 NP/vRNA if the vRNA were fully coated by NP(8Compans R.W. Content J. Duesberg P.H. J. Virol. 1972; 10: 795-800Google Scholar). To determine the effect of NP concentrations on the rate of vRNA∗ import, we varied the concentration of NP at a constant concentration of vRNA∗ (200 ng/assay). We found maximal import at NP concentrations of 100-200 ng/assay (Fig. 5), i.e. the import of vRNA∗ in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4: was indeed at maximal rates. However, we do not know the total amount of vRNA∗-NP that was imported nor what the actual molar NP/vRNA∗ ratio of the imported vRNA∗-NP was. Interestingly, at very high molar NP/vRNA∗ ratios there was inhibition of vRNA∗-NP import. For example at 10 μg of NP and 200 ng of vRNA∗/assay amounting to an NP/vRNA∗ ratio of 240 the rate of import of vRNA∗-NP dropped to 70% of maximum (data not shown), probably as a result of competition between NP and vRNA∗-NP. Our data here suggest that influenza virus RNA does not contain its own (“cis-acting”) signal for nuclear import but that import is via RNA-associated protein(s) containing an NLS and therefore requires all the transport factors (karyopherin, Ran, and p10) obligatory for uptake of NLS-containing proteins into nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells. There are potentially four such NLS-containing proteins associated with the genomic viral RNA: the heterotrimeric RNA polymerase complex and the NP (see the Introduction). It is therefore conceivable that the heterotrimeric RNA polymerase complex might mediate entry of the influenza virus RNA as well. Unlike specific viral RNA binding proteins (35Blumberg B.M. Giorgi C. Kolakofsky D. Cell. 1983; 32: 559-567Google Scholar, 36Moyer S.A. Smallwood-Kentro S. Haddad A. Prevec L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2170-2178Google Scholar, 37Weiss B. Nitschko H. Ghattas I. Wright R. Schlesinger S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5310-5318Google Scholar) NP can bind to any RNA provided that it is longer than 15 nucleotides(38Yamanaka K. Ishihama A. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11151-11155Google Scholar). NP binding is to the sugar phosphate backbone leaving the bases exposed and melting the secondary structure of the RNA(39Baudin F. Bach C. Cusack S. Ruigrok R.W.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3158-3165Google Scholar). These binding properties explain NP's ability to mediate import into the nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells even of a non-viral RNA. Whether these promiscuous binding properties of NP could affect synthesis, transport, function, and metabolism of endogenous RNAs of virally infected cells is not known. It should be kept in mind, however, that there are numerous cellular RNA-binding proteins with which NP would have to compete in the infected cell. The binding site of NP for RNA has been mapped to amino acid residues 91-188(40Kobayashi M. Toyoda T. Adyshev D.M. Azuma Y. Ishihama A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8433-8436Google Scholar). The recombinant NP that we tested here contained an additional 37 N-terminal residues and a C-terminal His tag. Neither of these two NP modifications seemed to interfere with nuclear import of NP∗ or with the association of NP with RNA as RNA∗ could be imported in an NP-dependent fashion. It remains to be seen whether nuclear entry of nucleic acids via specifically or nonspecifically associated proteins and an NLS pathway is unique to genomic influenza viral RNAs or whether it is common to other viral or cellular nucleic acids. DNA viruses such as herpesvirus or adenovirus have been reported to dock at the NPC and are thought to inject their DNA across the NPC into the nucleus(41Tognon M. Furlong D. Conley A.J. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1981; 40: 870-880Google Scholar, 42Batterson W. Furlong D. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1983; 45: 397-407Google Scholar, 43Dales S. Chardonet Y. Virology. 1973; 56: 465-483Google Scholar). Based on our studies it is more likely that associated, NLS-containing proteins mediate nuclear entry of the viral genomes of the DNA viruses as well. Lentiviruses, of which HIV-1 is a member, are unique among retroviruses in that they can infect non-dividing cells. The HIV-1 matrix protein contains an NLS that is required for this function(44Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S. Dempsey M.P. Sharova N. Adzhubel A. Spitz L. Lewis P. Goldfarb D. Emerman M. Stevenson M. Nature. 1993; 365: 666-669Google Scholar, 45Gallay P. Swingler S. Aiken C. Trono D. Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Google Scholar). It is likely that the matrix protein functions in importing the HIV-1 preintegration complex into the nucleus. We are greatly indebted to Aurelian Radu for the generous gift of karyopherin β, to Philip Bernstein for recombinant human Ran, and to Makoto Hijikata for recombinant p10."

We have investigated whether a NOS heme-NO complex forms during aerobic steady-state catalysis. Visible and resonance Raman spectra recorded during steady-state NO synthesis by NOS showed that the majority of enzyme (70-90%) was present as its ferrous-nitrosyl complex. Ferrous-nitrosyl NOS formed only in the coincident presence of NADPH, L-arginine, and O2. Its level remained constant during NO synthesis until the NADPH was exhausted, after which the complex decayed to regenerate ferric resting NOS. Stopped-flow measurements revealed that the buildup of the ferrous-NO complex was rapid (<2 s) and caused a 10-fold decrease in the rate of NADPH consumption by NOS. Complex formation and decay could occur several times with no adverse affect on its subsequent formation or on NOS catalytic activity. Neither enzyme dilution nor NO scavengers (superoxide and oxyhemoglobin) diminished formation of ferrous-nitrosyl NOS or prevented the catalytic inhibition attributed to its formation. The ferrous-nitrosyl complex also formed in unfractionated cell cytosol containing neuronal NOS upon initiating NO synthesis. We conclude that a majority of neuronal NOS is converted quickly to a catalytically inactive ferrous-nitrosyl complex during NO synthesis independent of the external NO concentration. Thus, NO binding to the NOS heme may be a fundamental feature of catalysis and functions to down-regulate NO synthesis by neuronal NOS.

These enzymes are homodimers that catalyze the stepwise oxidation of L-arginine to NO plus L-citrulline(3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Google Scholar, 4Feldman P.F.

The flavins facilitate transfer of electrons from NADPH to the heme iron(8Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Google Scholar). In neuronal NOS, the flavin-to-heme electron transfer is triggered by calmodulin (CaM) binding(9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Google Scholar, 10Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

The NOS heme iron plays a central role by binding and activating O2 at the catalytic site. This ultimately leads to oxygen incorporation into both products of the enzyme reaction(4Feldman P.F. Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Eng. News. 1993; 71: 26-38Google Scholar, 7Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Google Scholar). Indeed, NO synthesis from either L-arginine or Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine is inhibited by CO, and spectral evidence demonstrates that CO inhibits the reaction by coordinating to the heme iron(11White K.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6627-6631Google Scholar, 12Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Google Scholar, 13McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H.

In addition to binding O2 or CO, the heme iron of neuronal NOS can bind NO as a sixth ligand in both the ferrous and ferric states under an anaerobic atmosphere to generate stable NOS heme iron-NO complexes (15Wang J.

The heme iron is axially coordinated to the protein via a cysteine thiolate, as is the case for cytochrome P450s, and is predominantly five-coordinate and high spin in ferric NOS. Substrate appears to bind directly above the heme group and can interact with ligands bound to the heme iron, such as NO or CO(14Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol.

During catalysis of NO synthesis, such positioning may sterically specify substrate hydroxylation events that are catalyzed by the heme iron.The binding of NO to neuronal NOS is particularly important in view of reports that NO can inhibit NOS activity(16Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 242-249Google Scholar, 17Buga G.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.F. Ignarro L.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 808-812Google Scholar, 18Griscavage J.M.

Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 124-128Google Scholar). Studies with neuronal NOS purified from rat cerebellum indicated that NO inhibits by interacting directly with enzyme rather than with any of the soluble cofactors or substrates(19Griscavage J.M. Fukuto J.M. Komori Y. Ignarro L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21644-21649Google Scholar). These studies also showed that NO generated by NOS caused an inhibition of catalysis(16Rogers N.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21644-21649Google Scholar), suggesting that NO may act as a negative feedback modulator of NOS, possibly through its interaction with enzyme-bound heme. This view was recently substantiated by optical absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopic evidence that showed neuronal NOS ends up as its ferrous heme-NO complex following NO synthesis under oxygen-limited conditions(15Wang J. Rousseau D.I. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Google Scholar). However, these studies did not address whether NO binds to neuronal NOS during normal aerobic catalysis and whether such a reaction explains the catalytic inhibition attributed to NO.Thus, our current objective was to determine whether L-arginine-derived NO would complex with the heme iron of neuronal NOS during enzyme catalysis under aerobic, steady-state conditions. Experiments were also conducted to determine if formation of a heme iron-NO complex was related to inhibition of NO synthesis, including stopped-flow analysis to examine the kinetic relationship between nitrosyl complex formation and inhibition of neuronal NOS by NO. Our results indicate that NO binding to the heme iron is rapid, quantitatively significant, and an integral part of the enzyme's normal catalytic processing and functions to regulate NO synthesis by neuronal NOS.

However, these studies did not address whether NO binds to neuronal NOS during normal aerobic catalysis and whether such a reaction explains the catalytic inhibition attributed to NO.Thus, our current objective was to determine whether L-arginine-derived NO would complex with the heme iron of neuronal NOS during enzyme catalysis under aerobic, steady-state conditions. Experiments were also conducted to determine if formation of a heme iron-NO complex was related to inhibition of NO synthesis, including stopped-flow analysis to examine the kinetic relationship between nitrosyl complex formation and inhibition of neuronal NOS by NO. Our results indicate that NO binding to the heme iron is rapid, quantitatively significant, and an integral part of the enzyme's normal catalytic processing and functions to regulate NO synthesis by neuronal NOS.

Toxicol. 1990; 30: 535-560Google Scholar). NO is synthesized by a family of enzymes termed NO synthases (NOSs). These enzymes are homodimers that catalyze the stepwise oxidation of L-arginine to NO plus L-citrulline(3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Google Scholar, 4Feldman P.F.

Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Google Scholar). The NOSs contain FAD, FMN, H4biopterin, and iron protoporphyrin IX (heme) prosthetic groups. The flavins facilitate transfer of electrons from NADPH to the heme iron(8Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Google Scholar). In neuronal NOS, the flavin-to-heme electron transfer is triggered by calmodulin (CaM) binding(9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Google Scholar, 10Matsuoka A. Stuehr D.J. Olson J.S. Clark P. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20335-20339Google Scholar), which occurs in response to elevated Ca2+ concentration(3Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Google Scholar). The NOS heme iron plays a central role by binding and activating O2 at the catalytic site. This ultimately leads to oxygen incorporation into both products of the enzyme reaction(4Feldman P.F. Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Eng. News. 1993; 71: 26-38Google Scholar, 7Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Google Scholar). Indeed, NO synthesis from either L-arginine or Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine is inhibited by CO, and spectral evidence demonstrates that CO inhibits the reaction by coordinating to the heme iron(11White K.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6627-6631Google Scholar, 12Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Google Scholar, 13McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H.

In addition to binding O2 or CO, the heme iron of neuronal NOS can bind NO as a sixth ligand in both the ferrous and ferric states under an anaerobic atmosphere to generate stable NOS heme iron-NO complexes (15Wang J.

Characterization of the heme iron in neuronal NOS has recently been accomplished by employing techniques such as optical absorption (9Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The heme iron is axially coordinated to the protein via a cysteine thiolate, as is the case for cytochrome P450s, and is predominantly five-coordinate and high spin in ferric NOS. Substrate appears to bind directly above the heme group and can interact with ligands bound to the heme iron, such as NO or CO(14Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22255-22258Google Scholar, 15Wang J. Rousseau D.I. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Google Scholar). During catalysis of NO synthesis, such positioning may sterically specify substrate hydroxylation events that are catalyzed by the heme iron. The binding of NO to neuronal NOS is particularly important in view of reports that NO can inhibit NOS activity(16Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 242-249Google Scholar, 17Buga G.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.F. Ignarro L.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 808-812Google Scholar, 18Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Sherman M.P. Ignarro I.J. J.

Studies with neuronal NOS purified from rat cerebellum indicated that NO inhibits by interacting directly with enzyme rather than with any of the soluble cofactors or substrates(19Griscavage J.M. Fukuto J.M. Komori Y. Ignarro L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21644-21649Google Scholar). These studies also showed that NO generated by NOS caused an inhibition of catalysis(16Rogers N.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 242-249Google Scholar, 19Griscavage J.M. Fukuto J.M. Komori Y. Ignarro L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21644-21649Google Scholar), suggesting that NO may act as a negative feedback modulator of NOS, possibly through its interaction with enzyme-bound heme. This view was recently substantiated by optical absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopic evidence that showed neuronal NOS ends up as its ferrous heme-NO complex following NO synthesis under oxygen-limited conditions(15Wang J. Rousseau D.I. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Google Scholar).

Both in situ hybridization experiments using lin-44 transcripts and experiments using reporter constructs designed to mimic patterns of lin-44 expression indicate that lin-44 is expressed in hypodermal cells at the tip of the tail and posterior to the cells with polarities affected by lin-44 mutations. Our mosaic analysis indicates that lin-44 acts cell nonautonomously.

The activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, and malate synthase are all higher relative to those in worms that are wild type for these genes, but acid phosphatase is down-regulated and alkaline phosphatase activity is lowered to 10% of the activity measured in age-1(+) and daf-2(+) worms.

https://openalex.org/W2022007049,"We have studied the kinetics of transcription through a nucleosome core. RNA polymerase transcribes the first approximately 25 bp of nucleosomal DNA rapidly, but then hits a barrier and continues slowly to the nucleosomal dyad region. Here, the barrier disappears and the transcript is completed at a rapid rate, as if on free DNA, indicating that histone octamer transfer is completed as polymerase reaches the dyad. If DNA behind the polymerase is removed during transcription, the barrier does not appear until the polymerase has penetrated up to 15 bp farther into the nucleosome. On a longer template, the barrier is almost eliminated. We have shown previously that the octamer is transferred around the transcribing polymerase via an intermediate containing an intranucleosomal DNA loop. Our results exclude the possibility that polymerase has difficulty breaking histone-DNA contacts and suggest instead that polymerase pauses because it has difficulty transcribing DNA in the loop."

PSA expression is developmentally regulated, presumably through mechanisms involving regulated expression of sialyltransferases involved in PSA biosynthesis. Several different sialyltransferase sequences have been implicated in PSA expression, although the precise roles of these enzymes in this context remain unclear.

While a murine STX fusion protein can catalyze the synthesis of a single α(2,8)-sialic acid linkage in vitro, the ability of STX to participate in PSA expression in vivo has not been demonstrated. We show here that STX transcripts are present in a PSA-positive, N-CAM-positive human small cell carcinoma line (NCI-H69/F3), but are absent in a variant of this line (NCI-H69/E2) selected to be PSA-negative and N-CAM-positive. To functionally confirm this correlation, we have cloned a human cDNA encoding the human STX sequence, and show, by transfection studies, that human STX can restore PSA expression when expressed in the PSA-negative, N-CAM-positive small cell carcinoma variant. We furthermore show that STX can confer PSA expression when expressed in a PSA-negative, N-CAM-positive murine cell line (NIH-3T3 cells), or when expressed in PSA-negative, N-CAM-negative COS-7 cells.

INTRODUCTIONSialyltransferases represent a family of terminal glycosyltransferases that catalyze the attachment of sialic acid to carbohydrates of many glycoproteins and glycolipids(1Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Google Scholar). Sialic acids are key determinants of carbohydrate structures involved in a variety of biological processes and are widely distributed on many cell types (2Paulson J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 272-276Google Scholar, 3Brandley B.K. Swiedler S.J. Robbins P.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 861-863Google Scholar, 4Varki A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 257-266Google Scholar). Homopolymers of sialic acids in α(2,8) linkage (polysialic acid, PSA, 1The abbreviations used are: PSApolysialic acidbpbase pair(s)SCLCsmall cell lung carcinomaN-CAMneural cell adhesion moleculeRACErapid amplification of cDNA endskbkilobase(s)mAbmonoclonal antibody. also abbreviated as polySia) have a more restricted spatio-temporal tissue distribution pattern than the more commonly found α(2,6)- and α(2,3)-linked sialic acid residues. For example, PSA is expressed by neuronal tissues, in the heart and the developing kidney, and in association with malignant transformation, such as in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC)(5Vimr E.R. McCoy R.D. Vollger H.F. Wilkison N.C. Troy F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1971-1975Google Scholar, 6Roth J. Taatjes D.J. Bitter-Suermann D. Finne J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar). Furthermore, PSA has been reported to be associated with only two proteins, the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and sodium channel α subunits(9Nybroe O. Linnemann D. Bock E. Neurochem. Int. 1988; 12: 251-262Google Scholar, 10Zuber C. Lackie P.M. Caterall W.A. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9965-9971Google Scholar). Changes in the amount of PSA on N-CAM modulates the adhesive properties of N-CAM, and also affects the cell surface properties of other molecules like some integrins, N-cadherin, and G4/NgCAM(11Acheson A. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 479-486Google Scholar, 12Acheson A. Sunshine L.J. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 143-153Google Scholar, 13Rutishauser U. Acheson A. Hall A.K.

These effects are presumed to be due to the unusual physicochemical properties of this very large, abundant, negatively charged, and linear cell surface polyglycan(14Yang P.F. Yin X.H. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1487-1496Google Scholar).A requirement for N-CAM as an acceptor molecule in PSA synthesis is implied from several studies(15Breen K.C. Regan C.M. Development. 1985; 104: 147-154Google Scholar, 16McCoy R.D. Vimr E.R. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12695-12699Google Scholar), although this has not been demonstrated directly. Other studies suggest that PSA biosynthesis involves the concerted activity of two or more specific sialyltransferases(16McCoy R.D. Vimr E.R. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12695-12699Google Scholar, 17Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10330-10340Google Scholar). This includes a requirement for one or more α(2,3)-sialyltransferases to create α(2,3)-linked sialic acid moieties, that in turn are the presumed acceptor substrate for subsequent addition of α(2,8)-linked sialic acid moieties(18Livingston B.D. De Robertis E.M. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1990; 1: 39-44Google Scholar, 19Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11966-11970Google Scholar). It is possible that PSA synthesis then proceeds through a two-step process involving the addition of a single α(2,8)-linked sialic acid residue to the α(2,3)-linked sialic acid by one distinct α(2,8)-sialyltransferase (an “initiase” reaction), followed by the addition of multiple α(2,8)-linked sialic acid residues that yield PSA by a second distinct α(2,8)-sialyltransferase (a “polymerase” reaction). This possibility is supported by in vitro experiments indicating that at least three different α(2,8)-sialyltransferases (ST8SiaI, GD3 synthase, (20Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Ohta S.

Hamamoto T. Tsjui S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar)) can catalyze the attachment of a single α(2,8)-linked sialic acid residue to terminal α(2,3)-sialic acid linkages.Alternatively, a single α(2,8)-sialyltransferase may operate to directly catalyze PSA synthesis on a glycoconjugate template containing a terminal α(2,3)-linked sialic acid. This notion is supported by the recent demonstration that expression of a single α(2,8)-sialyltransferase gene, termed PST-1(25Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopmann J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar), or PST(26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Google Scholar), is sufficient for the expression of PSA in N-CAM-positive, PSA-negative mammalian cell lines (CHO-2A10, NIH-3T3, and COS-hN-6, a COS cell line expressing with human N-CAM-140 cDNA, (25Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopmann J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar); COS-1 cells and HeLa cells transfected with an N-CAM expression vector, (26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Google Scholar)). In principle, both such modes of PSA synthesis may exist, although this remains to be confirmed, since it has not yet been possible to recreate polymerization of α(2,8)-linked sialic acids in vitro.The STX gene represents a member of the sialyltransferase gene family whose developmentally regulated expression patterns correlate well with PSA expression in certain tissues(1Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Google Scholar, 24Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsjui S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar, 27Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Google Scholar). A role for this sequence in PSA expression remained circumstantial, however, since initial efforts failed to demonstrate an enzymatic activity associated with the (rat) STX polypeptide(27Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Google Scholar). Subsequent efforts have demonstrated that a recombinant (mouse) STX-protein A fusion protein can catalyze the synthesis of a single α(2,8)-sialic acid linkage in vitro(23Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a definitive demonstration that STX participates in PSA expression, in vitro or in vivo, has not been accomplished.We show here that STX expression correlates with PSA expression in a PSA-positive human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell line (NCI-H69/F3)(8Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar), whereas STX transcripts are absent from a variant of this line selected to be PSA-negative (NCI-H69/E2)(8Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar). Transfection of the PSA-negative variant SCLC line with an STX expression vector restores PSA expression in that line, and in other PSA-negative cell lines. The observations imply that transcriptional regulation of STX can regulate PSA expression, suggest that STX shares overlapping enzymatic activity with PST-1/PST, and imply that determination of PSA expression by STX can be independent of N-CAM expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell LinesTwo N-CAM-positive clonal SCLC sublines differing in PSA expression (NCI-H69/F3 and NCI-H69/E2) have been described(8Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 and COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum with penicillin-streptomycin.Molecular Cloning of a Full-length Human STX cDNAA cDNA library was constructed using the mammalian expression vector pCDM8 (Invitrogen) and poly(A)+ RNA from the PSA-positive cell line (NCI-H69/F3), according to (28Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Google Scholar). A 580-bp fragment corresponding to bp 69-649 of a human STX cDNA (1Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Google Scholar) was generated with the PCR, using PCR primers derived from the partial STX cDNA (1Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Google Scholar) (5′ primer, GCCCACAGCTTCGTCATCAGGTG; 3′ primer, GGCCGACAGTCAGTTTCAAAGCCC), the NCI-H69/F3 cell cDNA library as a template, and standard PCR conditions (Taq polymerase; 95°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s and 72°C for 90 s; 35 cycles). The resulting 580-bp PCR product was subcloned into pCR™ II (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The 580-bp insert was used to screen (29Sambrook J. Fritsch D.D. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) a human fetal heart λgt11 cDNA library (Clontech). The inserts from two positive clones (3.5 and 2.5 kb) were subcloned into pCDNAI (Invitrogen), and sequenced. Both clones were deficient in the 5′ end of the coding region. The 5′ RACE procedure (30Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Google Scholar) was used to obtain the 5′ end of the open reading frame, using conditions suggested by the RACE reagent manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.), except that the reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out at 50°C. RACE reactions used poly(A)+ RNA from NCI-H69/F3 cells, two gene-specific primers (5′-TGGTGATGAGGAGCCGTTTATTACAACTTC; 5′-CACAGCTGATCTGATTGTACCTCTGCCTCC), and the PCR (two sequential rounds of 35 cycles each, involving incubations at 95°C for 30 s, 70°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s). A 150-bp 5′ RACE product was subcloned; its sequence was consistent with that predicted for the 5′ end of the human STX cDNA. This fragment was appended to the 5′ end of the 2.5-kb cDNA described above at a shared EcoRI site, to form a cDNA encompassing a single long open reading frame predicted to encode the entire STX polypeptide. The resulting fragment was subcloned in the “sense” orientation between the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCDNAI, to create the vector pSTXFL.Northern Blot AnalysisNorthern blots were prepared as described(29Sambrook J. Fritsch D.D. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from SCLC lines, or from a 17-day mouse embryo. Blots containing mRNA from multiple human tissues were obtained from Clontech. Blots were probed in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 1 × PE, at 42°C, using 32P-labeled (29Sambrook J. Fritsch D.D. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) DNA fragments. Probes included bp 69-649 of the human STX cDNA(1Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Google Scholar), bp 404-875 of the human GD3 synthase cDNA(20Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Ohta S. Hanai N. Tsjui S. Nishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 22: 15950-15956Google Scholar), or a 780-bp segment of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA(31Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Google Scholar). A PST-1 probe (25Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopmann J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar) was prepared using the PCR, cDNA prepared (29Sambrook J. Fritsch D.D. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) from Chinese hamster ovary cell RNA, and PCR primers corresponding to bp 79-108 (5′ primer) and to bp 358-331 (3′ primer) of the hamster PST-1 cDNA (25Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopmann J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar). A mST8Sia III probe was prepared using the PCR, a mouse brain cDNA library (Clontech), and PCR primers corresponding to bp 106-133 (5′ primer) and to bp 351-378 (3′ primer)(24Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsjui S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar). Blots were washed at 50°C in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min and were subjected to autoradiography.Transfection Procedures- All transient transfections were completed using a commercially available liposome-based transfection reagent (DOTAP, Boehringer Mannheim), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The SCLC cell line NCI-H69/E2 was co-transfected with pRSVlarge T(32de Chasseval R. de Villartay J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 20: 245-250Google Scholar), a pBR322-based vector that encodes the SV40 large T antigen, to facilitate episomal replication of the co-transfected expression plasmids carrying the SV40 origin of replication. Transfection efficiencies were controlled for by co-transfecting with the vector pCDNAI-CAT (Invitrogen), and subsequently assaying extracts prepared form the transfected cells for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity(29Sambrook J. Fritsch D.D. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Immunohistochemical AnalysisTransfected cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry(33Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Google Scholar). Cells were stained and washed at 4°C in staining medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 2% fetal calf serum, 0.1 M HEPES, pH = 7.4). PSA expression was assessed with the mouse monoclonal anti-PSA antibody mAb 735 (used at 5 μg/ml)(34Frosch M. Goergen J. Bulnois G.J. Timmis K.M. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1194-1198Google Scholar), from Dr. D. Bitter-Suermann (Institute of Medical Microbiology, Mainz, Germany). Rabbit anti-human N-CAM antiserum was used at a saturating concentration (Dako). Cell-bound antibodies were detected with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRecent molecular cloning work demonstrates that a sialyltransferase sequence termed PST-1, or PST, (for polysialyltransferase) can yield cell surface PSA expression when expressed in PSA-negative cell lines(25Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopmann J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar, 26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Google Scholar). Although these data implicate PST-1/PST in PSA expression, an in vitro enzymatic correlate for these observations is not yet available. Among all known sialyltransferases, PST-1/PST is most similar to one termed STX (59% overall amino acid sequence identity; hamster PST-1 or human PST versus rat STX). STX is expressed primarily in the fetal and newborn brain, but not in the adult brain, and thus correlates with the temporal sequence of PSA expression in that tissue. These considerations suggest a role for STX in the developmental regulation of PSA expression in the central nervous system. However, efforts to assign an enzymatic activity to the rat STX sequence have not met with success(27Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Google Scholar). More recent work indicates that, in vitro, mouse STX can utilize radiolabeled CMP-sialic acid to incorporate radiolabeled sialic acid into sialylated, N-linked glycoproteins(23Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Google Scholar). Indirect evidence suggests that α(2,8)-sialic acid linkages were formed by STX in these experiments, although there is currently no direct evidence that STX participates in PSA biosynthesis or expression.Differential Expression of Human STX in SCLC Cell LinesWe have described an N-CAM-positive, PSA-positive small cell lung cancer cell line (NCI-H69/F3), and the isolation and characterization of clonal variants of this line that remain N-CAM-positive, but that are deficient in PSA expression(8Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar). One such PSA-negative line (NCI-H69/E2) and the PSA-positive control line NCI-H69/F3 were used to explore the role of PST-1 and STX in PSA expression(8Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analyses confirm that the NCI-H69/F3 line expresses N-CAM and PSA, whereas the variant line NCI-H69/E2 is deficient in cell surface PSA expression, yet remains positive for N-CAM expression (Fig. 1A). The major carrier of PSA in the NCI-H69/F3 line is N-CAM, as reported previously(8Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar).Northern blot analyses indicate that the PSA-positive line NCI-H69/F3 is deficient in transcripts corresponding to PST-1/PST (although PST-1 transcripts are observed in human heart; Fig. 2B), indicating that this gene does not participate in PSA expression in these cells. Likewise, this cell line is deficient in GD3 synthase and mST8Sia III transcripts (data not shown). However, these analyses demonstrate that the STX transcript is easily detectable in the PSA-positive line (Fig. 2A). The STX transcript in the PSA-positive SCLC line (Fig. 2A) is similar in size (~6.0 kb) to the human (5.7 kb, human heart; data not shown and (1Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Google Scholar)) and rat (5.5 kb, (27Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Google Scholar)) STX transcripts, and corresponds roughly to broad range (1.7-6.7 kb) of STX transcripts observed in the embryonic mouse(24Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsjui S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar). By contrast, STX transcripts are absent from the PSA-negative variant SCLC line (Fig. 2A). These observations suggest that PSA expression in this pair of cell lines is controlled by transcriptional regulation of the STX gene.Figure 2:Northern blot analysis of the PSA-positive and PSA-negative SCLC cell lines. A, Northern blot hybridized with a human STX probe. The Northern blot was prepared using poly(A)+ mRNA (2 μg/lane) isolated from the PSA-positive SCLC cell line (PSA+, NCI-H69/F3), from the PSA negative SCLC cell line (PSA-, NCI-H69/E2), and from a mouse embryo at embryonic day 17 (E17). The blot was probed with a segment of the human STX cDNA (“STX”), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, Northern blot hybridized with a hamster PST-1 probe. The blot shown in panel A was stripped of the STX probe (29Sambrook J. Fritsch D.D. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and hybridized with a segment of the hamster PST-1 gene (PST −1), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Human heart (Heart) poly(A)+ RNA served as a positive control(26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Google Scholar). C, Northern blot hybridized with a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (GAPDH). The blot shown in panels A and B was stripped of the STX probe (29Sambrook J. Fritsch D.D. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and was hybridized with a segment of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RNA molecular size standards are indicated on the left (in kilobases).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Primary Structure of a Human STX cDNAWe sought to confirm an essential role for STX in PSA expression in these cell lines by expressing the STX polypeptide in the PSA-negative line, and asking if this would convert the variant to a PSA-positive state. A human cDNA encompassing the entire coding region of the human STX polypeptide was therefore isolated and characterized (see “Experimental Procedures”). The pSTXFL clone maintains a continuous 375-amino acid open reading frame (Fig. 3) encompassing segments termed sialylmotifs, which are highly conserved among members of the mammalian sialyltransferase superfamily(27Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Google Scholar). The human STX protein maintains a 17-amino acid hydrophobic sequence near its NH2 terminus. This segment is flanked by charged residues, and thus corresponds to a “signal anchor” sequence predicting a type II transmembrane orientation characteristic of glycosyltransferases(35Paulson J.C. Colley K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Google Scholar). Human STX differs from the rat enzyme at 8 positions (rat residues Ala-68, Leu-75, Ser-78, Gln-155, Thr-188, Gly-232, Ala-257, and Asn-308), for an overall 98% amino acid sequence identity between the rat and human enzymes(1Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Google Scholar). Similarity to the mouse STX sequence cannot be determined since its DNA and derived protein sequence are not available(23Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Google Scholar). Human STX shares an overall amino acid sequence identity of 59% with hamster PST-1/human PST(25Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopmann J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar, 26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Google Scholar), 31% with human GD3 synthase(20Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Ohta S. Hanai N. Tsjui S. Nishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 22: 15950-15956Google Scholar), and 36% with mouse ST8Sia III(24Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsjui S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar), three other mammalian sialyltransferases implicated in the synthesis of α(2,8)-linked sialic acid linkages. There are local regions of sequence identity among these enzymes that are substantially higher than these values, including the region encompassing the L and S sialylmotifs (Fig. 3) (data not shown).Figure 3:Human STX cDNA and predicted amino acid sequences. The DNA sequence of the coding region of the human STX is shown above the predicted amino acid sequence. The predicted signal anchor sequence is doubly underlined and italicized. Potential asparagine-linked oligosaccharide attachment sites are underlined. Amino acids underlined with a dotted line correspond to consensus sequences identified previously for mammalian sialyltransferases (the “L” and “S” sialylmotifs; Refs. 1 and 20).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Expression of PSA in Cell Lines Transiently Transfected with the Human STX cDNATo determine if human STX can restore PSA expression to the PSA-negative, STX-negative SCLC variant, the human STX cDNA was installed in a mammalian expression vector and was introduced into these cells by transfection (see “Experimental Procedures”). A substantial fraction (~30%) of the STX-transfected variant cells stain brightly (Fig. 1B) with the monoclonal antibody (mAb 735) specific for PSA(34Frosch M. Goergen J. Bulnois G.J. Timmis K.M. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1194-1198Google Scholar). The fraction of positive cells observed in this experiment is similar to the fraction of antigen (sialyl Lewis x)-positive cells seen when (sialyl Lewis x-negative) NCI-H69/E2 cells are transiently transfected with a control fucosyltransferase expression vector (pCDNAI-Fuc-TIII; (33Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Google Scholar)) (data not shown). By contrast, the PSA-negative line remains PSA-negative following transfection with the control vector pCDNAI (Fig. 1B), as do cells transfected with the STX expression vector and stained with a negative control antibody (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the human STX sequence can confer PSA expression in this N-CAM-positive cell line and are consistent with the conclusion that loss of PSA expression in this variant is a consequence of virtually complete loss of STX transcripts by these cells. It remains to be determined if this event occurs at the transcriptional or at the post-transcriptional level. The STX expression vector is also capable of generating cell surface PSA expression when introduced into the PSA-negative, N-CAM-positive murine cell line NIH-3T3 (Fig. 1B). This result demonstrates that the ability of STX to direct PSA expression is not idiosyncratic to the SCLC variant line and suggests that the catalytic specificity of human STX overlaps with that of hamster PST-1, which is also able to direct PSA expression in these cells(25Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopmann J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar).The bulk of PSA expression in mammalian tissues and cell lines is thought to be associated with N-CAM (9Nybroe O. Linnemann D. Bock E. Neurochem. Int. 1988; 12: 251-262Google Scholar, 10Zuber C. Lackie P.M. Caterall W.A. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9965-9971Google Scholar, 36Cremer H. Lange R. Christoph A. Plomann M. Vopper G. Roes J. Brown R. Baldwin S. Kraemer P. Scheff S. Barthels D. Rajewsky K. Wille W. Nature. 1994; 367: 455-459Google Scholar) and has been directly demonstrated on the SCLC cell line NCI-H69/F3(8Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar). These observations have been taken to mean that effective PSA synthesis and expression requires N-CAM, although PSA has also been detected in association with sodium channel α subunits(10Zuber C. Lackie P.M. Caterall W.A. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9965-9971Google Scholar). To directly determine if STX-directed PSA expression involves a requirement for N-CAM, STX was expressed in N-CAM-negative (data not shown) COS-7 cells, and the transfectants were assayed for PSA expression. More than 25% of the STX-transfected COS-7 cells stained with the anti-PSA monoclonal antibody mAb 735, and at levels roughly comparable to the N-CAM-positive STX transfectants. Control COS-7 transfectants remained PSA-negative. Considered together, these results indicate that STX can also determined PSA expression in the absence of N-CAM expression.The nature of the glycoconjugates that display STX-determined PSA on the cell lines we have used will require detailed structural analysis. Our experiments also do not allow us to know if STX participates in PSA expression as an “initiase” only (adds sialic acid in α(2,8) linkage to an α(2,3)-linked sialic acid precursor), or as a “polymerase” only (adds sialic acid in α(2,8) linkage to an α(2,8)-linked sialic acid precursor), or if both of these reactions are catalyzed by STX. A full biochemical resolution of this question, as it relates to STX, and to the other α(2,8)-sialyltransferases implicated in PSA expression, will require the development of an in vitro assay for PSA synthesis. INTRODUCTIONSialyltransferases represent a family of terminal glycosyltransferases that catalyze the attachment of sialic acid to carbohydrates of many glycoproteins and glycolipids(1Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Google Scholar). Sialic acids are key determinants of carbohydrate structures involved in a variety of biological processes and are widely distributed on many cell types (2Paulson J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 272-276Google Scholar, 3Brandley B.K. Swiedler S.J. Robbins P.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 861-863Google Scholar, 4Varki A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 257-266Google Scholar). Homopolymers of sialic acids in α(2,8) linkage (polysialic acid, PSA, 1The abbreviations used are: PSApolysialic acidbpbase pair(s)SCLCsmall cell lung carcinomaN-CAMneural cell adhesion moleculeRACErapid amplification of cDNA endskbkilobase(s)mAbmonoclonal antibody. also abbreviated as polySia) have a more restricted spatio-temporal tissue distribution pattern than the more commonly found α(2,6)- and α(2,3)-linked sialic acid residues. For example, PSA is expressed by neuronal tissues, in the heart and the developing kidney, and in association with malignant transformation, such as in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC)(5Vimr E.R.

Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar). Furthermore, PSA has been reported to be associated with only two proteins, the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and sodium channel α subunits(9Nybroe O. Linnemann D. Bock E. Neurochem. Int. 1988; 12: 251-262Google Scholar, 10Zuber C. Lackie P.M. Caterall W.A. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9965-9971Google Scholar). Changes in the amount of PSA on N-CAM modulates the adhesive properties of N-CAM, and also affects the cell surface properties of other molecules like some integrins, N-cadherin, and G4/NgCAM(11Acheson A. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 479-486Google Scholar, 12Acheson A. Sunshine L.J. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 143-153Google Scholar, 13Rutishauser U. Acheson A. Hall A.K. Mann D.M. Sunshine J. Science. 1988; 240: 53-57Google Scholar, 14Yang P.F. Yin X.H. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1487-1496Google Scholar). These effects are presumed to be due to the unusual physicochemical properties of this very large, abundant, negatively charged, and linear cell surface polyglycan(14Yang P.F. Yin X.H. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1487-1496Google Scholar).A requirement for N-CAM as an acceptor molecule in PSA synthesis is implied from several studies(15Breen K.C. Regan C.M. Development. 1985; 104: 147-154Google Scholar, 16McCoy R.D. Vimr E.R. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12695-12699Google Scholar), although this has not been demonstrated directly. Other studies suggest that PSA biosynthesis involves the concerted activity of two or more specific sialyltransferases(16McCoy R.D. Vimr E.R. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12695-12699Google Scholar, 17Kitazume S. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10330-10340Google Scholar). This includes a requirement for one or more α(2,3)-sialyltransferases to create α(2,3)-linked sialic acid moieties, that in turn are the presumed acceptor substrate for subsequent addition of α(2,8)-linked sialic acid moieties(18Livingston B.D. De Robertis E.M. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1990; 1: 39-44Google Scholar, 19Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11966-11970Google Scholar). It is possible that PSA synthesis then proceeds through a two-step process involving the addition of a single α(2,8)-linked sialic acid residue to the α(2,3)-linked sialic acid by one distinct α(2,8)-sialyltransferase (an “initiase” reaction), followed by the addition of multiple α(2,8)-linked sialic acid residues that yield PSA by a second distinct α(2,8)-sialyltransferase (a “polymerase” reaction). This possibility is supported by in vitro experiments indicating that at least three different α(2,8)-sialyltransferases (ST8SiaI, GD3 synthase, (20Sasaki K. Kurata K. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Ohta S.

Hamamoto T. Tsjui S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar)) can catalyze the attachment of a single α(2,8)-linked sialic acid residue to terminal α(2,3)-sialic acid linkages.Alternatively, a single α(2,8)-sialyltransferase may operate to directly catalyze PSA synthesis on a glycoconjugate template containing a terminal α(2,3)-linked sialic acid. This notion is supported by the recent demonstration that expression of a single α(2,8)-sialyltransferase gene, termed PST-1(25Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopmann J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar), or PST(26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Google Scholar), is sufficient for the expression of PSA in N-CAM-positive, PSA-negative mammalian cell lines (CHO-2A10, NIH-3T3, and COS-hN-6, a COS cell line expressing with human N-CAM-140 cDNA, (25Eckhardt M. Muehlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopmann J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar); COS-1 cells and HeLa cells transfected with an N-CAM expression vector, (26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Google Scholar)). In principle, both such modes of PSA synthesis may exist, although this remains to be confirmed, since it has not yet been possible to recreate polymerization of α(2,8)-linked sialic acids in vitro.The STX gene represents a member of the sialyltransferase gene family whose developmentally regulated expression patterns correlate well with PSA expression in certain tissues(1Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Google Scholar, 24Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Kurosawa N. Hamamoto T. Tsjui S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14628-14633Google Scholar, 27Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Google Scholar). A role for this sequence in PSA expression remained circumstantial, however, since initial efforts failed to demonstrate an enzymatic activity associated with the (rat) STX polypeptide(27Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Google Scholar). Subsequent efforts have demonstrated that a recombinant (mouse) STX-protein A fusion protein can catalyze the synthesis of a single α(2,8)-sialic acid linkage in vitro(23Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a definitive demonstration that STX participates in PSA expression, in vitro or in vivo, has not been accomplished.We show here that STX expression correlates with PSA expression in a PSA-positive human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell line (NCI-H69/F3)(8Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar), whereas STX transcripts are absent from a variant of this line selected to be PSA-negative (NCI-H69/E2)(8Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M. Papay J. Roth J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 95-106Google Scholar). Transfection of the PSA-negative variant SCLC line with an STX expression vector restores PSA expression in that line, and in other PSA-negative cell lines. The observations imply that transcriptional regulation of STX can regulate PSA expression, suggest that STX shares overlapping enzymatic activity with PST-1/PST, and imply that determination of PSA expression by STX can be independent of N-CAM expression."

EBNA1 appears to bind DNA via two independent regions termed the core and the flanking DNA-binding domains. The core DNA-binding domain, which comprises both the dimerization domain and a helix predicted to bind the inner portion of the EBNA1 DNA recognition element, was remarkably similar to the structure of the papillomavirus E2 protein, despite a complete lack of sequence conservation. The flanking DNA-binding domain, only a portion of which is contained in the current structure, consists in part of an alpha helix whose N-terminus contacts the outer regions of the EBNA1 DNA recognition element."
https://openalex.org/W1991644963,"The integrin α6β4, a receptor for members of the laminin family of basement membrane components, contributes to the function of epithelial cells and their oncogenically transformed derivatives. In our efforts to study α6β4-mediated functions in more detail and to assess the contribution of the β4 cytoplasmic domain in such functions, we identified a rectal carcinoma cell line that lacks expression of the β4 integrin subunit. This cell line, termed RKO, expresses α6β1 but not α6β4, and it interacts with laminin-1 less avidly than similar cell lines that express α6β4. We expressed a full-length β4 cDNA, as well as a mutant cDNA that lacks the β4 cytoplasmic domain, in RKO cells and isolated stable subclones of these transfectants. In this study, we report that subclones that expressed the full-length β4 cDNA in association with endogenous α6 exhibited partial G1 arrest and apoptosis, properties that were not evident in RKO cells transfected with either the cytoplasmic domain mutant or the expression vector alone. In an effort to define a mechanism for these observed changes in growth, we observed that expression of the α6β4 integrin induced expression of the p21 (WAF1; CiP1) protein, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. These data suggest that the β4 integrin cytoplasmic domain is linked to a signaling pathway involved in cell cycle regulation in the β4 transfected RKO cells."
https://openalex.org/W2072169747,"We present evidence that Dictyostelium slug tip cells, the pstA cells, may arise by positional differentiation, but at a site remote from that which they will eventually occupy. When first detectable, the pstA cells form a peripheral ring surrounding the other prestalk cell subtype, the pstO cells, but subsequently move above the pstO cells to form the tip. Because pstA cell differentiation requires a 10-fold higher concentration of differentiation-inducing factor, the stalk cell inducer, the initial patterning seems likely to reflect the existence of a morphogenetic gradient. The subsequent redistribution of the two cell types is explicable by their different rates of chemotaxis to cyclic AMP. These results help reconcile the two apparently opposing views of pattern formation in Dictyostelium, that there is positional differentiation and that pattern formation occurs by cell sorting."

The κB site was unique in that it bound constitutive nuclear protein complexes containing p50 or p52, but not inducible nuclear protein complexes containing p65.

INTRODUCTIONTrafficking of leukocytes into inflammatory sites requires the regulated expression of adhesion molecules on activated endothelial cells(1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Google Scholar, 2McEver R.P. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11025-11028Google Scholar). Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1interleukin-1BAECbovine aortic endothelial cellsHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsICAM-1intercellular adhesion molecule-1LPSlipopolysaccharideTNF-αtumor necrosis factor αVCAM-1vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. TNF-α, and LPS induce human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to transcribe mRNAs encoding the adhesion molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Transcription increases within 1-2 h and persists for 6-72 h, depending on the stimulus and the gene(3McEver R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 840-849Google Scholar, 4Bevilacqua M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 767-804Google Scholar). During active mRNA transcription, newly synthesized protein appears on the cell surface. In contrast to these adhesion proteins, P-selectin is constitutively synthesized by megakaryocytes (the precursors of platelets) and endothelial cells, where it is packaged into the membranes of secretory granules(5McEver R.P. Lipsky P.E. Rothlein R. Kishimoto T.K. Faanes R.B. Smith C.W. Structure, Function, and Regulation of Molecules Involved in Leukocyte Adhesion. Springer-Verlag, New York1993: 135-150Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of these cells by agonists such as thrombin, P-selectin is rapidly redistributed to the plasma membrane. In vivo, LPS and TNF-α markedly increase P-selectin transcripts and protein in endothelial cells of multiple tissues (6Sanders W.E. Wilson R.W. Ballantyne C.M. Beaudet A.L. Blood. 1992; 80: 795-800Google Scholar, 7Weller A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15176-15183Google Scholar, 8Gotsch U. Jager U. Dominis M. Vestweber D. Cell Adhes.

These agonists also augment P-selectin mRNA levels in cultured murine, rat, and bovine endothelial cells(7Weller A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15176-15183Google Scholar, 9Auchampach J.A. Oliver M.G. Anderson D.C. Manning A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 251-255Google Scholar, 10Hahne M. Jäger U. Isenmann S. Hallmann R. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 655-664Google Scholar). However, LPS and TNF-α do not increase P-selectin transcripts in cultured HUVEC, 2L. Yao, J. Pan, H. Setiadi, K. D. Patel, and R. P. McEver, manuscript in preparation. suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of P-selectin differs from that of E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1.We have previously isolated and conducted a preliminary analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the human P-selectin gene(11Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Google Scholar). Transcription of the gene is initiated at multiple sites, consistent with the lack of a canonical TATA box in the promoter region. The sequence from −249 to −13 relative to the translational start site confers tissue-specific expression of a reporter gene in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Serial deletions of this sequence revealed at least three positive regulatory regions; a GATA element in the region from −197 to −147 was demonstrated to be functional. The region from −249 to −197 contains at least three potential elements, including a putative recognition site for NF-κB/Rel transcription factors.The DNA-binding forms of NF-κB/Rel transcription factors are homodimers or heterodimers that bind to κB elements in many genes involved in inflammation, acute phase responses, cell proliferation, and differentiation(12Liou S.-C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Google Scholar, 13Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Google Scholar, 14Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev.

The family members share a Rel homology domain and can be divided into two groups. The first group includes Rel A (p65), Rel (c-Rel), Rel B, v-Rel, and the Drosophila proteins Dorsal and Dif. Members of this group share an acidic transactivation domain. Homodimers or heterodimers containing at least one of these molecules are retained in the cytoplasm by complex formation with IκBα and related proteins. Upon cellular stimulation, IκBα is degraded; the dimeric complexes then migrate to the nucleus where they function as potent activators of many genes with κB elements, including those for E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 (17Whelan J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8976-8983Google Scholar). The second group includes the precursor proteins p105 (NF-κB1) and p100 (NF-κB2), which are proteolytically cleaved to the mature p50 and p52 proteins, respectively. Most studies indicate that homodimers containing p50 or p52 have little or no ability to transactivate gene expression(14Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 10: 405-455Google Scholar), although there are some dissenting reports(28Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Google Scholar, 29Kretzschmar M. Meisterernst M. Scheidereit C. Li G. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 761-774Google Scholar). Homodimers of p50 are present constitutively in the nucleus of some cells, where they may prevent binding of inducible complexes containing members of the first group of proteins such as p65 (30Kang S.-M. Tran A.-C. Grilli M. Lenardo M.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1452-1456Google Scholar). Bcl-3, a protein structurally related to IκBα, dissociates bound p50 homodimers from DNA, allowing heterodimers containing p65 to bind and transactivate(31Franzoso G. Bours V. Azarenko V. Park S. Tomita-Yamaguchi M. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3893-3901Google Scholar). In contrast, Bcl-3 forms a ternary complex with p52 homodimers on DNA, resulting in transactivation(32Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Google Scholar, 33Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H-C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Google Scholar). There is disagreement as to whether Bcl-3 can form ternary complexes with p50 homodimers on DNA that transactivate(32Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Google Scholar, 33Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H-C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Google Scholar). One difficulty in interpreting the roles of p50 and p52 homodimers in gene expression has been the inability to identify κB elements that bind only to these proteins.In this paper we characterize the properties of the κB element in the human P-selectin promoter. We find that this κB site has the unique property of binding only to p50 and p52 homodimers. Interactions of Bcl-3, p52 homodimers, and the κB element augment transcription. In contrast, interactions of p50 homodimers with the κB element repress transcription; however, repression is prevented by co-expression of Bcl-3. These data suggest that differential interactions of Bcl-3 with p50 and p52 homodimers regulate the constitutive and inducible expression of the P-selectin gene, and perhaps other genes with κB sites specific for these homodimers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Proteins, Antibodies, and Expression PlasmidsCHRF-288 human megakaryocytic cells were maintained in Fisher's medium supplemented with 20% horse serum. BAEC, HUVEC, HL-60 cells, HEL cells, and Jurkat cells were cultured as described previously(11Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Google Scholar). Recombinant p50 and p49 (a variant form of p52) were obtained from Promega. Purified, bacterially expressed p50 (amino acids 1-503) and p65 were gifts from Dr. Craig Rosen(34Ruben S.M. Narayanan R. Klement J.F. Chen C.-H. Rosen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 444-454Google Scholar). Antibodies against p50, p52, and c-Rel were obtained from Santa Cruz.

Lombardi L. Neri A. Dalla-Favera R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 923-933Google Scholar). The expression plasmid p50XbaI, encoding amino acids 1-503 of p50 under the control of the Rc/CMV promoter, was provided by Dr. Rosen(34Ruben S.M. Narayanan R. Klement J.F. Chen C.-H. Rosen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 444-454Google Scholar). An expression plasmid encoding amino acids 1-401 of p50 under the control of the same promoter was constructed by polymerase chain reaction.Gel Mobility Shift AssayGel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously(11Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Google Scholar), except that KCl was used at a final concentration of 100 mM. In some experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies at room temperature for 45 min before the addition of labeled probe.Methylation Interference AssayMethylation interference analysis was performed as described previously(37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Boston, MA1994Google Scholar). Aliquots of the Seq I oligonucleotide were end-labeled on each strand. The labeled oligonucleotides were partially methylated and then incubated with recombinant p50 or p52 homodimers. Bound and free DNA were separated by native 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, eluted from the gel, and cleaved with piperidine. The cleaved products were electrophoresed in 12.5% polyacrylamide, 7.5 M urea gels and subjected to autoradiography.Construction of Chimeric Luciferase Expression VectorsPlasmid p309LUC was described previously (11Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Google Scholar) and plasmid pGL2-promoter was from Promega. Plasmid pmκB309LUC, which contained two base changes in the κB site (GGGGGTGACCCC to GCCGGTGACCCC) was constructed by an overlap extension polymerase chain reaction protocol(38Disdier M. Morrissey J.H. Fugate R.D. Bainton D.F. McEver R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 309-321Google Scholar). Plasmids p2xκBSV40 and p2xmκBSV40 were constructed through direct ligation of double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding two wild-type or mutated P-selectin κB sites into the MluI and XhoI sites of the pGL2-promoter vector. These oligonucleotides were: 5′-cgcgGAAGGGGGTGACCCCTTGCCGAAGGGGGTGACCCCTTGCC-3′ and 3′-CTTCCCCCACTGGGGAACGGCTTCCCCCACTGGGGAACGGagct-5′ for the wild-type P-selectin κB sites, and 5′-cgcgGAAGGGGGTGAATAGTTGCCGAAGGGGGTGAATAGTTGCC-3′ and 3′-CTTCCCCCACTTATCAACGGCTTCCCCCACTTATCAACGGagct-5′, for the mutant. These complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and phosphorylated(39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and then used for ligation. The fidelity of all constructs was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing.Transfection and Luciferase AssayPreparation of plasmids, transfections, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously(11Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Google Scholar), with the following minor modifications. For co-transfections, the total amount of DNA was kept constant at 10 μg/dish of cells by adding an appropriate amount of a control plasmid without an insert (pRc/CMV, Invitrogen). Equal volumes of 30 μg of test plasmids and 50 μg of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), each diluted in 3.75 ml of OptiMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), were incubated for 20 min. The resulting transfection mixture was divided into three parts, and each part was then added to cells in a separate 60-mm dish. After incubation for 7-8 h at 37°C, the transfection medium was replaced by complete medium for an additional 36 h and the cells were then harvested for luciferase assays.Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was prepared from CHRF-288 cells, HEL cells, and HUVEC by acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction(40Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar), and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously(41Johnston G.I. Cook R.G. McEver R.P. Cell. 1989; 56: 1033-1044Google Scholar).RESULTSThe Sequence from −232 to −192 in the 5′-Flanking Region of the P-selectin Gene Forms Five DNA-Nuclear Protein ComplexesWe previously showed that deletion of the sequence from −249 to −197 in the 5′-flanking region of the human P-selectin gene decreased expression of a reporter gene in transfected BAEC by ~40%(11Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Google Scholar). This region contains putative recognition elements for ETS proteins, certain zinc finger proteins induced by phorbol esters, and members of the NF-κB/Rel family of proteins. To determine whether nuclear proteins bound to this region, we synthesized a 41-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide encompassing the sequence −232 to −192, which contained all the putative regulatory elements (Fig. 1A). The labeled oligonucleotide, termed Seq I, formed five complexes with nuclear extracts from the megakaryocytic cell line CHRF-288 (Fig. 1B) and from all other cells tested (BAEC, HEL cells, Hy.EA926 hybrid endothelial cells, and Jurkat cells, data not shown). Formation of all complexes was prevented by addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Seq I probe, but not by an unlabeled probe containing an unrelated GATA element (11Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Complex II was resolved into separate complexes, termed IIa and IIb, only after electrophoresis for longer periods. Complexes III and IV were not consistently formed by all nuclear extracts from a given cell type.The κB Element in the P-selectin Promoter Binds Homodimers Containing p50 or p52 but Not Homodimers or Heterodimers Containing p65The putative κB element in Seq I is very similar to a κB element in the murine H-2Kb gene that binds constitutive p50 and p52 homodimers as well as inducible p50/p65 heterodimers (42Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 305-313Google Scholar, 43Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 723-727Google Scholar, 44Scheinman R.I. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3557-3566Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 2, a 50- to 200-fold excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide encompassing the H2-Kb sequence prevented Seq I from forming complex II, but not the other complexes, with nuclear extracts. We next synthesized a shorter oligonucleotide, termed Seq B, that contained only the sequence from −222 to −200 immediately surrounding the putative κB element (Fig. 1A). Seq B, when labeled, formed only complex II, and complex formation was specifically inhibited by addition of unlabeled Seq I, Seq B, or the H2-Kb probe (Fig. 2). These results indicate that Seq B contains a κB element that is functionally related to the element in the H2-Kb promoter.Figure 2:The κB elements in the H2-Kb gene and the P-selectin gene compete for binding to nuclear proteins from unstimulated cells. In the left panel, nuclear extracts were incubated with the labeled Seq I probe in the presence or absence of a 50-, 100-, or 200-fold excess of the unlabeled Seq I or H-2Kb oligonucleotide. In the right panel, nuclear extracts were incubated with the labeled Seq B probe in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess of the indicated unlabeled oligonucleotides. The positions of the specific DNA-protein complexes are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether Seq B bound constitutive p50 or p52 homodimers as well as inducible NF-κB dimers containing p65, we first performed gel shift assays with nuclear extracts from BAEC treated with or without phorbol myristate acetate, which induces degradation of IκBα and release of p50/p65 complexes into the nucleus (Fig. 3A). The labeled H2-Kb probe formed two complexes. The faster migrating complex, found in both unstimulated and stimulated cells, corresponded to constitutively expressed p50 or p52 homodimers. The slower moving complex represented p50/p65 heterodimers that were more abundant in extracts from stimulated cells(43Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 723-727Google Scholar). The labeled Seq B also formed the faster moving complex, but not the slower moving complex. Furthermore, unlabeled Seq B prevented the labeled H2-Kb probe from forming the faster moving complex, but not the slower moving complex (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the P-selectin κB site, unlike the H2-KbκB element, interacts with p50 or p52 homodimers but not inducible dimers containing p65. In other experiments, Seq B failed to form slower moving complexes with nuclear extracts from HUVEC treated with LPS for 2, 4, or 24 h, or from BAEC treated with TNF-α for 2 or 4 h (data not shown). Because dimers containing c-Rel also migrate to the nuclei of stimulated HUVEC(45Parry G.C.N. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20823-20825Google Scholar), this result suggests that Seq B does not bind inducible dimers containing c-Rel.Figure 3:The P-selectin κB element binds constitutive nuclear proteins but not inducible nuclear proteins. A, the labeled Seq B or H2-Kb probes were incubated with nuclear extracts from unstimulated BAEC or from BAEC stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 1 h. B, the labeled H2-Kb probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated BAEC in the presence or absence of a 50-, 100-, or 200-fold excess of the unlabeled H-2Kb or Seq B oligonucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm the differential specificities of the Seq B and H2-Kb probes, we performed gel shift assays with purified, recombinant p50, p52, and p65; each of these proteins forms homodimers when expressed in bacteria(34Ruben S.M. Narayanan R. Klement J.F. Chen C.-H. Rosen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 444-454Google Scholar). Seq B formed complexes with p50 and p52 homodimers, but not with p65 homodimers, whereas the H2-Kb probe formed complexes with all three proteins (Fig. 4A). To determine whether complexes IIa and IIb represented interactions of Seq I with p52 and p50 homodimers, we preincubated nuclear extracts or purified p50 or p52 with specific antibodies prior to gel shift analysis. To resolve complex IIa from complex IIb, electrophoresis was performed for a longer period such that the faster migrating complexes III and IV exited the gel. Antibodies to p50 supershifted complex IIb to a slower migrating position, and antibodies to p52 supershifted complex IIa (Fig. 4B). In contrast, antibodies to c-Rel had no effect on either complex. None of the antibodies affected formation of complex I. Collectively, these data indicate that the P-selectin κB element interacts with constitutively expressed nuclear complexes consisting of p50 or p52 homodimers, but not inducible nuclear complexes containing p65.Figure 4:The P-selectin κB element binds p50 and p52 homodimers but not p65 homodimers. A, the labeled Seq B and H2-Kb probes were incubated with purified recombinant homodimers containing p50, p52, or p65. B, the labeled Seq I probe was incubated with nuclear extracts from CHRF-288 cells or with purified p50 or p52, in the presence or absence of the indicated antibodies. The DNA-protein mixtures were electrophoresed for a longer period to resolve complexes IIa and IIb. Antibodies to p50 supershifted complex IIb, and antibodies to p52 supershifted complex IIa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Characterization of the Nucleotides in the P-selectin κB Sequence That Contact p50 and p52 HomodimersWe used methylation interference analysis to characterize the sites on the P-selectin κB element that bind p50 and p52 homodimers. As shown in Fig. 5, methylation of five guanines at −218 to −214 in the coding strand and four guanines at −210 to −207 in the non-coding strand suppressed binding to p52 and p50. Methylation of the guanine at −212 on the coding strand also prevented binding to both proteins, although the effect was more pronounced for p52.Figure 5:Methylation interference analysis of the nucleotides in the P-selectin κB element that contact p50 and p52 homodimers. A, aliquots of the Seq I oligonucleotide were end-labeled on each strand. The labeled oligonucleotides were partially methylated and then incubated with purified p50 or p52 homodimers. Bound and free DNA were separated by electrophoresis in native 4% polyacrylamide gels, eluted, and cleaved with piperidine. The cleaved products were resolved in 12.5% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels and subjected to autoradiography. B, sequence of the P-selectin κB element. The filled symbols indicate guanines that, when methylated, blocked binding of the oligonucleotide to p50 or p52. The open symbols indicate guanines that, when methylated, partially inhibited binding of the oligonucleotide to p50 or p52.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The three core nucleotides at −213 to −211 in the P-selectin κB element differ from those in the H2-Kb element, suggesting that they are important for recognition specificity. We used gel shift assays to test the effects of some changes in the core sequence of the κB element of Seq I. Substitution of the G at −212 with C or A preserved recognition specificity for p50 and p52 homodimers, whereas substitution to T also conferred binding to p50/p65 heterodimers (data not shown). No clear rules for recognition specificity emerged from this limited survey. In conjunction with the results from methylation interference analysis, however, the data indicate that p50 and p52 homodimers bind specifically to four symmetrical guanines on each strand. These guanines are separated by three core nucleotides that participate in recognition specificity.The κB Element Is Required for Optimal Constitutive Expression of the P-selectin GeneTo determine whether the κB element was required for optimal constitutive expression of P-selectin, we changed two guanines at −217 and −216 to cytosines (Fig. 6A). These mutations specifically affected the binding site for NF-κB proteins; a Seq I oligonucleotide containing the mutations did not form complex II but did form other protein complexes with nuclear extracts from CHRF-288 cells (Fig. 6B). The mutant oligonucleotide also failed to bind purified p50 or p52 dimers (Fig. 6C). The same two mutations were then introduced into a luciferase reporter gene driven by the P-selectin 5′-flanking sequence from −309 to −13. When transfected into BAEC, the mutant construct was expressed at levels ~40% lower than those of the wild-type sequence (Fig. 6D). The reduction in expression was similar to that produced by deletion of the region from −309 to −197(11Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Google Scholar). These data indicate that a functional κB element is required for optimal constitutive expression of the P-selectin gene in BAEC.Figure 6:A mutation in the P-selectin κB element eliminates binding to p50 and p52 homodimers and decreases constitutive promoter activity. A, sequence of wild-type and mutant Seq I probes used in gel shift studies. B, the wild-type or mutant Seq I probes were incubated with nuclear extracts from CHRF-288 cells. The mutant probe failed to form complex II. C, the wild-type or mutant Seq I probes were incubated with purified recombinant p50 or p52 homodimers. D, the same mutations were introduced into a luciferase reporter gene driven by the P-selectin 5′-flanking sequence from −309 to −13. The mutant and wild-type reporter genes were transfected into BAEC, and the luciferase activities were measured. The activities of the wild-type promoter gene were normalized to 100%. The data represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Triplicate transfections were performed in each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Function of the P-selectin κB Element Is Differentially Regulated by Interactions of p50 and p52 Homodimers with Bcl-3Interactions of p50 and p52 homodimers with Bcl-3 have been reported to stimulate or r"
https://openalex.org/W1971003904,"Sky (also called Rse, Brt, and Tyro3) is a member of a subfamily of related receptor tyrosine kinases, including Axl/Ufo/Ark and c-Eyk/Mer. We obtained evidence that Gas6 (the product of growth arrest-specific gene 6) is a ligand of the Sky receptor tyrosine kinase. Gas6, but not protein S (an anticoagulant protein structurally similar to Gas6), specifically bound to the soluble form of Sky (Sky-Fc), composed of the extracellular domain of Sky fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1. The native and recombinant Gas6, but not protein S, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Stimulation of Sky in response to Gas6 was inhibited by Sky-Fc. The half-maximal concentration of Gas6 that stimulated Sky was about 1 nM. Thus, Gas6 as a ligand for Sky specifically binds to and stimulates Sky receptor tyrosine kinase.

INTRODUCTIONReceptor tyrosine kinases play a central role in transducing the external signals across cell membranes into intracellular signaling systems and these signals lead to cell proliferation, differentiation, and other responses(1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-211Google Scholar). Based on similarities of the sequences of kinase catalytic domains and the structural motifs in the extracellular domains, these receptors can be classified into subfamilies(1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-211Google Scholar). The members of an Axl/Sky receptor subfamily, which include Axl (also called Ufo and Ark)(2O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A.

Axl was originally identified as the oncogene for human myelogenic leukemia(2O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A. Kitch B. Prokop C. Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M.M. Earp H.S. Liu E.T. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1839-1844Google Scholar). Overexpression of Axl and Sky led to cell transformation(2O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A. Kitch B. Prokop C. Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M.M.

Northern blot analysis revealed that the Sky transcripts are predominantly expressed in the brain(5Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T.

The ligands for Axl and Sky were recently reported to be the product of growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) 1The abbreviations used are: Gas6the protein encoded by growth arrest-specific gene 6APCactivated protein CCHOChinese hamster ovaryEGFepidermal growth factorFGFfibroblast growth factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered saline, VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells. and protein S, respectively(13Varnum B.C.

Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein that has anticoagulant activity by acting as a cofactor of activated protein C (APC)-catalyzed inactivation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa(15Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 49-61Google Scholar). Gas6, originally identified as a gene product expressed in response to growth arrest, has structural similarity to protein S with 42-43% identity (16Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Google Scholar) and was seen to function as a potentiating factor for thrombin-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC)(17Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Google Scholar).Prior to investigating the physiological functions of Sky and its reported ligand protein S, we examined the potential of protein S to bind to Sky and to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky. In contrast to an earlier report(14Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. Masiakowski P. Ryan T.E. Tobkes N.J. Chen D.H. DiStefano P.S. Long G.L. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.P. Lemke G. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Google Scholar), we found no specific binding of protein S to Sky or stimulation of Sky tyrosine phosphorylation by protein S. Gas6, not protein S, did show potent activity to bind to Sky and to induce the phosphorylation of Sky. We describe here our evidence that Gas6 is the ligand for Sky.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of Gas6 and Protein SGas6 was purified from the conditioned medium of rat VSMC, according to the methods described elsewhere(17Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Google Scholar). The purity of Gas6 was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis(17Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Google Scholar). Protein S was purified from normal human plasma by the reported procedures(18Suzuki K. Nishioka J. Hashimoto S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 699-705Google Scholar, 19Dahlbäck B. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 837-846Google Scholar). Based on the SDS-PAGE analysis, under reducing conditions, the preparations of protein S used in this study contained almost equal amounts of thrombin-cleaved and uncleaved protein S(18Suzuki K. Nishioka J. Hashimoto S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 699-705Google Scholar). The purified protein S had APC cofactor activity and also inhibited the activity of the platelet prothrombinase complex(20Hayashi T. Nishioka J. Suzuki K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73 (abstr.): 1259Google Scholar).Expression of Recombinant Gas6 and Protein SThe cDNA encoding rat Gas6 was obtained as previously reported(17Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding human protein S was provided by Dr. B. Dahlbäck (21Malm G. Xuhua H.E. Bjartell A. Shen L. Abrahamsson P.-A. Dahlbäck B. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 845-850Google Scholar). The cDNAs were subcloned into the PUC-SRα expression plasmid(22Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Google Scholar), and the constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells using liposome methods(23Ito A. Miyazoe R. Mitoma J. Akao T. Osaki T. Kunitake T. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 235-241Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 3 days in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10 μM sodium menadione bisulfite. Levels of proteins expressed in the conditioned media (100-1000 ng/ml) were determined by immunoblotting with anti-Gas6 or anti-protein S antibodies.AntibodiesRabbit anti-Sky polyclonal antibody (Sky-C) raised against the C-terminal peptide of human Sky was prepared and purified as described previously(24Toshima J. Ohashi K. Iwashita S. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 656-663Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-protein S polyclonal antibody was raised against the purified human protein S, as described elsewhere(25Hayashi T. Nishioka J. Shigekiyo T. Saito S. Suzuki K. Blood. 1994; 83: 683-690Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Gas6 antiserum was raised against the purified Gas6. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY20) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals.Construction and Purification of Fc Fusion ProteinsThe cDNA encoding human Sky was isolated, as reported elsewhere(5Ohashi K.

The KpnI fragment encoding the entire extracellular domain (amino acid residues 1-430) of the Sky protein was fused in-frame with the PCR-amplified cDNA fragment of the Fc region (residues 216-443) of human IgG1, resulting in the production of the cDNA coding for the Sky-Fc fusion protein with a Pro-Gly spacer sequence. In a similar manner, the cDNA for the extracellular domain (residues 1-941) of c-Met was ligated with the cDNA encoding the Fc region of human IgG1 to construct the cDNA for Met-Fc fusion protein with a spacer sequence, Pro-Gly-Val-Pro-Gly. The fused cDNAs were then subcloned into PUC-SRα expression vector (22Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Google Scholar) and transfected into COS-7 cells, using liposome methods. The serum-free conditioned media of COS cells were collected for three days. The Fc fusion proteins were purified by Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) chromatography. Levels of the fusion proteins expressed in the conditioned media were on an average of 100-200 ng/ml.Binding Assay of Gas6 and Protein S to Fc Fusion ProteinsPurified rat Gas6 or human protein S at a final concentration of 2 nM was incubated at 4°C overnight with 5 nM Sky-Fc or Met-Fc fusion protein and Protein A-Sepharose (30 μl of 50% slurry) in 200 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.02% NaN3, and 1% bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation, the precipitates were washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), suspended in SDS sampling buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 5% glycerol, 1% SDS, 144 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue), and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. The gels were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and the membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-Gas6 or anti-protein S antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20. After washing the membrane with PBS, it was incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Corp.) and immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham).Construction of CHO Cell Lines Expressing SkyA 3.8-kb human sky cDNA (5Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 699-705Google Scholar) was subcloned into the NotI site of the expression vector pRc/RSV (Invitrogen) containing the neomycin-resistant gene. The resulting plasmid was transfected into CHO cells using liposome methods, and the G418-resistant colonies were selected. One of the cell lines (B31) with high Sky expression, as measured by immunoblot analysis, was selected.Tyrosine Phosphorylation AssayB31 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 16 h, cells were serum-starved for 3 h and treated with Gas6 or protein S for 10 min at 37°C, as indicated. Cells were rinsed once with cold PBS containing 1 mM orthovanadate and lysed with cold lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sky antibody, run on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Sky antibody or anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, as described previously(24Toshima J. Ohashi K. Iwashita S. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 656-663Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine the binding potential of protein S and Gas6 to Sky, we prepared a chimeric protein (Sky-Fc) that contains the extracellular ligand-binding domain of Sky fused to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin IgG1 heavy chain. Affinity adsorption and precipitation analysis using Fc fusion proteins in the presence of Protein A-Sepharose showed that Sky-Fc, but not Met-Fc (a control chimeric protein composed of the extracellular domain of c-Met and the Fc region of human IgG1), specifically co-precipitated Gas6 protein (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, protein S was not co-precipitated by either Sky-Fc or Met-Fc (Fig. 1B). These observations suggest that Gas6 but not protein S can specifically bind to the extracellular domain of Sky.Ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases bind to their cognate receptors, then rapidly stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptors. To determine if Gas6 and/or protein S could stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky, we constructed CHO cells stably expressing the full-length Sky receptor tyrosine kinase. Immunoblot analysis using the anti-Sky antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide of Sky revealed that the Sky protein with an apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa was detected in Sky-transfected (B31) cells, while the parental CHO cells showed no detectable immunoreactive band (Fig. 2A). Cell surface biotinylation experiments revealed that a 140-kDa protein immunoprecipitated with anti-Sky antibody was exposed at the cell surface (data not shown). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky expressed on B31 cells was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody after immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates with anti-Sky antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, phosphorylation of Sky was induced when the B31 cells were treated with Gas6 (compare lanes 1 and 2), but not when treated with protein S (lane 4), while the amount of Sky in the immunoprecipitates remained unchanged. No immunoreactive band with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was detected in the anti-Sky immunoprecipitates of the parental CHO cells treated with Gas6 (Fig. 2B, lane 5). These results clearly show that Gas6 but not protein S can stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the Sky receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in B31 cells. Additionally, phosphorylation of Sky in response to Gas6 was almost completely blocked in the presence of excess amounts of Sky-Fc (Fig. 2B, lane 3). This means that Sky phosphorylation was induced by direct interaction between Gas6 and Sky and not by indirect cross-phosphorylation of Sky by other receptor tyrosine kinases.Figure 2:Tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky on B31 cells in response to purified Gas6. A, immunoblot analysis of Sky expression on CHO cells and B31 cells. Cell lysates of parental CHO cells (lane 1) and sky cDNA-transfected CHO cells (B31 cells) (lane 2) were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Sky antibody (α-Sky). B, B31 cells (lanes 1-4) and CHO cells (lanes 5 and 6) were treated for 10 min at 37°C with 2 nM Gas6 purified from conditioned media of VSMC or protein S (PS) purified from human plasma, as indicated. In lane 3, Gas6 (2 nM) was preincubated with excess amounts of Sky-Fc (20 nM). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sky antibody, run on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (α-pY, upper panel) or anti-Sky antibody (α-Sky, lower panel). Elution position of Sky is indicated by an arrow. Molecular sizes (kDa) of marker proteins are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To exclude the possibility that the Gas6 preparation purified from VSMC used in this study might be contaminated by the protein activating Sky, recombinant Gas6 was expressed in COS cells and examined to observe if it would stimulate Sky phosphorylation. Recombinant protein S was also expressed and examined, in parallel experiments. Expression of Gas6 and protein S in culture supernatants of COS cells transfected with each expression plasmid was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the culture supernatants of COS cells expressing recombinant Gas6 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky, whereas the supernatants of mock-transfected COS cells and the supernatants of COS cells expressing recombinant protein S had no detectable activity. These observations also show that Gas6 but not protein S stimulates Sky tyrosine phosphorylation.Figure 3:Tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky on B31 cells in response to recombinant Gas6. A, immunoblot analysis of recombinant rat Gas6 and human protein S transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The culture supernatants of COS cells transfected with rat Gas6 or human protein S cDNA expression plasmid were concentrated, run on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Gas6 or anti-protein S antibody. B, B31 cells were treated for 10 min at 37°C with the culture supernatants of mock-transfected COS cells (lane 2) or the cells transfected with human protein S (lane 3) or rat Gas6 expression plasmid (lane 4). C, effects of EGTA on tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky in response to Gas6. B31 cells were treated for 10 min at 37°C with 2 nM recombinant rat Gas6 in the presence or absence of 10 mM EGTA. In B and C, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with α-Sky, run on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with α-pY (upper panel) or α-Sky antibody (lower panel), as described in Fig. 2. Elution position of Sky is indicated by an arrow. Molecular sizes (kDa) of marker proteins are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Protein S contains 11 γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues in the N-terminal Gla domain, one β-hydroxyaspartic acid residue in the first epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and three β-hydroxyasparagine residues in three other EGF-like domains(15Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 49-61Google Scholar). These modified residues appear to be involved in Ca2+ binding(15Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 49-61Google Scholar). As these residues are conserved in the sequence of Gas6, Gas6 may also bind Ca2+ ions through these residues(16Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Google Scholar, 17Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Google Scholar). To examine the effects of Ca2+ ion on Sky-stimulating activity of Gas6, recombinant Gas6 was treated with EGTA and lost all activity (Fig. 3C). Therefore, Ca2+ ion binding is essential for the conformation and activity of Gas6 to bind to and stimulate Sky.Recombinant Gas6 purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture medium of COS cells transfected with Gas6 expression plasmid stimulated Sky phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky was detectable at 0.5 nM of recombinant Gas6 and the half-maximal stimulation was obtained at approximately 1 nM. The concentration of Gas6 required for stimulation of Sky is comparable to the Kd value (0.3 nM) of the binding of Gas6 to membranes of VSMC, for which Gas6 has growth potentiating activity(17Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Google Scholar).Figure 4:Dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky in response to purified recombinant rat Gas6. Recombinant Gas6 was purified from the culture supernatants of COS-7 cells transfected with rat Gas6 expression plasmid. Serum-starved B31 cells were treated for 10 min at 37°C with the indicated concentrations of purified recombinant Gas6. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with α-pY (upper panel) or α-Sky antibody (lower panel), as described in Fig. 2. Elution position of Sky is indicated by an arrow. Molecular sizes (kDa) of marker proteins are indicated on the left. B, relative levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky are plotted as a function of the concentration of Gas6 added. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky were calculated by dividing the density of anti-phosphotyrosine immunoreactive band by the density of anti-Sky immunoreactive band. The density was evaluated from data in A by NIH image software. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Sky when treated with 10 nM recombinant rat Gas6 was taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In light of all these findings, we propose that Gas6, but not protein S, is a ligand for Sky, specifically binding to Sky and stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation. Our observations differ from those of Stitt et al.(14Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. Masiakowski P. Ryan T.E. Tobkes N.J. Chen D.H. DiStefano P.S. Long G.L. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.P. Lemke G. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Google Scholar). They reported that protein S but not Gas6 efficiently binds to and stimulates mouse Sky (Tyro3). Although the Sky receptor they used was of a different species (mouse Sky used by Stitt et al.(14Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. Masiakowski P. Ryan T.E. Tobkes N.J. Chen D.H. DiStefano P.S. Long G.L. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.P. Lemke G. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Google Scholar) versus human Sky used in our study), the species difference would not likely explain the different results in ligand specificity, because sequences of human and mouse Sky are highly homologous (85% identity within their extracellular domains). If all results are compiled, human protein S does bind to mouse Sky (as described by Stitt et al.), but does not bind to human Sky (as described here). As the purified human protein S used in our study retained both APC cofactor activity and inhibitory activity of the prothrombinase complex activity(20Hayashi T. Nishioka J. Suzuki K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73 (abstr.): 1259Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the purified protein S we used was structurally damaged. Thus, at present we have no valid explanation for the discrepancy between the results obtained in this study and those by Stitt et al.(14Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. Masiakowski P. Ryan T.E. Tobkes N.J. Chen D.H. DiStefano P.S. Long G.L. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.P. Lemke G. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Google Scholar).Two different research groups reported that Gas6 is the ligand for Axl, a receptor closely related to Sky(13Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliott G. Garcia A. Bartley T.D. Fridell Y.-W. Hunt R.W. Trail G. Clogston C. Toso R.J. Yanagihara D. Bennett L. Sylber M. Merewether L.A. Tseng A. Escobar E. Liu E.T. Yamane H.K. Nature. 1995; 373: 623-626Google Scholar, 14Stitt T.N. Conn G. Gore M. Lai C. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Mattsson K. Fisher J. Gies D.R. Jones P.F. Masiakowski P. Ryan T.E. Tobkes N.J. Chen D.H. DiStefano P.S. Long G.L. Basilico C. Goldfarb M.P. Lemke G. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Google Scholar). The effective dose of Gas6 to Sky shown in this study is comparable to the reported value for Gas6-Axl interaction(13Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliott G. Garcia A. Bartley T.D. Fridell Y.-W. Hunt R.W. Trail G. Clogston C. Toso R.J. Yanagihara D. Bennett L. Sylber M. Merewether L.A. Tseng A. Escobar E. Liu E.T. Yamane H.K. Nature. 1995; 373: 623-626Google Scholar). Thus, Gas6 may be a common ligand for the two related receptors, Sky and Axl. The binding of a ligand to two distinct members of a receptor subfamily is also seen for fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family ligands (acidic FGF and basic FGF), both of which bind to two members of an FGF receptor subfamily, Flg and Bek, with similar affinity constants(28Dionne C.A. Crumley G.C. Bellot F. Kaplow J.M. Searfoss G. Ruta M. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2685-2692Google Scholar), and the ligands for Eph family receptors (B61 and EHK1-L), which bind to two members of an Eph receptor subfamily, Eck and EHK-1, with similar affinity constants (29Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Google Scholar). Although neither the functions of Gas6 nor the physiological significance of receptor redundancy are well understood, Gas6 may exhibit diverse functions in a cell and tissue-dependent manner through two distinct receptors, Sky and Axl, whose expression patterns differ significantly.Identification of the ligand for Sky should pave the way to initiate research on the functional roles of Sky and its ligand Gas6. As Sky is expressed predominantly in neurons in restricted regions of the brain (6Ohashi K. Honda S. Ichinomiya N. Nakamura T. Mizuno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1267-1275Google Scholar), future study will focus on the biological function of Gas6 on neurons. As Sky is also expressed in some extents in other tissues, such as testis, ovary and kidney, and in certain types of cells(5Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 699-705Google Scholar, 6Ohashi K. Honda S. Ichinomiya N. Nakamura T. Mizuno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1267-1275Google Scholar, 7Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6872-6880Google Scholar), the functional roles of Gas6 to these tissues and cells may be identified. Gas6 potentiates cell proliferation of VSMC stimulated by Ca2+-mobilizing growth factors, such as thrombin, and may be involved in intimal thickening of the vascular wall accompanying atherosclerosis or restenosis(17Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Google Scholar). To develop antagonists for Gas6 that will aid in overcoming these vascular diseases, it is also important to clearly define which receptor, Sky or Axl, mediates the action of Gas6 on VSMC. In addition, it will be interesting to search for other members of the protein S-related protein family, which may function as ligands for Sky-related receptors such as c-Eyk INTRODUCTIONReceptor tyrosine kinases play a central role in transducing the external signals across cell membranes into intracellular signaling systems and these signals lead to cell proliferation, differentiation, and other responses(1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-211Google Scholar). Based on similarities of the sequences of kinase catalytic domains and the structural motifs in the extracellular domains, these receptors can be classified into subfamilies(1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-211Google Scholar). The members of an Axl/Sky receptor subfamily, which include Axl (also called Ufo and Ark)(2O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1839-1844Google Scholar). Overexpression of Axl and Sky led to cell transformation(2O'Bryan J.P. Frye R.A. Cogswell P.C. Neubauer A. Kitch B. Prokop C. Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M.M.

https://openalex.org/W1528384739,"This paper shows the presence of high-affinity binding sites for melatonin in human circulating T lymphocytes, but not in B lymphocytes. The binding of melatonin to T cells was dependent on time, stable, reversible, saturable, specific, and inversely correlated to the production of melatonin, expressed as the nocturnal 12 h production of its urinary metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin. The affinity of these binding sites (Kd = 0.27 nM) suggests that they may recognize the physiological concentrations of melatonin in serum. Moreover, among the lymphocyte subpopulations studied, binding of melatonin was mostly found in CD4+ cells rather than in CD8+ cells.

In this study we have tested the hypothesis that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)/IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) interaction is a rate-limiting step for SMC replication by blocking this interaction with a synthetic D-amino acid peptide structurally resembling the D-domain of IGF-1. After rat carotid artery denudation, semiquantitative PCR analysis demonstrated a significant elevation of IGF-1, platelet-derived growth factor B, transforming growth factor beta 1, and epidermal growth factor mRNAs 10 days after endothelial injury, concomitantly with the induction of intimal SMC proliferation and intimal thickening. Administration of 10-30 micrograms.kg-1.day-1 of D-analog of IGF-1, devoid of proteolytic degradation in body fluids, reduced intimal SMC replication by 60-70%. The peptide also inhibited [3H]TdR incorporation and [3H]glycine incorporation in cultured SMCs by 60-80%, whereas a ""scrambled"" control peptide consisting of the same amino acids had no effect. The results suggest that IGF-1/IGF-1R interaction is a rate-limiting step for SMC replication. Blocking of this interaction with stabile D-peptide analog of IGF-1 at the level of IGF-1R may offer an entirely new approach for the prophylaxis and treatment of restenosis after cardiac revascularization procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2090449516,"Phospholipase D (PLD) activation by guanine nucleotides requires protein cofactors from both the membrane and the cytosol. The small GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) has been established as one important component of PLD activation. By stimulating HL-60 cells with various agonists and then isolating the membrane fraction and assaying PLD activity in the presence and absence of GTPγS, we observed that fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and phorbol esters induced a potentiation of GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity in the membrane fractions of these cells. Inactive phorbol esters induced no such potentiation. Both fMLP and active phorbol esters induced a 2-3-fold increase in GTPγS-stimulated PLD in HL-60 membranes. Membranes derived from stimulated HL-60 cells contained 60-70% more ARF as compared with membranes derived from control cells. Membrane contents of ARF were assessed by Western blotting with the anti-ARF monoclonal antibody 1D9 followed by densitometric evaluation. Therefore, ARF translocation correlates with the potentiation of the GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity. The effect on PLD activity and ARF membrane content achieved through fMLP stimulation was greatly enhanced by prior treatment of the cells with cytochalasin B. Membranes derived from control and fMLP-stimulated cells were assayed for PLD activity in the presence of exogenous ARF and a 50-kDa fraction known to contain elements implicated in PLD activation. The ability of ARF and the 50-kDa fraction to enhance GTPγS-sensitive PLD activity was significantly reduced when the membranes were derived from fMLP-stimulated cells. The data indicate that, in addition to ARF, elements of the 50-kDa PLD-inducing factors were likely already translocated to the membranes upon stimulation. We propose that ARF, upon stimulation with agonists such as fMLP or phorbol esters, is translocated to the membrane and in concert with other protein components of the 50-kDa fraction enhances PLD activity.

https://openalex.org/W2066825888,"The modulation of the affinity of DNA-binding proteins by small molecule effectors for cognate DNA sites is common to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the mechanisms by which effector binding to one domain affects DNA binding by a distal domain are poorly understood structurally. In initial studies to provide insight into the mechanism of effector-modulated DNA binding of the lactose repressor family, we determined the crystal structure of the purine repressor bound to a corepressor and purF operator. To extend our understanding, we have determined the structure of the corepressor-free corepressor-binding domain of the purine repressor at 2.2 A resolution. In the unliganded state, structural changes in the corepressor-binding pocket cause each subunit to rotate open by as much as 23 degrees, the consequences of which are the disengagement of the minor groove-binding hinge helices and repressor-DNA dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W2120356456,"To study cytokine regulation of the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO)/leukotriene (LT) synthase pathway we have developed mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) that minimally express each protein of the pathway by using a novel culture system, lacking interleukin (IL)-3. When mouse bone marrow cells were cultured for 5 weeks with 100 ng/ml c-kit ligand (KL) and 10 units/ml IL-10, a population of >95% mast cells was obtained.

When these BMMC were cultured for 2-5 weeks more with 100 units/ml IL-3 in the continued presence of KL and IL-10, the IgE-dependent generation of LTC4 and PGD2 increased to 212 ± 36 and 25.5 ± 8.6 ng/106 cells, respectively. The dramatic increase in the IgE-dependent generation of LTC4 in response to IL-3 was accompanied by a concomitant increase in expression of 5-LO and 5-LO-activating protein and preceded the increased expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and LTC4 synthase. The recognition that IL-3 up-regulates the expression of each protein of the 5-LO pathway for the generation of LTC4 contrasts with our recent finding that KL up-regulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2, prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1, and hematopoietic PGD2 synthase and increases the IgE-dependent generation of PGD2 in BMMC developed from bone marrow with IL-3. Thus, developmentally segregated regulation of the prostanoid and cysteinyl leukotriene pathways in lineage-related committed mast cell progenitors reveals the pleiotropism of this effector cell of allergic inflammation, a cytokine/growth factor basis for preferential expression of pathways of eicosanoid biosynthesis, and the particular role of IL-3 in regulating the expression of the proteins of the 5-LO/LTC4 synthase pathway.

Arm J.P. Austen K.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 744: 84-98Google Scholar). Mouse and rat serosal mast cells, generally studied as a surrogate for CTMC, respond to IgE-dependent activation with preferred generation of the cyclooxygenase pathway product, prostaglandin (PG) D2(2Katz H.R. Raizman M.B. Gartner C.S. Scott H.C. Benson A.C. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 868-871Google Scholar), whereas rat MMC generate leukotriene (LT) C4 via the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway in preference to PGD2(3Heavey D.J. Ernst P.B. Stevens R.L. Befus A.D.

Mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) developed in WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium as a source of interleukin (IL)-3 represent a relatively immature population of committed mast cell progenitors that reconstitutes both CTMC and MMC in mast cell-deficient mice of the WBB6F1/J-W/Wυ strain (4Nakano T.

We have recently reported that the prostanoid pathway of IL-3-developed BMMC could be up-regulated 5-7-fold by stimulation with KL + IL-10 through induction of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGHS)-1, and hematopoietic PGD2 synthase(6Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Google Scholar). However, there was no change in the expression of 5-LO, 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP), or LTC4 synthase(6Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Google Scholar, 7Murakami M. Penrose J.F. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6107-6111Google Scholar), implying previous maximal expression. To establish a selective role for IL-3 in the regulation of the 5-LO/LTC4 synthase pathway it was first necessary to develop a new subclass of BMMC that had not been exposed to this cytokine during their development. We now report that a single growth factor, IL-3, up-regulates each of the proteins involved in the generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes from membrane-derived arachidonic acid in mouse mast cells activated by IgE and antigen. Recombinant mouse KL, IL-3, IL-9, and IL-10 were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and their concentrations were determined as described previously(6Murakami M.

Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 283-289Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells from male BALB/cJ mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were suspended in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning, Corning, NY) at a concentration of 0.5-1 × 106 cells/ml of enriched medium (RPMI 1640 containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml gentamycin, 2 mML-glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal calf serum) supplemented with 100 ng/ml KL and 10 units/ml IL-10. During the first 3 weeks of culture non-adherent cells were pelleted and resuspended in fresh medium once a week at a concentration of 2-5 × 105 cells/ml. After 3 weeks, the non-adherent cells were transferred to a 6-well plate (Corning) at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml and were passaged every 4 days for approximately 2 weeks until the population of cells was >95% BMMC as determined by staining with toluidine blue. These BMMC were then cultured in 25- or 75-cm2 flasks for various periods in the continued presence of 100 ng/ml KL and 10 units/ml IL-10 with or without IL-3; the cells were resuspended in fresh medium at a concentration of 1-2 × 105 cells/ml every 4 days. In an initial dose-response experiment a concentration of 10-100 units/ml IL-3 was found to be optimal for induction of 5-LO, as assessed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting; a concentration of 100 units/ml IL-3 was therefore used in all subsequent experiments. The histamine content of BMMC was measured by radioimmunoassay (Immunotech, Boston, MA). Cytospins of the cultured mast cells were stained with toluidine blue or with Alcian blue and safranin. Measurements of the size of the cells were then made, using a calibrated loop, from photographs taken on a Leica Dialux 20 microscope (Leica Inc., Deerfield, IL) with a ×50 objective. For electron microscopy cell pellets were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde prior to processing. Micrographs were taken on a JEOL 100 CX (JEOL, Peabody, MA) at 80 kV. BMMC were sensitized for 30 min with 10 μg/ml monoclonal IgE anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP) and stimulated for 10 min at 37°C with 100 ng/ml TNP-conjugated bovine serum albumin (TNP-BSA). β-Hexosaminidase, PGD2, and LTC4 release were measured as described previously(6Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted in guanidinium thiocyanate(14Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-537Google Scholar), resolved in 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose, transferred to Immobilon-N (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed as described previously (6Murakami M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Google Scholar) with cDNAs for cPLA2, PGHS-1, PGHS-2, 5-LO, FLAP, and LTC4 synthase that were labeled (Megaprime, Amersham Corp.) with [32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) by random priming. The RNA blots were also probed with a 24-mer oligonucleotide corresponding to a region within the mouse 18 S ribosomal RNA(15Ghildyal N. McNeil H.P. Gurish M.F. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8473-8477Google Scholar). The expression of each protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis(6Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Google Scholar, 8Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Google Scholar). The following concentrations of primary antibodies were used: cPLA2, 1:2,000; PGHS-1, 1:50,000; 5-LO, 1:5,000; FLAP, 1:2,000; and LTC4 synthase, 1:1,000. The immunoblots were visualized with a chemiluminescent ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Corp.). Portions of 2 × 104 BMMC were cultured for 72 h in 100 μl of enriched medium containing various combinations of cytokines in wells of a 96-well plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The following concentrations of cytokines were used: 100 ng/ml KL, 5 ng/ml IL-1β, 100 units/ml IL-3, 1.5 ng/ml IL-4, 100 units/ml IL-5, 5 ng/ml IL-6, 50 units/ml IL-9, 10 units/ml IL-10, 100 units/ml GM-CSF, 500 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF, 500 units/ml tumor necrosis factor α, 100 units/ml interferon-γ, and 5 ng/ml TGF-β1. During the last 8 h of culture, 0.1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) was added to each culture. The radiolabeled nuclei were harvested onto glass filter papers with an automated cell harvester (Tomec, Orange, CT), and their incorporation of radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. It had previously been demonstrated that KL, like IL-3, would generate BMMC but that the purity of these cells was limited and their viability declined with continuing culture(16Gurish M.F. Ghildyal N. McNeil H.P. Austen K.F. Gillis S. Stevens R.L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1003-1012Google Scholar). When bone marrow cells were cultured in KL with IL-10, an accessory growth factor for mast cells(17Thompson-Snipes L. Dhar V. Bond M.W. Mosmann T.R. Moore K.W. Rennick D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 507-510Google Scholar), 65.4 ± 7.8% (mean ± S.E., n = 4) and 84.3 ± 5.5% (n = 4) of the cells were mast cells after 3 and 4 weeks of culture, respectively, as assessed by toluidine blue staining. After 5 weeks of culture, 97.0 ± 2.2% (n = 4) of the cells were mast cells as assessed by metachromatic staining of their granules with toluidine blue (Fig. 1A) and by staining with Alcian blue/safranin (Fig. 1B). BMMC developed in KL + IL-10 contained 1.5 ± 0.5 μg of histamine/106 cells (n = 5), and about half the cells counterstained with safranin (Fig. 1B), indicating heparin biosynthesis. The cells in cytospin preparations were ~15 μm in diameter, with a cross-sectional area of 268 ± 1.0 μm2 (mean ± S.D., n = 33); there was a central or eccentric nucleus, and the cytoplasm contained abundant granules. Electron micrographs revealed that the secretory granules in BMMC developed in KL + IL-10 contained masses of particulate electron dense material and small vesicles (Fig. 1D). Approximately 3-6 × 106such BMMC were developed from 1 × 107 bone marrow cells cultured for 5 weeks in KL + IL-10. The maturity of these BMMC is indicated by their substantial metachromasia with toluidine blue, counterstaining with Alcian blue/safranin (Fig. 1, A and B), content of histamine, and electron density of their granule contents (Fig. 1D). When BMMC developed in KL + IL-10 were sensitized with IgE anti-TNP and activated with TNP-BSA, they exocytosed 40.0 ± 5.4%β-hexosaminidase and generated 8.3 ± 4.5 ng of LTC4/106 cells and 8.1 ± 2.4 ng of PGD2/106 cells (n = 4) (Fig. 2). As compared with BMMC developed from bone marrow with IL-3, those developed with KL + IL-10 responded to IgE-dependent activation with the generation of 2-fold more PGD2 but only one-third the amount of LTC4(6Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Google Scholar). Hence, BMMC developed from bone marrow with KL + IL-10 provided a new class of BMMC in which to seek cytokine up-regulation of the 5-LO pathway. When BMMC developed in KL + IL-10 were cultured for 1 week with 100 units/ml IL-3 in the continued presence of KL and IL-10, the number of cells increased 12.3 ± 2.8-fold compared with an increase of only 1.5 ± 0.4-fold in cells cultured for 1 week more in KL + IL-10 alone (n = 3; p < 0.05). After 2 weeks of culture with IL-3, most of the BMMC contained granules that stained with Alcian blue but did not counterstain with safranin (Fig. 1C). Morphologically the cells nearly doubled in size, the cross-sectional area increasing to 556 ± 3.6 μm2 (mean ± S.D., n = 45), while the size of the nucleus remained constant (Fig. 1C). Electron micrographs revealed that the secretory granules of these cells contained small vesicles (50-80 nm) and sparse electron dense material within clear matrices bound by the granule limiting membrane (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the intense IL-3-driven proliferation favored a less mature phenotype. One week after the addition of IL-3 to BMMC cultured in KL + IL-10, IgE-dependent β-hexosaminidase release doubled to 86.4 ± 11.4% (n = 4) but did not increase further at 4 weeks. IgE-dependent LTC4 generation increased ~15-fold after 1 week of culture with IL-3 and increased ~25-fold to 212.0 ± 35.5 ng/106 cells by 2-4 weeks (n = 4, p < 0.01 versus cells maintained in KL + IL-10 without IL-3) (Fig. 2). In contrast, IgE-dependent PGD2 generation of these cells increased only 3-fold to 25.5 ± 8.6 ng/106 cells after 1-4 weeks of culture with IL-3 (n = 4, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). Thus the ratio of IgE-dependent generation of LTC4 to PGD2 increased from 1.0 to 8.3 in response to treatment with IL-3. In analyzing the basis for this remarkable up-regulation of LTC4 generation, the changes in expression of the four sequentially acting proteins involved in metabolism of arachidonic acid to LTC4 were assessed in terms of steady-state levels of mRNA and expressed protein by RNA blot and SDS-PAGE/immunoblot (Fig. 3), respectively. The initial step in IgE-dependent arachidonic acid metabolism is the liberation of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids by cPLA2(18Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 796-803Google Scholar). cPLA2 protein, which was barely detectable during the first 2 weeks after addition of IL-3 to BMMC cultured concomitantly with KL + IL-10, increased from 3 to 5 weeks (Fig. 3A). The increase in expression of cPLA2 lagged behind the increases in the IgE-dependent generation of LTC4 and PGD2, which were apparent by 1-2 weeks, suggesting that this step did not limit the capacity for eicosanoid generation, perhaps because KL represents an alternative cytokine for expression of cPLA2(6Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Google Scholar). The increased expression of cPLA2 protein was accompanied by only minimal change in cPLA2 transcripts (Fig. 3B), indicating, as in response to KL(6Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Google Scholar), a significant post-transcriptional regulation of its expression. The time course of weeks for IL-3-dependent cPLA2 up-regulation in BMMC developed in KL + IL-10 is unlike the response observed within hours to days in IL-1-stimulated fibroblasts(19Lin L.L. Lin A.Y. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23451-23454Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated HeLa cells(20Hoeck W.G. Ramesha C.S. Chang D.J. Fan N. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evans J.F. Gillard J.W. Miller D.K.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 857-861Google Scholar). IL-3-induced expression of 5-LO protein in BMMC developed with KL + IL-10 was evident within 4 days and increased progressively to reach a plateau by 2-3 weeks with accompanying changes in 5-LO transcripts (Fig. 3). FLAP protein increased in parallel with 5-LO protein over time. Steady-state transcripts for FLAP increased only modestly (Fig. 3), suggesting significant post-transcriptional regulation of FLAP expression. The time course of the up-regulation of the 5-LO and FLAP proteins (Fig. 3A) paralleled that of increased IgE-dependent LTC4 generation (Fig. 2). Up-regulation of 5-LO and/or FLAP has been observed during differentiation of HL60 cells toward granulocytic cells in response to treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide(22Reid G.K. Kargman S. Vickers P.J. Mancini J.A. Leveille C. Ethier D. Miller D.K. Gillard J.W. Dixon R.A. Evans J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19818-19823Google Scholar), during differentiation of human monocytic cells to macrophage-like cells in response to vitamin D3 and TGF-β1 or TGF-β2(23Steinhilber D. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5984-5988Google Scholar), and in human neutrophils stimulated with GM-CSF(24Pouliot M. McDonald P.P. Borgeat P. McColl S.R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1225-1232Google Scholar). That neither GM-CSF (Fig. 4) nor TGF-β (data not shown) altered the expression of the 5-LO pathway in the BMMC developed with KL + IL-10, although GM-CSF is a proliferation cofactor and TGF-β is anti-proliferative, indicates different regulatory cytokines for this pathway within the hematopoietic lineage. LTC4 synthase, also an integral nuclear envelope protein sharing 31% amino acid identity with FLAP(25Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Freeman G.J. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7662-7667Google Scholar), conjugates LTA4 to reduced glutathione to form LTC4. Although LTC4 synthase is induced in U937 cells during differentiation into monocyte/macrophage-like cells in response to treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide (26Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Klemba M.W. Munday N.A. Zamboni R.J. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17849-17857Google Scholar) and in RBL-1 cells treated with retinoic acid (27Hamasaki Y. Abe M. Matsumoto S. Ichimaru T. Kobayashi I. Tanaka E. Matsuo M. Hara N. Miyazaki S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 49-56Google Scholar) as assessed by an increase in enzyme activity, no information exists on the transcriptional or translational regulation of this terminal enzyme. The expression of LTC4 synthase protein, which was detectable only after 4-5 weeks of culture with IL-3, was preceded by a significant increase in steady-state transcripts for this enzyme that was detectable at 1 week (Fig. 3). The plateau in LTC4 biosynthesis at 2 weeks (Fig. 2) implies that the FLAP/5-LO step is more likely than LTC4 synthase to be rate-limiting. None of the other cytokines tested elicited any change in expression of the enzymes of the 5-LO/LTC4 synthase pathway, revealing a strict specificity for IL-3 (Fig. 4). IL-4, IL-9, GM-CSF, and NGF, which acted as accessory cytokines for proliferation as assessed by a 1.5-2.5-fold net increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation similar to that with IL-3 addition in the continued presence of KL + IL-10 (data not shown), were without effect on the 5-LO pathway (Fig. 4). That GM-CSF in combination with KL + IL-10 also did not up-regulate the 5-LO/LTC4 synthase pathway proteins suggests that the selectivity for IL-3 is independent of a common β subunit shared by the receptors for IL-3 and GM-CSF(28Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Google Scholar). Only two cytokines, KL (also known as stem cell factor) and IL-3 (initially termed multi-colony-stimulating factor), are capable of developing mast cell-committed progenitors from bone marrow in vitro and of stimulating their proliferation in the absence of other growth factors. That the initial enzyme of arachidonic acid metabolism, cPLA2, which is shared by the cyclooxygenase and the 5-LO pathways, is regulated by both KL and IL-3 implies the early expression of both routes of eicosanoid biosynthesis in committed mast cell progenitors. KL, a tissue-derived cytokine essential for the development of both mouse mast cell subclasses in vivo(29Kitamura Y. Go S. Blood. 1979; 53: 492-497Google Scholar, 30Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Cho B.C. Donovan P.J. Jenkins N.A. Cosman D. Anderson D. Lyman S.D. Williams D.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 175-183Google Scholar), up-regulates the expression of the enzymes in the cyclooxygenase pathway leading to PGD2 generation in BMMC that were derived in IL-3. IL-10 acts with KL to further up-regulate PGHS-1 with incremental IgE-dependent PGD2 production(6Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3239-3246Google Scholar). IL-3 is implicated in the in vivo development over 2-3 weeks of helminthic infection of MMC that predominantly generate cysteinyl leukotrienes(31Abe T. Sugaya H. Ishida K. Khan W.I. Tasdemir I. Yoshimura K. Immunology. 1993; 80: 116-121Google Scholar). When BMMC are initially developed from bone marrow cells with KL + IL-10 and then treated with IL-3, the major up-regulation of eicosanoid metabolism occurs in the cysteinyl leukotriene generating 5-LO pathway (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Irrespective of whether or not these in vitro findings are directly related to in vivo tissue-specific mast cell phenotypes, these studies reveal that the early acting cytokines, KL and IL-3, respectively, up-regulate each protein in separate pathways for prostanoid and cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis in committed mast cell progenitors We thank C.

Differences between the Nod factors mainly concern the length of the oligomer (three to five glucosamine residues in USDA257 and five residues only in NGR234) and the presence of additional substituents in NGR234 (N-linked methyl, one or two carbamoyl groups on the non-reducing moiety, acetyl or sulfate groups on the fucose).

Mutation of nodU in NGR234 suppresses the formation of bis-carbamoylated species. Insertional mutagenesis of nodSU drastically decreases Nod factor production, but with the exception of sulfated factors (which are partially N-methylated and mono-carbamoylated), they are identical to those of the wild-type strain.

Doc-1 is an evolutionarily conserved gene exhibiting loss of heterozygosity and marked reduction in expression in malignant hamster oral keratinocytes. The full-length doc-1 cDNA encodes an 87 amino acid product that shows a significant homology to one of the seven novel genes induced in mouse fibroblasts by TNF-α. Transfection of the full-length doc-1 cDNA into malignant hamster oral keratinocytes alters the behavior of the recipients in terms of morphology, growth rate, and anchorage-independent growth, suggesting reversion of transformation phenotypes.

https://openalex.org/W2106760961,"MOLT-4 cells, a human lymphocytic leukemia line, undergo apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli, including exposure to ionizing radiation. Very little is known of the molecular mechanisms by which radiation induces apoptosis. Morphology changes and chromatin cleavage at in- ternucleosomal sites accompany apoptosis in these cells. We found that trolox, a water-soluble deriva-tive of vitamin E that penetrates biomembranes and protects mammalian cells from oxidative damage, blocks DNA fragmentation in irradiated MOLT-4 cells. Levels of DNA fragmentation in cells not treated with trolox were directly related to both radiation dose and time postirradiation. Preincuba-tion of cells with trolox or incubation with trolox only during irradiation did not protect cells. A 4 h postirradiation incubation with trolox was sufficient to completely block fragmentation measured at 24 h, indicating the processes triggered by radiation to induce DNA fragmentation occur early after irradia-tion. Removal of cells from trolox earlier than 4 h resulted in progressively less inhibition. Trolox pre-serves the integrity of irradiated cells as judged by increased viability and thymidine incorporation. Ra-diation induces an uptake of extracellular Ca2+ into MOLT-4 cells that was blocked by a postirradiation incubation with trolox. These results suggest that membrane-associated oxidations triggered by radiation are responsible for radiation-induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells.—McClain, D. E., Kalinich, J. F., Ramakrishnan, N.

A water molecule can apparently form a hydrogen bond bridge between the β abasic site and A17. Damage to DNA bases can arise from a number of naturally occurring routes including oxidative stress as well as by the action of various chemical agents and by radiative processes. Base damage such as the spontaneous deamination of cytosine to form uracil, the oxidation of thymine to thymine glycol, or the oxidation of guanine to 8-oxo guanine can be repaired via abasic sites. The first step in repair in vivo is often the hydrolytic cleavage of the modified base, at the C-N bond between the sugar and the damaged or unusual base to generate an abasic site. The cleavage of the glycosidic bonds is catalyzed by DNA glycosylases which were first identified in 1974(1Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Google Scholar), and there are nine known distinct classes of glycosylases(2Lindahl T. Nature. 1994; 362: 709-715Google Scholar, 3Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev.

Uracil glycosylase is the most familiar of the glycosylases and catalyzes the reaction shown below. Structures of two uracil glycosylases have been recently determined (6Mol C.D. Arvai A.S.

The abasic site is not a chemically unique species but is an equilibrium mixture of four forms(8Manoharan M. Ransom S.C. Mazumder A. Gerlt J.A. Wilde J.A. Withka J.M. Bolton P.H. J. Am. Chem.

Cunningham R.P. Withka J.M. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1119-1126Google Scholar). The abasic site is an equilibrium mixture of α- (I), and β- (II) hemiacetals (2-deoxy-D-erythro-pentofuranoses), of aldehyde (III), and of hydrated aldehyde (IV), as depicted below. The hemiacetal forms predominate with about 1% aldehyde being present(8Manoharan M. Ransom S.C. Mazumder A. Gerlt J.A. Wilde J.A. Withka J.M. Bolton P.H. J. Am. Chem.

The number of abasic sites in a “typical” human cell is not known as the rate of formation and the rate of repair are dependent on many factors. Ames and co-workers (19Cathcart R. Schniers E. Saul R.L. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5633-5637Google Scholar) have estimated that there are more than 10,000 damaged sites/typical human cell at any given time.

The damage of mitochondrial DNA can also lead to cancer, and the repair processes of mitochondria are not well understood(24Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Google Scholar). During the past few years there has been a growing appreciation of the diversity of DNA repair responses depending on the state of the cell. DNA repair can be highly coupled with transcription(25Leadon S. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23175-23182Google Scholar). Thus, in mature cells damaged DNA sites can accumulate, and the structural and dynamical effects of damaged DNA and the intermediates in DNA repair may be more important in mature than in dividing cells. It is now known that DNA repair can be strand specific with only the transcribed strand being repaired(2Lindahl T. Nature. 1994; 362: 709-715Google Scholar, 3Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev.

Sarasin A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 981-984Google Scholar). When DNA polymerase copies DNA containing an abasic site there is a strong preference, about 90%, for dA to be put in the daughter strand in the position opposite the abasic site(2Lindahl T.

Minton K. J. Virol. 1975; 16: 315-321Google Scholar). There may be special features associated with dA interacting with the abasic site with these physical properties determining to the dA preference which occurs during the rate determining step in the polymerase reaction. On the other hand if the various bases have similar interactions with the abasic site in the context of duplex DNA then the preference for dA is most likely that of the replication complex(22Ide H. Murayama H. Murakami A. Morii A. Makino K. Nucleic Acid Symp. Series. 1992; 27: 167-168Google Scholar). There is no consensus at the present time for the origin of this preference, and there is some evidence that it is due to a kinetic effect (40Cai H. Bloom L.B. Eritja R. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23567-23572Google Scholar) suggesting that the conformation of the abasic site may be important. Abasic sites also affect transcription. The limited results to date suggest that the presence of an abasic site slows down but does not block transcription(21Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6605Google Scholar, 22Ide H. Murayama H. Murakami A. Morii A. Makino K. Nucleic Acid Symp. Series. 1992; 27: 167-168Google Scholar, 26Selby C.P. Sancar A.

The base most commonly placed in the RNA at the position complementary to the abasic site is rA. This is the same preference as found for DNA polymerases and suggests that the dA/rA preference might be at least partially due to the preferential interaction of A with the abasic site. There have been a number of studies of DNA duplexes containing analogues of the naturally occurring abasic site(43Cuniasse P. Sowers L.C. Eritja R. Kaplan B. Goodman M.F. Cognet J.A. LeBret M. Guschlbauer W. Fazakerley G.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8003-8022Google Scholar, 44Cuniasse P. Fazakerley G.V. Guschlbauer W. Kaplan B.E. Sowers L.C. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3373-3383Google Scholar). These tetrahydrofuran or other analogues differ from the natural abasic site in hydrogen bonding potential, chemical reactivity, and perhaps other properties as well. The hydrogen bonding potential may be important since it is likely that the abasic site interacts with water molecules. A recent investigation indicated that the conformational preferences of at least some of these abasic site analogues are different from those of aldehydic abasic sites(47Serianni A.S. Kline P.C. Snyder J.R. J Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5886-5887Google Scholar). Studies on abasic sites are also of interest as they relate to studies on DNA degradation by drugs such as bleomycin and neocarzinostatin(15Goldberg I.H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 41-54Google Scholar, 48Kozarich J.W. Worth Jr., L. Frank B.L. Christner D.F. Vanderwall D.E. Stubbe J. Science. 1989; 245: 1396-1399Google Scholar, 49Kappen L.S. Goldberg I.H.

These drugs lead to products such as deoxyribolactones and other types of non-aldehydic abasic. The refined solution state structures of duplex DNAs containing abasic sites may be useful for comparison with those generated by anti-tumor and other drugs. The DNA single strands d(C1G2C3G4A5U6A7C8G9C10C11) and d(G22C21G20C19T8A17T16G15C14G13G12) were obtained from DNAgency and the purity of the single strands checked by reverse phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopyNOEnuclear Overhauser effectECOSYeasy correlation spectroscopyPECOSYphased easy correlation spectroscpyheterotocysheteronuclear total correlation spectroscopy. on a preparative Hamilton PRP-1 column via elution with a gradient of 1.5-8.5% acetonitrile in 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in 22.5 min.

The abasic site single strand d(C1G2C3G4A5D6A7C8G9C10C11) was prepared by treating DNA with the single strand d(C1G2C3G4A5U6A7C8G9C10C11) that contains a single U residue, with N-uracil glycosylase as described previously(8Manoharan M.

Soc. 1988; 110: 2690-2692Google Scholar). The extent of reaction was monitored during the reaction by the reverse phase HPLC method described above which separates free uracil, the DNA single strand containing U, and the DNA single strand containing the abasic site. The single strand containing the abasic site was purified by gel filtration chromatography on a preparative TSK-GEL G2000SW column and eluted with 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 100 mM sodium chloride at pH 7.0 to remove N-uracil glycosylase and free uracil. The purified single strand was subsequently dialyzed, lyophilized to dryness, and dissolved in pH 7.0 buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 0.05 mM EDTA in 99.96%2H2O. Abasic site containing single-stranded DNA prepared by this approach was found to be pure both by proton and 31P NMR and to be free of phosphodiester cleavage products. Overall yield for the conversion of the single-stranded material to abasic site containing DNA was about 85%. Due to the degradation of DNA containing abasic sites at elevated temperatures with subsequent irreversibility of duplex formation, a precise melting temperature for the duplex was not determined. The heteroduplexes were formed by mixing equimolar quantities based on the extinction coefficients of the two strands and by monitoring the titration of the single strand containing the residue dU or D with the adjacent strand. The duplex was lyophilized several times in 2H2O and dissolved in 0.4 ml of 99.96%2H2O. The purified duplex was studied at 1-1.5 mM concentration in pH 7.0 buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, and 0.05 mM EDTA in 99.96%2H2O. For one-dimensional NMR experiments involving the exchangeable imino protons, the duplex was lyophilized and dissolved in 90% H2O, 10%2H2O. The 400 MHz NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Unityplus spectrometer, and the 500 and 600 MHz NMR spectra were obtained using Bruker AMX spectrometers at the University of Wisconsin. The proton spectrum of this DNA was previously assigned (51Goljer I. Withka J.M. Kao J.Y. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11614-11619Google Scholar). The Varian NMR results were processed using VNMR software, and FELIX 2.1 software was used for the Bruker data. The two-dimensional NOESY, ROESY, double quantum filter correlation spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, PECOSY, and other NMR experiment were carried out in the usual fashion. Heteronuclear 31P-1H correlation data were obtained using the Unityplus 400 via a two-dimensional PHH-heterotocsy experiment(52Wang K.Y. Goljer I. Bolton P.H. J. Magn. Reson. Series B. 1994; 103: 192-196Google Scholar). The heteronuclear spinlock time was 100 ms. The spectral width in the 1H dimension was 2232 Hz collected into 1664 points and in the 31P dimension was 500 Hz collected into 128 complex points. 128 scans for each of the 128 t1 increments were obtained with an acquisition time of 0.4 s. The data were zero-filled to 2K data points in F2 and 1K data points in F1 dimension. The data were weighed with a Gaussian apodization in each dimension. NOESY experiments in 2H2O were carried out at mixing times of 100 and 200 ms with a 1.6 s equilibration delay with presaturation of the water resonance, using the Bruker 500 MHz with a spectral width 5000 Hz in each dimension. At each mixing time, 512 t1 increments were acquired with 64 scans for each increment. The F1 dimension was zero filled to 2K, and the data were weighed with a Gaussian apodization in each dimension prior to 2K × 2K Fourier transformation. These data were used for quantification of the NOESY cross-peaks. A NOESY spectrum was obtained with a 300-ms mixing time using the Varian Unityplus 400 spectrometer at 20°C in 2H2O with 31P decoupling during the evolution time. The data were collected into 2K complex points in t2 and 1K complex points in t1 with a spectral width of 4000 Hz in each dimension, and 64 transients were acquired for each of 512 increments of t1. A Gaussian weighting was used in both dimensions, and the spectra were zero-filled to 4096 by 4096 real points. The heteronuclear JPH couplings were determined by comparison of the proton linewidth along F1 and F2. NOESY experiments in 90% H2O, 10%2H2O were carried out on the Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer with jump and return pulses replacing the last 90° pulse in the standard NOESY sequence. The delay between the jump and return pulses was 55 ms. 650 increments of t1 with 96 scans/increment were used, and 4K data points in t2 were acquired. The spectral width in each dimension was 12,000 Hz. The data was processed to minimize the intensity of the water signal of each FID prior first Fourier transformation in the F2 dimension. Gaussian apodization was used in both dimensions, the data was zero-filled to 4K data points in t1, and a second order polynomial base-line correction was used for the F2 dimension. PECOSY spectra were collected at 400 MHz, and the data were collected into 2K complex points in t2 and 512 complex points in t1. The spectral width in F2 was 3200 Hz, and in F1 2600 Hz. 256 transients were acquired for each increment in t1. The data was linear predicted to 360 points before zero filling, and Gaussian weighting was used in both dimensions and the spectra were zero-filled to 4K × 4K real points. One-dimensional 31P NMR spectra were obtained at 161.9 MHz with proton decoupling. The spectral width was 2687 Hz with 4288 complex points and 128 scans. A Lorentzian apodization of 3 Hz was applied prior to Fourier transformation. One-dimensional spectra of the imino protons were obtained at 400 MHz with spectral width of 10,000 Hz using a jump and return pulse for water suppression and 8K of complex points. The standard solvent subtraction was used prior to Fourier transformation. The volumes in the NOE cross-peaks of the data obtained with 100 and 200 ms mixing times were quantified using FELIX 2.1 software. For each assigned and resolved cross-peak, the volume in a standard area was determined. Structure refinement was performed as described elsewhere (53Young M.A. Goljer I. Kumar S. Srinivasan J. Beveridge D.L. Bolton P.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 121-144Google Scholar) by restrained molecular dynamics using X-PLOR 3.1 with the following modifications. The structure of the AD duplex was refined using a complete relaxation matrix restrained molecular dynamics trajectory using X-PLOR 3.1 as described elsewhere (53Young M.A. Goljer I. Kumar S. Srinivasan J. Beveridge D.L. Bolton P.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 121-144Google Scholar). The experimental NOE cross-peak volumes were used as constraints using a well function. The experimental homonuclear and heteronuclear couplings were used to generate dihedral constraints defining sugar pucker and the conformation of the backbone using a harmonic potential. In addition, dihedral constraints were used to keep the purine rings planar. The non-bonded interaction cut off was set to 11.5 Å. The distance over which the switching functions for non-bonded interaction was switched from on to off was 9.5-10.5 Å. The distance cut off for the 28 Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding interactions was set to 7.5 Å, and the switching function was applied from 4.0 to 6.5 Å. 219 NOE volume constraints were used for each of the two mixing times. 16 H1′-H2′ dihedral constraints were used in addition to 13 P-O-H3′ dihdedral constraints. NOE constraints for the imino protons of base pairs 4, 5, 7, and 8 were used. The NOE and other constraints are available at the ftp site. The optimum relative weighting of the NOE constraint, 40 kcal/mol, was found to be larger for the abasic site DNA than for undamaged DNAs, 20 kcal/mol. In addition, the optimum weighting of the biharmonic potential for the heavy atoms involved in experimentally observed base pair hydrogen bonds was found to be 30 rather than the 20 kcal/mol found for undamaged DNA. The other force constants were the same as used for undamaged DNA(53Young M.A. Goljer I. Kumar S. Srinivasan J. Beveridge D.L. Bolton P.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 121-144Google Scholar). The X-PLOR force field has been optimized for normal duplex DNA. The presence of the abasic site eliminates both stacking and steric interactions between the bases found in undamaged DNA and which are built into the X-POLR force field. The increase in the relative weighting of the experimental constraints compensates for the differences of the abasic site DNA. The starting structures were generated from a canonical B-DNA by replacing the base with a hydroxyl group at the C1′α- or β-position of the abasic site. This hydroxyl group has a partial negative charge of −0.325. The structures of the α and β structures were refined separately. The energy of each of the starting structures was minimized in 100 steps of Powell's conjugate gradient minimization using X-PLOR. The relaxation matrix refinements were carried out in vacuum at 300°K. These were further minimized using the force field with all restraints for 100 steps of minimization and then subjected to a 100 ps relaxation matrix simulation followed by 200 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization. Each trajectory was run for a total of 100 ps, and the structures appeared to reach equilibrium after about 20 ps. There were no significant differences between the structures after 20 ps and those after 100 ps. The structures at 20 ps were used for generating the back calculated spectra. Coordinates of both structures are available at the ftp site. The NOE cross-peak volumes for each of these structures were back-calculated separately using an overall correlation time of 5 ns, a leakage rate of 0.33 s-1 and a distance cutoff of 5.5 Å. The spectra calculated for each of the structures were added together for comparison with the experimental results. An anonymous ftp site has been set up that contains the assignments, NOE and dihedral constraints, and the structures of the α and β forms of the DNA. This site can be accessed either by http://prophet.chem.wesleyan.edu/Chemistry.html using a web browser and following the links papers-bolton-ABASICSITEJBC1995. Alternatively the ftp site can be accessed at ftp://prophet.chem.wesleyan.edu with the material in the/pub/papers/bolton/ABASICSITEJBC1995 directory. The imino proton spectrum of the duplex is shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum indicates that the resonances in the AT region are broadened due to exchange. The integration of the AT region corresponds to less than two base pairs. The GC iminos are similar to those of the parent duplex with the broad resonance at 12.5 parts/million being from a terminal base pair. The proton-decoupled 31P spectrum of the duplex is also shown in Fig. 1. The resonances all appear in the region associated with B-form DNA, and there is relatively low resolution in the spectrum. Two resonances appear slightly downfield from the others. The most downfield resonance is from the phosphate between residues 16 and 17. Analogous downfield resonances have been previously observed from DNA duplexes containing abasic sites. The one-dimensional proton spectrum of the non-exchangeable protons of the DNA are shown in Fig. 1. This spectrum was used to demonstrate that a one to one complex was formed by comparison with the spectra of the two individual strands that were combined to form the duplex. The assignments of the protons of the DNA were made using the standard connectivities of B-form DNA. Fig. 2 contains the NOE connectivities of the aromatic and H1′ protons as well as the connectivities of the aromatic and H2′,H2″ and methyl protons. Most of the interresidue connections are indicated in Fig. 2. In the β configuration of the abasic site, the H1′ and H2″ protons are spatially close and in the α configuration the H1′ and H2′ protons are spatially close. These NOEs were observed and allowed the assignment of the H1′, H2′, and H2″ resonances of the α and β forms of the abasic site. The assignments of the proton resonances and the assignments of the analogous duplex which does not contain an abasic site are available at the ftp site. NOEs involving the abasic site include those between A7H8 and D6H1′ (α), A5H2 and D6H1′(α), A7H8 and D6H2′, D6H2″ (β) as indicated in Fig. 2. The NMR results are consistent with our prior observations (8Manoharan M. Ransom S.C. Mazumder A. Gerlt J.A. Wilde J.A. Withka J.M. Bolton P.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 1620-1622Google Scholar, 11Wilde J.A. Bolton P.H. Manoharan M. Ransom S.C. Gerlt J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1894-1895Google Scholar) of essentially equal amounts of the α and β forms. The NOEs involving the imino protons are shown in Fig. 3. A strong NOE is observed between A5H2 and the imino proton of T18. This indicates that A5-T18 is a good base pair and that it is A7-T16 which is disrupted by the presence of the abasic site. The NOE connectivities of the imino protons of the G residues involved in base pairs are those of B-form DNA. The qualitative analysis of the NOE and other results indicates that the presence of the abasic site at position disrupts the A7-T16 base pair but not the A5-T18 base pair. The NOEs indicate that the structure of the DNA duplex in the region near the abasic site depends on whether the abasic site is in the α or β configuration since distinctly different NOEs are observed for the two forms. The results also indicate that the structure of the duplex DNA is quite similar to that of the analogous duplex at the base pairs more than one removed from the abasic site. The NMR results were used to obtain refined structures for duplex DNA containing an abasic site by separately refining the structures and comparing the results predicted by each structure with the experimental results. The experimental results are actually the combination of the results from the α and β forms so the results predicted by each form were combined and compared with the experimental data. Fig. 4 contains the NOE cross-peaks in the aromatic to H1′ region for the refined α structure, the refined β structure, and the combination of the α and β structures, and the experimental spectrum is shown for comparison. The differences between the predicted spectra of the α and β forms are highlighted in this figure. In this spectral region two of the main differences between the α and β forms are the A7H2-D6H1′ and the A5H8-G4H1′ cross-peaks which are only found in the predicted spectrum of the α form. Fig. 5 contains the cross-peaks of the aromatic to H2′/H2“methyl region for the refined α structure, the refined β structure, and the combination of the α and β structures, and the experimental spectrum is shown for comparison. The differences between the predicted spectra of the α and β forms are highlighted in this figure. In this spectral region, the A7H8-H2′ and A7H8-H2′ are only predicted by the β form structure, and the A17H8-T18 methyl cross-peak is only predicted for the α form structure. The two forms also differ in their predictions of some of the NOEs of the terminal residues. These results show that the NOE spectra back calculated from neither the α or β form offer good agreement with the NOEs observed from the protons of the abasic site while the sum of the two back calculated spectra account for the NOEs of the abasic site. This is in accord with both forms being present in solution. The two refined structures are shown in Fig. 6 with the minor groove prominent and Fig. 7 with the major groove prominent. The structure of the β form is much more “B-like” in the region near the abasic site than is the α form. In both cases A5-T18 is a good base pair while A7-T16 is not. In the α form the abasic site sugar is almost extrahelical and residues 5 and 7 are relatively close together. In the β form the spacing between the aromatic rings of residues 5 and 7 is comparable to that of B-form DNA. Thus, it appears that when the abasic site in the β form that the structural distortion induced by the abasic site is minimal whereas in the α form there is a considerable distortion induced by the presence of the abasic site. Fig. 8 shows the overlay of structures consistent with the NMR data for the α and β forms.Figure 7:The structures of the α and β forms of the DNA are shown with the major groove prominent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8:The structures obtained during the 80-100 ps time intervals of the trajectories used for determining the structures of the α and β forms of the duplex DNA containing the abasic site. The structures obtained at points equally spaced in time are overlaid for each of the two trajectories.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A rationale for this difference can be ascribed to the hydrogen bonding potential of the abasic site. In the β form D6 and A17 can be bridged by an intervening water molecule which hydrogen bonds to both as depicted in Fig. 9. The position of the water molecule was found by minimizing the energy of the water molecule while keeping the DNA fixed. The water molecule can form a bifurcated hydrogen bond to the OH and ribose ring oxygen of D6 as well as a regular hydrogen bond to the N1 of A17. The analogous hydrogen bonding is less likely to occur for the α form since positioning the 1'OH of D6 would be accompanied by unfavorable steric interactions of the abasic site sugar with the ring of A7. The abasic site will be able to be the donor in hydrogen bonds to the ring nitrogen of dA and dC residues and the acceptor in hydrogen bonds to the imino protons of dG and dT residues. The hydrogen bonding interactions of the abasic site are likely to be important in determining the differences in the properties of DNA duplexes with different bases opposite the abasic site. The interaction of the α and β abasic sites with DNA polymerase and other enzymes may be different due to their different hydrogen bonding capabilities. Additional studies to determine the structures of DNA duplexes with residues other than dA opposite the abasic site are underway. The 500 and 600 MHz spectra were obtained with the assistance of Dr. Frits Abildgaard using at the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison."

The presence of a large folded domain in heme lyases was utilized to study their folding in the intermembrane space. Formation of this domain occurred at the same rate as import, indicating that heme lyases fold either during or immediately after their transfer across the membrane. Folding was not affected by depletion of ATP and Δψ or by inhibitors of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases, i.e. it does not involve homologs of known folding factors (like Hsp60 and Hsp70). The energy derived from folding cannot be regarded as a major driving force for import, since the folded domain could be imported into mitochondria with the same efficiency as the intact protein.

https://openalex.org/W2050859640,"The expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which plays a crucial role in tissue remodeling by controlling the synthesis of the broadly acting plasmin serine protease, is regulated by several tyrosine kinases. Since the actions of these tyrosine kinases is dependent on the activation of ras proteins, we undertook a study to identify signaling events downstream of ras responsible for the stimulation of urokinase promoter activity. Transient expression of an activated c-Ha-ras in OVCAR-3 cells, which do not harbor the mutated oncogene, led to a dose-dependent trans-activation of the urokinase promoter. A sequence residing between −2109 and −1964 was critical for the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by c-Ha-ras. Mutation of an AP-1 and a PEA3 site at −1967 and −1973, respectively, or the co-expression of a transactivation domain-lacking c-jun substantially impaired the ability of c-Ha-ras to stimulate urokinase promoter activity. The induction of the urokinase promoter by ras was completely blocked by expression of a dominant negative c-raf expression vector and substantially reduced in cells made to co-express a catalytically inactive mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. Further, the expression of an ERK1/ERK2-inactivating phosphatase (CL100) abrogated the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by c-Ha-ras. These data argue for a role of a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling pathway in the regulation of urokinase promoter activity by ras. The expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which plays a crucial role in tissue remodeling by controlling the synthesis of the broadly acting plasmin serine protease, is regulated by several tyrosine kinases. Since the actions of these tyrosine kinases is dependent on the activation of ras proteins, we undertook a study to identify signaling events downstream of ras responsible for the stimulation of urokinase promoter activity. Transient expression of an activated c-Ha-ras in OVCAR-3 cells, which do not harbor the mutated oncogene, led to a dose-dependent trans-activation of the urokinase promoter. A sequence residing between −2109 and −1964 was critical for the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by c-Ha-ras. Mutation of an AP-1 and a PEA3 site at −1967 and −1973, respectively, or the co-expression of a transactivation domain-lacking c-jun substantially impaired the ability of c-Ha-ras to stimulate urokinase promoter activity. The induction of the urokinase promoter by ras was completely blocked by expression of a dominant negative c-raf expression vector and substantially reduced in cells made to co-express a catalytically inactive mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. Further, the expression of an ERK1/ERK2-inactivating phosphatase (CL100) abrogated the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by c-Ha-ras. These data argue for a role of a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent signaling pathway in the regulation of urokinase promoter activity by ras. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator has been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes including prostatic involution, cytotrophoblast implantation, and tumor cell invasion, all of which require extensive extracellular matrix proteolysis(1Strickland S. Reich E. Sherman M.I. Cell. 1976; 9: 231-240Google Scholar, 2Andreasen P. Kristensen P. Lund L.R. Dano K. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2567-2576Google Scholar, 3Tryggvason K. Hoyhtya M. Salo T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 907: 191-217Google Scholar). Urokinase facilitates this process by mediating the conversion of the abundant zymogen, plasminogen, into the widely acting serine protease plasmin, the latter which degrades several extracellular matrix components including laminin, fibronectin, and possibly type IV collagen(4Liotta L. Goldfarb R. Brundage R. Siegel G. Terranova V. Garbisa S. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 4629-4636Google Scholar, 5Salo T. Liotta L. Keski-Oja J. Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T. Tryggvason K. Int. J. Cancer. 1982; 30: 669-673Google Scholar). Transcription of the urokinase gene gives rise to a 2.5-kilobase mRNA(6Verde P. Stoppelli M.P. Galeffi P. Di Nocera P. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4727-4731Google Scholar), which is subsequently translated into a single chain ⋍ 50-kDa proenzyme (7Kasai S. Arimura H. Nishida M. Suyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12382-12389Google Scholar, 8Nielsen L. Hansen J. Skriver L. Wilson E. Kaltoft K. Zeuthen J. Dano K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6410-6415Google Scholar) and secreted into the extracellular space. The steady state level of urokinase mRNA is determined at two levels. Firstly, the expression of the gene is regulated by 2.1 kilobases of the 5′-flanking sequence(9Verde P. Boast S. Franze A. Robbiati F. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10699-10715Google Scholar). Secondly, recent studies have indicated that 3′-untranslated sequences play a role in determining the stability of the urokinase mRNA(10Nanbu R. Menoud P. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 14: 4920-4928Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that urokinase expression is regulated by growth factors (HGF/SF, EGF), 1The abbreviations used are: HGF/SFhepatocyte growth factor/scatter factorEGFepidermal growth factorMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMAPKK (MEK)mitogen-activated protein kinase kinaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasebpbase pair(s)TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. which bind to transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinases, and by non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases including v-src and v-yes(11Pepper M.S. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Orei L. Montesano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20493-20496Google Scholar, 12Grimaldi G. Di Fiore P. Locatelli E.K. Falco J. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 855-861Google Scholar, 13Bell S.M. Connoly D.C. Maihle N.J. Degen J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5888-5897Google Scholar). One of the early events in this pathway involves the coupling of the ligand-activated receptor protein tyrosine kinase to ras through Grb2.sos or Shc Grb2.sos, this increasing the exchange of GTP for GDP and culminating in an activated ras(14Graziani A. Gramaglia D. dalla Zonca P. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9165-9168Google Scholar, 15Sasaoka T. Langlois W.J. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 32621-32625Google Scholar). The pivotal role of ras in mediating the signal generated by tyrosine kinases has been deduced from several experimental observations. First and foremost, inhibitory ras mutant proteins (16Stacey D.W. Roudebush M. Day R. Mosser S.D. Gibbs J.B. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2297-2304Google Scholar) block the stimulation of growth and transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Secondly, revertant clones isolated from activated ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells are resistant to retransformation by protein tyrosine kinase-encoding oncogenes(17Kuzumaki N. Ggiso Y. Oda A. Fujita H. Suzuki H. Sato C. Mullauer L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2258-2263Google Scholar). Thirdly, ras, like protein tyrosine kinases, elevates urokinase mRNA levels in chick embryo fibroblasts(13Bell S.M. Connoly D.C. Maihle N.J. Degen J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5888-5897Google Scholar). hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor epidermal growth factor mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase base pair(s) 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. However, the events connecting the ras signal to altered gene expression are still not entirely clear. Certainly, the involvement of c-raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK also referred to as MEK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), which form successive tiers in a ras-dependent signal transduction pathway, has been suggested from several reports. c-raf is a protein serine/threonine kinase which acts as a cytoplasmic signal transducer downstream of ras(18Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Google Scholar) and is an immediate upstream activator of MAPKK (MEK1)(19Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-420Google Scholar, 20Huang W. Alessandrini A. Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10947-10951Google Scholar). MEK1, in turn, activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) group of MAPK (21Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Google Scholar) which regulates AP-1 activity via increased transcription of the c-fos gene (22Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Google Scholar) as a consequence of p62tcf/elk phosphorylation. Alternatively, modulation of gene expression by ras can also be achieved in a c-raf-independent pathway involving the c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK)(23Hibi M. Lin A. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar, 24Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1722Google Scholar). Although ras increases the steady state level of urokinase mRNA(13Bell S.M. Connoly D.C. Maihle N.J. Degen J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5888-5897Google Scholar), the mechanism by which this is accomplished has not been elucidated. We therefore undertook a study to determine the role of a MAPK pathway in the regulation of urokinase expression by c-Ha-ras. We report, herein, that the stimulation of urokinase promoter activity by ras, is dependent on one, or multiple, MAPKs and is mediated via the stimulation of an AP-1 and PEA3 sequence located at −1967 and −1973, respectively, as well as a region residing between −1956 and −1905 in the urokinase promoter. The 6.6-kilobase BamHI fragment from the activated c-Ha-rasEJ oncogene from the T24 bladder carcinoma cells cloned in a pSV2neo plasmid (25Nicolson G.L. Gallick G.E. Dulski K. Spohn W.H. Lembo T.M. Tainsky M.A. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 747-753Google Scholar) was used for ras transfections. The TAM 67 vector, encoding a c-jun protein lacking the transactivation domain (amino acids 3-122 absent) of the molecule, has been described elsewhere(26Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886Google Scholar, 27Domann F.E. Levy J.P. Birrer M.J. Bowden G.T. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 9-16Google Scholar). The CL100 expression vector (CL100 SG5), kindly provided by S. M. Keyse, University of Dundee, United Kingdom, contains the CL100 cDNA (encoding residues 1-314) of the CL100 protein (28Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Google Scholar) fused at the carboxyl terminus to sequences encoding a single copy of the myc epitope tag EQKLISEEDL and ligated into a pSG5 vector (Stratagene). The K97M mutant expression vector encodes a catalytically inactive MEK1 in which a methionine is substituted for a lysine in the ATP binding site(29Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukusawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Google Scholar, 30Al-Alawi N. Rose D.W. Buckmaster C. Ahn N. Rapp U. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1162-1168Google Scholar). The c-raf C4 expression vector encodes c-raf lacking the conserved regions 2 and 3 and therefore lacks the kinase domain contained in the latter(18Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Google Scholar). The 3 × AP-1 pBLCAT construct consists of 3 AP-1 tandem repeats upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter-CAT reporter (pBLCAT)(31Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Google Scholar). The mutated urokinase promoter CAT reporter constructs have been described elsewhere(32Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Google Scholar). The OVCAR-3 cell line was derived from a malignant ascites of a patient with progressive adenocarcinoma of the ovary(33Hamilton T.C. Young R.C. McKoy W.M. Grotzinger K.R. Green J.A. Chu E.W. Whang-Peng J. Rogan A.M. Green W.R. Ozols R.F. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 5379-5389Google Scholar). Codons 12, 13, and 61 of c-Ha-ras are not mutated in the OVCAR-3 cells. 2G. Mills, personal communication. All cells were maintained in McCoy's medium 5A supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the collection of conditioned medium, cells were plated in the presence of serum-containing medium and 24 h later changed to serum-free medium (McCoy's medium 5A supplemented with 4 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml of insulin, and 10 ng/ml EGF). Conditioned medium was collected 24 h later, and cells were counted. The amount of urokinase in the conditioned medium was determined by Western blotting. Briefly, conditioned medium from equal numbers of cells was denatured in the absence of reducing agent and electrophoresed in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated sequentially with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to human urokinase (product 389, American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT). Reactive proteins were visualized by ECL as described by the manufacturer (Amersham). OVCAR-3 cells were transfected by a calcium phosphate method with CAT reporter constructs fused to the wild type (2109 bp), mutated, or 5′-deleted fragments of the human urokinase promoter (9Verde P. Boast S. Franze A. Robbiati F. Blasi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10699-10715Google Scholar, 32Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Google Scholar) without, or with, the c-Ha-ras expression vector. All transient transfections were performed in the presence of 5 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector to correct for differences in transfection efficiencies. Briefly, DNA precipitate formed in the presence of 124 mM calcium chloride in a buffer containing 15 mM Hepes (pH 7.1), 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4 was added to 50% confluent OVCAR-3 cells. After 6 h, the cells were changed to fresh 10% fetal bovine serum-containing medium and cultured for an additional 36 h. The cells were harvested and lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles in a buffer containing 0.25 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.8). Transfection efficiencies were determined by assaying for β-galactosidase activity. CAT activity was measured by incubating cell lysate (normalized for transfection efficiency) at 37°C for 6-8 h with 4 μM [14C]chloramphenicol and 1 mg/ml acetyl coenzyme A. After 3 h, the acetyl coenzyme A was replenished. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, and acetylated products were subjected to thin layer chromatography using chloroform:methanol (95:5) as a mobile phase. The amount of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was determined using a 603 Betascope. The OVCAR-3 cell line, which does not contain an activated ras, secretes an undetectable level of urokinase, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1). We therefore elected to use the OVCAR-3 cells to study the inductive effect of ras on urokinase promoter activity. Transient expression of c-Ha-ras in OVCAR-3 cells led to a dose-dependent increase in urokinase promoter activity (Fig. 2). Addition of 4 μg of c-Ha-ras caused a 10-fold stimulation of urokinase promoter activity whereas 50 ng of the oncogene increased CAT activity three times. The induction of the urokinase promoter by ras could not be accounted for by a vector effect since 4 μg of the pSV2neo expression vector did not elevate CAT activity over that achieved without the oncogene.Figure 2:Transient expression of c-Ha-ras increases urokinase promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. OVCAR-3 cells were transiently transfected at 50% confluency with 10 μg of a CAT reporter driven by the wild type (2109 bp) urokinase promoter in the absence, or in the presence, of varying amounts of a vector bearing the c-Ha-ras sequence or 4 μg of the vector alone (pSV2neo). All transfections were performed in the presence of 5 μg of a β-galactosidase-expressing vector. After 5 h, the medium was changed and cells were cultured for an additional 36 h. The cells were harvested and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Cell extracts, corrected for differences in transfection efficiency, were incubated with [14C]chloramphenicol for 8 h. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and subjected to thin layer chromatography. The conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to acetylated derivatives was determined with a 603 Betascope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the region of the urokinase promoter required for its stimulation by ras, we co-transfected OVCAR-3 cells with a CAT reporter driven by 5′ deletion fragments of the urokinase promoter and the ras expression vector (Fig. 3). A dramatic stimulation of the urokinase promoter was evident with 2109 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence. This stimulation was almost entirely abolished when the CAT reporter was fused to 1964 or to 1870 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence. These data suggest that a sequence residing between −2109 and −1964 is critical for the stimulation by the ras oncogene. The region of the urokinase promoter residing between −2109 and −1964 contains binding sites for AP-1 and PEA3 shown to be required for the stimulation of several inducible genes (34Pankov R. Umezawa A. Maki R. Der C. Hauser C.A. Oshima R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 873-877Google Scholar, 35Nerlov C. Rorth P. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1583-1593Google Scholar). Mutation of the AP-1 binding site at −1967 (mutant B) resulted in a dramatic reduction in the ability of ras to stimulate the urokinase promoter (Fig. 4). Likewise, mutation of a PEA3 (mutant A) motif at −1973 also impaired the ability of ras to stimulate the urokinase promoter, and this may be related to the observations that c-ets family members play a key role in the regulation of gene expression by ras(36Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921Google Scholar, 37Wasylyk C. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673Google Scholar). Mutation of two regions of the urokinase promoter (mutant I and F) shown to be required for the maximal stimulation by phorbol ester (32Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Google Scholar) reduced the stimulation by ras between 40 and 60%. In contrast, an AP-1 sequence residing at −1885 did not appear to be critical for the stimulation by ras since [14C]chloramphenicol conversion was unchanged when this site was mutated (mutant G). The observation that mutation of an AP-1 binding site could diminish the stimulation of the urokinase promoter activity by ras suggested the involvement of transcription factors which bind to this site. To further address this possibility, we transiently transfected OVCAR-3 cells with the urokinase promoter-driven CAT reporter and ras with, or without, an expression vector bearing a c-jun mutant (TAM 67). This c-jun mutant lacks amino acids 3-122 and is unable to transactivate AP-1-containing genes (26Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886Google Scholar, 27Domann F.E. Levy J.P. Birrer M.J. Bowden G.T. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 9-16Google Scholar). The mutant protein inhibits AP-1-mediated processes through a quenching mechanism by inhibiting the function of endogenous fos and/or jun proteins(26Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886Google Scholar). Lysates of OVCAR-3 cells transfected with the urokinase promoter-CAT reporter, the c-Ha-ras expression vector, and the empty TAM 67 vector (cytomegalovirus vector) resulted in 92% [14C]chloramphenicol conversion up from 2% in the absence of ras (Fig. 5). In contrast, expression of 1 and 10 μg of the c-jun mutant attenuated the ability of ras to stimulate the urokinase promoter (Fig. 5). Thus, conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol was reduced to 29% in cells co-transfected with 10 μg of the c-jun mutant. These data suggest that AP-1-binding transcription factors are necessary for the ras-mediated stimulation of the urokinase promoter. The inability of the c-jun mutant to repress the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by ras to the same extent as the urokinase promoter mutated at the AP-1 binding site (at −1967-mutant B) (Fig. 4) may very well reflect an incomplete quenching brought about by expression of the TAM 67 construct. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the activity and/or synthesis of a number of transcription factors including fos and c-ets family members is modulated by MAPKs including ERK1 and ERK2(22Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Google Scholar, 38O'Neill E.M. Rebay I. Tjian R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 137-147Google Scholar). Since our data suggest that transcription factors, which bind to the AP-1 and PEA3 sequences in the urokinase promoter, are important for the induction by ras, we examined the role of these MAPKs in the stimulation of urokinase promoter activity by the oncogene. Toward this end, we used an expression vector which contains the human CL100 cDNA(28Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Google Scholar). This encodes a dual specificity (Tyr/Thr) protein phosphatase which inactivates both ERK1 and ERK2(39Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020Google Scholar). The ability of CL100 to inactivate both ERK1 and ERK2 is of importance to these studies since the simultaneous block of both of these MAPKs is necessary to abrogate the stimulation of AP-1 by phorbol ester and by ras(40Frost J.A. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3844-3848Google Scholar). Expression of the vector encoding the CL100 phosphatase completely abrogated the stimulation of urokinase promoter activity by c-Ha-ras (Fig. 6A) whereas the vector lacking the coding sequence of CL100 (pSG5) had only a minimal effect on this stimulation. Since AP-1-binding transcription factors are required for the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by ras, we determined whether the expression of CL100 could also repress the induction of an AP-1-driven promoter by ras. OVCAR-3 cells were transiently transfected with a CAT reporter driven by 3 AP-1 tandem repeats (3 × AP-1 pBLCAT) upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter (pBLCAT) and the ras expression vector with, or without, the CL100-encoding expression vector. Expression of ras caused a marked stimulation of the AP-1-driven CAT reporter (Fig. 6B) in OVCAR-3 cells, whereas the activity of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter-CAT reporter (pBLCAT), which was negligible, was unaffected by the oncogene. Co-expression of the CL100-encoding vector (CL100 SG5) countered the ras-dependent induction of the AP-1-driven CAT reporter. The highest level of the CL100-encoding vector (10 μg), but not the empty vector (pSG5), completely abolished the stimulation of the AP-1-driven CAT reporter by ras. Although the CL100-encoding vector also repressed the basal activity of the 3 × AP-1 pBLCAT vector, the amount of this repression was insufficient to account for the MAPK phosphatase-mediated suppression of the ras response. These data indicate that the induction of AP-1 activity by ras, which is critical for the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by the oncogene, is effectively countered by co-expression of a MAPK-inactivating phosphatase. The ability of a MAPK-inactivating phosphatase (CL100) to counter the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by ras was consistent with the notion of ERK involvement. However, since there are conflicting reports concerning the specificity of this MAPK-inactivating phosphatase toward the ERK-subgroup of MAPKs(41Sun H. Tonks N. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Google Scholar, 42Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Google Scholar), we asked whether the expression of a functionally inactive upstream activator of ERKs (29Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukusawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Google Scholar) would abrogate the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by ras. MEK1 is a specific activator of the ERKs(21Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Google Scholar, 43Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I. Han J. Ulevitch J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar), and we made use of a mutant MEK1 expression vector (MEK K97M) in which a methionine is substituted for a lysine at the ATP binding site of the enzyme rendering it catalytically inactive(29Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukusawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Google Scholar, 30Al-Alawi N. Rose D.W. Buckmaster C. Ahn N. Rapp U. Meinkoth J. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1162-1168Google Scholar). We transiently transfected (Fig. 7) OVCAR-3 cells with the urokinase promoter-driven CAT reporter and ras in the presence of an expression vector encoding the MEK K97M mutant. The stimulation of the urokinase promoter by the oncogene ([14C]chloramphenicol acetylation increased from 4 to 17%) was almost entirely abrogated by co-expression of the catalytically inactive MAPKK (6% [14C]chloramphenicol conversion was evident with 10 μg of the MEK K97M). In contrast, expression of the wild type MAPKK (MEK wt) had little effect on either the basal or the ras-dependent activation of the urokinase promoter activity. The inability of the wild type MAPKK to stimulate the basal activity of the urokinase-driven CAT reporter (i.e. in the absence of ras) in the OVCAR-3 cells is consistent with a report by Mansour et al.(29Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukusawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Google Scholar) showing that this expression vector does not activate an AP-1-driven CAT reporter nor does it transform NIH 3T3 cells. These data indicate that a MAPKK, which functions as an ERK activator, is necessary (but possibly by itself insufficient) for the regulation of urokinase promoter activity by ras. Since c-raf is an upstream activator of MAPKK(19Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-420Google Scholar, 20Huang W. Alessandrini A.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8212-8218Google Scholar), we then determined the sensitivity of urokinase expression to a dominant negative c-raf expression vector. OVCAR-3 cells were transiently transfected with the urokinase promoter-driven CAT reporter and the ras expression vector in the presence of increasing amounts of a dominant negative c-raf expression vector (raf C4). This vector encodes the amino-terminal 257 amino acids of c-raf(18Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Google Scholar) and is therefore kinase-deficient. Expression of the raf C4 led to a dose-dependent reduction in the ability of the ras expression vector to stimulate the urokinase promoter (Fig. 8). Thus, while a conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol of 43% was apparent in OVCAR-3 cells transiently transfected with ras and the urokinase promoter-CAT reporter, this was reduced to 7% in the presence of 0.1 μg of the dominant negative raf C4 expression vector. In contrast, the empty vector lacking the c-raf coding sequence failed to repress the induction of the CAT reporter by ras. Although the raf C4 expression vector also reduced the basal activity of the urokinase promoter (i.e. in the absence of ras), the magnitude of this response could not account for the reduction observed in the presence of the activated oncogene. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the activation of the urokinase promoter by ras in the OVCAR-3 cells is dependent on c-raf. However, since the mutant protein encoded by the raf C4 expression vector binds to the effector domain of ras(45Warne P.H. Rodriguez Viciana P. Downward J. Nature. 1993; 364: 352-355Google Scholar), we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the raf C4 dominant negative vector is functioning in the OVCAR-3 cells by interfering in the activation of ras effectors other than c-raf. Urokinase gene expression is regulated by a diverse set of growth factors which interact with transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases including HGF/SF and EGF as well as by non-membrane tyrosine kinases including v-src(11Pepper M.S. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Orei L. Montesano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20493-20496Google Scholar, 12Grimaldi G. Di Fiore P. Locatelli E.K. Falco J. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 855-861Google Scholar, 13Bell S.M. Connoly D.C. Maihle N.J. Degen J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5888-5897Google Scholar). Although there is ample evidence that these tyrosine kinases mediate their effects via ras-dependent pathways(16Stacey D.W. Roudebush M. Day R. Mosser S.D. Gibbs J.B. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2297-2304Google Scholar), the downstream event(s) by which ras stimulates urokinase gene expression has not been determined, and it now appears that ras can stimulate at least 2 distinct pathways, one which is c-raf-dependent, the other c-raf-independent(24Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1722Google Scholar). Stimulation of the c-raf-dependent pathway by ras leads to the sequential activation of MAPKK and the ERK group of the MAPKs (19Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-420Google Scholar, 20Huang W. Alessandrini A. Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10947-10951Google Scholar, 21Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Google Scholar). The ERKs phosphorylate several transcription factors including p62tcf/elk, this leading to increased AP-1 activity as a consequence of enhanced fos gene transcription (22Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Google Scholar). Several observations in this, and other, studies suggest that the induction of urokinase promoter activity by ras occurs through this pathway. Firstly, expression of the ERK1/ERK2-inactivating CL100 phosphatase efficiently blocked the ras signal in OVCAR-3 cells. Secondly, an expression construct encoding a catalytically inactive MEK1, which is specific for the ERKs, substantially reduced the ability of ras to stimulate the urokinase promoter. Thirdly, the block of c-raf, which is an upstream effector of MEK1(19Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-420Google Scholar, 44Jelinek T. Catling A.D. Reuter C.W.M. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8212-8218Google Scholar), with a dominant negative expression vector, completely abrogated the ras-dependent stimulation of the urokinase promoter. Thus, together these data would suggest a pivotal role for one, or multiple, ERKs in the stimulation of the urokinase promoter by ras and are consistent with the hypothesis that this is achieved by the c-raf-dependent pathway described by Minden et al.(24Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1722Google Scholar). Additionally, since dominant negative mutants to ERK1 and ERK2 also block AP-1 activation (an event necessary for the induction of the urokinase promoter by ras) as well as the proliferation response to growth factors including EGF(40Frost J.A. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3844-3848Google Scholar, 46Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Google Scholar), it may very well be that the ability of these stimuli to elevate urokinase expression (47Rorth P. Nerlov C. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5009-5017Google Scholar) is mediated through this pathway. Further evidence that the regulation of urokinase expression by ras is mediated through a c-raf-dependent pathway comes from studies with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. TPA, via protein kinase C, is an activator of c-raf(48Sozeri O. Vollmer K. Liyanage M. Frith D. Kour G. Mark G.E. Stabel S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2259-2262Google Scholar), and treatment of cells with this agent leads to a strong activation of urokinase gene transcription(49Stoppelli P. Verde P. Grimaldi G. Locatelli E. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1235-1241Google Scholar). The transcriptional requirements for urokinase promoter stimulation by TPA (32Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Google Scholar) and ras are similar in that mutation of the PEA3 and AP-1 motifs (−1973 and −1967, respectively), as well as a region shown to be required for the efficient induction of urokinase gene expression by the phorbol ester (32Nerlov C. De Cesare D. Pergola F. Caracciolo A. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Verde P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4573-4582Google Scholar), substantially impaired the ability of the oncogene as well as TPA to stimulate the promoter. Presumably, these findings for ras reflect the well characterized observations of increased AP-1 and PEA3 activity brought about by the oncogene as a consequence of increased synthesis, or activation by phosphorylation, of c-jun, c-fos, and c-ets family members (50Imler J.L. Schatz C. Wasylyk C. Chatton B. Wasylyk B. Nature. 1988; 332: 275-278Google Scholar, 51Sistonen L. Holtta E. Makela T.P. Keski-Oja J. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 815-822Google Scholar). While these data suggest the involvement of ERKs in the regulation of urokinase expression by ras, we cannot currently exclude a role for the JNKs in this process. ras, via MEKK, is an inducer of JNK(24Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1722Google Scholar), and this leads to increased AP-1 activity subsequent to c-jun phosphorylation(23Hibi M. Lin A. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar). However, any speculation as to the role of JNKs in the regulation of urokinase expression by ras must take into account our observations that interfering with the ERK pathway with a MEK1 mutant, or with a dominant negative c-raf expression vector, effectively suppresses the ras stimulus. Thus, either the JNKs play only a minor role in the regulation of urokinase expression by the oncogene or alternatively both ERKs and JNKs are concurrently required for the stimulation of urokinase promoter activity by ras. Notwithstanding these considerations, our findings favor a key role for the ERKs in the stimulation of urokinase promoter by ras. In conclusion, we have shown that the induction of urokinase promoter activity by an activated c-Ha-ras requires a PEA3/AP-1 sequence in the urokinase promoter and is mediated through a c-raf and MAPK-dependent signal transduction pathway. Since several tyrosine kinases including the receptors for EGF (c-erbB1), and HGF/SF (p190met), as well as the non-receptor tyrosine kinase v-src, mediate their effects through ras, it is interesting to speculate that c-raf and/or the MAPKs may represent novel therapeutic targets for repressing the elevated synthesis of the plasminogen activator in invasive cancer which is driven by both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms We are grateful to Drs.

The significance of the isolated structures is discussed in relation to the biological functions and the biosynthetic mechanisms of heparin. INTRODUCTIONHeparin exerts a variety of biological activities such as inhibition of blood coagulation (Marcum and Rosenberg, 1989), modulation of cellular proliferation (Clowes and Karnovsky, 1977; Thornton et al., 1983), potentiation of angiogenesis (Folkman and Ingber, 1989), and interactions with acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (Maciag et al., 1984; Shing et al., 1984; Klagsbrun and Shing, 1985). Some of these activities seem to reside within the complex fine structure of heparin. It is generally accepted that heparin expresses most of these activities by mimicking in vitro the physiological activities of heparan sulfate through its structure, similar to that of heparan sulfate. However, the structure-function relationships of heparin/heparan sulfate are not fully understood.The basic polymeric common structure of heparin and heparan sulfate is an alternating repeat sequence of →4GlcAβ/IdoAα1→4GlcNα1→, 1The abbreviations used are: GlcAD-glucuronic acidTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyNOEnuclear Overhauser enhancementNOESYNOE spectroscopyMLEVMalcom LevittHexAhexuronic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyΔHexA4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid or 4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acidIdoAL-iduronic acidGlcND-glucosamineΔDiHS-0SΔ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcNAcΔDiHS-6SΔ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcNAc(6-sulfate)ΔDiHS-NSΔ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcN(N-sulfate)ΔDiHS-diS1Δ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcN(N, 6-disulfate)ΔDiHS-diS2Δ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-4)GlcN(N-sulfate)ΔDiHS-triSΔ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-4)GlcN(N, 6-disulfate), NS, N-sulfate2S2-O-sulfate3S3-O-sulfate6S6-O-sulfate. which can be variably sulfated (for reviews see Rodén(1980), Gallagher and Lyon(1989), and Lindahl(1989)). Heparin contains more sulfate and IdoA but less N-acetyl groups and GlcA as compared with heparan sulfate. Sulfate groups can be located at C-2 of hexuronic acid and C-2, C-3, and/or C-6 of glucosamine residue and add the structural complexity to the carbohydrate backbone to form various active domain structures responsible for a number of biological activities. Recent structural studies of the binding domains to antithrombin III (for review see Lindahl(1989)) and basic fibroblast growth factor (Habuchi et al., 1992; Turnbull et al., 1992; Tyrrell et al., 1993; Maccarana et al., 1993) are the best known examples showing the relationships between the fine structure and biological functions.Heparin and heparan sulfate are synthesized on the specific serine residues of the core polypeptides through the unique carbohydrate-protein linkage region, −3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser, which is also shared by chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. It has not been clarified yet how these glycosaminoglycans diverge in biosynthesis into different structures from the same trisaccharide sequence. The biosynthetic sorting mechanism of glucosaminoglycans (heparin/heparan sulfate) and galactosaminoglycans (chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate) has been an enigma. Although unique modifications by phosphorylation and sulfation of the linkage trisaccharide sequence have been demonstrated (Oegema et al., 1988; Fransson et al., 1985; Sugahara et al., 1988, 1991, 1992b; de Waard et al., 1992), no evidence has been presented for the involvement of these modifications in the biosynthetic sorting mechanism. The importance of the amino acids near the heparan sulfate attachment site has also been pointed out (Zhang and Esko, 1994), but whether peptide sequences are the primary determinants for heparan sulfate synthesis remains to be determined. Differences between biosynthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate are not well understood either. Although they share a number of common structural features, there are several structural differences. Heparan sulfate has a long nonsulfated sequence consisting of at least eight repeating units (−4GlcAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-)8 in the vicinity of the linkage region (For review see Gallagher and Lyon(1989); Lyon et al.(1994)), whereas heparin has a shorter nonsulfated sequence and appears to be modified by sulfation near the linkage region (For review see Lindahl(1989); Rosenfeld and Danishefsky(1988); Sugahara et al. (1992a)). However, the exact modified structure of this region of a heparin chain has not been investigated in detail yet.We have been analyzing the structure of the carbohydrate-protein linkage region of various sulfated glycosaminoglycans to investigate the structure-function relationships and the biosynthetic mechanisms of these glycosaminoglycans (Sugahara et al., 1988, 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1994, 1995; de Waard et al., 1992). Previously we isolated two glycoserines, ΔHexAα1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser (glycoserine I) and ΔHexAα1-4GlcNAc(6S)α1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser (glycoserine II) from the linkage region of heparin after exhaustive digestion with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinases I and II (Sugahara et al., 1992a). In the present study we isolated and characterized larger glycoserines and glycopeptides after digestion with only heparinase in order to investigate the structure beyond the above tetra- and hexasaccharide sequences.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsStage 14 heparin was purchased from American Diagnostica (New York) and purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography as previously reported (Sugahara et al., 1992a), and the preparation should have been devoid of heparan sulfate. Cellulofine gels, heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7), and purified heparitinases I (EC 4.2.2.8) and II (no EC number) were obtained from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo. Δ4,5-Glycuronate-2-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.-), abbreviated as 2-sulfatase, was purified from Flavobacterium heparinum (McLean et al., 1984). Six standard unsaturated disaccharides were prepared from heparin as previously reported (Yamada et al., 1992).Fragmentation of Heparin and Size Fractionation of the FragmentsThe purified heparin (140 mg) was digested by 5 IU of heparinase in a total volume of 10 ml of 30 mM acetate-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 3 mM Ca(OAc)2 and 1% bovine serum albumin. When the reaction reached a plateau after 7 h as monitored by absorption at 232 nm, it was terminated by heating at 100°C for 2 min. The digest was adjusted to 0.2 M NaCl and fractionated on a column (3 × 96 cm) of Cellulofine GCL-90-m equilibrated with 0.2 M NaCl. Elution was performed with the same solution at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. Fractions (7.5 ml) were collected and monitored by absorption at 232 nm. Eluates were separated into fractions a-d as shown in Fig. 1. The separated fractions were concentrated, desalted by gel filtration on a column (0.8 × 58 cm) of Cellulofine GCL-25-m, and lyophilized.HPLC and Capillary ElectrophoresisFractionation and analysis of unsaturated oligosaccharides were carried out by HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column using a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min basically as described previously (Sugahara et al., 1992b). Eluates were monitored by absorption at 232 nm. The separated fractions were concentrated and desalted through a column of Sephadex G-25. Capillary electrophoresis was carried out to examine the purity of each isolated fraction using a fused silica capillary in a Waters capillary ion analyzer (Sugahara et al., 1994). A new capillary (60 cm total length, 75 μm internal diameter; Millipore Corp.) was activated by sequential washes with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide, distilled water, and 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 3.0, before use. The electrophoretic fractions were detected by absorption at 185 nm caused by OH groups, since that of the test compounds (the linkage hexasaccharide alditols) was at least 5-fold higher than that obtained at 232 nm. Samples (1 nmol/10 μl), prepared in distilled water, were injected using hydrostatic pressure to give a total volume of 24 nl of an injected solution. The electrophoresis was performed using constant voltage of 15 kV for a period of 20 min. Negative polarity power supply was used.Quantification of the Linkage Region GlycoserinesThe content of the linkage region in fractions a-d was quantified by exhaustive digestion with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinases I and II followed by determination of the resultant glycoserine I by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column as described previously (Sugahara et al., 1992a). The glycoserine II content was below the detection limit of HPLC; the molar ratio of glycoserines I and II in the heparin preparation used was 96:4 (Sugahara et al., 1992a).Digestion of Fraction b-10 with 2-Sulfatase and Subfractionation of the DigestFraction b-−10 (120 nmol) was incubated with 60 mIU of 2-sulfatase in a total volume of 150 μl of 6.7 mM CH3COONa, pH 6.5, containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 1 min, and the digest was fractionated by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. Otherwise the HPLC conditions were the same as described above.Digestion of the Isolated Oligosaccharides with Heparinase, Heparitinases, or 2-SulfataseOligosaccharides (0.5 nmol) were digested using 2 mIU of heparinase at 37°C for 20 min in a total volume of 40 μl of 100 mM acetate-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 3 mM Ca(OAc)2. For exhaustive heparitinase I digestion, an incubation was conducted using 2.4 mIU of the enzyme and 0.3 nmol of each substrate at 37°C for 150 min in a total volume of 30 μl of 20 mM acetate-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mM Ca(OAc)2. For partial heparitinase I digestion, an incubation was carried out using 1 mIU of the enzyme and 0.5 nmol of an oligosaccharide at 37°C for 5 (for fraction b-5) or 60 min (for fraction b-6) in a total volume of 50 μl of the buffer described above. Heparitinase II digestion was performed using 0.5 mIU of the enzyme and 0.5 nmol of a substrate at 37°C for 20 min in a total volume of 50 μl of the buffer described above for heparitinase I. 2-Sulfatase digestion was carried out using 5 mIU of the enzyme and 1.0 nmol of a substrate at 37°C for 60 min in a total volume of 65 μl of the buffer described above for 2-sulfatase. Enzymatic reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min, and the digests were analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column as reported (Sugahara et al., 1992b).1H NMR SpectroscopyOligosaccharides for NMR analysis were fully sodiated by cation-exchange chromatography through a column of Dowex 50-X8 (Na+ form) (7 × 18 mm) and then repeatedly exchanged in 2H2O with intermediate lyophilization.NMR spectra of fractions b-5 and b-6 were recorded on a Bruker AMX-500 or AMX-600 spectrometer (Department of NMR spectroscopy, Utrecht University) operated at a probe temperature of 292, 295, or 300 K. One-dimensional spectra and a double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy spectrum of fraction b-5 were recorded as described previously (Piantini et al., 1982; Derome and Williamson, 1990; Hård et al., 1992). Two-dimensional NOESY experiments were performed with a mixing time of 150-200 ms (Jeener et al., 1979). Two-dimensional TOCSY spectra were recorded using a clean-MLEV-17 spin-lock pulse sequence of 100 ms, preceded by a 2.5-ms trim-pulse (Braunschweiler and Ernst, 1983; Bax and Davis, 1985; Griesinger et al., 1988). In all two-dimensional experiments the HO2H resonance was presaturated during the relaxation delay and additionally during the NOE-mixing time in NOESY-experiments. Phase-sensitive detection was achieved by the time-proportional phase increment method (Marion and Wüthrich, 1983). Two-dimensional spectra were recorded with 300-512 t1 experiments, and 80-160 free induction decays of 2048 or 4096 data points were collected per t1 increment. Data sets were processed using the Bruker UXNMR software package. In short, time domain data were zero-filled, multiplied by a phase-shifted sine bell function, and after Fourier transformation base line-corrected with fifth order polynomal fits.NMR spectra of fraction b-10S-II were recorded on a Varian VXR-500 spectrometer (Kobe Pharmaceutical University) at a probe temperature of 299 K as previously reported (Yamada et al., 1992).Other Analytical MethodsUronic acid was determined by the carbazole method (Bitter and Muir, 1962). Unsaturated uronic acid was spectrophotometrically quantified based upon an average millimolar absorption coefficient of 5.5 at 232 nm (Yamagata et al., 1968). Amino acids and amino sugars were quantified after acid hydrolysis in 6 M HCl at 110°C for 20 h and 3 M HCl at 100°C for 16 h, respectively, using a Beckman 6300E amino acid analyzer (Sugahara et al., 1987).RESULTSIsolation of the Linkage GlycoserinesHeparinase specifically cleaves the glucosaminide linkage in -GlcN(NS)α1-4IdoA(2S)- (Linker and Hovingh, 1984; Linhardt et al., 1990; Yamada et al., 1994), and heparinase-resistant structures containing a few or several N-acetylglucosamine residues have been claimed to occur in the vicinity of the linkage region (Lindahl, 1966; Rosenfeld and Danishefsky, 1988). Therefore, to isolate linkage region fragments larger than the previously isolated glycoserines I and II, stage 14 heparin purified from porcine intestine, which contains Ser as the predominant amino acid (Lindahl and Rodén, 1972), was exhaustively digested with heparinase only. A heparinase digest was fractionated by gel filtration into fractions a-d as indicated in Fig. 1. The recoveries of serine in fractions a, b, c, and d were 67, 24, 2, and 1%, respectively, of that contained in the starting heparin. Fractions c and d mainly contained tetra- and disaccharides, respectively, which were derived from the repeating disaccharide region as characterized by HPLC (data not shown). The oligo- or polysaccharides attached to serines or peptides were recovered in fractions a and b. The amounts of the linkage region structure in fractions a and b were quantified by exhaustive digestion with a mixture of heparin lyases followed by HPLC analysis, which demonstrated (per 100 mg of heparin) 1.67 and 0.60 μmol of glycoserine I in fractions a and b, respectively. They represented 91 and 93% of Ser in the fractions a and b, respectively. Glycoserine II was not detected and seems to be below the detection limit. Fraction a contained dermatan sulfate as a contaminant, which was revealed by the GalN content accounting for approximately 5% (w/w) of the purified heparin preparation. Trials of obtaining appreciable amounts of linkage oligosaccharides from fraction a by HPLC have been unsuccessful. Low recoveries were probably due to strong retention of larger sulfated oligosaccharides on the HPLC column. In this study we demonstrated four linkage structures in fraction b.Fraction b was subfractionated by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column, and peaks were designated fractions b-1 to b-26 as shown in Fig. 2. Nine major fractions, 5, 6, 10, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, and 24, were purified by rechromatography, and the amino acid analysis was performed for each fraction. Based upon the detected serine, approximately 41, 12, and 28% of the linkage region in fraction b was recovered in fractions b-5, −6, and −10, which accounted for 3.6, 1.1, and 2.7% of the applied ΔHexA, respectively. Preparative HPLC yielded 239, 71, and 166 nmol (as Ser) of fractions b-5, −6, and −10, respectively, per 100 mg of the purified heparin. No appreciable amount of serine was recovered in the other peaks, most of which contained unsaturated hexasaccharides derived from the repeating disaccharide region as judged from the ratio of uronic acid and GlcN to ΔHexA. Structural studies of these hexasaccharides are in progress.Figure 2:Subfractionation of fraction b by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. Oligosaccharide fraction b obtained by gel filtration was subfractionated into fractions b-1 to b-26 on an amine-bound silica column using a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 from 0.2 to 1.0 M over 90 min. Fractions b-5, b-6, and b-10, which contained Ser, are marked by asterisks. Fraction b-10 was digested by 2-sulfatase, and the digest, designated fraction b-10S, was separated into three subfractions, b-10S-I, −II, and −III, by HPLC as shown in the inset using the same conditions. The elution position of the parent fraction b-10 is indicated by an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The separated fractions b-5, −6, and −10 gave a single symmetrical peak upon HPLC. In the preliminary experiments their sensitivity to 2-sulfatase was examined to evaluate their purity and structural characteristics. 2-Sulfatase acts only on the 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid 2-sulfate structure at the nonreducing end of a saccharide chain (McLean et al., 1984). Fractions b-5, −6, and −10 were all sensitive to the enzyme, as expected from the linkage specificity of heparinase (see above), indicating that the major compound in each fraction has a sulfate group at the C-2 position of the ΔHexA (not shown). After 2-sulfatase digestion, fractions b-5 and −6 gave a single peak, which eluted approximately 10 min earlier than the corresponding parent compound on HPLC (not shown), supporting the homogeneity of fractions b-5 and b-6. In contrast, a 2-sulfatase digest of fraction b-10, designated fraction b-10S, gave three peaks, fractions b-10S-I, −II and −III, in a molar ratio of 21:58:21, which eluted approximately 8 min earlier than the parent fraction (Fig. 2, inset), indicating that fraction b-10 was a mixture of at least three components. Since it was not possible to resolve fraction b-10 into its subcomponents preparatively, it was first digested with 2-sulfatase, and then the digest was fractionated by HPLC. The major peak b-10S-II, the yield of which was about 90 nmol from 100 mg of the starting heparin, was isolated and subjected to structural analysis. Fractions 10S-I and −III were not analyzed due to their limited amounts.Characterization of Fraction b-5Capillary electrophoresis resolved fraction b-5 into two fractions, b-5-II and b-5-I, in a molar ratio of 1.0:2.2 (Fig. 3A), indicating that it contains at least two components. However, it was not separable on a large scale into each component and was therefore analyzed without further purification.Figure 3:Capillary electrophoresis of the isolated linkage region fractions. Fraction b-5 (A), b-6 (B) or b-10S-II (C) was subjected to electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The peak at around 4 min is presumably due to a non-carbohydrate contaminant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As shown in Table 1, chemical analysis showed that fraction b-5 contained ΔHexA, HexA, GlcN, Ser, and Gly in a molar ratio of 1.00:1.73:1.96:1.11:0.93. The disaccharide analysis of fraction b-5, carried out by exhaustive heparitinase I digestion followed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column, gave rise to equimolar amounts of ΔDiHS-0S, ΔDiHS-triS, and a component that eluted shortly before ΔDiHS-0S, corresponding to glycoserine I derived from the carbohydrate-protein linkage region of heparin (Sugahara et al., 1992a) (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that fraction b-5 most likely contained two isomeric octasaccharide-peptides, each of which was composed of 1 mol each of the nonsulfated and the trisulfated disaccharide units and HexA1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser (Gly).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 4:HPLC analysis of the enzyme digests of fraction b-5. Fraction b-5 was digested by heparitinase I (panel B) or by heparitinase II alone (panel C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The digest was subjected to HPLC on an amine-bound silica column using a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 from 16 to 530 mM over 60 min. Elution positions of the standard disaccharides isolated from heparin/heparan sulfate are indicated in panel A. 1, ΔDiHS-0S; 2, ΔDiHS-6S; 3, ΔDiHS-NS; 4, ΔDiHS-diS1; 5, ΔDiHS-diS2; 6, ΔDiHS-triS. Glycoserine I is the tetrasaccharide-serine ΔHexAα1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser reported previously (Sugahara et al., 1992a). The peak marked by an asterisk at around 35 min is often observed upon high sensitivity analysis and is due to an unknown substance eluted from the column resin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Heparitinase II digestion of fraction b-5 yielded equimolar amounts of two components, namely ΔDiHS-triS and a component that eluted near the elution position of the nonsulfated hexasaccharide, ΔHexAα1-4GlcNAcα1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl, derived from the carbohydrate-protein linkage region of bovine kidney heparan sulfate (Sugahara et al., 1994) (Fig. 4C). The results are summarized in Table 2 and are consistent with the previous observation that the hexasaccharide structure is resistant to heparitinase II (Fig. 5) (Sugahara et al., 1994). Together the above results indicate that the two components in fraction b-5 share the common structure, ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4HexA1-4GlcNAcα1-4HexA1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser(Gly) with only a subtle difference between them.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 5:Specificities of heparitinases I and II.

(1992a), and see “Discussion”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Characterization of Fraction b-6Fraction b-6 gave a single peak on HPLC (not shown) and is more than 85% pure as judged by capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 3B). Chemical analysis showed that fraction b-6 contained ΔHexA, HexA, GlcN, and Ser in a molar ratio of 1.00:3.17:2.46:1.13 (Table 1). The disaccharide analysis of fraction b-6 was performed by heparitinase I digestion followed by HPLC. Exhaustive heparitinase I digestion gave rise to three unsaturated components, ΔDiHS-0S, ΔDiHS-triS and glycoserine I, in a molar ratio of 2:1:1, based upon peak areas (Table 2). The results indicate that fraction b-6 contains a decasaccharide-serine composed of 2 mol of the nonsulfated disaccharide units, 1 mol each of the trisulfated disaccharide unit and glycoserine I.Heparitinase II digestion of fraction b-6 produced mainly two components (Table 2), ΔDiHS-triS and one that eluted approximately 6 min later than ΔHexAα1-4GlcNAcα1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl derived from heparan sulfate (Sugahara et al., 1994), and which therefore was assumed to be a nonsulfated octasaccharide-serine ΔHexAα1-4GlcNAcα1-4HexA1-4GlcNAcα1-4HexA1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser. When exhaustively digested using 6 times the amount of enzyme used under the standard conditions, fraction b-6 gave rise to equimolar amounts of ΔDiHS-0S, ΔDiHS-triS, and a presumably nonsulfated hexasaccharide-serine (data not shown). These results indicate that the major compound in fraction b-6 is a trisulfated decasaccharide-serine ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4HexA1-4GlcNAcα1-4HexA1-4GlcNAcα1-4HexA1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser.Characterization of Fraction b-10S-IIFraction b-10S-II gave a single symmetrical peak both on HPLC (data not shown) and on capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 3C), indicating its homogeneity. Chemical analysis showed that fraction b-10S-II contained ΔHexA, HexA, GlcN, and Ser in a molar ratio of 1.00:1.91:2.38:1.40 (Table 1). Upon HPLC analysis of the heparitinase I digest of fraction b-10S-II, three major UV-absorbing peaks of glycoserine I, ΔDiHS-6S, and ΔDiHS-diS1 were observed in a molar ratio of 1.00:0.96:1.02 with a few minor peaks (Table 2), indicating that the major compound in fraction b-10S-II was a trisulfated octasaccharide-serine composed of equimolar amounts of the above three components.When digested with heparitinase II, this compound yielded equimolar amounts of ΔDiHS-diS1 and the component eluted at the position of glycoserine II (Sugahara et al., 1992a) (Table 2), indicating that the disulfated disaccharide unit, ΔDiHS-diS1, was located at the nonreducing terminus. Thus, the structure of the compound in fraction b-10S-II is ΔHexAα1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4HexA1-4GlcNAc(6S)α1-4HexA1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser.1H NMR SpectroscopyThe structures in fractions b-5 and b-6 were determined using one- and two-dimensional 1H correlation spectroscopy, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra. The anomeric region of the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 6A) of fraction b-5 shows two sets of signals differing in intensity, reflecting the presence of two compounds in an approximately 2:1 ratio. Resonances stemming from the protons of the core monosaccharide residues Xyl-1, Gal-2, Gal-3, and GlcA-4 were readily assigned by their characteristic TOCSY patterns on the H-1 tracks (Fig. 7A), and the close resemblance of their chemical shifts with those of the common core region GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser (Table 3) (van Halbeek et al., 1982). The presence of this partial structure is corroborated by NOEs between GlcA-4 H-1 and Gal-3 H-3, between Gal-3 H-1 and Gal-2 H-3, and between Gal-2 H-1 and Xyl-1 H-4 (Fig. 7B). The presence of a single series of proton resonances stemming from this partial structure indicates that both compounds contain this common core region. Almost identical sets of signals are observed for the terminal ΔHexA residue (Fig. 6A), the chemical shifts being indicative of sulfatio"

Both classes of mutants harbored substitutions within the cytoplasmic C1a domain. Mutations that inactivated the enzyme were often at highly conserved positions. Those that blocked activation were grouped in two distinct regions: one close to the plane of the plasma membrane and another halfway within the C1 loop.

Adenylyl cyclases catalyze the conversion of ATP into the second messenger cAMP. Modulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by hormone and neurotransmitter receptors, through heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins), underlies a wide variety of physiological events(1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar). The genes for eight types of mammalian, one Drosophila, and one Dictyostelium adenylyl cyclase all encode proteins that are predicted to span the membrane 12 times and contain two large cytoplasmic domains (about 40 kDa each)(2Tang W.J.

Each cytoplasmic domain contains a region of homology (designated C1a and C2a) with the catalytic domains of several adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases(2Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 869-872Google Scholar, 3Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Google Scholar). Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis have shown that the interaction between the two halves of the enzyme is necessary for activity and suggested that the two homologous cytoplasmic domains are not equivalent(6Tang W.J.

Science. 1989; 245: 1054-1058Google Scholar, 9Devreotes P.N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 235-241Google Scholar). The chemoattractant receptor, cAR1, mediates, in addition to the events involved in chemotaxis, the activation of ACA and synthesis of cAMP. The regulation of ACA is similar to mammalian type II and IV adenylyl cyclases, which are synergistically stimulated by G protein βγ-subunits and activated by Gsα(10Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Google Scholar). Indeed, genetic and biochemical analyses have established that receptor and GTPγS activation of ACA requires two components: the βγ-subunits of the heterotrimeric G protein G2 and a novel cytosolic protein named CRAC for cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase(11Insall R.

Proper regulation of ACA is essential for the early stages of development during which 105 cells spontaneously aggregate and differentiate into fruiting bodies. Secretion of cAMP serves to relay chemotactic signals to distal cells which, in turn, migrate toward the center to form aggregates. Consequently, aca-, gβ-, and crac- cells cannot carry out aggregation and remain as smooth monolayers when plated on non-nutrient agar(5Pitt G.S. Milona N. Bordeis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Google Scholar, 11Insall R. Kuspa A. Lilly P.J. Shaulsky G. Levin L.R. Loomis M.F. Devreotes P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1537-1545Google Scholar, 12Wu L. Valkema R. van Haastert P.J.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Google Scholar). In this study we used complementation of the aca- phenotype as a convenient and efficient readout to identify loss-of-function mutations in ACA. The ACA cDNA was isolated using ACA-specific probes to screen a λgt11 cDNA library made from aggregation-competent Dictyostelium cells(5Pitt G.S. Milona N. Bordeis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Google Scholar, 13Klein P.S. Sun T.J. Saxe C.L. Kimmel A.R. Johnson R.L. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1988; 241: 1467-1472Google Scholar). Random mutagenesis of the ACA cDNA was performed using PCR under conditions that make the polymerase prone to misincorporations(14Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar, 15Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Applications. 1992; 2: 28-33Google Scholar). Specific primers containing NdeI (at position 799 of the ACA gene) or BbsI (at position 2462) sites were used under the following conditions: 1 mM each dNTPs for weak mutagenesis and 0.5 mM dATP and 1 mM each of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP for strong mutagenesis; 6 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2; 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 0.01% gelatin, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) for 100-μl reactions. Following an initial melting of 3 min at 94°C, 30 cycles of denaturation (90 s at 94°C), annealing (90 s at 55°C), and extension (120 s at 72°C) were performed. The PCR products were isolated and subcloned into the NdeI/BbsI sites of a wild-type ACA cDNA in pBC (chloramphenicol-resistant) using XL-1 Blue electrocompetent cells (Stratagene). The libraries were finally transferred to an extrachromosomal Dictyostelium expression vector (pCP33) using the same electrocompetent bacteria. Both of these cloning steps routinely yielded greater than 50,000 independent clones. The libraries were electroporated into aca- cells (5Pitt G.S. Milona N. Bordeis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad gene pulser as described previously(16Howard P.K. Ahern K.G. Firtel R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2613-2623Google Scholar). The anticipated 4000-5000 transformants were equally divided on 24-well plates and selected using 20 μg/ml G418. Screening for loss-of-function mutants was performed by clonally spreading transformants on Klebsiella aerogenes lawns as described(17Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Google Scholar). Single cells deposited on a bacterial lawn divide and form a plaque as the growing edge consumes the bacteria. Cells within the plaque starve and undergo development making phenotypic scoring unequivocal. About 500 transformants/well were screened by clonally spreading 100-200 clones/100-mm dish. After 4-5 days, the aggregation-deficient mutants were transferred from the plaque to liquid medium and grown under G418 selection. The selected clones were rescreened for phenotype using development on non-nutrient agar plates at 22°C as described previously(18Devreotes P. Fontana D. Klein P. Sherring J. Theibert A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 299-331Google Scholar). Cell samples were solubilized in Laemmli buffer(19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and 2 × 106 cell eq were subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed on nitrocellulose membranes using a peptide antibody directed against the last 15 amino acids of ACA. The antiserum was diluted 1:8000, and detection was performed by chemiluminescence using a donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). Using either vegetative cells or 5-h stage cells repeatedly stimulated with 50 nM cAMP, adenylyl cyclase assays were performed as described previously with 100 μM ATP, 2 mM MgSO4 (basal), 5 mM MnSO4, or 40 μM GTPγS and 1 μM cAMP for 2 min at room temperature(20Pupillo M. Insall R. Pitt G.S. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1229-1234Google Scholar). For CRAC supplementation, cells were lysed into cytosol derived from cells overexpressing CRAC(21Lilly P. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1659-1665Google Scholar). Typically, 540 μl of cell lysates with or without GTPγS and cAMP were mixed with 120 μl of CRAC-containing supernatants and incubated on ice for 4 min, and 200 μl of this mixture was assayed. For the cAMP stimulation of adenylyl cyclase assays, 5-h stage cells were treated with 10 μM cAMP (at room temperature), lysed at the times indicated, and assayed for 1 min in the presence of exogenous CRAC(20Pupillo M. Insall R. Pitt G.S. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1229-1234Google Scholar, 21Lilly P. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1659-1665Google Scholar). [3H]cAMP binding was performed as described on membranes derived from 5-h starved cells pulsed with 50 nM cAMP in the presence or absence of 100 μM GTP(22van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 597-604Google Scholar). Bound [3H]cAMP was recovered by spinning through silicone oil as described(22van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 597-604Google Scholar). Total Dictyostelium DNA from 4 × 107 cells was prepared as described previously (23Nellen W. Datta S. Reymond C. Sivertsen A. Mann S. Crowley T. Firtel R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 67-100Google Scholar) and transformed into competent XL-1 Blue bacteria (Stratagene). Rescued plasmids were grown, and DNA was extracted using standard molecular biology techniques. The recovered plasmids were then transformed into Dictyostelium aca- cells and sequenced using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Random mutagenesis of the ACA gene was achieved by error-prone PCR. We mutagenized a 1.7-kilobase pair region of the ACA cDNA corresponding to five predicted transmembrane helices as well as the C1 domain (Fig. 1). The mutagenized cDNAs were subcloned into an extrachromosomal expression vector. We used a Dictyostelium-specific shuttle vector (pCP33), which was shown to give high transformation efficiencies (>10-4) and 100% segregation (i.e. after transformation, each transformant contains a unique mutated plasmid). pCP33 was derived from the p155d1 plasmid constructed by Hughes et al.(24Hughes J.E. Kiyosawa H. Welker D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6117-6124Google Scholar). It contains sequences needed for extrachromosomal replication derived from Dictyostelium nuclear plasmid Ddp1, the neomycin gene, and a bacterial backbone for replication in Escherichia coli. The ACA gene was cloned downstream of the actin-15 promoter(25Knecht D.A. Cohen S.M. Loomis W.F. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3973-3983Google Scholar), which causes the ACA gene to be overexpressed compared with wild type (data not shown). The library was electroporated into aca- cells, and the resulting transformants were screened by clonally spreading them on K. aerogenes lawns (see “Experimental Procedures”). Wild-type ACA transformants aggregate to form “rough” plaques with 100% efficiency; loss-of-function mutants that fail to aggregate are readily detected as “smooth” plaques (Fig. 2A).Figure 2:Phenotypic screen and protein expression of ACA mutants.

WT refers to aca- cells in which the wild-type ACA gene is overexpressed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Strong and weak PCR mutagenesis conditions were used, and the results of the screens are presented in Table 1. A total of 120 aggregation-deficient transformants were analyzed for ACA expression using a C-terminal peptide antibody that specifically labels a ~160-kDa band in cells overexpressing a WT ACA gene (Fig. 2B). Forty mutants showed protein expression. The level of expression varied between mutants and was always greater (up to 10-fold) or equal to that observed in wild-type parental cells (AX3). Upon rescreening for development on non-nutrient agar, the 40 protein-expressing mutants all remained aggregation-deficient. The non-regulated adenylyl cyclase activity of these clones was measured in the presence of MnSO4 and revealed that 17 of the 40 mutants had activity (Table 1). Eight mutants (4 active, 4 inactive) were selected at random and their mutated plasmid was recovered and retransformed into aca- cells. Each plasmid recapitulated the phenotype. Seven of the eight recapitulated mutants showed high protein expression and were either catalytically inactive (I1, I2, I3, I4) or active (U1, U2, U3) (Fig. 3, A and B). One mutant (U4) showed no protein expression upon retransformation and was discarded. Comparison of the enzymatic activities in lysates prepared from AX3 cells and from aca- cells overexpressing wild-type ACA (Fig. 3B) shows that aggregation can occur over a 10-fold range of adenylyl cyclase activity. Clearly, U1, U2, and U3 fall within this limit. Presumably, these active mutants are aggregation-deficient because they are “uncoupled” from surface receptor or G protein stimulation.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To characterize the biochemical defect in U1, U2, and U3, we dissected the receptor-G protein-adenylyl cyclase cascade. To determine if receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase was normal, we measured ACA activity, in the presence of CRAC, following the addition of exogenous cAMP to intact cells (see below) (Fig. 3C). Under such conditions, cells overexpressing wild-type ACA show a rapid increase in enzyme activity, peaking 1-2 min after addition of cAMP, followed by a return to basal levels within 7-10 min. Neither U1, U2, nor U3 showed chemoattractant-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase, explaining why they fail to aggregate. To assess the integrity of the interaction between cAR1 and G2, we performed an in vitro GTP-induced inhibition of binding assay. In this assay, the presence of GTP, which promotes the uncoupling of the G protein α-subunit form both the receptor and its β- and γ-subunits, considerably reduces the affinity of the agonist-receptor interaction. All three mutants showed normal high affinity binding to cAMP. In addition, in the presence of GTP, binding was reduced by 68, 65, 67, and 69% for WT, U1, U2, and U3, respectively (data not shown). Since these results showed that the defects in these mutants are downstream of G protein activation, we performed an in vitro GTPγS stimulation assay. As shown in Fig. 3D, U1, U2, and U3 exhibited no G protein-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. Moreover, these defects were not reversed by the addition of excess exogenous CRAC (Fig. 3D). Due to the limited availability of CRAC in lysates of cells overexpressing wild-type ACA, this addition typically potentiates GTPγS stimulation. We sequenced the mutagenized inserts, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4. The overall frequency of mutagenesis was very low, even under strong PCR mutagenesis conditions, and ranged from 1 to 8 base pair changes/mutant sequenced. Of a total of 23 point mutations identified, 6 were transversions. Twenty of the 23 mutations resulted in a change of amino acid and 3 were silent. Interestingly, we also isolated a mutant bearing an in-frame 213-nucleotide (71-amino acid) deletion within the second and third transmembrane domain (U1). Out of the 20 missense point mutations characterized, only two occurred within the predicted transmembrane domains (I2, I3). For the catalytically inactive mutants, we discovered that point mutations clustered within a highly conserved stretch of glycine residues located between positions 626 and 672 for three of the four mutants analyzed (Fig. 4B). Indeed, I1 displayed a single point mutation at a highly conserved glycine residue (G629C) (Fig. 4A). For I2 the introduction of a hydroxyl group on a neighboring conserved glycine residue (G633S) as well as an asparagine to aspartate change at position 333 also rendered the protein inactive. In addition, among its six substitutions, mutant I3 carried an isoleucine to asparagine (position 640) change at a conserved hydrophobic residue flanking one of the highly conserved glycine residues (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that this stretch of conserved residues within the C1a domain of ACA is important for catalytic activity. Mutant I4 exhibited six missense mutations located throughout the C1 domain (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, one of them (D488G) corresponded to a site-directed mutant of a highly conserved aspartate residue (D354A) shown to render the mammalian type I adenylyl cyclase catalytically inactive while still capable of binding to Gsα.1 Two of the three GTPγS-insensitive mutants, U2 and U3, displayed two and three point mutations, respectively, within the C1a domain (Fig. 4A). Tang and Gilman (26Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Google Scholar) showed that a soluble type I/type II chimera lacking transmembrane domains retains sensitivity to Gsα stimulation. Our results also suggest that regulatory sites lie within the cytoplasmic domains, along with the catalytic sites. Analysis of their location revealed that the substitutions grouped in two distinct regions: one close to the plane of the plasma membrane and another halfway within the C1 loop. The cluster close to the membrane is intriguing in that regions of cytoplasmic loops abutting the fifth, sixth, and seventh transmembrane domains of surface receptors are critical for G protein interaction(27Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Google Scholar). Our data suggest that similar membrane-apposed regions are involved in G protein regulation of adenylyl cyclases. We are currently separating the two groups of mutations in U2 and U3 and isolating additional mutants to more precisely define this regulatory domain. Our results are different but not mutually exclusive from those of Chen et al.(28Chen J. DeVivo M. Dinjus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. Science. 1995; 268: 1166-1169Google Scholar), who, using mammalian type II adenylyl cyclase peptides, recently demonstrated that Gβγ-subunits may interact with a region of C2a. Although U1 had similar biochemical properties as U2 and U3, it displayed a 71-amino acid deletion within the second and third transmembrane domain (Fig. 4A). Thus it would be predicted to contain only four transmembrane domains in its N-terminal half. Since this mutant showed normal catalytic activity, we were confident that it acquired an appropriate conformation. However, we reasoned that U1 might not be targeted to the correct subcellular location; missorting could preclude its appropriate receptor and G protein regulation. Xiao and Devreotes 3Z. Xiao and P. N. Devreotes, manuscript in preparation. recently demonstrated that cAR1 and ACA co-localize within specific plasma membrane subdomains. We carried out their subcellular fractionation procedure as an additional assessment of all the mutants. While both U2 and U3 exhibited a normal ACA distribution, U1 showed a drastically lower amount of ACA associated with cAR1 (data not shown). We propose that U1 is resistant to receptor and GTPγS stimulation mainly because it cannot access activated Gβγ-subunits. Indeed, following cAMP activation of wild-type cells, CRAC is translocated to membranes. In gβ- cells this CRAC membrane association does not occur and GTPγS-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activation cannot be measured(21Lilly P. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1659-1665Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive mutants I2 and I3 also exhibited abnormal subcellular distributions (data not shown). However, U1 illustrates that while co-localization with cAR1 may be required for appropriate regulation, it is not essential for catalytic activity. We conclude that the defects in I2 and I3 are most likely due to the mutations in C1a as described above. Interestingly, these two missorted mutants also harbored mutations within the predicted transmembrane domains (as did U1; Fig. 4A). These results suggest that correct sorting may be dependent on features within the transmembrane domains. Using our screen, both catalytically inactive and receptor/G protein-resistant adenylyl cyclase mutants can be efficiently and simply isolated from a randomly mutagenized population of molecules. Indeed, this is the first report of independent mutations that clearly separate these defects. Moreover, we have devised a way to isolate gain-of-function adenylyl cyclase proteins by transforming the mutagenized ACA libraries into crac- cells and isolating aggregation-competent clones. We can use suppression of the crac- phenotype to screen for ACA mutants with high, unregulated activity or for those that retain regulated activity in the absence of CRAC, bringing more insight into the Gβγ-subunit regulation of adenylyl cyclases We thank Dr. Dennis Welker for supplying the p155d1 plasmid, Zhan Xiao for providing the procedure for isolation of cAR1- and ACA-containing membranes using sucrose gradients, Calin Vasiliu for sequencing, Ji Yun Kim and Michael Caterina for advice on the GTP-induced inhibition of cAMP binding, Dr. Robert Insall for helpful discussions, and Drs.

The absence of a build-up phase and similarity in lifetime in the decay kinetics of directly excited (488 nm) terbium allows for the assignment of the submillisecond component in the 280 nm excited sample to bound terbium.

INTRODUCTIONMetalloenzyme research has been greatly aided by the isomorphic replacement of intrinsic and spectroscopically silent metals (i.e. Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) with optical and magnetic probes such as Mn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Eu3+, and Tb3+. Because of its similar size and preference for strong oxygen donor groups as ligands, the use of the extrinsic luminescent probe Tb3+ as a replacement for Ca2+ is particularly well established(1Brittain H.G. Richardson F.S. Martin R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1976; 98: 8255-8260Google Scholar, 2Hogue C.W.V. MacManus J.P. Banville D. Szabo A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13340-13347Google Scholar, 3Martin R.B.

For the typical concentrations used in terbium-protein systems, <10−3M, the emission of free terbium in solution is generally not observed following direct UV excitation with conventional sources because of its low extinction coefficient (ε285≈0.4 M−1 cm−1 for Tb3+ complexes of diethylenetriaminopentaacetic acid(5Bruno J. Horrocks Jr., W.D. Zauhar R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7016-7026Google Scholar)), whereas, when bound to a protein and in proximity to photoexcited aromatic residues, energy transfer is very efficient(3Martin R.B. Richardson F.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1979; 2: 181-209Google Scholar). The enhanced terbium luminescence thus observed has been used analytically to determine binding constants (6Duportail G. Lefevre J.-F. Lestienne P. Dimicoli J.-L. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1377-1382Google Scholar, 7Eberspach I. Strassburger W. Glatter U. Gerday C. Wollmer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 67-76Google Scholar) and, most importantly, assuming that a Förster-type dipole-dipole energy transfer mechanism is established, to extract intraprotein donor-acceptor pair distances (for example see (8Luk C.K. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2838-2843Google Scholar) and (9Marriott G. Kirk W.R. Johnsson N. Weber K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7004-7011Google Scholar)).Although enhanced terbium luminescence has found extensive use in metalloenzyme studies, the nature of the energy transfer mechanism and the identification of the molecular donor states involved is far from clear. For some terbium-substituted metalloenzymes, energy transfer has been convincingly established to proceed by way of a long-range nonradiative transfer from protein aromatic singlet states(5Bruno J. Horrocks Jr., W.D. Zauhar R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7016-7026Google Scholar, 10Horrocks W.D. Collier W.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 2856-2862Google Scholar). At shorter donor-acceptor distances, however, a Dexter exchange mechanism is suggested(2Hogue C.W.V. MacManus J.P. Banville D. Szabo A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13340-13347Google Scholar). The observation of increased terbium luminescence following deoxygenation of terbium containing samples of synthetic peptides (4MacManus J.P. Hogue C.W. Marsden B.J. Sikorska M. Szabo A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10358-10366Google Scholar) and several calcium-binding proteins (11Prendergast F.G. Lu J. Callahan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4075-4078Google Scholar) provides strong evidence that protein triplet states may be involved. Indeed, for nonbiological systems the involvement of aromatic triplet states as donors has long been known(12Dawson W.R. Kropp J.L. Windsor M.W. J. Chem. Phys. 1966; 45: 2410-2418Google Scholar, 13Crosby G.A. Whan R.E. Alire R.M. J. Chem. Phys. 1961; 34: 743-748Google Scholar, 14Bhaumik M.L. El-Sayed M.A. J. Chem.

Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10326-10340Google Scholar) has considered the mechanisms of dipole-dipole, electron exchange, superexchange, external heavy atom effect, and electron transfer in the interpretation of fluorescence quenching of one to one lanthanide complexes of an indolyl-EDTA 1The abbreviations used are: indolyl-EDTAS-N-[2-[bis(carboxymethyl)amino]-3-[3-indolyl]propyl]-N-(2-carboxymethyl)glycineAPE. coli alkaline phosphataseholoAPAP with a full complement of metals as found in the native stateapoAPmetal-depleted APTbAPapoAP in the presence of excess terbiumRTProom temperature phosphorescence. derivative where the metal ion is held in a cofacial geometry about 6 Å from the center of the indole ring. It was found for terbium complexes that the majority of the observed energy transfer derived from the indole triplet state and was not dipole-dipole in nature. Of particular relevance to the work reported here is the kinetic study of terbium luminescence complexed to elastase(17Martini J.-L. Tetreau C. Pochon F. Tourbez H. Lentz J.-M. Lavalette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 467-473Google Scholar), where the observation of an oxygen-sensitive growth of emission following UV excitation was interpreted as evidence of energy transfer from a triplet state donor via electron exchange. Whether or not these results are general or specific for the terbium-elastase system is open to question.In the current work we extend the above observations implicating aromatic triplet states in the enhanced luminescence of terbium-protein complexes by using a protein that is well characterized with respect to tryptophan room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). For this purpose the metalloenzyme Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (AP) was chosen. Of its three tryptophan residues per subunit, Trp109, Trp220, and Trp268, only Trp109 shows RTP (18Strambini G.B. Gabellieri E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 643-648Google Scholar, 19Domanus J. Strambini G.B. Galley W.C. Photochem. Photobiol. 1980; 31: 15-21Google Scholar) with a remarkably long (2 s) lifetime in extensively deoxygenated samples. Given the proximity of Trp109 to the AP metal-binding sites, we anticipated its phosphorescence to be useful in elucidating the nature of energy transfer to AP-bound terbium (TbAP). We note that a recent report (20Cioni P. Strambini G.B. Degan P. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1992; 13: 289-294Google Scholar) suggests that only the singlet state of Trp109 plays a role in enhancing the luminescence from TbAP. In the present work we report direct kinetic evidence for the enhanced luminescence in TbAP originating at least in part via energy transfer from the triplet state of Trp109. Our investigation broadens the important conclusions of the terbium-elastase study and highlights the need for caution in the application of the Förster equation for distance determinations in terbium-substituted metalloenzymes.MATERIALS AND METHODSAP was purchased from Sigma (Type III-S) as a suspension in 2.5 M ammonium sulfate and exchanged into 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, the buffer in which all spectroscopic measurements were performed. Proteinconcentrations were determined spectrophotometrically with a Shimadzu UV-260 or Cary 2400 UV-VIS based on A0.1%278 = 0.72 (21Plocke D.J. Levinthal C. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 373-378Google Scholar) and a molecular weight of 94,058(22Bradshaw R.A. Cancedda F. Ericsson L.H. Neumann P.A. Piccoli S.P. Schesinger M.J. Shriefer K. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3473-3477Google Scholar). Metal-depleted AP (apoAP) was prepared using the method of Bosron et al.(23Bosron W.F. Anderson R.A. Falk M.C. Kennedy F.S. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 610-614Google Scholar) using the chelating agent 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid. Atomic absorption analysis (Perkin-Elmer 7000) of apoAP found less than 0.01 g atom of zinc and 0.01-0.02 g atom of magnesium/mol of protein. ApoAP activity (24Falk M.C. Bethune J.L. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1471-1478Google Scholar) was found to be less than 1% of native AP (holoAP), consistent with complete metal removal. Terbium-substituted AP was made by slowly adding, with stirring, an appropriate amount of a concentrated stock solution of TbCl3 (Aldrich). Prior to spectroscopic measurements in the absence of oxygen, the capped sample cuvette was allowed to attain equilibrium with a continuous stream of purified argon(25Englander S.W. Calhoun D.B. Englander J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 300-306Google Scholar). The oxygen content of an air saturated solution is taken to be 260 μM(26Dean J.A. Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1973: 10-15Google Scholar).Steady state emission spectra were recorded using a SPEX Fluorolog II spectrofluorimeter. Time-resolved phosphorescence measurements and decay analysis were made using instrumentation and methods described previously(27Schlyer B.D. Schauerte J.A. Steel D.G. Gafni A. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1192-1202Google Scholar). Spectra were not corrected for photomultiplier wavelength response. The UV excitation source used for the time-resolved experiments was the frequency-doubled output of a neodymium ion (Nd3+) doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Y3Al5O12) laser pumped dye laser. Data were collected using photon counting techniques in which the count rate was kept well below the instrumental bandwidth to prevent counting errors. For experiments where direct excitation of terbium was required, an argon ion laser operating at 488 nm was used. An optical chopper with a small aperture running at 48 Hz was used to produce a short pulse (60-80 μs) from this continuous wave source.Decay kinetics of enhanced terbium luminescence were analyzed using a simple model that assumes irreversible energy transfer from the excited triplet state of Trp109T1(Trp)* to terbium-bound AP: T1(Trp)*-Tb→kETSo(Trp)-Tb*(Eq. 1) T1(Trp)*-Tb→kdSo(Trp)-Tb+hv(Eq. 2) So(Trp)-Tb*→kaSo(Trp)-Tb+hv'(Eq. 3) where kd and ka are rates for the excited state deactivation of the donor T1(Trp)* and acceptor Tb*, respectively, in the absence of energy transfer, kET. The rate equations for the de-excitation of [T1(Trp)*] and [Tb*] are: d[T1(Trp)*/dt=-(kd+kET)[T1(Trp)*]=-Γd[T1(Trp)*](Eq. 4) d[Tb*]/dt=kET[T1(Trp)*]-ka(Tb)*](Eq. 5) which are solved to give [T1(Trp)*](t)=D0exp{-Γdt}(Eq. 6) [Tb*](t)=C exp{-Γdt}+(A0-C)exp{-kat}(Eq. 7) where the concentration C is a collection of time-independent terms, C=(D0 kET)/(ka-Γd)(Eq. 8) D0 and A0 can be respectively identified with the initial Trp109 triplet state population, [T1(Trp)*]o (following intersystem crossing from S1(Trp)), and the initial excited terbium population, [Tb*]o, which arises either through direct excitation at 280 nm or via energy transfer from one or more fast decaying protein excited state(s). Note that for A0 = 0 the prefactors associated with decay rates ka and Γd have equal and opposite signs, with the larger decay rate always having the negative amplitude. In practice, must be modified (as discussed below) to account for heterogeneity of the system.RESULTSLuminescenceThe replacement of the native AP metals with Tb3+ results in terbium emission when the sample is excited at 280 nm as shown in Fig. 1. Terbium absorbs only very weakly at 280 nm (5Bruno J. Horrocks Jr., W.D. Zauhar R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7016-7026Google Scholar) relative to protein aromatic groups and is only marginally directly excited under the conditions used here. Furthermore, the addition of 80 μM Tb3+ to a 4 μM solution of holoAP did not generate any appreciable terbium emission. It is clear from these experiments that terbium specifically binds to apoAP and that the enhanced luminescence arises from sensitized excitation, likely by energy transfer from phosphatase aromatic residues. Consistent with this statement is the observation of a tryptophan-like excitation spectrum of bound terbium (data not shown).Deoxygenation of the TbAP sample leads to a 4-5-fold enhancement of terbium emission (Fig. 1). Previously it was suggested (4MacManus J.P. Hogue C.W. Marsden B.J. Sikorska M. Szabo A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10358-10366Google Scholar) that increases in the emission of terbium complexed to model calcium-binding peptides following deoxygenation were caused by sample precipitation (i.e. an artifact of the deoxygenation procedure). We note that the enhanced terbium emission observed here following deoxygenation cannot be ascribed to protein aggregation. This is clearly demonstrated by the similar magnitude of elastic scattering seen at 560 nm (second order of the 280 nm excitation) under the two conditions (Fig. 1).Also shown in Fig. 1 is the total luminescence spectrum of holoAP under deoxygenated conditions. The phosphorescence (T1 → S0) of Trp109, the only AP residue that shows RTP(18Strambini G.B. Gabellieri E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 643-648Google Scholar, 19Domanus J. Strambini G.B. Galley W.C. Photochem. Photobiol. 1980; 31: 15-21Google Scholar), is clearly shown to arise around 415 nm. When terbium is substituted for the native AP metals the phosphorescence is quenched.Decay KineticsBecause the emission of terbium in solution is insensitive to the presence of oxygen(11Prendergast F.G. Lu J. Callahan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4075-4078Google Scholar), the induced sensitivity upon binding to AP coupled with the excitation spectrum strongly suggest that the emission is partially sensitized by triplet state energy transfer from an AP tryptophan residue. When excited at 280 nm, the terbium emission shows an oxygen insensitive submillisecond lifetime associated with a negative prefactor (and) and oxygen-dependent long decay components associated with positive prefactors (Fig. 2). The decay transients require three lifetime components to account for heterogeneity in kET. For both deoxygenated and aerated samples, we find a single luminescent rise time and two oxygen-dependent decay times. The functional form used, justified below, to fit the data is given by: [Tb*](t) = C1exp{-Γd1t} + C2exp{-Γd2t} + (2A0 - C1 - C2)exp{-kat} where Γdi = kd+ kETi for i = 1, 2 and the values for the various parameters are given in Table 1. Judged by their oxygen sensitivity, by the lifetime that is orders of magnitude longer than the nanoseconds expected from singlet state decay, and by their steady state excitation spectrum, we assign the longer lifetime components, Γd1 and Γd2 in the above equation, to an alkaline phosphatase tryptophan triplet state. To verify this statement and identify the specific tryptophan involved, we have monitored the quenched Trp109 phosphorescence in TbAP at 440 nm following 280 nm excitation (Fig. 3, A and C). The longer lived components were found to exhibit tryptophan-like phosphorescence spectra (assigned to Trp109) and have lifetimes of 9 and 12 ms in deoxygenated and 2 and 3 ms in oxygenated samples. The reasonable agreement between the long-lived components observed at 440 nm (Trp109) and at 544 nm (bound terbium) for the deoxygenated and air-equilibrated samples indicate that they both arise from the Trp109 triplet state. Also included for comparison in Fig. 3 is the transient (B) of native AP in an air-saturated sample observed at 440 nm following 280 nm excitation. The major component of this decay has a lifetime of 3.3 ms. We note that the 3.3 ms lifetime of native AP in the air-equilibrated sample (260 μM O2) compared with 2.0 s in deoxygenated solution yield a value for the rate constant of Trp109 phosphorescence quenching by oxygen of 1.2 × 106M−1 s−1, in excellent agreement with the literature values(28Strambini G.B. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 23-28Google Scholar, 29Calhoun D.B. Englander S.W. Wright W.W. Vanderkooi J.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8466-8474Google Scholar).Figure 2:Terbium emission transient observed at 544 nm following pulsed excitation at 280 nm. A, air-equilibrated solution.

For D and E the decay rates are not affected by dissolved oxygen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A further check of our assignment of the 280 nm excitation-induced transient is afforded by observing the terbium decay at 544 nm following direct excitation of this cation into the weakly allowed transition at 488 nm. The results of this experiment (Fig. 3D) can be fit to 2 lifetimes, 430 (minor component) and 930 μs (Table 1). The 430-μs lifetime is assigned to free Tb+3(aq) because it is in good agreement with the 420 μs found for a TbCl3 solution (Fig. 3E) and with literature values(30Horrocks W.D. Sudnick D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 334-340Google Scholar). Because the lifetime of terbium is linearly related to the number of hydroxyl oscillators in its ligand field(30Horrocks W.D. Sudnick D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 334-340Google Scholar, 31Horrocks W.D. Schmidt G.F. Sudnick D.R. Kittrell C. Bernheim R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 2378-2380Google Scholar), the longer lifetime of terbium in TbAP relative to terbium free in solution is evidence for complexation. The notable absence of a decay component associated with a negative prefactor for directly excited terbium in TbAP is further proof of the participation of a protein aromatic residue in the excitation process serving as energy donor.Inspection of according to the above decay component assignment shows that the decay associated with the negative prefactor arises from terbium (ka in), implying that C in our model is positive and therefore greater than A0. This is consistent with its increased contribution to the decay following deoxygenation (Fig. 2) because under these conditions kd, and hence Γd, decreases.DISCUSSIONThe functional homodimer of AP contains two Zn2+ and one Mg2+ in each of two active sites(23Bosron W.F. Anderson R.A. Falk M.C. Kennedy F.S. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 610-614Google Scholar). Catalytic activity in the native enzyme requires Zn2+ at site M1 (32Simpson R.T. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 4343-4350Google Scholar). Although the role of the second Zn2+ (site M2) and Mg2+ (site M3) were once believed to be largely structural in nature(32Simpson R.T. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 4343-4350Google Scholar), their close proximity to one another lends itself to the idea of a cocatalytic site(33Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6493-6500Google Scholar).The experiments presented here do not allow us to determine which metal-binding site contains the terbium(s) involved in triplet state energy transfer from Trp109. Experiments where only one equivalent of terbium was added to apoAP (data not shown) still show the distinctive early rise of terbium luminescence upon pulsed excitation indicative of a triplet state donor. The analysis of the decay data again requires three lifetime components, one associated with the build-up and attributed to terbium decay and two with the decay of the enhanced emission fed by the donor tryptophan. We attribute the multiplicity of donor lifetimes in these experiments to a difference in terbium-Trp109 distances resulting in different energy transfer rates. This may occur when multiple terbium ions occupy distinct metal-binding sites or alternately when a single terbium residing at a single site adopts multiple distances with respect to Trp109 due to different protein conformations. The distances (obtained from the atomic coordinates deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank(34Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Google Scholar)) from the indole ring center (taken to be the midpoint of the Cδ2-Cε2 bond in the following discussion) to sites M1, M2, and M3 are 13.6, 9.7, and 9.4 Å. Below we show how the subtle differences in distance between Trp109 and terbium in M2 and M3 are consistent, when interpreted in terms of an exchange mechanism, with the observed multiple donor decay kinetics.Long Terbium LifetimeStrambini and co-workers (20Cioni P. Strambini G.B. Degan P. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1992; 13: 289-294Google Scholar) report that when terbium is added to nonphosphorescent apoAP (35Cioni P. Piras L. Strambini G.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 573-579Google Scholar) the lifetime of Trp109 is restored to a value close to that observed in holoAP (1.95 s) with an accompanying oxygen-insensitive enhanced terbium emission. From these observations they concluded that terbium binds to site M1, thus restoring the phosphorescence of Trp109, and that the enhanced luminescence is sensitized by a singlet state donor, there being no contribution from the Trp109 triplet state. These results are clearly in contradiction to our strong evidence for Trp109 triplet state involvement in energy transfer to bound terbium. Although the origin of this contradiction is not fully understood, it is not unreasonable to assume that metal contamination is responsible for the relatively strong Trp109 phosphorescence in the earlier TbAP study(20Cioni P. Strambini G.B. Degan P. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1992; 13: 289-294Google Scholar). A small portion of the AP sample, contaminated with zinc or another metal that does not act as a phosphorescence quencher, could explain the observation of a near 2-s lifetime, therefore obscuring contributions of Trp109 undergoing relatively rapid energy transfer to the bound terbium.It should be noted that the 280 nm induced decays shown in Fig. 2 clearly have nonzero values at t = 0. Thus the contribution from either directly excited terbium or from energy transfer to terbium from fast decaying protein excited states, most likely singlet states, is significant.Energy Transfer MechanismThe rate of energy transfer is given by kET = Γd - kd. Trp109 phosphorescence lifetime is little affected by exchanging AP metals with cations that show a low propensity for energy or electron transfer, such as Cd2+(35Cioni P. Piras L. Strambini G.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 573-579Google Scholar), and therefore we assume kd to be 0.5 s−1 upon terbium substitution, the value determined for the native enzyme in the absence of oxygen. The rates of energy transfer are found to be 360 and 120 s−1. As an independent check we find kET to be 470 and 130 s−1 for the air-saturated TbAP sample, with kd = 300 s−1 as determined above. The degree of correspondence between the two measurements is reassuring and demonstrates that kET is oxygen-independent.Because the rate of energy transfer according to a dipole-dipole (Förster) mechanism is proportional to the overlap of the normalized donor emission and unnormalized acceptor absorbance (J), we anticipate that its contribution to energy transfer in TbAP will be small given the negligible absorbance of terbium. To verify this we have estimated the energy transfer rate using the Förster equation(36Förster T. Z. Naturforsch. 1949; 5: 321-327Google Scholar), kETdd = 8.785 × 1023κ2η−4kRADR−6J s−1, where η is the refractive index of the medium (taken as 1.36), kRAD is the radiative decay rate of the unquenched tryptophan triplet state (0.087 s−1(37Galley W.C. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1831-1838Google Scholar)), and the donor-acceptor distance (R) is taken to be 9.55 Å, an average of the two nearest metal-binding sites, M2 and M3. The orientation factor, κ2, is assumed to be 2/3. The overlap integral (J) was determined from the phosphorescence spectrum of AP and the absorbance spectrum of a standard TbCl3 solution. With J = 1.84 × 10−20M−1 cm3, we determine kETdd = 3.6 × 10−4 s−1, which is more than six orders of magnitude less than the experimental result. As anticipated, the triplet state is not significantly quenched via a dipole-dipole process, and therefore an exchange mechanism is indicated.In electron exchange the rate of energy transfer is given by kETexc = (2π/h)Z2J‘, where J‘ is the spectral overlap integral normalized with respect to both donor emission and acceptor extinction and Z is the exchange integral(38Dexter D.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1953; 21: 836-850Google Scholar). Assuming hydrogenic wave functions, Dexter arrived at the approximation kETexc = KJ‘exp(−2R/L), where K is a constant not related to experimental parameters and L is the average orbital radius involved in the initial and final states for the donor-acceptor pair separated by distance R.As suggested above the exponential distance dependence of exchange is consistent with the observation of two donor lifetimes in TbAP if terbium ions in sites M2 and M3 act as independent quenchers. For example, assuming that K, J‘, and L are of similar magnitude for both sites and taking L as one (39Strambini G.B. Galley W.C. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1976; 39: 257-260Google Scholar), the difference in distance between the two sites to Trp109 (0.3 Å) translates into an expected ratio in rate of energy transfer of 2. This is in reasonable agreement with the experimental ratios of kET 360 and 120 s−1 (ratio = 3) and kET and 470 and 130 s−1 (ratio = 4) for deoxygenated and oxygenated samples, respectively. We note that such an analysis is inconsistent if the most distant site M1 and either M2 (ratio = 2400) or M3 (ratio = 4400) are considered. Thus if distance is the main determinant of kET, the contribution of terbium in M1 would not be observed in the present experiment, being instead overwhelmed by terbium in site(s) M2 and/or M3. Furthermore the above interpretation suggests that terbium is partitioned between sites such that the likely occupancy is TbAP (M1, M2) and TbAP (M1, M3), the binding of metal in M1 being a prerequisite for phosphorescence(35Cioni P. Piras L. Strambini G.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 573-579Google Scholar).An alternative explanation for the multiexponential donor decay based on the presence of a single terbium acceptor is that small conformational heterogeneity exists in the TbAP sample. Given the distance sensitivity of the exchange mechanism, the postulated conformers would therefore show differences in Trp109-terbium distance of 0.3-0.4 Å. It clearly will be necessary to conduct a more detailed study to determine the exact terbium binding-site distribution in this system.It is interesting to compare our results with those obtained for the terbium-elastase system (17Martini J.-L. Tetreau C. Pochon F. Tourbez H. Lentz J.-M. Lavalette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 467-473Google Scholar) in which energy transfer was assigned to an exchange process with a rate constant of 8300 s−1, 17-70 times larger than that found for TbAP.

This approach is a valuable tool to characterize the binding site of spiramycin as well as the peptidyl transferase center at the molecular level. INTRODUCTIONStudies on ribosomal structure and function have been greatly aided by the use of antibiotics acting as inhibitors of protein biosynthesis. Such studies have shed light on functional domains of the ribosome and also have helped to characterize the antibiotic binding sites (Cundliffe, 1990; Cooperman et al., 1990).The location of greatest functional and structural interest in the ribosome is the peptidyl transferase center, since it is the site where peptide bond formation takes place (Monro et al., 1969). To date, only limited data exist on the fine structure of the peptide moiety of this important enzymatic center, whereas detailed structural information is available on the rRNA moiety (Brimacombe et al., 1990).A more minute insight into the topography of the peptidyl transferase center can be obtained by cross-linking ribosomal antibiotics to their functional sites (Cooperman et al., 1990). Prominent among these antibiotics are macrolides. They can be roughly classified structurally and functionally into two main groups represented by spiramycin and erythromycin, respectively (Vazquez, 1979). The erythromycin group has a 13-carbon lactone ring that is glycosylated in two positions by different monosaccharides. The second group consists of a 15-carbon lactone ring system, usually derivatized at only one position by a disaccharide. Members of the erythromycin family apparently block protein synthesis only after the formation of several peptide bonds due to steric hindrance by the drug molecule (Moazed and Noller, 1987; Contreras and Vazquez, 1977). The spiramycin group of macrolides exerts its effects in the very early stage of peptide bond formation by competing for the ribosomal A-site with the incoming charged tRNA as determined by kinetic analysis with puromycin (Dinos et al., 1993). In this respect the effect is comparable with that of typical peptidyl transferase inhibitors such as chloramphenicol. The dissimilar modes of action of macrolides have mainly been attributed to the different sugar moieties attached to the lactone ring. So far, the question remains to be answered whether the two groups of macrolides have overlapping or in fact different binding-sites (Vazquez, 1979).A direct way to test both alternatives is to cross-link these molecules to their functional sites. Previous affinity labeling has revealed protein L22 as the major cross-linking site for erythromycin (Arévalo et al., 1988) and protein L27 for spiramycin (Tejedor and Ballesta, 1986), thus favoring the notion of different binding sites for the two groups. The amino acid residues involved in the respective cross-links have not been characterized so far but are of great interest in terms of elucidating the topography of the peptidyl transferase center.In this communication we report peptide regions of the small and large ribosomal subunit proteins cross-linked to spiramycin in the Escherichia coli ribosome that were identified by direct sequence analysis. The results present details of the peptide environment close to the peptidyl transferase center. The cross-linking data are integrated with the available data concerning the peptidyl transferase center topography.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe following buffers were used: BKM10, 10 mM borate (pH 7.0 at 37°C), 100 mM KCl, and 10 mM MgCl2; and BKM-β, as above plus 6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol.All chemicals were proanalysis grade or of higher quality, obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Endoproteinase Lys-C was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany).[3H]Dihydrospiramycin was prepared from spiramycin (Sigma Deisenhofen, Germany) by reduction of the aldehyde group in position C18 with [3H]borohydride (DuPont NEN). Completion of the reaction was checked by TLC. [3H]Dihydrospiramycin was repurified by RP-HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: RP-HPLCreversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographyLys-CLysobacter enzymogenes protease (EC 3.4.21.50)TP70total protein of 70 S ribosomes. on a laboratory-packed Vydac C18 column (5 μm, 300 Å) to remove decomposition products less than 30 days prior to use. The final product was analyzed by infrared and mass spectroscopy as well as by 1H and 13C NMR (data not shown).Preparation of RibosomesCells of E. coli strain MRE600 were grown and 70 S ribosomes were isolated as detailed by Brockmöller and Kamp(1986). 70 S ribosomes were extensively dialyzed against BKM10 at 4°C prior to affinity labeling.Specificity of Spiramycin Binding70 S ribosomes (0.2 μM) were incubated at 37°C for 15 min in the presence of 0.4 μM [3H]dihydrospiramycin (0.14 Ci/mmol) in BKM-β and increasing amounts of spiramycin. The ribosomes were precipitated for 3 h with acetone at −20°C, filtered through glass fiber filters (size 0.45 μm; Millipore) and washed with 60% acetone, 100 mM KCl. Filters were monitored for radioactivity by scintillation counting.Thermal Incorporation of [3H]Dihydrospiramycin into 70 S Ribosomes70 S ribosomes were activated at 37°C for 15 min prior to labeling (Bischof et al., 1994). Thermal incorporation of 1 μM [3H]dihydrospiramycin (0.14 Ci/mmol) into activated 70 S ribosomes (50 A260 units/ml) was performed in BKM10 buffer at 37°C for 30 min under constant mild agitation in a waterbath. Immediately after radiolabeling, the ribosomes were precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol, 2-mercaptoethanol (9:1) for 2 h at −20°C. Reprecipitation of the ribosomes four times removed more than 90% of nonincorporated spiramycin (data not shown). The final pellet was redissolved in BKM10 buffer (340 A260 units/ml), and proteins were extracted for 5 min with 50% acetic acid (Bischof et al., 1994). The precipitated rRNA was pelleted for 20 min at 13,000 rpm in an HB6-Sorvall rotor at 4°C. Supernatants were portioned into 30 A260 units and stored at −80°C. Radioactivity of ribosomal proteins and rRNA was monitored by liquid scintillation counting.Preparation and Purification of Labeled Ribosomal ProteinsTotal proteins of 70 S ribosomes were separated by RP-HPLC on a laboratory-packed Vydac C4 column (5 μm, 300 Å) employing a gradient of acetonitrile in water both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot of each protein fraction was counted in a liquid scintillation counter, the remainder lyophilized and stored at −80°C.Peptide MappingProtein fractions containing radioactivity were digested with endoproteinase Lys-C at an enzyme:substrate (total protein) ratio of 1:50 in 400 μl of 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, for 12 h. The digests were stopped by injection of the reaction mixture into the HPLC system. All peptide separations were performed on a Vydac C18 column as described by Kamp(1986) employing buffer A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and buffer B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Peak fractions were monitored for radioactivity. Fractions containing labeled peptides were dried under vacuum and sequenced in a model 477A pulsed liquid phase sequencer equipped with a model 120A phenylthiohydantoin derivative analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences were identified by comparison with sequences in the NBRF, Swiss Prot and RIBO data banks. 2B. Wittmann-Liebold, D. Dzionara, A. Beck, A. K. Köpcke, and Boeckh, T., unpublished results. RESULTSBinding Specificity of DihydrospiramycinSpecificity of dihydrospiramycin binding to 70 S ribosomes was tested in a saturation experiment. As is demonstrated in Fig. 1, increasing amounts of spiramycin competed with [3H]dihydrospiramycin binding, indicating a specific binding of dihydrospiramycin to the ribosome.Identification of Dihydrospiramycin-labeled Ribosomal Proteins and PeptidesIncorporation of dihydrospiramycin into 70 S ribosomes is a rather fast reaction. Approximately 50% of the total incorporation takes place within the first 2 min. The reaction reaches saturation after about 60 min. 2.6% of total radioactivity was specifically incorporated into ribosomes. 72% of this radioactivity was found in ribosomal proteins, and 17% was found in rRNA.[3H]Dihydrospiramycin-labeled total protein extracted from 70 S ribosomes was fractionated by C4 RP-HPLC. Five major radiolabeled peaks were detected in the chromatogram (Fig. 2). Most of the radioactivity was found in peaks 2, 3, and 4. Pooling and N-terminal sequence analysis of radioactive peaks revealed the protein composition of these pools. Table 1 summarizes these results. No obvious difference in the elution pattern of unlabeled and labeled total protein of 70 S ribosomes was observed (data not shown). Subsequent proteolytic fragmentation of labeled protein pools with endoproteinase Lys-C and separation of the resulting peptide mixtures by C18 RP-HPLC revealed only one peptide being labeled in the case of peaks 3, 4, and 13, while two and three peptides were found radiolabeled in peaks 20 and 2, respectively. Two examples of RP-HPLC separations of Lys-C-digested protein pools are presented in Fig. 3.Figure 2:A representative C4 RP-HPLC chromatogram of TP70 of E. coli after photolabeling with [3H]dihydrospiramycin and its corresponding radioactivity profile. 200 μg of TP70 was injected onto a Vydac C4 RP-HPLC column and eluted at 40°C with the following gradient: 10 min of isocratic elution with 6% solvent B (acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) followed by a linear gradient of 6-22% solvent B in 20 min, 22-50% solvent B in 270 min, and 50-99% B in 30 min.

However, for all residues determined the predicted phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were found. Therefore, the affinity cross-link product is obviously not stable under the harsh conditions of Edman chemistry, and indeed acid lability of the dehydrospiramycin cross-link was suggested by Tejedor and Ballesta(1986). We proved this assumption correct by extended exposure of affinity-labeled ribosomes in 20% trifluoroacetic acid, 10% trichloroacetic acid, and 2% acetic acid at sequencer-like temperatures (i.e. 48°C). Here, we found that most of the originally incorporated radioactivity was subsequently lost during the heat procedure (data not shown).Table 2 lists the sequences of all [3H]dihydrospiramycin cross-linked peptides together with the parental ribosomal proteins. It should be noted at this point that the sequence of the labeled S14 peptide (peak 13 in Table 2) abruptly terminated at position Asp-53. Eventually, this might be an indication for a modification. The peptides obtained in this study can be roughly divided into three classes according to the degree of their incorporated radioactivity: (i) high label, peptide region Ala1-Lys9 of protein S12; (ii) medium label, peptide region Thr5-Lys11 of protein L35, Ser6-Lys35 of protein L17, Leu47-Asp53 of protein S14, Tyr116-Lys119 of S12, and Ala5-Lys18 as well as Val66-Lys71 of protein L27; and (iii) low label, peptide region Ala57-Lys63 of protein L18.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONAffinity labeling with (dihydro)spiramycin is ideally suited to investigate structural components of the peptidyl transferase center in the ribosome. Similar to spiramycin, dihydrospiramycin inhibits peptide bond formation and is competing with puromycin for an overlapping binding site (Dinos et al., 1993). Our experimental approach was designed to identify peptide-(dihydro)spiramycin cross-links by direct peptide sequencing, thereby establishing data concerning the molecular environment of (dihydro)spiramycin in its functional binding site.Approximately 72% of dihydrospiramycin incorporated into ribosomal proteins. Extraction of labeled 70 S ribosomes and separation of ribosomal proteins by RP-HPLC resulted in 5 (dihydro)spiramycin-labeled protein fractions. Proteolytic digestion of these fractions and subsequent peptide sequence analysis of labeled peptides yielded peptide sequences from six different ribosomal proteins i.e. proteins S12, S14, L17, L18, L27, and L35 (Table 2).The proteins thus identified to be in close contact with the spiramycin molecule have been implicated to be close to or at the peptidyl transferase region by various other experimental approaches (Walleczek et al., 1988; Traut et al., 1986). Our results are also in good agreement with previous results of Tejedor and Ballesta(1986), who could unambiguously identify L27 as being the primary cross-linked product in the 50 S subunit and tentatively identify S9/S12 as those that are labeled to the highest degree in the small subunit. In addition, with L35 we could identify a ribosomal protein that had not yet been placed in the current ribosomal models.In our affinity-labeling approach with (dihydro)spiramycin the N-terminal region of S12 (positions Ala1-Lys9) was found to be labeled with the highest intensity. Additionally, we obtained a second cross-link with medium intensity in the C terminus of the protein (positions Tyr116-Lys119). These findings confirm speculations of Tejedor and Ballesta(1986) who proposed that S12 is involved in spiramycin binding, but these authors were not able to provide unambiguous experimental proof for their assumption.The results presented here for S12 are a bit surprising since macrolides were thought to bind only to the 50 S subunit (Vazquez, 1979). However, previous experiments with a macrolide-resistant L4 mutant in E. coli have demonstrated that additional mutations in proteins S12 and S5 of the 30 S subunit can mask this effect, thereby leading to a macrolide-sensitive phenotype again (Saltzman and Apirion, 1976). These findings shed light on the intricate influence both subunits have on the binding site as well as on the mode of action of macrolides. In the case of S12 this influence can be easily explained since the N-terminal region that we found labeled in our approach was also observed to be in close contact with the 16 S rRNA (Urlaub et al., 1995), most likely with the 530 loop or 900 stem loop (Stern et al., 1988). In addition, Alexander et al.(1994) identified S12 as a major neighbor to 16 S rRNA nucleotides 518-526. Accordingly, conformational changes in the N-terminal region of the protein can be transferred through the 16 S rRNA molecule, and by this means the overall topography of the macrolide binding site can be modulated.Immunoelectron microscopy (Stöffler-Meilicke and Stöffler, 1990) as well as neutron-scattering data (Capel et al., 1987) have placed S12 on the cytosolic side, close to the neck of the 30 S subunit. However, since the functional binding site of spiramycin is located directly in the peptidyl transferase center, which is believed to be located at the interface side of the 30 and 50 S subunit close to the base of the central protuberance (Oakes et al., 1990), at least the N-terminal as well as the C-terminal region of the protein have to be exposed at the peptidyl transferase center. This notion is supported by intraprotein cross-linking results of S12 and L16 (Traut et al., 1986). The latter is a well known constituent of the peptidyl transferase center and forms an intraprotein cross-link to L27, a protein that was also labeled in our approach. Another consequence that arises from the above results is that the 530 loop and/or the stem loop 900 of the 16 S rRNA must be exposed at the luminal side of the ribosome.The second constituent of the spiramycin binding site on the 30 S subunit is S14. This finding further demonstrates the importance the small subunit has on the macrolide binding site. The peptide stretch that was labeled (positions Leu47-Asp53) is adjacent to a peptide region that we found cross-linked to puromycin. This confirms that the midsection of S14 is a major component of the peptidyl transferase center.The main constituents of the spiramycin binding site on the 50 S subunit are proteins L17, L27, and L35. The location of L17 in the ribosome has been a subject of controversy. Walleczek et al. (1988) place it distant from the peptidyl transferase center, while Traut et al.(1986) position it closer to the peptidyl transferase center since it can be cross-linked to protein L16. Our results favor the Traut location of L17, at least of the N-terminal region (positions Ser6-Lys35). The discrepancies of the L17 location in both models could be brought into accordance if L17 possesses a more elongated structure. The finding that protein L17 is a major neighbor of nucleotides 2497-2505 of domain V supports this assumption. 3R. Alexander, personal communication. In the case of L27 there is no doubt about the localization of this protein in the ribosomal models. Protein-protein cross-linking studies (Traut et al., 1986) as well as immunoelectron microscopy (Stöffler-Meilicke and Stöffler, 1990) all place it slightly beyond and left of the base of the central protuberance toward the L1 arm. Since L27 is affinity-labeled by several photoreactive tRNA derivatives (Wower et al., 1993) as well as by chloramphenicol (Cooperman et al., 1990) and by tiamulin (Högenauer et al., 1981) it must be considered a central element of the tRNA binding site. In addition, it can be cross-linked to numerous nucleotides in domain VII of the 23 S rRNA, which is in close neighborhood to domain V, the latter being an essential constituent of the peptidyl transferase center (Brimacombe et al., 1990).A fair amount of labeling was found in L35. So far, no structural or functional information is available for this protein. However, it is obvious from our results that the N-terminal part of the protein must be part of the spiramycin binding pocket and therefore be exposed at the peptidyl transferase center. Additional data are necessary to clarify the significance of our results.The protein that was labeled to the weakest extent in our approach was L18 (positions Ala57-Lys63). It binds to the 5 S rRNA-complex and is implicated to be part of the peptidyl transferase center as proved by affinity-labeling (Cooperman et al., 1990) as well as by reconstitution studies (Hampl et al., 1981). Furthermore, L18 was one of the proteins we recently identified as being cross-linked to puromycin (Bischof et al., 1994). Both cross-link positions are adjacent to each other (puromycin, Tyr64-Lys68). Taking the S14 data into account this result indicates that at least part of the spiramycin and puromycin binding sites are close to each other.Another discussion point is noteworthy. As briefly mentioned in the discussion of the S12 results, a correlation of antibiotic and rRNA binding sites in ribosomal proteins was found (Urlaub et al., 1995). This general idea is supported by the existence of various other peptide-antibiotic cross-links that are found to be affinity-labeled in the same peptide region that is also in close neighborhood to the rRNA (Table 3). Most of the peptide regions listed in Table 3 are highly conserved and predominantly contain basic residues and/or aromatic residues that can contribute to a protein-rRNA interaction that is prone to disruption by the respective antibiotic. These findings shed light on the importance ribosomal proteins have on the correct folding of functional ribosomes. Our observations indicate that ribosomal proteins in many cases determine the formation of well defined structural and functional domains to which equally well defined ribosomal substrates such as tRNAs or antibiotics can bind.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The results discussed above prove that the labeled peptide stretches of proteins S12, S14, L17, L18, L27, and L35 are part of the spiramycin binding site in the ribosome (Fig. 4).Figure 4:Localization of dihydrospiramycin-labeled proteins (black circles) in the 70 S ribosome of Stöffler-Meilicke and Stöffler(1990). The view presents the 30 S subunit from the cytosolic site and the 50 S subunit from the luminal site. The circle indicates the most probable position of L35 (the most likely location of L35 in the circle is depicted by arrows). Dihydrospiramycin-labeled peptide regions of the respective ribosomal proteins have to be placed toward the interface gap. The two-way arrow depicts the discrepancy in the positioning of L17 in the Traut (Traut et al., 1986) and Walleczek model (Walleczek et al., 1988).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cross-linking of antibiotics to their functional site in combination with isolation and sequencing of the peptide-antibiotic cross-links is a direct approach to establish data concerning the peptide environment of these antibiotics in their functional binding site. Similar studies on the binding site of other antibiotics and ribosomal substrates at the peptide level, as recently described for puromycin (Bischof et al., 1994), lead to a more detailed insight into ribosomal structure-function correlation. INTRODUCTIONStudies on ribosomal structure and function have been greatly aided by the use of antibiotics acting as inhibitors of protein biosynthesis. Such studies have shed light on functional domains of the ribosome and also have helped to characterize the antibiotic binding sites (Cundliffe, 1990; Cooperman et al., 1990).The location of greatest functional and structural interest in the ribosome is the peptidyl transferase center, since it is the site where peptide bond formation takes place (Monro et al., 1969). To date, only limited data exist on the fine structure of the peptide moiety of this important enzymatic center, whereas detailed structural information is available on the rRNA moiety (Brimacombe et al., 1990).A more minute insight into the topography of the peptidyl transferase center can be obtained by cross-linking ribosomal antibiotics to their functional sites (Cooperman et al., 1990). Prominent among these antibiotics are macrolides. They can be roughly classified structurally and functionally into two main groups represented by spiramycin and erythromycin, respectively (Vazquez, 1979). The erythromycin group has a 13-carbon lactone ring that is glycosylated in two positions by different monosaccharides. The second group consists of a 15-carbon lactone ring system, usually derivatized at only one position by a disaccharide. Members of the erythromycin family apparently block protein synthesis only after the formation of several peptide bonds due to steric hindrance by the drug molecule (Moazed and Noller, 1987; Contreras and Vazquez, 1977). The spiramycin group of macrolides exerts its effects in the very early stage of peptide bond formation by competing for the ribosomal A-site with the incoming charged tRNA as determined by kinetic analysis with puromycin (Dinos et al., 1993). In this respect the effect is comparable with that of typical peptidyl transferase inhibitors such as chloramphenicol. The dissimilar modes of action of macrolides have mainly been attributed to the different sugar moieties attached to the lactone ring. So far, the question remains to be answered whether the two groups of macrolides have overlapping or in fact different binding-sites (Vazquez, 1979).A direct way to test both alternatives is to cross-link these molecules to their functional sites. Previous affinity labeling has revealed protein L22 as the major cross-linking site for erythromycin (Arévalo et al., 1988) and protein L27 for spiramycin (Tejedor and Ballesta, 1986), thus favoring the notion of different binding sites for the two groups. The amino acid residues involved in the respective cross-links have not been characterized so far but are of great interest in terms of elucidating the topography of the peptidyl transferase center.In this communication we report peptide regions of the small and large ribosomal subunit proteins cross-linked to spiramycin in the Escherichia coli ribosome that were identified by direct sequence analysis. The results present details of the peptide environment close to the peptidyl transferase center. The cross-linking data are integrated with the available data concerning the peptidyl transferase center topography."

In an effort specifically to inhibit collagenase expression, we have designed phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides, linked at the 5' ends with photoreactive 4'-(hydroxyethoxymethyl)-4,5',8-trimethyl-psoralen (HMT), and directed them against the 5' end of the collagenase mRNA. Two antisense-HMT molecules targeting a region overlapping the initiation codon were compared. Only one contained the HMT moiety targeting a 5'TpA on its complementary sense strand, and we observed greater than 50-fold improvement on the cross-linking of this antisense oligonucleotide to its target sequence after ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation. Likewise, sequence complementary to the 5'TpA target was also required to demonstrate specific inhibition of in vitro translation of collagenase mRNA. Tissue culture experiments, conducted by incubation of collagenase-specific antisense-HMT oligonucleotides with fibroblasts in monolayer or in 3-dimensional dermal equivalents, showed lowered collagenase levels 24 h after UVA irradiation as compared to controls. Initial screening of antisense oligomers for specific hybridization and photo-cross-linking is a useful step in the design of antisense oligonucleotides, and allowed us to design an HMT-linked antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide that specifically inhibits the expression of fibroblastic collagenase."

Neurotrophins exist in vivo as homodimers, but we show that neurotrophins can exist as heterodimers in vitro and are pluripotent, being able to bind and to activate different Trk tyrosine kinase receptors as well as promote neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells as effectively as wild type homodimers. These asymmetric neurotrophin dimers allow unique characterization of neurotrophin structure-function relationships with Trk receptors. The chimeric Trk activities of these heterodimers suggest an alternative model of neurotrophin-Trk receptor activation in which the critical Trk-interacting elements may be attributed to a single protomer."
